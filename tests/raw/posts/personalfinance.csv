fsoede,alexakmoeller,Putting more than 20% down on house?,"My husband and I are looking to buy a house next June if possible.

We currently have around $75K saved for a downpayment. A lot of this is in balanced funds, and once the markets return to normal, we should have an additional +$15K. In the next year, we are scheduled to save $40K between our incomes. This means, by next June, we will have around $130K for a downpayment. 

We are looking at houses around $400K, so we would need $80K down to avoid PMI.

We are now looking at 2 decisions:

* Putting $80K down 
* Putting $100K/$120K/etc. down 

Some addition information:

* We just signed a new lease from June 2020 to June 2021, so it doesn't make sense to move before then
* We both have credit scores \~800
* We contribute to our Roth IRA/401Ks
* We have an emergency fund

fsob8z,pilgrim202,Inflation-based increases at higher salaries,"I have an employee in IT making ~$110k/year salary (75th percentile for the job) who came to me unhappy with the 1% merit increases he’s received the past couple of years. He says 1% is for underperformers which he is not. He also pointed out that it didn’t keep pace with inflation.

I’ve been reading about the recommended 2-3% raises to compensate for inflation and thought it made sense. I took this up the chain and was told that at these higher salary levels there are no cost of living increases. Increases must be based on increased responsibility, high performance, etc. It does make sense that 2-3% is a lot more for someone making $110k than someone making half that. 

I’m relatively new to management so could use some help. How common are these COLA raises at these salary levels?

fsoajd,trilingualman20,New Mortgage guidelines allow 2 months savings for income eligibility?," [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fha-va-join-fannie-freddie-in-relaxing-appraisal-and-income-verification-standards/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/fha-va-join-fannie-freddie-in-relaxing-appraisal-and-income-verification-standards/)  Article linked for context:

  

I have recently read in several news articles that Fannie and Freddy have both changed their income eligibility reqs, along with Mortgages through FHA and the VA. The changes specified are that if income is unable to be verified through traditional means due to the situation with jobs and the COVID outbreak, income verification could be accomplished simply by verifying that the borrower has enough cash to cover 2 months of mortgage payments, including any PMI, Principal, Interest, and Property taxes. I’m curious as to whether it has been implemented yet, or if that is still being worked on, and whether my situation will allow it. I’ll outline what I believe to be relevant below.

I live in Rochester, New York. My FICO score is 723. I am currently on paid leave as a barista from starbucks. My store closed and I will be making about as much as I was before, without working. My rough salary from that is 17K, though it is part time and can vary, so I lowballed slightly from what I am currently making. I have previously been told it is not qualified, as I have been there less than a year, and lenders generally look for 2 years of part-time income to qualify. I am also a student using the Montgomery GI bill and receive a stipend of up to $2200 per month that I am in school, prorated for months that I do not attend for a full month. According to previous experience, it is not considered qualified income because it is dependent on me attending college. I’m expected to graduate with an associate’s this May and will be continuing with a Bachelor’s in the fall. I don’t pay tuition because NY has a tuition award for veterans that covers that, so I’m only responsible for books and fees, much of which is covered by Pell grant funds. I currently and in the hiring process at another part-time job contracting part time for a gross salary of at least 22k. I only have the background check to pass, which may take up to 2 months, though I don’t think it will take quite that long. My current debts are a car loan for which my payment is $351/ month, and about 8k in credit card debt that has a minimum payment just shy of $250/month. I currently have about $1000 in savings and am expecting $3350 in the next few weeks from my state and federal tax returns, along with the $1200 stimulus payment that will eventually be received. Total cash that I would have in savings after I get the refund are about 5k. The houses I’ve been looking at are around 80k, though I would be looking for a max mortgage closer to 85K depending on circumstances. I have not contacted an agent because I don’t want to waste their time if I’m still not even eligible, though I have been monitoring Zillow for options.

Can I realistically get a house based off those new guidelines?

Do those new guidelines apply to me?

fsnod8,neuroticandobscene,Can creditor use new collector circumvent CFPA?,"About a year ago I got notice of default for a grant repayment from my school from a collection agency. I disputed the default and requested more information. I received an account ledger that didn't include anything about the loan agreement and repayment plan. I again requested more information, specifically asking for the loan agreement and terms regarding acceleration, default, collection fees, etc. I didn't hear anything. 

A year later I get notice that the school is seizing my state tax return. I send a letter disputing for various reasons, including my prior requests for more information and dispute. 

A month later, I get 2 letters from a 2nd debt collector (different from the first), claiming I owe the debt. The letters refer to different accounts, but are for the same amount and clearly for the same debt previously claimed.

What effect is there to the creditor to using a new debt collector? I'd previously requested validation of the debt and did not receive it. Is the new collector in violation of any provision of the CPFA? Is the school for trying to seize my tax return without validating the debt? Can they simply ignore the validation requirements by hiring a new collector?

For what's it worth, in each of my communications I offered to settle for the amount of the claimed principal balance.

Any ideas? If you could point me toward the relevant statute it'd be much appreciated it'd be much appreciated.

fsnfzc,marcosama,I think i shouldn't refi my 4.5% mortgage to 3.125%,"Hi all,

This isn't quite an obvious question. I have a 152k mortgage at 4.5% but with an extra 102k deferred principal due when the 152k is paid off. I pay no interest on that 102k but if i were to refi i would have to do the whole amount (152k + 102k). Since wife and I are in our 40's and recently had a baby we're trying to see if a refi makes sense. Just about everyone tells me yes but I'm not so sure. I got some refi offers and put together some scenarios with Karls Mortgage Calculator. My current mortgage situation:

152k mortgage at 4.5%, 177mo remaining (14yrs, 9mo)

102k deferred principal (due when 152k is paid off. I pay no interest on this)

$333/mo auto payment, 47mo left. I can send this money to mortgage once car is paid off.

$450/mo investing to vanguard index fund (currently at 40k). This may help payoff mortgage in future.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are 3 options i thought of...

Ex1) Stay the course. Keep 4.5% mortgage, 102k balloon, keep funding vanguard

\*When car payment is done in 47mo, send that $333/mo to mortgage.

\*Keep funding vanguard at $450mo. Hopefully grows to 102k

Total cost is $301,322 ($47,322.41 is interest) and I'm done in 143 months (11yrs, 11mo).

&amp;#x200B;

Ex2) Refi to 3.125% ($262,332 Loan), keep funding vanguard

\*When car payment is done in 47mo, send that $333/mo to mortgage.

\*Keep funding vanguard at $450mo.

Total cost is $367,309 ($104,977.32 is interest) and I'm done in 263 months (21yrs, 11mo).

&amp;#x200B;

Ex3) Refi to 3.125% ($262,332 Loan), pay down mortgage instead of vanguard

\*When car payment is done in 47mo, send that $333/mo to mortgage.

\*Stop funding vanguard now, send that $450mo to mortgage.

Total cost is $332,902 ($70,570.23 is interest ) and I'm done in 183 months (15yrs, 3mo).

So I’m an idiot and I let my mom use my old paypal account to sell stuff on Ebay..

Today I got a collections letter from a 3rd party collections agency saying I owe $180. 

It says in there if I pay $180 by May 5th, Paypal will “cease efforts to collections”. Does this mean if I pay it that this WILL NOT hit my credit?

fsn1w3,throwawayflksdjfsld,Possibly Quitting Job During Situation Right Now,"Ok so I am in a very difficult position. I graduated college last May and have been working essentially a minimum wage job in San Diego and living with a handful of roommates to support myself. Believe me when I say I tried my damned hardest to get a higher paying job. I submitted hundreds upon hundreds of resumes for months after I graduated. I had peers and parents and friends look over my resumes and cover letters. I just kept getting rejected. I'm not sure if the market is bad in San Diego or if theres something wrong with me but that's the reality of the situation. 

Now I have a minimum wage job I really like and I like my coworkers as well. Now because of the current situation in California, we are deemed a nonessential business and have been closed. I have been told I still have my job for whenever we reopen. The only problem is my lease is up at the end of May, and the roommates I'm living with now are leaving to go live back with their parents because this situation has gotten rid of their incomes as well. So this means after May I am left without a place to live in San Diego. I just don't know if it is a smart situation to find some random roommates to live with and burn rent money until the stay at home order is lifted so I can return to my minimum wage job, or to move back in with my parents up in northern California during all this. To make it more complicated, I don't get along that well with my parents and it feels stupid to quit a job to move back in with my parents during a time when it is going to be so hugely difficult to find any work at all. I'm also likely not going to get a gov check because my parents wrongfully claimed me as dependent on their tax return and it'll be too late when the fix goes through so I cant count on those $1200.

 Salary: $61,450

Salary predictions: Most likely mediocre, I’d assume around &lt;1-2% increase a year capped at $100k. Would rather assume low than vice versa. Just not a career focused person to be honest.

Situation:

Roth IRA: $9.6k (putting $500 a month)

Trad 401k: $1.7k (5% of salary a year, around $256 a month)

Roth 401k: $2.5k (5% of salary a year, around $256 a month)

Cash: \~$10k (save around 700-1000 a month) (After 15k will start a HYSA)

Debt: 0 (thank you parents)

I have a couple of questions and concerns.

Question and concern: I read this page saying that it’s best to decrease your taxable income as much as possible, [https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/](https://www.gocurrycracker.com/roth-sucks/)

What are everyones thoughts on this given my situation (specifically my income not likely to increase significantly)? Should I change my investment strategy, I can do 30% Trad 401k (with no roth IRA or 401k) and have it basically be the same amount invested as everything listed above. 

Questions 2: Does this REALLY matter in the long run or is the difference between a couple of thousand dollars in the long run?

Concern 2: Am I doing enough? I would like to be able to retire and have \~70k of disposable income each year by the age of 60/65. 

Is it just me or does anyone else feel like regardless of the amount they save, it won’t be enough? lol

TL;DR : Is Roth investing not worth it and should decreasing your taxable income be your first priority?

fsmuth,Frank_S3455,Deposited joint tax return check into my personal account - how badly did I screw up?,"So, as a short back story, my wife and I are currently separated.  We are still on reasonably good terms and have been filing our taxes as married filing jointly.  Normally our tax refund is sent through direct deposit, so this isn’t an issue, but we needed to amend a previous year’s return which resulted in a check being mailed to me.  The check was made out to both of us (with an ’and’ because apparently that matters) and without thinking I signed it and deposited it into my personal account yesterday using the bank’s app.  (We don’t have any joint accounts anymore).  The bank accepted the deposit yesterday and has made the money available in my account today, but now I’m a bit afraid that they might still reject it and remove the money from my account.

For what it’s worth, I’m not trying to take money without my wife being aware.  In fact, as soon as I know the check has cleared and won’t be returned I’m going to transfer most of the money to her.  Because the check was mailed to me and we live in different cities and don’t see each other very often, especially because of the covid situation, it was easier for me to deposit the check and then transfer the money once it cleared rather than trying to get the check to her.

In any case, what’s going to happen here?  Is the bank going to reject the deposit?  Is there a chance it will still go through?  How long should I wait before I can be comfortable that the check has actually checked and the money won’t suddenly be removed from my account?",5,1585693644,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsmuth/deposited_joint_tax_return_check_into_my_personal/,personalfinance,1

fsmu8g,longscale,"Removal of excess Roth IRA contribution coded as ""J - early distribution from roth"" by Vanguard on 1099-R","Hi /r/personalfinance!

When importing my 1099-Rs from Vanguard into TurboTax, I see \~$17k total distributions, of which \~$5.5k are taxable distributions. I believe I made a mistake in how I attempted the backdoor Roth, but still feel that none of the transactions should code as distributions, or be taxable. Let me explain:

In April 2019 I **contributed** $6k to a Roth IRA for 2019, but then realized I was over the income limits. I removed the money from the Roth by making a **distribution** to my non-IRA brokerage account. (Likely my mistake, should have been a ""**withdrawal**"", I believe?) I then called Vanguard, whose agents helped me move the money *back into* the Roth IRA, coded as a **rollover**, and then **recharacterize** it as a Traditional IRA contribution. A couple days later I then **converted** all of the traditional IRA back to the Roth to finish the backdoor Roth.

I've talked to representatives at Vanguard, who say they can only code the transactions as they happened, and CPAs at TurboTax, who say they can only ensure I've entered the information from Vanguard correctly.

Now, I'm unsure how TurboTax really interprets this data, but it does end up showing \~$17k total distributions, of which \~$5.5k are taxable distributions. If that's just how it is because I messed up undoing my initial over-contribution, so be it—I've learned a lesson to ask first, act later. However, if there are any pointers as to how I should report this situation to the IRS/through TurboTax, I'd be grateful for any insights.

However, they are lowballing us, trying to settle for much less than the actual value of our items. Of the total value of our stolen possessions, the home insurance company offered less than 20% of it.

What can I do?

fsm5sq,theBlackTexan,I'm filing an amended tax return and have difficultly understanding the 'Taxes Paid' portion of 1040x. Anyone have experience with this?,"Hello,

I'm using H&amp;R Block to file an Amended Tax Return (2019) that I sent in a few days ago. This is my first time filing for taxes. 

The only change I made was unmarking myself as being claimed as my parents' dependent, mutually agreed upon, as I lived/worked/paid rent on my own for the entirety of last year. The recent stimulus bill gives nothing both in the $1200 check, and beefed up UI benefits to those marked as a dependent so I realize I have to amend it ASAP. 

I'm having an issue with the 'Taxes You Paid' portion of the amended return. Here are the two prompts I'm given. 


**Taxes Paid With Original Return**
*I'm assuming this is the amount already paid in the year before a refund? Meaning, the amount paid before deducting my actual liability?* 

**Taxes Paid after return filed**

fsm20v,mostlytoast,Refinancing an unsecured RV loan. Is it possible?,"I’m looking to refinance an unsecured loan on a custom RV. My interest rate is currently 6.3%, and I’ve found several loan providers offering ~4.8% on a longer term RV refinancing loan. I have about 6 years left on the loan and I can afford the current monthly payments. I plan to continue to pay the new loan off at the same rate, but I figured it was a no-brainer to get a lower interest rate with a longer term so I have the flexibility of making lower payments if I hit lean times in the future.

I have two questions:

1) How does refinancing an unsecured vehicle loan work? Since the title is in my name (not the bank’s), is it even possible? Or is it essentially the same process as refinancing a standard vehicle loan? I wasn’t able to find any guidance online.

2) Assuming it’s possible to refinance the loan, am I missing something here? Is there a downside I’m not seeing? I'm thinking I'd probably wait to see if interest rates drop in the coming months before going through with it.

I plan to talk to a credit union about it, but I thought getting a little more knowledge about the process beforehand could only help.

If you’re wondering why I didn’t get the lower interest rate loan to start, it’s because the RV is a custom camper van, and the original financing situation with a dealership and a custom van conversion was too complicated for those lenders to touch. Now that it’s registered as a motorhome, I'm hoping things might be more straightforward.

Thanks for any help you’re able to offer. I have learned so much from this community and appreciate all the collective wisdom here!",0,1585691092,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsm20v/refinancing_an_unsecured_rv_loan_is_it_possible/,personalfinance,1
fsm1cd,LAThrowAway78,Questions About Roth IRA Conversions,"Hello,

My wife and I have been unable to contribute to an IRA due to income limits for the last few years...  and with the dip in the  market, I have decided now is as good of time as any to convert our traditional IRAs, pay the the taxes... so we can contribute in the coming years.

I have a few questions about this:

* As far as I understand, I only pay taxes on the gains... so if I actually paid 8k over 2 years and the value is 13k, I just pay tax on the 5k of gains. Is that correct?
* Is there a penalty (other than the taxes) for doing this?
* Am I taxed at my current income rate?
* Will the taxes be assessed this year or next?

And finally, I saw the following notice: Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Job Aids Act, the recharacterization of Roth IRA Conversions will no longer be permitted in tax years 2018 and beyond. Should you proceed with this request, you will not be able to recharacterize this conversion.

I want to be sure I understand. I believe it means I can complete the conversion - but that action is no-go-backsies... so if my tax liability this year goes way up, I can't change my mind and undo it. Is that correct?

fslzjc,Kody624,"Credit score is stuck at 679, when it needs to be 680 to be approved for a home loan.","Hey everyone. My wife begins her medical residency in June, and now that we have income (we were both students for a long time, and I am still a student), we are looking to purchase a house. She has better credit than me, but the other advantage of the loan being in her name is that she can get a physician's loan, which allows for no money down, no PMI, student loans not being factored into DTI, and several other things.

My wife checked her three-credit report on Experian last week. According to the numbers she received, she met the requirement of the middle score being 680 - her low number was 683, her middle number was 690, and her high number was 692 (Experian, Transunion, and Equifax, respectively). After seeing that, she called a mortgage banker in the same city as her residency and inquired about a physician's loan. He pulled her numbers, but for him, the numbers came back as 665 (Transunion), 679 (Equifax), and 702 (Experian). We were a little confused as to why his results were different, but he recommended that we try and pay a chunk of one of her credit cards to get the score to go up.

We paid roughly 50% of the balance on one of her credit cards and waited a couple days before checking her score again, even getting the credit card company to push through an update to the credit bureaus. When she checked her scores on Experian again, they were 685 (Experian), 690 (Transunion), and 698 (Equifax). We thought we were clear, so she called the same guy at the bank today and had him pull the scores again. When he pulled the scores, they came back as 678 (Transunion), 679 (Equifax), and 725 (Experian). Yet again, we fall short by one point.

Is there any reason for this discrepancy? Why are his numbers so different, and why did the middle number on his end stay the same, even after the credit score went up? Any advice/insight is much appreciated.",35,1585690873,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fslzjc/credit_score_is_stuck_at_679_when_it_needs_to_be/,personalfinance,5

fslqie,EdwardDoheny,"Extended warranty/pre-paid service plan - $4,600 total","Posted this already in /r/askcarsales but am hoping to get more feedback here. I think I already know the answer but wondering what you guys think about this since you deal with this stuff for a living. I recently bought a 2019 Mazda CX5 with 22k miles on it from a dealer, and was talked into taking a financing discount of 0.7% if I signed up for two services through Portfolio Protection ($2,400) and something called ""SBM Ultimate Maintenance"" ($1,800) on the invoice. Portfolio service contract is 84 mo, Ultimate Maintenance is 60 mo. As far as I can tell, it overlaps with the rest of my 2 years (I think) of regular warranty for regular service and anything else that breaks, and I have to go back to the selling dealer for servicing. I also tacked on a $400 ""Express Five"" Portfolio surface protection package for dings and dents.

I did the math in the office but I must've been tired because after I got home, I recalculated it and found that the total cost of $4,600 was almost totally offset by the APR reduction. I'd just be paying an extra $900 per year for the extra stuff. I drive very little, maybe max 5k per year, almost exclusively in the city. Could someone please help me determine if I should keep these products? If not I'm going to call and cancel both packages today and just take the higher interest rate. Google consensus is that the two big packages are not worth it for most people, although I think I might stick with the $400 surface protection package just in case I get a dent I don't want to have to go through my normal insurance claims process.

fslk06,patternedfabric,"Currently unemployed &amp; discovered an old 401k - should I take the money out, transfer it to something else, or leave it?","Hello - I’ve been unemployed since Feb 2020. I have been actively searching for jobs with unfortunately few callbacks, and my chances look worse at the moment due to COVID leading to temporary/permanent business closures. Presently my boyfriend is paying about $1,500/month to cover my expenses/bills. 

As for the 401k from a different previous employer, I’ve discovered it has $4,000 accrued. It is in what was described to me as a “temporary holding place”, a “trust bank IRA”, which is costing me $6 on a quarterly basis. I was told there are tax penalties if I cashed out, but I’m not sure what that dollar amount could look like. 

I haven’t filed for unemployment because the reality of what’s happening here in Florida is just now setting in. I’m 26 y/o, and my only work experience has been in retail/call center environments. I was under the impression I could get another job like that easily. However, I cannot put myself nor my household at risk of exposure to COVID, so now I am boxed in to work from home sales/customer service jobs, which I’ve had difficulties getting noticed by probably due to the massive influx of applicants (and because my work history isn’t wildly impressive). 

Should I file for unemployment? Should I take the money out of my 401k and live off of that so I can relieve my boyfriend for a few months while I look for work? Or should I transfer it into a different type of account so it can grow - or is that not a thing right now because of the crash? How do I calculate how much it’d cost to cash out a 401k?

Edit: I forgot to add, my total debt is currently $5,438 between a car loan, a personal loan, and two credit cards. Should I consider using my 401k money to pay off that debt as to lower my monthly expenses since I’m out of work?

fslgq9,bratelynn99,Having issues with leased car/the manager hates me?,"Okay so backstory. I’m 19 and I’ve been having a really rough time with vehicles these past 10 months, my Ford Escape died so I bought a cheap Jeep which lasted for two months, when it unexpectedly died I had no where to turn due to my family disowning me and I needed a vehicle immediately. I tried applying to finance a $5000 car and got denied for lack of credit history. So the only place I would get approved was to lease a vehicle. I chose a 2010 equinox and put $2000 down and made $600 in payments on it and only drove it around 10 days in two months due to the many issues it had. 

They transferred me from the equinox to the loaner car I was using (2005 Buick LaCrosse) they restarted my lease so I was out $2600 and am being charged $15,000 for this Buick in a 3.5 year lease, I felt ripped off because of the money I lost and the buick is worth around $3,000. They told me that the Buick was only $9,700 but when I reviewed the lease all the other fees added up to $15,000 total. But I was fine with it because I finally had a vehicle that was running unlike the equinox did.

A week after the Buick was put into my name it started having many problems that I noticed, (abs/brake/check engine/traction control light turned on, radio would randomly short out which would follow with the gas gauge and temp gauges going all the way down and the car would start to lose power, the windows won’t roll up, the temp thermostat needed replaced the wheel bearings needed replaced) and the list goes on. 

I messaged the manager and told her about the problems and she essentially told me to go get it fixed. I left it alone and messaged her a month later and asked if it was possible to do a lease transfer. She said no. So I asked “in the sense of if my partner and I separated could anything be done to where the lease could be in their name? (my partner and I aren’t separating but I was curious) or if the car just wasn’t reparable anymore if anything could be done and she said “Im sorry but that is pretty hard to believe considering how long you used it for a loaner car before you transferred into it voluntarily and happily. Nothing I can do for you in that regard. Sorry your marriage isn’t working out.” To which I replied, “that was completely unprofessional, I am disappointed.” She responded with, “Obviously you misinterpret emails and should no longer email me questions if you do not like the response. Try the phone. My direct line is...” 

I was so pissed that she was talking to me that way but I didn’t respond. I went to google to go to delete my positive review that I had put on their previously but it wouldn’t let me delete, only edit. So I changed it to a one star and said, “do not go here for the life of you! I was given two overpriced lemon vehicles. And the manager was completely rude and unprofessional!” The manager responded to comment saying that what I was saying was ‘Libel’ and that “I came to her about my relationship problems” and that what I was saying was against the law. 

I am so pissed and I don’t know what to do. The vehicle isn’t going to run for much longer.",3,1585689186,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fslgq9/having_issues_with_leased_carthe_manager_hates_me/,personalfinance,1

Everything I read said to keep my old one open as having a long credit history is important and helpful. So far so good.

I get a letter in the mail a month later, and have to pay a bunch of late fees, in addition to likely having my credit score affected.

Now obviously this is my fault for not noticing the email that my ""dead"" account had a balance, but can I reasonably ask my old credit card company to cut me some slack, as both times I paid the outstanding balance including late fees within minutes of opening the letter?

Along with another update! I have just heard back from the ‘office’ TODAY!!! March 31st 2020, even though the offices are closed for quarantine. the person who called me was at their home, and they are the doctor’s ‘money handler’. She called me because she saw my bill was so late and I let her know ALL ABOUT how I have been trying to contact them weeks and weeks ago to try to pay, switch to my new insurance, or reach someone who knows anything.
She apologizes, then tells me my new insurance goes through a different payment process (jellin? Sounded like that) and I would need to pay out of pocket. I said, “you can talk to my new insurance about it because they’ve been trying to reach you for weeks and you haven’t returned their calls.” And gave her my insurance info...she removed the missed appointment fee from the last notice and tells me she will try to submit the bill and we will see, but she’s sure they will deny it and I’m going to have to pay out of pocket. Before she hung up, I got a new phone number now....just in case there are any more problems. I’m sure this isn’t the end of it yet.

Someone had mentioned in my last post that this business could be an insurance scam? Does this seem likely?

fskyqy,potluckluckster,US/UK Citizen - Form 8938,"Hello all. I'm a dual US/UK citizen and moved to Washington, DC from London at the end of 2018. I'm currently filing my taxes on TurboTax and realized I need to separately file a 8938. I've submitted FBAR's in the past, but this is the first time I've been above the threshold to submit the 8938 Form.

I'm having difficulty figuring out exactly how to fill it in accurately. In 2019 I had two main foreign accounts. First was my personal Llyods checking account (which had about 30K GBP in it) and secondly my work pension with Scottish Widows (also another 30K GBP). 

I've since transferred the money from my checking account , but plan to keep my pension until I retire. My question is, do I need to disclose any earnings on my pension even if I'm not realising those gains until I retire? Typically this wouldn't be difficult, but due to regulatory reasons I can't actually access my Scottish Widows account in the US, so have no idea what interest has been gained/lost. 

I know these questions are potentially stupid, but any advice on how to properly fill in the forms? Any resources that lay it out in layman's terms? I know I don't owe money, but still am unclear what I need to include/fill out.

Thanks in advance for any direction.",1,1585687633,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fskyqy/usuk_citizen_form_8938/,personalfinance,1

fskuct,thr0wm3a4aypl34s3,(US) Should I file for bankruptcy as an unemployed person?,"I need some advice. I’m roughly $100K in debt, I have no income, and my bills are starting to default. I think I should probably file for bankruptcy, but I’m not sure if there are other steps to exhaust. I’ve spoken with my creditors and they’ve given me extra months/ put me on payment plans where available. I've also spoken to a debt relief counselor in December, and she suggested bankruptcy might be the best option. I am single, have never been married and have no children.

I’m in a terrible situation and I recognize while part of it is out of my hands, a lot of it is my own fault. I’ve lost loved ones, I’ve been physically and mentally ill, I’ve been laid off multiple times. I let things go too long without intervening, but I could not handle so many fires at once, and my finances got neglected. 

I was laid off in February of 2018 and not employed again until July of 2019. During that time, I lived on credit cards after closing out my 401K (desperate times, please don’t lecture me about this – I already know it was a bad idea, but I didn’t have any options and I don’t have a way to change it).

I was let go again on February 5 -- I took a week of vacation (stayed with friends, paid with airline miles) and when I came home, my boss informed me I wouldn’t be paid for my previous two weeks of work, that I wasn’t getting holiday pay, and that I needed to find a new job because of COVID-19's impact on the company income. I’ve applied for unemployment, but I got a note saying I don’t qualify because I wasn’t employed long enough.

I’ve been searching for jobs, but my industry is frozen. I’ve been applying for essential roles, as well, but no calls back from any of the grocery stores I’ve applied at. Until I find a job, and probably even after, I think I’m going to need to file bankruptcy. 

I owe about $4000 in taxes from withdrawing my 401K. My tax refund this year automatically went to paying that total down.

I quit my job to start my own self-employed venture in October 2018, and decided to just continue with my old employer's plan to make things easier for myself. The dreaded day is coming where my COBRA benefit is ending, and after lots of googling I'm still very unsure how to go forward.

Questions:

* My current policy is a high-deductible HSA plan, with great benefits once the benefits are met. If I could, I would definitely prefer to just stay on my current plan even if it meant an increase to my premium. Is this even possible? Would I reach out to my company's HR reps?

* If I can't continue with my current plan, how does moving to a new plan work? My deductible is about halfway met already, do I have to find an ""equivalent"" HSA plan? What happens to my current deductible if I go with a new insurance company?

* Where do I even go to shop for insurance policies? I'm confused on whether I go to my state's official website to shop policies, or if I call the insurance companies directly.",7,1585687041,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsks23/my_cobra_policy_is_ending_april_30th_unsure_what/,personalfinance,1

**Could someone clarify how to determine how much tax to be withheld total for my main job and my independent contractor work?** Once I can do that, then I can ask my employer to withhold taxes so that I don't have to make quarterly payments (prefer more regular steady cash flow).

She offered to move up the start date even should I get laid off or need to.

Below are some pertinent details, I'm wondering if there is anything I have missed:

* Current insurance is a HDHP, new one is not, so I'm putting most of 2 of my 3 remaining paychecks in my HSA to maximize pre-tax deductions.
* I will consider making a post-tax transfer from my bank account to the HSA before leaving my job to reach the yearly max. (Does anyone know the deadline for doing this transaction?)
* New job has 6 months before I'm 401(k) eligible, so I'm raising my contribution rate from 22% (18% 401(k), 4% Roth 401(k)) to 31% (22% 401(k), 9% Roth 401(k)) before leaving. 
* I'm looking into setting up an IRA to be funded for the 6 months that I can't contribute to a workplace retirement plan. Then I'll re-evalute.

As you've probably heard, the federal government has suspended all federally held student loan payments for the next 6 months. My question is, how should I proceed with this as my financial situation has not significantly changed, not yet at least. Should I:

- Continue making payments as I have been.

- Continue paying loans but apply them to the loans with the highest interest rates. If so, do I apply my payment to a single loan that has the highest interest or distribute among several high interest loans?

- Forgo student loan payments altogether and apply that money toward credit card debt (@ 20+% interest).

- Put that money toward my (basically non-existent) emergency fund.",27,1585684480,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsjygs/what_to_do_with_suspended_student_loan_payments/,personalfinance,1

fsjwmu,Fruitcake36,UK Employment Pension Plan - Not understanding value of it,"  

Not sure if this is in the right section but couldn't see where else was best appropriate.

I'm struggling to determine whether this is a valuable thing to invest in or not. With my current salary and setup of myself paying in 5% into my UK pension as well as my employer paying in 3%, I stand to have £4,164 added to my pension pot per annum from a pay reduction of £2,256 per annum from my payslip. Not bad I guess, as in I almost double my actual money.

But I'm not the kind of person that sees myself sitting in a steady office job for the next 30 years. I don't see myself living that office life where I spend the next 30 years paying off a mortgage, travelling into the city and living that standard life. I'm not sure what I want to do. I might go travelling for a couple of years at some point and will probably leave the office life behind and retreat to a smaller place where the cost of living is far cheaper. I also don't see the value in getting a big pension pot at say 65/70, when I'm old and frail and won't enjoy travel experiences and life in the same way as being a younger person. Heck, I might die before I reach retirement age, or be gravely ill to even care about some pension pot. There are so many variables, and that's the issue. In my hometown you can buy a nice house for £170,000 - if I decide to move back here I will have this paid off before I retire in which case, why do I even need a pension pot if I'll have no major financial outgoings? When the money I could hold instead can actually make a real difference to my life as I'm alive, in the present, in the moment. I feel like losing something up to £200 every month is more painful somehow.

I've never really had this conversation with someone and so I just want to see different opinions on this. I feel like I'm missing something because it's only ever talked about as being a company benefit and I only seem to hear people drooling about a pension pot plan and I honestly just don't quite get it.

Would be great to see how others perceive this or if others see it exactly as I do?",9,1585684322,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsjwmu/uk_employment_pension_plan_not_understanding/,personalfinance,2

fsjw8e,scuba_steve94,Trying to get the best auto policy for my classic car. Any advice?,"A bit of background, I have a classic car that's valued at about $25k. It currently has a regular insurance policy, however if it were to be victim of a total loss, I wouldn't get nearly that amount.

I have been looking into some classic car insurance companies- Hagerty, Grundy, American Collector, AAA, Amica to name a few. Unfortunately I don't qualify for their policies, since my classic car is my only car, thus it's my ""primary car"".

Although it's my only car, I don't drive it to work (I take public transit), I take it out on the weekends (sometimes, but not in the winter), and it's garaged.

The only insurance provider that was able to provide me with a declared value policy was State Farm, and while their policy seems to be best it limits my driving to about 3k mi per year. I usually drive around 5k mi per year, usually weekend trips in the summer, going back home to visit family etc.

We've exchanged many emails, I shared lots of pics/videos and had a (~1 hr) phone conversation last night.  I'm a pretty cautious fellow and there's no reason to believe he's not a real person who actually wants to buy this car.

If it wasn't for all this coronavirus shit, he would fly down, look at he car in person, give me cash (or a cashier's check, after I called his bank to verify) and I'd give him the title and the keys.

Because of all this coronavirus shit, he [wisely] does not want to fly down here.  Instead he is planning to hire a 3rd party inspection service to look over the car and then pay an auto transport company and have it shipped back to him.  I don't mind helping coordinate especially given the circumstances.

Presuming he does the inspection and we want to proceed, what's the safest way to actually broker this transaction?

From my perspective, I want payment before I sign over the title or even let the car go on the truck.  Obviously I can't let it all go and hope for the best.  If I were to hold back the title, it gets shipped and he's like 'now that I see it in person, I think it's worth a thousand less' I have no recourse other than to ship it back at my expense.

Similarly if he just sends me the money, what's to prevent me from not signing over the title?  His only recourse would be to call the police, or file a lawsuit, or some such thing.

When the market plummeted recently I didn’t take as big of a hit since 15% of my money was in bonds. What does that mean for me? Now is the perfect time to swap to 100% stocks while they’re on sale.

I sold off all of my target retirement shares and bought 100% VTSAX today. A conversion I’ve been wanting to do for a while but what better time than now (or last week, or a month from now).

I come from a low income background and now is the first time I will start earning some real money. I would like to be responsible with my finances right from the start. I have acquired an exciting full time position and will start working later this year. 

I live in California and my income before taxes will be 93k. My employer has a 401k match plan of 2:8 (I put in two percent and they match eight). I currently have 38k in student loans with an interest rate of 5.5%. Moreover, I have no savings. I expect to spend around 1.6k a month in rent plus utilities (Bay Area rent) which becomes around 30 percent of my monthly income after tax. 

I would like some advice on how to manage my money effectively. How much of my monthly income should I invest in my 401k, I have read that 10% is a safe bet but since my employer matches 8% I do not know if that is a wise decision rather than investing in a Roth IRA. I would like to be able to start saving for a home (10 years from now) as well as an eye surgery (2 years from now). I also have very specific goals that I want to accomplish such as helping my mom retire. I am not sure how much per month I should put aside in order to help her with retirement 10 years from now. Moreover, I expected to save 5% of my after tax income for an emergency fund. I will also get 6-7k yearly in bonuses, i am not really sure how I should invest these. 

I know these are very specific and maybe I would need a financial advisor/ planner to help me. Are there any websites/advisors that have helped you manage your budget in the past?

On December 2019 I financed a new car with a solid downpayment. Nevertheless, the interest rate that I got from Chase was about 9.8% for the 3 years loan.

Now, several months later, I got my first credit score (\~640). So I'm trying to realize whether there is a chance for refinancing and reducing the interest rate accordingly.

Based on this [post](https://www.thebalance.com/best-banks-for-refinancing-auto-loans-4178024) there is a list of banks that provide refinancing options:

* LightStream
* CarFinance
* CapitalOne
* BOA
* AutoPay
* LendingClub
* Consumers credit union

So much so, that they’ve offered to make a $1000 contribution to a 529 account so that the money can grow over time and help with what I’m assuming will be absurd educational expenses 18 years from now.

Here’s the issue:   We don’t have kids yet.  We’ve been trying for a while and we think that it’s time to consult some doctors and determine a path forward.   I know that fertility treatments can be very expensive and are often not covered by insurance.   Is there any mechanism by which my parents could take that $1000 and put it in some sort of tax advantaged account for use on health expenses instead?  

I know that we’d lose the compounding and that I should be thankful, which I am.   I just don’t want my parents to put money into a 529 if it turns out that kids aren’t actually in the cards for us.  If biological kids aren’t a possibility, I’m sure we’ll go the adoption route, but I’d think that there are a whole other set of complications and complexities involved with that.

The debt is split along 3 cards, each of which has a near 20% interest rate. My mortgage has a 4.5% rate. Two of the cards have smaller limits ( 1 at $1800 with $1400 currently on it, and the other maxed out at $4500), so I'd be able to pay these off quickly and start applying that money towards the larger card ($9000)

My bank is offering up to 12 months of forbearance. I'm a hard worker for a large, stable IT company so I'm not concerned about losing my job at this time. I was recently given a promotion (with a small raise) as well, so I'm secure in my standing.

I have since been working a dead end job that I hate, making $45k/yr, and I have applied to many other jobs for 4 years with no success (got 1-2 offers, would have been major pay downgrades). 

I spent a lot of time volunteering and discovered that mental health nursing is actually be a better path for me, so I took all the prerequisites and applied broadly to different programs. I was rejected a lot, but surprisingly I was accepted to a Direct Entry master's program at one of the best schools in the country for my desired field. 

Now, a word about these programs: they receive a TON of hate, because you go from a non-nursing degree to becoming a nurse practitioner in 2 years with no prior experience. I generally agree with the idea that experience first is better - however, this program may the exception, because it has an excellent reputation of producing well-prepared, specialized NPs.

I would graduate as a psych NP, and they generally start at around $90K a year and go as high as $150K depending on location. I have shadowed them, so I know what I'm getting into.

Many have told me to just go to community college to get an ADN ($12K), then let an employer pay for the BSN. While this is certainly a great option financially, 1) I live in CA, where all nursing programs are crazy competitive and impacted 2) many places won't hire you with an ADN anymore, especially in CA. And 3) this will take forever, my prereqs may expire (they last ~5 years) while I'm trying to get in, and honestly I am so tired of working my stupid job. 

I did get into 1 BSN program that would be about $50K total, which I have considered - but if I decided to become an NP after that, it would end up costing almost the same overall in the end as the Direct Entry program costs in one go. 

Is this the worst idea? Will I be drowning in debt forever? 

TL;DR $150K+ debt from a top school to become a psych nurse practitioner - bad idea?",35,1585681787,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsj3u9/considering_a_very_expensive_graduate/,personalfinance,2
fsj3gd,Spiah,"Old college apartment sent me to collections, months later now requesting more money?","I got a collections letter from some agency on behalf of my college apartment from 3 years ago. Apparently I owed them for final utilities (which they charged 2 months after I moved out and never sent any notification). Because the charge was only $30.70, I paid it and moved on with my life.

4 months later I get a letter from the apartment agency saying I owe them another $12.68. Apparently this is because the debt collector only sent them a check for $19.02 despite me paying $30.70, and I have a credit card statement to prove that. They're telling me that I have to contact the debt collector and settle the account myself. Yeah good luck trying to get ahold of them. They'll only take account inquiries via snail mail.

It's a small sum of money but the situation feels very unfair, I paid the money owed of me. I don't want to pay any more. Is it the apartment complex's or my responsibility to contact the debt collector if they didn't send the correct amount to the complex?

fsj35l,lifeisruf,Having issues getting in touch with credit card companies...,"Hi Everyone,

I am having some issue right now, much like everyone else in this crazy time. It’s starting to get super frustrating and I’m hoping that someone might have some alternate numbers or advice on how I could achieve what I’m looking for.

So basically my wife and I are trying to buy a house in the next month or so, but I have a lot of credit card debt and collections that I’ve finally gotten to the point where I can pay them all off after receiving my tax return.

My plan was to call every single debt one by one and pay them all off and boost my score up so that we could secure a loan on a house within the next month.

However, now with all of this Coronavirus mess going on, I’ve only been able to get in touch with 2 of the companies so far. Citibank for example, when I call them their automated system just says they’re closed. No hint of when they’ll be able to receive calls, nothing. And they are one of the holders of one card that has not been sent to collections, so I’m trying to pay it off ASAP and I can’t because of all of this and it’s the most frustrating thing ever.

I’m finally to a point where I can literally wipe all of my debt clean and have a clean credit report for the first time in my life and now because of this virus stuff I’m unable to.

TL;DR: Does anyone have any idea how I can reach Citibank to pay off a card? All of their numbers say they are closed.",7,1585681727,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsj35l/having_issues_getting_in_touch_with_credit_card/,personalfinance,2

fsixdr,goddamnsundayscaries,How to ask for a raise/promotion in current climate,"My performance review is tomorrow. I have been with this private university for a year and a half. 

Background: I started last January and loathed it because the position I was in was looked down upon, stressful, and long hours (call center). I ended up transferring over to a wonderful job I love within the university. Because it was only 8 months into my previous job that I had been with the university, HR and my (now) boss, said they couldn’t offer me a competitive offer and I had to keep my same pay (lateral move). Not a problem with me. I chose happiness over pay. One caveat is the new job is 35 hours weekly as compared to the 40 hours I was working, so I was automatically going to be making less. I also make hourly, not salary like 98% of my new colleagues. I’ve been at the new position since Sept 2019 and have taken on many different projects and roles that I was not hired for (but gladly picked up). I’ve been SEVIS certified for international students I-20s. I do a decent amount every day, and (though I know this really isn’t something I should do) usually work sporadically on my hour long break if any inquiries come up. 

Now that corona has come up, I find it particularly difficult to bring up the lateral move that is costing me $6,000 less a year. I am so over the moon thankful I have a job in this climate, and it sounds greedy, but it has been a strain to make less than what I had made before. I still live within my means, pay my student loans, utilities, and rent (my state’s rent is HIGH especially in a city environment). My mother works in HR and has coached me to say that my understanding that this was a lateral move has caused my compensation to change due to the hourly differences and that in order to make this a truly lateral move would it be possible to change this? 

What I truly want is to be on salary and to have a title change since my title is similar to the work study kids that work UNDER me, but I know title changes mean a substantial raise. I will take what I can get though. Again, I am thankful, extremely so, but I would like to be paid for what I do (and this university does not lack funds trust me).

   About 6 years ago I got a divorce and was drinking very heavily, I didn't care about anything and that led me to not filing my taxes that year. I kept drinking and not caring about things and was so scared about not filing the year before that I didn't file again the next year. As of now it's been about six years since I've filed income taxes (I'm in Missouri if that helps any). I've since finally got sober and am in the long process of fixing all the crap I messed up during that time. 
   I have my W2's from this year and last year, I only made a few hundred dollars on a 1099 in 2017, in 2016 I have no reportable income as I worked for my family basically just to have a place to live and food to eat. I worked for a couple of months in 2015. In 2014 I worked the full year with lots of overtime. I didn't make a huge amount but if I recall correctly it was about $45,000.
   I'm in the process of trying to access my W2's from 2014 and 2015.
   I have a few main questions, should I go ahead and file my W2's from this year and last year on my own right now? I'm 99% sure I won't owe any taxes and most likely will get a refund as I don't make very much. Or is this too big a thing for me to handle and I should hire a professional? I have very little extra money and I'm assuming this won't be cheap, any idea what help with this would cost? Do you have any recommendations on who or what type of person /company I should seek for help? 
   My last question is, the last time I filed taxes I was living with my ex, could the IRS or state already be coming after me and I don't know it since the last address they have for me is an old one? I would think my ex would tell me about any mail I would have received from them but that's not a sure thing.

fsiw0n,skyloblu,Building Credit Profile,"Hello everyone! Hope you're safe and healthy. I am currently looking at building my credit. No specific reason, just want to get ahead of the game as I'm only 20. Experian currently lists me at 724 after 11 months of on-time payments with a single credit card open. 

I'm looking to build/expand my profile. I've read a few things about getting a credit builder loan since I don't plan on having an auto loan or a mortgage anytime soon but I'm weary of them. I'm not sure how much it will actually help my credit score so I decided to look at applying for another credit card.

First is first, spending habits. I dont hurt financially so I only use my credit card for things like monthly subscriptions to fast food. Just to build credit basically. I have a credit line of $500 on my current card and I've never used over $25.

Second, I always pay before the deadline. Not always 100% of the credit used but always pay the minimum payment times 2 atleast. Even more most times. 
 
Third, I do not want a hard inquiry. I would like pre-approval or soft inquiry cards. 
 
I care very little to the APR and fees as I pay on time and don't do things like money transfers. I'm asking more of what Rewards or cards are better based off this subreddits experience. 

Here are the top 3 I was interested in that experiean recommended for me.

Discover It Cash Back - I like the cash back match at the end of first year.

Capital One SavorOne - I was leaning towards this until I saw that I rarely spend at places counted in the ""entertainment"" category. 4% on dining is appealing but I wonder how much I would have to spend for more rewards than 1.5% on everything. 

Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards - offers 1.5% cash back on all purchases so I could earn no matter where I spend.

Finally I said I'd give him the info if he answered one question and I asked him how he could live with himself knowing he's hurting people.

fsivff,deepmind411,In mounds of debt. Any assistance is greatly appreciated.,"Hello All,

Throwaway because i'm embarrassed. 27 years old here. I'm in some debt and would like some assistance in figuring out what to do. Made some very bad financial decisions when I was younger. I recently started a new job that allows me to net $3000/month after tax but I haven't had it long enough to have any savings. Along with that I work a side job that I make $1000 a month so i'm working 7 days a week.

Before It was manageable but recently I took on $8000 tacked on to my credit card for lawyer fees and started having to pay $1,200 in child support/ month. I know i'm in a very bad spot currently but any financial help is greatly wanted. 

I can make an extra $800 by stopping my 401k and stock savings plan my company allows but i'm not sure if stopping my 401k is a good idea. I'm at the minimum needed for my company to match. 

One silver lining in all of this is i'm paid up until May in most of my bills &amp; If we get the 1.2k check from the government that would be nice.

* I have sinking funds being funded each month aleady.  Funds are new car, home maintenance , vacation, dog care , vehicle expenses , clothing, life insurance, car insurance, property taxes , HOA, Gift, and home improvement

fsiiqo,Lazurians,Low expense ratio 401k vs IRA,"I currently invest a decent amount over my employer match into a 401k.  I have been giving consideration to putting that extra money into a Roth IRA.

My 401k is through Fidelity and I am currently investing in the Vanguard target retirement 2050 Trust select fund.  The expense ratio for this account is 0.05% which seems pretty low compared to some of the accounts that I have looked at online.

One of the big benefits of an IRA that I was reading about was the reduced expense ratios.  In my situation do you believe it would still be better to open an IRA?

I would likely put the IRA money into a target retirement fund similar to the fidelity account, unless at some point I feel more comfortable selecting some other form of mutual fund.

If I do open an IRA should I open it with someone other then Fidelity to at least give myself the illusion of diversification?

We talked to a second financial advisor this week that told us that Roth IRAs might not make sense for us at all since we might hit that income threshold in the next 3-4 years, which means we wouldn't be able to contribute anymore and those investments wouldn't be compounding in the same way as when you're actively contributing.

I kind of still like the idea of doing it anyway...

I'm not saying everyone should rush out and get life insurance, but if your death would create a financial hardship on anyone then please make sure you take care of this before it's too late.",24,1585679687,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsif7p/if_you_need_life_insurance_move_quickly/,personalfinance,11
fsif66,redditthrowaway331,"Parents want to deed timeshare over to my sister and I, and for us to decide how we split it. How should I consider the value of the timeshare?","My parents bought a timeshare many years ago.  It is paid off, AFAIK, and now they just pay annual fees and dues that amount to just under $1,000/yr.

My immediate reaction was that they're just trying to foist this on us and avoid paying the fees due next month (which is 100% the case) and I should just tell them not interested and not have to deal with it.

However, now I'm wondering about how I can monetize it and extract some value from it even if I don't want to actually use it.  I have a lot of questions and would appreciate a sanity check, too.

&amp;#x200B;

How should I be thinking about this?  What are some options for renting or selling it?  How can I determine its value?  How should my sister and I approach the agreement to protect us and get value out of it?  I know that last question crosses into different territory and I was considering consulting an attorney to make sure we can do it all with the involvement of someone that'll think of the things we don't.

Here’s a little backstory. I worked for a company from August 19 to January 20 and have over 900 hours. The reason i stopped working was that my father got sick and had serious liver damage so i had to leave the country to go see him. Company allowed me a month’s time but i had to spend more time there so i had to quit. I spent nearly 50 days overseas. Got back at the end of february and got sick when landed. So with all the fuzz around i stayed home and kept safe. 
Last day worked was 9th January. I got my ROE that says reason quit on it. Applied for EI on March 13, mentioned that i had quit through no fault of my own and put in the reason that father was sick and had to go see him in case anything happens.

fsi606,tiggertom66,My financial situation has greatly improved. What to do?,"I work in retail and my store is considered essential because we work in telecommunications and IT. I've been working more hours. My usual pay check is ~$500 but recently it's been $750. This is bi weekly.

With the stock market so low right now I'd like to get into it so when this is all over and it goes back up, I can go up with it.

I also have a limited credit history, but never miss payments.

My score tends to plummet sometimes over 100 points when my credit usage is recorded at the wrong time.

I use my Discover credit card for gas, and at the drive through because it earns me 2% cash back that gets matched after a year. I treat my Discover like a pass through for my checking account. I pay everything off right away, but it takes time for the money to move.

The limit is only $200 and it's a secured card so if I want to increase that limit, Id have to increase my deposit. It also has a dangerously high interest rate of 27.99% so if I ever carry a balance it would be a heavy hit.

If I fill up my gas tank and get lunch and I'm over 30% usage.

I bought a computer part from work with my card and paid it off right away but my usage was recorded during the time kn between and so my score dropped from a 640 to a 570. Now my card is payed off entirely and it's up to 693.

My score goes up overall, but these periodic dips are concerning.

I recieved a letter from PenFed Credit Union offering me a card with a 0% balance transfer for 12 months, and a variable interest rate of 8.25% to 14.75% which even at the highest rate is considerably lower than my current card.

Should I apply for this new card? And what should I do about my Discover card?

fsi2km,lesleypowers,"My wife and I want to buy our first house in the next couple of years, but I will have to pay the majority of the deposit. What’s the best way to go about this fairly?","Hey all! So here’s our situation: my wife and I currently earn around the same amount of money and are both debt free, however she used the majority of her savings to pay off her masters degree in early 2019. We are planning on moving out of state when she attends medical school next year and buying our first house in the area. We estimate by this time I’ll have about $40k saved for a deposit, and she’ll have around $10k. I have pretty crappy credit (691) but hers is excellent (over 800). Neither of us are from wealthy families, any property our families own is inherited, and we don’t really know what the usual way to go about this is. She is anxious about being ‘in debt’ to me (not that I would see it that way or hold it over her or anything like that) so I’m thinking some kind of percentage of equity would be the right way to do it? I will also add that once she graduates she will most likely be earning over twice as much as me, probably for the duration of our careers, and at that point we will readjust our division of finances. 

Would love any advice you can give as my wife is so concerned about this being “unfair” on me that she’s started to think we should not buy a house and keep renting until we can split the deposit 50/50, which won’t be for at least 6+ years. I think that’s a bad financial decision as the area we are moving to is very affordable now, but rapidly growing and house prices have already increased substantially in the last few years. On top of that owning a home together is a huge ambition for us both, we put so much love and time into just our rental and spend hours window shopping on Zillow together. It’s a massive priority for us both and I want to give her peace of mind so we can go ahead with it.",46,1585678596,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsi2km/my_wife_and_i_want_to_buy_our_first_house_in_the/,personalfinance,0

I am scrambling to help my family navigate through this as he doesn't have health insurance (had but canceled due to financial reasons). What are the options for my dad/family?

* Both my parents were laid off.
* He is looking into insurance plans, they are costly but I think our family/friends can manage the monthly payment.

He's had a heart attack five years ago and had surgery (stent). He was a smoker but quit cold turkey after the incident.
* He is 61 (Asian) -- has been in the US for almost 35 years. He is not a U.S Citizen yet (currently in the works) and had has his green card since he immigrated here. L

fshhhj,FCCDEBT,Cash out Refi - CC Debt,"Hello All - this is a throwaway account fyi.  I'm very embarrassed of my debt situation, and looking to make a move to alleviate the stress involved with CC Debt.  The debt has been carried for many, many years and I've used 0% transfers for the most part to try and control it. 

My situation:

40 years old - Roughly $80-$85K/per year  with great benefits, 401k (7%), and pension.  Fiancee makes $65k and pays the bills and makes monthly Credit Card payments.

House has $165k, with 25 years left on a 4.25% 30 year. When the house was purchased it was appraised at $223k, in todays market it would easily be $250k (conservative estimate).  Monthly payment is $1800.

CC Debt - Roughly $25k (but this includes myself and fiancee).  

Student Loan - $35k make $600/month payments

No car debt.

I'd like to do a cash out refi possibly, and have contacted quicken loans.  

My dilemma is should I do15/20/30 year refi.  

Plan would be Cash out refi $25k, to pay off CC debt.  This would free up a combined rough $1k/month in cc payments.  I'd really like to go from a 25 year remaining mortgage to a 15 or 20 year mortgage with a lower interest rate.  The problem is the cost of the new refi is about $7k, rolled into the new mortgage.  I'm hesitant because it makes me think I have to pay $7k to access my $25k cash out.  Does this make sense?  Should I just get a Heloc?

Some other caveats, we live in NJ and are seriously looking at moving to Florida.  I have applied to a few positions, but  my current position is pretty great so I'm hesitant to take ""any"" job out there.  The fiancee works in an industry, where she could move tomorrow.  With CoronaVirus, there is a possibility my job will start being more aggressive with remote work.  Does this matter much, when looking at doing a refi?  Are there Refis that have no cost, or is there a barometer to gauge if I'm being charged accurately, such as a percentage of the loan?

Our goal is to get out of CC debt, but it never seems like we can get over the hump.  I know spending is a concern, and we are doing our best to control it.  The only CC transactions at this point are for vacations.  

Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.  I feel like the debt just weighs me down, and even though I have a pretty good job, it's very hard to enjoy the fruits when I have this constant CC debt in my head.",7,1585676776,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fshhhj/cash_out_refi_cc_debt/,personalfinance,1

fshb8l,sammy4427,Got my first Chase credit card. Except apparently I already had an account with them and I think my identity might have been stolen?,"Hi. I'm worried so I would appreciate any feedback I could get.

I'm 19 years old and I keep a very close eye on my financial accounts. Last week I applied for and was approved for a Chase Freedom Unlimited, and before that, the only credit card I'd had was a Discover It Student. I have multiple checking/savings accounts with Ally, and another checking account with my local credit union. I also have a chunk of money invested through Charles Schwab. Besides that, that's it. I have never opened another credit/checking/savings/anything account with any other institution, and I DEFINITELY have never had an account with Chase before this.

Yesterday I received my new Chase card in the mail and went to finally enroll for an account. However, it was telling me I already had an account with them with a username I didn't recognize. Even more oddly, it's a username I have never chosen for literally anything in my life. It's my first and middle initials, followed by the two digits of my birthday, followed by the first four letters of my last name. I thought it was odd but maybe it was just the default Chase set up until you changed it or something. But when I went to reset/create a password, the partially concealed email and phone number it was giving me the option to send a temporary code to weren't mine. I tried them anyway and it didn't send me the code, so at that point, I knew it couldn't be a placeholder for my real phone number and email.

I still didn't really think anything was wrong though. I've spent about 4 hours on the phone with Chase at this point just trying to access ""my"" account, as I can't create another since it's tied to my social, and finally, I've been able to get in. However, it turns out that I supposedly have a Sapphire checking account with them with a balance of $0 that has never had any transaction on it, and the address listed under my account is the address to a place advertising clearing up your debt. Now I'm very concerned.

I just got off the phone with Chase. They told me the account was created in February of this year, but again, I did not open that account. I am more than 100% sure of that. They told me I have to go into a branch to get that resolved but due to the Coronavirus situation, we are under quarantine and aren't supposed to leave our homes. I'm just very concerned about my identity at this point. 

I have never had a fraudulent transaction on my account or seen any suspicious activity whatsoever. I checked my credit report at the beginning of this month and did not see any incorrect information whatsoever. My credit score is also fine. There is nothing suspicious whatsoever anywhere that I can think to look. I am just not sure what to do at this point.

I am going to go to a Chase branch as soon as I can to see what I can do. The only information I have regarding this at the moment is that the account was opened in February of this year, as well as the last 4 digits of the phone number it was originally associated with and the address of this debt clearing place.

I'm also remembering now that maybe a month or two ago I received a call from a debt collection agency telling me that I owed a sum of money, but I told them clearly it was not me because I'm only 19 and the age of the debt is longer than the time that I've been a legal adult. I thought it was a mistake, but now I'm wondering if it has anything to do with this.

Please, if you have any experience with this or any advice as to what I should do, let me know. I have no idea what to do at this point but I do believe something is wrong here.

fshaxw,sonoflee,Mortgage refinance - is it worth it in my situation?,"Looking for a quick sanity check - I've been meaning to refinance for a while now, but looking at options.  My goal is to keep monthly around the same or slightly increased, but reduce interest rate/pay off faster.

Principal balance is $97000

I'm a little leery of increasing that minimum payment with the economy as crazy as it is, so I am going to see if they'll go for the same rate or 3% on a 15 year, and I can continue paying extra principal as I have been.

My wife \[f27\] and I \[m25\] have been looking at our finances due to the looming economic situation. My job has recently been heavily impacted as I'm a recruiter and companies are using their in-house resources rather than pay my fees. We subsequently slashed every single extra expense possible, to the point that we gave up our apartment and are living with her dad.

fsh3a5,throwawayburner86,Not financially Savvy. Need advice!,"I [26F] am not finance savvy. I never grew up learning about finances and knowing how to manage or save. I grew up in a lower-middle class home with a single parent. I joined the military at 18, finally making money for myself. And the first few years, it was all about me. I didn’t have many bills so I would always send money home. And buy what I wanted, because I couldn’t always have what I wanted, growing up. I would also save money, but then use it up. I would get personal loans as a method of building credit (still not finance savvy) and pay them off quickly/before it’s due. But, I live pay check to pay check. I’m not proud of that.

It’s taken me THIS long (still in the military) at 26, to sit back and say, “hey. I need to start saving, especially because I have less than a year left in and I am now married”. My ultimate goal is to be comfortable and to be able to save money. My husband and I are also talking about potentially buying a home within the next 5 years. But I know I need to be more self disciplined.

As I stated, I’ve never been financially smart, or savvy. I never really had anyone to ask or to talk to about it or to consult when making financial moves. I never really knew how to do the research. I knew nothing about credit then, and the only thing I know now is that I need to keep my score up by paying off things on time or early. 

So my dilemma lies with credit card (cash rewards) debt. I’m a little over $8k in CC Debt. And I need help on what I can do to pay it off quickly. My APR is 18%. (Again, I don’t even know about any of that). Any time I try to pay on it, over the minimum payment, it’s overshadowed by the interest. I have asked my bank about the SCRA, but I’m in the review window. Not only that, but my limit keeps increasing. And honestly it’s stressful. I’m aware that I, myself let my CC debt get this bad and I’m aware of how irresponsible I’ve been when it comes to this but I really would like to just pay off this debt so that I can breathe. 

Is there any advice anyone can give me? Or point me in a direction? TIA.",18,1585675517,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsh3a5/not_financially_savvy_need_advice/,personalfinance,1

fsh0vt,mseanmiller1,Help with broker making unauthorized trades,"Good morning,

&amp;#x200B;

I have several accounts (managed, un-managed, savings, rollover IRA, ROTH etc) with a broker in Bellevue, WA. On SUnday March 8th I left a voicemail to align all securities in all accounts until further notice to one of my bond like fund account. I sent a follow-up email on Monday morning the 9th.

&amp;#x200B;

My fiduciary broker gave me a call later in the day to verify my request. (I was told on the voicemail that no trades can be made via voicemail and or email I believe).

&amp;#x200B;

During the course of the call I was under the understanding that instead of Matching my bond fund account that we sell everything to cash.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at my accounts on the 11th and noticed that all of my managed accounts had been sold to cash as expected but they didn't sell off my non-managed accounts yet. I was told it could take a day or two to sell so many accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

I got busy and didn't get a chance to address the non-managed accounts that didn't get sold. On Saturday, 3/21, I noticed that my broker had started to purchase the same or similar security mix starting on 3/18 through 3/20 without my permission. Over the course of of those purchases the funds lost value substantially. 

&amp;#x200B;

I called my broker over the weekend and he answered the call to my surprise. I asked him why did they start making purchases since I hadn't authorized anything at that point. He stated that it was a mistake and that the accounts would be reset back to the fund values on March the 9th. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday, 3/23 they sold ALL accounts to cash finally, but now they still haven't made my accounts whole as of 3/9. They are stating that they are going to base my 3/9 cost basis on the original bond fund account which is much lower in value. I believe I told them to go to cash on 3/9 even though my email and voicemail stated something differently. I believe their actions on Monday 3/9 of selling all my managed accounts to cash which included my bond fund account shows exactly what our conversation entailed on 3/9 otherwise why sell everything to cash first and wait 10+ days to start buying a mix of securities(apple, ebay, costco etc) and bond funds.

24yrs, Oregon, US here. 

I’m in the running for a pretty rad job where I’d be much happier than my current workplace.

The wage is about the same, but I would be brought on as a full-time, self-employed consultant rather than an employee.

I’d be responsible for my own taxes. This would be my first time doing that full-time, so I’m a little worried I’d end up making significantly less. Am I crazy? 

The benefits work out fine - stipend for insurance, plenty of PTO. 

No 401(k), which is a bummer because my current employer matches. I could open my own retirement account. I can see myself here for a few years, but not a lifetime - so maybe a few years without a match is okay. 


I’d be writing full time (well-funded tech company wants someone to work on their online presence) and would get the experience I need to get a full-time writing gig at a company with a better benefit situation.

fsgxxz,ESPPthrowaway0331,ELI5. What should I do about my ESPP now that my company stock has tanked?,"Hello all! I created a throwaway for this as I work for a very large company, and no doubt my coworkers will see this.

In fact, I work for a major airline in the US, so the stock in question is a volatile one.

I participate in our employee stock purchase program. The time in question is from November of 2019 until April 30th, 2020. So, we're getting ready to take the money that's been set aside and purchase the stock at a 15% discount. However, the union has emailed us to let us know that because the stock has tanked, and because of IRS limits, it may be advisable to withdrawl the money and start again fresh on May 1st. 

Could someone ELI5 and help me decide what to do? I have about $6000 in there now, would add around $1400 in April, bringing my total for this period to $7400ish. In the past, I've sold off the stocks right away and taken my 15% increase. I need this money again this period because I've just purchased a house and I was planning to use this money to aid my downpayment. Here's some highlights from the email from the union.

&gt; At the beginning of each offering period, in this case on November 1, 2019, a snapshot is taken to determine how much stock can be acquired at the end of the period. The [stock] closing price on that date was $1X.48, and so the stock was valued at that price for purposes of determining the IRS limit.

&gt;Participants have a $25,000 annual limit on how much stock can by acquired under an CSPP, plus whatever carryover amount they have from the previous year. For most ongoing participants, this carryover is just a few dollars, but it can be much higher if they're a new participant or if there's a sharp run-up in price. For the sake of this discussion, we'll assume that your IRS limit is exactly $25,000.

&gt;The IRS limit caps the number of shares you can buy based on the price at the snapshot, not the price on the date of purchase. Therefore, you can divide your remaining eligibility, $25,000, by the starting stock price, $1X.48. This means you can buy a maximum of 1,283 shares at the end of the offering period on April 30, 2020.

&gt;Since the stock price snapshot was taken on November 1, 2019, [My company]'s stock price has dropped significantly. If the price remains suppressed on April 30, the IRS limit—not the money you saved—could be the limiting factor for determining how much stock you can buy. If this happens, not only would you have money left over after the purchase, but you would  also be ineligible to participate in the next offering period. Remember, the IRS limit is an annual limit.

&gt;Even if you don't use all of your funds, your eligibility to purchase shares for the next offering period would be reduced more than you expect, since the reduction in eligibility is tied to the snapshot price, not the purchase price.

Given the circumstances, what would be my best option going forward?",6,1585675050,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsgxxz/eli5_what_should_i_do_about_my_espp_now_that_my/,personalfinance,1

Makes sense since I remember seeing that happen before during the summer of last year where the Fed's made interest rate cuts and HYSA's interest rates followed suite (i.e. going from say \~2.0% to \~1.7%).

If that's the case, will HYSAs drop their interest rates to near 0% in the coming months? Which basically would defeat the purpose of keeping money in there while earning interest to stay close to inflation.

fsggu2,stacyyines,Can’t Make Your Car Payment?,"It’s going to be a financial nightmare for many people soon or maybe is already.

I just wanted to share some tips as a former collections person (who once repo’d cars 😳) if you might soon be or already are unable to make your car payment.

1. DO NOT IGNORE CALLS OR HANG UP ON THE LENDER IF THEY’RE CALLING FOR PAYMENT.
Most lenders now have software programs that document every individual account interaction or attempts of contact. 
If you’re hanging up on them- you’re showing you’re uncooperative. If you have ZERO communication with your lender - the lender will likely result to repo’ing the vehicle sooner. If you are hanging up on the person assigned to collect payment- they will more than likely repo the vehicle sooner than they normally would. 

2. TALK TO THE LENDER DAYS BEFORE YOU KNOW WILL BE PAST DUE.
Why? Some lenders might have a ‘DUE DATE CHANGE’ option. Many of them do not offer this option if the account is already past due. Ask the customer service representative the furthest date you can push your payment to. 
(Please be advised that if you have a simple interest contract - you will be paying those additional days of interest because you extended your contract mature date. That is unless you payoff early or refinance your loan.)

3. MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS. 
If you’re actively trying to make payments - it shows cooperation. Collectors are more likely to work with you if you’re trying. Especially if you’re making payments little by little. You may still be subject to a late charge if the payment is not paid in full if stipulated on your purchase contract. 
Also, if the full payment amount is not paid and received by the lender within the 30 days of your due date - it might also ding your credit. (Be mindful of the payment method you use. Some payment methods take days to post or be received. So if you mail a check on day 27 - it might take over a week to be received and cleared. By the time it’s been processed- you’re over 30 days past due.)

4. ASK FOR AN EXTENSION.
Some lenders will allow you another month to make your payment by extending your contract. Why use that as a last resort? Some only allow 1 EXTENSION for the life of the loan. So if you really need it - you might not have this option again. You also extend another month of interest by doing this if you have a simple interest contract. (Lenders may require proof of hardship to grant an extension.)

5. HAVE GOOD CREDIT? TRY REFINANCING.
If your credit has improved from your time of purchase - you might qualify to refinance at a lower rate and lower payment. When you refinance - the new lender payoffs your old loan and contracts you with a payment due date 30 days from your new refinance contract date. 

UNABLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REP OVER THE PHONE?
Check the lender‘s website. 
Some now offer the Due Date Change option online or email them. 

I hope these tips help during this difficult time. 

Please contact your lender to verify which options you have available.

fsgbwj,a_Dolphinnn,Which funds to invest in Traditional IRA vs Roth IRA?," 

Hello,

I had a 401k with a previous employer that I rolled over into a traditional IRA with Fidelity. I was investing in FDKVX and FXAIX. I learned about the tax implications for a Traditional vs Roth and given the fact that I am 25 years old, I decided to open up a Roth with fidelity as well.

I just threw in $500 to contribute to the Roth IRA and purchased $400 FZROX and $100 FZILX. I then sold all my shares of FDKVX and used them to fully invest in FXAIX for my Traditional IRA.

So I am currently investing 100% of $6,000 into FXAIX with my Traditional IRA and 80% FZROX / 20% FZILX into my Roth IRA. I plan on only contributing to the Roth IRA for the foreseeable future ($100-200 monthly).

Does it make sense to only be investing in the indexes between these two accounts? Should I assume more risk with one in comparison to the other? I am very new to all of this and would like to take advantage of buying while the markets been low.

Thanks in advance!",13,1585673109,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsgbwj/which_funds_to_invest_in_traditional_ira_vs_roth/,personalfinance,1

fsgas0,MidsizedSedan,ISO Tax Help for Americorp Member,"I was an AmeriCorps service member for all of 2019 and I have a couple questions about how I should file my various non-standard incomes (outside of my living allowance, which I have a W2 for). I'm using the free version of Turbo Tax and so far it's telling me I owe about $1200 in state and federal taxes, which could totally be accurate (AC members don't pay state taxes upfront), but I want to clarify a couple things before I click submit:

* My host site provided me with $350 worth of gift cards each month of 2019 to help with my living costs (groceries and public transportation mainly). I didn't receive any tax documents for this income, but I know the organization is reporting it because it came out of a specific budget. The only place I can see where it would make sense to report this is in a 1099-MISC, but Turbo Tax is treating it like self-employment, which doesn't seem right to me.

* I received a student loan interest payment disbursement from the Corporation for National and Community Service and was provided another 1099-MISC for it. The same question applies: why is Turbo Tax treating this like self-employment?
The last form I'm filing is a 1098-E for interest I paid to my student loans in 2019 (not a question, just FYI).

* Any advice or recommendations would be SO appreciated.
I just need some clarity to feel better about submitting a return thats going to end up costing me $1200 and all of the free community tax resources in my area are closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

fsgarc,caoboi025,Inherited a house and I’m a bit lost,"I’m 27. I recently inherited a house from my grandma that’s worth 250k USD and I’m a bit lost. I have a high income job (in SEA region). But I cant stand working a 9-5 job. I’ve been jumping from firms to firms and it’s really tiring. I cant do this anymore. I live alone, no gf and not planning to get married, zero debt. I have my own apartment.

I’m thinking about quitting my current job and working at some coffee shop, then using the given money to open my own shop when I have enough of experience. But it’s risky since if the coffee thing failed ( probably 4-5 years later), it’d be too late for me to go back to my current working profession, not to mention the loss I’d have to bear afterwards. It might take 25k-50k to start with the shop. 

The saving interest here is up to 8% annually. Bonds’ are around 9-11%. 

Could you guys give me some recommendations on this? Should I pursue doing something like the coffee shop or find something else safer to do? Should I invest into something? What should I do to not throw 250k out of the window?

I know the benefit in a traditional IRA is that you can contribute up to 5.5k annually without it being taxed.

I was wondering, if i want to contribute more towards my retirement, is there any benefits to having a roth ira in addition to my traditional ira or no?

Question regarding expense ratios.  I started a couple months ago at a new company.  I was very excited because I got a raise and I'm finally financially able to max out my 401k this year.  I set my contributions based on the 100 - age rule and haven't looked back since.  

I was looking today though and noticed that all of the available funds have expense ratios that seem sky high.  Like between 1.25%-1.75%.  When I chose funds I of course picked the ones with the lowest expense ratios, but for some reason it didn't really register.  I also picked 1/3 trad 401k, 2/3 roth 401k

This got me thinking, if I stay with this company for a while, and they stick with this broker, I'm going to be paying out the ass, after 15 years, I'll have paid more than the 20% I would have paid on capital gains.  

Would it be better to just put the minimum amount required to get full match and then put the rest into a taxable brokerage? I already max out my personal roth every year.

I purchased a home last year. When it was time for me to sign I noticed the mortgage payment wasn’t the same as I thought it was going to be.  $2200 vs $2000.  So I questioned it.  My mortgage broker told me it was due to taxes and I would have to file homestead exemption,  I tried to reach out and was told that since I filed it at my old location I didn’t need to file it again until the following year.  When I told my broker this he rewrote everything to sign basically at the $2000

I thought everything was good until this year during a reassessment of my escrow. Come to find out my escrow paid for $2000 of the $4000 taxes I owe,  so not only do I owe that back, but now my escrow payments are higher as well.  This is a very difficult time for this to happen considering this virus has put a damper on my sales at work.

What options do I have here?  I’m not sure why my taxes are even where they are. I filed homestead exemption and it was approved. Yet my taxes are $1000-$1500 more than my neighbors.

What online service did I use to file my taxes? Good question, I have no idea. I know it is ridiculous that I have zero recollection of what service I used, but I really do not. 

Before filing, I saw a reddit thread about doing your taxes for free, and followed that, which I'm pretty sure just took me to the IRS website where they have a list of free tools. I imagine I used one of those. I remember that I used TurboTax to check that I got the same numbers, but I did not file through TurboTax (I still get lots of emails from them begging me to finish). I don't remember why, but I ended up needing to pay $18.90 to this service, and I *can* see that charge on my bank account. There, it's listed as this: FREE TAX RETURNS DES:FREETAXRTN, Which is pretty vague. I can't find any confirmation email from them. I've tried the ""check my refund status"" tool on the IRS website and it hasn't turned up anything. I've tried calling IRS but there is no live help until further notice, I imagine because of the pandemic.

I scared I was scammed and filed my taxes through some fake website, like the giant idiot I am. I am sure I made some glaring mistake and trust me, I feel really stupid.

Ive tried calling four times now, each time I either get automatically told the live systems are down and will be up eventually, or they can't process my request at the moment and to call back later. So if I can't contact the IRS, and apparently owe money, what exactly am I to do in this situation? I can't afford to even pay them if I wanted to and figure out later, but apparently the amounts due next month so I'm lost and would appreciate advice.",16,1585668896,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsf0zo/got_a_proposed_amount_due_bill_about_my_2018_tax/,personalfinance,7

fsezip,RetiredSMSgt,5 Year review of Champion / New Image Modular Home,"  

Here is my 5 year review of buying, building and living in a Champion New Image Modular Home.

I ordered a New Image 3 bed 2 bath home in 2014. A simple single story house on a basement. Paid $20k to have a septic mound installed and another $20k for a full basement and $15k for excavation work. 

The set of the house went easy with a crane setting the house. After that I realized these houses aren’t all they are claimed to be.

Entering the house the wiring was hanging in the basement. I had to hire an electrician to finish the fuse panel box and get that inspected.

The supply line plumbing in the house was not quality controlled. Every single piece of plumbing done by Champion wasn’t tight. The drywall had to be cut the get into the connections and do what should have been done in the factory. The J-traps under the sinks were all loose. So in a new house I have ruined wood under all the cabinets due to waste water leaking.

There is no central connection to hook the supply water to. You have to pay a plumber to hook every supply line up and pay to hook every waste water line up to a central line.

Next pleasure, these are built with particle board baseboard, so in every bathroom and where your dog drinks water the baseboard comes apart.

I opted for electric baseboard heaters since these are supposed to be insulated really well. They are not. It cost over $500 a month heat this place. 

Piggybacking on the insulation – The walls don’t seem very insulated. Every time a vehicle drives past I mine as well have to doors and windows open. This place is loud.  The quality of life inside is horrible due to hearing every sound outside.  The doors and windows don’t stop any sound. The weather strip around the door isn’t even solid. I’ve had to piece it together to stop the noise, bugs and heat loss.

Speaking of windows, particle board again around the windows. So if your window is open and it rains – ruined particle board.

The structure isn’t quite there either. The floors squeak when you walk across the floors. I’ve shimmed till my heart’s content but it seams another always starts. When you run the washer, the rinse cycle shakes the entire back half of the house. The sliding glass door literally vibrates. The washer isn’t out of balance. Just this house seems to have little structure integrity. The back wall where the guest bathroom is warped. It will take tearing the siding off the figure out what is going on behind it. Literally looks like a wave running down the wall.

The siding is also junk. I’ve had to reattach this stuff every spring. It seems the factory wanted save money and didn’t put any overlay in. In the winter it shrinks and you can see the weather wrap underneath. That leads to it unsnapping from itself and me getting a ladder out and trying to reattach it. It has also faded. I had to replace two pieces (I have original siding) and the color difference is huge.

The exhaust vent from the kitchen wasn’t installed correctly. It vented right into the attic. It’s been fixed but now there are mold marks where the damage was done. The bathroom vents weren’t insulated either so the water would condensate. It damaged the insulation in the attic and it would literally pour condensation from the fan onto the bathroom floors.

I wish I could say these houses are the way to go but I feel like I bought a 100 year old fixer upper rather than a brand new house. So that’s my review. Hope it helps you in your decision on buying a new modular from Champion Home Builders / New Era Building systems.",64,1585668757,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsezip/5_year_review_of_champion_new_image_modular_home/,personalfinance,27

I had dental insurance through my old employer, which lapsed in January, so I already went to the dentist for my checkup/cleaning in 2020. My new job is offering me dental insurance for $4.24 per paycheck (biweekly) for free preventive, 80% basic, 50% major, and a $1000 max benefit. My old employer's dental was $1500 max, which was nice.

However, so far, my teeth is healthy; no cavities or root canal work needed, and as long as I take care of my teeth, I should be okay. Early/mid-30s here. I might take the insurance for peace of mind in case something happens, but a $1k max benefit seems pretty low.

fses03,SirPandaEsq,Just want to take a moment to shout out my awesome company during this time.,"I work for TD Bank AMCB, and I have to applaud the way they are committing to their employees and their customers at this time. I know many of my friends are unemployed right now, and I am one of the few to still have a job. I should be thankful enough to just have a paycheck right now, but TD has gone so far and beyond that. We went to drive through only service at the start of the month, and changed our usually long hours to 9:30-4. We also allow customers to come in to the lobby by appointment, and we were obviously given hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes to use constantly. We also have evolved into A and B teams, so Team A will work Monday-Wed, and Team B will work Thurs-Sat. That way if one person gets the virus, the entire team is not at risk. 

Obviously shorter hours and only working 3 days a week would be rough. I usually work between 40-45 hours a week, but since I am Team B, I am now only working 19 hours! But TD is paying us the difference, our full 40 regardless of hours actually worked. They are also paying us an additional $500 for every month we need to work in hazardous conditions since we are essential employees. They are also eliminating all sales goals that we usually need to meet, but are still going to pay us our quarterly sales bonuses. They also announced that there will not be a single layoff this year for the virus, so our jobs are safe, which worried many due to the much lower volume we have seen. Even though I am a banker and do not have to deal with people face to face, I have been on the phone for hours every day waiving fees for customers and lowering rates and freezing payments. If any of you are impacted at this time, go to your bank and tell them. If they are like mine, they will waive all fees during this time, and defer mortgage, loan, and credit card payments! Well that is all I wanted to say, I am just happy to feel like a company actually cares about their employees, as I have worked at many places where that was not the case.",58,1585668072,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fses03/just_want_to_take_a_moment_to_shout_out_my/,personalfinance,192

Given that we most likely won't purchase a home before our lease ends, we were hoping to go month-to-month even if it means paying slightly more.  However, the landlord came back and said they will not do month-to-month leases.  Furthermore, they'll need an answer for whether we plan on renewing our lease in the next couple days (90-day notice).  Any recommendations for the situation we currently find ourselves in?  I feel as if the landlord is basically forcing our hand by making us renew for a full year since we don't have the option to view new apartments in the forseeable future and not to mention, we plan on purchasing a home once the market somewhat stabilizes.

fseckz,ohaitharr,[US] Financing through repair company or personal loan?,"Hello,

My friends AC unit needs replaced and unfortunately she can't go much longer without it as we live in Arizona and it's already been in the 80's. 

She's in a situation where she would need to finance the purchase ($8k), however doesn't want to utilizing savings at this time.. however projects she can have it paid off in a year. 

The repair company is offering her a financing plan with a 8.9% interest rate. She has good credit and has no debt. 

Given the current economic situation, would a personal loan offer her better interest rates than 9%? I thought I had heard interest rates went down a lot recently. 

Side question: The repair company did a hard inquiry on her credit. If she decided to shop around for a personal loan, would these personal loan inquiries lump into the same hard inquiry as the repair companies check?

Edit: so it looks like the repair company used a bank to finance the loan; EnerBank USA. So I guess my question is.. is 9% high for a personal loan right now?

Husband went. They said he needed x-rays and CT scans and blood work. The diagnosis? Flu.

fse0xc,rasmitas,Student Loan for UK loan in Canada,"My fiance has moved to Canada with me and she's from the UK. A telemarketer called her and made a business course seem very beneficial so she decided to try the 18 month online course. From the start it was very sketchy and she didn't meet anybody in person. After the first lesson she knew the course was not for her and emailed her tutor to withdraw. The tutor kept encouraging her to continue and basically didn't accept that she was withdrawing. There was a grace period where students can withdraw which is why she informed her tutor within the first week of the course. The tutor simply never accepted the withdraw and kept encouraging her. Then the grace period was over and they handed her loan over to the UK student loan.

She has several emails of the wild goose chase they had her attempt to withdraw. She also lives in Canada now (for past 3 years). She's really concerned and upset about this loan hanging over her head for a course she never took. The UK student loan people keep pestering her for payments and/or information to update her profile. They have her trapped in this horrible cycle of UK student loan needing proof from school and school shrugging it off saying they didn't get notification, despite lots of evidence saying the contrary.

Is there anything we can do at this point? Will there be any legal ramifications if we just ignore the requests of the UK student loan people being in Canada?

fsdxoo,medicalwoes2020,Wait out insurance or call ER physician billing directly?,"I have a question about medical bills/collections/insurance. 

TLDR: do I keep waiting on insurance to do their thing or negotiate with the billing department myself?

So, I went to the ER a couple months ago. (Had intense abdominal pain. Apparently I’m fine) My medical insurance has a $0 deductible. $250 copay for ER visits. I went to a hospital that was listed as in network. Paid my $250 copay and thought that was the end of it. 

Well, I got a letter in the mail from the ER physician billing dept saying they saw me out of network and my insurance only paid ~$300 of an $1800 charge. But they stated on this letter that this was not a bill. I never knew specific doctors in hospitals could be out of network. Lesson learned. 

Anyway, called my insurance and they said don’t worry about it unless they send you an actual bill. I got another letter a couple weeks ago from the ER physician that said basically “we’re going to send you a bill if you don’t tell your insurance to renegotiate this with us”

I called my insurance and they said we’re not going to renegotiate anything unless they send you an actual bill. They were given our information to call anyway. 

So now I’m just in limbo. It’s been about 60 days since my date of service and I’m just waiting on a bill to show up? I *could* pay the remaining $1500 but it would drain my savings. I’m worried I’m going to be sent to collections because it’s been so long since service was provided. How long would the renegotiating take once I receive a bill? Should I just call the ER doc and tell them hey my insurance is going to pay more but you have to send me a bill first? Do I just ask them to lower my bill because I went expecting to not have to pay anything but my copay and it wasn’t my choice to see someone out of network? 

I don’t like this waiting game. I have good credit and I don’t want a collection to happen to tank that when I have the money and insurance is just obnoxious and complicated.

fsdrea,inkysquares,Is this the best way to maximize the 6 month student loan freeze?,"So I'm in a normal repayment plan and don't expect that I will lose any income or have any financial changes in the next 6 months. I want to optimize this money over the next 6 months. I currently have multiple small loans all with varying interest rates. Here's my game plan:

* Stop making payments on all eligible loans for the next 6 months. In my case, all loans held by my servicer have automatically been placed in a 6 month forbearance period with 0% interest. 
* Place all of those payments into my HYSA. This will allow that money to gain some interest over the 6 month period while also giving me extra emergency savings should I need it.
* Just before the 6 month period ends on Sept. 30th, take the money back from my HYSA and apply that towards the capital of my highest interest rate loans. This will make the biggest long term dent on my loans.

Are there any steps that could optimize this even more, or does anyone see any issues with this financial plan?",7,1585664551,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsdrea/is_this_the_best_way_to_maximize_the_6_month/,personalfinance,1
fsdrc9,yogabx,Debt elimination advice,"I’ve been grappling with the order to pay my debt down in, and I’m stuck. We’re at a place where that’s our central focus right now, to get back on track. I’ve already raised my credit score 64 points in the past two months, so I’m really determined to get this right moving forward. Here’s my plan so far:

1. Pay off all credit debt that is in collections or high balances on existing credit cards so I’m using no more than 10% of my limit. I’ve been working toward this for awhile, but in the next couple months, I will be able to settle with the companies and pay a lump sum in full for the two accounts in collections. 

2. Pay off all past neglected bills on my and my husbands credit report and ask the companies to do a pay for delete. (There’s a few, they are mostly small amounts ranging from $60-$200). 

3. Then this is where I’m stuck. Do I funnel all my extra cash into my student loans? (One is federal, and one is private)? They both are current, and I’m making minimum payments monthly. 
OR, do I funnel all my extra cash into the rest of our medical bills which are floating somewhere (not yet on my credit report as delinquent), and I don’t know what the status of them is? 
OR, do I split my extra cash between the two so I’m hitting them both, but not one more aggressively? 

My thoughts are to funnel it all into the student loans, pay them way down, then tackle the rest of our medical debt that’s not in collections. 

Other factors: we also need to save for a second car. I was hoping to do this after step number 2, while working on either the student loans, the medical bills, or a combination of both.

fsdkhz,SexyFicus,I have a secure job and I'm trying to decide rent vs buy for my current scenario. Any advice would be appreciated.,"I'm a potential first time home buyer, and a resident physician about to move. I'm in the process of weighing rent vs buy in my scenario, and if you have any advice I'd appreciate it. Sorry for the long text wall..

I'm moving to a small rural American town with my SO, daughter, and dog.
The rent in this town for a single family home is in the range of 1400-1600 + all utilities. Way high for the cost of living in the surrounding area. These prices have always been high I'm told since the hospital is the main employer of the town and there are many doctors that live there short-term and frequently in and out the town.
However real estate values in-town are typically in the range of 80k-150k.

The rent in a 30min radius around the hospital is in this high range. Outside that is more reasonable costs, but not reasonable driving distance for me since I'm at the hospital frequently and for long times.

The town has a yearly influx and efflux of many resident physicians, typically staying for 3-7 years at a time. So these individuals are usually looking for renting options. I also have inside connection with the hospital, so us physicians and staff have our own private listing pages for rentals &amp; home purchases.

I'm trying to decide if I should just purchase a cheap house while I am here for 3yr, where my mortgage is in the ballpark of 500-700/month. Or if I should just rent. Using the NYT rent vs buy calculator it said if I could find rents less than approx $800 I should rent- lol which does not exist in this town.

I'm already pre-qualified for a mortgage loan, at 3%, with no PMI and no money down.
My salary for the next 3yr will be lower $60k range. After that it will jump into the ballpark of $300k (if I stay in rural areas).

My hospital offered me a contract to continue working with them for another 5yr (after my 3yrs) if I so choose, where they guarantee to start me at $375k salary. 

So with all this information, I'm leaning towards purchasing a house that's approx $95k. 
One because I need somewhere close to the hospital to live that also accommodates my family currently.
Two, estimated rent at 1500/month for 3yrs is $54k. If I'm dropping that much it's practically half the home values here. 
Three(a), if I sign that 5yr contract with my hospital and stay I'll already have a home and I can pay the rest off very quickly at a salary 3x higher than home value. 
Three(b), if I don't stay, I could potentially rent it out to other resident physicians who are always coming to town.

The cons of purchasing would be if I don't stay in this town after 3yrs. I'd likely be moving for a better job prospect. So either I have a tenant paying rent, or it sits empty. Though sitting empty isn't a huge concern since I'll be earning a high salary. BUT it's still an added expense. There's also the wear and tear of tenants but I already have approx 6 months+ of expenses saved up of emergency fund (which would grow over these next 3yr as I add to it and I'm living in the house)

I read a decent book and blog called White Coat Investor which gave reasons not to buy a house, but also said there are certain circumstances where it's recommended. I understand the points they made, but I got the impression they were talking as if I'd buy a home in 200k+ range. Wasn't hugely helpful for my situation with these low home values.

Lastly, also an important factor, my educational loans which I pay 10% of my income to at a minimum, sometimes more.

Tl;dr: moving to rural town with high rents but low home values. I have job security and eventually a high salary. The renter market in town is in high demand with many physicians moving in and out. Should I rent or buy? NYT calculator says if &lt;$800 rents available then rent. Average rent here is 1400-1600 + utilities. I'm leaning towards buying.

Will add tldr at end. 

So over the last 6 months my life's been a wild ride (not in a good way) I was fired from my job and was unemployed through the holiday season. However just starting early this year I found full time employment again. My issue is this: during the time I was unemployed I wasn't able to pay a lot of my bills consistently and I'm between past due rent, loans (unrelated to this brief period) and other expenses I find myself owing around $8,000.   Here is my question : given the obviously response of ""make more money and pay off everything"" I was wondering if there's a faster way to pay off the debts now so that my already falling credit score doesn't dive into the ""screwed for life"" area.  Relevant information: I'm 25, have a bachelor's, my annual income right now is only around 25 to 30k and that's generous.  Credit score is low 600s. 

I've been living on my own for a while and I'd really like to not move back in with my mom at 25 lol. Even if I did id still have all this debt, so I'm hoping maybe some of my fellow redditors have had some experience with this type of thing.  

TLDR; was unemployed for a few months accumulated quite a bit of debt (mainly rent and loans not related to being unemployed) now looking to repay roughly $8,000 in debt ASAP so I can work on rebuilding my credit score again.",3,1585659883,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fscjwq/what_should_i_do_from_here_debt_repayment/,personalfinance,1

fsch7a,sgrmm,"Toyota Financial Claiming I Never Paid My Truck Loan, But I Traded It In in 2012!","I bought a low-end model pickup truck back in 2008, and took the loan through Toyota Financial Services.  It was a 5 year loan, and the amount financed was somewhere around $20K. Never missed a payment, though I'm sure I may have been a week or two late once or twice over the course of the loan.

In 2012, I decided to upgrade to a slightly bigger truck, so I traded in the 2008 truck for a 2012 model at a Toyota dealership. I had just a few payments left on the original loan (I'd guess under $2K in principal remaining), so the dealership took the trade in, and my loan for my new truck was through a different lender. I haven't heard anything from TFS since then, so assumed that the normal process of the dealer paying off the lien to receive the title happened.

Yesterday, I received a letter from TFS claiming that I owed them $15K on that original loan!  They're giving me 30 days to contest the charges. I've called them, but their offices are on limited hours/staff due to the virus, so haven't actually spoken to anyone yet. I'm living at the same address since the original loan, so no chance that they sent any delinquency notices to another address and I missed them.

I'm pretty certain that I've discarded the documents from that original loan -- was over 12 years ago, and I'm usually pretty diligent about shredding unneeded paperwork.  

So what are my steps from here?? Do I deal with TFS?  How do I prove to them that I made all those payments after all this time?  Or do I let the dealer that I bought the second truck deal with it?  After all, they're the ones who took it as a trade in and were supposed to ensure that the lien on the first truck was discharged as part of the process.

Any advice as to the best steps to follow to get this resolved? As it's freaking me out to think that this may have been messed up!",79,1585659602,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fsch7a/toyota_financial_claiming_i_never_paid_my_truck/,personalfinance,1

When I turned 18 (2 months ago) I was fortunate enough to get into a state job program (Northern Cali, Lower Income Area) however during the first year I only take home around $1500 a month AFTER food/housing, which is automatically deducted from my (monthly) paycheck.

Now, after the first year, I’ll be making $30-40k at a permanent state job. When I accepted the job program offer, I thought it would be easy enough to Lyft/Uber everyday or take the bus as it was a few hundred miles away from my home town and I had to relocate to this city to better my life for the long run. 

I was severely wrong. The job-sites I work at range from anywhere to 15-25 miles away daily which cost around $90 a day (2 trips) with Lyft and busses aren’t available. Oh, also I’m the only one living-in so I can’t carpool. 

Would it be an alright decision to say lease a car for under $200 with minimal down? Would I even be able to find a lease or is that only for those with perfect credit? I have no credit now but I do have verifiable income for the next 12 months.

I was curious as to how you guys allocate your savings.

I don't consider myself to have crazy finances, in fact I am just getting my finances in check and playing catch-up after years of spending haphazardly/low-paying jobs.

***Current Financial Situation (29 y.o. male)***

I currently have 12K in a Ally High Interest Savings account, 

I keep only about a thousand in my day-to-day checking account. ( for bills, groceries, paying down credit card bills).

Additionally, I contribute 20% of my salary to a Roth IRA (valued at 3K of SPY shares). Currently not in an employer sponsored plan as I'm a contractor, but I have an old one (consisting of Roth Contributions valued at around 8K in a 2055 target date fund- not much).

When do you stop putting money in your high interest savings account and put it somewhere else?

I want this money to grow, but seeing that ally  yield is down to around 1.60%, I have 12K that isnt really ""sweating"" or ""being put to work.""

At the same time, I dont want to lose the money, like I did in my brokerage account or Roth account during economic uncertainty (Covid). 

When is a good time to stop saving in the Ally account and put the money elsewhere to sit and grow?

What are some Good places for it to sit and grow??? I'm not opposed to stocks and bonds, but wanted to hear what you guys had to say.

fsbax3,Local-Response,My parents are pushing me to go to college without a career plan.,"
I’m unsure if this is the right subreddit to post in but I need some alternate opinions on whether or not I’m making the correct decision.

I’m 19 years old and I currently work two separate jobs ever since I graduated from high school. My parents have been really adamant in me attending college ever since my final year in HS, but I did not want to go due in part to having no career path.

In my personal opinion, unless I were to go for a field such as nursing, engineering or a career that I believe will lead to steady employment, I’m not going to school.

Unfortunately, I was never a great student and it wasn’t for a lack of trying. I was diagnosed with aspergers and other mental disabilities, which made studying a challenge during high school. Because of this, I don’t consider myself to be really academically inclined for college in any shape or form.

Basically my schedule is like this;

1). I have a day office job where I work from 8:30 to 4:30 PM. I have my own health insurance in case of any issues. It’s not bad but it’s repetitive data entry which I enjoy. It pays $16.75 an hour.

2). My second job I work from 9:30 PM to 2:00 AM at a warehouse. It only pays $12.00 an hour but it’s not far from home. The only downsides is that after working here for close to a year I’m feeling my body dealing with the effects.

All of my income goes to my family, with the exception of a savings account and some funds for myself when needed. I’m fairly frugal and don’t waste my money on entertainment.

I have taken career tests and unfortunately a lot of the careers I discovered don’t make much money. In regards to my goals I’m fairly simple;

1). I don’t want a relationship or my own family. I’ll take care of myself in my own apartment if I can afford it.

My family really wants me to attend college and while I understand where they’re coming from, I’m against just getting a general studies degree which won’t lead anywhere.

I live at home with my parents, my Dad has advanced lung cancer and therefor is a high risk to Corona virus. I live in the UK where most jobs have been shut down and people are on furlough pay (Government pays 80% of your wages if your job has closed,employer can chose to pay the remaining 20% but doesn't have to) 

I work in a factory with 300+ people, the work isn't essential and it blows my mind we haven't closed down, furlough isn't available to us. Working in a such high contaminous environment and then going home to my Dad is not an option.

I emailed HR and explained my situation and they said the only option I have is to take unpaid leave.

My other option is to quickly rent a flat for 6-12months and continue going to work. But this means I wouldn't be able to see my parents until the Virus is no longer a problem which I don't see happening for a long time. 

I do have quite a bit in the bank ( I was saving up for a mortgage) So I could get through a year unpaid but its obviously not ideal, I just can't justify paying for my own place and working full time just to save a few hundred a month but never seeing my Dad who is in awful health.

fsakdf,hiiiinuzu,Need advice: the root canal that ruined my credit score,"(This  is in the US, btw) Okay, so a year and a half ago I got a root canal.  Never got billed for the procedure. A month later I emailed the  endodontist saying ""I haven't been billed. Can you confirm that you have  the correct billing information for me?"" Got a reply saying ""We'll  check on it"" then never heard anything again.

I  was okay with it, I thought I just got a free root canal. Fast forward  to November 2019, over a year later, my credit score drops by 120 points  overnight. I can't figure out why. I've never been late on a credit  card payment, never had any other debt. So I ordered a credit report.  Nothing surprising on there. Since then I've been trying to figure out  what to do.

Just today I signed up  for credit karma and see that I have a $189 collection out from the  endodontist, i.e. the price of the root canal. The collection was opened  last May, almost a year ago. I've never gotten a call, email, letter,  anything from the endodontist or from the debt collector. This is  probably my fault as well. Since the root canal (this is before the  collection was opened) I moved to Europe, got a European phone number,  and gave up my US number. So my address has changed and my phone number  has changed.

Just to be precise,  and to make matters more complicated, there are two US addresses  involved. One is the place I was living at the time when I got the root  canal. This is the address the endodontist had on file for me. The other  is my permanent address, which is also the billing address for my  credit card and debit card, and the address associated with my bank  accounts. This address hasn't changed in many years. Presumably the debt  collector also has this address for me.
I'm  not sure what to do. I'm happy to pay the amount, but I also don't want  to accept the hit to my credit score. Am I able to dispute the  collection because I was never informed of it? Or am I at fault for  changing my phone number and address? Should I dispute it or just pay it  and be done with it?

I was convinced that if I ever wanna escape the working class lifestyle, I have to start dealing drugs, pimping out whores, or committing fraud when I become an adult, which is happening this year actually, I graduate high school and turn 18 this coming May and June.

What changed that belief was my big sister's old friend. She lives in Kailua, a rich white-people town, in a freaking $1.2 million house that she *owns*, and she's 31! She also raises a 7 year old daughter. The reason she broke this belief is that there's no way would I ever believe that this girl had the heart to do those kinda things.

Only thing is though, how did someone as young as her become so financially loaded that quickly? I mean she works for a stage equipment service, not exactly prime salaries there.

fs9gd8,ic3m4ch1n3,Moving and Financial Conundrums,"Hey sub, long time lurker. First time poster. Appreciate the insight and perspective over the past couple of years - it has helped me greatly. 

I’m in an interesting situation. Before the pandemic struck, I took a new position within the same company that requires relocation. Company added some relocation assistance to the transition, not that it’s super important at this point in the story, but that was back in early December. 

I found a cheap-ish shared room/apartment to rent for $600/mo in the new city while we worked to pack &amp; fix up our current house to sell. 

Fast forward to now, we are about to close on the sale of our current house next week if all goes to plan. Little bit delayed due to coronavirus understandably, but the buyer wants to proceed. They have agreed to delayed occupancy, and we have an agreement to rent the house from them until, at the latest for now, July 1st. Whew. 

Here’s the predicament. Coronavirus aside, the housing market here in Alaska as a whole is declining. On the sale of my starter home alone since we purchased in 2014, I’ve lost about 4%. That’s pennies compared to homes in other neighborhoods in my current city (Fairbanks). Housing in the new city (Anchorage), is about 20% higher, but relatively flat. 

Alaska’s economy lives and dies on the price of oil. At under $20 per barrel right now, the state is going to be in rough shape. Dire straits even, given the pandemic going on right now. 

My wife and I have been talking about our future housing situation, looking at listings and neighborhoods. I just don’t know if I can stomach investing in a house at this point when I know the bottom is going to drop out. And I think it’s already starting to happen...

But finding a place in the city that will rent to someone with two large dogs that I can comfortably live in for some time has been tough to find, to say the least. Current living arrangement won’t work with the two dogs. Though if the landlord allowed it, would be incredible... may have that conversation...

With the stock market also trending downward and the prime lending rate close to 0%, do you bite the bullet and take the loss on the valuation of the house to save on interest? Do you buy an RV to live out of for a while and put a lot of cash into the S&amp;P 500 and ride it for a resurgence? I’m attracted by some of my friends success casually trading, I won’t lie there. 

Financially speaking, we are pretty sound. I’ll have a sizable chunk of cash in equity from the sale of our current home, plus some savings. We do have some student loan debt, about $42K. Was about $80k when she graduated with her masters but we’ve been triple paying about $2K/month to get rid of it as fast as we can. But that and the mortgage is the only real debt that we have today.

So what would you do? Can’t go homeless, and I’ve realistically got about 8 weeks before my... concern turns to worry...",4,1585644494,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs9gd8/moving_and_financial_conundrums/,personalfinance,1

I looked at my checking account today and I noticed that there was a electronic bill pay check written under my name to an unnamed source. The check was under my name and address.

I called my bank provider (ally bank) and after an hour or so conversation was able to open up a dispute on the charge. They also closed my old checking account and transferred the remaining funds to a new one for me. 

They said the would get back to me within 10 business days and to call the company (interactivebrokers.com)that the fake check was written to. I don’t have an account with them and haven’t heard of them until today. 

I spoke with a support rep and he said would escalate my issue to a higher up and took some information from me regarding my old bank account number the payment was made from and said they would get back to me tomorrow. 

Neither of these conversations left me feeling 100% confident I would see my money returned and I’m stressing out with the end of the month coming up as I can no longer afford rent due to this.

I tried to renew it online but I had two traffic tickets from 7+ years that equal to about $1500...

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing...My rent this month will jump up from $1100 to $1800 due to me not putting in my move out notice 60 days out at least.....

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing....My business which I make almost 60% of my income has been shut down for two months due to the corona virus...So my income has been cut by more than half for two months and I'm taking on an additional $2100 in expenses this month...My rent is also due tomorrow and im pretty sure I need to get a temp ID card (which I can if I pay $1500 fee) ASAP so I can still have this job offer which I really need right now due to me being almost out of work.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that one of our clients is about 3 months behind on paying me and I've paid my contractors out of pocket (my savings, which has been depleted by almost 90% in the last 6 months due to increased costs in my business) So I have maybe one weeks worth of savings left.

&amp;#x200B;

PLUS SIDE...I do have exactly enough to cover my additional costs of $1500 for ID renewal (tomorrow) and the $1800 in additional rent (Due April 24th) but I'll be short $400 on rent due in three days but I can take it from the $1800 due later in the month and be $400 short on that but it gives me three weeks to deal with it so I can due that BUT I will not have any money left other than the paycheck from my part time job which covers about 30% of my monthly expenses (I could take the $400 from there but ill be in a small bind again.

\-Depleted 90% of savings in the last 6 months on business, down to one weeks worth of expenses in Savings

\-Have enough to cover $1800 and $1500 but need to pay $1100 rent this week, would leave me $400 short on the $1800 but I have three weeks to come up with that extra if need be.

I went back over the emails to see if I missed a notice that the price was changing or that the renewal was coming due without luck.  The Washington Post's FAQ says cancellations are at the end of the billing cycle and there is no refund.

I contacted the Washington Post and Paypal requesting an immediate cancellation and refund on the basis that I was not given notice of the price change.  Any other suggestions?

fs88uc,OCDisLife,Advice for a 20yr old with a hefty credit card balance,"Throw away account as I have several friends who troll this subreddit...

I’m 20 years old. And I have a credit card with ~ 3000$ on it. I am able to maintain minimum payments on it. I just can’t pay it all off. If covid didn’t hit right around now I would still be able to make some money on the side to help but now I’m stuck at home with no income until the summer where I have a decent paying internship (praying covid doesn’t screw that up either...)

Should I talk to my parents about it? I ask because I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder), so confronting even my parents about a topic that would disappoint leads way to me spending hours up for multiple nights freaking out about even considering asking them.

Should I just keep maintaining minimum payments on it without discussing it with them, or would it be best to sit down and ask for help/guidance.

Going to bed... will check responses in morning.

tl;dr - 20yr old with 3K on credit card, able to pay minimum every month, unsure if should tell parents. Seeking advice for how to handle this situation.",18,1585638057,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs88uc/advice_for_a_20yr_old_with_a_hefty_credit_card/,personalfinance,1

fs7v3l,Mental_Conundrum,Trying to refinance my home but don't know a way...,"Hello Redditors,

I normally don't like to ask for help but if anyone reading this could give some advice or like to share anything that might help me see my issue in a different light it would greatly be appreciated. With the interest rates as low as they are, like many I am trying to refinance but just cant seem to do it. Here is my situation:

**Home Value:** $280,000  
**Amount Left on First Mortgage Loan:**  $215,000  
**Current Interest Rate:** 5%  
**Monthly Payment:** $1550

Now the issue, during the loan process I qualified for subordinate financing and used two CalHFA programs to purchase my home. This resulted in 2 second liens (they are silent subordinate loans that are due when I either finish paying my first mortgage or if I ever refinance). So in wanting to refinance my first mortgage, I have to find a way to pay those 2 loans since they will become due and I cant find a way to refinance and take cash out to pay those off. Doing so (refinancing the first mortgage and taking out $17,750 to payoff those two loans) makes my LTV jump to 83% (when ideally its better to be at 80% or lower) so all mortgage companies I have spoken to tell me that they cant help. 

Here is the info on the two silent loans:

**Subordinate Loan 1:** $8,750 with a 2.5% interest rate (My Home Assistance Program)  
**Subordinate Loan 2:** $9,000 with a 0% interest rate (Zero Interest Program)

Anywho, I am at a loss and don't know what to do... I have been talking to many mortgage companies for about 2 weeks now and they are all saying the same... is there something I am not seeing or that you would recommend I do? I am all ears and appreciate any advice, comments, or plans you might have.

*About Me:*   
*I am in my mid 30's, have no other debt except for my home, unfortunately have no savings (these last couple of years I made it my goal to get rid of all debt and I accomplished that this year).

We just got out of most of our debts from college except for my car loan about $800 monthly. We have a relatively strong income, great credit, and the price range that we are wanting to buy is a max of 300k currently (Likely a condo)

We live in Canada B.C. where mortgages require a minimum of 5% down. We would need just 15k for a down payment however with the rent we are paying it would take us a a year to save up enough for a down payment and closing costs

Due to Covid-19 the bank of Canada has cut its rates quite a bit.

In this situation would it make sense to front the down payment with a 0% interest credit line and get it paid back with a cash back mortgage? From my understanding they are 1-1.5% higher than a normal interest rates.

I think it’s likely interest rates will increase by the time we even scraped up enough for a down payment and closing costs so I would break even?

This is the situation:

I made a purchase for $440.99, I never received the order and merchant refunded me it. I received the refund of $440.99, then same day the refund hit my bank, the merchant rebilled me for $440.99 and refuses to refund it without giving me a reason to why they recharged me. I now have 2 transactions for $440.99, the first one was refunded so I call Capital One to dispute THE SECOND charge of $440.99. First issue is, the employee who opened the dispute for me mistakenly credits me for only $44.99 (I have proof via letter stating ""I am receiving a credit of $44.99 for the charges being disputed of $440.99""). I have called multiple times to get the missing $396 temporary credit that I was owed, and they finally issue it after a dozen phone calls over 2-3 weeks. A few days after the $396 temporary credit was posted to my account, I got a transaction rebill for $44.99 (now my full $440.99 temporary credit just went down to $396).... and agents couldn't tell me why I was being rebilled for the $44.99, and after speaking to two supervisors at the dispute team, they both suggested to just wait for the dispute outcome. Fast forward 2 weeks, I got rebilled for the remainder of $396 AND $440.99. 

Their outcome was the merchant already refunded me, but KEEP IN MIND, merchant only refunded me for the first transaction, not the second. However, Capital One is stating merchant issued a refund for the 2nd transaction I am disputing, when in fact they only issued a refund for the first transaction of $440.99. Now I have a purchase adjustment/transaction rebill for $44.99, $396, and $440.99 totaling to $881.98. My $440.99 dispute just turned into a $881.98 shit storm, and I can't get a hold of the Capital One dispute because their hours are not 24/7 and the last 4 days I have called, I have been on hold for more than hour and cannot stay on the phone for hours just to get an agent from disputes then explain the entire situation over.

I have filed a BBB complaint and still no response from them. Any other outlets to attempt to fix this?

Last year I did a maxed out Roth backdoor ($6000) which I reported on my 2019 taxes. I entered all the necessary information using Credit Karma including a Form 8606 and double checked the forms prior to submitting to make sure the amount due indicated on the Credit Karma dashboard matched the actual tax draft form. Was pretty straight forward, I didn't have anything too crazy; just a few stock trades, the backdoor, and using standard deductions. The numbers added up, so I submitted. 

Once the forms were accepted, I went ahead and started to pay the dues online. Just to make sure I was paying the right amount, I opened the ""accepted"" tax form to get the exact dollar amount, and lo and behold, the amount due indicated no longer matched what the Credit Karma dashboard was showing. The accepted forms were populated with about $2000 more for federal dues and $1000 more for state dues. 

I looked through every line to redo the math and pulled up the pre-submitted and accepted forms for side-by-side comparison. Turns out the ""accepted"" 1040 had a line populated that was not populated in the pre-submitted 1040. Line 4b, taxable amount was populated with the $6000 that I converted with my IRA backdoor, hence increasing my taxable income by that amount and my taxes owed by the amount above. I checked the accepted Form 8606 and is populated correctly, line 18, taxable amount is empty as it should be. 

This is a pretty expensive mistake, and I have been trying to reach out to Credit Karma a few times to correct this, but they have not followed up with any of those times. What do I do now? How do I go about correcting this filing? I have not paid any of my owed taxes yet.

fs6ma9,MoneyforNewRoof,Need a new roof and we owe the IRS... Not sure how to handle it.,"So long story short we bought a house last year, our insurance company decided we need a new roof or repair by 5/23/2020 or they'll drop us due to the way some shingles look (it's not leaking), the original plan was to put one on in \~5 years since we purchased the house. We received some estimates, 2/3 estimates said the roof was unrepairable and the 3rd suggested against it but gave us a quote. The lowest replacement cost estimate we're comfortable with is $9,200

We didn't withhold our taxes correctly in 2019 (we've learned now, corrected it for the rest of the year and will revisit before next year), and owe the IRS $4,600.

Due to some other issues we had before this, our emergency fund is low.

We owe too much on the house at the moment, so we cannot get a HELOC loan for the roof. The roofers will take credit cards but I'm a little hesitant to get one of those 0% intro APR credit cards. 

Together we earn about $3,550 after taxes every 2 weeks. We are maxing out our respective 401ks, not sure if I should change that for the short term. I picked up Uber Eats after work for the time being. 

I estimate that we'd have around $7,000 to $8,500 in cash by 5/1 after bills and mortgage payment (and before this stimulus thing), but I'm worried about letting it go that long.

I guess my questions are as follows:

1. We got quotes for other insurance companies, but I'm not sure how they're going to handle the roof, should we just change insurers until we're better prepared? Will our new insurer know that our old insurer would not be renewing?
2. I haven't made a payment yet against the amount owed to the IRS, just submitted our taxes \~3 days ago. Is there something in particular I should be doing because I'm not going to be able to make a lump sum payment for the full amount on the taxes... I filed on freetaxusa and said I would pay the IRS directly.
3. Should I just try and apply for one of the 0% apr credit cards?
4. Should we just go with the repair even though it's not recommended? Repair amount is $750

I guess I'm open to suggestions on how do deal with this. Insurance is required for the mortgage, our jobs are safe as we both work different healthcare fields.",9,1585630000,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs6ma9/need_a_new_roof_and_we_owe_the_irs_not_sure_how/,personalfinance,1

fs62g9,silly321,How do you advise that I deal with this debt collection letter? Thanks in advance!," 

How do you advise that I deal with this debt collection letter?  How much would this lower my credit score if I don’t pay it?

I’m in California.  I received a letter from Lyons Credit Services Incorporated, a private debt collections company based in Las Vegas, to collect on a $144 debt. This company was hired by Lenovo for a laptop that I had purchased from them via a credit card transaction.

Current plan:

I’ve never dealt with this sort of thing before.  I’m currently planning on responding via writing stating that it’s not a legitimate debt, including the letter from my credit card company stating that they found in my favor regarding the $144 charge, and  asking them not to contact me.  

I’ve already sunk so much time and stress into this. I don’t want to pay the $144 as the laptop has a broken touchpad and camera and Lenovo was unable to replace it and the credit card company found in my favor.  I’m assuming that it’s going to leave a negative mark on my credit report and lower my score because I’m not willing to pay it.

I’ve never had a bad debt before and my credit score is 795.  How much do you think this would lower my credit score?

Would you please advise?

Context and details: 

I purchased a $144 laptop from Lenovo on Black Friday via a credit card charge.  The laptop’s touchpad and camera were broken upon arrival.  I spent 10 hours on the phone with Lenovo trying to get a replacement laptop and was unable to get a replacement.  I was put on hold for hours and got the run around. 

I disputed the $144 charge with my credit card company.  After a lot of work and filling out forms and arguing my case via writing, my credit card company agreed with me and said that I didn’t need to pay the $144 charge.  Lenovo stated that they had no documentation of my calls but I had documented them, sent those notes to the credit card company, and they found in my favor.   My credit card company sent me a letter in the mail stating that they found in my favor.

I still have the laptop.

One month later (today), I received the letter from Lyons Credit Services Incorporated  trying to collect the $144 debt.

It is exactly like those ones in a hotel room that are both heating and cooling. When the A/C is on, the livingroom/kitchen area seems to be the only area impacted by the cool air.

Option 2: Wait for gain to vanish. Given today's market volatility, that could happen. I'll sell as soon as there is any loss (I can place a sell Stop order), that way, once my Traditional IRA reverts back to $14000 or below, I can convert to Roth IRA as if nothing stupid had happened.

But when I was doing this on Fidelity, it is asking me whether I want federal taxes withheld or not.

There is a note at the bottom of the page saying:
&gt; IRS regulations require the Custodian/Trustee of your distributing IRA to withhold federal income tax at the rate of 10% from your gross IRA distributions, unless you elect not to have withholding apply.

It sounds to me like i should choose NOT to withhold taxes. Is that correct?",4,1585623740,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs55wr/should_i_withhold_or_not_withhold_federal_taxes/,personalfinance,1
fs55h3,donman24,Prioritize Student Loans or Building Emergency Fund?,"Hi all, 

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic the US Government suspended interest accrual and loan payments on all federal student loans.  Fortunately, I have a job where I can work from home and continue to still have stable income for the foreseeable future. Also, so you better understand some of my prior decision making, my parents are stable and decently well off, so if I had a true emergency I would be financially covered with a ‘zero interest loan.’

I am a recent college grad with ~$13k of Federal Student Loans. I have always wanted to stop living paycheck to paycheck, and I believe this is best achieved by having a emergency fund for one off’s along with 3 months or so of living expenses saved. However, I have failed to build these funds because I HATE the fact I’m in debt and consistently pay down as much debt as I possibly can at the expense of financial freedom. 

I have some decent chunks of change coming in here soon consisting of (1) tax refund’s and (2) a COVID-19 stimulus check. 

Given interest rates have been suspended should I use this as a time to get ahead of the federal loan at the expense of having an emergency funds?",6,1585623691,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs55h3/prioritize_student_loans_or_building_emergency/,personalfinance,1

fs4yrz,meddebtquestion_anon,Medical Debt Collection..Dispute or Wait 7 Years?,"My husband was an international student in the US. All international students at our school were required to have the same school-provided insurance. He played sports and needed to have two surgeries for sports-related injuries during college. He came from a country with nationalized healthcare and assumed the college would cover remaining balances and did not follow up. 

Fast forward a little while and we are dating. I find out about the medical bills and do some digging. It's been years and I don't remember the details, but do know there were some issues with the insurance company paying providers. Providers actually started having students pay portions of their predicted bill up front if they had this insurance. I worked out what I thought he owed (&gt;$10,000) and showed his parents. They said there's no way they are supposed to pay that and also did not follow up. 

After we got married, I saw a small medical debt (less than $200) on his credit report that went to collections in May 2016. We had moved multiple times and had no information about the former insurance provider, no former bills, not even the spreadsheet I made for his parents years before. I called the creditor in December 2018 to request to pay to delete. The creditor started asking for more information, including his middle name, as they might have other debt in his name. I got scared (I can only imagine the cost of two surgeries) and hung up. They never restarted the debt date after this call. 

We planned on waiting 7 years (May 2023) for the debt to fall off (statute of limitations in the state has passed). I don't know how the date on the collection is determined. If it's based on when the actual charge occurred, it must be incorrect because we left the state in 2014. We have good credit other than this one collection. We would like to buy a house in the next two years and are afraid the collection might impact that. 

Also, I just checked Credit Karma and Equifax is no longer showing the debt (as of 3/25). It is still showing on Transunion (last reported 3/6). I'm not sure what that means. 

What should we do? Consider disputing the debt? Wait 3 years and 2 months to buy a house? Any help would be much-appreciated!",13,1585622944,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs4yrz/medical_debt_collectiondispute_or_wait_7_years/,personalfinance,1

I recently bought a house and the mortgage company estimated my taxes to be 20X what they ended up being due to some incompetence on their part. Anyways, I got a $2k check in the mail, which is the overage from my escrow account. I’m thinking about what to do with the money. 

I make $120k per year base and have $12k in cash right now (used a lot of money on the house). I have no cc debt and a healthy 401k account. 

Should I use the surplus toward the principal on the house, invest the money in equities, or just keep it in cash for a rainy day?

fs4syp,mycoalswin,Trying to understand retirement/trad vs Roth IRA for medical resident and employment,"Sorry it's a long post, would appreciate the help!

tl;dr: **When exactly does one withdraw from their account for retirement? Does one (or would I) be withdrawing when I am in the higher income bracket (which justifies having a Roth all the years), or does everyone generally withdraw maybe a year after they've retired so that they are in a lower income bracket (does it work like that?)?**

Hi everyone! I'm entering residency next year and am new to the personal finance game. I've perused many online sources regarding personal finance, and I'd like to say that I am familiar with the broad range of topics and vocabulary. One thing I cannot decipher is why most sources (including those tailored for medical residents) say go for the Roth.

I understand that income tax brackets play a role here. Say for example during residency I will be in the 22% federal tax bracket. Throughout my career, I'll likely be around the mid-30%s (let's just say 35%). I have read that people should opt for the Roth if they know they will be in a higher tax bracket throughout their careers.

Following advice, I should open a Roth so that I am only taxed at 22% on my contributions now. That makes sense. Then keep contributing through Backdoor throughout employment. Come withdrawal time, I can withdraw this money tax-free. **When exactly does one withdraw from their account for retirement? Does one (or would I) be withdrawing when I am in the higher income bracket (which justifies having a Roth all the years), or does everyone generally withdraw maybe a year after they've retired so that they are in a lower income bracket (does it work like that?)?**

As a thought scenario, what if I opened a traditional IRA for residency + employment and save all that tax money upfront? Use that saved money to invest somewhere else (overall, more money to allow growth). Then withdraw when I am fully retired and have regressed from an income bracket in the 30' to 20's?

&gt;**Loan Modification:** Permanently change the terms of your mortgage to bring it current.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Repayment Plan:** Breaks up the amount owed that  accumulated during the forbearance period. The balance is added to  future payment until the full amount is repaid.

The quoted text at the top explains how everything is to be handled in regards to the mortgage loan deferment program.

My question is - If I utilize this service, will it affect the required 2-year ownership period to avoid taxes on capital gains?

$820/mo Rent+Utilities

58k/yr - I believe 2800$/mo after etc
No savings
$820/mo rent+utilities
$750/mo with 70k loans remaining, mostly private (7 yrs left, just refinanced to lower interest)
700$/mo car+ins (2.5 years left to pay off new car - 7 minute commute)
 --- around $450/mo left, most spent on food and misc

goals: purchase small home, 1st child before I turn 30 (not yet married. as we have discussed, the home would be in my name, and marriage would happen prior to child). The before 30 is a goal because my mother is older. 

We live in a expensive college town, on the cheapest outer edge. I have a 1 hour commute west, and partner has a 7 min commute west. Ive been in my job for 4 years, and been actively searching and interviewing for a new job for 1 year, but unfortunately its highly competitive and my degree is not very applicable to the technologies in our city. My partners job is very stable and his workplace is awesome.

Homes in this area are $300k min - which is what we would look at. My health ins deductible is $6000 max, so I expect a pregnancy would cost up to that. Im the bread winner and likely will always be as I tend to be more motivated and progress faster. Im afraid of a pregnancy affecting my performance and potentially costing my job, since i work in chemicals and would require significant job modification. Daycare would be 1500-2000$/mo in this area.

The city I work in is very cheap but very dangerous, poor schools, one of the murder capitals. Everything between our current city and my work, is just as expensive as our current city. There are no other living options that would not increase my commute, which I am not willing to consider a longer commute.


with all this aside just... where do you guys advise we start planning? I feel so overwhelmed that we wont be able to afford a home and any children, especially considering the costs of daycare here. my first focus is getting a job closer to home, so we can look at living a little further out of town (slightly cheaper). Is it unwise to have a child with so much debt? I am divorced and was heavily financially taken advantage of so we have discussed and it is clear I will not pay for any of the partners debt, though I have offered when we do eventually marry we will work on the debt jointly.

Maybe I need really blunt feedback that we need to leave this city. I just dont know where to start.

I searched both the app and the website and I cannot figure out how you cancel this payment. Do I have to wish it away? Or what am I missing? I can edit/delete all her other recurring payments but not the mortgage. 

I've been on hold waiting to talk to someone at Wells Fargo for almost three hours now and I'm worried that if we're on hold until midnight, the payment is going to process and her checking account is going to be overdrawn.

Any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance and say healthy!",13,1585617818,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs3nf4/how_the_heck_do_you_cancel_a_scheduledrecurring/,personalfinance,1

fs3lih,Pigpen_The_Cat,"If you can't pay rent tomorrow, be proactive and write your landlord today. Tips/tools in comments.","First, add up how much you owe if it's more than just April's rent (any facility fees, passed-on utility bills, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Next, check whether there is an eviction moratorium or other tenant protection action in your state/county/city. There's a [list of state-level and many local measures here](https://blog.augrented.com/renting-during-the-novel-coronavirus-outbreak/). That will give you a better idea of what you can ask from your landlord. The Federal [CARES Act](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/cares-act-temporary-moratorium-on-99459/) only applies to certain subsidized housing and properties with a ""Federally backed mortgage loan or a Federally backed multifamily mortgage loan."" Especially with smalltime landlords, that's a majority of buildings. You can check the mortgage papers for many major cities online - Google ""county recorder"" for your location. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, go through your budget to see what your financial situation is. Decide what you want to ask your landlord for: time to pay (and maybe a payment plan after moratoriums expire), a discount on what you owe, or a full waiver or rent freeze. Don't offer to pay more than you know you will be able to afford.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, write a formal letter describing your circumstances and the background for your request. Try to keep it to one page. Stuck for how to start? You can use [this tool to generate a letter to your landlord](https://augrented.com/covid) and then just mail it, or download a Word file and edit it to fit your situation.

So I bought the hamster and a 10 gallons cage, but many online say that you need at least a 20 gallons cage (and they are very vocal here on Reddit r\hamsters). 

I saw [this](https://www.amazon.com/Niteangel-Glass-Cage-Hamsters-Gerbils/dp/B07THDZXHQ?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) cage on Amazon but was sold out.

I got excited and after looking at the website a bit I decided to buy the cage. I have to say the website looked a bit weird and I was a bit suspicious but then seeing so much merchandise and the customer reviews I decided to buy the cage nonetheless. After my order, I received an email to track the order status. 

After one week I haven't heard anything yet and so I become more suspicious. I do a quick search online and see that some people refer to this website as a scam. I email the website customer service but the email bounces back. I message them through the website itself but I haven't received an answer yet. Then I get a hunch and I check out [Amazon's reviews](https://imgur.com/a/InWJjwx) to the Niteangel cage that's out of stock... they are exactly the same [reviews](https://imgur.com/a/4GqqfwR)! Have they scraped Amazon to build their website?

A part of me would like to hope that this cage will arrive at some point, but another part me is certain that I have been scammed.

Now what to do? I paid through Paypal that's linked to my checking account. The charge on my checking account is still pending.

The Quarterly HOA (Homeowners Association) fee of my property is due on April 01; I mailed a check ten days earlier considering the uncertainties these days on a delivery due to the craziness of Coronavirus. I expected my HOA to honor the date written on the check and deposit it on the due date.

However, HOA deposited the check on March 25th, and it was returned as I don't have sufficient balance in my checking account until March 30th

Moreover, no one from HOA contacted me regarding the check rebounce. I was only notified by my bank that an overdraft fee is occured due to this.

**Explanation from HOA:**

I have tried to talk to five people for this matter but no one even had the courtesy to let me know until today that the returned check is void and I need to mail a new one asap.

They simply responded: Unfortunately, the payments are sent to the banks PO Box and they are scanned immediately.  The scanner does not recognize a check date, regardless of it being post-dated.

In a nutshell, my accountant recommended my spouse and I fully fund Roth 401(k) accounts vs. traditional 401(k)'s in 2020.

fs268d,FamedRedditor,Opening a checking account,"Hey guys so first I'm gonna give some background on my situation. I'm currently 21 years old and basically financially illiterate. My parents handled my finances for my entire life and basically took any money I've ever received (including gifts etc.). Now I'm not hopping on here to complain about that. I want to move forward, become independent and escape.

I've accumulated about $1-2k in the last few months and really want to open up my own bank account and start using that money to cultivate a business idea I had. All of this money is in cash as most of it came from tutoring/some gifts from friends for my 21st bday and whatnot, all given directly to me while I was away at college, so my parents have no idea it exists and I want to keep it that way.

So my questions are:

-If I open up a bank account at my local chase branch and deposit all my cash, will I run into issues with taxes? Especially, considering some of this money was in the form of gifts, while the majority was from working an unofficial job (when I say tutoring I literally just helped some freshmen and some friends pass some math classes lol, I was paid entirely in cash/venmo). 

-Also if I open up an account will I be required to have mail from the bank sent to my parents home? (still living under their roof until college). If that's the case is there any way to avoid that?

-And finally, anyone have any recommendations for a better bank? My reasoning for chase was that it's close enough for me to walk/bike and deposit my money, but I still need to research and look into any fees and stuff I might have to pay.

fs1w1c,burnerburningaway,"~Another grad school post for an MS, wary of debt but received tuition waiver for first year and small stipend","Undergrad is in engineering and MS would be in engineering at a UC (Berkley/LA/SD). Tuition  (\~18K). would be paid for the first year, although it is a two year program generally. Was given a very modest stipend for first year. I acknowledge that I am luck to receive any aid, but I still am a bit bemused at the cost.

I am guessing a 40K student loan at some point (15K for tuition + living expenses for second year + maybe for first year too). The area is extremely expensive and I would definitely choose to go if I could feel the expense was ""worth it"".

 Academically and for career growth I imagine it to be. But having been working for the last year was really jarring how expenses add up. I dont have much really saved since I paid off a sizable loan already. And housing is \*extremely\* expensive. Keep reading about 1000 being a bare min that is commutable.

What are things I should consider? I am really stuck. I cannot work under this stipend more than part time. How do people go to grad school under these conditions. The program is said to be very good in CA.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started a new job with a base salary of $127K and my understanding was that calculating contributions should be simple: since 401(k) deferrals are pre-tax and I want to defer as close to $19,500 as possible, I could just divide the 401(k) max by my base to determine the percentage of my salary that should be deferred. In my case, 127000 / 19500 is a little over 15%, so I set a 15% contribution. 

I got my first paycheck last week (biweekly) and a few days later, saw a 401(k) contribution of just under $977. This is confusing to me because each paycheck (pretax) should be roughly $4885. With contributions at 15%, I assumed this would result in a $732 deferral per pay period (15% of 4885), but the additional deferral means I need to decrease my contributions otherwise I'd go over the limit for the year.

* Emergency Fund: $0, unless we count the $1,500 in savings that I was trying to build into my emergency fund. It's been hard though since I give my dad some money every month and put aside money to help pay off my sister's debt.

Every month, I spend down to the last dollar in either bills or what little I can put towards savings. With our tax returns, we were going to pay off her credit card debt (was planning on waiting until June before we paid it off). Now I am wondering if it is better to leave it for now and have money in the bank in the worst case scenario that we both get laid off? 

I know I'm doing a lot wrong in the advice that personal finance usually provides. I was slowly trying to fix that by helping my dad and sister pay off debt so that the household was more stable and not overly reliant on me.

fs17c7,TheNamesGrant,Parents Claiming me on Taxes,"This will be my first time filing taxes for myself so I apologize for the stupid question. I am a 20 year old college student and I was wondering if I should go along and file as a dependent. My parents paid in total $6878.67 for me this year (car insurance, health insurance, tuition, occasional help in rent, free food?). While I paid $4430 for rent alone, plus an additional income of $6904.33 (life expenses I guess) from work, plus $7500 from tuition ($5000 from scholarships, $2500 student loans). Math alone I received less than half support from my parents. Therefore, I think I should file as independent, so I can get more money back from my tax returns (education credit).

But my mom is demanding that I file as dependent, I fear they will cut me off if I say no. At this point I can't afford to pay auto and health insurance. I am pretty sure they will not give me any money from their tax returns. And I could use this money, I will be broke after paying rent this April because my work closed temporarily this/next month. My parents have ensured me they will pay any expenses if I can't afford it. I am pretty sure they have a combined income of 150k+, and from what my mom said they would qualify for a lower tax bracket if I was claimed as a dependent.

I love my parents, but that college credit would be real nice right now. What should I do?",15,1585608782,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs17c7/parents_claiming_me_on_taxes/,personalfinance,1

fs15z6,Mental-Room,"Advice needed: Sudden payout, student loans, and the current market","Late 20's, married, currently freelancing lightly, combined income of $80k. Former employer is being acquired. My expected payout is \~$2M. Really anxious about preserving this cash.

2 large variables that'll affect my strategy: my student loans and the current market.

On loans: I have \~$500k in federal student loans from grad school. Currently in forbearance (due to current situation) and then $0 monthly payments until September 30. Beyond that, my plan is to find a way to minimize monthly payments and/or get on PSLF. Putting 25% of my payout into my loans just doesn't feel like the wisest thing – but it might.

On the current market: It's obviously taken a huge hit and will continue to for at least the next couple months. Can't help but feel that coming into this amount of cash in this rare situation poses an opportunity to grow this wealth aggressively as the market inevitably recovers.

So overall, my initial high-level approach is minimize loan payments and take advantage of current market conditions to invest and aggressively grow my money. Given living expenses &amp; emergency funds are covered, is this a crazy approach?

fs15y7,Virus4762,Buying a foreclosed home,"I've been researching the topic of buying a foreclosed home (mostly on Reddit) and have been finding multiple comments like:

&amp;#x200B;

""Really the biggest downside is you're buying as is with no warranties as far as condition. It's on you to do a complete inspection and figure out what (if anything) is wrong with the house and price that into your negotiation. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know next to nothing about buying houses. I always thought the above was true for any house that you buy. I mean, if you buy a house the traditional way then, after the purchase is finalized, you discover that the roof leaks badly when it rains, isn't that totally on you? That's always the impression I've been under. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, it seems strange that you're responsible for any past liens/debt on the house after you purchase a foreclosed home. Couldn't that issue be addressed with a 5 second question - or - shouldn't it be something the agent is obligated to tell you (or at the very least a topic that comes up) before your final purchase?

My first post on reddit. Curious what debt I should tackle first in my mission to bring my monthly expenses down. 

Credit cards all get paid off monthly. 

I have 2 outstanding student loans and an auto payment. 

First student loan has a balance of $14,500 and a rate of 6% (this may be variable as well)-payment is $136.88 per month but I pay $250 currently. 

Second student loan has a balance of $16,200 and 4.66% average interest rate (it’s variable)-payment is $130 per month but I pay $230 currently. 

Auto loan is $33,000 at 3.5% and it’s worth probably $55,000 - I have paid some chunks down on this but the payment is $789 per month. 

Other than that I have a mortgage that is $1800 a month. Taxes and insurance that are probably another $1200 a month. 

Income is around 200k per year.

fs103p,norcaltemp,Sanity check: I've been thinking of refinancing for months. Can someone tell me if I'm being stupid?,"TL;DR: I'm 2 years into a 15-year mortgage on a 4-unit property I live alone in. I've long been considering refinancing to a 30-year to reduce my monthly payments, and think now might as well be a good time to pull the trigger. I've only ever had this one mortgage, and I've never refinanced before. PersonalFinance has taught me a lot, so I was hoping someone could tell me if I'm being dumb.

I bought my house in Dec 2017, purchase price $385,000, and I put 20% down on a 15 year mortgage at an interest rate of 3.625%. My payments are $2480/month. I owe $271,000 as of today. For whatever it's worth, Zillow values the house at $405,000. I'll probably die in this house, but I probably still have 20-40 years to go.

The house is split into 4 units. If I rented them out, the units would pull in $800 each ($1200 with some remodeling). My original vision when I bought the house was to live in one of the units and rent out the rest, but after moving in I saw that the whole property could use some serious updating. I really enjoying living in it alone right now while I take my time remodeling it. I can't afford to remodel it all at once, and at my current rate I expect it to take another 12-18 months. I'm okay with this.

(I've never remodeled before, either, so I'm learning as I go. I'm old and slow, but trying to do as much on my own as I can, so gimme a break.) ;-)

Today, my net income is about $10K/month, so I can easily take on the mortgage without renters and pay for the remodel over time out of pocket. I'm going to face a loss of about 50-60% of my income in the next 3-5 years, so I'm trying to plan for that \*now\*. I'll be ""okay"" if I do nothing. But I'd like to be ""okay-er"".

So I've been thinking about refinancing the house with a 30-year mortgage. I know I'll pay more in the long run, but I like the idea of having additional breathing room for my monthly mortgage payment. The freed-up cash each month would speed up the remodel, and when I do finally rent out the extra units, the difference will make for a larger month-to-month income stream. (Right?)

I'm also considering taking out cash on the refi in order to help pay for the remodeling all at once, and possibly to invest some in another business. This option sounds the most attractive. While the interest rates will be higher with a cash out refi, they're still lower than taking out a separate loan for that cash.

Is there something I'm missing or not considering? Am I dumb for going through with this?",5,1585608054,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fs103p/sanity_check_ive_been_thinking_of_refinancing_for/,personalfinance,1
fs103h,whatsforlunch09,Take severance or work as part time contractor?,"Hello,

I was laid of this morning like many others due to Covid-19 affecting the business. I'm in Los Angeles.

1) My company is offering 3 week severance pay, $6,239 pre-tax. (Around **$4,367** after 30% tax)

Or

2) They are offering a contract position for 15 hrs a week for 2 months, which comes down to $9,600 pre-tax. (Around **$5,760** after 40% tax for freelancing)

If I take the contract role, I won't be getting the severance and the difference between the two options is around $1,400. 

My thought is I could take the 3 week severance and file for unemployment benefits and work on my design portfolio while looking for jobs with no distraction. I also have other freelance gig occasionally but not at the moment.

On the other hand, I technically have a job on paper while applying for new jobs, which could be beneficial in the next two months. But literally nobody is hiring and I believe I can't get unemployment benefits after the contract is over I believe.

Should I take the severance or keep working as part time contractor for 2 months?

As-is we will still save like $200-some per month with the refinance, versus what we are paying now. Our appraisal came back way over what we paid for the house and now mortgage guy is offering to lower the loan amount to avoid the $83/month PMI,  if we pay the difference in payoff of the current loan  ($3k) plus the ""prepaid items."" He estimates total cost to arrange this new loan will be $6.5-7.5k (including the 3k payoff).

What is the advantage of paying $7k and getting rid of the $83/month PMI? Either way our monthly payment is lower than before we set out to to refinance. We can afford the extra $83/month in PMI, but I get that it's money we're ""wasting"" since it's a like a penalty fee.

fs089m,IncompetentWaffle,Is this an appropriate time to negotiate a raise?,"I work in a skilled trade. I’ve been with the company for 5 years. Last Friday the owner called an all hands and laid off the entire staff with the exception of me and three others (all of whom have been there for 20+ years). I was kept on as a department lead to wrap up a few projects, we expected it would take roughly two weeks to complete but the scope of the work has recently expanded so it looks like it’ll take about 6 more months to finish. 

I like my job, but my salary is on the lower end of the spectrum as far as market rates are considered. 

With this new stimulus bill I’d be making more money sitting at home and collecting unemployment than by going to work. I understand it’s only a four month provision and I honestly don’t want to be sitting at home if I can be at work because I like what I do but I still feel like there might be an opportunity to start a conversation about my salary.  

The company is solvent.

fs02g8,JapaneseSubmarine,"Refinancing from 5.6% FHA to 2.6% conventional, no-brainer but need some advice!","Looking into refi from current $153,500 balance (FHA 30 year, 5.6%) into conventional 15 year @ 2.625%. I am locked in at this rate but having trouble with the new balance and closing costs. Proposed new loan would be for $161,200 and if you subtract the original loan and the new balance you arrive at $7700 so you assume that is closing costs. There is also the $1800 fee they are charging me for the rate deduction (discount fee) to get to a 2.625% interest. Altogether on the disclosures it is showing $8,989 to close and that $7,530 of that is financed so I'm paying $1,459 cash to close. The loan officer said I'm only paying the appraisal out of pocket which was $550. So I'm not sure where the other $1,000 figures - should I ask about this?

The total APR is 3.036%, and the TIP is 21.113%.

Obviously anything is better than my current abhorrent loan. But closing sounds high, and rolling it in sounds like a bad decision. I have the cash to pay everything out of pocket to keep my loan balance at $153,000 as it currently is with my current lender. Is this almost always advisable or is rolling it in better? Also important is that I PLAN to have the house paid in 5 years with additional payments MONTHLY. This would mean in 5 years I would only pay $10,461 in interest on the $153k balance, or $10,986 in interest on the $161k balance. However I am also paying 54 dollars more a month on the higher balance loan which after 5 years is $3,240 more than the lower balance loan.

My biggest concern is whether refinancing should typically maintain your current loan balance or is it routine to have closing rolled in, thus ending up with a new loan balance HIGHER than what you currently owe on your existing mortgage? Is rolling in advised, as the interest saved with such a lower rate worth saving the cash you would otherwise have to spend up front to close? Or is best to put whatever you can into refi so your balance is lower?

I may be overthinking everything; I just know how scummy direct lenders can be (my credit is not prime for a bank loan, right at 700).

I am above the maximum income to take a deduction for both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA.  I am thus considering doing a backdoor Roth IRA, as was recommended by this site.

I started this process by opening a traditional IRA and contributing $6000 of post-tax income.  Again, I did not deduct this $6000.  It's just cash, so I didn't have any gains to this $6000.  This is my only traditional IRA.  Now I want to convert this $6000 to a Roth IRA.  Do I have to pay tax on this $6000?

Also, $6000 is the legal limit for how much to contribute to a Roth IRA to this method too, right?

I have recently started saving money. The automated transfer at the end of the month has helped me immensely to stop spending money. 

Right now they are sitting is in a different chequing account. I want to take next step and have automated transfer to some sort of investment - where it makes me money. I want to make sure that there is minimal risk.

My bank offers me 0.3% interest rate (CIBC in Canada). But I think this is below the inflation rate. From my reading it seems I should buy bonds instead so that I’m not losing money.

&gt;First and foremost, we hope you and your family are safe and well. We understand the impacts that Coronavirus (COVID-19) is causing and we appreciate your patience while waiting on our response. Most customers are contacting us to request 90 day forbearance protections. As such, we have updated your account to reflect that you are impacted by COVID-19 and have applied the protections below to your account and no additional action is required on your part. If you were contacting us for another reason, and were not requesting payment relief due to COVID-19, we apologize, and please respond back to this email so we can adjust your account and assist you with your request.  Important things we would like to share with you: 

* If you are able to make your mortgage or home equity payments you should.
* If you are unable to make your mortgage payment and have automatic payment set up through Chase or another institution please stop those scheduled payments

&gt; We are providing the following protections on your loan for 90 days: 

* We will not charge late fees
* We will not report late payments to the credit-reporting agencies, but previously reported information will not change. As a general rule, we will resume regular credit reporting at the end of the 90 day protection period and any late payments may be reported at that time
* If your property is occupied, we will not start or continue any foreclosure actions during this time
* We will not place collection calls or mail collection letters but we will contact a customer if they miss a payment during the protection period to determine how we can assist them

&gt;Please also note: 

* When your relief period ends, any missed payments will be due. We'll be in touch to explain options that may be available for you to repay these amounts
* If you applied for other assistance from us, we will cancel that review so that you can take advantage of this program
* If you are in bankruptcy, please talk to your attorney or trustee about participation in this program",4,1585603687,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frznl1/contacted_mortgage_company_for_main_house_and/,personalfinance,1

frzk3r,thaatpoppunkguy,Should I take advantage of this student loan interest deferral?,"Hi PF! 

Forgive me if there's already a thread on this (or similar), but I searched and couldn't find one. 

I have \~$30k in student loans and \~$5k in high interest credit card debt. Because of consolidation efforts on my part, most of my CC debt is sitting at a promo rate of 0% across two cards. Once the promo period ends, the interest is \~16-17% One of those cards has \~$2,700 and the promo rate ends at the end of April. 

My student loan interest rate is usually \~4%. I've only been paying the minimum on my loans while I pay down my credit cards, so have not really been making much progress in terms of paying them off (I'm basically paying $106 a month and accruing $105 a month in interest). I know that's bad. Credit cards have been my priority. 

I've been paying $700 a month on my credit cards while I have these promo rates and have made incredible progress on my credit card debt (it started close to $15k)

Here's my question - knowing that I have 0% interest on my loans for the next 6 months because of the recently passed COVID law, does it make sense for me to take advantage of this and pay the minimum (or just over the minimum) on my cards and pay the $700 a month on my loans? Or should I just keep trucking along on my cards to avoid the high interest from really affecting me?

I think I provided all of the info you should need to help me, but let me know if I forgot anything. I almost always do. lol

frzi74,steve_togo,Wash Sale Rules on an IRA,"Hi,

Based on the below.

""Wash sale applies when you sell in a taxable account for a loss. You would not be able to claim that loss if you buy a ""substantially similar"" investment in any account type as the loss you wish to claim in taxable.""

&amp;#x200B;

So If I were to sell a stock for a loss in my traditional IRA and buy the same stock in my ROTH IRA how would that work, I understand I can transfer securities, but there is always the risk of price change as they take the value on Dec 31st.

&amp;#x200B;

frzcij,simianrexjr,High School Senior Considering College Options,"I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this; if this isn't, please tell me!

I was lucky (and privileged) enough to be able to apply and be accepted to a few colleges this application cycle. I have narrowed my list down to two schools: Dartmouth College and Mercer University.

Dartmouth College is a more prestigious school by far, but the cost of attending the college would be close to $50000 a year for my parents with financial aid (I am going to try to appeal), which they said they can pay, but I find extremely high. On the other hand, Mercer University is a lesser-ranked school, but I was awarded the Stamps Scholarship, which gives me a full ride, and is only awarded to 5 students. 

I plan on majoring in biomedical engineering, as well as studying geography (most likely a minor). My parents are saying that Dartmouth College is a much better option because of its name recognition, but in all honesty we are all extremely confused as I am the first in my family to attend a college in the West and we don't know the system very well. I plan on going on to graduate or professional school after my undergraduate, but may not do it right away, and have a job for a few years first living with my parents to save some money. 

Dartmouth College has been a dream school for me, and I was incredibly happy to be accepted. However, is it better for me in the long run to go to Mercer? Mercer seems more financially prudent, but the connections I would make at Dartmouth may help a lot in the long run. I'm incredibly lucky to even be in this situation, but I'm not sure what to do next.",7,1585602657,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frzcij/high_school_senior_considering_college_options/,personalfinance,1

I'm gonna be honest with you, I made the mistake of being really dumb and ignorant and not even thinking about contributing to my retirement plan at the time because I thought I didn't need to do it during my mid-20's. I just turned 27 earlier this year and it wasn't until my own dad had to talk to me about how I shouldn't be wasting a big opportunity later in my life like that.

So I contacted his own financial advisor, and they suggested that I initially put in 25% into a Roth IRA account, which is going to start happening on my next paycheck. I'm currently still living with my parents since we're in the same city so I have quite a bit saved in my bank savings account(a little over 30k) right now anyway, just never bothered to invest in anything until now. My current salary is a modest 45k (I work at a non-profit) for anyone curious.

I wanted to know if I'm way behind the curve compared to my peers and if I have a lot of catching up to do? And if so, what else I may need to do.

frypbt,rahmanhaf,Lost my tax IP PIN for 2019 tax filing (changed my address),"

Hi,
   I received an IP PIN CP01A notice from the IRS for last year's tax filing purposes, which I had to use while filing my Federal taxes in 2018. I moved across states last Nov and I specifically remember getting my address changed with the USPS since I got a lot of forward emails from my old address to the new one. 

The issue is: I didn't receive the CP01A notice for 2019 tax filing year through mail and I am unable to use the online tool on the IRS website to retrieve my lost IP PIN number as it is unable to verify that my mobile phone number is registered in my name (which is weird). For users who are unable to register online, IRS provides an option to register through a code that will be sent by mail to the address on file. But are the offices open to send these letters? Or would the mailing of such letters get delayed too due to the recent shutdown (covid reason)? I have been trying to call them on their helpline for IP PIN but it goes to an automated response which says ""services are temporarily suspended"" :( 

Anyone have an idea whether I will still be able to receive letters from the IRS during this period? Also, if I file through mail without my IP PIN, does it get rejected? Or will there just be delays but will eventually get processed without any issues if someone files his federal tax return without the assigned IP PIN number?",4,1585600517,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frypbt/lost_my_tax_ip_pin_for_2019_tax_filing_changed_my/,personalfinance,1

fryebd,throwaway19471290,Lowering interest expense?,"I have some questions related to lowering my interest expense for my credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial info:

* I currently have just under $12,000 in credit card debt
* My cards have a $12,000 limit total so I'm maxed out
* I have no other debt
* My credit score is just under 700
* My total monthly debt payments are $190 ($20 in mandatory payments + around $170 in interest \[20% APR\])
* Other monthly expenses are $260 (so total expenses per month are around $450)
* I have around $2000 across my chequing and savings accounts
* I recently started a new job and my monthly income is currently $1200, so I have $750 that I can put towards paying off my debt every month (1200-190-260=750)

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

I was thinking of using the strategy of applying for credit cards with promotions for 0% interest for x number of months for balance transfers so that I could reduce my interest expense and pay off my debt faster. I do not want another credit card so that I can spend more but strictly so that I can save money on interest through a balance transfer promotion.

1. From the first day that I started working, how long should I wait before applying for a credit card? (after first 2-week pay cheque, 30 days, 90 days, other?)
2. What are the chances that I would be approved for another credit card?
3. Do any other options such as a LOC or personal loan make sense, or are 0% balance transfer promotions the ideal option for me?",6,1585599539,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fryebd/lowering_interest_expense/,personalfinance,1
frycz9,macher52,Care Act Question,"From what I understand you have the opportunity to take $100k from your 401k and either convert it to a Roth or use it for something else with no penalty. I can easily prove that COVID 19 has affected my income. The only caveat is for 3 years the $100k is spread out and added to your AGI. 

Here’s my situation. I’m 53 years old married. I have $145k in my 403b. We have $100k left on our mortgage with 20 years to go @ 5%, mortgage payment is $725 / month. We also have a rental property with a $71k mortgage on for 15 years, mortgage payment is $575 / month. 

Our plan is to move into the rental because expenses are much lower than the house we are in now. The plan was 2 years. 

What are your thoughts on paying off the $100k mortgage? The house is worth at least $150k maybe up to $160k. 

Was also thinking taking the $725 mortgage payment and contributing to a Roth.

Just as friends/relatives/acquaintances warned:  we are out of the honeymoon phase, and although we still very much adore each other (some days)... We CANNOT agree on what caliber of house we should be looking at.

My husband is a small business owner who is obsessed with making money... but not very obsessed with parting with it (which I completely understand &amp; appreciate!). We both agree that it's time to move out of our crappy rental house since our landlord has spontaneously decided to increase rent while refusing to fix anything (we no longer have a functional bathroom sink and the place is infested with ants... but that's a story for another day). So we began our house hunt and quickly ran into some road blocks.

My husband, who hates debt, seems to think we should buy one that we can pretty much pay cash for. He thinks spending $40,000 on a house sounds like plenty. While housing is relatively inexpensive in our area, that price point is still much too tight to find anything that isn't ready to cave in. We are way too busy and not handy enough for a fixer upper.

**I am clearly NOT financially literate, so I struggle to hold up an in an argument. But I know that ""normal"" people have mortgages. He seems to think he is outsmarting everyone by spending as little as he can on housing. Help me out here!**

(I think including our financial situation might be helpful): 

* Partner makes around 75k annually (self-employed, still growing his business). 
* He has some operating debt sometimes, but no ""real"" debt.
* We own both of our vehicles.
* I have a good credit score (he doesn't have a credit score since he insists on paying cash for everything)
* I work part time (\~10k a year which all goes toward books, gas, tuition, groceries, etc.)
* I am in professional school currently; will have 120k in school debt. *I should make at least 70k starting; job outlook is good.*

Since I had a good amount of time until my work started, I got a headstart on looking for places to rent out. 

So on March 10th, I signed and deposited money for a lease starting in May (I'm ok with paying the full month of May even though I would only come near the end of it). I got a really good deal because it was a lease takeover, and the student living there right now gave me a discount on it (she paid the company 600$ and I paid 900$ towards the deposit). The deposit was for the first and last month.

Now Covid-19 came, and my company pushed back the start date to July 1st. This isn't a huge issue, and I don't mind having to pay the first month just so everything is easier, but there is a very good chance that my internship will be delayed even further (maybe to August) which is also when my lease ends. 

I was also hoping to renew the lease later on as well because my internship is 12 months, but if my work gets delayed to August, I don't know what to do with the lease because I signed all the papers and paid the deposit. I really don't want to pay for the lease if I'm not living there, and I also don't want to screw over the student that I took the lease over from. What do I do?

TL;DR: Got a lease takeover for 4 months starting May 1st. She paid 600$ and I paid 900$ to the deposit, I signed the lease.

frxdqu,kakers43,How to raise my score from 586?,"
Hello, long time lurker first time poster. I have some work to do on my credit. 
Current Score: Experian FICO 8 586. TransUnion and Equifax are about the same. 
Accounts, 4:
	1.	Revolving account, capital 1 credit card: 1915/2100, reported 2/27/20. My most recent statement now has the balance at 1200/2100 (I’m throwing all the money I can at this) but has not reported yet to credit bureaus. I am current on my account, but had late payments 3/19, 4/19, 5/19, 6/19, 7/19, 8/19 due to a job loss. One additional late payment 5/17 but other than that, on time payments every month since May 2013. I sent a letter to Capital One asking to have my late payments removed due to hardships with the current pandemic affecting my ability to get a loan. 
	2.	Car Loan: 4000 left on a 16000 loan, opened Jan 2015. Perfect payment history. Last reported 12/2019, my account is now down to 3000 remaining. 
	3.	Car Loan: opened June 2013, perfect payment history, closed July 2017
	4.	Student Loans: opened 2009, 60000, current, no late payment but currently closed as I’m in school full time (to advance my job) in addition to my career.

Derogatory Account:
Car loan opened 11/2014, closed 8/2015 as bad debt, amount owed 2500 

Collections: 0 (I was able to dispute the 3 medical debts and they were all removed) one collections debt after it was removed recently dropped my score by 40 points...

So apart from trying to get my credit card company to remove the late payments, and paying down my credit card, do y’all have any suggestions as to what else I can do to boost my credit? I have guaranteed job security (work in healthcare) so my income will stay pretty steady throughout the COVID 19 crisis. I opened up an account through Self for a “loan” that has yet to report. 
Should I try to open up a secured credit card? No clue what else to do.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, if it's not ill take this down right away. Basically I took out a stupid high-interest loan.

Next wednesday(March 18) I was planning on paying the two missed payments, but that monday(March 16). I wake up to find my car gone. They towed it. This is 100% my fault, I made silly choices and I made uneducated assumptions such as they have to send you a letter or something before they can tow your car. Naturally, I want my car back, so I call Honda Finance(the institution the car was loaned from) and after speaking to a representative they are 100% adamant that they will not give me my car back unless i pay them 27k by April 2. Otherwise theyll take the car to auction, sell it, and Ill have to pay whatever is left. I do not have 27k. Because my car was towed no financial institution is willing to loan me money. I just really want my car back and I need somebodys advice. As of right now, Im trying to speak to some uncles and see if they are willing to take out a loan and I pay them back, but Im also want to hear if anyone here has any advice.

frwyr0,FoldagerJR,"First time business owner, ""accidentally"" forgot to set aside for tax","Hi r/personalfinance  


As the title says, I have ""accidentally"" forgotten to set aside for my taxes.  
I have been running my small one-person consulting business since last spring, with the same single customer. I was told that they would expect to need my help until at least August this year. I had a lot of things that I needed to take care of late last year, meaning I had a lot of expenses.  
This was nothing luxurious, yet I paid with some money that I knew I was going to have to pay in taxes about this time. But this was not a problem, I would just set aside   
Enter, COVID19. They no longer feel like they can afford me due to a natural fall in their sales, and therefore I am without any income. Since I am a consultant with no contract on the hours, being ""fired"" can occur with a minutes notice.  
Luckily, I still have three unpaid invoices from Jan, Feb and March, that are yet to hit my account, which is enough for last years taxes which is about 17.000 USD.  
However, I will still have to pay off the 45% from these past months this time next year (Danish taxation).  


My game plan right now is to search for any work, offering the company that I can go on, on a much lower salary, as I just need to work off what would otherwise be debt next year.  
I am currently selling all the stuff I don't need, switching to cheaper clothes, and I have cut back on ALL expenses, leaving me living for as little as possible.

I am beginning my bachelor after the summer, which is luckily free as I live in Denmark, and I get paid to study as all students here do, thus I can still try to live for as little as possible while working it off.  


What would you suggest that I do in the situation I in reality pretty much put myself in?  


TL:DR - Didnt set aside for taxes, lost only client and source of income due to COVID19 lockdown,  aim to work off my 8.000 USD taxes for next year before summer.

 \- What is the difference between asset value and cash equivalent? For example, if an individual puts $1,000 from his checking account into Account A, does this increase the total value or cash value?

 \- How much money should this individual invest in these funds given the above assumptions and how should he choose the funds to invest in? Given the current volatility of the markets, does it make sense to \*\*not\*\* transfer any money from his checking account to either Account A or Account B?

At first, I thought it was a mistake so I filed again after double-checking everything, but rejected again. I tried calling the IRS, but with Covid-19 going on right now, it's difficult to get someone on the phone.  I filed last year and everything was processed through just fine.

frvsqm,PsychiatricWonder,Please help my understand my loan denial,"Hey, all.

My partner and I are trying to finance a used car because mine has bitten the dust.

Here’s a quick rundown of our finances:

Partner: Makes about $47k/year. 

$60k in student debt (banker told us this will not affect loan decision because it’s in deferment?)

$3600 of unused credit cards. He has no credit card debt.

Credit score of 790.

Me: Make $12k/year. Graduate student. 

A disgusting $137k in student debt, also in deferment. 

$5000 in card debt, $1600 available

Credit score of 711.

Rent is only $400/month and we do not have any other debts. 

Now, we figured the loan process would be questionable because of our student debt, but the banker (loan officer?) at our credit union said it should be okay. I will add, she wasn’t very informative, hence this post.

For this loan, she said we should apply with my partner as the primary, and me as the secondary/co-signer, so we did. 

We were denied for the following reasons: percentage of revolving credit is too low, insufficient credit history (we’re both 30 and have had these cards for years with the oldest opened when I was 18), proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high (she said this wasn’t because of student debt??), length of time revolving accounts have been established, no recent bank card balances, lack of recently-reported revolving account balances.

Again, she was not good about answering our questions.

We recently finished paying off ALL of my partner’s cards, and 2 of mine, and have barely been using them. Is this part of the issue?

How much is student debt hurting us? Are we going to be denied for all loans until the debt is gone/we die?

Should we be applying without my credit on the application? We’ve been “prequalified” for other loans, but I don’t know if that will turn into a denial once our credit is pulled.

What do we do from here?",19,1585591505,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frvsqm/please_help_my_understand_my_loan_denial/,personalfinance,1

Normally, the 15-year option would be a no brainer for me because the extra $200 is manageable and I'd be saving $6K more in interest compared to the 20-year option.

I am in the State of California, and have a high paying tech-job.

I have an 'annual review meeting' with my manager/HR, this week, after numerous bad performance conversations, and I suspect I will be either terminated, or given a performance improvement plan.

This annual review is being given to all employees at the company, this month, but they don't usually include HR, and are usually just with your manager. 

(The HR/Manager meeting is all being done virtually/remote, since we are working from home due to the virus situation)

The meeting has been booked for 90 minutes. 

My manager told me this would be coming, and that sometimes annual reviews involve HR, which is why I suspect I am being given a 30 day PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), and after that period, I will be canned. However, what I need to know, is whether I am being terminated on the spot. (i.e. this week)

I am also curious, why they booked the meeting for 90 minutes. I realize it's an annual review, and usually takes time, but wanted to get everyone's insight here.

**Do you think I will be terminated on the spot, or given a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan)? My company's revenue has not been hit at all by the virus situation, and they are actually making more money, so they aren't laying people off. But performance concerns have come up, even a couple months before this virus thing started.** 

My understanding however, is that now due to coronavirus, unemployment is being allocated an additional $600/week.

**I am wondering, is this additional $600 a week, for the coronavirus situation, only applicable to those that are laid-off, or is also applicable for those that are fired for poor performance, despite trying their best?**",16,1585590918,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frvloi/am_i_being_terminated_or_will_i_receive_a/,personalfinance,1

A lot of y'all are smart, experienced, and eloquent when it comes to personal finances. Some have been through recessions (2008, 2000, 1980s, etc.) and other drops in the market. You're in a position of strength in an uncertain time. 

But, most of the world isn't like you. They're scared and looking for answers and coming to this sub to find them.

I challenge you to use what knowledge and experience you have to help them!

For the past two weeks, I've spent an hour or so every day going through NEW. It's overflowing with folks getting laid off, questioning a job change, considering liquidating their 401Ks, being bullied by a debt collector, and many, many more relatively straight forward financial questions. But, being NEW, most of these will never make it to our front page your personal feed and so getting the answers they're looking for can be hard. Add to this the fact that these are questions the sub has answered thousands of times, and a lot of these questions can get ignored or lost in the onslaught of NEW.

These aren't the normal subscribers asking the same questions they should be learning about from the sidebar, these are folks who aren't sure where to turn to and are looking for some experts to help them out. That's where you come in.

I challenge you, if you're doing well financially in these unstable times, to share your experience and knowledge by spending a little time every day in NEW answering the top handful of questions that pop up. 

You'll end up answering a lot of basic financial questions repeatedly and asking a lot of clarifying questions, but also you'll end up helping a lot of folks who are scared and don't know where to turn. Even better, your advice may be what they need to start on a journey toward true financial health. 

So, if you can, spend a little time helping out these folks who are suddenly flooding to Reddit looking for answers. You'll likely be a huge help to them in their time of need.",1,1585590815,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frvkj7/hey_rpf_veterans_i_challenge_you_to_share_your/,personalfinance,1

frvhdb,HistoricalZoidberg,Question about buying out my car lease (first car purchase),"Hey everyone, I hope this is a good place to ask this, but if not feel free to delete this!  My car lease is about to end in May and I'm stuck between turning in the lease and getting a new lease or buying a new car OR just buying out this lease outright.  Here is some background information

The lease is a 2017 Toyota Camry.  I paid 0 drive off and only about 200/month so I feel like I got a solid deal on the lease.  I really do love this car.  The only thing about it that I'd really want in a newer model is adaptive cruise control and Apple Car Play.  However, I'm iffy about purchasing a new car just for those two things.  I leased it for 36k Miles and I drove only about 15K of it and it'll be about 16k at the end of the lease.  At the start of the lease I scraped the side of the back bumper..not too bad but enough that I know returning it will result in some extra charges.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently there are the options I see in front of me and I was hoping to get advice as to what some of you might do in the same situation

&amp;#x200B;

1. Buy out the lease at the end.  The payout amount is going to be something like 14.7K.  And just purchase aftermarket mods to add Apple Carplay.  I'm thinking this might be the cheapest option just because I don't know how good of a deal I can get on a similar used car with low mileage.
2. Return the lease for a new Toyota lease.  I'll avoid the disposition fee, get a new lease, but I'll also have to pay for the bumper damage and continue to lease instead of purchasing
3. Return the lease and buy a used car.  I'll pay the disposition fee (unless I guess I buy used from Toyota), pay for the bumper damage, and be able to put money towards something I own.  My only concern is I don't know if I'll get the same price for a car like mine that has low mileage and I know who the driver was.",6,1585590544,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frvhdb/question_about_buying_out_my_car_lease_first_car/,personalfinance,1

I apologise if this has been asked already million times. Didn't see anything specific to my concerns.

We would be buying at a peak in the market obviously but with rates being so low, does it make sense to sell now to cash out on my current home, lock in a super low rate, and buy our forever home? I know buying high isn't the best financial move but if the perfect house showed up, I'd hate to miss out obviously. 

My wife and I have high job security throughout all the craziness and FICO scores above 770 so locking in a low rate shouldn't be an issue and risk is low.

I have really been putting off any budgeting or financial planning for a while now, but due to the free time created by the global crisis... I decided now would be a good time to get it all together.

I am 21 years old and a little more than half-way through a gap year of college. I work different types of jobs that bring in different levels of pay so it's difficult for me to track my monthly income. But on the yearly side it comes out to 10k-12k a year. I'm extremely fortunate that I have a deal with a landlord where I only pay utilities every month, which is about 120$. I have few other payments that are recurring,  because my family is still able to cover car and health insurance. In total looking at past credit transactions I usually end up spending around 600$ -800$ per month. Currently to my name I have:
-2,500$ in a student savings that has a 3% interest rate as long as I keep it under 3,000$
-1,300 in a checking account.

What should my next steps be for planning ahead for the future beyond just cutting costs of things I don't need.

frutva,Cooperbaby90,Rollover 403b in current climate," 

Hey  all, so I recently quit my job to go back to school. I have a 403b plan  and a 401a plan from my old employer with a good amount of money in it  (they wont make me mandatory cash it out.) I'm basically in the mutual  funds that track the dow jones and S&amp;P 500.

I  was reading that you can ask that they send you a check for the value  of your stocks, to be used within 60 days to deposit into a IRA or  similar account.

I'm thinking  right now that I would benefit, if I could rollover and effectively sell  my stocks at the current down jones level of 22000. And hold onto my  check. And when the dow jones goes backdown  to 18000 I could then invest in, and get in at a lower price. I think that it will go down again as they keep saying that we havent hit the peak yet.

Does that sound correct? And is there any fees or penalties for doing something like that?",5,1585588449,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frutva/rollover_403b_in_current_climate/,personalfinance,1

frusok,throwaway19471290,Looking for credit card debt advice,"I'm looking for some advice on how I can lower my interest expenses for my credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Financial info:

* I currently have just under $12,000 in credit card debt
* My cards have a $12,000 limit total so I'm maxed out
* I have no other debt
* My credit score is just under 700
* My total monthly debt payments are $190 ($20 in mandatory payments + around $170 in interest \[20% APR\])
* Other monthly expenses are $60 (so total expenses per month are around $250)
* I have around $2000 across my chequing and savings accounts
* Monthly income is currently $0 (and has been $0 for the past 12 months)
* I'm assuming that I will start to work part-time within the next 4 months
* Once I start working, my monthly income would increase to at least $1200 and my monthly expenses would increase by around $200, leaving me with an extra $750 to put towards paying off my credit card debt (after taking into account current debt payments \[1200-200-250=750\])

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

I was thinking of using the strategy of applying for credit cards with promotions for 0% interest for x number of months for balance transfers so that I could reduce my interest expense. I do not want another credit card so that I can spend more but strictly so that I can save money on interest through a balance transfer promotion.

1. If I were to apply now (when my income is $0), what are the chances that I would be approved for another credit card that requires $0 in income, given my current financial situation?
2. Should I apply now or wait until I start working?
3. Once I start working, how long should I wait before applying for another credit card? (after first 2-week pay cheque, 30 days, 90 days, other?)
4. Do any other options such as a LOC or personal loan make sense, or are 0% balance transfer promotions the ideal option for me, given my current financial situation?",18,1585588345,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frusok/looking_for_credit_card_debt_advice/,personalfinance,1

Wanted to get your thoughts on this on if it would be appropriate to increase contributions to 401K or ESPP? Currently, I have about 5% going into 401k which maxes out employer contribution, 2% going into ESPP which automatically nets me 15% profit (able to purchase stock at 15% discount). I also have roughly 4.5% going into a cash savings account to continue to grow cash reserves. I don't have a full six months emergency fund (At roughly three months) but my spouses income can be used to grow that. 

My current work situation and my spouses is extremely stable despite these crazy times and I am able to 100% WFH for the foreseeable future. Extremely lucky in that regard. Having said all that, I feel that this is possibly the time to increase contribution to my 401k considering the market is a low point. I am 29 so I think I can afford some risk in that regard to grow that fund.

Options that I am considering:

* Increase contribution to 401k fund
* Increase contribution to ESPP

frud05,SqueakyLycan,Going back to renting after owning a home. Thoughts?,"Just mulling this idea around... I wish I would have asked this pre-coronavirus, but alas, I'm at least using my time at home to think ahead about my future. Mods, I know the rule about 'no relationship advice' but I promise I'm just trying to frame this from a financial standpoint. 

To keep this short: 

* I own my home (purchased in 2016 for about 90k). My mortgage just went up to $808/mo. 
* I live alone, but am in a relationship with my boyfriend who lives about an hour away. After some terse conversations and us both getting some perspective about our careers, we both really think it is smart (for the time being, anyway) to keep our current jobs based on our respective training and promotions.  
* Therefore in the interest of moving our relationship forward, obviously we need to live together. He rents one half of a duplex about an hour away from me, at $600/mo, utilities covered. He's 5 minutes from his job. I'm 26-30 minutes from mine currently. 
* Being that I luckily still have my job during the pandemic, I'm able to keep working and pay my bills. He doesn't necessarily want to move into my house with me (we haven't been dating SUPER long and we want to be more certain that things will last/we're meant to be), and I don't want to move to his part of town because it's way more rural and I'd have a 1.25 hour commute each way to work if I moved. 

So... 

I've been thinking we could rent a home together somewhere roughly in between our workplaces.

He has more to lose if he moves into my house with me. I'm not hellbent on staying in my home, but it sure seems like a huge financial loss if I were to sell an asset I have equity in (albeit not much) and go back to renting. I know this means I could save some money month to month on things like home improvement, etc. BUT... for the sake of moving my relationship forward in a way that means compromise is roughly equal for both partners, is this a terrible idea? 

Have any of you happy couples had to do something like this? Is it a financial deathtrap, or (the way I see it), is it a good way to test the waters without screwing myself or him in case our relationship doesn't last for good? If anything, if my rent ends up being less than my mortgage... and we live under the same roof... we could both be stocking away a few hundred more a month together than we are currently (living separately).

fruc78,soymasguapo,buy a vacation home for personal use / income generation,"Hi All, 

Really struggling with whether or not it's a wise move for our family to purchase a rental home on the texas gulf coast.  At the end of the day, the property will just about pay for itself - maybe a little in the red, maybe a little in the green.  I'd like to present the facts and get some feedback on whether or not I'm making a dumb move by taking on more debt.  

**INCOME / PERSONAL FINANCE:**

\- My base salary is $130K per year, which is a net amount of around $7,474 per month

\- I do get commission and bonus throughout the year, but I'd rather not count on it for this.  For the record, my 2019 monthly GROSS average was $5,798.  My 2018 monthly GROSS average was $10,833.  I anticipate that 2020 will be a great year since my industry gets a boost from the COVID-19 ordeal.  

\- My wife stays home with our two boys - 3 and 6 years old.  She can make money in real estate, but isn't doing so right now.  If the going gets tough - she essentially has plenty of jobs waiting for her. 

\- We have about $175K in cash and liquid assets like REITs, cryptos, individual stocks, cash, etc. on hand, which is OUTSIDE of what we have in 401K, IRAs, etc.  I'm not even factoring in any of the funds we have in retirement accounts.  

&amp;#x200B;

**MONTHLY COST OF LIVING:**

\- Our total monthly cost of living is around $7,480 per month.  You might notice this is close to my monthly income after taxes from base salary.  This is by design.  It makes me feel good knowing that I don't need commission payments and bonuses to survive.  

\- If we do purchase a second home, I will make some cuts to our current cost of living.  I can lower our monthly cost of living down to $5,945 by doing the following:  driving a cheaper car, refi my current home mortgage which is at 4.25% and only four years old (assuming I can get 3.25 or better on a rate), no gym memberships, pay off $14K in high interest debt that costs a lot of money on a monthly basis. 

&amp;#x200B;

**DETAILS ON SECOND HOME:**

\- House will be between $430K-$450K.  Total monthly cost to own the home is $3,050 per month on a 30 year mortgage, including taxes, insurance, HOA fees, utilities, minor maintenance, etc. 

\- This home is in a hot spot for short term/vacation rentals.  It has a documented history of producing income.  2019 gross rental income was $50K.  Let's call that $25K net after property management fees, cleaning fees, etc.  

\- The goal of owning the home isn't to rent it out 100% of the time.  The $50K in rental income for 2019 is mainly from the summer months and equates to about 30% occupancy over the course of a year.  Our goal is essentially to be able to make adjustments to our current budget, buy the home, rent it out enough to get us back to where we are today, and enjoy it for the rest of the time personally while we enjoy the tax benefits and hopefully the house appreciates in value as we also build equity through the loan.  

&amp;#x200B;

**IMPACT TO CASH ON HAND:**

\- After buying the home and paying down some debt, this will leave us with approx $75K cash on hand.

\- I should be able to continue to build a stronger cash position over the years, especially when my wife starts working again. 

&amp;#x200B;

**THE BIG ISSUE:**

\- The thing I have an issue with is that even after paying down some debt and refinancing my current home, once I add in the cost to own the second home, my monthly cost of living becomes about $9K per month.  $9K per month is about $1,500 more than what I'm paying today, and also about $1,500 per month more than what my base salary provides.  

\- Granted, this is where the short term rental on the second home comes in.  To break even, I'd need to rent it enough to GROSS about $30K per year annually.  Assuming I could take home 60% of that after property management fees, etc., this would bring me back to where I am today.  

\- Considering the home generated $50K in 2019, this leaves me with an additional $20K in gross revenue on the table I could take advantage of if we chose to.  

*Is it a dumb move to increase my monthly cost of living by $1,500 above my current monthly base salary, even though my wife can work if needed, the property itself will generate money, and I will most likely make more than enough bonus to cover it anyway?  Just seems risky to me.  Do the benefits outweigh the risks?*  

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate some honest and unbiased feedback.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks!",21,1585586907,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fruc78/buy_a_vacation_home_for_personal_use_income/,personalfinance,1

fru8vo,Local-Response,Family is pushing me towards college without a career plan.,"I’m unsure if this is the right subreddit to post in but I need some alternate opinions on whether or not I’m making the correct decision.

I’m currently 19 years old and I currently work in two separate jobs ever since I graduated from high school. My parents have been really adamant in me attending college ever since my final year in HS, but I did not want to go due in part to having no career path.

In my personal opinion, unless I were to go for a field such as nursing, engineering or a career that I believe will lead to steady employment, I’m not going to school.

Unfortunately, I was never a great student and it wasn’t for a lack of trying. I was diagnosed with aspergers and other mental disabilities, which made studying a challenge during high school. Because of this, I don’t consider myself to be really academically inclined for college in any shape or form.

Basically my schedule is like this; 

1). I have a day office job where I work from 8:30 to 4:30 PM. I have my own health insurance in case of any issues. It’s not bad but it’s repetitive data entry which I enjoy. It pays $16.75 an hour.

2). My second job I work from 9:30 PM to 2:00 AM at a warehouse. It only pays $12.00
an hour but it’s not far from home. The only downsides is that after working here for close to a year I’m feeling my body dealing with the effects.

All of my income goes to my family, with the exception of a savings account and some funds for myself when needed. I’m fairly frugal and don’t waste my money on entertainment.

I have taken career tests and unfortunately a lot of the careers I discovered don’t make much money. In regards to my goals I’m fairly simple;

1). I don’t want a relationship or my own family. I’ll take care of myself in my own apartment if I can afford it.

My family really wants me to attend college and while I understand where they’re coming from, I’m against just getting a general studies degree which won’t lead anywhere.

I have lost my income as a contract recruiter. I currently have $3600.00 in monthly expenses. My mortgage is $1400.00 and is being serviced through Freedom Mortgage. I am currently on IL unemployment which nets around $800 a month after taxes. I was elated to hear Freedom mortgage offering forbearance to it's customers. Traditionally, the forbearance I am used to with private/federal student loans and a couple of my business loans has been to add the typical 3 month forbearance onto the end of the loan. I was horrified to see on Freedom Mortgage's website that :

"" **Forbearance is a temporary suspension of your mortgage payments, allowing you to remain in your home while working through your short-term financial challenges. We will suspend your payments for up to 3 months. At the conclusion of the forbearance period, all of your deferred payments will be due.** ""

If I am initially seeking forbearance because I cannot AFFORD to pay $1400.00 , what makes them think anyone seeking forbearance is going to be able to pay $4200 when the forbearance period ends?

The center confirmed these details, and they are sticking to their statement on their main page. Thank you Freedom mortgage for not giving a damn about your customers impacted during this terrible crisis.

fru24d,Coltfourty5,Mortgage Deferment question. I asked my bank lender if I could and got this response. I don't understand most of what they are saying.,"I work in hospitality and my hotel has shut down for at least 2 months and furloughed basically everyone.  I reached out to my lender to see about deferring my loan to help me through the coming months.  this is the response email I got and as someone who isn't very well versed in this stuff to begin with I'm confused as to what they are saying.

&amp;#x200B;

Lenders response:

""Hello, you are potentially eligible for a reduced or suspended three-month forbearance plan to borrowers negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. During this forbearance period, you have the option to suspend your payment entirely or you may make the escrow portion of your payment, which is currently $XXX.XX We strongly recommend you make the escrow portion of your payment as this will reduce the total delinquent amount you will owe following the forbearance plan. 

Your loan will not be reported to the credit bureaus while you are receiving assistance. Late charges will not accrue during the term of your plan.

At the end of the three month forbearance period, if you are unable to bring your loan current, you may be eligible for a repayment plan, in which you will pay your regular monthly payment plus a set fraction of the delinquency over a pre-determined number of months OR a deferment option, which will defer a set number of payments to the end of your loan, becoming due at maturity. Alternatively, you may qualify for a loan modification, which will add the total delinquency incurred during your forbearance plan to your Unpaid Principal Balance. The term of your mortgage will then be extended just long enough to cover the delinquent amount while maintaining the principal and interest portion of your payment at the current amount, or just slightly less.

If you wish to proceed, please advise and **complete/return the attached form**. We will also need to know if you are able to make the escrow portion of your payment during the forbearance period.""

I'm proficient in Microsoft office, Google docs, etc and honestly I can learn almost anything relatively quickly. 

In spite of all of this I'm continuously offered 12-13 per hour, which does not pay the bills in this area and feels downright insulting. I've been able to negotiate to $15 but honestly I feel I'm worth *at least* a few dollars more than that.

My name is Laurens, 22 yo and live in The Netherlands. Due to some unfortunate events and stupid decisions, I've managed to accumulate over  €10k+ in debt over the years. I've been paying them off seriously for about a year and managed to have about  €1.5k leftover debt.

Some info: I earn  € 2k after-tax a month, and my monthly expenses are around  €1100.

\- I have  €500,- worth in bitcoin at the moment and want to keep them for the long term

\- I have literally 0 savings due to monthly debt payments. I try to pay as much as possible.

My question is: Should I continue to pay my leftover 1.5k debt in one go? Or is it better to accumulate some savings and pay the debt off over the longer period?  I'm allowed to pay  €100,- every month so it's not an issue to pay it over the longer term.

I've called Vanguard several times and they always say I have to do it over the website, they can't help me on the phone.

My Wealthfront Roth IRA looks like this:

* Current account value: $5,659
* Holdings are: 14x VTI, 36x VEA, 21x VWO, 9x VNQ, 2x LQD, 10x EMB.
* Desired final holdings: some kind of 2060 target date fund. I don't know exactly what's available in Vanguard.

frtnyr,Jerronbao,Need Advice for Taking Time Off,"TL:DR  My employer has given everyone 2 weeks extra PTO to be used in case of shut down/sickness etc. This PTO is use it or lose it and everyone is taking it during the stay at home DIRECTIVE issued by our state. Should I use it now, or keep working until our State issues a more serious SHUT DOWN which would ensure I am still getting a check for a few weeks. I am the only person who came in today and am at no risk of spreading or contracting anything since I am here alone.

For a bit of background I work for a smaller company which builds and leases floor cleaning machines. Our total crew consists of 4 full time employees and 5 part-time employees. A few weeks ago my employer met with it's department managers and we discussed our strategies for confronting COVID-19. We decided that giving Full-Time Employees an additional 2 weeks of paid time off to be used in the event of a shutdown or in the event of being sick (Our regular PTO is paid out at the end of the year if unused, but this would just be lost if we don't use it). We also gave our part time employees 2 weeks of PTO if they needed it.  My state has recently issued a stay at home DIRECTIVE so we are still not at the point where we are being shut down. My work has given everyone the option to not come in this week and to use the extra PTO, however, if after 2 weeks we get a stay at home ORDER then we will have already used our 2 weeks extra PTO (which we lose if we don't use it). So anyway I came into work today and I am the only person here, I am not in danger of spreading anything and am not in danger of contracting anything. My question is am I better off taking my PTO which I will lose if I don't use it now, or should I wait it out in case we do get shut down a few weeks from now.

It would be pretty dumb if I kept working only for things to clear up a few weeks from now, and for me to make the same $$ as I would had I stayed home. 

Also as a side note, I do have a small emergency savings and food storage so if I were to go a few weeks without a paycheck it wouldn't be the end of the world.",0,1585584750,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frtnyr/need_advice_for_taking_time_off/,personalfinance,1

We are looking for some advice to make sure that we are doing what is in our best interest. Up until now, we were planning on doing a backdoor Roth IRA because our MAGI is around $201K or so for this year. Our tax preparer has however told us that we are not eligible to do a backdoor Roth because one of us has a 403b retirement plan through the employer and instead suggested doing a SEP IRA. I have been looking to verify that information online but cannot find a terribly straightforward answer and would appreciate hearing some of the community's thoughts. 

TLDR: Are we eligible to do a backdoor Roth when filing taxes as a married couple with a MAGI of $201K and one of us has a 403b account through an employer? Any pros / cons vs a SEP IRA instead other than the contribution limits?

frtecu,recursiveG,Ireland wedding planner wants to charge additional $3000 to move the wedding.,"My wife and I were married legally last year but chose to have the ceremony and reception in May this year. We were having it in Ireland (we live in the US) and paid a wedding planning company located in Ireland to set everything up for us. Our friends and family were very excited and so were we until coronavirus hit. 

Now there are travel bans in most of Europe and Ireland has issued a mandatory quarantine. We contacted the wedding planner asking to move the date and they have informed us that since technically we already moved the date we would have to pay $2000-$3000. Last year at the beginning of the whole process we moved it 1 week later and thought nothing of it. They are saying now that we used our 1 free date movement when we did that and have forfeited our deposit if we move the date again. 

First, I don't know how they expect to actually service the wedding and hold the reception with a mandatory quarantine in place. Second, I believe we can travel to Ireland but everything is closed and I'm not sure we can get back to the US. Also, if we travel we are at risk of catching coronavirus and so are all of our guests.

What's shocking to me is that the wedding planner is not taking a global pandemic seriously. I understand if they can't offer refunds (even though they should), but they should at least be offering free rescheduling.

My friend, (17F), doesn't have wifi at home and lives in poverty. When schools closed, she contacted the school saying that she needs a router or something since the library is closed and she can no longer do any schoolwork. They only contacted her back today, saying that since she had access to a phone she should just use her data (she doesn't have any, for the record), and if she doesn't get all of her missing work in by the end of the marking period (Friday) she will end up failing the marking period, and her grades already weren't very good so she would completely fail multiple classes and would have to retake the year. She's a senior, so this is particularly devestating. She's tried asking if she can go over to friend's houses that have wifi, but nobody's parents are willing to risk it right now (including my own, even though I explained the situation). She has also tried crashing near open wifi spots but she's been told to leave multiple times.  
My other friends and I (18F, 16M, I'm 17M) live in much better conditions, and have already been providing her and her family with as much help as we can give. They're willing to accept our charity in such a trying time, but our parents aren't willing to give us any money to help and none of us have any money to our own names. In normal times, we would try doing chores for neighbors or something, but with everyone so paranoid right now nobody has agreed to let us do anything.  
Thus, I turn to you: does anyone have any suggestions for ways that 3 teens could raise $100 without family help or the ""easiest ways to make money"" of asking neighbors for jobs? We will do basically anything legal to help her.

We have 2 auto loans and a rv loan. All have amazing rates so I’m not complaining about that at all. Her gross income is $72,960 un taxable income is $27,000. Monthly rent/mortgage is $240.00. 

I was told that most of the credit building from those three loans goes to me because it’s my credit that was probably what allowed us to get the loans in the first place. I don’t know how true that is. 

Today she applied for the Citi secured MasterCard and was declined. I didn’t know people could get declined for secured cards. The reason I recommended it was because I got a secured card at 18 with no credit history. 

She doesn’t have any late payments or a thing like that. I know that for sure because we checked her credit with the credit bureaus and I take care of our finances so I know she hasn’t missed any payments. 

We’re specifically looking for cards or ways to build credit for her. I’m not concerned about points or cash back or any of that good stuff.

If the markets go up more than 20% between now and when they turn it back on, then its a loss waiting, but that seems unlikely (and has diminishing returns as time goes on). Also, maybe this lasts more than just a quarter or two. Just seems like a extra 20% might be worth waiting for.

Please bare with me as I am new to reddit and this community. Below I will do my best to give an explanation of my current situation and future short/long term goals.

\- I am working full time in a secure job (90k salary) in Alberta

\-24 years old

\-I have 0 debt but I do not own any properties or have a mortgage

\-I will not be purchasing a home anytime soon as my job will require me to relocate every 2-3 years within Canada

\-90k inheritance from family, plus 20k saved up = 110k in a high interest savings account 

I recently spoke to a few people and they thought I was crazy for just leaving this money in a high interest savings account.

They suggested I max out my TFSA which I believe is around 49k given my age? Furthermore, they suggest I invest now given the discounted stock rates and pursue a balanced to more aggressive portfolio.

I reached out to a few advisers and it seems like they all take 2% + mers to help manage my portfolio. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for someone in my shoes with 0 experience in stock investing. I just opened up and got approved for my TFSA account last week, currently 0 funds in it as they are all in my high interest savings account.

I am with RBC and would like to use the RBC direct investment and hopefully be able to invest myself and avoid the 2% mers. Anyone have any suggestions for me??",5,1585581332,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frsm49/24_years_old_six_figure_inheritance_just_opened/,personalfinance,1

frslmj,DestWeddingAITA,"We need to refinance our home. Is it stupid to take out a 401k loan for the closing costs, or should we just save up the cash?","Monthly take home pay between partner and I is $10k. 

Home valued at $325k, we have $285,500 left, 6.00% interest rate, and we are a little less than 2 years into our 30-year mortgage. 

We would like to refinance to a 15-year conventional, at a 2.875% interest rate if we paid about $6k in points. This is based exclusively on me qualifying for the application. This would increase our monthly mortgage payment by about $50, then would be lower than our current when PMI drops off in a shorter amount of time - refinancing seems like a no-brainer. We're just trying to figure out the best way to approach it while rates are low to stop throwing away so much money. 

Our estimated cash to close is $13,500 including the points. Our emergency fund is far too low (sitting at around $5k due to a prior emergency, we have no other savings minus \~$3k in stock I absolutely can't touch) but we are working on rebuilding. I work for a major bank and given the current environment, we don't feel now is the time to blow cash. 

I have $39k sitting in my 401k. My company offers the usual loan where I pay myself back the principal and interest through automatic payroll deduction. We could set the $13500 aside in maybe 12 months time through aggressive saving, or we could pay the $13500 off in increments over a similar span of time through the loan.

frrzuv,penguinise,"KEEP CALM: The last day to claim the CARES Act tax credit (""stimulus check"") is October 15, 2024","The tide of information about the CARES Act is slowly starting to settle into accuracy, but there are still tons of people in a blind panic trying to do something ""in time"" to ""get their check"".  There are some great threads with all the details, but I think this headline deserves more attention.  Yes, you have **4½ years** before you can miss out on this payment.

**The ""stimulus check"" is a 2020 tax credit and eligibility is based on your 2020 tax return** (which will be filed in early 2021).  The government is going to try to provide many people an advance payment of this credit (see later), but critically everyone will have the opportunity to claim the credit on their 2020 taxes.  If you meet the eligibility criteria in 2020, and for *any* reason have not received payment yet, you can claim the credit on your 2020 taxes and it will increase your refund.  That is, if **in 2020** you:

* Cannot be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer, and
* Are a citizen or legal permanent resident, and have a Social Security Number, and
* Have a 2020 adjusted gross income less than
   * $99,000 (single)
   * $146,500 (head of household with one qualifying child - plus $10,000 per additional child)
   * $198,000 (married filing jointly - plus $10,000 per qualifying child)

then you are eligible for the CARES Act tax credit, and at the latest you will collect the credit by filing an accurate 2020 tax return and claiming the tax credit on it.  It does not matter whether you filed in 2018.  It does not matter whether you filed in 2019.  It does not matter if you were or were not a dependent in those years.  It does not matter how much you earned in those years.  It doesn't matter if you earned nothing in 2020.  You will get your money.

If you are owed a tax refund, you have three years from the original due date to late-file your tax return with no penalty and claim the refund.  Therefore, if you asked for an extension on the original due date, the last possible day you can claim your tax credit and receive the money is October 15, 2024.  (For most late filers, it will be April 15, 2024.)

Some time in the coming weeks, Treasury will be making **advance payments** of the tax credit to everyone eligible they can find.  It is worth stressing that this is guesswork by the government, and we don't know exactly how it will work.  You only need to worry about it in two circumstances:

* You may receive an advance payment despite not qualifying for the credit in 2020.  The government has specified you won't have to pay back the advance, so you can game the system by getting an advance payment and pocketing it.  
* You are currently in such dire financial straits that you cannot wait 10 months to collect your money.  This is obviously a rough spot to be in - also make sure you have signed up for other benefits you might qualify for, like food stamps, unemployment, stays on evictions (depends on your local government) etc.

Otherwise, keep calm and take a chill pill.  You will get your money eventually.  Asking solely about the advance payments is not helpful, because **we just don't know**.  Treasury is going to guess who to send the money to, and there is literally no recourse or corrective mechanism - the recourse is waiting to file your 2020 taxes.  Specifically, for an advance payment:

* We don't know if you must file a 2018 or 2019 tax return.
* We don't know what happens if there are conflicting returns about your dependency status.
* We don't know how fast the IRS will process something you send in now.
* We don't know on what date they will determine your eligibility for advance payment.

You are not asking about the rules or the law.  You are asking ""will Treasury get it right the first time?"".  And the answer is we just don't know.  You can fix it up next year, and you will still get your money.",2,1585579265,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frrzuv/keep_calm_the_last_day_to_claim_the_cares_act_tax/,personalfinance,1

They asked for EIN instead but I don’t have that as well. So I think I few options in here and I don’t know which one os better. 

Option1: The USCIS offering an EIN for foreign students because of the coronavirus. So I can get one and set up the payment with it. 

Option2: I register as a Saudi and connect the account to my saudi bank account and only pay taxes for the US sales. 

Option3: I register as a Saudi and connect it to my US bank account? Is it ok to have a business registered in Saudi and their money in US bank account?

* Combined they made 140k last year, he made 90 of that
* Mortgage is 1400/mo, owe $160K, worth $185-190K
* Car Loan - $450/mo (sisters), his car is paid off
* Combined they have $45K student loan debt - payments $700/mo
* $6,500 credit card debt (two cards)
* $8,000 in cash/savings they can touch today
* They have 1 kid in 1st grade

Right now my sister is stressed as the prospects of homeschooling my niece along with potentially carrying the financial load is daunting. While I am inclined to help if possible, I also needed to get the whole financial picture before jumping and saying yes.

I am not sure how the advisor is managing the fund now, vs then,  but it has stayed about the same dollar wise in the past 8 years.  Meanwhile it seems like we are paying him atleast $300 a year to manage everything.  It has always seemed to be harder to get a 1099 from him then it should be, too. So we have decided to manage everything ourselves.

There is about $40,000 in the account.  Almost everything is down right now,  but I would mostly roll it into a Vanguard Total Stock Market etf.

frr7zz,dunkindonutsDD,Is it ever worth it to live off of some student loans while pursuing a career change?,"Hello Reddit, 

So I'm a 23 F who graduated college Dec 2018. My degree is a BS in Healthcare Administration. I worked full time while going to school full time, and my loan balance was 10k (now 8k). I was really lucky to get a job with a well known hospital in a well known medical center. This job is not exactly my dream job. This current role is more of a customer service role. It pays 53k a year. Monthly I make $3200. I have paid off cc debt ($3.5k) and other miscellaneous debt ($1.5k), I have my emergency fund for about 3 months and am currently contributing to my pension and a Roth IRA. My monthly expenses are about $1.7k (rent, utilities, groceries). Within the next few months I have the option to move in with my SO, who lives about 40 miles from my job. (lease is up in June, current apartments are raising rent by $300) This would be a long commute every day (About 2 hours), but I would be able to save about $2k a month, whereas now I save about $800 a month. Bottom line, I feel hopeless that I picked a good career, there is NO growth in my department, and I have applied to numerous jobs internally with no luck. I just feel discouraged, and am questioning job security, especially during this time. 

I have considered going to nursing school (BSN), I have all the pre reqs and the necessary testing (Nursing was my major before switching). I can apply for next Spring or Summer, not sure if I would actually get in, but in the event I do, I would not be able to work full time. I would also try to have my existing loan paid off before taking on any more. 

 My main question is, is it ever worth it to maybe live off of some loans or not work during the time of pursuing another degree? I'm leaning towards having the commute in the meantime so I can save money of course, I just don't think it would be enough money to cover tuition completely and other living expenses by the time the Nursing program would start.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Is it ever worth it to live off of some Student loans when pursuing a career change??

The adjuster estimated the damages for over $14k but I have $2.5k deductible and my limit is $10k. So I got a $10k check which I mailed to my mortgage company.

I dont have money for that and since I temporarily lost my job due to that virus, I have a lot of time to do the work myself. 

Is there any way I can get them to send me a check?

What will happen if I buy the materials (around $6k) and do the work myself (free). Will they just send me $6k and keep the rest?

The salary is $55,000, and I’m happy with that, but some of the benefits I don’t understand as much. I would appreciate any help deciphering all the info. Additionally, any wisdom someone can give is also appreciated!

Health Insurance: 
The organization offers two types of plans, a low deductible ($250) and a higher deductible ($1,000) plan. In low deductible is $15 for specialist, office visits, and $25 for urgent care. The high deductible plan is just about double those amounts. The premium is $130/month on the low deductible, and $100/month for the high deductible. 

Firstly, are these considered good? Secondly, just because I’m young, and have few needs for medication and visits, I feel I should go with the high deductible, can I change a year or so later typically? 


Retirement:  
I’ve posted a link for this one as it’s hard for me to understand what’s best, but I don’t plan to be at the employer forever, so I feel the pension isn’t best, am I correct? What else can everyone tell me about the options here?

frqy99,OMG_stepbro_no,Guidelines for credit card charge disputes/rejections,"Good morning.  Last week, I dealt with a lowlife who hauled some garbage away for me for a price that was agreed to up front and in advance.  Paid with visa credit card over the phone, was OK with the charge that popped up 15 minutes later ($500).   3 days later, I saw a charge of $700 from the same merchant appear on my card.  When I called him irate, he barked out that the material was heavier than he expected and that I was lucky he wasn't charging me for more.  I said clearly to NOT charge the card, and he hung up on me.

This got me thinking.  I'm in business myself and use my card all the time, but I haven't had someone do this to me before.  I mean, this was really bold, essentially reaching into my pocket and trying to take cash out as if he was in control of the transaction the whole time.  How would you handle this?  I don't even view this as a ""dispute"" so much as a ""rejection"" of the charge.

I did some light searching, and was led to this website: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0219-disputing-credit-card-charges) .  The takeaway from this is that your credit card company is only required to follow the process if you send them a letter through the USPS.  So I'll start this process and state that the transaction was completely unauthorized and instruct them to reverse the charge.  

Now, I know, I know, I violated rules 1 and 2 of any transaction (get it in writing, get it in writing), but this was so simple and quick that I just didn't think to go through the effort - it was a curbside pickup that lasted 10 minutes.  We dealt with each other over the phone, and what is complicating the situation is that I do approve the price that we agreed to in advance ($500).  But I absolutely need to be in control of my money and can't have a wild actor just randomly entering transactions onto my credit card.  I also can't have a credit card company agree to pay charges that I don't approve.

Would I have a better experience with American Express?  I've heard that they put more control in the hands of the consumer.  

Is there a consolidated thread with all sorts of credit card dispute guidelines?  I'm sure that I'm not the first to deal with this.

frqbw4,fmla2020,Becoming parents again during a pandemic,"Hi all,

My wife and I are expecting our second child in May, and we are trying to figure out what our finances are going to look like. 

Here's the relevant information:

* Me (male):
   * Earn $5,400 (gross) twice a month
   * Work for a company with &gt;500 employees, so I am eligible for FMLA but not paid FMLA
   * Corporate policy allows two weeks of PTO for the birth of a child; additional time is job-protected but unpaid, via FMLA
   * Currently I am getting full pay because I am working full hours, just on a modified schedule (morning plus night) so I can watch our daughter in the afternoon
* Wife (female):
   * Earns $2,800 (gross) biweekly
   * Works for a company with &lt;50 employees, so she is eligible for government-paid reimbursement of 2/3 regular rate for emergency sick pay since she watching our daughter in the mornings; currently working about half time
   * Was expected to be out for 3.5 months after the birth of our next child
   * Will receive 60% of regular full-time pay for 5 weeks from short-term disability.

We're preparing for the possibility that lockdowns will continue through June; in this case, we will have no primary or backup childcare, meaning it's up to us. In the weeks immediately following birth, I'll be the primary caregiver for the other three members of my family, so I expect to lose income for at least two weeks.

Since my wife works for a company with fewer than 500 people, I believe she is covered by the emergency FML provisions, 2/3 her regular pay rate for 10 weeks or whenever our first child's day care reopens, whichever comes first. 

My questions are:

1. Is my understanding correct?
2. Would she be able to get pay under the expanded family medical leave provision even though she is getting compensation via short-term disability?

For the record, we have an emergency fund that could float us for six months with no income at all, we have a taxable investment that we can tap into if we're desperate (trying not to since it's way down, obviously), and we can get by on my income alone once I return to work. I'm just trying to make sure that we don't miss income opportunities just because we don't know they exist, especially if some of those opportunities expire if not utilized at the right time.",1,1585573134,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frqbw4/becoming_parents_again_during_a_pandemic/,personalfinance,1

I've read up a bit on taking out loans from my 401k, but there are some variables I'd like to learn more about. 

So from my understanding, you can set your own interest rate. Since the interest paid is taxed, why not just make the interest rate 0% and then replace any lost growth with pre-tax income?

Also, I am considering taking out a loan of around $10k against my 401k to take out a chunk of my student debt ($16k at 5.5% APR). I would rather miss out on some 401k growth if I can replace it tax free later on than continue to pay interest on debt.

frq3py,jgall1988,Advice on settling credit card debt - US - Massachusetts,"Long story short, when I was 18, my parent’s refrigerator broke and at the time, I worked at Sears and opened up a card and bought them one. I also charged a portion of a semester of college on it. Anyways a few years later i ended up defaulting. They eventually took me to court and I worked out a payment plan, and was making small payments for a while. At some point I missed a payment, and eventually stopped paying again.

This was about 5 years ago. I got a letter in the mail from them a few days ago saying that I owe about $2300 and that they’re willing to settle for 70%. This almost sounds tempting, but I don’t quite have the money.

Is it worth contacting them to see if they’ll go lower? I could maybe swing $1000-$1200 if I’m pushing it. Bills are really tight right now. 

Second question is it worth asking if they can delete it off my credit history if they accept this amount? Do I ask them to send me a letter? Would email suffice?

frpxe8,ImpulsiveGent,"New car was totaled, I was not at fault. Insurance took care of my loan, what should I do now as a replacement?","So roughly 18 months ago I bought a new 2019 Subaru Crosstrek for $26k, with a loan through my bank. At the time of the accident I had 22k miles on it and still owed 20. The other guy's insurance paid it of and I got an additional 3400 in my pocket.

Now I'm just left in that limbo phase where I'm not sure what I want to do. I'm not a fan of the idea that I'll be buying my second new car at 23 years old but on the flip side I would hate to buy anything different than exactly the car I had. I mean, it was 100% the other person's fault so why should I change my situation because of their mistake?

After crunching some simple numbers I found that this whole ordeal was a net loss of about $1,950 for me. So I could definitely afford to simply go to the same dealer, get the same car (with maybe a bit shaved off the sticker price, I'm sure i could swing that) and call it a day. But this situation put a bit of a sour taste in my mouth with new cars.

Sorry to ramble, I'll just ask the basic question I'm looking for feedback on.

We moved in in October when our lease was up to save money while I am studying, as I require a substantial amount of time off work for Nursing placements (4/12 months). I am due to graduate in March 2021. 

I have worked as a casual medical receptionist in my current workplace for two years. I therefore don’t get paid for my time off. My hours vary due to being a casual and my average fortnightly pay after tax over the last six months has been about a grand (with $557.21 being the lowest and $1,436.14 being the highest earnings).

My partner is a full-time second-year apprentice fitter and turner. He makes a steady $800 after tax per week.

My current fortnightly bills are $287.08.

Fuel: $50
Groceries: $100
Phone: $15
iCloud: $0.75
Spotify: $3
Vehicle Registration: $37.70
Dental Insurance: $23.63

• New (Second-hand) Car: 1K/5K (@ $200/fortnightly)

Shared: 

• Bills (used for shared expenses)
• House deposit: 4.4K/50K (@ $400 fortnightly) 
• Holiday: 1.8K/5K (@ $100 weekly)

Neither of us own a credit card. I have a ~3K student loan that I am paying off with my tax each pay and plan to use my tax return this year toward. I have set money aside in advance to cover my bills when I am on placements and off work.

Everything was on-line, DTI % perfectly fine, down payment set, etc.  Due to this 'pandemic', my spouse (who had the most stable job as a nurse), has had their hours reduced.  

Their job is very stable, still on file as being full time at X/hr.  Only 'issue' is the paychecks are reduced temporarily.  They work in an outpatient clinic, and love their job, so switching is not ideal, especially if only temporarily.  

Co-workers are applying for temporary partial unemployment, which I assume would be a terrible idea.  We are fine financially with the reduced hours, for a bit.....my main question is:

Will lenders confirm their employment, and it will come in as ""Yes, on staff for full-time at X/hr""....or will they obsess over the hours they are getting over this short time frame.

The thing that worries me right now is that it’s highly possible with everything going on right now that the new company doesn’t have enough work to do after this crisis due to the recession that’s coming and the amount of layoffs. Since I have a 2 month probation?(don’t know what the right word is, we call it a testing period) they could fire me in the first two months if there’s not enough jobs, leaving me with nothing. 

I’m really afraid to quit today due to all of this but at the same time it’s such a huge step up for me, I’m going from a callcenter to an actual office job which I’m not really qualified for officially so it’s huge for me.

frmvcd,reth1nk,Furlough or Big Pay Cut,"Hopefully some smarter people in here can give some advice on my current situation.

With the Covid-19 situation going on bunch of companies are hurting. Mine is no exception. I'm a software engineer in Seattle. Before the entire covid thing even happened my company made a pretty drastic lay-off about 15-20% of employees. We're all currently remote and we've just been asked if people would volunteer for full-time furlough temporarily or part time work or salary cuts. 20-30%. They're still not sure if the salary cuts are across the board.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously with the stimulus package, furlough gets unemployment from state and federal, keep my medical benefits. So far I haven't heard if we're signing contracts for how much of a salary cut and for how long that salary cut will be active for.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few side projects I would absolutely LOVE to work on for a month or two full-time and try to get launched since it could provide some passive income after all this pandemic shit subsides. I also am starting not to trust the company too much. Even after asking for furlough volunteers, when I said I was willing, my director and my CTO both messaged me trying to persuade me to either do part-time or the salary cut because I can easily stop doing my manager work and contribute to the platform as an individual contributor. I also do not like the idea of taking a salary cut with no definitive date when my current salary would be reinstated.

Last part of the equation. I just got underwritten for a house literally days before going fully remote and before any of this furlough talk started. I decided to hold off on a first home purchase for now and will probably pick it up again around october / november.

So what is the best scenario? Is furlough temporarily for 1-3 months bad if I start to look for a house again in october / november when I get underwritten again? Or will a huge salary cut 20-30% which would cut me by around 50K be just as bad? Worse? Better? Or part-time. I don't think part time is the right thing to do since I lose my health benefits.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this all makes some sense and someone could offer some life advice because this is obviously the first time I'm going through something like this and not sure how to navigate it best, especially for knowing my goals I have for the end of the year.

My mom is already doing numbers to reform the hotel into small, affordable apartment units.

My original major was Fine Arts and Design, which is something I truly enjoy but I was always very realistic on the work opportunities it offered, or the lack thereof. However, given the weird circumstances of the world, perhaps I could take some chances in the artistic/design fields rather than in tourism.

I have a part time job while Im in school which nets me about $400 after taxes, a week.

The current balance on those are;

Account 1: 2000$ (I never go below 2k on it)
Account 2: Has enough to cover rent for the next 12 months
Account 3: 1500 emergency fund

I posted recently about opening a HYSA which I did at Alliant but I would like clarification on another question. Alliant, for example, offers a traditional IRA account with a 1.60% APY. Right now I have a YouInvest by Chase IRA account which I opened because I have an existing checking account and for 2019 tax purposes. I’ve been told to keep contributing to the IRA monthly and trying to max out each year. I was also told to just leave the IRA alone otherwise (don’t invest in the stock market with it) and let it grow over time. However YouInvest has bare bones APY. 

Does it make sense to transfer the account to a place like Alliant for a better APY and continue to contribute and leave that account like so? 

YouInvest seems to be more for actually investing the IRA in the stock market.

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, if it's not ill take this down right away. Basically I took out a stupid high-interest loan.

Naturally, I want my car back, so I call Honda Finance(the institution the car was loaned from) and after speaking to a representative they are 100% adamant that they will not give me my car back unless i pay them 27k by April 2. Otherwise theyll take the car to auction, sell it, and Ill have to pay whatever is left. I do not have 27k. Because my car was towed no financial institution is willing to loan me money.

Would there ever be a situation where it could make sense to have one person take out a mortgage and have the other person not be on the mortgage, but contribute the full down payment? Is this even possible? If it *is* possible, what would you suggest in terms of splitting up the home ownership? Since one person would have obviously contributed the equity upfront but the other one is carrying all of the risk with the mortgage. 

I get it’s probably best to just not do any of this in the first place (assuming it’s even possible)....but just wanted to gauge all of our potential options. 

Thank you in advance! 

TL;DR- Can one person take out a mortgage while another person contributes the full down payment? If so, how would the ownership split work?",16,1585546021,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frkyjq/one_so_takes_out_a_mortgage_the_other_so_pays_the/,personalfinance,1

Another important piece of information is the fact that I don’t come from the richest family. They will only be able to pay for my first year of university.

Now we also switched from commissions being more monthly than quarterly as well as better healthcare and dental options.

Now I noticed that my salary (I am paid bi-monthly) was $300 higher as a result and at first I wondered if it was because of my commissions. 

In recent months due to the stress of a bad performance and my head potentially being on the chopping block, I did not dig into the nitty gritty. I thought if it is not something that went through, my company's HR or Finance department would hit me up over it. 

So I got into the nitty gritty and checked, my W4 was never submitted when we transitioned to a brand new system and just now I am realizing this. I am livid at myself for not getting to it but at the same time thought that there would be something in place for us to be reminded of doing this and if we didn't, then heck they would not pay us.

frk6x2,chaulklet,Buying out/Removing a Co-Borrower on house,"To give some context, bought a house last year and I wasn't making enough to fully signed on myself. I wasn't comfortable using the VA loan to purchase because that means I would mean I would have to almost dump my whole paycheck into paying the mortgage. So I ask one of my buddy to co-sign and we split the mortgage half half as they now own half the house. We went conventional loan and put 10% down on the property. 

We had it set up where on the 2nd year of home-ownership where we would decide how to move forward either by we both move out and rent out the place, I buy him out or if no agreement, put the house on the market. My original goal I had in mine was to keep increasing my monthly income and in 2 years, I would have enough income to purchase my own using the VA loan and have the other property as rental. I have zero debt, it's just I didn't make enough monthly to qualify for what I wanted at that time.  Now, i'm not progressing as quickly as I wanted to so I am thinking of just buying the other person out when the time hits. I still make more than I did at that time but the math wouldn't qualify me for much to where i'm comfortable in paying. 

What is the best course of action to buy this said person out? I was thinking of when that time comes to refinance which removes their name and also deal with paper side of the house and remove from deed and all other associated documents. By refinancing,  I would pull half the equity and just give them their half and call it a day but that would mean I am technically taking a second loan on the house which means I am losing money.

frk3hm,HyperionYourMom,Questions About Mortgages FHA vs. Conventional and Credit Scores,"Hello all,

 I started the process of buying a house recently (first time) and i want to make sure I make the right decisions. 

Everyone I have talked to (including my realtor) has said the best way to go for a mortgage is conventional and to avoid FHA if possible. They say that I'll have more options with a conventional as far as buying goes.

I thought this would be no problem I make around 105-150K a year and I have under 18K in student loan debt, and my credit recently jumped up to around 725. My credit jump came after making a massive payment (10K) on my student loans. I check my credit regularly with Credit Karma, and while I understand that a lender will use a different calculation when it comes to my mortgage, I thought that the CK scores would be a close enough estimate.

Well, my lender gets back to me about my credit check and says that my score came in at 660, which would mean I would need to take out an FHA loan and not a conventional loan like everyone has recommended. The issue is I applied for this loan maybe a week after CK was reporting my balance deceased on my student loans and my credit jump (which was from 660 to 725). I asked my lender about it and she was almost dismissive saying that a FHA loan won't be an issue, seeing as people are looking to sell ASAP in this market. 

I contacted my realtor and he is telling me that while the FHA loan isn't the end of the world, it does limit which properties I would be able to look at buying, and he recommended looking at townhouses instead (which is a solid no from me, dog). 

I decided to look up my actual credit reports from the three bureaus and noticed that only one of them has the balance reported as paid down from 28K to 18K (I can't remember off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure it was Equifax that was reporting the balance paid down).

&amp;#x200B;

So I am not sure where this leaves me. If waiting for my credit to go up is the smart thing to do I want to do it but I don't even know if waiting for that balance to report will raise my scores.

frjsnc,Beautiful_Sort,Asked if I want my name add to refinance mortgage.,"Hello there this is a throw away account.
 Some basic info a family member that is very old has a house in Florida with mortgage with $60,000 left on it. This family member is currently renting the house out just under double the mortgage rate. This family member is thinking they will not see the next 12 years. They want to make sure the house goes to someone. But also needs the money for house improvements, and pay off credit cards. They are going to refinance either way with or without me.  One of the main things they are going to to is put in solar power which should net a large tax break but the family member dowsnt do taxes since they live off SS. They are thinking about adding my name on for refinancing the property along with adding me as power of attorney , not the medical one. They are most likely only going to refinance for roughly $100k.  I won't pay anything or have to deal with anything until the family member becomes senile or dies. At that point its mine to do what I want. If i agree this will all be on paper and notarized. They also brought up the idea of me being a silent partner.

Info about me I dont live in Florida, steady income above average income and about to get married. Possibly getting our own house with in two years time.

If I  agree I dont plan on moving in I would most likely keep renting out allowing it be a source of income, once its paid off probably keep doing so.

I tried looking alot of my question up but keep getting results  on refinancing houses. So I hope someone can help. My main concern is if I agree how or ever of it would effect first time buyer benefits,  would if affect being able to apply for a house mortgage in the state I live in?",19,1585540589,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frjsnc/asked_if_i_want_my_name_add_to_refinance_mortgage/,personalfinance,1

frjn9s,Zebal1228,Complex Tax Situation. What is the best course for my family?,"**TL;DR**

Spouse has overwhelming debt due to being screwed over by ex-husband. I would like to file Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) to take the benefit of lowering our taxable income by 20k versus 7k or so with filing Married Filing Separately (MFS). Currently I am the only income for 2019/2020. I am also concerned on how MFS will affect the recent stimulus check.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Without trying to write a book on why my spouse owes $250k+ to Uncle Sam (her psychologist ex-husband sold his practice in Texas while she was a housewife, didn't pay his taxes right, and then his CPA/lawyer screwed up her innocent spouse and it got denied--assuredly did not have her best interests at heart). The married and lived Texas which is a community law state so debt and benefits are split. This guy died a couple years ago leaving her widowed, during which we have established residency in Alabama. So we did not have to bother with a divorce before marriage in Alabama. 

She was separated for about 3 years when I met her. She said the only reason she has not got a divorce at the time is she was worried she would lose benefits of the land against what she owes. He has land in Texas that the IRS and other creditors have a lean against, but we are working on saving to legal counsel for a tax and elder law. We have not been contacted about a will or given any information of the current state of the land. His family cared so little there was no funeral or even obituary. Body was claimed and cremated by the state. The IRS at minimum keeps contact via mail so the debt does not fall off after 7 years of no contact. Ideally if they took the land and left her alone she would be fine with that. Just leave everything of that past life behind that was with an alcoholic domestic abuser.

So she has since always has had her withholding taken each year that she worked for the past 10 years or so. I married for love, even though it seems like I keep finding out about new debts or I am just blocking it out of my mind. I have complete financial control right now until she gets back working. I am able to keep zero balance on my cards month to month along with paying mortgage/rent/utilities. She does not want me to file MFJ because she is worried the IRS will take away my refund for her debt. She would rather divorce me than ""infect"" me with her IRS debt.

Playing around with TurboTax this year if I filed jointly I would get $2,500 more, roughly, back on my return. I thought it would be awesome to apply that to a lawyer or worst case it is money the government can claim to go towards her tab they feel she ""justly"" owes.

My concern is even if I file form 8379 for injured spouse the only way I can make the claim is if (at least on TurboTax):

A) I filed (or will file) a joint return with my spouse (or former spouse)

B) All or part of our federal refund was (or will be) applied to my spouse's past-due federal tax bill.

C) I am not required to pay the past due amount.

The A&amp;C clauses I am fine with. B though scares me because it feels like I am giving them the authority to take everything if they so choose and not just the extra from filing jointly with her.

Our first year of marriage I filed MFS and got my return back super fast via eFile just as when I filed single. I spoke with two separate people from TurboTax through their web chat system. The first who appeared to be a lawyer suggested MFS after I described the situation to him, and the second who was a CPA suggested MFJ. The CPA made this suggestion because since I am in Alabama, which is not listed as a community property state, the IRS would not seize my refund as long as each year I fill out form 8379 when filing MFJ. Briefly Googling around I noticed another TurboTax rep said [similar](https://ttlc.intuit.com/community/taxes/discussion/it-was-important-to-answer-yes-to-question-6-and-you-answ/01/718069#M288674).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts? I am leaning towards MFS until we can consult an attorney to help us. I want to help her, even if the $2500 is a nickel to what she owes, but I just feel like a mouse smelling cheese and not noticing the trap if I check box that had clause ""B"" as mentioned earlier. We have always kept our finances fairly separate.

She said she does not plan to file since she does not have any income, but maybe she can still so that any benefit would go back to what the IRS says she owes? The stimulus info I have entices me to also file MFJ. On my W2 my wages/tips/compensation was listed as $72,912 in box 16 and I always claim our kids. So I may be able to get max stimulus if I still file as MFS.

I don't know. We want to make the best decision for the little family we are making together. On top of all this we are expecting our 3rd and last baby during the peak of COVID-19 this April.

Any helpful advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

frjhz0,Roylainey,Dominos took off with my money and won't refund.,"I am surprised how much Domino's Pizza has gone downhill lately.  Pizza Hut never treats us with disrespect, and I think Pizza hut is doing fine financially while Dominos is heading downhill financially.

The employee at the Hopkins Minnesota Dominos hung up in my face when I asked for manager.  She told me ""Manager said he won't give you replacement Pizza"", and I didn't even ask for a replacement Pizza.

I spent $30 and never received the Garlic sauce I paid for, and to make matters worse, the deep dish pizza was not even thoroughly cooked, I tasted some raw uncooked dough and was like ""What on earth?"".  

If I order the same deep dish pizza via Pizza Hut, I find that it is well done and has all the buttery taste and all.  So am shocked Dominos Pizza place near us wanted to charge me for a replacement Pizza even though I clearly told them they messed up and the Pizza isn't edible in its current state.

So I Just called my bank and they told me to call back to initiate dispute when transaction is no longer pending state.  I also gave the survey I got in email a 1 star and also explained everything.  

A Google search revealed that a lot of places are giving 1 star and other feedback like ""This Domino's is heading Downhill"" feedback in TripAdvisor and Google Reviews.  The store I dealt with has a 3 star in Google reviews, this place is used to people complaining about Pizza not made right so they all tell people ""We can't send you a free replacement Pizza"".  In the past they used to send a free replacement Pizza.

frj7ip,ethan475,Should I Even consider the offer my dealership sent me recently?,"My info upfront -- current 2014 Subaru Legacy owner. Purchased 3 years ago, $10k left to pay. Current loan is 4.5% on a 6 year term (so halfway paid off). 22 years old, 650ish credit, $36k yearly salary. Current payment is $300 with $180 for insurance, which I can safely afford. 

My dealership sent my a letter explaining that they need cars at the moment and they're willing to pay 115% book value. They appraised my car at $8200, roughly. Now obviously, on paper this already doesn't look good for me. $1800 in negative equity and I dont really want to roll the equity into a new loan. 

That said, I also saw they are offering 0% interest for 63 months on new 2020 Subaru purchases. So, it's a long shot, but I thought if I could swing a $0 down (would take 2 months to come up with this at least) and somehow get them to come up to 10k to pay my car off, it could maybe be worth it?

I don't need a new car. My car serves me well. Ive put 60k on her in 3 years and only a few minor issues. Love the car to death. But, if there's an offer on the table that I can make worth my while, I may as well look at it.

I had saved up about $250K over the previous 15 years working at school but mostly saving up in high-yield savings accounts (mistakes learned). My current annual living expenses are near negligible as I am single and live with parents. 

I currently hold both a traditional IRA (\~$10K) and a Roth IRA (\~$15K) because I am unsure of what my earnings will look like when I retire, so I've been hedging with both types of accounts over the past several years. 

I maxed out my employer 401K account in 2019, and plan to do so again in 2020. 

**Question: Should I be contributing to a Roth or traditional IRA moving forward, given the earnings below:**

2019 earnings: \~$100K ($90K salary + \~$10K private lending income)

2020 projected earnings: $130K ($120K salary + \~$10K bonus + \~$10K private lending income)

2021 projected earnings: $140K (80% chance) to $200K (20% chance, career move)

Projected earnings at retirement: It's really hard for me to estimate my salary 20-30 years into the future, but an out-of-my-ass guess would be around $200K. $100K or under also seems realistic to me (if I decide to take it easy having met my financial goals near retirement age), and so does $300-500K or higher (if I follow career trajectory into an executive position).

frisw3,vcycle,Is there any way I can preemptively block a scam transaction on my card?,"Hi,  


In a moment of distraction I signed up for a free trial at Shaw Academy and gave them my credit card number. The ad was in a safe context and it seemed like a basic cancel-before-they-charge situation so I foolishly trusted them.

When I had a moment I did some more research and realized that they are scamming people. They offer a real (low quality) product to claim legitimacy, but they do not let people cancel. Even after canceling, people are being charged for months after.

I immediately tried to cancel the trial online, but was told I had to wait 48 hours while they ""set up"" my account. After that, I tried to cancel and had to click through a bunch of ""please, don't go"" offers, until finally being told I had to call a phone number during their working hours. No one answered the call. I'm also unable to change my payment info through their website.

I'm not expecting to be able to cancel through them. Even if I do, based on all the negative reviews online I think they will charge me anyway. How should I proceed here? Is it possible to tell my bank in advance that this fraudulent charge will occur in a few weeks? Or must I wait for them to charge me before contacting my bank? If I block that charge, would subsequent charges also be blocked or would I need to perpetually fight them?

I'm so disappointed in myself for falling into this trap, but I hope there's a solution other than changing my card number.

I read here that some people recommend to save some money and by 50 you will be a millionaire. But in my case I live in Belgium and here u can't just save money and get much more in return about 20-30 years. Our highest intrest rate is 0.65% so that's not an option.

I was thinking of start to invest some decent amount of money, but idk where to start. Nowadays i'm just fucking a bit around with trading apps like trading 212 and forex (test accounts) trying to understand the market
Maybe somebody got any tips or advice how to start building financial independance? Anything would be much appreciated.",2,1585536199,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/friruw/17yo_about_to_get_18yo_future_saving_plans/,personalfinance,1

I would move my car periodically but haven't done so in about 1.5 months due to life things and just not checking.

The car is a **2008 Ford Taurus** in good condition with about \~170k miles on it. I haven't driven it at all recently due to living in a commuter city and the whole situation with Corona. Despite not driving a lot, the car has sentimental value since it was my grandpa's gift to me before passing. I'm having trouble deciding whether to keep it due to it's sentimental value or to get rid of it since I only have $2,600 in the bank.

frin6k,dayzandy,"Advice on ""Fishing"" for an Apartment Deal?","Hi everyone,

I saw recently on another post someone claiming they knocked off hundreds of dollars from the listed monthly rental price, and wasn't sure the best way to go about asking for a rate lower than the typical listing?

I'm not just talking about negotiating with craigslist postings by owner, but also large apartment complexes and property management groups.

I definitely want to be respectful, but I expect in my area (Northern MA/Southern NH) where property values have skyrocketed in recent years, that there will be a fairly noticeable decline right now even though listings may not reflect that at the moment.  I'm hoping I can negotiate listings in the $1300-$1500 range into my budget of $900-$1100.

I'm lucky enough to have money saved up that I can offer paying 3 or 6 months rent advance if that may help get them to sign off, but wasn't sure if there are any other tips you may have for finding a deal during these times?

frik3y,vgacolor,If you or your family owns a small business - The new law can help.,"There are a couple of programs that were included in the legislation signed into law on Friday that can help you or your family's business. Or if you work for an unsophisticated owner of a Small Business, you should bring it to their attention so that they can get the help and that helps trickles down to you so that you retain your job.

**For immediate assistance.**  

.

Emergency grants: The bill provides $10 billion for grants of up to $10,000 to provide emergency funds for small businesses to cover immediate operating costs. This can be applied online and can be found here https://www.sba.gov/page/coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-guidance-loan-resources

I went through the first two screens and it seems fairly painless. I could not go further because I do not own a business, but you should gather the basics about your business to fill it out.  **This is live Now!**  

.  


**For significant long-term help**

Forgivable loans: There is $350 billion allocated for the Small Business Administration to provide loans of up to $10 million per business. Any portion of that loan used to maintain payroll, keep workers on the books or pay for rent, mortgage and existing debt could be forgiven, provided workers stay employed through the end of June.  

This is a working capital loan and is going to be done through the banks. So for this you will need to work with your bank even if you do not have a loan with them. If your bank can not help then contact other banks. I don't think the procedures and guidelines are set, but one thing I really like because it will help pay payroll, some benefits, rent, mortgage payments, rent, and interest expense on existing loans from February 15 to June 30. I work for a non-SBA lender but I encouraged my boss to bring it up with upper management as it seems we can be approved to participate for this program alone.",1,1585535334,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frik3y/if_you_or_your_family_owns_a_small_business_the/,personalfinance,1

We live in Pennsylvania.  That is his permanent residence.
He completed a Co-op in Ohio.  As far as I have read and understand: 
he does not need to file in Ohio because OH and PA have reciprocal agreements and the company did submit his PA payments. 

While at school he holds an off-campus job.  His total income for the year was 17969.  His income from the job in NY was 7589. He paid $119 to NY state on that W2.  I am using Turbo Tax online to file his federal and state taxes.  PA and NY do not have reciprocal tax agreements.  As far as I know, he must first file in NY in order to get that credit for Pennsylvania.  I also believe that he is required to file in NY because he made money there.

When I fill out the PA state form on Turbo Tax, it states that he owes $233 in additional income tax.  He paid $119 to NY state. I would like to be able to credit his NY state payment.

When I fill out his NY state tax return, it counts all of his income (including income from Ohio) and taxes the NY state portion at a higher rate due to the higher total income (I think?).  He is a non-resident because his residence there is temporary for the purpose of attending school.  According to the calculator, he owes an additional $156 in NY State taxes.

I am unsure of what to do, and in what order to do it.  I read somewhere to file the non-resident state first and then request the credit on the Pennsylvania tax form.  Am I doing this right? Alternatively, is there a different sub I should be posting this question in?  Thanks in advance for all of your help.

Purchasing my first house and I have some questions about the appraisal process. We made an offer today (which was accepted by the seller) which included about 3% of the purchase price of the home as closing costs to be paid by the seller ($315k + 9.7k CCs = \~ 325k), the original asking price was 319k but this is where we ended up after negotiation since I wanted to put down 10% and that left me cash-poor for closing costs. (gotta keep that emergency fund)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is -- can anyone speak to the chances of the house being appraised at a value lower than what we agreed on? Also, what happens if this happens?

Also bonus question -- has anyone chosen a credit union (or FCU) as a mortgage lender? Were the closing costs high? I got a really good rate from my FCU (3.25% on a 30 year conventional fixed) with no PMI but I forgot to ask about closing costs. I'm still shopping around and will ask about CCs with the FCU loan tomorrow, but is there anything else I should look out for?

\---------------------------------------------------

Maximum Deferral

* 90% of annual compensation
* IRS limit: $18,000 per year, $24,000 if 50 years old or older (IRS limits change periodically)

Company Match Formula

* Company will match 50% of the first 6% of eligible plan compensation (see definition below)
* Annual company match limit: $2,000.00
* 2 year vesting period (“cliff vesting”). Employee retains 100% of company matching contributions after 2 years of service. If less than 2 years of service all company contributions are forfeited and will be used to reduce future company contributions to employees.

\---------------------------------------------------

Q**uestion 1)** Neglect taxes, suppose I am 25 years old and earn a $100,000 a year salary. How much will the company match me?

My guess 1.1) They will match 6% of 50% of $2,000.00 = .06\*.5\*$2,000.00=$60 a year 

My guess 1.2) They will match 50% of (6% of $18,000) = 50% of ($1,080)=$540 a year as this amount is under $2,000.

My guess 1.3) They will match 50% of (6% of $18,000) = 50% of ($1,080 as long as this amount $2,000)=$540 a year 

**Question 2)** What happens if I quit before and after 2 years of service?

My guess 2.1) If I quit 2 years before all of the money the employer matched will not remain in my 401K and if I quit after 2 years it will remain in my 401K",4,1585532295,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frhsss/401k_terms_help/,personalfinance,1

frhds1,kizbicky,Is now a good time to buy a new car? Seeking advice,"Due to the COVID-19 crisis in the US, I’m in the market to get a new truck. I think due to the economy in a volatile state I might pull the trigger and get a new vehicle.  

I currently drive an 2006 Toyota Tacoma with about 200k miles. The KBB values it around $6000. I got in a discussion with my dad and brother today, and they were arguing that I should buy a new truck. I have always been a fan of buying slightly used cars (2-3 years old with approximately 30k miles) so I don’t eat a lot of the initial depreciation. But they argue that with 0% financing of new vehicles, I might as well buy a new vehicle rather than spending a little less for a older, and possibly less reliable truck. My dad was also saying that it’s likely that no one is going into a car dealership with the economy being the way it is right now, and that I may get a good deal out the door.

I currently make $60k/year (closer to 70 with OT). I plan on putting 12k down with trade in. Ideally I would like to pay a max of $35k out the door. I know this may be a little unrealistic to buy a new truck. And this is also why I lean towards getting a slightly used truck. I also believe that 5-8k savings of buying a used vehicle ( versus new) can be reinvested into investment accounts that I’ve recently opened over the life of the auto loan. 

So reddit, I am seeking on advice, or personal experiences, on buying a new or used truck.",16,1585530655,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frhds1/is_now_a_good_time_to_buy_a_new_car_seeking_advice/,personalfinance,0

I have already made moving arrangements and signed final closing documents, but now the thought of paying double taxes is giving me anxiety. I’m concerned about how this will affect my pension and deferred compensation in the long run. I was about to open index funds with vanguard but now I’m thinking I should maybe keep that money a little more liquid and hold off until I see how my taxes are going to be affected next year. 

How will this affect my taxes? I already claim 0, but should I adjust my state and federal withholdings? And if I adjust withholdings with my CA employer, is there a way to make sure a portion of those withholdings are applied to NV? Or will I just have to pay lump sum come April without the benefit of having NV tax withholdings?

The result is me looking like I make far less money than I actually do. I have very few expenses, so I can easily pay my car expenses and a monthly loan repayment. I'm really good at saving money (it helps having no social life whatsoever). I also have a credit score in the high 700s, which I would hope would work in my favor and is what I'm hoping is what is my biggest selling point. I have 10 years of credit history and have never missed a single payment. My worry is that my income may not be viewed as ""reliable enough."" 

Realistically, if I waited a few months, I could probabl save up and buy a replacement car in cash.

Long time lurker, but a big fan of the advice given out here. I’m in a bit of a tough spot, so I’m hoping to get some advice. 

I had a debt go to collections through Agency 1 (opened a CC when I was young and couldn’t manage it properly). I was served papers through another debt collection agency (Agency 2) acting on behalf of Agency 1. When I contacted Agency 1, they confirmed it was legit and that they could not speak to me about my account and that I would need to speak to Agency 2 for all further questions. Not wanting to go the court route, I called Agency 2 and settled for an amount $100 less than the debt owed. 
Fast forward a few weeks, the court hearing is dismissed and I get receipts saying that it is settled, etc. I go to check my credit report and that collection is still there under Agency 1 and open, except the balance has gone down to just $100 (the difference in what was owed and what I settled). 
Since I settled and they verbally agreed that I have no outstanding balance, I contact Agency 2 and ask them why this is. They simply tell me that everything is right on there end and it shows that I have no outstanding balance and the account is paid in full. And that I should contact Agency 1 since they are the ones actually reporting to the credit bureaus. 
I call Agency 1 and they firmly tell me that they cannot speak to me about my account and that I need to call agency 2. I ask to be escalated to a supervisor and he tells me the same. 
I call Agency 2 and they tell me that Agency 1 should be talking to me since the account is settled and the balance is zero and that there is nothing they can do any further. 

Is there anything I can do or should be saying here? I feel like I’m stuck now that I’m trying to be financially responsible and improve my credit. 

Should I start a dispute with the bureaus? Lawyer up? Any advice is appreciated!


TL;DR

Agency 2 serves me papers for old debt through Agency 1. I settle with Agency 2. Agency 1 reports wrong info on credit report. Agency 2 says I need to take it up with Agency 1.

My husband and I are looking to buy a house in the next 3 years. I have a savings plan in place, but ideally would like to save as much as possible so we can afford the full 20% down (right now our trajectory will have us at 15% down).

Right now, I contribute 11% to my 401k. I was considering dropping my contributions down to the minimum to get the employee match (8%) and using the extra cash to invest separately in the S&amp;P 500. If the market improves in 3 years' time, I'll use that money as extra towards our down payment. If the market hasn't improved, I'll keep it invested and use it as supplemental retirement funds.

Say you buy what is today 25,000 USD worth of gold in bars or coins or whatever. You bury that shit in your backyard and meanwhile some crazy inflation happens. In theory the value of gold should rise with inflation or possibly surpass it. Now say you want to cash out this money for much more of the inflated currency and dig it out of your backyard. Now what the fuck do you do with it? You can't just go peddle gold bars to Joe Schmoe in the mall. If you go to some ""we buy gold"" place you'll get schlonged with fees and they won't buy at value because they want to resell it too. You're basically stuck with a bunch of heavy metal. 

and in case of the doomsday scenario where shit happen sot get so bad that the place turns into Venezuela or Zimbabwe, I can't see how having all that gold will do anything for you. Surely food, land, water, etc will be more useful and valuable than heavy metal.

First time posting here and need some help. I have gotten a letter from the IRS saying they need me to complete form 8962 and send in a copy of a 1095A. 

First issue is that I was on my dads health insurance for half the year and the 1095A is in his name. For the other half of the year I was on my employers health insurance. 

I don’t want to claim any of the premium tax credit as my dad will claim 100% of it. 

I have also filed as an independent and my dad will not claim me as a dependent on his taxes. 

I am having trouble filling out line 5 as I would like to put 401% but according to the table I make less than the federal poverty line amount. 

Should I go ahead and calculate the correct percentage even if I do not want to claim any of the premium tax credit? 

Also for PART IV: 

For allocation 1 I would like to allocate it all to my dad. So would allocation end month be the entire year we had the policy or only the time I was on the policy? 

         Section g: advance payment of the PTC            percentage should that be 0? 

My plan is to complete this and send my dads 1095A, my 1095B and this completed.

Back in November I purchased a (new to me) car, and in doing so shopped around for some financing options. I used Lending Tree to apply for multiple loans at the same time, and received a handful of offers.

When checking my hard inquiries on CreditKarma, I have multiple all on the same date from this car loan shopping, but with different descriptions: bank, finance, credit union, and automotive. I was under the impression applying for multiple auto loans at the same time would only qualify as one hard inquiry, instead of the 4 currently shown.

Should I call Equifax/Transunion to ask about this and/or file a dispute? Is this on me because I used Lending Tree? Or am I mistaken about anything here?

frepcd,Finance_QuestionsTA,Avoiding Foul Play in an Investing Club,"My friend and I want to create an investing club. We already created our LLC, and we're both listed as managers of the LLC. We plan to proceed with 50/50 ownership. I trust him 100%, and he trusts me 100%, but in order to give ourselves and all of our members complete peace of mind that their money is safe, what can we do to ensure there is no foul play? 

I've read a bit about the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, and it seems like it exists to hold scammers accountable in the types of situations that I fear. But we never want to get to that point. We want to completely prevent any financial scams, and know with 100% certainty that our money as well as our club members' money is always safe and withdrawable in the amounts that correspond with the contributions. For example: say I contribute $10,000 into the fund, I want the ONLY risk to my money to be the volatility of our underlying investments, and for it to NEVER be at risk from the people involved. In that example, with 50/50 ownership of the LLC, would my friend have the same access I do to that $10,000? 

If we are listed as the only 2 managers, how can we legally keep track of each member's % ownership of the fund? Another example: my friend's dad is very interested in contributing a large sum to the investment club account, but he is thinking about a worst case scenario where he passes away and his son does not have full ownership of that money. I'm sure my parents and other members would have similar concerns about varying scenarios.

Do I just find the highest-yield savings account I can? Do I invest it in relatively low-risk funds and plan to pull it out when I'm ready to start looking to buy? Do I hoard pennies in a jar under my bed? 

I'm also reading a lot about investing--I would like to start dabbling with that in the next 3-5 years as well--but my perception is that investment money and home savings money should probably be separate ventures, so I don't accidentally put too much at risk at once and endanger myself. Is this correct? 

Thank you for your help!! This /r was invaluable to me when I was first learning how to manage money  and I'm thrilled to be looking at next steps with your guidance as well. &lt;3",24,1585519530,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frebpr/whats_the_best_way_to_save_for_a_house/,personalfinance,6
freaxi,Qmill,Should I purchase a car or buy the dip?,"As of writing this on March 29th, the S&amp;P 500 is down about 16% over the past month. I'm a graduating finance student and have always been a fan of buying the dip. I know this is different and COVID-19 makes forecasting tough, but I'm currently in a tough position. I have an old 2002 Honda Accord that is likely on its last year or two (needs new tires, has body damage, various issues). I have about $15,000 cash and no student loans. I was planning to purchase a nice used car (think a used SUV from around 2015). Should I use my savings to purchase a car, or invest it in the market and buy a car later? 

I figure I have three basic options:

1. Sell the Accord and use the rest of the money and purchase a nice used car.
2. Sell the Accord and purchase an old used car that will get me through the next few years (spend $5,000 and invest $10,000). Then wait until my investments make a decent return to cash out and buy a nicer used car.
3. Continue driving the Accord, potentially wasting money on repairs, and invest the rest of the money.

fre519,Inside_Weekend,will I ever be able to get a job again after 2.5 years of searching?,"I lost my job 2.5 years ago and have been unsuccessfully job searching since then. I was applying to several jobs a week and doing phone screenings/interviews sporadically for the first two years. But now I’m applying to significantly less jobs (a few a month) because just there’s not much left to apply to. (It’s all the exact jobs I’ve applied to before being reposted, or jobs similar to the kinds I’ve already been rejected for many times.) I’ve been contacted about phone screenings and interviews a few times recently, but didn’t see the e-mails until too late because I only check once a week now (I get a lot of anxiety and dread when looking at my e-mail account because of all the rejections and ghosting). I’m not sure how I would even get the motivation to prepare for a phone screen or interview at this point since I already know that preparing doesn’t lead to getting a job. I'm just so tired of doing all this work and never making any progress.

I’ve tried applying to minimum wage jobs and have never heard back. I’ve applied to temp jobs, and the recruiters always just want to take my information and then I never hear from them again. People keep telling me to get another degree, but I already have two (and have to try to hide one to seem less overqualified), and I can’t afford it because I need to save what little money I have left for necessities and bills anyway.

I realised that I'm not happy what's so ever teaching this content area and I want more avenues than just teaching k-12. I pay tuition and pull out loans every semester , about 5,000 dollars. I just reached 100k in loans and I'm mortified . Although I had a full scholarship in undergraduate,  I left school three times because of medical leave. I also didn't have significant help from my parents to support me,  so I worked and used loan money to pay for my apartment and overall well being. I wasn't educated on pulling out loans at 18. Currently I work full time teaching and this has killed my ability to function academically . I ended up dropping 2 of the 3 classes I took on. 

I studied languages in undergrad and still would like to continue on with my studies. The new graduate program I got admission to is offering a tuition waiver and $700 a month as a stipend. I know I won't be able to live off of this so I'm not sure of what to do. I would be willing to work in addition to the tutoring assistantship but again I'm not sure if this would be enough. I would also like to somehow knockout my loans.

fre1jx,tokenathiest,Using balance transfer checks to pay off a vehicle loan,"Hi, PersonalFinance community. Have a question for everyone regarding loan APR vs balance transfer fees. I have a vehicle loan which comes fully due in a year (term: 48 months/remainder due at end of the term). The remaining balance is about $8,000 and the interest rate is 4%. My bank sent me some balance transfer checks linked to one of my credit cards with a promo 0% APR for 12 months. The fee, however, for using them is 4% which comes out to $320. The APR on the loan is about the same so my thought is I wouldn't necessarily be saving anything by transferring the balance and could negatively affect my credit by pushing one of my two credit cards close to its credit limit.

frdt7z,FatNorm,Federal Tax Refund Offset question?,"My situation is complicated but likely not unique.

The skinny:

Divorced 10 years ago; Signed off on a mutual child support worksheet agreement. I had not worked 2 years prior to signing this and due to threats by spouse, I signed my parenting rights away to give her 100% custody with zero child support. Prior to this, I fought my spouse in court while I was working and was going to likely win what I was asking for with regards to custody. Then the threats came and I backed down.

After signing the agreement giving up all rights, visitation and child support payments, my ex spouse modified the documents and submitted an altered agreement that had provisions that I must be all costs and fees for medical and education up until our child was 27!

I attempted to dispute several times with the Department of Child Support and the Support Enforcement Agency (SEA &amp; DCS), but they were always of zero help and always demanded I pay, even when I submitted documents and a notarized declaration of what had occurred. My request went ignored. I also tried to modify the payment agreements because I have been unable to work, I can’t get a drivers license or passport, so for more than a decade now I’ve had absolutely zero income. This, along with unrelated issues with my siblings left me without a home, possessions, cash, I’ve been homeless for many a year living in a shelter.

Now. At a time of great need, this stimulus AID package would really benefit me. However, due to being in arrears, the tax man will likely collect any relief that is coming my way.

Do I have any options to put a stop to this? The last time I dealt with the state DCS, I gave them my address to the shelter I was staying at, and a week later two police officers showed up. I don’t know what they wanted, but they did notify an employee at the shelter I stay at that it was related to child support.

I welcome any suggestions. While I don’t like being in this situation, it was never ever what wanted to happen. But I don’t know what to do. It was an all or nothing with regards to the ex spouse, and after a guardian ad litem report was not favorable, out came massive threats to destroy me, my career, and my life. I backed down due to duress.

Income-
Monthly take home pay: $3,760

Savings-
$18k in an online savings account @1.5% interest
$43k in a Vangaurd personal investment account (mostly invested mutual funds/ETFs)

Expenses-
No credit card debt, no student loan
Medical/dental/vision payment: $140 per month
Utilities: $150 per month 
Phone bill: $50 per month
Groceries: $380 per month
Rent:  I've been fortunate to not pay rent up until now but will contribute about $1k per month for rent.
Thinking of financing a used car during the summer.


Can you please help me find ways to maximize my current position? Specifically, my retirement savings are bleak.

I am new to learning about 401k.

Pre Tax 401k deferral: if you elect to make pre tax 401k deferrals than your taxable income is reduced by the deferral contributions so you pay less in federal income taxes. Later, when the plan distributes the deferrals and earnings you will pay the taxes on those deferrals and earnings.

Roth 401k deferrals: if you elect to make 492(k) deferrals, the deferrals are subject to federal income taxes in the year of federal. However the deferrals and in most cases the earnings on the deferrals are not subject to federal income texts when distributed to you. In order for the earnings to be tax free, you must meet certain conditions.

frdhgd,YourConsigliere,Spouse and I want to buy a house and old Veteran’s Admin mistake is holding down my credit score. Credit advice!,"Please advise- spouse and I want to buy a house and old Veteran’s Admin mistake is holding down my credit score.

I used some Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend a university. Stopped attending after three semesters. Got a bill from VA a year later after an address move to new apartment. They are asking for ~$3000 and this includes ~$1000 penalty. I thought that I had been underpaid for an amount two months earlier and now I get a big bill plus a $1000 punishment? I called them to ask them to make sure I was not underpaid previously and dispute this ludicrous sum they are asking me for (VA is screwed up and it probably doesn’t surprise you to hear they had screwed up payments in the past and basically screw up a lot).  

My call gets me to a very poor VA customer service rep who basically just restates he sees that VA is asking me for money. No help with my months old issue from him. No help on their demand. No explanation. I ask them to re-examine the account and fix this. Please get back to me with a fix. 

They get back to me with the same letter demanding money. I had called and waited in line on the phone to speak to someone. I took significant time to communicate to them - put forward my position. They promised to look into the matter. The letter is just a restatement to give them money. No facts. Just demands. 

I wrote them two emails at the web address on their site - dmc.ops@va.gov. They did not reply. It looks like they never replied ever. 

I waited and hoped they’d finally find their error and fix it then notify me. This seemed quite possible. They screw up a lot and then fix things later. 

My credit score was still pretty good and I could wait. 

Now honey and I want to buy a house X years later. It never got fixed. I should have called and called and got clarification. Issue just never got fixed. I finally get a decent communicator on the phone at VA now. It turns out Webster Univ semi-fraudulently said I was continuing education there and I did get one extra month of VA payment towards housing as full time student. Webster signed me up early to get their portion of the money early. That never crossed my mind that this could have happened. I did not do one hour of class the next semester. Dropped the school entirely. Payments often came in late.

So I pay the entire amount just to clear my credit score. Now VA placed a “Failed to Pay” on my credit. I did pay in full ... even paid the penalty. And this is what they give me? I was also away in military contingency when first two letters from VA came in on this way back when. I have supplied the VA documents on this as well. Wife and I disputed my Failed to Pay status to VA in 20 calls since then. This is since Oct I’ve tried to fix this. They have no brains and just rubber stamp that they feel they followed procedure and will not change. 

They do not use email. They only send letters so they can put people off and force them to give up hope. Terrible system. Affects my sense of goodness in the world. Now we are getting our congressperson involved but we hear they just exchange mail with the VA as well. It is just an aide helping us. VA has no accountability to good work. Their purpose is to help us (over 15 years service for me).

As far as I can see VTI is more diversified and has a higher dividend ratio than VOO, and VOO is more expensive. **Is the main difference that VTI holds less % of the top 500 companies than VOO does, or does VTI hold the exact same % of the top 500 companies as VOO and in addition holds more small and mid cap?** Because if the latter is the case then I think hands down VTI is definitely the better option but if not then it comes down to do you trust the 500 companies to a greater degree than a more diversified portfolio.  *I also hear* ***SPY*** *being thrown around a lot vs VOO!*

**Please let me know which is the case and is there anyone here who prefers VFIAX or VTSAX to VOO/VTI.** I want to put around 5K in the index or mutual fund this year and build on it monthly starting next year (thinking of averaging 5k every year for the next 10 years then increasing to 10K). **Also, I keep hearing to go through Robinhood or Roth IRA- Would either of these be a good option at the stage I'm in as I am in no urgent need of money and would love to sell when I'm 55 or so.**

If you have any other suggestions for specific stock or advice in general I would love to hear from you. I want to be smart about my money and get all the info I can

frd52p,Help_An_Irishman,"Very new to investing. Might've bought myself into trouble with Vanguard ETFs, and need advice before the market opens tomorrow.","Thank you SO much for reading!

Let me get this out of the way: I know I'm stupid and screwed up here.

I've been wanting to get into investing for years but didn't know where to start, and after talking with a pretty savvy (and wealthier) friend of mine recently, I got the ball rolling and put a good chunk of cash into a money market account with Vanguard, ready to trade.

My friend provided a spreadsheet of his allocations so I wasn't going to be investing blindly, but rather following his template. COVID hit the market hard, and I was happy to have dodged a bullet by not investing sooner.

Then when the rally started last week, I jumped in and invested \~$3k in ETFs in the US market (broad Vanguard and S&amp;P 500 stuff) and saw gains the following day, then put in the other \~$9k I had in my money market account. Next day I was up \~$500, and contacted by friend and he said to invest more cash if I had it on hand. I did so, and I was in for \~$20k altogether.

Now, I know I got ahead of myself here, as this is a lot of money for me. It's about 1/3 of my liquid assets, which is insane now that I type it out. The market dipped again on Friday and now I'm down \~$150 total AFAIK (not a big deal). His advice is to just ride it out, but we're coming at things from a bit of a different place: he can afford to let his investments sit for 5-10 years, but I'm in a position where I may not be able to do so, so this is high risk for me.

Obviously I know you can never predict the market day-to-day, but from what I'm reading I'm assuming that we're still in for a bit of a decline until there's *some* good news on the COVID front, meanwhile everything is getting worse especially in NY, the US, etc.

So what I'm considering doing is putting in a market order to sell off at least 2/3 of what I'd bought, so that hopefully the sale triggers early tomorrow morning and I don't lose much more than the $150 (a valuable lesson cheaply bought), then plan to invest again in the coming weeks or months. I don't anticipate striking at an ideal time as I obviously don't know what I'm doing, but generally I would like to get into the market during this crisis as I think eventually I'll come out stronger, but I went in **too fast with too much.** I'm not trying to be a day trader, moving things around all the time, but for now just want to pull back a substantial amount of what I've already put in, then let it lie.

So I'm looking for any advice that you may have. Also, a question:

\- If I put in an Market sale order today, Sunday, is it likely to execute first thing tomorrow when the market opens, allowing for me to ""freeze"" my losses at about where they are now, or might I have to ride out a day of potentially substantial loss before the sale is executed? This would be my first stock sale, so any info here is much appreciated.

frd11o,DasButterbrot,Refinancing mortgage while in process of buying second home,"I currently have a mortgage on our first property where my husband and I live right now (title in my name) and we are buying a new construction from a builder. Estimated completion date is end of June and we already signed the contract with the builder. Once we move, I intend to rent out my first property.

Since the interest rates are low, I was thinking of refinancing the first mortgage (3.8%APR). However, my bank told me that my current home will be considered as investment property, since my husband and I have signed the contract for the second home, so the new rate will be higher or about the same compared to what I have so it's not worth doing. The bank knows about our intention to buy a second home because we got pre-qual letter from them for the second loan (for the new construction).

Is this normal? Technically, our first home is still our primary residence at this moment and we don't have another mortgage. Can the bank deny me refinancing the first property as primary residence? Is there any way to still refinance before at good rate before we close on the second home?

frcriv,WombCannon,Collections of debt after statute of limitations?,"Slight back story:

I was bad with credit cards when I was young and racked up over 7k in debt and then 2008 happened.  I defaulted on the old credit card (im bad i know).  I have to mention I was living in Wisconsin at the time.  It was turned over to collections (Portfolio Recovery).  Long story short, they were unable to find me and after 7 years, it was taken off my credit report.  

Since then, I have moved to IL.  Well somehow, someone found me (maybe because I got a speeding ticket while visiting friends back in WI) and I was sent a letter from a law firm (Rausch Sturm) trying to offer me a deal on behalf of Portfolio Recovery to pay 2407 and I have until 3/30 to respond.  

I started googling around and this seems to be standard practice for them but one thing is bugging me and that is the fact that this is WELL beyond the statute of limitations to collect such a debt.  From what I read, the limit is 5 years in WI and 10 years in IL so from what I understand they have no legal right because the clock ran out.  I have not paid anything on this debt since early 2008 or signed anything regarding this.  

Even though the statue of limitations has ran out, people are reporting that their wages are being garnished for really old debt.  From what I read, you (or your attorney) has to show up in court and actually tell the Judge that the statute of limitations has run out.  Otherwise the Judge usually sides with the collector.

My literal plan was to call them up tomorrow, notify them that I am recording this call and to flat out tell them that their statue of limitations has ran out and even threaten a counter suit of legal fees and lost wages from having to appear in court if they pursue this.",3,1585514028,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frcriv/collections_of_debt_after_statute_of_limitations/,personalfinance,1

frcj6j,spark_ofhope,"My mom passed away yesterday, overwhelmed and unsure what to expect","My mom was in relatively good health and only 55 years old, her passing was sudden and completely unexpected. We had never talked much about her finances and to my knowledge she doesn’t have a will. I’ll provide what information I have and if anyone has any input on things to watch out for or things I may not have thought of, any and all advice is appreciated.

I am an only child,  my parents are divorced, my mom never remarried, and her parents are deceased. According to state law (NH), everything defaults to me, so that’s one less thing to worry about. I am concerned with the courts being closed due to COVID how this process might work, not sure if anyone will have any insight there since it’s such a new situation.

Debt: I do know for a fact she didn’t have any credit cards, so nothing there. She was in the hospital for 2 days preceding her passing. How are the bills for this going to be handled? I read in the wiki that I’m not directly responsible for them, would they come out of her estate? I know she had fairly good insurance through her job, I think with a $2500 deductible, so considered a high deductible plan. Is there anything beyond the deductible that would end up having to be paid?

Accounts: She had a 403b through her job that I am the sole beneficiary of. I’ve already contacted her employer and her manager is going to work with me to get the access I need. Her manager confirmed she did have a life insurance policy as well, I imagine with just me for a beneficiary as well. I would love a more in-depth explanation of what to expect here, especially the 403b. From what I glanced at in the wiki it sounded like this gets converted to an IRA and I become the account holder? I know retirement accounts have been losing value due to the hit the economy is taking right now, would definitely like advice on how to handle this account going forward.

She of course has a checking account, unsure on savings or amounts. What is the process like for getting this turned over to me? (Aside from being a pain, I’m sure).

Assets: She does own a house. It was purchased before I was born, been being paid on consistently for 32 years now. It’s been refinanced a couple times so the term was extended, as far as my dad and I have been able to determine she is still making payments but it must be very nearly paid off. I will be looking to sell it, since I live out of state and the thought of trying to manage a property from 1000 miles away is daunting. I’ve never owned a home before so I’m pretty unfamiliar with most things to do with buying or selling one.

She has a car that was purchased 3 years ago that she is still making payments on, unsure what we’re going to do with this as of yet. My dad is in automotive sales (he sold her the car, actually) and the way he explained it was that if she owes more than it’s worth or close enough to it that we can return the car and the loan will be forgiven. If she has enough equity we can begin the process to get it changed over to my name and try to resell it. This sounded logical enough to me

I’m sorry if this was rambly or if more of this was answered in the wiki. I’m overwhelmed and having an idea of what I’m in for will give me some peace of mind, but I just don’t have it in me to find all the answers on my own. Thank you for any advice you may have to offer.

Edit: some things I forgot.

I’m unsure whether she filed her 2019 taxes or not, is that something I’ll need to do? What about 2020, since she did work a portion of this year?

I’ve already made arrangements with the funeral home as well, which is open right now, just not holding services. They’ll be providing me with copies of the death certificate.

My SO has a 90k private student loan at 11% which we're trying to get refinanced. Monthly payment is about 1200. she also have a 10k car loan with a monthly payment of 320. Her credit score is 770. Annual income around 55k.


One of our friends has given her the 10k cash to pay off the car loan at a 2% interest rate which is much better than the 8% she had beforehand.


The question is: should she pay off the entire car loan right now so that from a bank/refinance perspective, she have no car payment so her debt to income ratio is better? Or does she keep the car loan on there so her credit score remains high (counts as an open account) and then pay it off as soon as the refinancing goes through?

My employer will reimburse me up to $2,500 as well.

If I were to take out a federal loan my employer wouldn’t cover it since I can’t show that I’m paying the college in cash or directly through my checking account.

frbyot,SmilingAtTheSun,Why does your tax bracket in retirement matter for rolling over your 401(k)/Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA,"Quick question for the PF folks. I don't really understand why your tax bracket at retirement matters that much when considering whether to rollover to a Roth IRA.

Here's a hypothetical: A 30 year old has $50,000 in a 401(k) and has a 32% income tax. At retirement, they expect to be in a 22% tax bracket. Say they don't invest any additional funds into the account and it grows to $300,000 (assuming Roth and Traditional grow at the same rate in the long run).

This person can convert to a Roth right now and pay $16k in taxes (50,000 X .32) or they can wait and pay $66k in taxes at retirement (300,000 x .22). Aren't the taxes in retirement going to be higher because the value of the account is so much higher?

I feel like I'm missing something fundamental. Thank you for taking the time to read!",16,1585511270,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frbyot/why_does_your_tax_bracket_in_retirement_matter/,personalfinance,4

frburg,HAMCJJHSEKSE,Looking for advice on a kids saving account,"Hello, My wife and I have a year and a half year old, with another baby on the way due in Aug. when our first child was born we decided that we should start a savings account for our kids. We decided we should put 1000 bucks a year into an account, as well as any gifted money to our children. We currently have 2900 dollars in the account thanks to our monthly contribution of 85 $ from our checking account and money that has been gifted to our child. We want this money to be able to buy anything our kids might need throughout life. For instance, we bought a 200$ car seat and various other baby stuff with this money. We also plan on having 3 kids, and want to be able to buy all 3 of them cars when they are 16. So we figured at least, with 1000 bucks a year, by the time out oldest is 16, thats 16,000$ not counting any other contributions. 

So now we’ve began to think about investing this money. Neither of us are very sharp on investing, but have a general understanding and basic knowledge. Someone recommended a Vangaurd Wellington fund, which was explained to me to be 60% stock 40%bonds. So instead of having 16,000 in 16 years, we could have a substantial amount more. We want to be able to pull money out whenever we want, for hopefully no fee. Idk if this is possible? But lets say we want to buy one of our kids the best of the best football pads for like 300 dollars, or buy our kids a new instrument for 400, or maybe a new gaming system for christmas some year, we want to be able to use this money for all things kids stuff. And maybe some college tuition costs if it grows enough. Were not including diapers, daycare or basically anything we know we can afford out of checking. Is there an investment account that will let you pull out your money any time without a fee? Is the Vangaurd Wellington account a good account for us? We just want to make sure that were getting the most out of our money. We dont need to be super aggressive or do any day trading, just want to try and invest. 

 I’m used to understanding things like 401k or Roth IRA’s. Like roth ira is pre tax money, 401k will charge you a fee if you pull it out before a certain age, etc...I don’t know a whole lot about other types of investment accounts so any insight is helpful. I looked into a 529 plan, but i don’t like that because I believe you can only use that money for educational purposes. So can anyone help point us in the right direction here? Does the vangaurd wellington fund sound like the right one for what we want? Am I missing any information on taxation? Our money we would be putting in would come straight from our checking account, so taxes would already be paid on the money we are putting in. Thanks in advance for any replies. I know this is in pretty ‘laymans’ terms, but We would love to have some advice. And I’m sure we could just call Vangaurd and get all the info we want from them. But i just figured Id ask here first.

frbh9z,EmergFundHealthPelot,Acceptable Reasons To Use Emergency Fund,"My spouse and I have met all of our saving goals and feel comfortable with our monthly expenses. We are gradually increasing our savings over time. As a part of that, we have set aside the amount required to pay our out of pocket max for insurance ($5200) in our health emergency savings bucket (and have separate buckets which are met for car, house, dog, general).

I've been focusing on my health (due to high cholesterol) and was regularly spending $200 a month on cycling classes to lose weight (4-5 times a week). Yes, I know it is pricey but I've found that I need a certain specific environment to workout (ex: inside due to awful allergies, team so that I get competitive, cardio since lunking around weights doesn't do it for me). The approach has been successful and since August of 2019, I've been able to lose about 3 pounds a month through diet and exercise which has reduced my high cholesterol.

Given the recent changes in our state, gyms are no longer open until who knows when and this means that I'm not able to get in my normal cycling routine. I'm nervous about relapsing into my old carb loving ways and am trying to figure out options so that I can continue to lose weight. One of the options that I've talked about with my spouse has been buying a Peloton bike ($2400ish for bike then $40 a month for subscription).

My spouse and I are both in stable positions where we don't have concerns about losing our jobs. I plan to start allocating funds towards this as a savings goal but I'm seeing the impacts of lack of exercise on my health now. If I bought the bike, I would no longer enroll in cycling classes and that money would go towards the bike. I am comfortable with this but I believe I would want to get the bike now (now meaning 2-4 weeks when delivered). In order to do that, I'm considering taking a loan with myself from my emergency fund to pay for this bike. I plan to pay this back over time ($200 a mont) and will likely charge myself some interest to discourage this kind of behavior again. I prefer to be my own evil banker.

For those of you with emergency funds, how do you handle/designate emergencies? For weird instances like this where money is required so that you can avoid future emergencies (ex: heart attack due to high cholesterol so instead fund preventative measures like weight loss), how do you justify if an expense or loan of this sort is appropriate? Does anyone have any advice regarding this?

tldr: I am fat and need to lose weight. Expensive bike works for me. How do you justify touching emergency fund to do it?",24,1585509607,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/frbh9z/acceptable_reasons_to_use_emergency_fund/,personalfinance,1

Amidst the chaos, I'm lucky that as a public school teacher I should not be suffering any changes to my salary. This fall, I will be starting a 2-year grad school program full time and working as a graduate assistant. My GA is covering all but a few of my credits for completion of the program and I'll be paid a small stipend as well.

I have enough in savings to cover my cost of living for the next two years while I'm in school, but it will take nearly all of my savings (except for a bit in retirement that I will not be touching). The only debt I have is a manageable amount (less than $25k) from undergrad all in federal loans. With them being at 0% interest and payments not required for the next 6 months, here's what I'm weighing: A) continuing to pay my minimum payment so that I can pay down the prinicpal quite a bit or B) paying a little less than my minimum payment during this time so I can build more of a cushion in my savings for during grad school.

frbfe2,poster_978,Inheritance Planning,"Hi all - my Grandma passed away recently, and I was lucky enough to inherit some money.  My husband and I are weighing options, and I wanted to post here for additional recommendations/perspectives.  Here are some basic details:

Ages: 37 and 40

Retirement savings: $20,000 in various retirement accounts combined

Combined annual salary (gross): $110,000

Savings: None to speak up currently- but it’s been a rough couple months.  We can normally keep around $1k in savings- but definitely no “emergency fund”

No kids, reliable car, decent jobs, comfortable condo

Debts:

Mortgage: $155,000

HELOC: $20,000

Outstanding taxes: $8,000

Student loans: $50,000

I will be inheriting around $280,000 liquid funds, and $120,000 in a Roth IRA.  

Our crazy dream would be to use the liquid funds to pay off all of our debts, put about 10k in a money market account as an emergency fund, and invest the remaining 37k in growth accounts.  We would keep our jobs, keep living the life we’ve lived thus far, and use the extra $ each month to increase our savings for future things like beefing up retirement accounts, travel, etc.  

I’d love to hear people’s reaction to that plan.  Receiving this windfall of cash is an amazing opportunity to potentially change the trajectory of our lives.  We’d like to be as responsible as we can with it, and make choices that will benefit us for years to come.  We’re happy with our current lives, and don’t foresee wanting to move or upgrade anything big for the foreseeable future.  Obviously, a lot of this comes down to personal opinions - I’m trying to weigh our options and be responsible so all perspectives welcomed.

C) Side business where I run a YouTube channel for automotive projects and get a 1099-misc. I would have an intent to be profitable and I don't think I'd have any issues justifying it as a business and not a hobby.

B is profitable every year. The only write-offs I take are the standard home office, computer upgrades, software, etc. I usually end up owing $1000 - $1500 when it's all said and done.

C is a new project I'm considering starting up that would initially cost me $5000-$8000 in materials, tools, and equipment to create content for the YouTube channel. Realistically I don't expect to break even the first year from ad revenue or merchandise.

Since I don't have an official business entity for B or C, do all the income and expenses get lumped together? IE, could the expenses from C help lower my taxable income for B? Would there be any benefit to combining the two into a legal entity?

Should I file for bankruptcy?,"I have around 8k debt spread across 6 credit cards all with APRs in the mid 20's. 2 of them are 60 days late as of today. My credit was fine until I stopped paying most of my cards for around 2 months so that i could pay 3k that i owed in tuition so i could go to university this semester. I live and go to school in Washington DC

My credit is currently around 530. I work a part time retail job and go to school full time. I also donate plasma 2 times a week which covers all my weekly living expenses as I live with family and only pay about 200$ in rent. I make around 1000 a month and pretty much all of it goes to credit card payments, tuition payments or food. I don't spend money on frivolous things. Due to Corona I'm out of work. I dont have the means to keep paying my credit cards. And even when I start work again I'm tired of living off ramen noodles and in constant anxiety. I feel like in my current state I'll never be able to pay off this debt.

 I still have another 2 to 3years to go in university. I wont be making any kind of significant income until I graduate. Should I stop paying the credit cards and/or file for bankruptcy? I'm going to be studying abroad for a year. My parents are sponsoring me so I wont be making any income starting July.

fraqvg,financialplanthrow,I Know Nothing...Literally Nothing. Book Recs?,"Hi Reddit,

Throwaway 'cause I'm embarrassed.

I'm 34(m) years old. I fucked up a bit in my early twenties, jumping from job to job until I got my shit together, got an advanced degree in public health, and am now making good money. I was a little late, but I graduated, accepted some low paying jobs, threw all my extra money into paying off my debt and am now completely debt-free, no student loans. 

Well, I got a new job two months ago before all this shit hit the fan, and I'm really lucky. I went from making barely enough money to pay off my debts and save to overnight being well into the 6-figure range. I've set up a 401k but I realize, I don't know anything about saving money. 

I mean, I know about saving, I have a savings account, and I've got about 120k in it. But when I mentioned this to my friend, he freaked out and was surprised I had basically nothing as far as retirement and investments go. Hence my embarrassment.

Guys, I have no idea what I'm doing. Suddenly, I'm having to learn about stocks and bonds and investment portfolios and an IRA and 401k and I feel so lost and embarrassed. I went to the Wiki and all it did was make me feel overwhelmed. I think I also have some undiagnosed ADHD going on, too, so that probably doesn't help either.

I've asked my boyfriend for help, but he is kind of a genius at this and has a hard time explaining it in a way where I understand it. Does anyone have any book recommendations or anything that will explain this like I'm 5? Or a complete moron (which I am, let's be fair)? Someone suggest Dave Ramsey, but I read his Total Money Makeover book and felt like it didn't really help me. I don't have any debt anymore and he seems to kinda help people who are in serious trouble (I could have used him ten years ago maybe).

So anyone want to help a 34-year-old moron who never learned any of these financial terms? Or at least point him in the right direction?",13,1585507061,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fraqvg/i_know_nothingliterally_nothing_book_recs/,personalfinance,0

When I calculated it out it seems it's just not factoring in the standard deduction. I assumed it would be factored in as I didn't include any itemized deductions. However, looking back on the w4 I filled out there seems to be no way to claim it.

When I was 22, I created a traditional IRA at someone's advice and put a gift of $5000 in it. I made a few hundred something contibutions here and there, and now am too broke to contribute for at least a a few years (and have been too broke to contribute for a while now). 

I'm almost 28 and every adult I trust is asking why I stupidly did a traditional in the first place telling me to convert it to a Roth ASAP. I'm being told to take the tax hit now while I have such little income.

The account was initally opened for me with American Funds by a family friend's ""financial guy"" who said he would take 1%. My sister told me I didn't need anyone watching it for me and to ""take it away"" from him and switch it to Vanguard, which I did. 

I don't have any other investments or ANYTHING. No 401k (worked overseas and paid into foreign pensions). I don't want to pay a bunch of tax on this when I'm 65. I want to put already taxed income into it and collect everything at the end.

I started my Roth IRA in 2014 and my wife started hers in 2016. We both used USAA for everything at the time and started an account in UCAGX (they told us both there would be NO charges when they made trades because it’s a USAA fund, how nice of them! /s). I now understand expense ratios and how bad off we are. 

I’ve done lots of research across this subreddit and pretty well decided on wanting to move to vanguard (long history of no fees, low expense ratios, good customer care) and I personally want to be in an S&amp;P500 index fund (so I’m thinking VTSAX). As I understand it, I want to open a vanguard account and do a transfer in kind from USAA to Vanguard. Then I want to do a fund transfer from UCAGX to VTSAX. This will allow the transfer to be non-taxable. I do understand there’s a $70 transfer fee from USAA.

Ive done lots of reading old posts on this subject in the subreddit, but just wanted to pose this whole scenario to the community to make sure I have a strong and correct understanding of the terminology, fees/tax situations, and am generally on the right path for my goal as it seems like different situations can get nuanced fast.

So I'm trying to decide if it's worth it to refinance.  I'm currently a year and a half in a 30yr 3/5 ARM that is at 5.25%.  The original loan amount was for 87k and its down to 79.5k.  The payment with escrow is $690 and I always pay 1k a month no matter what.  I'm currently in a refinance with a different lender for a 3.125% 15yr conventional rate.  I have already locked my rate when I paid $480 for the appraisal.  However, closing costs are way higher than they estimated me at first which is now at 4k.  With the new loan my payments and escrow would be around $800 and I would still make 1k payments.  So, really I am just trying to figure out if it's worth it to drop all this money up front to lock into a better rate since I am paying quite a bit more every month anyways.

They are now using corona virus as an excuse to cut the pay of certain employees for the next 6 months by 50 percent “to ensure we don’t have to do any layoffs”. I am now making less than most of the people in the company and still expected to manage them and do 80+ hours each week to make sure the company survives.


For me this is survivable, I have low expenses and have 6 months emergency savings but it’s a big sacrifice with no guanatee that I will be brought back to my actual salary or that I won’t just get laid off if things get better (or that the company won’t just fail and we’re all out of a job). Company owners are already rich and I do not trust them to do right by any of us, they have been scummy in other ways before.

They do have a stock program and I already have some vested. When we were told that we needed to take the cut they said “take it or leave”. I asked about additional shares to make up for the lost income or accelerated vesting of our other shares and they said “we’ll think about it”. But I don’t think they will give it up.

fr9ada,HelpMeAvoidTaxes,Can I (NY Resident) claim the payments toward my debt to my parents as tax deductible by contributing to my siblings’ (NJ Residents) 529 account(s)?,"Hello! I am 21 years old and have a good paying job and it’s time for me to begin knocking out my student loans. I owe a private student loan agency 30,000 at 4.54% APR over 10 years and my parents 30,000 at 0% APR with the plan being to match the monthly payment made to the private loan agency for my parents each month. This would be roughly $324 per month to my parents, $3,888 per year. 

According to [this website](https://www.policygenius.com/blog/a-state-by-state-guide-to-529-plans/) New York residents can claim up to $5,000 of their contributions to a NY sponsored 529 plan per year as tax deductible. If I (a soon to be NY Resident) open a 529 account for my brother (a current **New Jersey Resident**) can I claim my contributions as tax deductible? My brother already has a 529 account my parents opened for him in NJ, I am wondering about opening a new one in NY. 

If not, are there any other ways for me to pay my parents back this ~4K a year and reduce my taxable income?

fr99jk,F-Rex1994,Age 25 - new to the investing world! Any advice for a newbie?,"Hi guys

I would be grateful if you could advise me on the below investment strategy:

Age 25, currently earning £50,000. I am planning on putting £600 per month into a stocks &amp; shares ISA after an initial investment of £5000. 

I have an emergency fund of £15,000 and I will also be adding £4000 per year into a Lifetime ISA. Moreover, I have a workplace pension of 5% which is matched by the employer. 

The funds I am planning on initially investing in are noted below: 

1. Legal &amp; General International Index Trust - 40%

2. Lindsell Train Global Equity - 30%

3. Legal &amp; General Global Technology Index - 20%

4. IShares Overseas Government Bond Index - 10%. 

In 2 years my salary will increase to £120,000 and I will aim to invest approximately £3,500 per month. I will then diversify my portfolio further to hold more cash/bonds as the plan is to purchase a commercial property in the next 5 years. 

I appreciate any comments/criticisms that you may have on the above .

fr91l1,fersthrowaway,Am I an idiot for wanting to cash out my FERS contributions?,"I'm 30, recently separated from the federal government, and have several options to consider regarding what to do with my FERS contributions. At 4.4% of my salary during these past 5.5 years, my FERS contributions are in the $15k-$20k range. Here are the rough numbers.

&gt;Annuity:  1 percent of your high-3 average salary for each year of service (FYI, I do not plan to return to federal service).  At \~100k and 5.5 years, the annuity would be $5.5k/year.  
&gt;  
&gt;TSP/Roth: Transferring/investing $20k to my TSP/Roth would have a 30-year return of \~$300k, optimistically assuming average gains of 10%/year; or \~$150k at 7%/year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cash Out: $20k in hand

I know the answer seems obvious: screw the annuity and invest it in TSP/Roth; however, I am headed to a top MBA program and will likely make significantly more money from graduation to retirement. The dilemma is that I am weighing the intangibles of how much my quality of life will improve by having an extra $20k available during school versus having an extra $150k-$300k at retirement. I will not be working during these 2 years at school and currently have about $30k spread across various checking/savings accounts. I should also mention that I will not have to worry about paying tuition/fees so it will just be cost of living (I expect rent will be about $1500/month) and fun stuff (eating out, bars, travel). I am leaning towards cashing out, but I wanted to see if someone would be able to convince me that I'm being an idiot or has any advice on what to do.",23,1585501067,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fr91l1/am_i_an_idiot_for_wanting_to_cash_out_my_fers/,personalfinance,2

fr8wok,ilikethatdrop,IRA recharacterization in TurboTax,"I contributed $6,000 to my Roth IRA at Vanguard in 2019. In Feb 2020 I realized I was over the income limit and called Vanguard to recharacterize to a Traditional IRA (and then convert back to a Roth IRA). At the time there were $200 of earnings, so they recharacterized $6,200 to a Traditional IRA and then converted all $6,200 back to my Roth IRA.

I'm trying to determine if it matters that the recharacterization happened in Feb 2020, and not in 2019, and how to report it in TurboTax. Under Deductions &amp; Credits, I'm currently entering the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution, then indicating that I recharacterized $6,000 to a Traditional IRA, and adding a statement about the $6,200 transferred (the contribution plus the $200 of earnings).

Am I recording this correctly?

Where should I be reporting the $200 of earnings (and calculate the penalty), or will I need to do that for 2020 taxes instead?

Is it correct to show the $6,000 on lines 1,3, and 14 for form 8606 to keep track of the non-deductible Traditional IRA basis, even though the recharacterization took place in early 2020?

 I was expecting to owe 9800 dollars or so on the balance, but the balance is STILL 11300 after the 1500 payment but, the payoff estimate went down to 9800. What gives?

How does it make any sense for the payoff estimate to be LOWER than my balance on the loan? 

This is the first time I'm seeing this, I think it might be an error or a glitch. What do you guys think?

My lease is up June 9, and I need to give them 60 days notice soon. There’s no mention of exceptions to this deadline in the lease contract. My company is moving to the other side of the city in June so I need to move at some point. I still work in the office half the time. If the office still manages to move this summer, it will be a shorter commute (maybe only 25 minutes each way) because of the lack of traffic. However, I have a dog who I need to let out during lunch time and dog daycares are closed. My parents are willing to look after him, but they are elderly.

I'm having trouble touring apartments right now because understandably, leasing offices are closed or operating at a pretty limited capacity. Even though my first-choice, prospective apartment is responding quickly, they can’t allow tours right now. There are social distancing mandates in my city so I completely understand. They are sending me more pictures, they’re great and I’ve had my eye on this place for months. But I much rather tour the place even if I only get to see a model unit.

I’ve been emailing and left my current leasing office a voicemail about short term renewal options with no success. They are working from home and still sending out emails but I imagine they are overwhelmed with residents who lost their jobs and other issues. They finally sent me a generic email, reminding me to put in my 60 days notice or renew at a Covid-related discount ($100 cheaper per month). In response, I kindly asked again about short term renewals.

What should I do if I fail to sign a short term lease renewal? I’m thinking of just letting lease renew for another 12 months even though I dislike my apartment. I also plan to leave my company within the next few years.

I am looking for some investment advice, and what to do with some extra money. I want to outline my background and situation so some of this might be pretty dry.

I am a 34 year old male who owns his own business. I currently have a Simple IRA that has about $75,000 in it. With the virus, this has gone down quite a bit. It was around $100,000.

I have another 120k in a savings account in my bank. And I have about another $150k that is mine, in my business bank. 

I have a finance guy, an accountant, and multiple lawyers. This part I suppose is just to shed light that I frequently use advisors to make decisions. 

What should I do with the 120k I have in savings? This is the money I feel is moveable right now for the right reason. The 150k in my business bank I'd prefer to keep there for now, but give me a reason and I'll move it. I'm nervous that maybe I should dump some of it into the market. I have never traded by myself. I just opened a TD Ameritrade account, and I downloaded Robinhood.

Or, do I do something else entirely? Do I start looking at potential passive income businesses I could purchase? Car wash? Laundromat?

I've already maxed out the employer matching on my 401(k) and I feel safe with the amount of cash I have on hand to weather emergencies.

So, as opportunistic as this might be, during this time of global economic downturn, is now the perfect time to open an IRA and invest more for the future?

If so, what should my next steps be? Should I put in the maximum $6000 right away, or would it be more prudent to put that money in piece-meal, like $1000 per month for six months?

Given my lengthy investment horizon, I'm very amenable to risk right now, and I'd like an investment blend that reflects that. I don't think I'm interested in trading on individual companies, or even sectors; from what I've read and researched, investments like those don't do much better than diversified funds.

So in light of that, do I want to go exclusively into index/mutual/exchange-traded funds? What's the difference between those three things, as far as I should care? And what should my considerations be in terms of growth vs value vs blended funds, and in terms of small-cap vs med-cap vs large-cap, and in terms of domestic vs international investments?

My family lives comfortably (140k/year) but I do not get support from them  

Anyway, my rent is 1k (midtown manhattan w roommates) and I try to pay 1.5k a month to my loans (I think my plan is only $800 though). I net ~4300 a month and saving is also really important to me so I try to limit my spending as much as possible. For example, I ate rice for lunch all week at work and coworkers were like WTF? Im a picky eater and it is a good way to save money.

I limit myself to go out one day a week, never shop for new clothes, refuse to move into a bigger apt even if it is only $200-$300 more a month because that is money I should be saving - space is not a luxury I need as a 22 year old 

If I get my hair done, I do it on groupon. I found almost all my furniture on fb marketplace or just outside nice apt buildings.

The thing is, im never cheap when it comes to other people and I always am happy to splurge on gifts, treat my BF, friends for their bday, etc but never on myself. In fact, I try to limit my spending so I can splurge on these moments. 

My friends all make less money than me and tell me I am crazy and cheap. I have 15k in savings (just in case I lose my job - I KNOW i should put it towards debt but I feel as if I need a buffer just in case, especially during these times).

fr8267,3idRaven,Opinions on paying off mortgage,"I’m about 6 years into a 30 year mortgage. At the time of purchasing the home I didn’t have a huge budget but I wanted to lock down the super low rate at the time, so what I ended up buying is a starter house.  Eventually me and my wife and hypothetical kids will probably outgrow this house. 

My question is, is it worth paying extra towards principal knowing I’m unlikely to ever finish the 30 year mortgage and will probably upgrade to something with higher payments and start over on a new mortgage eventually?

Anyway, my rent is 1k (midtown manhattan w roommates) and I try to pay 1.5k a month to my loans. I net ~4300 a month and saving is also really important to me so I try to limit my spending as much as possible. For example, I ate rice for lunch all week at work and coworkers were like WTF? Im a picky eater and it is a good way to save money.

I limit myself to go out one day a week, never shop for new clothes, refuse to move into a bigger apt even if it is only $200-$300 more a month because that is money I should be saving - space is not a luxury I need as a 22 year old 

If I get my hair done, I do it on groupon. I found almost all my furniture on fb marketplace or just outside nice apt buildings.

The thing is, im never cheap when it comes to other people and I always am happy to splurge on gifts, treat my BF, friends for their bday, etc but never on myself. In fact, I try to limit my spending so I can splurge on these moments. 

My friends all make less money than me and tell me I am crazy and cheap. I have 15k in savings (just in case I lose my job - I KNOW i should put it towards debt but I feel as if I need a buffer just in case, especially during these times).

fr7tsa,pour_the_tea,Landlord wants to raise rent on NYC apartment,"Hi everyone, I posted this on a sub about renting also but I wanted to post here because I feel like everyone here is really knowledgeable. Let me know if this isn't allowed.

I need some advice about my lease renewal. I'm going to try to explain this as best as I can but I really don't have a good grasp on all these legal concepts. I live in an apartment in NYC that I am 99% sure is rent stabilized. My lease has all the riders attached for a rent stabilized building and my building is on the city's list for rent stabilized buildings. I'm currently paying a little bit below market value for a 1 bed room in a nice area that's been increasing in value for the last 10 years. I've been in this apartment since September 2019 and my lease ends at the end of August 2020. My landlord just sent me a renewal offer in the mail that raises my rent by over $250 a month. This would bring me closer to market value for the area, however it seems like this is a big jump. There have been no major improvements and the renewal offer doesn't have an explanation for the increase. I know that theres a cap on rent stabilized buildings that's supposed to be at market value so I think that they can charge this much for the apartment. But I also heard there were some very recent changes in the law that means they can't raise rent by a large jump if you've already been getting a ""preferential"" rent below market value. I don't actually know if my rent now is considered preferential and it's my understanding that a landlord might not tell you if it is. I need to submit the offer 90 days before the lease is up so thats around the end of May which means I have some time to figure it out. The mayor of NYC has also been saying that he may put a rent freeze on rent stabilized buildings that would prohibit landlords from raising the rent at all due to Covid-19. Are they trying to get me to sign something unfair before a rent freeze would take effect and hoping that I won't know what I'm entitled to in terms of preferential rent? I know that landlords often raise rent every year it just seems like $250 a month is a lot. I've also been asking them to get an exterminator and they haven't, and I called 311 on them once because my water was turned off without notice and I couldn't get a hold of the super or anyone to tell me anything. Are they just trying to get me out of the building with a price increase as retaliation? This is my first apartment on my own and I do not understand all the  legal language or what I'm entitled to. Any help or advice would be nice.

I make $3,911 net income each month. The university puts and amount equal to 10% of my gross income into a 401k, I put 2% into a 403b, and this year I have began investing an additional 10% of my net into index funds. I finally took the advice of paying myself first!

I was planning to budget about a month without a car, so I can really take my time and hunt for a car in good condition and at a good price. However, I'm seeing the rates for renting a car for a month are about $900 at the lowest.

Filed for unemployment, but haven’t started receiving benefits yet. Think the paperwork had a slight hang up, but hopefully those will start this week. The Coronavirus has put a wrench in my job search, and I might have to go back to TN and stay with my folks for a while until all this blows over. I’m $35,000 in debt and CA is too expensive to live in unless I have a decent salaried job. I’m working on building up some skills to get one of those - was working in a work from home tech job previously. I’d prefer a remote job so I can be more mobile. 

If I go back to TN, can I still receive benefits from CA? They pay nearly twice what I would get from TN, which can be very handy for my bills while I work on getting that salaried job. I’ve heard two different things that you have to transfer the UI to the new state, or you can continue to make claims in the original state of employment even if you live in another state. I don’t want to be caught for fraud, so does anyone know what I should do?

They state there that the stimulus will be based on 2019 taxes so you should file with them ASAP. This doesn't seem to be true don't feel pressured to file and then pay their fees.  


The bill states:  


“(g) Advance Refunds And Credits.—

“(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (5), each individual who was an eligible individual for such individual’s first taxable year beginning in 2018 shall be treated as having made a payment against the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such first taxable year in an amount equal to the advance refund amount for such taxable year.

 “(5) ALTERNATE TAXABLE YEAR.—In the case of an individual who, at the time of any determination made pursuant to paragraph (3), has not filed a tax return for the year described in paragraph (1), the Secretary may apply such paragraph by substituting ‘2019’ for ‘2018’.

fr6i18,capersiste,"Parents' accountant wrongly claimed me as dependent in 2019, I can't paper file to correct this because of lockdown in my country... will I not eligible for the stimulus check?","To give a bit of context: In 2019, I was 25 years old and attending my last semester of graduate school in a foreign country. During that time, I was working part-time for 3 months (Feb - April), and full time for 8 months (May - December).

Recently, I was trying to file my 2019 taxes in order to ensure that I could file as independent before the stimulus package benefits gets calculated for everyone. However, my mother told me not to as her accountant claimed me as a dependent child (this is important) on her taxes. However, this is a problem because:

1) Dependent children must be 24 or younger, I was 25 in 2019.

2) I do not qualify as a dependent relative either, as I made well over the $4,200 limit for dependent relatives.

As I am living abroad, I file my taxes online (through Turbo Tax). The problem that I'm running into is that, from what I've read online, my e-file will be automatically rejected because my SSN has already been declared as dependent (against my will, and for which I am not eligible) and I will be requested to file my taxes on paper. However, I am currently living in a country that is on total lockdown (France), and all post offices within a 1km radius of my apartment are closed (we are not legally allowed to go farther than 1km from our houses due to government-mandated lockdown measures). Therefore, the only way I can get my taxes filed right now is... you guessed it, by asking my parents to mail them in. However, my parents are refusing to mail them off until their accountant files an amendment to their taxes, which he can't do for the next few weeks because he's busy, because they're scared they'll get audited and they don't trust the accountant hasn't made more errors on their taxes. This effectively means that my stimulus eligibility will be calculated based on my 2018 filing status, which was dependent (as I was a full-time student at that time, didn't work, and was filed as a dependent child).

What recourse do I have? Am I just out of luck in this situation, or is there another way that I can ensure that my stimulus benefits will be calculated based on my current situation? I've exhausted Google search about a million times, but I can't find another situation similar enough to mine to figure out what my best options are.",1,1585491314,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fr6i18/parents_accountant_wrongly_claimed_me_as/,personalfinance,1

Not sure if this is the right place to help me, but I am looking for financial advice.

I make 35k a year and bring home 880 dollars bi-weekly. I have 5.5k saved up. I also plumbing on the side with my dad. Usually make 100 bucks on the weekend.

I want a VW Golf R. I have been driving a 09 nissan rogue and it's been showing its age. Still drives, but I personally. Believe it's time to switch it up.

The Golf R costs about 42k brand new. Used models hardly depreciate. I have seen some going up to 75k in miles for 25k+ in dollars. Hell ive seen some slightly used ones with 5k miles on them going for full retail price.

This has been my dream car for years now. Maintenance is easy and my insurance company said that it would only add 50 bucks over 6 months to my insurance, which I can afford. The issue here is that idk what I am doing when it comes to buying a new car and what I should be watching out for in terms of finances. 

How much money should I have saved for this and what can I do to have payment around 350 max?

No, I dont want a different car nor will I look into a different car. I know what I want and the Golf R is it.

fr5xoo,touchmefeelme,Switching to Bi-Weekly with a Twist,"I switched my mortgage to automatic payments every 2 weeks (bi-weekly), so I will be making 1 extra payment a year. However, my lending company does not apply the payment until the full monthly payment has been met. So, does this negate the financial benefit of paying every 2 weeks because the interest is still accruing until the full balance is paid? My research tells me yes and the only benefit to bi-weekly is budgeting a partial payment every two weeks and it helps make 13 yearly mortgage payments instead of the usual 12. 

I already pay extra principal each month, so would it be better for me to go back to paying the full monthly balance at the beginning of the month and adding my extra principal later in the month. I'll be sure to budget to add the full extra monthly payment and add that in by the end of the year as another extra payment on the principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the alternative twist: We have the ability to pay double the mortgage every month - which we plan to do whether or not we are on bi-weekly or monthly. What if we set up our bi-weekly to be the minimum payment and so then every two weeks we are technically paying the minimum mortgage. Will this save us on interest rates since we are ""restarting"" the interest accruing every two weeks?

fr5wwa,4fingersleft,where to invest life insurance proceeds for elderly mother,"Hi - My father passed away in February. He left my mother a small estate of mainly variable annuities and several life insurance policies. Most everything is under a local investment company.  He was invested in Franklin Templeton , John Hancock, and Pacific Life. No, I don't know why this company or why they invested with these companies. My father was 91 and that generation didn't talk about money with their family, especially children. 

My mother is 89, while she's mentally alert she doesn't know, have the comprehension, or desire to deal with finances at this point. We have power of attorneys and she will agree to do whatever we suggest. We're in the process of hiring an elder law lawyer for estate planning and medicaid application so that she doesn't have to spend all of her approximately $300K money to the nursing home.

So the question is several life insurance policies will be cashed in worth about $120K total. I screwed in reverse and started the redemption process outside of the investment company. :) Of course, the investment firm wants us to reinvest the money with them in a bond  fund of some sort. I'm inclined to open an account in her name with Vanguard (lower fees ...). I'm tempted just to put the money in a money market type of fund since she shouldn't be exposed to any market fluctuation at this point in her life. But would a fed. gov't. bond fund also be appropriate? What kind of fund would be appropriate for a 89 yr. old with a life expectancy in the 5-10 year range more than likely?

I work for a rather large, about 80 employees, restaurant. We are currently still open during this time but only for take out. Our employer has offered to keep everyone employed, because they view us as a family, but at an averaged over the last 8 weeks hours at minimum wage, which for me is 30hrs getting $220. All they are asking is that you put in some time cleaning or running the take out window for about 8 hours a week. They also originally told me that if I went for unemployment that I would not be eligible for rehire, which should be more money then what they are offering. They did not say this to everyone and I attempted to get them to put this in writing but they would only talk to me over phone and did not mention it to me again when I spoke to them later. Now with the new Federal Cares Act offering an extra $600 a week to all people on unemployment, they have not said anything. I now have it in writing that if any employee goes for unemployment, rehire would be by a person by person basis. This is not the first time my employer has done shady/unethical things. I had a new job lined up but has since been taken back due to this outbreak and I need to make sure I will have employment once this is all over.

I feel my employer should be doing the partial unemployment claim for all employees so we can pay our bills and also begin receiving the federal bump. Thank you in advance for all advice.

fr5ohk,Megnuggets,Filing taxes with w2 from IRS,So I had to contact the IRS this year because my previous employer had the wrong adress on file (though it came to the right adress last year no issues) and i did not receive my w2. The IRS sent one out for me. It doesnt quite look like the ones I usually get but it has the numbers I need. Except it doesnt have the cents listed. When I go to file on my tax prep app it asks for the cents on the amounts for wages and such. Would it be ok to put it as .00 cents with the accurate dollar amount (I dont want to claim more than im owed)? I dont want to mess up my taxes. But I also assumed if it was super important the IRS would have put it on there. What would be the best thing to do in this situation? Thank you for all of your help and replys.

fr5nq6,Zebal1228,(US) Using Parent's Cash For Stock Investments,"
TL;DR
I know there are capital gains taxes after I invest my parents money into stocks. I want to do all the work for them by taking ""dumb money"" they have laying around their house by putting it into stocks but not have any tax impacts on me by moving their money around.



Basically, I am trying to help my dad invest money into stocks instead of having it laying around his house. The first problem is that is in foreign currencies. He has a crap ton! I have convinced him to let me help expand his portfolio and invest.

I have the first problem solved as there are currency liquidators that exchange with a fee of around 10-20% depending on if the bills are circulated or uncirculated. I sent the minimum amount to test the legitimacy of it, $200, and it worked. Cash USD was sent back which I found odd, but the liquidator said under 1k is cash, 1-5k is a check, and over $5k is a check or wire. Not sure what percent I took from his stash but it is ball park $20k. 

So here is my rub and I want any advice that can help guide me. Once converted to USD and the money is wired to an account is there anything tax related I need to be worried about or max amounts that can be deposited to a bank in one wire? I know $10,000 is like a magic number you want to stay under on bank deposits per day all the movies I have watched. Anything over this is flagged by IRS, police, or someone you do not want looking over your shoulder.

I would not think there are tax implications as I could pull $100 from my checking account and then put it back later. I have just never dealt with such a large volume of liquid before.

I wanted to make a fidelity brokerage account for them. I just made one myself to put my Regions savings to use on travel stocks that have gotten battered. They recently added me on one of there business accounts (small LLC for managing a small trailer park they still own). I was thinking perhaps I can wire it to that account and then send it to the Fidelity brokerage account I make for them.",11,1585487381,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fr5nq6/us_using_parents_cash_for_stock_investments/,personalfinance,1
fr5m50,d_rek,Be aware of MLMs in times of financial crisis,"A neighbor on our road who we are somewhat close with recently sprung a MLM pitch (Primerica) on us out of the blue. This neighbor is currently gainfully employed as a nurse so the sales pitch was even that much more alarming, and awkward, for us. 

The neighbor has been aggressively pitching my wife for the last week via social media (posts on my wife’s accounts and DMing her all the amazing “benefits” of this job) until I went over there and talked to the couple. 

Unfortunately they didn’t seem repentant or even aware that they were involved in a low-level pyramid scheme, even after I mentioned they should look into the company more closely. Things got awkward and I left cordially but told them not to contact my wife anymore about working for them. 

Anyway... I saw this pattern play out in 2008-2011 when people were hard up for money. I’m not sure I need to educate any of the subs members on why MLMs suck, but lets look out for friends and family who may be targeted by MLM recruiters so that they don’t make anyone’s life more difficult than it has to be during a time when many are already experiencing financial hardship.

fr4v68,isealbz,Am I entering my 1098-T into TurboTax Free File correctly?,"I am a PhD student. Ordinarily, my university pays me to work as a Teaching Assistant, and this income is reported on a W-2 form.

However, in Spring 2019, I was awarded a fellowship that included a stipend, tuition/fees contribution, and money for health insurance. Moreover, in Fall 2019, I was awarded $2,100 for teaching the first month of a course when the professor fell ill. All of this information was reported on a 1098-T form rather than a W-2 form.

Before I enter my 1098-T information into TurboTax Free File, it indicates that I will receive a $732 federal refund. After I follow TurboTax's instructions, however, that amount decreases to $23. Am I entering the information correctly?

The crucial steps seem to be:

1. Click ""Yes"" to ""Did you have any higher education expenses in 2019?"" 
2. Click ""Add a Student"" and click ""Yes"" to ""Did you get a 1098-T for the year 2019?""
3. Upload my 1098-T PDF. 
4. TurboTax automatically enters the following: $12,812.62 for Box 1; $0.00 for Box 4; $28,314.00 for Box 5; Box 7 (""Box 1 includes amounts for an academic period beginning January - March 2020"") is unchecked; Box 8 (""At least half-time student"") is checked; Box 9 (""Graduate student"") is checked; Box 10 (""Insurance contract reimbursement refund"") is unchecked. 
5. Click ""Yes"" to ""Did You Receive Any of the Following Tax-Free Benefits Last Year? GI Bill benefits, Veterans' benefits, tax free employer provided assistance.""
6. It asks me, ""What portion of the $28,314 from Box 5 on your 1098-T is from veterans' benefits and/or tax-free employer provided assistance?"" I enter $8,681, which is the sum of the amounts listed under ""Tuition waivers and exemptions"" on my 1098-T (see below).
7. Click ""Yes"" to ""Did You Receive a Scholarship or Grant in 2019?""
8. It says, ""Enter the amount you received. Don't include amounts already listed on a W-2 or other tax form."" It already lists $19,633 (=$28,314 – $8,681) under ""Scholarships/Grants/Fellowships listed on 1098-T."" I re-enter the aforementioned $8,681 under ""Employer-Provided Assistance.""

I'm wondering whether I need to include the full amount ($28,314) from Box 5 of my 1098-T when entering the information into TurboTax, especially since $2,100 of that amount was awarded to me for teaching (though this wasn't reported on a W-2 form).

Here is the breakdown of $28,314 from Box 5: 

* $15,257.00 for Scholarships from ss1 
* $4,376.00 for Scholarships (tuition and fees) for Spring 2019
* $4,298.00 for Tuition waivers and exemptions
* $4,383.00 for Tuition waivers and exemptions for Fall 2019

\- How do you 'use' the margin? In other words, when you go to place a buy order for any share I can't see any step where you specify how much you will borrow to meet that trade?

\- Does margin lending simply begin when you start placing buy orders in excess of the cash you hold in your currency account?

Are my parents able to claim me as a qualifying child for the EITC? I looked through the [4 tests](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit/qualifying-child-rules) and meet all of them:

1. Residency - College students are considered to have had the same main home as their parents.
2. Age - I am a full-time student under 24 years old.
3. Joint Return - I am not married and did not file a joint return.
4. Relationship Test - They are my parents.

However, I graduated in May 2019 and have since earned more than my parents in 2019. I also already filed my 2019 taxes as an independent.

My question is, will I be able to file myself as an independent, while being claimed as a qualifying child **(not a dependent)** by my parents specifically for the earned income tax credit? I could not find anything about the *EITC* that talks about my parents needing to provide more than 50% of my support - I only found that for topics on *dependents*.

On the other hand, if my parents could only claim the EITC if I filed as a dependent, wouldn't that no longer be beneficial as I would personally lose the standard deduction and have a much higher tax liability?

fr3hw6,orihime02,"Need Advice, Choosing between two jobs (computer science jobs)","I am a computer science major currently in my last semester. I have two major courses left, a lab, and my graduation project. I really don't want to graduate without having any real world experience, so I was looking for part time work. I applied to two different companies and got accepted into both of them and I'm having a really hard time choosing between them. 

So basically, 

Company A

* job is product validation and testing for microchips. I'd basically be writing tests and emulation to make sure the chips works as intended
* so this was supposed to be a full time job, but because they couldn't find anyone full-time, they changed it to 'can work 70% of the work' which to them is 30-32 hours a week
* closer
* pays $100 more than second job
* so basically i applied to this job because my uncle works there, and he told me about it. Now my uncle is, for the lack of a better word, kind of manipulative, and basically never does anything unless there's something in it for him. Our family dynamic is already kind of bad, anything causes drama, so I'm very uncomfortable with the idea of accepting this job because of this. I would be working in a different branch and not under my uncle, but i don't know if that could change in the future. I was going to set this aside, and not take it into account in my decision, but the minute i got accepted, he told everyone i got accepted and that they 'told me the questions'  (they didn't, they just gave me prep), making him look good and me look bad. I really don't want even more family drama.

Company B

* job is software and web development
* actually part time job, i can work 20 hours a week (which is what i wanted)
* farther
* pays $100 dollars less than first job
* i already know environment is very nice because a lot of my friends work there
* i've always liked this company since forever, always wanted to work there

I really am not sure which to choose. The workload for the first company is going to be very hard with my coursework and graduation project. and since this is my first job, i know for a fact it's probably going to take me more than 30 hours to complete task. also the drama factor has always been very stressful for me and i'm afraid if anything happens, it's just gonna make job worst.

fr2yw0,TaxThrowaway97531,Receiving 1099s from Multiple States,"I'm an entertainer and I performed in different states for the first time in 2019, and have received 1099-Misc forms from 4 states: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota, all around $1500 each, except for one which is $3200. I filed federally on Turbotax (with all the 1099s), but wasn't sure how I should go about doing the state returns, so I saved that for later.  I saw that South Dakota doesn't have an income tax so filing is not required(?), and a couple states had reciprocity with my state, but I wasn't sure if I still needed to file individually with each state.  I went through all of the steps on Turbotax and it said no taxes were owed for any of the states, but still wanted me to pay $50 to file with them.  All but Iowa participates in the combined federal state filing program.

So I guess my question is, do I still have to file with all of these states individually?  Do any of the reciprocity rules/fact that I added the 1099s to my federal return/don't owe any taxes with them prevent me from needing to file?  Do I need to do something specific on turbotax to specify for the combined federal state filing program?  It's probably a dumb question since I can't seem to find too many similar questions, but I just wanted to be sure.",0,1585472371,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fr2yw0/receiving_1099s_from_multiple_states/,personalfinance,1

fr2vxj,loopsy907,I started working on my student and personal debt THIS month after YEARS of ignoring it. (Mental Health) WARNING: Long read.,"I have struggled with mental health my whole life and managed to let it wreck my financials. In Fall 2018 I made a change in mental health providers. I begun a regular schedule with a therapist and was taken from *seven* daily mental health prescriptions to **one**. 

After a year off of all those (maximum allowed dosage) medications -which had kept me basically a zombie... I slowly became more “aware” of things I’d have disassociated myself from... for YEARS. 

I’m a pizza delivery driver now. I got this job on a whim shortly after changing therapists and meds last year. I went from PT to FT slowly over the last year as my need to not sleep 16+ hours at a time faded away. 

My income seems so uncertain right now. I have no clue about unemployment or how mine would be figured. 

I’ve heard about the stimulus checks. I’ll qualify for one check at $1,200. I plan on investing this into my car (repairs and maintainer) as it’s key to my continued income. 

I make different hourly wages based upon what role I’m fulfilling at that moment. Then come other factors: Tips. Gas reimbursements. 

My income budget has(had) become a thing of beauty. I have studied what I’m making down to a science. 

For instance, when I’m dispatched on delivery I know I make 8¢ a min, 99¢ every 3 miles plus that trips tip (if I get one). 

Say I’m in the store cutting pizza or washing dishes? 16¢ a minute. 

Why by the minute? Because when clocked in for the shift as a driver you get paid a fluctuating hourly rate based on inside/outside of store- $10/h inside, $5/h on delivery. 33¢ per mile to reimburse gas/mileage/vehicle maintenance. So, to sum this up I want to be as fast as possible to get mor deliveries per shift. I want to be accurate, safe and efficient because time is money. 

*I am the Deliverator.* I am a beast- Safest driver...Most deliveries per hour. Highest mileage at the end of the night. 

I’m all about accuracy and efficiency. I always read my ticket. NOTHING is ever forgotten. I always have their drinks, sides and even the side sauces those poor customers have to pay 60¢ a piece for. That cheese and peppers your driver never has? I **ALWAYS** have it. 8 packs each neatly tucked into a clear bag, sealed with company sticker displaying hours. 

I calculate every turn based on which will pop green first- the turn arrow or light.. Ever had to be a pizza driver? You’ll get this. Anyone else probably thinks I’m a psycho. 

I don’t push speed limits and don’t do crazy stuff. Once upon a time I was a school bus driver. For years. The safety culture was beat into me. 

I THRIVE in this routine. Non-debt related Bills? Paid. 
Now I want to establish a foundation. Maybe owning a home. I’m 35, never owned property. Besides the car. It was a lucky buy at an auction for less than $1.5k cash. She’s racked up over 20,000 miles this last year.  She’s now over 212k miles. (Mid-2000’s Hyundai Santa Fe). 

Ok, so all of that is what’s keeping my mental health in check. The routine. The grind. The dependable income. 

I don’t wanna be a millionaire or anything. I just want enough to know that basic needs are NEVER at risk, that my kids ALWAYS have what they need and even sometimes the things they want. 

My estimated income for 2020 (well at least it was what I had estimated before COVID19) is around $17k after tax in hourly wage and claimed tips and around $5k in untaxed mileage/maintenance reimbursement. Add to that I have a kid on the spectrum so that’s about $8k a year to help support her needs from untaxed SSI. 

I owe student loans around $7k. They are in default. I think. I was in (pre?)rehabilitation process as of last week and even made my first minimum payment. But there was to be some official documentation either fedx’d or  e-signing or something.

My student loan owner now has a crazy long automated message when I dial the number. The site is under maintenance. I only was able to understand any of this at all with using credit karma and it’s resources. Now their site is down too. 

I also decided last week would be a great time to contact a half dozen personal debt consolidators to see what they would say vs each other and now have myself confused on who to chose. 

My personal debt consists of default credit cards (3) totaling around $4k and a totally bogus damage claim from a landlord from 6 years ago of around $1k. (This is honesty hour here guys, telling it all for sake of best advise- I left that apartment beautiful and squeaky clean.) But I have no proof of that. So I guess I have to eat the bill. (Lesson learned on documenting move out, I had taken photos but lost them). 

Ok so **my question is:** *Do I sign anything right now when they do contact me or do I wait this economic crisis thing out?* How would you tackle your debt and budget if these were your circumstances?

It was brought to my attention that the personal debt might fade away cause most of it happened in 2014 and 2015. The 7 year thing? Honestly I don’t get how that works. The bottom line is I used the money. I signed the agreements. I’d like to settle my responsibilities. 

Sorry for the meandering (probably tmi) ramble. My brain works differently than most people and it’s hard for me to understand what to do without help and having things broken up for me. I also have an obsessive need to feel understood. 

Thanks for making it to this point. You’re awesome.",4,1585471872,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fr2vxj/i_started_working_on_my_student_and_personal_debt/,personalfinance,1

fr2obm,throwaway193910,How can I send money from a US to Canadian account without going to a physical bank?,"Hi there,

I am a US and Canadian dual citizen who goes to university in Canada but lives in the United States. When the coronavirus situation started and all my classes moved online, I went back home to the US with the intention of returning in a couple of months for final exams and taking summer semester courses . However, as of now, the university has closed and all summer courses will also be online; in addition US to CA nonessential travel has been banned, so I can no longer cross the border. The issue is that I signed a year long lease for my apartment; I do not have enough money in my Canadian bank account to pay rent in a few months, because I didn't think I would have to stay in the US so long and had intended to deposit another check when I went back.

I have a USD account with Bank of Montreal in Canada, which I use deposit checks from my US bank accounts; I can then move money from that account to a regular CAD checking account using BMO's exchange rate. However, I cannot deposit checks into the USD account using online banking; the only way is for me to deposit a physical check to the bank while I'm there. In addition, I also have a Capital One 360 checking account that has no foreign exchange fee. I sometimes move money by withdrawing cash at a Canadian ATM using my card then depositing the money back into my account at a BMO ATM. In theory, I can move thousands of dollars in this way by paying only a small ATM fee. 

I've tried depositing a USD check into my BMO checking account using the BMO online banking app, but it states that only CAD checks can be deposited. In addition, I'm not sure I am even able to deposit any check using the BMO app while I'm in the US since the app is from the Canadian app store. I've also looked at Xoom by paypal, but I've read that it charges tremendous fees; I am also unable to bypass the currency exchange by withdrawing CAD directly from my Capital One account using Xoom, since USD, GBP, and EUR are the only currencies I can withdraw. 

At the moment, I can't think of anything else that I can do. The best case scenario would be if the border reopens before the first rent payment that I do not have money for is due, but even then I would have to make a several hour trip just to deposit a check. Does anyone have advice as to what I should do?

fr2bp4,ProperAioli,Eligibility for the $1200 CARES Act tax rebate is only tentatively based on 2018 or 2019 AGI,"Eligibility for the tax rebate is based on your 2020 income, but since that number isn't known yet, the IRS is tentatively determining eligibility for the rebate and the amount you receive based on your last tax filing, so 2019 if you have already filed, or 2018 if you haven't filed your 2019 return yet.

If you do not qualify based on your 2018/2019 return, but you do qualify based on 2020 income, you will get a rebate, but unfortunately not until you file your 2020 return. Something the CARES Act does not specify is what happens if you are eligible based on your 2018/2019 return, but if in 2020 you are eligible for less or not eligible at all.

This might sound like you'll get to keep the money, but there is also a chance further legislation will be written to cover this omission. So consider saving the money and earning what little interest you can, or at least be prepared to pay the amount back come April 2021.

Any financial suggestions/advice will be appreciated.,"I'm a recent graduate and had been struggling to find a job after graduation. I finally started a temp job last month in the field that I wanted to pursue. Everything was going great until about a week ago when my state went on lockdown and I was told to stay home and not work until further notice. My company was generous enough to give 75% of wages to employees without work but since I am not a regular employee I was told that I am not eligible to receive it. In addition, I am not eligible for unemployment benefits as I wasn't technically fired and don't have enough work history at the company because I just started. My mom also files her taxes early so she claimed me as a dependent for her 2019 taxes, which would disqualify me from receiving the $1,200 stimulus check (to my understanding: individual taxpayers get the full $1,200 if under $75,000 income and dependents under age 17 get $500 and dependents age 17 and over get nothing). I live away from my parents and only have about $4k in savings and I don't know how long this whole situation will last. I also would prefer not to ask them for financial help because they aren't doing financially well either. I was really hoping that the stimulus check would help my current situation but I just found out that I am not even eligible for that and now I'm just sitting here depressed and frustrated.

fr0ojk,HealthInsTemp,"Mom getting surgery, no insurance. How can I help her?","Mods please delete is this isnt allowed.

TL;DR: My mom went to ER tonight and will have gall bladder surgery tomorrow. She is 63 with no insurance. Lives in Minnesota. What options are there to help her?

Long version below

My sister (lets call her “L”) called me tonight saying she was bringing my mom to the ER because she was in serious pain. My mom is stubborn as all hell so her agreeing to go meant she was in real pain.

Mom was put on IV and pain meds by ER doc. Hd a CAT scan performed and ultrasound in area. Gall bladder full of gall stones and has pancreatitis. Guess gall bladder was full of stones. She is staying the night tonight, and will have surgery tomorrow. Possibly staying tomorrow night as well.

My mom works two jobs. She is a nurse at the elementary school and also works as a nurse at an old folks home. Works all the time but cant afford insurance. I was shocked when L told me. I have doubts that my mom even tried to find affordable options through MNsure. Im also very sad that someone cant afford insurance working two jobs.

Ive never had to deal with a surgery without insurance so I have no idea where to begin. I feel like my mom will be taken advantage of by billing and will sign whatever is put in front of her. I apologize of these questions are stupid, but I am very much out of my element. 

My questions is what can be done to help her? 
Are there options for assistance?
Is it too late to find coverage?
Where should I start to get this process rolling?
Can I somehow use my insurance to help her out?

I have around $52,000 saved up in a credit union that I can use. I cant contact hospital billing until Monday. Hoping someone here can point me in the right direction or knows where to find information.

fr0mxo,LumpGarden,"If you were in my situation, would you ask you ask your boss to let you leave?","I live in the US in Oregon, and I work for a company that's impacted by current events, and I'm wondering if it'd be smarter to ask your boss to let you leave in this situation?

Due to the ongoing situation, we're very short on work at my job. There were a lot of people who were told to leave the last few days, and the work environment is very depressing. Even if things get better, I estimate we'll have about two to three more weeks of work if we're lucky. The boss works remotely and occasionally checks in, and though I've tried to ask for additional projects to work on, she always says no.

I was planning on finding a better job before the virus came, and now almost no one but much lower job positions are hiring. I feel depressed,  and more so after I found out that I actually might be making more money if I was laid off through unemployment (I dont even make $600 a week). 

I think the main thing for most people, is that by not being laid off, they're getting the comfort of job security, and I dont have more than 2-3 weeks of that. I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time doing busy work that could be spent on my job hunt, and the work environment is very depressing.

I know that I cant make up work, and Im wondering if it's a bad idea to just be straightforward and ask my boss to let me leave? In the event unemployment gets reduced, I have a 6 month's emergency savings fund, but I was really hoping I wouldn't have to tap into so I could use it to go to college some day.

1. Is it better to stay for now, so I'm more attractive to jobs by being able to click the ""currently employed"" box?

2. Or given how I'd have more time to find a job if I was gone, and possibly more money, should I ask my boss to let me leave?

3. I was told to avoid immediately finding odd jobs like working at a gas station, to spend more time looking for a good job. I've heard taking a lower job would look bad on my resume, and Id be burned out if I'm looking for a better job while I'm working one I hate.

So looking to downsize. Found a nice house for 315k. Can put 20% down and clear every penny of debt. Would cut my mortgage payments in half, and would no longer have 800 a month in debt repayment.

But banks are telling me that I can't afford it.... What in the fuck? My credit took a hit in those couple years, but I mean I haven't missed a payment, and will have 1600 a month less in payments... So how can I not afford it?
It's so frustrating. I can't find a cosigner.

So I'm stuck struggling, almost drowning, it's tiresome. So very tiresome.

So how do I get to a better place with what seems like the universe acting against us?

I've thought about renting, but with two kids a dog and two cats, staying in a decent school in a decent area I really don't save anything. Really not worth saving 200$ a month and losing the 800+ equity a month, and I mean prices can only go up from now, right?

We've already cut nearly everything from life.

Do I file for bankruptcy? Would put moving out of the option for a few years for sure, but maybe it'll bring relief in monthly payments?

I am currently finishing up my semester of school and am unemployed because of COVID19 (but am living w/ my parents and not financially at risk)  but have a job offer for a position that would start in June. It pays $35k a year ($2300 take home/month) and I have $1500 a month in expenses (when living independently of my parents). 

This position also has tuition assistance, which would contribute $5250 a year to my schooling.

If i do part time, the $5250 would most of my expenses and I won't have to take out any more loans. If I go full time, there will be roughly $7k that my company won't cover that I would have to at least have to partially cover with student loans. 

My degree is in Economics with a minor in business admin, so it's not insanely good money or anything, but even if I took this additional $7k I would graduate with less than $12k in loans for my whole degree (i took college classes in high school, did clep exams, etc).

fqzjik,starrdev5,Devising strategy to support local restaurants- are franchise owned restaurants like McDonald’s and chili’s going to be alright?,"So I was able to rearrange my budget so that I can almost triple what I spend every month on eating out by cutting down on other expenses that I mostly can’t do anyway with the quarantine. I was able to map out all the local restaurants in my tax district which is 14 if not including chains like chic-Fil-A, McDonald’s and chili’s but is 32 if including them. I’d love to support every single one but with 32 I simply can’t eating 3 meals a day. I know that a lot of chain restaurants are actually franchises that is bought into and owned by one guy who can lose everything if that goes under, but my question is do you think that those owners can receive assistance from corporate and will make it through alright? If so then as much as it pains me I can cut out the chain restaurants and focus on supporting the 14 local owned restaurants, which is much more manageable. I’m sure it might change company to company but I’d appreciate your feedback on any of them. There mostly the fast food ones Bk, Wendy’s, McDonald’s, chic fil-a, dominos etc. and some larger ones like Chilis, and Applebee’s.

For reference, I live in southwest Florida. I am 24. I am an immigrant to the United States. My single mother brought me and my sister, seven years my junior, here 15 years ago. When we did move to Florida (mom married an American, they have since divorced), we came with a suitcase each and less than $2,000, nothing else. I moved out of the house at 18 years old and I have supported myself while going to school, on and off - switching majors and taking a lot of time off to figure out my path. These days, I work as a waiter and I am two semesters away from a software engineering degree (bachelor's). 

I live with my girlfriend and a very good friend. Of course, it is nice to have my friend live with us and it saves us some money. But we can do just fine without him contributing to rent and we did so for the first year in this house.

Basically, what I am getting at is, I feel like I started off with a relatively shitty hand yet I am still able to live very comfortably with a menial job that requires hardly any skill. My girl and I make about 35-40k each. We are still able to go to school and spend time with the people we love and doing the things that we love. Last year, we traveled through Europe for 28 without even needing to be frugal. 

Nothing was given to me from my parents. I have had no incredible scholarships. My area is not a hot spot of incredible job opportunity. I work at a nicer restaurant in the area, and it is not even the best one. 

Yet, I have 6 months liquid savings, I contribute 400 a month to my Roth IRA, I am able to save for vacations. I can't buy whatever I want, but I am very comfortable.

Why does it seem that so many people can't get out of the cycle, that capitalism is standing on their throat, that everyone is broke and struggling? Am I just lucky? Am I ignorant to people's struggles?

I am genuinely curious and not trying to shit on anyone's problems.

fqylw0,Birdbilly,Would greatly appreciate advice on where to begin after failing to file taxes long term,"Throwaway because I really need advice for an epic fuck up that I want address it asap. And I'm super anxious about it. 

I'm a US citizen. I have not filed Federal or State taxes for many years, probably since 2004, for reasons I won't get detailed about (a couple of hospitalizations for mental reasons, for which I didn't have insurance, and a bankruptcy, and then having to climb out of a deep emotional/financial hole and find employment after a big outage/resume gap). I have been mostly consistently employed since about 2007 though, and have had taxes and social security withheld every year. So I haven’t filed but I’ve paid federal taxes and SS through payroll deductions.

I need to start cleaning up this mess and would sure appreciate input on how to proceed. 

I have W2s for every year. However I had two periods of unemployment (about 1 year in 2004 and about 3 months in 2018) for which I have no documentation. I also cashed out an 401K in 2018 for which I might owe taxes. I’m 64 so there was no age penalty. I expect to work until around 70 if that’s relevant. I’m employed now. And since I work in IT I’ve made a decent income during this time span. (Retirement is another subject; let’s not go there now.)

That’s just for federal taxes. I’ve lived in many states so I likely owe some state taxes too. 

And while I have all W2s (aside from unemployment periods) I don’t have documentation for banks, 1099s and such. I’ve really only had checking accounts and some 401K though, not high interest accounts.

Anyway, I’m obviously terrible with financial shit and pretty overwrought about this, so I don’t expect to get this  resolved alone. I will need to hire some kind of tax professional; I don’t know if they should be a CPA, EA, tax attorney, other? Would the IRS itself be helpful? 

Advice would be great on where to start and what type of professional to hire. Thanks very much.",12,1585450997,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqylw0/would_greatly_appreciate_advice_on_where_to_begin/,personalfinance,1

fqxvts,maverick082011,Sister in- law has been committing bank fraud on my mom.,"I will try to keep this straight forward and to the point. I promise this is related to finance.

So my brother and his wife had been committing bank fraud on my mom, dad, and grandma. 

I have suspected this since 2017, as a result, this has lead to a toxic relation ship with my brother seeing that at the time I had control of my mother’s finances and caught on quickly to what was happening. She live on a fixed income that come from Social Security Disability and Medical/Medicaid. She insisted on not doing any thing at the time, she couldn’t stand the idea of reporting it. However, each time the bank looked into it, they would refund her the money. 

My mom passed in July of 2019, as a result it has taken me awhile to filter through her belongings. Today I had the opportunity to go through her paper work and I was reminded just how fucked up what my brother and his wife had done. My mom had a file and documented, in detail, the fraud that had taken place. 

Between now, and the time that mother had passed, my dad and my grandma had become aware of the bank fraud on their accounts. 

I believe I would like to report my brother and his wife but have a few questions:

Who or where would I report them? 

Would I be in the wrong for reporting then? 

Can I do it anonymously? 

What would the their consequences be?

My brother seemingly was completely unaware, is there a way to just report his wife? 

The bank performed “Investigations” but the results were inconclusive?! 

I hope this all makes sense, and I hope I posted in the correct thread.",3,1585448127,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqxvts/sister_in_law_has_been_committing_bank_fraud_on/,personalfinance,1

- CD 1: Expires 7/10/2020 APY 2.30%

Potential New CD 1: Marcus by Goldman Sachs. Expires 10/28/2020 APY 1.70%
Potential New CD 2: Ally Bank. Expires 2/28/2021 APY 1.55%

Trying to figure out which is the better play. The federal reserve already dropped rates to near 0%. Banks are going to drop their rates very soon too, probably on Monday.

Despite the potential CDs paying less than I'm getting right now, I can lock in the rate for more time. The alternative would be that I let my CDs expire naturally and then they earn near nothing afterwards.

(No-Penalty CD means I can close these accounts at any time between now and maturity date for free and no penalty).

I didn't want to trade in and do a personal sale on my car to maximize cash. The thing was, I had to order a duplicate title for it since I never got one when I paid it off years ago. This was well over a month ago when I went to the DMV in Illinois to do it. Spring forward to Coronavirus pandemic and I still haven't gotten my title. Now I'm panicking that I won't be able to sell it anytime soon. I am not hurting for money but it sitting there is gonna suck. 

I had a plan. Basically my wife has a 2009 Scion xD with 100,000+ miles. I have a 2012 Buick Regal with 98,000 miles that has gotten a engine replaced and has gotten extremely banged up and I've given up repairing it. I picked up a 2004 Nissan Altima with 150,000 miles for basically free that I am learning on and we have a new Subaru Forester (we plan on keeping this for 10+ years.) My plan was to sell the Buick Regal privately because I don't want it anymore. Once I got confident with the Altima, I would sell the XD and we'd be back to two cars. I got 4 cars right now. I might just jump ahead and sell the XD and hold onto the Buick just to get some traction, once I get the title and I feel confident with the Altima, I'll sell the Buick. I was also thinking about doing one of those sell your cars services but I know they lowball and I'm not desperate.

**Current situation**

* Mid 30s, making a bit over 100,000 a year
* $12,000 in 401k from previous job
* $25,000 in Roth IRA
* No standard IRA
* 50k in high yield savings
* Another 50k in high risk investments

I tend to use my Roth for trading and buy + hold in my regular accounts for tax reasons. My first idea was to move the 401k to the roth (backdoor) and use some of it to trade futures (somewhat experienced trader, want to make some tax free money off this volatility). But when I enabled futures they (etrade) did it as a separate account. Apparently you can't move money between the two roth accounts, so when I'm done trading futures the money would just sit there.

I think I need a standard IRA at some point to optimize withdrawal taxes in retirement. Do I just forget the futures idea and use the 401k to start that? Would a different broker let me trade futures with a single Roth?

fqwrm7,Imayno2,Tax return filed and refund was garnished for student loan default and wouldn’t have been if I hadn’t filed early.,"I’m eligible for the stimulus payment of $1200, which is an astonishing change in fortune for me at this point in my life. But it seems to me that if I’d waited to file my taxes, I would have received the ~$1200 that was garnished because I’ve defaulted on my student loans. According g to the NYT, “In fact, the bill temporarily suspends nearly all efforts to garnish tax refunds to repay debts, including those to the I.R.S. itself.”

Is there any way to get that money back or am I out of luck because I filed early? And if there is a way to get it back, can someone direct me to the right area for more information about what to do. 

Second question: how do I start the process of not being in default with my student loans? It makes me feel like an idiot to ask this, but I have no idea where to start. I don’t get snail mail about it. I don’t have access to my school email anymore, and I don’t receive anything in my active email accounts. I occasionally get phone calls, but they don’t sound legit. 

I’ve been completely taken in by one of those, “we’ll help you straighten out your finances by a aging the payments when you send your money to us directly...”

fqw9pk,jesusthecarpenta,I did some serious work on my debt with my tax return. Do I have any chance of bringing my credit score to a house-buying level in the time-frame I'm hoping for?,"We put the vast majority of our tax return into paying off debt.  Our apartment lease is up in July, and if it is at all possible to get into a home at that time we want to.  However, I have a super shitty credit score.

Right now I have a 540.  It is embarrassing.  I let a credit card go unpaid for 7 months and missed a few payments here and there on my other cards.  I also had several medical bills go into collections over the past two years.  Before paying things off, I was at 105% utilization on my cards.

With my wife and I's tax return, we brought one of my cards down from $500 to $200, another from $1200 to $900, and completely paid off the card that went seven months unpaid (the day it was scheduled to be sold to collections, I got really lucky.)

I also paid off every delinquency that Credit Karma listed as High Impact.  It was three total, and on one I was able to get confirmation that they would remove it from my credit report.  The other two will not be removed, but the collections company will report that they are paid off (I settled on these two, was that a bad idea?)

I still have a few other medical delinquencies but they are several years old and as I understand not worth paying off.

We paid off money that I owed my old college and got caught up on our cell-phone bill so that we can start receiving my wife's employee discount with the rest, which does not directly affect my credit score but does free up another couple hundred dollars a month to put towards my cards till July if it helps.

With all this in mind, is there any possibility of my score jumping the 100 points I need for a 640 by July?  I will continue to have on-time payments until then and am not touching my cards, nor am I applying for any lines of credit.  I understand that this is a complex question and if it cannot be answered it's okay, but my wife and I are very lost and very much need to get out of this apartment.

fqw5vl,tayezz,Paypal Transfer Reversal,"I recently sold my computer to someone and was paid via PayPal and Venmo across three separate transactions. The buyer sent me me $200 from his Venmo account, $550 from his PayPal account, and $350 from his sister's PayPal account. I listed the computer for sale on Facebook Marketplace, not PayPal, and directly handed the item to the buyer's friend whom I met and had sign a bill of sale. I just received an email from PayPal notifying me of case opened against me by his sister for $360.45 (why the extra $10.45? Foreign transaction?). 

Before I ever met to give him the computer, I was paid in full, and I called PayPal and mentioned to them explicitly what I was planning to do and asked if there was anyway if the transfers could be reversed. I had reserved a healthy sense of skepticism just because the payment logistics were a bit unconventional. I was ASSURED that because the item wasn't sold through PayPal, and the payments were essentially just private money transfers between two individual parties, that neither party could dispute or challenge the transactions. Now, this. 

I drove to meet his friend for the handoff. I have screenshots of my conversation with the buyer via Facebook Messenger (which he now blocked me on) and iMessage (which is no longer accepting messages and goes straight to voicemail when called). What can I do? My PayPal balance is now in the negative for the disputed amount.

Two weeks ago pretty much all lenders pulled out of the space save for a handful.  Our company went from 7 programs down to 2, and stopped lending in several states.  We also increase rates by almost 1.5% and increased the minimum down by 10%.  I had over ten loans in my pipeline that all had to be cancelled as such.

A few days later our company announced all sales people would go from a base pay, plus bonus and commission structure to strictly commission.  Since it takes roughly 2 months to close a loan in our space, another month to be paid commissions I am now looking at June as the soonest for my next paycheck.  That is a big of because rates and requirements have increased drastically while our programs and states they are available in has shrunk by a lot.

At this point I have applied for unemployment, but I am worried I won’t qualify since I am technically still employed?  Our employer sent out new company agreements changing the base/commission/bonus pay to commission only.  I refused to sign it.  If I don’t do they have grounds to let me go and then I can collect unemployment no problem?  I also had nearly 92 PTO hours I assume they would need to pay me on unless I sign the new company plan?

* 401k current employer: \~6k (1 year, no match)
* Emergency fund: 30k in 2% savings account (6 months)
* Stocks &amp; ETFs: 12k
* HSA: 3k
* Mortgage Equity: 25k down payment after closing costs
* Checking account: \~5k

Assets:

* Car: 10k, paid off
* House: 385k @ 30 years (\~2650/month)

Monthly saving:

* Paycheck: $1500
* 401k: 6% (50% match up to 5%)
* Checking: Whatever I don't use each month eventually rolls over into stocks/ETFs/savings

The house is located in Hanover, MD near NSA, DC and an army military base.

We've already been approved but are having doubts due to the uncertainty of the market. With the development we will be locked at that price and we are scared the market will tank (unlikely? Who knows?). We spoke with our mortage broker and he isn't concerned with new construction but if it did the house wouldn't appraises and we wouldn't get approved for the loan amount

The boss works remotely and infrequently checks in, and though I've tried to ask for additional projects to work on, she always says no. I have a little bit of job security just because the only other person who does what I do is going on maternity leave soon, but it may not be enough.

It's hard to feel constantly on edge, and spending a lot of time I could be using to apply for jobs, doing menial tasks. Soon there will be no work, and I'll likely need to talk to the boss, and I'm scared. I have a 7 month's emergency savings fund that I was hoping I wouldn't have to tap into so I could use it to go to college some day.

1. I'm full-time, and if they reduce my schedule in any way, can I recieve benefits?

2. How much can my schedule be reduced before I'd be making more money through benefits if I was just fully told to go? 

3. Ive was told to avoid immediately finding odd jobs like gas station attendant or grocery bagger, and spend more time looking for a good job if possible. They said taking a lower job would look bad on my resume, and though gaps aren't good, Id be more burned out if I'm looking for a better job while I'm working one I hate.

How much time should I give myself before I take a lower job?",5,1585439265,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqvi0a/would_it_make_more_financial_sense_to_ask_my_boss/,personalfinance,0
fqvgwe,2legit2quitthrowaway,Should we pay off this old delinquent credit card?,"My wife and I opened a credit card several years ago. I was an authorized user on the card, but it is only in my wife's name I believe. For reasons, we fell behind on payments, and eventually stopped paying entirely. It's been about 6 years, and my understanding is that it will fall off of my wife's credit after 7 years of no payments- that date should be july 2021. The balance is \~$6000, I'm pretty sure the debt has been sold to a different creditor/collector than the original bank, and I'm pretty sure the new creditor would settle for \~$3000.

We would like to purchase a new home summer 2021. We are considering either selling our current home, or refinancing to a lower rate (currently 5.675%) and keeping it as a rental property. Not sure if any of that is relevant or not, but wanted to include it just in case.

My question is this- should we pay it off in full, try to settle at a lower amount, or just wait and let it fall off her credit next year? I imagine there are arguments for each decision, and possibly some other options I haven't considered. I've tried to research as much as I can on it, but I can't seem to find a recommended course of action, if one exists.

fquq74,truffleshufflegoon,Seeking opinions on refinancing our current home with the goal of purchasing an (additional) income property.,"Our single family home was purchased in 2008, mortgage was $150k total. When my husband and I got married we started paying an additional $150-300 per month towards the principal and currently have $121k left at 5.5%. Similar homes in our neighborhood are selling for $175-200k.


Considering the historically low rates, we are able to refinance through our local credit union at 3.5% for 30 years, 3.375% for 20 years, or 2.75% for 15 years.


We have two car loans totaling $39k at interest rates between 2-4%. $5k in credit card debt, which will be paid off over the next couple months.


Current gross income for both of us is $110k per year.


Our next financial goal is to purchase a multi-family home with the idea of renting out the units to cover the mortgage of that property and our own. We aren't looking to get rich off income property, just put ourselves in a better position in the long run. Ideally it would be a three family.


Anyway, my opinion is we should refinance the full value of the house, take the lump sum from equity and put it in a high yield savings account to have on hand for a down payment when we find the right property. Our taxes and insurance are roughly $300/mo. For an (estimated) 180k mortgage, it breaks down as:

* 30 year, monthly payment $808, total w/ interest $290,981 (only minimum paid, no additional principal)
* 20 year, monthly payment $1,032, total $247,777
* 15 year, monthly payment $1,222, total $219,873


I hate to potentially pay more in interest, but I lean towards the 20 year. My reasoning behind this is during ""good"" months when we have the units leased, we can cover the minimum payments of both mortgages, in addition to applying more towards the principal of each every month. During ""bad"" months, when units are vacant or costly repairs arise, we would have a bit less overhead.


Would this make sense? Or is there a better way to go about things? Thank you in advance.",1,1585436594,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fquq74/seeking_opinions_on_refinancing_our_current_home/,personalfinance,1

fquery,beardedcoug08,Reduce your expenses! 24 hour fitness removed online option to freeze/cancel memberships.,"My monthly 24 hour fitness gym membership is $50 and though I haven’t been effected by a lay-off (hopefully won’t), I think now is a great time to really focus on reducing unnecessary expenses. 

For those that weren’t aware, 24 hour fitness removed the option to cancel/freeze gym memberships, and on top of that the customer service phone number is an automated voice message system with no option to speak to a representitive. 

My experience with ClassPass was a whole different story. I was billed ~$45 4 days before the gym closure rule went into effect. ClassPass ended up freezing my account automatically when the rule went into effect. A few days after that, I wanted to see about getting my credits refunded that I had just received. I sent an email to their customer support team and I received a response in less than 12 hours stating they issued a refund. I 100% recommend ClassPass after this whole situation and will likely go to a more expensive plan. 

In the end I ended up just cancelling my debit card to get a replacement card so 24 can’t pull funds from my account. I’m upset I had to go to this extreme length, but with so much uncertainty right now I thought it was the best decision. 

I’ll be cancelling my 24 membership once the quarantine is over, and it’s also perfect timing since my annual fee was about to renew in April. 

TL/DR: 24 hour fitness is a greedy corporation that puts profits before people. ClassPass on the other hand has impeccable customer service.",6,1585435514,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fquery/reduce_your_expenses_24_hour_fitness_removed/,personalfinance,1

fqtzy7,SleepyUnicornMom,Mortgage DTI Ratio,"Hi,

We hope to buy a home later this year. We have to get our debt to income ratio down. We’ll get approved for down payment assistance 5% of purchase price  of up to 15K however they advised out DTI has to come down. Would it make more sense to 

Pay the smaller cc balances down to zero to get rid of all the $25 minimum payments that show up on credit report? I unfortunately have like 5 CC with about $50 balances to $400 balances. 

OR the higher interest cards? A few of the CC have high interests. 

OR we have 3 credit cards that have $4000 , $4500, $2400 with minimum payments of around $100 each. 

If I pay towards the high balance credit cards I won’t be able to pay them in full so I’ll still have all those minimum payments considered in my DTI. 

We have about $15K-20K but I’d like to keep a good amount as a cushion so not wanting to pay off all the debt. I know a lot of people are going to say pay your debt etc but I’m not going to do that now. It took many years to save and we’re at a point where renting is extremely expensive compared to buying.

It's a $7,500, interest free, 2nd mortgage, that I somehow got the impression that I wouldn't have to ever pay back as long as I stayed in the house for at least 5 years. I later found out that I was confusing that with another similar program I read about called ""good neighbor next door"", where you have to buy a shitty house in a shitty neighborhood.  So, I found out that if I ever sell or refinance my house, i will have to repay the $7,500.

I was also under the impression that after i had 20% equity in my home, I would no longer have to pay for mortgage insurance. I later found out that doesn't matter with FHA loans, and I will have to pay MIP for the life of the loan. I also read something on a website about this where they were talking about how you have to pay 2 mortgage insurance premiums for FHA loans. One that is rolled into the loan, and one that is monthly. 

""Borrowers who use an FHA-insured home loan to buy a house are required to pay:

  -  an upfront mortgage insurance premium (MIP) that’s 1.75% of the base loan amount, and
  -  an annual MIP that’s usually* 0.7% for a 15-year loan, or 0.85% for a 30-year loan.""

So, if i did refinance, would i get that 1.75% taken off the payoff amount ?

The payment includes amounts that go into an escrow account for property taxes, home owners insurance, and MIP. I know the property taxes have gone up some over the last 7 years, and the MIP has gone down a little bit, but my loan info is showing it at about $75/mo for the last few months.

My home owners insurance was $666 for 2019. I saw that it was $712 for 2020, so it's going up every year.

My monthly payment started out around $550/mo and has gone up every year and just went up again from $626 to $657/mo.  I realize that part of the reason for the increase is because of home owners insurance increases and property taxes. 

It is a 30 year FHA loan.

My initial loan amount was $88,500

My effective interest rate is 2.875%

My current principal is $73.995

I'm wondering if it would be worth the effort to try to refinance to keep from paying the mortgage insurance since I'm almost at 20% equity. 

I realize that I could possibly shop around for different home owners insurance to see if I could save some money there too, but I'm really wondering about the mortgage insurance stuff and if I can get out of paying that.

I also know that I would have to repay the $7,500 if I refinance.

Would it save me money in the long run to refinance if I could get a decent rate? (I have an excellent credit score)

What rate would I need to get to make it worth it?

fqtpiv,vio789sssss,New Adult Still Learning,"Hi all,

I’m getting ready to start my first adult job pretty quick and wanted to ask a few questions. I have totally graduated from college but with everything going down I found a place that would hire me ahead of time. They are completely reputable and I know at least a little about them.   


Theoretically my starting salary is going to be $38,000. I did the math to be roughly $700 a week pre-tax. I am 21, male, with no dependents. How much should I expect taxed and could someone help me understand the tax brackets better?

&amp;#x200B;

Next, I’m planning on living with a roommate and we found a place for about $850 a month. If I’m doing my math correctly that will correlate to around 35-40% of my income going towards housing. Is that too much?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I know that a general rule of thumb is to have 6 months of expenses saved in an emergency fund in case of well....emergency. Would it be worth it to save a little more for peace of mind? I ask because I would like to start investing for the future and I figure it’ll take me around 4-5 months to have that kind of emergency fund.

&amp;#x200B;

My son is 6 months old and I make enough money with my salary to provide for all that we need currently so I’d like to put the money to work over the next 5 years at least. 

What is the best thing I can do, considering the current situation of the economy, to see a safe return on the money? 

My current plan of thinking is to buy stock in large companies, with hefty amounts of cash-on-hand, that are currently down 20-30% over the past month. 

Other thoughts were to buy up real estate at tax sales. I’m not sure how it works in other places, but in my county if someone is behind on their property taxes then the county will put a FiFa on the parcel and after while they auction it off for the word taxes. The winner pays cash on site but can’t touch the property for 12 months. The owner has that 12 months to pay you back + 20%. After 12 months you can foreclose on the property and tax possession. It’s really a win win because the taxes owed are typically $2-3k range for $200k+  valued properties.

Any advice, suggestions, or concerns?

fqslla,BimblesMcPippens,Someone else is using my SSN and nobody has been able to help,"I have spent countless hours attempting to resolve this issue over the past 5 years. I have been to my local SSA Office and called the head DC Branch with no luck, in fact I was told I'm pretty much screwed, while laughing at me, by the individual I was speaking with at the DC Office. I am an identical twin and have a consecutively issued SSN to my twin. when I run a credit check on myself using my information I always get my report back, with my info. When someone else runs it, 50/50 it will come back with my number and a different persons name. 

Legally, I am not allowed to have a copy of that report, which I have been informed is what I need to take to the SSA Office to dispute or resolve my problem. On one occasion I was kindly provided the name of the individual and was able to google them, I have since lost this info when my old computers HDD died. It would appear that this person has a home, boat, two cars, etc., all using my SSN. I am currently in the process of attempting to apply for unemployment and both the state and federal SSA databases are reporting that my surname differ on the database. 

I have attempted to open bank accounts at several banks and told that someone already has an account using my social and denied any additional information and most recently the hospital where I was also informed that someone was also using my SSN. In the past, I have frozen all three lines of credit and signed up with a major credit reporting company to monitor my identity but that seems to have done absolutely nothing, my guess is because this person is using their personal info and my SSN. 

I am at a loss for what to do at this point. :( would applying for a new SSN work and what info would I require to validate my reason for applying for a new SSN, I believe I was told that I would need a copy of this other persons info - which is something I simply haven't been able to obtain :/ Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",11,1585429684,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqslla/someone_else_is_using_my_ssn_and_nobody_has_been/,personalfinance,1

So I’m looking to buy a duplex with 3 bedrooms per unit and a detached garage with a loft.  The garage+loft is spacious enough that it could be retrofitted with a kitchen and bathroom and be rented out.  My question is, could I do all this work and then live in it myself and still depreciate the added kitchen/bathroom.  Otherwise I’d be missing out on additional rent I could get from renting out 3 bedrooms as I’d live by myself in the 3 bed unit.

If the answer to that question is no... could I live in the 3 bedroom for 1-2 years while I retrofit the garage and rent it out, depreciate the kitchen and bathroom then decide to move into the garage once that renter moves out?  Or would I have to stop depreciating once I stopped renting the garage out?

fqrny6,BrokeandBougee,Using Cash to Negotiating debt repayment.,"Please forgive my ignorance


Ok, so this question is in regards to creditors willingness to haggle especially during downturns like we’re currently facing. 

For example, if I have an outstanding loan for $1000 payable for the next 1 year. Would it be possible to call the creditor and say I’ll pay you $800 right now if we can call this thing even. (Made up numbers if that matters).

Outside of traditional creditors, I know that it’s possible to negotiate gym memberships and even rent if you have cash up front. 

Past gym experience: paid 6 moths upfront in exchange for 25% discount. Same works for some landlords. 

Doesn’t this line of thinking extend to “traditional” lenders?

Does anyone have any insight into reducing debt payments through negotiation? Will settling for less than the full debt hurt your credit? 

During this downturn I think a lot of people will be willing to take a little less right now than to wait and ‘maybe’ get more later. Hopefully this extends to creditors.",4,1585426731,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqrny6/using_cash_to_negotiating_debt_repayment/,personalfinance,2

&gt; As you are aware, as part of our utility conservation program, you are responsible for various utilities including water, sewer, trash, and pest control. We thank you for being part of this program and wanted to provide an update on how you will be billed for these utilities.
 
&gt;Water and sewer are currently being billed based on sub-metered usage within your unit. In an effort to provide more fair billing to all tenants due to failing sub-meters, we will be switching to an allocated method going forward. This method is explained below. Please note that this letter will serve as notice of change per your lease agreement. You will begin seeing this change on your bills received in April, due with May’s rent.
 
&gt;Water and sewer charges will be calculated based on a square footage method. The total community’s water and sewer expense will be divided by the total number of occupied square feet at the community to calculate the per square foot amount. The per square foot amount is then multiple by the number of square feet in your unit to calculate the monthly water and sewer charge.

fqrjxz,Superwholock_14,Advice on moving and budgeting for my dream job?,"I got offered my dream job at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children’s hospital in Nashville, TN in their Pediatric ICU. However, my base pay is only going to be $25/hr, night shift from 7-10pm is $3 differential and 10p-7a is $3.50 differential (this is a night shift job but I will be on dayshift the majority of my 8-10 week orientation). Weekend differential is $6/hr. Work 4 weekend shifts (so 2 Friday’s, 2 Saturday’s or 4 Friday’s or however you want it) in a 6 week period and self scheduling. And they have really good tuition reimbursements through Vanderbilt for me to go back to school.

I really want to take this job. I currently work in a Neonatal ICU and the environment is so toxic. The managers suck and a lot of the nurses are just flat out mean and make your night a living Hell if you aren’t part of their “clique”. It’s a very clique-y, high school environment. However, I currently make $24.48/hr plus $2 differential for nights and $3 differential for weekends and then we also make a $2/hr “acuity” differential that basically says we’re so short staffed, please stay and we’ll give you an extra $2/hr. I’m also required to work 2 Friday’s, 2 Saturday’s, and 2 Sunday’s in a 4 week period, and we’re required to do 2 overtime shifts a month. So I make decent money, but the stress of this work environment and all the requirements and such are killing me. I’ve been here a year and a half and the requirements have gotten worse and the toxic environment has gotten worse. 

So I want a fresh start and I want to leave but Nashville is going to essentially end up paying me the same and it’s a double cost of living there. Plus I have a lot of credit card debt, student loans, and car debt that I want to pay off. Right now I pay about $900/month for rent &amp; utilities. And I’ve been able to pay $1250/month towards my credit card debt and student loans and $430/month towards my car. I know if I move to Nashville rent and utilities will end up costing me probably around $1300/month and with my car and phone payments that puts me around $1900/month before food and pet necessities and therapy and such. My take home pay for those 8-10 weeks of orientation is probably only going to be $2500/month. 

I know we’re about to get a $1200 stimulus check and Vandy is offering me a $3000 relocation bonus (it’s taxed and comes on my first paycheck) so now is kind of a good time to move as long as I can get decent overtime at Vandy.

fqrjdz,BernedTendies,"Clarification needed on contributing to 401k, Roth 401k, and IRA","Hi r/personalfinance. Thanks for helping me out with this confusion I have. I'm in the US, mid-twenties, make less than the $130k or whatever the Roth income limit is, laid-off from a job last month and will be starting another in a week from now and I have a few questions about contribution limits.

My apologies if the background info is too much, but I want to put everything out there so I don't need to answer questions later. Back in December, I was told there was a good chance my entire team was being cut in 2020. That ended up happening. To prepare for that, I upped my 401k and roth 401k contributions to 60% combined to take advantage of those tax advantageous retirement vehicles while I could since I knew I would be jobless for some months this year. I'm still technically an employee so will be able to contribute to my 401k for 4 months this year. After that, I will be receiving 3 months of severance which I can not put towards 401k. I guess now would be a good time to clarify that I come from some money, and I'm looking for answers purely from a tax advantage perspective. I don't need anyone telling me contributing 60% of my pay while looking in the face of unemployment is a crazy thing to do lol. I'll be ok even if I somehow get laid off in two months because this recession hits harder than people planned.

The job I will be starting a week from now does not allow me to contribute to their 401k plan until I've been there for a year, so I'll be looking to open an IRA and/or a Roth IRA. 

My first question is am I allowed to contribute $6k to a Roth IRA this year if I have already contributed more than that to a Roth 401k? Those are treated as two separate types of Roth, correct? 

Also, are the two types of IRAs considered the same type of retirement fund? I obviously can't have two 401ks at $19,500 for the year for a total of nearly $40k, so I'm assuming I can't have a Roth IRA and traditional IRA at $6k a piece for a total of $12k? I need to choose one, the other, or a balance of some sort until I hit $6k. 

This is more about convenience than tax implications:

Second, both jobs I've had since senior year of college had their 401k programs with Fidelity. I don't believe there are any ridiculous fees, and I like the amount of funds I have to choose from. Would you recommend rolling that over into an IRA, or should I just keep it in Fidelity since there are two, multi-year maxed 401ks there already? Should I open my new IRAs with Fidelity to keep it all conveniently in one place (one login)? 

Lastly, I haven't looked into what to do with my HSA at all. There is a small fee to keep it with HealthEquity. Do all jobs offer a HDHP? Idk what the health plan details are of my next job.

fqrizb,bz_treez,$1k extra fees on last mortgage invoice,"Hi PF, I hope this is appropriate here. I know a lot of real estate people are here.

My parents are finally about to pay off their house, which is amazing. Their last bill was for around $700 and they paid off $500. They expected their next bill to be \~$250, with the remaining principal and some interest/fees.

They were shocked when they got their invoice this month and it was $1200. $200 was principal and over $1000 was ""attorney and loan fees"". I have no idea what this could be, since attorney fees are normally at closing. It's also strange it's all due at once, with their normal payment only being $200 (they bought this house 30 years ago in rural Wisconsin).

They are going to call the bank, of course, but I feel they will try to explain it away and they'll just accept it. I'd like to give them some information if this is normal to make them more prepared.

I googled for ""last mortgage payment higher"" and ""attorney and loan fees"" but nothing comes up.

Thanks!

fqrfez,Speakersonicz,Using a credit card to pay off car loan to get reward,"Car loan- 18,000, paid off about 11,000. 4 year contract around 5% and the contract was started last year so I have 3 years of payment left but i'm paying it off 3 years early.

I have about 7000 dollars left on my car loan. What my idea is to apply for a rewards credit card where you spend xxx amount of dollars in xxx months, you'll get a 150 dollar bonus. 

Here is my plan: 

Bank of America cash rewards is def a solid choice due to the $200 dollar bonus for $1000 dollars. If I were approved for a 3000 cc limit at BOA, i'd then pay $2500 the first month so I can get the rewards and bonus. 

I would then pay that 2500 dollars in full and maybe use the card for gas purchases since it's 3% back on gas and 2 % back on groceries. 

It's only 1% on everything else, so I would then pay off my car loan using my chase rewards card which is at 1.5% for any purchases. 

Are there any other cc's I should research before doing this? If I were to pay off the car early, do I pay off interest for the remaining 3 years or if I paid off the car?",8,1585425994,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqrfez/using_a_credit_card_to_pay_off_car_loan_to_get/,personalfinance,1

fqrdjr,Unlikely_Grass,"Prioritizing liquidity vs. paying off $18,000 in credit card debt?","Hi everyone, using a throwaway account here for privacy reasons. Hoping to get some advice and guidance on our financial situation, thank you in advance! **Given the ongoing and upcoming economic fallout from COVID-19, we're not sure if we should continue to aggressively pay off our credit card debt or fully prioritize staying liquid (or where we might fall on the spectrum somewhere in between those two options).** Below is an overview of our situation.

**Income:**  
My partner is a software engineer making $88K/year. I work at a non-profit making $60K/year. We file taxes married but separate filings due to my federal student loans. Both of our employers have expressed that employees should not be concerned about job security in the short- to medium-term. My employer has even indicated that raises may be coming in the next few months. Obviously we are still being cautious, but both of our organizations/companies do not seem to be too impacted (yet) by what is going on. We are updating our resumes and still looking for other positions just in case.

* ***Total: $7715/month*** *(after taxes)*

**Expenses:**  
We live in NYC so rent is our largest expense at $2390/month. Utilities are included, and my organization reimburses internet expenses as I work from home. Below are a few other combined monthly expenses, excluding fitness and transportation as those are currently suspended due to COVID-19:

* Rent: $2390/month
* Therapy: $800/month
* Phone bill: $175/month (includes Netflix and other family members' bills that we cover)
* Groceries: $400-600/month
* Private educational loan: $488/month ($4800 remaining total)
* Federal educational loan: $165/month (\~$35000 remaining total; enrolled in PSLF program and paying minimum payments)
* Hulu: $7.99/month
* Spotify: $10/month
* Adobe subscriptions: $15/month
* Dental insurance: $39/month
* ***Total: $4150/month***

**Credit card debt:**  
Due to a big move a few years ago, a gap in employment, and some recent medical expenses, our total credit debt currently sits at \~$18K. Here is a breakdown:

* Credit card 1 (15.99% APR): $1897
* Credit card 2 (21.49% APR): $5400
* Credit card 3 (17.99% APR): $425
* Credit card 4 (0% APR until November 2020): $5056
* Credit card 5 (0% APR until January 2021): $5286
* ***Total: $18064***

**Savings:**  
None, unfortunately. We've been prioritizing paying off credit card debt before a recession hits. We weren't quick enough. We've been hit with unexpected expenses; for example, just a few months ago we lost $2200 due to a family emergency.

**Miscellaneous:**  
We wanted to include that we anticipate receiving \~$3000 for our tax returns here soon. We also anticipate we'll be receiving some of the stimulus checks if that is passed (\~$1700). We include this as we're not sure if that's money we should set aside in savings rather than put on our credit card debt as we had originally intended.

Again, our question is: **how do we balance or prioritize paying off our credit debts and building some emergency savings in the coming months?** Our instinct is to get rid of this credit card debt once and for all–we're *sick* of carrying it around–but I've heard that sound advice is to stay as liquid as possible during a potential recession (or worse). However, we do have medium confidence that we will keep our jobs in the short- to medium-term.

Thanks again in advance for your help, and hope everyone is staying as safe as possible.",34,1585425837,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqrdjr/prioritizing_liquidity_vs_paying_off_18000_in/,personalfinance,2

I always pay my balance before the closing date, so I proceeded to set up my account to pay online. I went ahead and entered my routing and account numbers to pay the first round of purchases at Ikea. After a week, I noticed that the balance was still the same and nothing had been withdrawn from my account. When I called them, i figured out they don't accept payments from SAVINGS accounts. I wasn't aware of this. Neither it stated it anywhere  on the webpage that I could ONLY make  payments from a checking account.

I immediately proceeded to set up my checking account for payment and paid my balance way before the closing date.

However, when I received my statement, it turns out, i owed nothing but a returned payment fee of $29.00

I immediately called and spoke with 2 agents plus a supervisor who told me there's nothing that they can do. That I have to pay and that I'm wasting my time (literally the supervisor said that). They told me I can't even write a letter to request a dispute on this specific type of fee.

Can anyone advise me if there's anything I can do about this?

It's very unfortunate because I paid my balance off before the closing date and the fact that their payment platform was not clear in this regard puts them at fault.

I know nothing about cars and up until now my intention was to go buy a beater for cash and get on the road ASAP, however my dad who is a car guy has opposed the idea. He's been loyal to a local Skoda dealership and pretty much everyone in family drives a Skoda bought from that dealership, he's on good terms with the guys in there and usually gets little extras and stuff. The dealership has a 2019 Skoda Citigo used at 10k, it's only got about 4k kilometers on it (was used by the garage for running errands) and my mother owned one for a number of years which gave her no troubles. The Citigo is particularly appealing as insurance rates here for my demographic are notoriously bad, anything over a 1.0L 65hp engine is going to be crazy expensive so this is the smallest engine I can buy pretty much. I've been advised by my parents that buying the Citigo with financing would be a much sounder option than buying a beater used, as they have had bad experiences with buying from second-hand garages in the past. The Citigo would include 3 years warranty which my dad says is a huge deal, even if the car is close to new and he knows its reliable. I'd be looking at a deposit of 2K with payments of about €155 a month on a 5 year contact, plus insurance and expected fuel I'd need to spend just under €400 a month to run the car. I've no debt but pay €400 a month in rent. I feel like it is a good decision and one I can currently afford, assuming my situation doesn't change with all the madness that is going on, however anytime I read up on buying that first car pretty much everyone seems to agree that buying a used beater is better and it has me doubting the decision. I'd hope to hold onto the car as long as possible and drive it into the ground, the low mileage and how new it is makes me feel confident in the decision but I would love to hear some input.",3,1585424905,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqr2w8/financing_my_first_car_is_it_a_good_idea/,personalfinance,1
fqr2pc,trapspeed3000,My credit score just jumped over 800 against all logic,"Tl;dr: Credit score jumped up inexplicably, I have a few theories on why and would like to get thoughts from folks more knowledgeable than me.

I've been chasing 800 for five or six years but was stuck in the 790s. Over the past month I applied for a large loan for an apartment building (hard pull but backed out of deal). I also ran up a huge amount on my cards because of a project I have going on (paid off early though). Yet this month my credit score jumped up well over 800.

These scores are complex machine learning models using lots of variables. The whole 10% is this 30% is that is a vast oversimplification. I've been trying to speculate what it could be that caused this jump. The only two things that are different are the loan application and the pandemic.

Curious about other people's thoughts on where I'm being dumb or might be onto something. But more importantly I'd love to hear everyone's ideas.

Theories so far -

1) Income and net worth are a factor and possibly an interaction term in the model. Most of my money is in commercial real estate and the market value normally wouldn't show up anywhere. If CBRE sold my personal financial statement to credit bureaus my actual net worth would be included.

2) Credit scores might be relative to other consumers. I (somehow) still have my job but at least 3.3m Americans were not as fortunate. So my income would look relatively better

3) Also working with the idea of relative scores, my credit limit is reasonably high. Everyone has spent a lot on their cards preparing for the pandemic. My utilization would looks better in comparison to the median consumer. Under this theory everyone with high limits will see a jump

4) Lenders are proactively seeing if people need special payment plans. This would have to be a ding on your credit. Since I've been so fortunate haven't I look comparatively better

Also, I just want to say if I'm coming off as a dick in any way it's not my intention. It's ripping me up inside to see what my friends in the service industry are going through. I'm aware and beyond grateful for how lucky I've been and am paying it forward at every chance I get.",20,1585424887,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqr2pc/my_credit_score_just_jumped_over_800_against_all/,personalfinance,0

such as kicking me to a lower tax bracket, getting that money back in taxes?

I only ask because last year I broke my arm at the beginning of the construction season and I was behind on bills, so when I went back to work I went tax exempt thinking it would only last a few months, I ended up going exempt all year (woops)

&amp;#x200B;

So last year I only made 42k, working only from 7/1/19 to the end of the year  I usually make 80-90k so I expected to owe back taxes on the 42k, if not make it back from going back to work this year.

To my surprise, I ended up breaking even with my work mileage deduction, HOME MORTGAGE INTEREST(8.2k) and standard deduction

so I started thinking, if it impacted me that much, is there a benefit from paying mortgage interest which is deductible in the coming years?

fqqsv9,oooo_ahahahah,I have been seeing several Auto Manufacturers offering 0% financing for 84 months...it’s a raw deal.,"PSA of sorts: So a few days ago i see a Jeep add in my Instagram feed boasting 0% financing for 84 months to select buyers. Sounds awesome, right? The thought of 100% of the monthly payment going to the principal intrigued me so I decided to dig a little deeper. I went to their website and it turns out there is a HUGE monthly fee instead of “interest”. If you qualify for 0% financing you are charged $11.90 per $1000 financed per month. So if you financed a $30k vehicle, your 0% financing is still costing you a premium of $357 per month on top of the principal. Yet another lesson in “if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is”.

EDIT: as /u/scooter214 pointed out, my assumption was wrong:

That is just a disclosure breaking down how much the payment will be. $1000 / 84 = $11.90. 100% goes to principal, not on top of principal.

fqqsjd,_AirForceJuan_,Investment Allocation,"Good quarantine everyone, (TL;DR below)

My extended free time has got me thinking about retirement, and I am kind of lost in the sauce trying to figure out what to do. I'll briefly summarize.

I am 22 years old, about to graduate college. Student loan debt is under $10,000 (blessed), and I commissioning as an officer and joining the National Guard. ROTC and scholarships are essentially my income, and with minimizing every expense I can I have a decent cushion of savings. So I put about 5k into a tdameritrade account.

They are sitting on SPY ETFs since this whole ""health situation"" has sent markets tumbling. I figured this was an easy win for the long term. However, is this really advisable? Should I wait until I break even, and just transfer my balance into something like a Roth IRA. I am currently unemployed, but if I pick up a job I should be able to make enough to be in the lowest tax bracket. This would make my contributions cheaper, and I need to get a job anyway once I graduate.

 So, what would any of you suggest be a good course of action? I'm not asking for necessarily step by step, just general tips or ideas to look into.

fqqmsx,Patnix5,What should I invest in when I can afford to be risky?,"Background: 

I'm 24 and a graduate student with a pretty high paying internship at the moment (not sure how important this is but I'm graduating this December with Masters in Computer Engineering). I have a total of around $8000 to my name. I live at home so pretty much all my income is disposable at this point. Whilst working roughly 25 hours a week I make around $2400/month. In the last few months (starting around December) I've been investing into a Acorns Invest account (my first time investing) $20 a day (total investment to date is \~$1200). Over the past few weeks I've been doing some research and saw that it is better to be putting this money into a 401k (which I don't have as an intern) and/or Roth IRA. Therefore, I opened a fidelity account and was about to open a Roth IRA and start investing $50 a day to max it out for 2019 (which should be possible now that the roth ira contribution date has been extended to mid july). 

&amp;#x200B;

What I need help with:

I realized that I find myself in a situation that presents an opportunity to do something more, potentially. The general advice on YouTube videos, blogs, and reddit forums is to match your 401k, max your roth ira, and diversify your investments. That is sound advice ALWAYS. However, in that way your money grows slowly, thanks to compound interest, and eventually say around age 60 you can pull a big sum out. For many, that's more than worth it. For me, I'm wondering if I can speed that up. Just as a disclaimer I'm not simply being impatient but rather don't see the point in getting millions at age 60 (i.e. what if I die before then...what if I'm disabled and can't use it...what if I just don't have much use for that money at that age...etc). I understand that retirement money is useful so I don't have to keep working forever and I do plan to invest in my 401k and Roth IRA when I get a job in January 2021 (hopefully). But what about now? 

&amp;#x200B;

What I've looked into:

1. Investing in individual stocks (i.e Microsoft, AMD, Intel...things I understand due to my field of study). They are down to half price or close to right now and are fairly safe in my opinion. Buying  $7000 of them could double my investment in the next couple years or sooner, I assume).
2. Investing in hotel/airline stocks that have seen big declines as well. Saber Corporation (SABR), for example, dropped from \~23 to $3 at one point (now at \~$6). Admittedly, I understand less about these stocks but have been trying to do my research via Yahoo Finance. 
3. Investing in Volatility Funds like  **iPath Series B S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX** ) which from my understanding behaves inversely to that of the S&amp;P 500. Again, I understand even less about this particular fund. I do know that it is a pessimistic outlook and you are essentially investing in fear and the face that the market will decline (which it looks like is the case at this moment in time). Essentially, if the S&amp;P 500 drops 5%, VXX could rise even more i.e. 15%.
4. Options Trading. I looked into this option and this feels a bit more like gambling (at least when you don't know how to do i right) so I probably won't do this even though it likely has the largest potential gains.
5. Lastly, stick to the common advice and just max out my Roth IRA by mid July 2020. Use any remaining money to open a brokerage account (I'm using Fidelity) to invest in Index funds with an Aggressive portfolio since I'm still young (100% in S&amp;P 500? Like VOO). That's likely not diversified enough but I am aim for as aggressive as possible for the next few month to take advantage of the lower prices (please correct me if I sound like I have not idea what I'm talking about)

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Might have sounded very ignorant above since I've just started investing and may not understand a lot but I could use some help to see what options are good and which ones are not.

fqqij8,hairinthewind,Can I refinance a private student loan?,"Back in 2007 my father took out a Sallie Mae 5140 Tuition Answer loan, I started paying it back in 2009. For the first few years while I still lived at home, I would just hand my dad a check and he would send it off. Once I moved away he let me log in to the account (which was now acquired by Navient) and I just put in my bank account info and have been doing auto payments ever since. 

I understand I should have been proactive in all this, but I was young and clueless about any of this and trusted my dad had made good decisions on my behalf. Now, here I am, laid off from my job and thinking ""hmm how can I save money, let me look at these student loans, maybe I can refinance"". My interest rate is 6.75% which seems insanely high. I want to refinance but the loan is completely in my dads name. I am listed as the student, but I wasn't a cosigner. My dad claims that the loan in private and can't be refinanced. 

I don't know much about loans, but I thought all loans could be refinanced? I want everything transferred to my name so I can just deal with it myself, but I don't know if that is possible if I am not a cosigner. As mentioned, I am pretty clueless so I was hoping someone could answer a couple questions because google left a lot lacking in regards to loans through Navient.

I'm looking for specific advice as to whether to pay it, settle it, or let it age off of my credit report and what the consequences will be.

The debt is $2,200 that is charged off as bad debt and still with Chase.  According to Experian it is only on record until April of 2021!  I'm now in a financial situation where I could pay it off (or attempt to settle it) but I don't want to risk paying it and it showing up as paid but charged off for another seven years from the payment date.

I'm also interested in using Chase cards and rewards programs in the future.  Do any of you know if this will charge off in their internal system as well as on my credit reports after that April 2021 or prevent me from getting approved for a CSR in the future? It's not a HUGE sacrifice to give up on their future rewards programs, but it does seem like one of the better ones to take advantage of eventually.

My gut tells me that I should just wait until April next year at this point and let it fall off (my credit score is already up to 704 even with this late payment showing up every month), but I wanted to get a second set of experienced eyes on this.

fqqeys,stxphh01,Loss of income - what to do?,"Some context for this situation- I’m currently a high school senior (f18), and my parents have been divorced for 10 years. I have two siblings - a twin (f18), and a senior in college (f23). My mother gave up work to be a stay at home mom (20 years ago), and for a long time we survived on child support and alimony (my dad makes $120k). Over the last 10 years, they’ve been in court constantly, and eventually my dad was able to stop paying alimony &amp; lower his child support payments. My mom has supported us by receiving disability (needs double knee surgery, can’t afford it) and social security, along with the roughly 30k/year in child support. It’s not easy. We struggle a lot for basic necessities and often use the food pantry to get by. 

Today, she got a notice from her lawyer in the mail that said my dad would be stopping child support payments in May. This was way earlier than we were expecting (we thought they would at least last the summer) and are now panicking about what to do. Without the child support, my mother would receive roughly $1000/month for a family of 4. Both my siblings and I know that we need to get jobs, but with everything shut down, the likelihood of that seems slim. My twin and I are going to college next year, and my older sibling was planning on moving back in with my mom.

One possible positive is my mom wants to sell our house and move into an apartment, so maybe the money from that could sustain us for a while? IDK, with the way the economy is looking, it might be a long time before we can sell.

My question is once I get to the point every year where I hit the $19,500 mark on my 457, should I start contributing to my 401k or should I open a Roth IRA with say Vanguard instead?  I don’t know a lot about IRA’s. Is there usually a minimum age to withdraw funds if needed?  Can it be taken out before retirement?

fqq3oe,b0bbybitcoin,"30 year old with ~$60k with a personal advisor. I'm wondering if you agree or disagree with this recent move, and if you were me would you stay with him or withdraw and do your own thing?","Most of it is money my parents invested when I was born that was intended for college. College started in 2008 and the investment tanked so they just left it alone. I went paperless because I didn't want to think about it, but happened to check it today and it didn't take as much of a beating as I thought it would have (compared to my 401k and 457k) because it was invested in 2 different pretty stable low risk funds. 

Why is it in a low risk fund? Why hasn't the ""advisor"" ever tried to contact me with suggestions on changing what it's invested in to better fit a 30 year old? 10k of it was given to me by my 90 year old grandfather a few years ago and I never realized that it was invested in an account for someone that's in retirement! They just transferred the shares out of his name over to me. WHY didn't the advisor talk to me and discuss putting that gift in a better fund for me the day it was transferred? Today it's only grown $1500 to $11500....that could have easily doubled if it was managed properly. 

I know it's probably not a lot of money to the advisor, but it is to a 30 year old civil service worker who 1.  wants to buy a house in NYC in the near future and 2. doesn't have one yet because they are so fucking expensive. Why didn't this advisor contact me during this insane sell off or somewhere near the bottom a week or two ago to discuss my options? Why did I have to reach out to this guy to light a fire under his ass? I've seen other posts where advisors recommended moving the money into bonds, or liquidating it completely and just let it sit there until this covid problem is over and done with. 

Is it me? Am I being too critical? Or is this guy a jerkoff?

Anyway I called up yesterday, I haven't met this guy yet (Our old advisor was my dad's friend who retired a few years ago and this guy took over our accounts). I told him right away I wanted everything moved to my etrade account because I want to invest the money myself. Told him that I'm not my parents, that I know a little more about this stuff than the average person and that I will be fine on my own.  I guess he didn't like that because he started stuttering like crazy and didn't know what tonsay. Asked me what I do for a living. Told him I'm a firefighter. He goes ""would you listen to me for direction on how to put out a fire? Will you let me tell you where to put the water? This is what I do I've been in this business for 30 years now."" (side note: I don't give a fuck about his 30 year time bomb he dropped on me and his questions pissed me off. I'd rather a kid my age who appreciates my business and is going to come to me with ideas manage my money)

****I agreed with him (for now). We decided on buying 70 shares of Boeing, 400 shares of ExxonMobil, and $30k/465 shares of $FDYNX Franklin DynaTech C.****

Maybe im wrong. Do you think him letting me do put half the money into those 2 stocks is a good move? Should I just listen to him? I'd like to hear what you guys think. I don't need this money for retirement I would like it within the next 3 to 5 years. I already have ~100k put away in my retirement accounts, a pension, and other personal investments that will be more than enough when I retire. Which is why I wanted to just take control of the funds myself and do my own thing with it because I feel like with where the market is and the research I've been doing, I will easily be able to triple it on my own. I don't care if it's dangerous. I know to do that we have to be risky.  I also don't give a fuck if we take chances to try for nice potential gains and lose it all (because I don't care how much it can possibly turn into if I leave it alone for 30 more years).

fqphry,deadpixel11,28 first time home buying help,"I'm currently unemployed but this upcoming week I have a third and final interview for a position about 2 hours away. I'll be making more than I ever expected I would in my current area, and the company offers ""a very competitive relocation package"".  Obviously the job isn't mine yet, but I like being prepared going into things.

The location is a smaller town with few decent rentals (I've only ever rented).  This led me to start thinking about buying a home, which is a process I'm totally unfamiliar with. The houses in the area start around 150k and up, all old victorian's and farm houses.

My credit score on credit karma sits between 610 and 630, which from my understanding doesn't factor in the same things lenders do. So I want to prepare for the worst and hope for the best, so I'm trying to factor things from a worst case 600 score. 

I have basically no savings, the loss of my job in January really drained my funds.  I'm not familiar with relocation packages, so I'm not sure if they can help fund a down payment and closing costs. 

I've also read that you can get what's called a job offer loan, using an offer letter as proof of income. 

I guess what I'd like to know is do I even have a shot at this?
How are relocation packages handled? And what is ""very competitive"" (in case region matters: Midwest, Iowa, Illinois) 

Also there seems to be so many lending options, how do I know the lender I go with is looking for the best possible way to make things work?

I hope you are staying safe and feeling well!  I have an existing credit card account with AMEX (Delta SkyMiles) that I opened in 2015.  I received a new credit card from them the other day in the mail.  The card design is an upgrade from the previous iteration, so I assumed they are simply sending out new cards to existing account holders.  However, after a closer look, I noticed the new card states that I have been an account holder since 2010, not 2015.  My parents claimed they did not open this account for me.  I then generated a credit report to investigate further and, lo and behold, the report reflects this 2010 account as well as my 2015 account.  The account has had a 0-balance since its opening in 2010.

I could use some advice on how to proceed.  On one hand, I do not feel comfortable without knowing how or who opened this account in my name.  On the other hand, the account has a non-trivial credit limit and has been a 0-balance account for the last 10 years, undoubtedly reflecting well on my credit score.  I could keep the account open and at 0-balance as it would continue to improve my credit.

She replied that my salary was supported in the first couple of months while they were sending me my work computer and figuring out what I was going to be working on.

Is this really how it works? The way I see it, I was available to work during those months, and I did have meetings with the team, etc. so it’s only fair that they would pay me.

A few questions about the latest news about the loan suspension:

(1) Everything I'm reading seems to imply that all federal loan lenders are supposed to cease billing people within 15 days I believe. Does that mean we as borrowers need to request a forbearance before then, or does it happen automatically? 

(2) MyFedLoan currently says I have a payment due on April 14th which would normally be paid via autopay. Will that be pulled from me like normal, or should the loan suspension prevent the payment from happening?

I just got my new pay statement and to my surprise, it didn’t go down much. I am withholding an additional $110 in federal, it looks like with  that additional $110 amount, my net pay dropped $50.

Maybe a dumb question, but I would’ve thought adjusting this would’ve just caused my federal tax amount to increase $110. For example if I was getting taxed $100 federal on my wages I thought it would’ve gone to $210.

fqoptx,morice8869,Is it worth keeping my current financial planner/advisor?,"**Basics** - My wife and I are in our 20s and make $130,000/year total with very little debt and a good amount of money to manage/invest. We meet with a financial advisor at Raymond James every so often to discuss investments and 401k contributions.

**Fees** - I keep seeing that fee-only is better. I've been looking into it but I don't understand what that is and what the other options are, especially for our particular financial situation. I'm looking now and it says we have an annualized fee of 1.25%, which is typically only for $10M+ accounts. We somehow got that lower fee grandfathered in unless it's some kind of sales gimmick.

**TL;DR info:**

1. Making $130k and meeting with Raymond James to manage investments.

2. What is fee-only? Is Raymond James fee-only? Would a different fee-structure be better for our situation or should we be doing this ourselves?

3. Should we be concerned that our investments weren't pulled out before this huge dip in the market? Did any advisors anticipate it?

4. Any other generally useful information or resources?

I don't know a lot about this so I'm trying to get a sense that it's at least a decent situation for us. In short, should we stay with Raymond James, find someone else, or do it ourselves?",24,1585417368,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqoptx/is_it_worth_keeping_my_current_financial/,personalfinance,2
fqoptb,Hackasizlak,Moving in with Friends - Rent Payments,"Last week I moved in with two close friends of mine (husband/wife) from college. They just bought a big house in the Chicago suburbs and invited me to move in with them. I now have a bedroom and a living room that are my own. It's all the space I need. We've been avoiding the subject of rent because it's just awkward, but I want to resolve it soon. 

I've already offered to pay 1/3 of utilities, food, house supplies etc., but some rent should be on top of that. For reference, I make 75k a year at my new job, and their mortgage is in the vicinity of 3k a month. If I was to rent a decent apartment in the area, it would probably be in the $1500 a month range. I'd like to pay substantially less than that because I have 20k of student loans I want to finally get rid of, and I wouldn't be able to do that  quickly if I was throwing about a quarter of my take home pay at monthly rent. At the same time I want to be fair to them and not make it seem like I'm ""mooching."" 

Does anyone have any thoughts or experience with something similar for what a fair monthly rent to propose to them would be?",9,1585417366,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqoptb/moving_in_with_friends_rent_payments/,personalfinance,2

fqokr5,kessenma,Financial Planner asking for password to bank account,"TLDR; **Is it an industry standard for financial advisors to ask for bank account information and passwords?**

Hey! I've been a long-time learker on this sub-reddit and I really appreciate this space. I graduated with a bachelors degree last Spring (2019) and now I have my first salaried job. About a month ago a person with the title ""Financial Planner / Investment Advisor"" at Morgan Stanley (who is a mutual connection with my supervisor at my job) sent me a message + connection request on LinkedIn. The message he sent me in his connection request is: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hey \[*my name redacted*\]!   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Im working with many people at \[*company name redacted*\] right now, and reaching out to younger employees to offer complimentary investment advice, or planning, for the next month.  I'm finding that some want to be in the market but aren't sure where to start.  Are you free to chat real quick?   
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks!   
&gt;  
&gt;\[advisors *name redacted*\]

&amp;#x200B;

I took the bait and said I was interested -- because I do have some extra cash that I would like to invest. We chatted on the phone for 30 min about; 

* How much I have to invest and how much debt I currently have
   * \~$1k/month / student loans are paid off and living at my parents so not many bills currently
* What his motivations are in helping me
   * He said he wants to help out younger people when they don't have much wealth, so that when they are worth a  trusted relationship is already formed
* What he would do with my money 
   * Said he would start with investing in Microsoft and ""Vanguard 500 Index Fund; ETF"" 
* Which bank accounts I should put my money in 
   * Told me to put money in Charles Schwab cuz of low trading fees (I think that's why). He worked for Morgan Stanley, but advises new clients not to invest with Morgan Stanley early on because they have high fees and it is not worth it for people with &gt;$100k.
* My future professional goals
   * I'm interested in pursuing a technical PhD in a couple years

After this conversation everything seemed normal and he told me to set up a Charles Schwab account and put some money in it. I did so, and put in $2k. After I did that he asked me to send him over my password... This freaked me out a little bit. Our conversation is below: 

**Me**: Okay I linked my Bank of America account. I think I will be able to have money in my CS account by early next week.

&gt;Awesome  
&gt;  
&gt;All Set up?

**Me**: Ya. I should have money in the account by tomorrow 

&gt;Cool   
&gt;  
&gt;Good Timing 

**Me**: Hey I have money set up in my account now

&gt;Niiice  
&gt;  
&gt; What's your username and password?

**Me**: Hi \[*Name redacted*\], I’m not too comfortable with giving that information out. Is there another way to work together without doing that? Or is this how you work with all your clients?

&gt;You need to have a different password than your usual one. I can advise you, but I won't be able to monitor your account

fqnmei,BilllisCool,Should I still contribute 8% of an upcoming $35k payment from my job to my 401k?,"Due to a commission accounting error, it turns out my company owes me about $35k from last year. They’re going to pay it all at once on my next check. Typically I contribute 8% of my check to my 401k and my company does a 50% match towards that amount.

Right now, my 401k is at about $3000 as I just started this job and just started contributing last year.

Since I met this savings milestone, I began contributing 25% of my income to my 401(k) as of late last/early this year; my employer matches 100% up to 6%, and I’ve at least taken advantage of this since they started matching six months from my start date.

fqnhya,shenquay,Advice on what to do with saved money,"Just looking for advice on what I should do with the money me and my wife have saved up over the year(s). Our savings has enough to cover our expenses for around a year. I know we don't need to have that big of an emergency fund so recently I've been looking at what we can do with it. Before the Corona craze, a friend of mine I trust advised getting a house, as me and my wife have been in an apartment for 3 years. We got a pre-approval and made an offer on one house but sellers chose another offer. We haven't found anything since. My grandpa knows a lot about stock markets and he advised me earlier this week to start investing the money we would use for a house and put it in stocks.

I've done some basic research online and on this subreddit. I'm looking into what my company matches on 401k and will start contributing to that asap. The next thing that seems to be on the list is to pay off high-interest debts. Right now, we don't have a lot of debt. I have a little student debt but the interest rate is low so not really motivated to pay it off. We have a car loan and have been making bigger payments than the minimum to pay it off quicker.

I make \~$60k per year, have $0 in debt and \~$25k in investments / cash.  My recurring monthly expenses are about $1200.  To continue with my current car, I need to put $2500 in as repairs, which I am not willing to do.  I'm not really sure what the ""best"" / ""most logical"" route to take is.   It seems like buying new is bad decision.  However, I don't want to buy another beater, as I'm sick of always crossing my fingers that my car will start and, for the first time, I would like have a functioning AC.  I also looked into leasing, but the consensus seems to be that is an inferior option.  Further, I'm hesitant to expend a large amount up front, as I would like to invest as much as possible right now considering the current market conditions.  I realize there are quite a few constraints here obviously I will have to give up something.  Any thoughts?

Now, though, Navient rejected the paperwork he submitted to continue his income-based payments, and his monthly payments are about to skyrocket to 5k/month. He has no job, and his plan was to live off his wife’s retirement, but she passed away last fall, leaving him two nice-but-not-that-nice houses, one of which still has a mortgage and is being sold. He has no retirement accounts, except for some cash savings that are definitely not enough to pay back the loans; even if he does pay the 5k/month, those savings won’t last long. 

He’s worried that he’ll be homeless if he can’t continue the payments. He’s thought about transferring his limited assets to my name, but I’m not sure if that’s legal (we’re in Colorado, if that makes a difference). He also owes my mom money, which I desperately want him to pay back first. Ideally, I’d also like to have some assets available for my brother when my dad passes. 

Should he transfer assets and go into default? Or pay the 5k/month and then go into default when cash runs out? 

Also, if you think there are terms or loopholes that you think he should explore, please comment them. I’m going to try to get him to meet with an attorney soon about this, and it’d be nice to have some direction.

fqmpe5,danabanaanaaa,Tax questions. Pls help asap.,"Decided to make a separate post for this question. Please bare with me, I'm a 23 year old college student who just got fired and is now going insane with the uncertainty of these stimulus checks.

I filed my taxes earlier this month, and I filed as dependent since I do still live under my moms roof. I pay my portion of rent and handle all of my own finances and pay for my own schooling, however I file as dependent because my mom needs the money more than I do and she will still give me some of what she gets from her taxes. It's just been simpler and hasn't made a huge difference for me, or so I thought. 

Long story short, my mom told me that she did not file me as one of her dependents this year. (And I checked the previous 3 years, and she had not filed me as a dependant of hers) But I already submitted my taxes as a dependant and I don't know what this means as far as the stimulus checks. 

Will I have to amend my tax return and file as independent? Will I still get the stimulus check because no one claimed me? I don't know since I filed as dependent. I have not received my return for this year yet, so if I do choose to amend it, should I wait until I receive my return? And should I be expecting to receive a larger amount? Does anyone know how this affects financial aid?

In the long run, did I end up losing a lot of money by filing as dependent even though no one was claiming me?

I focused mainly on index funds and blue chip companies, and then pulled all my money in early February (although I wanted to go earlier) because I felt as if we were overdue for a major recession. Anyhow, I feel like I have a firm ground level of the stock market for FIRE. 

1. Long term is the only thing worth it
2. Once the money is there, don't touch it. It might as well not exist. If there is a dip, don't be a dipshit and sell. Never sell at a loss in fact. Just bide your time. (whoops broke this rule)
3. Index fund all the way. Later on in life, i'll likely diversify into real estate but tenants are a major pain in my ass. Tech companies are more fun higher risk higher reward investments 
4. Never sell at a loss
5. Never make a decision based on an emotion

fqm7bd,Sltz,26 drowning in debt,"Hi all,

I’m 26. I make about $68k/year.

*Monthly bills*
&gt;Rent: $500
&gt;Car: $380 (still owe ~ 9k, interest rate 2%)
&gt;Wedding stuff: $500 
&gt;Utilities: $150
&gt;Gym membership: $35

Currently have ~11k saved in the bank.

Here’s the kicker. Here is why I am drowning: I owe over $250k in student loans. I am on an income based repayment plan. My monthly payments are $100/month but I pay over every month. I pay at least $1000/month. My loan amount has only INCREASED since I’ve been paying on it, despite my large payments. 

I have a lot of guilt bc of these loans. The return on investment was terrible. I get that.

On top of all this, my fiancé would like us to buy a house. If we bought a house in the $150-170k range, our monthly mortgage payment would be the same OR less than our current rent payment ($1000/month). Would this be a horrid financial move for me right now??

So I guess what I’m looking for here is some advice. What do I need to do to get this loan to go away? Do I need to switch plans to maybe a 30 year? Do I need to make MINIMUM payments only for 30 years and eventually the half a million plus debt will be forgiven? 

And would it be a poor decision to buy a house with my fiancé? 


If anyone can direct me to someone who does online Skype/FaceTime in depth financial counseling for millennials who have taken out way too many loans please provide me a link.

fqlanz,Senoanon,Trying to get back on my feet and could use some advice,"First of all, sorry if this turns into what seems like a rant.  I'll try to only include things that I think are relevant for context.  Thank you in advance to anyone willing to read/offer advice in this trying time.

I live in Virginia and recently went through a very difficult time mentally and physically which made me lose my last job in approximately July of 2018.  I was living alone in a house which I had a mortgage for and I had some money saved up.  Without going too much into the details of what I was going through personally I wasn't sure that I had the willpower or even the desire to get back on my feet and things just kept getting worse.  So I lived off of my savings for as long as I could without any financial plan whatsoever.  I stopped paying my mortgage a while back despite still having some money in savings and the house was eventually sold in foreclosure and I was evicted at the end of February 2020.  Fortunately I decided shortly before that happened that I did want to try to get back on my feet again and to not give up yet.  So I took a friend up on their offer to let me live with them while I try to do exactly that.  So about a month ago I moved in with them (living in their house which they have a mortgage on).  They have told me that all they expect from me financially is to pay my share of utilities (although I would like to try to give them more when I can).  At the point of moving in with them I decided to use some of my savings to pay off my credit card debt and student loans which were delinquent.  My plan when moving in with them was to start classes to become a CNA and apply for jobs as a resident assistant in an assisted living facility.  After paying off my debts I had about $3,000 leftover to last me until I was able to find a job as a resident assistant.  I knew that there was a chance that I would need to find an in-between job as well doing something like working in a grocery store or whatever I needed to do to make money in the short term which I'm not opposed to, but I figured on being able to finish the ~6 weeks of classes and apply for the job I intended on keeping before needing to do that.  And then coronavirus really started ramping up which means I won't be starting classes to become a CNA anytime soon most likely.  I am also hesitant to go work in a grocery store or something right this second partly because I don't have health insurance and can't afford a doctor visit let alone a potential hospital stay.  But also the wife of the couple who is letting me stay with them has lung issues as is so we are trying to be particularly careful about not bringing the virus into the house yet.  I talked to them about these issues in regards to getting a job and they agreed that it would be best to wait for a little bit to see what sort of assistance the government is going to offer since this is clearly a difficult time financially for a lot of people.  Which brings me to my next concern.  The $1,200 stimulus would greatly help me during this time, but I have heard that it may not make it if you haven't filed taxes in 2018 or 2019.  I haven't filed for unemployment since I lost my job nor have I filed taxes in either 2018 or 2019.  My only source of ""income"" since I lost my job was when I pulled the ~$15,000 out of my 401k.  I do know that the money that I did make in 2018 and the taxable income from the 401k in 2019 should give me money back (ie I don't owe money as a result of not filing my taxes in those years, but rather should be owed some money).  However, I don't have any information about the money that I did make so I'm not sure how to even go about filing what I am able to file.  So to sum this up into discreet questions:

* Should I file for unemployment now and if I do would the recent change by the VA governor about not looking for employment apply to me?  I don't know if there is a distinction between people having lost their job as a result of coronavirus (where it seems like the aid is mostly directed) and me not being able to begin my job search as a result of the virus despite being out of work for an extended period of time - or if that distinction even matters.
* How would I even go about attempting to file my taxes?
* Is it even possible that I'll still be able to get the $1,200 stimulus given that I haven't filed 2018 or 2019 taxes yet?
* Can you offer any advice in general on what I should be doing to get back on my feet?",9,1585406141,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqlanz/trying_to_get_back_on_my_feet_and_could_use_some/,personalfinance,1

fql8ci,NormalWaterBottle,Wash sale questions for multiple brokerages,"Example:

3/10/20 I bought VTI in my vanguard brokerage 

3/12/20 I bought VTSAX in my vanguard ira

3/14/20 I sold VTI for loss in my vanguard brokerage(was trying to tax loss harvest) 

I now learned that 30 days prior to sale if you bought the same thing (or similar)then it’s a wash sale(previously thought it was only after).

Question 1: I am weighing rebuying VTI in my vanguard brokerage since tax loss harvest is ruined due to the VTSAX ira purchase. By doing this my brokerage would not report the loss and would just add the avg to my new purchase. 

Does anyone see any issues with this?

Question 2: could I just sell the VTSAX in the ira and then both would be at loss and the VTI in brokerage would then no longer be a wash sale? I could then rebuy VTSAX in the ira after 30 days?

Question 3:

Robinhood 3/10/20 purchase 15 shares of Apple
Vanguard 3/11/20 purchase 10 shares of Apple
Robinhood 3/12/20 purchase 5 shares of Apple
Robinhood 3/14/20 sell 20 shares of Apple at loss
Vanguard 3/15/20 sell 10 shares of Apple at loss

In this scenario robinhood would calculate wash sale but not take into account the vanguard buy. Since all shares were sold would I need to do anything special aside from uploading the forms from robinhood and vanguard to TurboTax?

fqkxry,cos,"Ask for a mortgage forbearance, or will it cause problems later?","I have a couple of mortgages from last year.  I was about to start a new job this month, but they had to cancel that because their business is heavily affected by the pandemic, so now I'm searching for a job.  Since my not having a job now is a direct result of covid-19, I should be able to get forbearances on my mortgage payments.  However, I have two concerns about this:

1. I think my odds of getting a job within the next month or two are pretty good, given my skills and qualifications.  If that happens, mortgage rates will likely still be *much* lower than they were last year when I got these two mortgages, and I'll want to refinance both immediately.  Will having asked for a forbearance now, work against me if I apply to refinance in a month or two?

2. Banks are being cagey about what they'll do beyond the immediate.  Both lenders' written policies suggest that they might let me delay payment for a few months, but then ask for me to catch up very quickly after those few months pass.  Having to make 4 payments in quick succession after three months, doesn't seem any better than just making those payments on their regular schedule, since I don't expect the economic slump to recover anywhere near that quickly.  But maybe there is legislation coming soon that will make mortgage lenders do better, and give more clarity - for example, make them promise to extend the term of any loan that got a forbearance due to covid19, so that the missed payments get tacked on to the end of the term.  But if I ask for a forbearance under current terms, maybe I won't be as protected as I would be if the rules change in the borrower's favor soon?

After the May 1st payments, I'm going to probably need to sell some mutual funds or bond funds to keep going into the summer if I'm still unemployed.  I have plenty in those, even after the recent crash - I could keep making payments into next year easily.  But this is a bad time to be selling those long term investments, when they're so low - it would definitely hurt my long term savings to have to do so now.  For the moment, I can ride it out and wait, since I definitely have enough straight-up cash for April and May living expenses.  But I'd like to also know more generally what people think about forbearances, whether it's better to wait if I can, and whether they'll have an impact on refinancing?",2,1585404902,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqkxry/ask_for_a_mortgage_forbearance_or_will_it_cause/,personalfinance,1

fqkicm,aRVAthrowaway,Will you get a credit under the recently passed CARES Act?,"A lot of people are wondering whether or not they get a credit under the recently-passed CARES Act and, is so, what amount that credit might be. And I've seen some confusion across reddit on how exactly that credit is calculated. And it doesn't help [the IRS hasn't updated their site with any information yet either](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus), but obviously turn there for more info once they do.

I created this post as a resource to hopefully answer those questions. This isn't and is not intended to be all-encompassing, but hope it helps clarify how the credit is calculated for a vast majoirty and helps you figure out what your credit amount might be. I'll be updating as people comment and correct me on things I inevitably got wrong, so please comment if you see something that's wrong.

# What tax return is used?

If you've already filed your 2019 tax return, they'll use that. If you haven't, they'll use your 2018 return. There are various other tax and income situations, so if you fall under these, it's probably better to wait until IRS guidence comes out to answer those situations, so I won't delve into them here.

# What is my income?

The income they're using for the purposes of the credit is your adjusted gross income (AGI). It's listed on Line 7 of your tax return.

# Who counts as a child?

They use the same definition for ""qualifying children"" as your tax return does ([24c](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/24)). That generally means if you usually claim them as a dependent child on your tax return, they'll count under this credit.

# How is the credit calculated?

Basically, every individual technically starts out with the same amount, additional amounts get added for children, and then the total credit phases out with income above a certain income threshold until it gets to $0 (in which case you wouldn't get a credit). So, let's break it down.

**How do you file?**

First, we need to figure out your filing status. Do you usually file single, head of household, or joint? This will determine what your initial base credit will be. 

If you file single or head of household, your base credit at this point will be $1200.

If you file joint, your base credit at this point will be $2400.

**Do you have children?**

You get an additional $500 credit for each child. So, multiply $500 by the amount of children you have (i.e. $500 for 1 child; $1000 for 2; $1500 for 3, etc.) and add that to the base credit above.

**Do you make too much to get all or part of the credit?**

This is the part that most people I've seen on reddit get  wrong. Some are claiming the income just hard stops at $98K/$198K/etc. It doesn't (if you have kids). Some are claiming the child credit is tacked on at the end. It's not. It phases out based on your income just like the first part of the credit. So, this section will deal with how to calculate your payment if you make over the initial phase-out threshold, and it's pretty simple to calculate.

Read the rest of this section if any of these three situations apply to you:

* If you file single, and have an income over $75,000
* If you file head of household, and have an income over $112,500
* If you file joint, and have an income over $150,000

If you make above the amounts listed above, simply take 5% of the amount of income you make above that level and **subtract** it from the total credit you've calculated so far. **That's your final credit. It's that simple.** 

This equates to a complete phase-out for people filing single with no kids at $99,000, no kids and joint at $198,000, etc. **But, your income can be higher than that and you still receive a credit if you have children.** For example, let's say you and your spouse's income are $200,000 altogether, and you have two kids that qualify. You’d have a base credit of $3,400 ($2,400 joint + $500 child + $500 child). You'd take 5% of your income above $150,000 (so, 5% of $50,000, or $2,500). And then you'd subtract that amount from your base credit (so, $3,400 - $2,500, or $900). So, you’d still get a $900 credit with that income and two kids.

# How and where will the credit be sent?

They'll use the direct deposit details and most recent address from the tax return they're using above to direct deposit the payment into your account. if they don't have your details or you've closed that account, then the IRS will mail you a check to the most recent address they have on file. They'll then follow up with a letter with contact details if you didn't receive your payment for various reasons (change of address, change of bank info, etc.).

But if I did this, the dividends from the new funds wouldn't initially be qualified until after the holding period so would be taxed as regular income. Since I'm now in a tax bracket with 0% tax on capital gains and qualified dividends, wouldn't I be better off just to leave the VASGX alone for now? Raising the basis doesn't seem to have much benefit in a 0% tax bracket and I'm sure to lose on the taxation of the dividends.

I admit that the car is not in the best shape it could be, but I was younger when I bought it and not very experienced/mature about these things. I got a new job recently, so I really just want to start over with a new vehicle in the same price range. 

The trade-in value for my car is $4500, but I expect to get less than this (the key fob is completely shattered and the interior is not particularly clean). I am willing to settle for anything above $3000. This way, I would only have to pay $1200 off the remainder of the loan once the $3000 is applied. Next, I suspect that I am looking to take out the new car loan at $5000, which is fine by me. After all of this is done, I expect to be paying $30/month on the previously financed car loan and $100/month on the new car loan.

I work for a fairly large company and our work is measured through production. Once we meet this production standard for 3 months in a row, we get a promotion and a  3% raise. I met this standard on November 1st. I now have multiple emails dating back to November for proof of me asking for the status (I work remotely). Her response is always the same “I will keep following up with HR and upper management and I hope to hear more next week.”  “It was so close to the end of the year and our bonuses that things are taking longer.” Meanwhile, I’ve noticed through my own research that 4 other people have been promoted (it shows our title on our skype). She is now telling me she doesn’t know how far they can backdate it. I’ve been working overtime without that raise for 4 months straight. Now we are about to not have required overtime anymore, so I’m losing that money. 

I called HR myself to see what was up. They stated that the ball is in my boss’s court to handle this, so essentially everyone is pointing fingers at each other. My last email from my boss is from last week saying she hopes to get this resolved soon.

If you were claimed as a dependent in 2018 and you still haven't filed 2019, file 2019 ***immediately*** and write yourself as independent.  If your parents already filed and claimed you as a dependent, you can have their taxes amended/corrected to have you removed.

If you didn't file taxes in 2018, either because you didn't earn an income or you were underage, but did earn an income in 2019, ***file immediately***.  The stimulus bill will check 2019 wherever possible, but will revert to 2018 if nothing else.  If there's nothing on record, best case is your payment is delayed and you're waiting in queue with everyone else in the nation in the same predicament.  Worst case would be you may lose the payment altogether.

Anyone “out” there who can shed some light on this for those of us who thought 2020 was gonna be our year as employed folk?

I have been self-employed for all quarters that would count towards both my base period and alternate base period (ABP) if I were to file today (California). 

I became an actual employee of a company Feb 3, 2020 and have earned gross wages of $15K in Q1. My self-employed income is nowhere near this so I’m counting on these wages to determine my benefit. I was laid off on March 20th. Thought I’d really leveled up until COVID. Please can anyone help answer:

QUESTIONS

1) Is it in my (and anyone else’s) best interest to wait until after March 31 to file so ABP shifts into Q1 of this year and wages qualify for benefits? 

*2) Does the back dating to Sunday of week when claim was filed affect my base period? (i.e. If I file April 1, will they say my claim started on Sunday March 29 and disqualify Q1 from my base period?) 

3) Is there any harm in waiting until the following week to apply? (aside from forfeiting 2 weeks of benefits)

As her only other family member, I've been helping her as much as I could, sending money or paying for her expenses as soon as I started making enough money post graduate school around the time she started living alone. 

But she has always been irresponsible with her finances. I remember getting evicted 5+ times while growing up with her. When I came to visit her last week, she showed me an eviction letter crying her eyes out. Knowing she has nowhere else to go, I told her that I'll help her out and promised her landlord that I will repay whatever she owes. A few weeks prior to this, I gave her about half of my total savings to help her pay for an accident that she got into. And just yesterday, someone she had borrowed money from showed up in front of her apartment asking her to pay back and I ended up giving her the last of my savings... I'm in the midst of a transition into a new job. With no savings and my first two paychecks repaying her debt, I'm not even sure how I will be even be able to make my monthly payments.

I don't want cut ties with her although that thought crosses my mind every day now. I've explored all the ways to help her bring down her monthly cost. And she's on a wait list for a low-income apartment but who knows how long that will take. 

She's never been honest with me, especially with her finances. Whenever I would ask her how she's paying for rent in the past two years, she would get mad and hang up. I stopped giving her money and instead started paying for some of her expenses because I had zero trust in her that she was spending it on things like food and bills.

She can't hold a job given her illness nor can she even get a part time job with the current Covid-19 situation. I don't make enough to pay for all of her expenses and she really really lives beyond her means (Her monthly rent is almost $3k although she found someone to sublease the second bedroom. She's leasing a BMW with my name on the account and my credit score dropped 100 points after she missed her payments twice). Living together is not a likely option because I'm moving to a different city where the living cost there is too high for me to support two people. And, I just do not want to live with her again. I endured verbal and physical abuse as a child which I have come to accept and let go. I just don't want to be in that situation again and fall into depression.

I definitely don't want to get into debt to help her as I already have student loans to pay off. When I gave her the last of my savings, I broke down in front of her telling her that I'm not sure how I'm going to survive for the next month. I was shocked to get a blank stare back. Just the next day, she insisted on getting groceries herself and bought things that we really can't afford to eat right now. How is it that she doesn't get it? 

I'm really not sure what to do at this point. I'll be relocating for my new job in the next couple of weeks and I'll survive one way or another. But she's already late on her rent payment for March and April which means she'll be getting that eviction letter in just over a month time and I don't have it in me to want to help her out when she's been hurting me so much for so long.",49,1585379602,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqfege/im_going_broke_while_helping_my_sick_mom/,personalfinance,1
fqfa55,domokun3232,Initial Disclosure/Mortage Loan,"Hi all,  


First time posting on this sub and hopefully can get some advise from you fellas. So I'm first time home buyer and currently working on the loan process with 2 of the lenders. This is a new build so the builder would like me to use their prefer lender (Lets call this lender B). Unfortunately, I only qualify with FHA loan from lender B but I was qualify with conventional loan with another lender (Lets say lender A). I can put down 13-15% for the house so here're my questions/concerns.  


1. How can I find the current rates for my state (I'm from TX). Lender B offer interest 3.99 with 4.735 APR. And lender A offer 3.75 interest with no mention APR in paper. I know due to pandemic, FED is cutting the rate, so shouldn't the interest rate must be lower? I know that rates are based on a number of factors such as credit scores, loan to value, loan type, type of home, debt to income ratios and of course how the bond markets are performing at the time. But I was expecting to be much lower than what they offer.
2. Since I put down more than 10%, how can I remove the MIP if I choose lender B. And are the lenders would use the interest rate base on the initial closure or the new rate by the time that I'm ready to lock in. I just want to keep the rates low as possible.
3. I'm in a dilemma between 2 lenders. Lender B is good because they offer 6K on the closing cost but I just don't want the FHA. Lender A is with conventional (which I prefer) but they didn't offer anything much and their rate is the same when they provide me a initial fee worksheet 2 months ago (I have a pre-approval letter from them when I was first looking at older house, but now I change my mind and find new build home is better).  


 I know this is kind of long and a bit of confusing, but please advise. I really need some honest opinions from experience peeps so I can made a better decision or at least I can negotiate with them.

Here's a story for you. In 2018 I worked for like 5 different places including gig apps. Many of them never sent me a W2 or 1099, one lied and said I didn't pay any taxes off my check, and one literally didn't even report my income to the IRS (i think, but we'll get into that). I decided to take the place that cheated me as a loss. I just want these taxes done, my only worries are, WTF do I do about the place that didn't report my income? Because this is all so nuts I called the IRS and sent me this form with all my incomes on it, and that job just doesn't show up. I don't want to be on the hook for them lying. Beyond that, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to file taxes for 2018 at this point. The only form they gave me that they said I could use in place of w2s does not have an uncensored EINs or Names for any of the employers. I cant get on the IRS website for some reason to request documentation either. 

&amp;#x200B;

2019 again, like 6 places I worked including gigs. Received 2 w2s and thats it. I don't know what I need to do to get this done. I am so stressed. Ive waited for hours on hold to try to talk to the IRS and they don't ever tell me anything I can do. 

tl;dr I can't figure out how to file my taxes because of missing and incomplete info from 2018 and 2019",3,1585378872,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqf98d/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_about_my_weird_ass_tax/,personalfinance,1

fqf61r,therealaustrasia,My plan / Lending to family.,"Hello everyone, 

I was hoping to get some guidance on how to handle this issue. I am a 34 year old male with a decent job and salary for the next 4 years or so. (around 120k). My family is back in my country and I have been living abroad for a long time.

My mother (53) doesn’t work, she basically looks after my grandmother (92) and takes my younger sister (22) to the hospital and back, where she’s doing her residency year of medical school. (Due to safety reasons it's best not to use public transport back home, especially for younger girls). 

Their income comes from a rental property, which is enough for my grandmother, mother, sister and brother who is also a student to get by, but I know there are some essential things lacking, one being my mother having medical insurance (again, the public health system in my country is not the best). They live a decent life, but rarely go on vacation or splurge at all… 

The rental property the money comes from, as well as my grandmother’s apartment, each worth about 1M usd., will eventually be inherited by my mother, and she also owns the place where she and my younger sister currently live, worth around 70k. 

I know they are stressed about money sometimes, and I have helped occasionally by paying for some of my sister’s school expenses or by sending some cash, but I don’t really know how things are as she does not want me to worry about them.

To make the story short, I want my mother to have medical insurance, because if something ever happens, not having it would mean a pretty problem, and for her not to be stressed and start paying her credit card debt, which she wouldn't tell me how much it is, but I’m guessing somewhere around 5-6k.

I consulted with my older sister (who is independent and lives in the UK),  and mom, as I want to start sending some monthly money over, which I would get back once one of the properties are sold, or when both (current and grandmothers) are rented and the income comes only to my mother, but I want it to do it in a way in which I don’t run into any problems in the future. 

Here’s my very simple plan, and I hope I can get any feedback about the plan or situation if you have any.

* Start a shared (mother + 3 siblings) excel spreadsheet where I log what has been sent every month (including banking fees).
* The total amount will be subject to an interest rate matching Ally’s Online Banking (1.50%) 
* I get it back once there is a large sum of income, or the rent becomes enough for my mother to start paying back from it. 

I hope this was clear, and again, any feedback on these kinds of issues will be appreciated.",11,1585378418,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqf61r/my_plan_lending_to_family/,personalfinance,1

fqexca,SaintSignal,Old Debt Affecting Credit Score,"A few years ago, I was banking with a small, localized bank. Due to some lean times, my checking balance went into the red. The fees were roughly twenty dollars a day for each day that it had a negative balance (and you can see where this exacerbates the problem).

I opened an account with another bank who weren't going to be as extortionate, and decided as a matter of principal that I wasn't going to pay back Bank A the mammoth levels of fees they put on me, and they had closed the account shortly afterwards.

Probably realizing they weren't going to see any of the $1,000 of fees, they sent the debt to a collections agency which has been half-heartedly trying to contact me on and off for the past two years or so, but nothing I would call a real effort.

Recently I've noticed a dramatic drop on one of my credit scores, which roughly corresponded to a letter I had received from the collections agency, on again asking for the money. Now, I may be mistaken, but I believe the collection agency may be a part of that.

Is there anything I can do to dispute this? Fight it? Should I just bite the bullet and make arrangements to pay up? My main concern is getting my credit back to better shape.",5,1585377197,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fqexca/old_debt_affecting_credit_score/,personalfinance,1

So I'm really stumped on my tax situation, as I have been hearing a bunch of different answers and I would really like to clear it up. Since I was born, my grandmother has been putting away money for me in Series EE bonds, so she was saving from approx. 1998 until 2007. When I got into college, she told me that her personal accountant told her that the interest on the bonds would be tax exempt as long as they were used for tuition/fees. 

I completely forgot to file my 2018 taxes with the 1099-INT form and went to have them amended with HR Block a few weeks ago, but they told me that since I cashed the bonds before I was 24 (I've cashed them between the ages of 19 and 22), I would have to pay interest even though they were used for tuition. He said that my parents HAVE to claim the education credit (even though they didn't contribute for my school expenses at all) and since the bonds were only in my name OR my grandmother's name, I had to claim them and the IRS doesn't recognize that as being tax exempt. Apparently the guy at HR block told my parents something else completely different from all of this.

If we'd have known this would be the case, we would've just paid out of pocket for the tuition expenses and left the bonds to mature fully. I got a letter from the IRS stating that I owed them money from this, but I would really like to clear up if this is a misunderstanding.

I am interested in purchasing this car exclusively. 

I have saved up the required cash to purchase the car for its residual value. As you can imagine, this is a non-trivial amount of money. I am generally emotionally averse to debt so I prefer the idea of paying for my car with cash over taking out a loan. However, I recognize that this might be the most efficient use of my money. 

Until now I was content with the potential market losses for buying the car with cash. However, with the recent market downturn I've began to entertain the idea of investing this money into an index fund and taking out an automotive loan through my credit union to pay for the car instead. This has the added benefit of allowing me to keep additional money around in a semi-liquid form in case things get really bad. However, I expect my current emergency fund to be able to carry me for about 4-6 months so this is not necessarily that important.

I've been contacted by my grandmothers financial advisors, who seems to have my best interest at hand (but don't they all?). I guess my best question is, what is my next best move?

fqea56,gabdoll,Buying a home out of state - primary versus secondary residence,"Me and my husband currently live and work in California. In order to own a home here, we would have to live at least an hour commute away just to pay 450k-500k for a 3bed family home (homes in our city usually cost 700k+). 

It's our dream to own a house, so we are buying in Nevada. Our plan is to transfer our jobs there but we can't do that right at this very moment, especially with everything happening in the world currently. But we can't get a mortgage without jobs near our primary residence.

Is it possible to finance the home as a second home and live in that home for the majority of the year once we can move our jobs while putting a family home in California as our primary residence?

fqe5na,outskirtsofparadise,Question re: dividend taxes,"I'm trying to understand what my estimated taxes owed for this quarter.  I'd like to know  how taxes on dividends work.  Let's say I own stock in Company A and I bought one lot over a year ago (Qualified) and I bought a second lot a few months ago (Non-qualified).  The company decides to pay a dividend and since both lots were in possession before the ex-date, I receive  the dividend payment.  My question is this: Does the IRS tax me differently based on the fact I've owned the second lot less than a year ( as a non-qualified dividend)?

I ask because Fidelity doesn't break it out that way on their Tax Information section of their site.  It shows all as Qualified Dividends received this Quarter.  I just want to confirm that I can trust this information and not get dinged for underpayment.

I have been working as a design engineer since June. I absolutely hate it and have no desire to continue being an engineer. I hated it in school &amp; stuck it out, and now I feel like I’m wasting my days hating what I do. 

Our current remaining debts:

His college - $80k
Our house - $150k

That’s really it for debts. We pay off credit cards immediately and both our cars are paid off. Our mortgage is $1250 a month but I’ve been paying in more at $2000 a month (I pay mortgage and bills &amp; he pays his college and insurance &amp; things like that, we don’t currently share finances). I don’t have any college debt or anything.

My husband makes around $120k a year but after he’s done traveling for work in 2 years, it will drop to $75k. I make $57k currently.

If I take the new job I want, I would make roughly $40-$45k. My husband thinks this will hurt us financially because he really enjoys financial freedom &amp; has some expensive hobbies. Don’t get me wrong, I like buying myself something every once and a while, but I’m definitely the more frugal one. 

We don’t plan on having kids for about 3-4 years from now. 

Am I selfish for wanting to take a pay cut? Is it financially irresponsible for my marriage? My husband supports me quitting my current job because I’m unhappy with it but insists I should stay in the engineering field and find a job with a similar salary.

fqcge7,Gabstopit,Parents threatening to cut me off financially,"(Skip to the asterisks if you don’t want to read the backstory.)
I turned 18 a few months ago, and with that have taken some steps to allow myself more privacy.  I love my parents.  I really do.  But growing up, they were physically and emotionally abusive.  The physical stuff has stopped.  But the emotional abuse is still there.  I think they’re trying to be better.  But if I do something they don’t like, the name calling and the threats and putting me down all comes back.
I’m also type 1 diabetic, and of course as a child they had to take care of me.  As I’ve gotten older though, this has become entirely my responsibility.  Mainly because there came a point where they were extremely overbearing.  If my A1C didn’t go down enough from the last doctor’s visit, then they’d cut my carbs and I’d get less food (only carbless stuff).  They’d make me run on the treadmill.  There was a point where they were convinced I was “huge” and kept saying I’m fat (I’m at a healthy weight, I’m also an athlete and tend to gain when I’m more active due to muscle.)  They would get mad if I ate anything with no carbs now.  Cheese had too much fat.  Ham had too much fat.  I couldn’t even eat too much fruit because it was too much sugar.  So when I turned 18, I cut their access to my medical records.  I wanted to be able to treat and manage my illness in my own without the added stress of feeling like my health was a daily exam.  My doctor supported this.
Recently, I also went to the police station with a friend to report an abusive ex who was stalking me.  I didn’t have enough evidence yet to get a restraining order, but the university I attend now has it on record at least.  My mom called me while I was waiting at the station and I told her where I was and what I was doing.  I came home to be screamed at for hours by my parents and oldest brother for not telling them, because they thought I shouldn’t have tried in the first place and that I needed their guidance.
Today, I got some new medical supplies, which has a follower option that would allow them to see my blood glucose throughout the day.  I wanted to figure out how to limit this to only emergencies, and so when my parents kept pressing me to give them access I told them not yet and that I need to figure out how to make it for only certain times because I don’t want them to have constant access to my glucose levels (hence bringing back the issues I dealt with before.)  Then of course the yelling comes next.

**

Basically, my situation now is that they no longer are paying for the medical supplies I need to stay alive.  They told me unless I stop “disrespecting” them that I’ll be cut off entirely financially.  I need to get a job with insurance that covers my insulin and med supplies.  If I do what they say, I don’t think I’m going to be able to handle it and I’ll probably attempt to end my life again.  I want to be happy.  I know my parents are no longer obligated to care for me or provide financial support, so please, no need to tell me again.  I have scholarships paying about 70% of my college tuition, but I can audition for more.  My friend told me to post here to ask for advice, so I figured I’d try.

fqcend,AudgieD,Bank account questions... Should we move banks? Where should we park our emergency fund? How should we best save for our kids’ futures?,"We did FPU with our church last fall and we’re approaching the end of Baby Step 2... just $9k left on the car.  There are several things that we learned we’re probably not doing in the most optimal way regarding bank accounts.  I’m hoping to gain some wisdom here.

First, I’m wondering if we should change banks.  I’ve been with Capital One for almost 20 years.  When we married, I added my husband on that checking account.  We have an emergency fund in a money market account that gets almost no interest at all.  A few pennies per month.  We also have two 360 savings accounts, one for each of our girls (4 y/o and 11 m/o).  Those also get almost no interest.  (Forgive my ignorance, but before Dave Ramsey, I didn’t know about how we should be investing the kids’ money, not just saving it.)

My concern with Capital One is I don’t feel like we benefit at all from this banking relationship.  I hear people tout the benefits of credit unions, but I don’t know much about them.  It seems like most of the ones around here (Louisiana) are exclusive ( have to be a fireman, Navy, school board employee, etc). For as long as I’ve been a customer at Capital one, my money market rate has only ever dropped.  It was 5% when I first opened that account back in college (2007).

FPU also taught us a little about the different kinds of account options for investing for children.  ESAs and 529s.  What’s the best way to go?  What if one or both of them don’t go to college?  I don’t even know if capital one has those kinds of accounts.  Or does that even matter?  For simplicity’s sake, I’ve always liked having all accounts with one entity, but I don’t know if that’s smart or silly.

So, to summarize, as we work on getting more financially savvy...

1.  Should we establish with a different bank?
2.  What’s the best kind of account to use for our emergency fund?  Do other banks have higher rates?
3.  How do you decide which kind of investment accounts are the best option for your children?

fqcec0,datgurlb,What’s the best option for me with my car?,"Okay, I am coming to you reddit because my parents aren’t amazing at finances and well in my younger years, neither was I and I am trying to get a hold of it and get on track.

I bought my car, a 2015 Used Nissan Rogue AWD in 2016 by myself and signed into a pretty bad deal. 

I currently owe $13.7k on it and pay $455 a month on it. My interest is at 8.9%. I have 75k miles on it. 
I can currently afford this, but if I could have a lower payment I could start to pay off other debts and save more than I currently am.

Few choices I have looked into, I tried to post it on Craigslist and I got no bites on it. There is some superficial damage (scratches and small dents) on one side. (An automatic closing gate closed on my car) 

What do you think my best option is? 

Should I refinance? 
Should I file an insurance claim and get the side fixed and then try to sell it?
Should I try and trade it in? 
Should I wait until car sales are desperate to get cars off their lot and trade in then? What’s the outlook for car sales with this movement in the economy? 
Should I just wait the remaining 2 years and just pay it off?

Some info you should know, I don’t have good credit (from my younger ignorant years). But I do have someone with excellent credit who is willing to co-sign for me. 
I genuinely have no idea what the best option is for me. Maybe there are some people with experience that could help?

fqcc5u,leighton021,Need to revise my budget,"I’m 32(f) and new to budgeting. My husband and I have always just made it work. But eventually after looking at peers, etcI felt our money could be going further and we were likely throwing it away somewhere, so 6-9 months ago I finally made a budget. It combines a few of the more popular methods. We are married homeowners with 1 toddler and 1 on the way and both work full time from home. I am on a standard salary structure. But husband is in sales and has a base salary equal to my annual, plus commission (which ultimately ends up doubling+ his yearly, but of course each month can vary greatly). Our debt includes our mortgage, 1 car loan for a small sedan, and 1 personal loan we used to combine a few other debts into a single payment. If we aren’t hit too badly financially as a result of covid-19, I anticipate having the personal loan paid off this year. And to use the snowball method to get rid of the car loan (and save for a new one) shortly after. 

The overall budget has the general goal of a 80/20 split which I picked just as a starting point because I knew we weren’t going to be hitting it at first. I also utilize the 0 method just in that I try to assign every dollar to go somewhere. We’re loosely following Dave Ramsey’s baby steps. We had over $1k saved time begin with and began tackling debt. However, we just got our tax refund and while it could’ve been used to wipe out the personal loan (higher interest AND balance), my husband convinced me to save it so we could have something substantial saved just in case. Low and behold a pandemic hits a few weeks later. I’m on furlough right now. So thank goodness I didn’t throw it all on the loan (although we’d have an extra 400/mo if I had).

Anyway, I set up the budget into 4 categories. Bills, Spending, Short Term Savings (things like purchases for our home, Xmas gifts, vacations), and Long Term Savings. After calculating what the amount was for each category, I divided it into 4 (for our 4 total paychecks/month). So each payday, I transfer that 25% amount into each category and have separate accounts for each category.

The issue is the disparity of our paychecks. For even numbers sake, let’s say we make $10k/month total (we don’t, but on a really good commission month it’s possible lol). But our paychecks aren’t an even amount. My husband gets paid bi/weekly (26 checks/year). He gets commission on the last check of the month. So his first check is just his base salary. The second is base salary plus commission from the month prior. Since I’m on a standard semi-monthly structure (24 checks/year) all of my checks are the same, and even though my salary is the same as my husbands base, we have insurance through my job, so my take home amount is significantly less. Therefore, of the 10k, the checks might look like this

me: $1500
Him: $2000
Me; $1500
Him: $5000

So what I’m finding is that since I’ve split up each of our spending/savings evenly, I end up needing to transfer from savings to spending for 3 weeks, and then when we get the commission check at the end of the month, I’m able to catch up and pay all the accounts back, etc. So in the end, we’re not in any worse shape, but I’d much rather not be transferring from savings all month just to make it to our “big” check to get caught up.

So I need to figure out a better method of transferring money on payday, to use different ratios. Of course in the example above, since the commission check is 50% of our monthly income, I should be using that to fund 50% of the budget rather than 25% from each of the 4 checks. But since that number can vary greatly, it just feels impossible to land on the right amount. It might be 3000 for a few months in a row and then be 8000 once. 

I’m really a person who runs best with structure, which is why I’m the right person to manage our money and keep us on a budget, but for that same reason, a variable income makes my head explode haha.

Do I take out a personal loan for the remaining amount and buy an inexpensive vehicle? Or do I keep my vehicle, continuing making the payments and any maintenance it requires along the way?

fqbpg5,weissguy3,How to suspend IRS direct debit payment plan,"Part of the IRS's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been to suspend payment plans until 7/15. 

&gt; Existing Installment Agreements –For taxpayers under an existing Installment Agreement, payments due between April 1 and July 15, 2020 are suspended. Taxpayers who are currently unable to comply with the terms of an Installment Payment Agreement, including a Direct Debit Installment Agreement, may suspend payments during this period if they prefer. Furthermore, the IRS will not default any Installment Agreements during this period. By law, interest will continue to accrue on any unpaid balances.

The trouble is that if you are signed up for a direct debit payment plan, you have to suspend the scheduled payments yourself. I have not found a way to do this. 

I have logged on to IRS.gov and gone to the payment plan, only to be greeted by an error message when I try to change the amount or payment date.

I have also tried calling the IRS at 800-829-1040 and each time after going through all the menus, there is a message saying that due to a very high call volume, they are not taking any additional calls at this time, at which point I am hung up on.

During the winter quarter I had quite a hit to my mental health. I needed to stop and reassess myself and get some serious counseling and a bit of medication. I dropped my classes and planned to resume schooling in the Spring for my last quarter. All of my schooling was being paid for through financial aid such as grants and federal loans. 

When I dropped my classes I ended up going below a class credit limit that I did not know about. Because of this, all my my financial aid fell through and my spring classes have been dropped due to non-payment.

I have been attempting to contact anyone at the school for advice and help but there’s not much in the field of counseling being offered right now due to COVID-19. A “financial expert” from the school just gave me some links to financial aid and places to get another loan.

I now have a bill in hand from UCDavis for around 7000.00 dollars that I must pay by April 15. If I were to pay for this I would need to muster another 5000.00 for the spring quarter tuition fees. One of the main reasons why I attended UCDavis is because they were giving me such great financial aid that most of my schooling was paid for. And now I’m being left high and dry.

To make matters worse, my wife and I have no work because our jobs are school related and hourly. I just don’t know what to do. Should I take out a ~20000.00 loan in order to stay afloat and get my last quarter done now, or apply for more financial aid and take the last quarter in the fall?

I'm looking to clear out \~25k of long term debt at between 5-6% percent. I have a few ways I could address this, and I'm looking for some advice on best path forward.

I can wait for my ESPP to purchase (June) and sell those shares, netting me 6k at current stock prices. Gross would be \~24k.

I could exercise options using sell-to-cover and then sell enough to pay off the debt, about 1/3 of my currently vested options at current stock price.

I could sell the RSUs I was granted last week. Grant price on the RSUs is about 4x the strike price of the options, and some RSUs were automatically sold at market price to cover taxes.

His boss says that they are an ""essential business"" because they provide self-service auto parts.  (even know you can also buy the same parts online)  

My dad is at high-risk for severe illness from COVID-19 for two reasons....He is ""65 years and older"" (69), and he is also immunocompromised.  He lives with my elderly mother who also meets the same criteria. 

So, he made the decision to stay home in order to protect himself and his family.

I got a job in which I was expected to travel within the city. I have a friend who deals in cars and I trusted him to pick one for me. He suggested a Ford Fusion Hybrid 2016 which cost me a total of $22k CAD. I got it on a 6 year finance with $352/ month. 
The car is great, but I don’t know if that was a wise decision. The monthly cost of my car and rent makes 60% of my monthly income. 
I like the independence I get with owning a car but the thought of not thinking it through is troubling me. I need your suggestions if:
1. I made the right decision
2. Should I sell it and get a cheaper car? If yes, how can I get the best value.

No 401k.  Because it's awful 

Currently have a roth and a traditional ira rolled over from previous employer 

Cant drive so I commute to work (though with the virus my work is now mostly remote) but that's that biggest dent in my pocket costing me 100 a day to go and come back from work. 

Due to my commuting I have to live with my parents. Though I am not a fan I dont have a choice at the moment.  Also they scammed out of 7k  by promising to help me drive so I bought a car in Hope's they will teach me but they ended up writing the title of the vehicle under their name without my knowledge. Now they refuse to help. Now it's me to buy a house just so they can move in and kick me out saying it's an investment in my end( I'm not even exaggerating the slightest)  

I have 2 ira.  A roth and a traditional rolled over from a previous employee (which is another long story but unrelated to the subreddit)  my goal is to contribute 200 a month on each.  

Try to put in a few hundred into a Money market savings from time to time compounding with a daily interest of .70

My hope is me transition from a contractor to working at the company and hopefully get higher pay. If not due to the reputation of the company I'm sure it might not be too hard.

Roth TSP: Contributing 15% with 6% government matching. (These contributions are small, as they are reserve paychecks for one weekend a month).  (6k balance)

Out of nowhere the company sent me a notice of judgment to pay in full and now my potential lender want me to produce a proof of lien payment. This is not even ""truly"" my debt. My ex opened the account and apparently stopped paying it. When I found out about it, I was advised that it will fall off after 7 years and not worry about it.

And now it's back and I have no reserve to pay that $4500 and produce a proof of lien payment. My estimated closing date is 4/9. Is this gonna make the sale fall thru?

&amp;#x200B;

Bought a 2018 Mazda 3 in early 2018. Still owed about 4k on my trade in. Total price after tax, fees etc was about 24k. Currently owe about 20,100 left. 10.50% interest rate. Very bad and stupid of me to sign that, I know. At the time, I had a good job and was going to pick up hours to refinance and pay it off quickly. I quit my job. At the time I thought it was a good decision to do a different type of work. Would take way too long to explain. I fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm paying $481/mo for this car. With what's going on, I feel the need to have some form of transportation. If it weren't for COVID-19, I'd have more than likely been selected for a good paying job but they are holding off on recruitment and will get more info on April 6th as to what they will do. I really feel confident about it and I think I did well in the interview.

ANYWAY, this payment is killing me. If shit gets worse, I don't want to be spending 481/mo on a car. I've already asked my bank to defer 1 payment last October and I can only defer once per year. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question:** Should I save $500-$750 for a down payment on a cheap used car and try to get a payment of $130 or less per month? My plan would be to get a good used car, and just stop paying my 2018 Mazda 3 entirely. I don't care if the bank takes it. I know I'll still owe that money. They'll just have to deal with it for the time being as far as I'm concerned. Then, save the money I'd be saving (hopefully at least $330 per month) for things like rent and utilities until this COVID-19 passes, which at this point is still at a ""who knows"" kind of situation.

&amp;#x200B;

My current line of work is delivering food on Door Dash. The pay seems better as of right now. Less drivers, and people tipping slightly more etc. But I'm genuinely afraid of leaving my apartment. I'd like to minimize that as much as possible.

fqa0g4,Geiger17,"Continue saving for house, or invest?","I should probably start this off with some qualifiers.

* I am a single person that has about $70k in retirement and my salary is around $100k.
* I am maxing out all tax advantaged accounts at my disposal (401k, Vanguard IRA, &amp; HSA)
* I have about $20k saved up for an eventual home purchase, and continuing to rapidly save more.
* But I don't mind renting, as I get to stay mobile. 
* I have a 6-month emergency fund not included in the above figures, because of course.

I have been considering purchasing/living in/renting out a Duplex in the next 1-2 of years, but with the recent economic downturn I'm considering other options.

I do not direly care to own a home, it just seemed like a good(ish) financial decision. Given the current status of the market, would it be smart in the medium-long term to pour the money I'm saving for a home instead into the markets. I understand that we can possibly see more downside to this, so it wouldn't be a dump all at once.

My endgame is to potentially cash this invested money out after the economy recovers in order to buy a home or pursue other investments. With that said, I might just leave it in.

I spend about $1,200/mo primarily on food to live while at college. I am living with my parents again for the time being as the campus has shut down, but my parents have been claiming me as a dependent the entire time.

The issue is that I would really like to claim a stimulus check for myself, but I do not think I will qualify since my parents are claiming me as a dependent. I do not file my taxes personally, but could if I wanted to. They refuse to stop claiming me as a dependent even though they have not helped pay for my day-to-day living since mid-2019.

The coronavirus outbreak has severely hurt my income currently as my business does brand design for other businesses. With non-essential business financially damaged, my clients are not spending any money on design. My revenue stream has almost dried up compeletely. I think it is only fair for me to be able to claim this stimulus check, but I am not sure if I will be able to considering my parents have claimed me as a dependent on their most recent tax return.

Is there anything I can do to make sure that I qualify for the check?

I’m really torn between these two schools - it’d mean a lot if you guys could help me make a decision:


Indiana University (Kelley):

PROS: #9 ranked finance undergrad, top 10 business school, beautiful campus, great social scene, lots to do and very helpful in terms of academic advising, will help me get recruited at top firms, etc., got into Hutton Honors and got 12K off per year.
CONS: Still 40k per year


Temple University (Fox):

PROS: Got into Fox Honors (very selective, only ~60 kids in class, will give me exclusive internships to pursue + priority reg. and all that), only around 14K per year, still a nice campus, decent social scene, and it’s in the city so I’ll be able to make lots of connections within the city 
CONS: Around the 60-70th ranked undergrad business school. Doesn’t have the name brand of Indiana.


How much will going to a better school in IU make a difference than going to Temple? My parents say they can “afford anything” but I feel like they aren’t being fully transparent. It’s also going to save them money if I go to Temple and my sis (9th grade) has to go to college too. Est. family annual income = ~150k.

fq97id,ElectricOne55,Best financial option for returning college student/career changer," I'm wanting to switch careers to IT from firefighting. I have an A+ and Net+ certification. I'm debating whether to go back to college, and I'm deciding between WGU online which would cost around $10000 or so, or the local state school close to me which would be $20000 and 5 to 6 semesters.I talked with my gf and she suggested in person would be better just to meet people, have something to do, and ask professor questions. It is double the cost though and I can't accelerate. My parents suggested I should just stay in the fire department because it pays 40k and the benefits aren't bad, but we do 70 to hours a week and make around 40k, and I don't really like the area I live in and want to move one day. We also do manadatory overtime where sometimes we have to do 2 24hr shifts in a row then have one day off then go in for another 24 hour shifts. 

 I also thought of applying to jobs in other cities if I were to do WGU as a third option; however, I don't even know if that's possible with all this going on. However, if I did go to the in person school I would have to work a part time job that pays 1/4 of what I'm making now or go 2 years without working.

So which of these options would be best

1. stay at current job
2. Go to WGU while staying in Fire dept
3. get another part time job and go to the in person state school

fq90lo,__plankton__,Confused about which states I should be filing taxes in,"Hi yall,

As stated in the title, I'm confused about which states I should file my taxes in, and am hoping for advice.

A couple notes about this year for me:

* I worked and earned income in MA for 7 months of the year
* I quit my job and moved to NH to attend graduate school for the remainder of the year. I live in a dorm. 
* I changed my bank account addresses, etc. to PA, where my mom lives, as this was a more permanent address
* MA was the only state that I earned income in

Questions:

* Does this mean I ""moved"" to PA, or NH?
* PA taxes out of state income--would it be wiser to say I moved to NH?

What I like to do is run through our budget for 3-4 months once in a while and make sure we of course never get too low on money but also if I can take any out to put in our savings account.

I also posted this to legal advice.

I know this is a wage claim process, but I'm having a hard time finding the appropriate...forms? for such a claim. I'm sorry if this should be obvious ~.~

So the last day I worked was 2/04 of this year, and as far as I know I was officially terminated a couple days later? I was never actually told by my employer that I was fired, I had to get my union rep to squeeze the info out of them. Also, the position was not one where I worked at a physical location. I drove for a living, transporting crews, so where I would pick up a van would be at a rail yard where my supervisor had an office, but that was about it. Any dealings I had with my manager would be over the phone, so everything was pretty much hands free, so to speak. I'm assuming that if I was properly paid my last check, I would have received it direct deposit. Considering that I was paid the way I was normally paid two weeks later, they likely had no ""last check"" prepared for me, sitting in my supervisors office that I just never picked up either.

As for PTO, as I said I have not gotten anything for it. I have proof of how many hours I am owed.

I know 100% I'm owed for not getting my last paycheck in a timely manner, but my question is...they owe me compensation for every day they have not paid out my PTO for up to 30 days, right? Do I have that right? And are those business days?

Lastly...I can't afford a lawyer. I'm still in the appeal process of getting unemployment and I'm broke :/ but it seems pretty cut and dry to me, so I should be ok without one...yeah? Maybe? D:

I have a 6 year old daughter and am married, but not to my daughter’s mom.

We had a custody agreement for the last 5 years that named my daughter’s mom the primary conservator, but in August of 2019 I won a court case that basically swapped custody, so that as of August 2019 I am the primary conservator and my daughter’s mom only gets her 2 weekends per month and my daughter is with me for the rest of the time.

I had to wait to file taxes until a little later this year because my wife had a student loan in default and we were waiting until we completed the rehab program to get it out of default. As a result we just filed our taxes this afternoon and my return was rejected because, as I expected, my daughter’s mom already filed her taxes and claimed my daughter on her taxes.

I have done some research online and it looks like I now need to file a paper return and submit proof of our custody agreement and then the IRS will accept my tax return and audit my wife’s mother since I now have custody of my daughter and my daughter’s mom only has visitation rights.

I just want to make sure that I am on the right track and I’m not wasting time and effort by submitting a mail return that will still end up with my daughter’s mom getting to claim her on her taxes.

Am I correct?

fq7i4j,CAP034,Feeing pretty helpless right about now. I have no way if receiving my tax return after moving bases.,"I filed my taxes through TurboTax in early February, expecting a return of around 1100. I’ve needed that money for a minute. Almost a month had past before I finally saw that there was some error with my direct deposit and they had mailed a check to me instead. 

Now, i’m in the military. I had already PCSd to a new base and had no way of receiving that check. I was able to get a buddy to talk to that post office and they said they would forward it to my new address. That was a week and a half ago. I am in the same state as my last base, just a few hundred miles away so it should have gotten here by now.

I called the IRS today to try and update my direct deposit to try and have the tax return redeposited and also so that whatever was wrong with it is fixed before the IRS trys sending out the stimulus payment to all citizens. I got ahold of a representative and they told me nothing could be done because their customer support is down until further notice. Feeling pretty helpless right about now.

My husband and I are looking to buy our first home within the next 4-5 months. We currently have \~20k saved for a down payment and are quickly paying off our credit cards. 

My credit isn't great and it keeps fluctuating. It ranges from 611-689 depending on what credit score you are looking at. It was starting to increase as my debt was decreasing but then my transunion score tanked (for no reason I can find out). 

His credit score is slowly increasing as well and is around 680-690. 

Anyways, we have a good bit of student loan debt but are currently not having to pay on them for another 2 years. Our monthly gross income is around 5k. 

I'm beginning to get really worried that we won't be approved for a house even though we can 100% afford it.

The first one went through for $6492. The second charge was $7244 but the credit card declined that one. The next day, when I used my card, it was declined so I called, learned of the problem, and canceled my card.

They removed the charge for a week, but it has re-appeared on my statement. They say that since the chip was used, the card is in my possession, therefore I made the charge and I am liable.

At the time of the charges, I was at work. I 100% DID NOT do this. It was apparently for industrial hair products (either industrial machines or expensive hair treatments?). The only information we have is that it was spent at an unlisted place called ""Professional Hair Dr L Chicago Illinois.""

So, either my card has been cloned (which the credit card company says is impossible) or someone literally stole my card, used it, and put it back. I cannot pay $6500 of credit card fraud. I have filed a police report. 

In 20 years of having this card, I have never engaged in fraudulent activity. I have never charged thousands of dollars within a month. I have a credit score above 800. Is there anything I can do to prove to them that this is fraud, and not me trying to get something for free?

I’m very lucky in the way that my parents pay for my university fees, accommodation, and my necessities. The money I save comes from the part time job i work (125$ a month, it’s on a basis of when i’m needed, which isn’t very often so I don’t get paid an awful lot) and hopefully from the full time job i’ll get over summer where I’d hopefully early above 2000$ over the 3 month period. 

A issue I’ve been facing recently is I put away 100% of what I earn into my savings, and I feel this will cause me to burnout soon because I’m working and as soon as I get the money, it’s gone into a savings account. I feel bad spending any large amount of money as I feel they’d be much better off to my future goals. I told myself that once i saved about $400, I’d allow myself to spend about $50 but I feel bad doing it.

I decided to just check my school finances today just on a whim and now it says I’m $536 overdue! This is after paying $300 already and my pell grant. Apparently they pushed the refund so I could get my transcripts released without mentioning that would take away from my registration fees.

I don’t fault them maybe miscommunication but now I owe them $536.
I am actually at a good financial point when it comes to any debt and bills (I am catching up on my credit card and paying off other stuff). But if I pay this I’m going to max out my credit card and my regular bank account. Put me at $0 till I get paid and I hate the idea of having to max out my credit card again and having no money. On top of that my registration fee for my car is due $181 so I’m actually looking at $717. I doubt even have enough to cover both. 
I’m debating trying to take out a small loan (~$300) to help pay for the $536 but I don’t want to get caught up in a pay day type loan situation where I end up even further in debt. Any suggestions? Should I just take the L and just pay off my school and max out my credit card and just start from $0 and then push my registration off even I get penalized?

fq5d23,3v01,Is buying a house a good or bad idea right now?,"Hello PF,

To lay out my scenario here, I am graduating college in May. I have a job in western Ohio. I will be making 72k per year (this is still guaranteed by my employer, they are still working and will continue with what has been happening), this is about 1.5x the average for the area. 

As I have been looking at places to live I have noticed that houses are pretty cheap. For what I want in a house it looks like the rent will be somewhere around 1200-1600 depending on what concessions I make (I am looking at fairly new/nice 2-3 bed houses with attached garages). While looking I have noticed that I can buy about the same level of house for around $160k. This would put my mortgage at around $1200 and I would not be throwing away money to rent. I also would love to have a house that I can work on, paint, update things ect.

I am curious what you guys think about this. I currently owe some money on a car that I own (about 20k) and also will have about 28k in student loan debt. This is the reason that I think I should probably not purchase a house, however I do plan to pay off both of these in the next 2 years (my budget has me putting $2000-$2500/mo to one or both of these (this includes my minimum car payment)), I have another car that I own outright that is worth about 23k and selling that has come across my mind, it holds quite a bit of sentimental value to me. I will also have about 11k in savings when I graduate.

Given the current economic climate is now a bad time to buy a house? Am I rushing into buying a house? My credit score is around 750 right now, my parents have said they would cosign the mortgage for me if that's possible. 

I really don't know what I am doing but am excited to learn and to figure out what is best for me.

fq56st,AGatorInUpstateNY,"Are my wife and I being shafted by these ""rates""?","My wife and I currently pay month to month rent on a house owned by her mother and stepfather. And they are willing to offer a land contract in the style of a mortgage. They claimed to put info into a mortgage calculator and gave us a few different options.
The first was a 20 year @ 710.97/month with 8% interest and option two was a 30 year @ 623.70/month with the same interest.
My wifes' mother never gave a definitive total price on what they're selling the house for but if I recall correctly they previously mentioned 80k.

My concern is, a quick Zillow search shows they bought the house in 2017 at only 54k and the only additions they added were some porches and an auto shop with a industrial car lift. Does that seem like those additions would equate to selling it to us at 80k with an 8% interest?

With the interest over 20-30 years we're looking at easily almost 200k when all is said an done if I'm not mistaken?

Nothing has been set in stone or signed yet, but I just want to see if anyone can sort of guide on whether or not they're taking advantage of us by acting like they're doing us a favor by setting up a land contract. Our credit scores are incapable of qualifying for loans or mortgages through actual banks and finding places to rent when we have several pets is a real issue so being in this house helps but I feel like they're way over pricing and trying to make us pay much more than what the house may be worth.

fq54t3,ningersplugby,"ETS (GRE testing) approved a chargeback and then proceeded to charge me a $20 fee on top of what I ""owed""","Last December, like any grad student, I sent my GRE scores to colleges, but one in particular did not receive my scores. I reached out to the program director and she was kind enough to log in on her end, and confirmed, yup, she could not find my name or number in the system. I called ETS to let them know, and ask what could be done. In a very roundabout way they told me they could do nothing, even though I very nicely asked if they could just see if there was a technical issue on their end, or may I talk to someone higher up. Customer rep said if the college is experiencing issues on their end that I should ask the college to contact them - even though I was very clear in explaining that the issue is only with the one applicant: ME. I have email proof and everything.

I decided to call my bank to do a chargeback instead since ETS was of no help. 

Fast forward to today where I received an email saying I have an outstanding balance with ETS, and they have withheld all services and scores. I log in to see that not only have they charged me again for the service they failed to provide, they added a $20 ""chargeback fee"" on top of that. I have called ETS again and they were as helpful as a brick wall. I have never come across a business that charges a chargeback fee. One or the other fee I could probably understand, but now the amount I ""owe"" is way more than the original service provided. I also told them they could have refuted the chargeback, because my bank was very clear that merchants can do that and it's not an automatic approval. The customer rep initially tried to lie to me and said they were not contacted, until I told her in no uncertain terms am I an idiot, and she finally acknowledged that she sees the record of a chargeback requested, but ETS ""automatically approved"" it, and their policy is once that goes through, a fee is charged.

My question is: If I do not pay them, and they have a credit card on file, will this be used against me? The information they have as a test taker does not include my ssn, so I'm not worried about that. Any ideas if this will go to collections?

TLDR: ETS charged a chargeback fee on top of my original service charges and have now withheld services, what should I worry about if I do not pay?

fq4u6l,nonstopski,Sitting on 1700 Vested RSUs in my Company.,"I have been receiving vested RSUs every year as part of my compensation for 4 years. This year, I actually got 2 dumps of them. I typically have been selling right wheen they vest (if its not a blackout period in my company). Unfortunately the blackout period ended right when COVID was just hitting the states. And we know how this went from there. 

I just received a promotion, so I plan on staying with the company and hoping to ride this out a bit longer. Our stock was averaging almost double what it is now and was fairly consistently at that number quarter over quarter. While I don't care to ""time the market"" if I sell now I would be selling at a fairly low lows (or close to it) and would rather wait. It games out to about a $18,000 - $30,000 difference between our average stock price in '19 and most of '20 vs now.

fq4twk,architecture13,Script for calling your credit card company if your economic status has now changed,"As we all face changes to the economy as a result of the global pandemic, now is the time to reach out and ask for help with your debt companies. 

Many like to wait till things get tight, and there is a logic about keeping “bad marks or comments” off your internal files or credit files. But if you wait, you will be more panicked/stressed and probably not think as clearly. 

Better to prepare now. For me we found out my white collar job was reducing hours to 28 per week for full time employees, with the appurtenant pay adjustment to our salary. So today before working from home I logged on and started calling my debtors; 

The script I prepared to use was generic but direct

“Hello, I am contacting you to ask about waiving current period interest and extending due dates on my account due to a change in my employment status.”

It does not elaborate what the change was, or give away excess information. Make the company ask you questions and treat it like your answering in court. Don’t embellish or pontificate. Assume the remaining staff working with you are taking copious notes. 

I discovered quickly that even at 8am phone lines are overwhelmed. Where possible I recommend you utilize customer service chat dialogue and screenshot the results for record. 

That script worked to get interest waived at Citibank for this month, and a note to ask again in 30 days if still having financial difficulties. 

Chat was down at Capitalone, so i called. They directly ask you if you have enough in checking or savings to pay the coming bill. If you have your high yield savings there, you are SOL as I was. I was told to call back when I depleted my cash reserves. I will try again via chat this evening. 

Next I’ll try it on Synchrony/Care Credit and update the post with this results. 

Sidenote;
I also tried the “utility” companies with the following results. 

AT&amp;T - Will not reduce bills. BUT will waive lates fees or data overages on internet and mobile phone plans during the next 60 days. 

Power Company (FPL) - Will not waive or reduce bills. BUT will waive late fees during a national, state or local emergency.

fq4rgj,gotfoundout,Can anyone help me understand how to get past this problem with obtaining my last AGI from the IRS?,"I've really messed up here, I know it, and I'm actively working to try to correct these issues. I'm not asking for advice or constructive criticism for how I've handled things in the past, but I would be immensely grateful if any of you can help me out with these processes I'm facing now.

So, I haven't filed taxes in 4 years, but to be completely honest it may be 5, I don't actually remember. It got away from me once, and out of fear and procrastination I just ignored it and now it's turned into a multiple year thing. Believe me, I feel as much an idiot as you're thinking I am. 

Anyway, I finally went and saw a CPA about it, but before they can actually start filing these years for me, I need to get a tax transcript. Herein lies the problem. I cannot request one online, and if I could, it sounds like it would be mailed to an old address of mine anyway.
(Oh, and in case anyone might ask, I did call my CPA about this yesterday but was only able to leave a message, and I haven't heard back yet) 

The reason I can't request online is because one of the pieces of information the IRS says it needs does not exist for me. It requires a financial account number to verify your identity. This can either be a credit card (no debit cards), a student loan account number, a mortgage, or a home equity line of credit. I don't have *any* of those things. Even if I did though, the IRS has my last address on file, that I moved from about 4 years ago.

So of course I tried calling to speak with someone about this and see if there is another way. I called on Monday. Then 3 times on Tuesday. Then a handful on Wednesday. Yesterday I found that I could try a different number, so I called both numbers, every single hour, trying to get through. But I never even got put on hold. One line said they can't take calls due to technical difficulties, the other is saying that due to extremely high call volume, they cannot take my call. It has said this every single time I've called, all day yesterday, and all day today.

Considering the deadline for filing this year has been extended, I normally wouldn't feel that this is such an urgent problem. I mean come on, it's been 4 years, I can get this done in the next few months. But to be completely frank, I'm trying very hard to get the things I need in order to file for '19 so that I don't miss out on the pandemic relief disbursement, because it would be really incredibly helpful for my family right now.

This may have been a little long-winded, I apologize. I'm feeling really frustrated and pretty anxious about the whole thing. Any tips, information, advice or help will be enormously appreciated. Thank y'all so much!

TLDR: I need tax transcripts. Cannot request them online. Cannot get through to a person at the IRS via phone. Do I have any other options?",13,1585340236,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq4rgj/can_anyone_help_me_understand_how_to_get_past/,personalfinance,1

fq4c7u,cruzismypup,Lawyer Representing Debt Collection Agency Demanding Payment By Monday or Extra Charges Will and Damages to my Credit Will Apply,"I apologize in advance for asking on a topic that I know has been addressed here numerous times. I've read quite a few of threads but still have some questions and want some opinions on my personal situation. A lawyer representing a debt collection agency contacted me via phone. The debt is for an Anytime Fitness membership I honestly thought I was still paying for. My job changed about 6 months ago and then this Covid-19 jazz started popping off and so i haven't been back. Not sure that it matters but I renewed a credit card I lost one night and I'm guessing that's the card the membership was on. Anyway, I told him I wanted proof and he said he'd email me a letter. He said I would need to pay by Monday( today being Friday) or lawyer fees and such would be tacked on. Now the amount is only $265 but with rent about other more critical bills coming up I don't have the cash right now. I did tell I could pay next Friday when I get my next paycheck, which I later read I shouldn't have done but it's true and I think I'd rather pay when I can than drag this out too long. Anyway he was insistent that Monday was the cut-off and that he would be filing a summons with the court if this was not paid by then. From what I've read this seems unlikely since is the first direct contact I've had with anyone on this debt even though they said the collection agency's been calling for months. But still i'm not sure and I'd like to see what you all think about this. Also, this debt isn't showing up on my credit report. I've only looked at my Credit Karma though. 

Since, beginning to write this post the email arrived. All it says is they're offering me a settlement for the aforementioned amount and that I need to pay by the Monday or I will suffer the consequences. It also mentions that if I pay it now, it won't affect my credit. Now there is nothing in the email breaking down the amount owed so I still don't know how they arrived at $265. I know i can request a debt verification letter from them, but are they even required to give me a breakdown of the charges? I'd like to see what exactly I'm paying before I pay. Again I'm willing and most likely going to pay next Friday but my big question is, is if I do wait till Friday do I leave myself open to those lawyer fees and a damage to my credit score or is that mostly a scare tactic.

One last thing, the guys was super rude and aggressive even though I told him that once I verified the debt was real I intended to pay by next Friday, so if anyone has a way I can stick it to him a little bit I'm all ears. Perhaps, call him on some B.S or negotiate him down some of the debt owed. I'm not sure If I'd have a leg to stand on negotiating but I'd like to hear your opinions.

fq3z7d,The_JSQuareD,How do I negotiate my rent?,"The lease for my apartment ends in May. My landlord recently gave me a lease-renewal notice and the rent they offered for a 12 month renewal is up $140 (or more than 8%) from my current rent (even more for shorter terms). I don't think this is reasonable given the current situation, and I think I have a decent negotiating position:

 - Most amenities (common room, snacks, gym) have been indefinitely closed due to the current crisis. Similarly, all non-emergency maintenance requests are deferred. I realize this if for the safety of me and the building's staff, but it still means I'm offered a reduced level of service.
 - Depending on which source you believe, rent prices in my area have changed by anywhere from -11% to +4%. They certainly have not increased by 8%. I suspect rent prices will drop quite significantly as the crisis drags on.
 - My city has issued a moratorium on evictions for the time being.
 - I think apartment viewings are halted, and I suspect the rent market in general has cooled significantly as companies freeze their hiring. This makes it much harder for my landlord to find a new tenant if I were to leave.
 - Moving companies are still operating as usual, so I *can* leave.
 - I've been a reliable tenant for 2.5 years, with no missed or late payments (well, once I was a few days late because there was a mix-up over the amount).

I should note that I'm in a financially stable position, and I *can* afford the increased rent. It just doesn't sit right with me to take it though.

fq3y18,squeezedeez,Best way to compare (auto) loans without having to apply first? (Other auto advice welcome),"Hi PF,

Long story short, we're considering getting a new (to us, likely just lightly used certified pre owned) car and are trying to get quotes to find the best auto loans. So many of my searches online try to push you into applying or filling out tons of information, which either results in incessant spam calls or your credit being dinged if you apply and get a hard inquiry on your record.

I've called around a few places and only had success in getting a detailed quote from a person over the phone with one so far; many others have only automated phone systems that basically also push you into applying over the phone or online.

**Does anyone have recommendations for the best way to shop around and compare accurate auto loan rates based on your credit score and terms?**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background details:

CREDIT: 
According to most sources I used, I am on the low end of excellent credit, depending on which credit reporting agency you look at. All report between 736-768. Our mortgage is under my name and so will the car; my husband's credit score, although drastically improved since meeting me, still isn't good enough to be any help.

CAR:
We're looking at 2019ish mini Cooper S 4 door hardtops. I know there are cheaper, more reliable, more practical cars but I never enjoyed driving until I got in one of these. My last car was totaled out by insurance and all we have now are beat up old gas guzzlers we bought cheap off family members. Husband and I are ready to own something we don't hate.

FINANCES: 
I am in a stable job getting paid despite the citrus issues making about $6.5k a month. He makes $3k a month at best, less snow because of the virus. We have $16k in emergency savings and our checking/savings accounts hover around$10k combined, but fluctuate to about $4-5k when bills are paid.

Other general financial advice re: car shopping, loans, insurance etc welcome. I've been doing my research on all of these, but everything online is an ad and I just want to hear from real people I trust 😫",6,1585337815,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq3y18/best_way_to_compare_auto_loans_without_having_to/,personalfinance,2

fq3kux,moneytalk_thrwawy,Where do I put $500 per month?,"So, plans of all sort are up in the air right now due to COVID-19 but here is an overview of the situation.

A close friend will be coming to live with me for a minimum of a year. I have the space and no need to take rent but she would like to pay me $500 per month. Her plans at the end of the year will have her doing work that pays significantly less than she is making right now for a period of perhaps two years. She has suitable savings for all of this to work out and no loans. 

However, we are very close and I am a bit of a worrier. I would like to hold onto the money she gives me in case, at the end of the two years of low pay, she either has difficulty getting back into something more stable, or would like to go to school. In either of those cases, an extra $6,000 or so would certainly be helpful and I would like to have more space to help her than simply suggesting she move back in with me.

I will use the money if something really big comes up but I have very comfortable savings and don't anticipate needing it. Where should I put it as it comes in over the next year and then to sit for two years after that? A little bit of risk is okay, I'm just looking for options and what you guys would do.

Disclaimer: I am not concerned about either of us taking advantage of the other or of having a falling-out here. We have been each-others' safety nets for a decade now, have handled loans and financial gifts between us without hard feeling, and are both aware of the others' financial information.

fq39ku,pcpBandit,A friend may be screwing himself over for life. Never Filed Taxes.,"Hi all, I recently found out my friend has never filed taxes in his life. He's had a rough go at things and was briefly homeless in his 20's but now in his 30's he stepped up and got a great paying job and truly made something of himself.

However, I recently found out during this years tax season that he has never done taxes in his life and is too afraid to start fearing what he owe's may ruin him. Apparently he may be considering to continue to never touch them but did not want to talk about the matter.

I'm truly worried about him. Of course now that the stimulus bill is coming to all who filed in 2018 and 2019 my question is this. 

No matter what, yes he should file his taxes this year and get on track. As a person who was homeless, worked in a factory, and then managed to get into a high paying industry in the last few years, Does he have a lot to fear with what he owes. How should he even begin the process, and if he were to file now, would he qualify for the stimulus? The last part is less important but may help encourage him to file if he gets some assistance financially in case he owes a lot. I want to break down the barrier of fear to get started so that he can get on the right track.",18,1585335814,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq39ku/a_friend_may_be_screwing_himself_over_for_life/,personalfinance,2

My wife (27) and I (28) are really starting to take finances seriously and we are starting to see how royally screwed we both are. How we ignored the FACTS for years.

I have a lot of debt built up from some unforeseen medical treatments from a few years ago. I All is well now besides the debt. We also have a hefty amount of credit card debt, along with 2 cars and a home mortgage.

I found out she was fibbing about credit cards. I found 4 from the past. We both still have stable jobs and are working during these interesting times.

CC 1 - 2531 - 19% interest

CC 2 - 4155 - 12% interest

CC 3 - 2450 16% interest

CC4 - 447.87 - 21%

Now on to mine,

CC 5 - Medical - 7436 - 8% interest

CC 6 - 950 - 0% interest

CC 7 - 447.87 - 19% interest

Car 1 - 11k

Car 2 - 14k

Mortgage - 57k left - 6.5% 30 year - - I think at the very least refinancing home? I am seeing rates around 3.

My question to you all is where do we even start?

Should we consolidate through a personal loan?

Try balance transfers through credit cards, if we could even get approved?

Refinance with extra to take care of debt?

I am so overwhelmed with all of this and it is not boding well on our relationship. We are up to our necks in debt I feel.

I really appreciate any advice on our situation and I thank you all in advance.",7,1585333777,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq2jjr/advicehelp_is_need_and_greatly_appreciated_debt/,personalfinance,1

The drop came from 3 cards that were all under Citi Bank. Here is the breakdown...

1. **Citi1:** $7,100 --&gt; $500. Balance: $50
   1. Starting usage: &lt;1%, Adjusted usage: 10%
2. C**iti2:** $7,500 --&gt; $500. Balance: $175 
   1. Stariting usage: &lt;1%, Adjusted usage: **35%**
3. **Citi3:** $8,000 --&gt; $4,540. Balance: $4,263
   1. Starting usage: 53.28%, Adjusted usage: **93.89%**

**Total Starting Available:** $26,600, **Adjusted Available:** $5,540.

The reason I included that breakdown is because it seems like it was dropped down to the lowest number possible, based on my total debt on each card. 

**My info:** I have 100% on time payments where I have consistently been making larger than my minimum payment on all cards (77 months worth of payments). My score has been increasing slightly each time my payments are reported. This 40 points dropped my from \~690 to \~650. With all of this, it even telling me that I decreased my total balance yet the points dropped this significantly!

**Theory:** With the stock dropping, is there less available liquidity and therefore bank are less likely to allow for any possibility for over spending on their credit lines? If this is the case and their way of dealing with it is to just decrease the available credit, is there any to get that fixed?

I already took what seems like the logical steps. Cancelled all non-essential expenses like gym, spotify, sports, etc etc. I contacted my mortgage company and was able to get a 3 month deferral. I contacted my car fincing and was able to get no payments for the next 3 months if I agreed to extend my lease for 3 months (which I did). 

I have an emergency fund that should last me for a couple of months at least. Normally I keep high balances throughout the month for my credit cards but pay the balances fully and dont accrue interests.

I am not super educated on 0% apr cards, but my understanding is that with a card that offers 0% transfer I should be able to transfer my balance and pay over a longer period. I was wondering if based on my situation it could make sense to do open this card, transfer my balance, keep my expenses low and or course pay before the end of the 0% rate.

Between yesterday and today I have had all my lenders call me to tell me the same thing: They can't do FHA loans under a certain credit score any more.....the most common I am hearing is 640. 

The tl;dr reason I am getting from them: Unemployment is skyrocketing, so a lot of people are going to miss mortgage payments. The stimulus bill mandates servicers to advance up to a year of borrower payments on government-guaranteed/insured and conforming mortgages to every borrower that requests forbearance and attests to financial hardship caused by coronavirus. The mortgage services don't want to be left holding the bag and don't have the liquidity to cover the advances. So any FHA loan that looks marginally risky is getting the hook. I had a couple of FHA transactions that were supposed to close next week. Those would-be home buyers literally got a call from their lender saying they could no longer fund the loan. They are now scrambling to try and figure out where they are going to live, while I am calling every lender I know to see if somehow someone can get their loan closed.

fq0smb,Sylaz,Thinking of Switching my Bank,"So long story short: I've been thinking about how I use my money and my current banking situation. 

Currently I bank with Suntrust and have a free checking account that does nothing but hold my money. I'm thinking of switching to a bank/CU that will provide some kind of APY on what I have.

A couple of things to consider: I don't keep a ton of money in my account currently, I'm in school and most of my income is used to pay bills at the end of the month with little left over. I currently have a Chase Sapphire Preferred card that I use for the majority of my expenses and then pay on that monthly.

There's a decently rated local Credit Union that offers a 1.00% APY if you spend $500 on their debit card a month. This seems to be the best offer I can find locally, but this seems worse than the rewards I get for spending that money with my Sapphire card. Their other option is a checking account that has a 0.01% APY but doesn't require any qualifiers. Something is at the very least better than the nothing I'm getting currently.

That being said I see that something like Ally seems to offer better for no qualifiers as well. Am I misinterpreting something here, or would that make logical sense? Should I open an account with someone like Ally, so my money can sit and accrue a bit of interest between bill payments, but continue to use my Sapphire card for most purchases to gain those benefits as well? I hear lots of talk of Ally here, but is there a better alternative for my situation? Should I try opening a savings account as well and moving what I can to grab a higher APY on what money isn't getting moved in and out of checking?

Thank you all for any insight you can give me.",3,1585328685,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq0smb/thinking_of_switching_my_bank/,personalfinance,1

My mom got audited a decade or so ago and has decided just to have someone else do the family taxes.

Anyways I sent my tax information to her and specifically tell her this is going to be the first year I am not going to be her dependent. Why? Because I graduated college in 2019 and started my first real salaried job and made &gt;20k last year. All of this being said, I cannot physically prove I told her this, but I definitely did.

So H&amp;R does my taxes and a week or so ago I get my tax refund direct deposited. All is good. I didn't question anything. Then comes the talk of the stimulus which in fact will not go out to dependents, those over 18 literally make nothing. I phone my mom just to verify that she did not in fact list me as a dependent, only to find out that she did. I am literally fuming. I was very polite with her on the phone, because you know she's my mom, but the fact she didn't listen to me just cost me $1200... for a $500 tax break? Anyways... I look up what the requirements are for being dependent... and I definitely don't qualify. I definitely paid for &gt;&gt;50% of my own expenses in 2019, probably &gt;75%. I was a full time student... for one semester...

Is there anything I can do to get the $1200? I already have my refund... it's just insane that I am listed as a dependent when in reality I am nothing close to one. I send over a W2 and that's in and my parents list me as a dependent.

fq0j31,autumnandivory,Royal Caribbean holding hostage $3500. Do we have any recourse??,"We paid Royal Caribbean $3500 for a cruise that was supposed to depart on April 18th, 2020. On March 24th, RC cancelled our cruise. Because we like to be on top of financial matters, that day we logged into the website and saw the news about the cancellation and our account said ""there is a problem with your reservation, please call us."" So, I called them and asked for a refund (obviously since the cruise was cancelled by Royal Caribbean not us). RC customer service person told me over the phone that there was no option for a cash refund, but that they could give me a voucher instead. It just crushed us emotionally to hear that. We were using the April 18th cruise for our honeymoon, so there is no reason we would want or need another cruise in the future as we've been forced to make different plans. It was stressful and emotionally difficult to hear that RC is keeping our $3500, especially in a time like this with financial uncertainty and people experiencing job loss and COVID-19 stress. To make matters worse, 2 hours after the phone call, yes... just 2 hours later... RC emailed all of the passengers on cancelled cruises to say that they would offer 100% cash refunds. When I called them back, they refused to give us a cash refund because we already got the ""voucher."" 

I just couldn't believe it. I have never encountered such an incredibly selfish and unethical company like this. If it was $500 or even $1000, sure, we will take the loss, but $3500??? We aren't rich people, we are just a regular couple with normal paying jobs. How can they hold that amount of money hostage from good people? I hope they go bankrupt by the end of this. Honestly, I have no idea what to do. I can't believe the difference in receiving a cash refund vs a worthless voucher was a mere 2 hours. I am really hating myself for calling them right away and not waiting. It's caused us so much stress and honestly, I didn't know where else to vent.

Thanks for listening.

TLDR: Royal Caribbean is only giving cash refunds to some customers, but not all customers who have had their cruises cancelled by RC. Refusing to issue us a refund of the $3,500 we paid for the now cancelled cruise even though we called on the same day the new ""cash refund"" policy was put in place.",61,1585327918,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq0j31/royal_caribbean_holding_hostage_3500_do_we_have/,personalfinance,3

fq0hyv,Tom_Alden,Splitting contributions between 401k and TDA,"Hi all, 
Long-time lurker, first-time poster here.  As mentioned in the title above, my question is about splitting retirement contributions between different employers.

I work two jobs, one of which is a city job.  Aside from my pension, I have the ability to invest in a TDA or 403(b), which (based on my understanding) works pretty similarly to a 401(k).  That employer doesn't match any contributions, because they already support us through a pension system, but I nonetheless have the ability to invest my funds and avoid the tax penalty.  They also allow us to invest in a ""guaranteed yearly 7% fund"" which seems like a safe bet to me.  For the past few years, I've been maxing this out.

Now enter employer number two:  I also do hourly work for a private company on nights and weekends.  They allow me to open a Vanguard account with a very modest 1% match.  Based on what I've read on /r/personalfinance, I'd be throwing money away if I didn't take this.  But up until now, I've kept all of my funds in the TDA just for the sake of simplicity.

Here are my questions:  If I do start contributing to two different plans, how do I best keep track of hitting the contribution limit?  Am I going to need to pull out a calculator and adjust my percentages carefully to keep them as close to a combined 19,500 as possible?  When it's a single employer, they just stop deducting from my paychecks when I hit 19,500.  I don't imagine that'll happen if I split it across two.

With that in mind, here's my other question: is it even worth it to have a second retirement account that I'm investing in just to nab the 1% from my second employer?  For what it's worth, around 2/3 of my income is from the city job and 1/3 my income from the private hourly work.

fq076v,feyfjuhl,Retirement account: Roth 401k Vs Roth In plan conversions,My employer has switched from Vanguard to Fidelity recently. This means I now have the option to keep my traditional 401K (limit 19500) and add Roth in plan conversions up to 10% of my salary (additional 15500 past the 401k limit). I also have the option of a Roth 401K. I understand the Roth in plan conversions allows me to basically contribute more since I can go beyond the 401k limit. However a Roth 401k allows my investments to grow tax free. Which is the better choice? I currently make 155000 as a single earner and am paying an income tax of 24%. I am in my mid 20s. I always hear conflicting advice as to what my income tax bracket will be in retirement. Sometimes I hear it will be higher because my earning potential will grow over time. I don’t understand this because I likely won’t be working in retirement. Doesn’t this mean my income bracket will be lower? Or is it just dependent on how much I end up withdrawing from my retirement accounts at that time?,7,1585326972,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq076v/retirement_account_roth_401k_vs_roth_in_plan/,personalfinance,1

I already have a portfolio established and a separate 401k.  The debate for me boils down to optimism.  I believe, in the long run, that the valuation on the stock market will return to pre-covid19 numbers which means if i get my foot in the door now, the returns will be in the double digits (possible multiples) within a few years (we're talking blue chips like T, GE, etc.)

conversely I can toss the extra cash at a debt and knock that out faster (I've cycled the debt through 0% for x number of months deals so I'm not paying that much on interest and the majority of the debt resides in those 0% accounts).  I've already established a snowball plan for the debt that will have me free and clear in under 30 months so I feel like the debt is managed and in autopilot mode(and with certain rate freezes the pay down rate will increase a bit).  If I put the cash towards debt I would miss out on the opportunity to get into the market at a low point...assuming we have hit the bottom and it's not about to fall out even further.

fq00l4,quiltquilt,"Independent contractor filed 2019 taxes yesterday, are we actually now eligible for unemployment benefits, and is it based on that return?","Hi all, not sure if this is the perfect place to ask this and if so I’m sorry. 

I am an independent contractor and also a part time employee in Virginia. When both places I work closed about two weeks ago I applied for unemployment. I was denied because I had only received around $3100 from my part time job from Oct 2018-2019. I just saw that the bill passed that would allow UI to independent contractors. However 2019 was my first year working as an IC and my 1099 earnings were ~$21,000. I just filed those taxes yesterday with my accountant. So far in 2020 I have been earning about $1k- $2k a week and I expect (well, expected) my 2020 earnings to be higher than last years, but now I’m out of work. 

My questions are -
Does anyone know when I will be able to file for UI in VA as an independent contractor? Will it take months? Is it even official yet? 

Will they base it off of my 2019 tax return, and if so, will it take a while to process due to filing now? 

I’m really panicked that I will not be able to receive benefits. I had a $5000 emergency fund/ savings that is now at $4300 after paying a bill. With paying my car payment, insurance, food and rent it will last about three and half months, and that’s with deferring my student loans. I’d be flat gutted to lose what I finally was able to build up after college. I’m really confused about what’s happening and have no one to ask. Again I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to ask these questions.",3,1585326426,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fq00l4/independent_contractor_filed_2019_taxes_yesterday/,personalfinance,1
fq00j8,dudecool2016,Would freezing my student loan payments affect my credit?,"Hi everyone,

Did not specify but this is for the Fedloan, not my private loans.

Given that the payment freeze is going on for the next six months and given that I believe that things will get better over the next year or two, I would rather invest the money that I would put into the student loan into the market in stocks that are already quite low, or put it into my Roth IRA as a supplement. In other words, an extra \~$300/mo I could contribute to my retirement while stocks are cheapish.

Best case, several companies come out on top with solid dividends to prepare me better for a large purchase or retirement, worst case some companies fail and get bought while some companies end up coming out on top. Worst case, at some point I get return considering I'd be buying things that are at a five year plus low. Worst case, I do have what I feel is sufficient cash stockpiled in the event things go further south.

TLDR: I don't have a need to freeze my debt but at this point. Given that there's 0% interest and no payments, I have zero to lose in doing so with my Fedloan and understand that I will need to pay my private loan. Hate to exploit the crisis but I see this as opportunity, not a threat, to put more into my 401k since I have 40 years at least to worst case get a return at some point, best case have things go really well in the next few months. Does this freeze go on my credit score, and if so, does it have any chance in reducing my credit or does it have any chance of not allowing me to apply for other things like credit cards, loans, etc. while I'm frozen with the provider?

fpzq2s,AmonistlinUYA,PayPal has the worst customer services and disputes process imaginable! Stay away!,"**TL;DR** I have bought 10 different items from a seller using PayPal's goods and services. Only received 6 damaged items that are in terrible condition. Even though I returned those 6 items, my case is closed in favor of the seller after almost 2 months because of the incompetent people at PayPal.

&amp;#x200B;

More than three months ago, I have bought 10 different items by using PayPal's goods and services. Initially, seller provided me with the pictures of eight items, and couple days later I asked him to provide pictures of the other 2 items. Well, as you might expect he told me someone stole most of his inventory from his garage, and he does not have those 2 items anymore. Here is the fist Red Flag.  He said he will send a partial refund to me for those two items. I said okay. Eventually after 2 weeks, he still did not even ship the other 8 items. I got sad, and told him I don't like what is going on anymore, and I would like to cancel this transaction. He started telling me he is on his way to UPS and about the drop the packages off.  He was telling me how much time he and his family spent packing these items. I said okay, just send it and make sure all the items are in perfect condition.

Couple days later, I have received three different packages. And, somehow there were only 6 items in those. Obviously, he did not send two of the most expensive items. The items were in such a terrible condition, and I honestly lost my mind. Funnily, he told me that his friends packaged these items and all of these are because of him. As you can expect, everything that he is telling me is contradictory. Got mad and told the seller to provide me with return shipping labels which he did. He sent me three different shipping labels. Using those labels, I put the items back in the packages he sent with and dropped it off at UPS the very next day.

I told him to refund me all my money, but he was telling me he needs to sell some items first. After a week of waiting, I asked him again for the refund. He said whether I would accept if he can send me different items. I lost my mind again and told him just refund my money, but he stopped responding, and I escalated the case to PayPal. And what I saw was seriously terrible. He was selling some of the items I have returned on eBay already before providing my refund.

Anyway, I have provided PayPal with pictures of the items I received and tracking numbers from return shipping labels. Here comes another incompetent company, UPS. Somehow, they managed to lost one of the packages I sent. And, the seller received two of the packages. Since the seller bought the return shipping labels, UPS told me that they send a paperwork to him for the claim of the lost package which he still did not fill.

After all, even though I have provided every single information PayPal asked for, they closed my case in favor of the seller, and I got denied because of that lost package which is not even my responsibility at that point anymore. After all the talk that I had with different dispute agents all telling me that I will got my refund, and this case will be closed in favor of me, they still managed to be the same incompetent company that people are continuously pointing out.

Imagine being this incompetent that you can write "" This decision was made because we did not receive valid proof or tracking that you returned the merchandise. "". Seriously???? What was the proof of shipping that I send you??? This is a straight up robbery from PayPal. And, I am asking everyone here to point me to the right direction about what I should do so that PayPal won't get away with this. By the way, I just opened a dispute with Amex. At least, they have a really good customer service that can help me for getting my refund back.",85,1585325538,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpzq2s/paypal_has_the_worst_customer_services_and/,personalfinance,5

fpzlwf,waffles_88,Should I refinance or hold off?,"Before all this mess happened, I had a plan to sell my condo and buy a duplex, but now I have no idea what to do and could really use some advice. I got very lucky with when I purchased it, as it's gone from a value of $158 to $200K in a little under 2 years. I don't think the market is THAT hot and wouldn't expect it to keep appreciating anywhere near that rate if I kept it, I just got a good deal.

&amp;#x200B;

My job is about as secure as anyone's right now, and I have an emergency fund I'm relatively happy with and for what I'd need to close on the condo, I should have enough leftover from a sale to have a healthy reserve fund for the duplex as well. my main two issues are that I have a pretty lousy interest rate on my mortgage, and I also have some concerns about the health of the building and the HOA's reserve fund, although it's also in a very desirable community in a hot market (austin). my current APR is 4.75, and if I apply by today for a refinance with my current lender, they'll wave their fees and give me 3.5%. I'm currently torn between 3 options:

1. Don't refinance, hopefully sell sometime in the summer and maybe I don't make quite as much off of the sale, but if that happens then I'm probably getting a pretty good deal on the duplex, and I should just be happy I dodged any major repairs or special assessments at the condo.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Refinance now and wait a year or so. The refinance is cheap enough that my break even point would get here pretty quickly, and even if I end up selling before that, having an extra $1200 liquid in exchange for losing $1500 in equity isn't TOTALLY unapallatable.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Refinance now and keep the condo for the long haul. I don't have to decide between this and #2 right now, but maybe it just makes sense to accept that I'm probably going to be hit with some major bills at some point, but in the long run keeping and renting out the condo and putting off a duplex for a much longer time makes the most financial sense. My main fear is that with the way the housing market is moving, I don't know when I'll ever be able to save enough to buy the second property.",5,1585325210,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpzlwf/should_i_refinance_or_hold_off/,personalfinance,1

I can't bring myself to share it with anyone. The information is so plentiful and very sensitive. If I gave it to someone, and if some day I had my ID stolen or an account hacked, I don't want even a kernel of thought in my head that this trusted person may have misused the info.

fpz9w0,CBTBen,Negotiating a better buyout price on my ending lease,"Hello, not sure if this is exactly a PF question but it seemed like the right place to ask.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have a 2017 Hyundai Elantra I leased and the term ends on April 20th this year. I'm fine on mileage and the condition of the car is great. The stated residual value is \~$11,000 and while I always was considering buying it outright at the end of the lease I never really thought that I'd pay that for it. I assumed I'd be able to negotiate down to a lower price.  


Given everything going on right now (Will the dealership even be open to return the car?) my assumption is that I can get a \*much\* better price but I'm not sure who exactly to negotiate with.  I leased from a Hyundai dealership in town, financed through Hyundai Motor Finance. On the Hyundai Motor Finance page they say any buyout should be made paid to something called ""HCA Exchange, Inc.""  


So my questions would be 1) Who do I negotiate with? The dealership or HMF or this HCA company? and 2) How likely am I to be able to get a good deal on the car? Am I correct in guessing that they'll be anxious to not take on this inventory right now?

- Since the markets are way down and will likely rebound over the course of 20 years, should I max my contributions to a Roth IRA for this year and just eat the 6% contribution tax for until I am working next year?

Both my husband and I are deemed 'essential personal' (he's a mechanic, I'm a teacher teaching remotely) so we are both getting paid, also my husband is disabled from the military so we get some money from there.  Today we got an email from our bank letting us know they are offering a 90 day break on our loan payments (we have a 15 year mortgage, 2 car loans, a personal loan and a credit card we can defer).  Interest will accrue but no late fees no hit to the credit report.  Our plan would be to defer the house (1200), and the cars (900) for the three months to get 6300 and pay off the personal  loan and the credit card.  

I'm not sure of the cost/benefit analysis here.  I am extremely debt adverse other than a house but my husband is not (as you can see) we are slowly chipping away at his past debt as I have none, and he wants to get to the none point as well.   My initial thought was that we would just keep paying our stuff and keep moving forward and he is the one that came up with the above plan.

There are so many variables and I am already ashamed of how horrible I am with math, so please don't judge me :(

Home value: \~$240-260k

Current mortgage balance: $169,477.03

Current interest rate: 3.625%

New loan amount (80% ltv): $200,000

New interest rate: 4.25% (from my credit union - currently getting other quotes too)

Cash out after closing costs: $24,000

High-interest debt: \~$11,500 

Medium-interest debt: \~$2,500

The new mortgage would increase my monthly payment by about $100. Paying off the debt listed above would save $450/month. 

So I'd be pocketing about $350 a month if I could pay those off with my cash out. I'd also have $10,000 left to put towards paying off my car ($2500) or to put into savings to avoid getting into debt again (I currently have NO savings and two babies to worry about). 

I'm just trying to determine if I'm messing up by opting for a higher interest mortgage here. Am I losing significantly more money in the long run? I also have no idea what the outlook is for the economy and housing market. Should I cash out now before my home's value plummets?

I'm 28. Married. 2 kids. Full time employed at job I really enjoy with great benefits. Making 11.75 an hour. Wife is stay at home mom which eliminates child care costs. Monthly bills equal out to about $1,200 ($495 of which is rent). Live in a LCoL area. Median home cost is right at 100k. 

**Now to my questions**

Ok so my question essentially is living the above life, how am I ever supposed to afford to come up with the money for a down payment on a home. I would much rather be spending $500 for a mortgage on something that I'm actually investing in rather than paying my landlords mortgage. 

I'm working with only a HS Diploma and I have a good paying job for my town. A lot of minimum wage jobs in my area. I would like to go back to school but it doesn't seem feasible even with federal student aid. 

My wife is a stay at home mom to watch the kiddos which keeps us from paying $500-1000 a month to child care. 

So my biggest question from all this is **how can I afford to save up for a down payment on a home?**

fpxv7q,googs185,Getting out of a difficult housing situation,"  

I’ve been wanting to post this for a long time and I’m finally doing it! Please forgive the length of the post. 

I’m currently on the path to FIRE but there is a significant obstacle in the way. Some backstory: While I was living at home with my parents, they made me give them $500 a week that they were “putting away” for me for when I got married/bought a house. The balance reached $30,000 before I got married. We got married and the money wasn’t available (because the money was tied up in one of their houses that my sister and brother in law were living in but couldn’t get a mortgage on because he works under the table). When we went to buy a house 3 years later, they still didn’t have the money because my sister still hadn’t taken over the mortgage. That is problem #1. When we went to buy a house, we were in a rush, unfortunately. We were kicked out of our apartment because the town had purchased the property and the building was going to be demolished. We didn’t want another year lease and decided to start looking for a house. Our former landlord let us live in his basement apartment for a couple of months while we looked. We looked at many houses with our real estate agent and I think she became fed up with showing us so many houses. We looked at houses of all sizes but decided on a very small house, well below my means, to keep expenses down and hasten our journey to FIRE. We found one in the town I grew up in Connecticut and it was listed for $220k, a short sale.  It was on a nice, quiet street within walking distance of the elementary, middle and high schools. There were already 8 bids on the house and our RE agent made us put in a $255k bid, saying we wouldn’t get it if we didn’t (which I think was exorbitant, and I feel that the other bids were LOWER than $220k). The bid, of course, was accepted. I don’t know how, but the house comped on the bank assessment and we were given the mortgage at 3.375%.  Here start the problems: The house is a ranch and only 1050 square feet and only has one bathroom with a plastic corner shower (no bath). It has two bedrooms with very small closets and another room without a closet-so only two bedrooms. There is no upstairs living room or dining room, just a space when you walk in that is serving as our dining room in front of the fireplace and picture window. The basement, fortunately, is finished, and the family room is down there, but we need to use electric heaters down there. The furnace is low-efficiency, the cheapest the previous owner could put in. We found out the house was owned by a previously very rich family that lost everything. They didn’t care about the house, as they didn’t plan on staying there. The house was built in the late 1940s, block construction, with no insulation in the walls. It can get cold in the winter and hot in the summer due to lack of insulation and we can’t add insulation without reframing all the interior walls.  The previous owner was a hack and did a lot of work unprofessionally, causing me more work. The lawn and landscaping were horrible, many trees needed to be taken down, I needed to put in new gutters and fascia and spent countless hours removing ivy from the house.  The rear patio had to be replaced since the former owner built it up to the level of the rear door and water would come in the house. The front porch was rotting and I had to have masonry stairs put in. In short, I’ve probably spent over $20k in upgrades and repairs in the past 3 years we’ve owned the house.  What is worse, our neighbor’s house, which is much nicer just sold for $279k. An old lady lived there and kept it immaculate and well-maintained. It  is 1800 sq feet, has 5 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, sunroom and a 2 car garage (we have one car garage). From what my RE agent tells me, we are in a seller’s market now. When I saw what it sold for, I was fumigating. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel we severely overpaid for the house, we have PMI because I was screwed by my parents on the $30k.  All of the reasons we bought a small house for (savings on utilities, taxes, maintenance, etc) seem to be completely irrelevant and we really aren’t saving much than we would’ve paid on a larger home.  I’m looking for advice. Should we get out of this home? Despite it’s shortcomings, the house is very cute and has curb appeal. It has stucco, which is atypical for our area. The neighborhood is very nice. The school system is top notch. We live very close to my parents and sister/brother in law so they can help with our baby at times. I don’t want to dump money and put an addition on it to bring it up to the houses around it. A local contractor wanted $85k just to increase the size of the master bedroom, add a bathroom and increase the size of the bonus room to add a closet to make it a bedroom. I know I’ll need to at least add a bath and redo the ONE bathroom it has. 

My financial situation: I’m 31. I make $130k a year, my wife stays home with our infant daughter. I have $28k left in student loan debt currently at a 1.9% interest rate that will be paid off in less than two years. We have one paid off car (a cheap beater to get to work, which is less than 5 miles from my home), and a reliable car with one more year of payments on it. I’m maxing out my employer 401k  ($19k)and  Roth IRA and  have $20k in an emergency fund. Current investments in retirement funds were at $40k before the crash. I also have about $25k in my checking account ready to use for investing or real estate. 

Sorry for the long-winded story. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Again, my goal is to FIRE as soon as possible. I’m not sure if we should sell the home or stay in it. I’m not sure if I should start investing in real estate or dump more in the stock market.

Due to the ongoing situation, we're very short on work at my job. Even if things get better, I estimate we'll have about two to three more weeks of work if we're lucky. Our boss works remotely and occasionally checks in, and though I've tried to ask for additional projects to work on, she always says no. I have a little bit of job security just because the only other person who does what I do is going on maternity leave soon, but it may not be enough to save my job. 

I know that I cant make up work, but I'm scared to be laid off, and will likely need to talk to the boss soon. She may cut my hours, she may put me on unpaid leave temporarily, or she may lay me off. I have a 6 month's emergency savings fund, but I was really hoping I wouldn't have to tap into so I could use it to go to college some day.

1. I'm full-time, and if they cut my hours or put me on unpaid or reduced paid leave, can I file for unemployment? 

2. How many hours can my work cut before I'd be making more money through benefits if I was just fully laid off? 

3. Ive was told I should initially avoid immediately finding odd jobs like gas station attendant or grocery bagger, and spend more time looking for a good job if possible. They said taking a lower job would look bad on my resume, Id be more burned out if I'm looking for a better job while I'm working one I hate, and people would be more understanding of a few months gap due to the virus.

fpxmox,the_3in1_adventure,Is negative equity on a car loan EVER worth it?,"Hey! My fiancé and I purchased a 2019 Kia Sorento in May 2019 from a Kia dealership. It was our first car purchase. We did end up having some buyer’s remorse for the following reasons:

1. $324 biweekly, 84-month financing at 7.99% - High interest rate, long term loan made me nervous and payments were a wee bit above budget (by a wee bit, I mean more like a lot). 

Originally, we wanted to get a cheaper used car (budget: &lt;$20,000) but the $8,000 cash-back offered by the dealer was a pretty attractive option at the time. That cash back was only available on the purchase of a brand new, more expensive car. The Sorento was valued at ~38k. We paid off most of our credit card debt with that cash back.

So I was making breakfast two days ago when I got a random phone call. I answered, and it was the Kia dealership that sold us our car 10 months prior. They were letting us know about low interest rate promotions they have going on. “You could qualify for a 0.99% interest rate if you’re interested in trading-in your car!” I was skeptical but kept an open mind. Going from 7.99% to 0.99% is a big jump worth looking into, in my opinion. I let them check our eligibility for this rate and yes, we were eligible. They asked if we wanted to come in to know more and check out some models so we decided to go in the next day. 

Fast-forward to yesterday afternoon, we test drove a 2020 Kia Sportage SX Turbo. Going in, I was hoping that if we did decide to trade in our Sorento, it would be for a car cheap enough to keep our biweekly payments roughly the same. I didn’t feel great about looking into a trade in so early on in our financing due to the negative equity from the car we barely paid for. 

The dealership offered us only $24.5k for the Sorento. We were hoping for at least $27k but that’s the most they could do. My question to them was: is rolling over that much money into a new loan really worth the crazy low interest rate? Their answer was yes, but I was still skeptical. They convinced me when they said that we’d be paying down our principal much faster than with that 7.99% rate. More money goes to the car, less to the bank.

I did not think we would be walking out of that dealership 3 hours later having signed a bill of sale and loan paperwork for that Sportage, but we sure did. 

My regrets: 

1. I rushed the decision. I told myself I wouldn’t but we were getting close to them closing for the day and I wouldn’t have had time to come back for a little while. What if the deal was gone after a few days? I let them pressure me into making a choice right then and there, I should have slept on it.

2. We are now binded to a loan of 69k over 84 months, $389 biweekly at 1.85% (apparently the bank could only offer 0.99% for loans less than 21k... 1.85% is still better than 7.99% though.... right?). That’s an extra $130 a month out of our pockets and we have reset to 84 months of payments ahead of us. Negative equity rolled over was ~20k. 

3. I think we should have waited at least 2-3 years before considering this, to reduce the negative equity rolled over. But how much interest money were we throwing away with that 8% rate?? 

I need some perspective. Are we complete idiots or was there some sense in rolling over that much negative equity to slash our interest rate? Be as harsh as you need to be, I really need some guidance. We’re feeling SO stupid right now but are we overreacting?

For your info, we haven’t even driven this car off the lot yet, that’s happening in 6 hours.",144,1585318444,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpxmox/is_negative_equity_on_a_car_loan_ever_worth_it/,personalfinance,1

fpwu30,Werewolfdad,Why the Fed setting the Reserve Rate to 0% doesn't matter for you.,"Good morning /r/personalfinance,

After screaming into the wind over in /r/news, I thought I'd come explain to you why the Reserve Requirement Ratio being set to 0% doesn't matter for you.  There seem to be some significant misunderstandings about what it means, what the Reserve Requirement does, and how it affects consumers.  

First, the Reserve Requirement is the amount of cash (or cash equivalents) bank's must maintain on deposit at the Fed.  This money is used to settle interbank transactions and to encourage banks to maintain a certain level of **liquidity**.  

Second, if a bank's reserve account is below the limit set by the Fed, they simply borrow from other banks, overnight, at the Fed Funds rate.   Banks with excess reserves will lend money to other banks with insufficient reserves at the Fed Funds Rate.  On balance sheets, these are recorded as Fed Funds Purchased and Fed Funds Sold.   When the Fed Funds Rate is 0% (like it is now), bank's can effectively borrow from each other for free (realistically, almost free, since they'll still pay a few basis points).  If the banks can't borrow from other banks (due to credit concerns, for instance), the bank can borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at the Discount Window (which currently has a rate of 0.25% for primary credit and 0.75% for secondary credit) to maintain adequate reserves.  Setting the reserve requirement to zero, simply means bank's won't need to borrow from the fed or from each other at a very nominal rate.  It essentially eliminates a small expense for banks while greatly reducing accounting transactions and interbank liabilities.  

So, what does this mean for the average depositor?  

**Nothing**. 

Just because bank's don't need to keep liquidity at the Fed, doesn't mean they *won't*.  They just don't need to incur an expense if their liquidity levels dip below the prior rate of 10%.  Banks area also required to maintain Contingency Funding Plans (Funding and Liquidity Risk Management -Interagency Guidance) that creates a framework to ensure they maintain sufficient liquidity levels in times of stress and have sufficient contingent liquidity sources to meet their needs in those specific times of stress.  

Additionally, large banks are subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which is a requirement of Basel 3 (which are basically international banking accords).  This requires Large Banks to maintain sufficient liquid assets to cover 1 month of out going cash flows.  

&gt;Will this cause my bank to fail?

Unlikely at this point.  Compared to the 2008 crisis, banks are better capitalized, have better liquidity risk management processes (including the above mentioned contingency funding plans), and hold higher levels of liquidity.  Banks are in a better position to defer borrowers, allowing them to recover before they become past due.  

&gt;Does this mean bank's can lend an unlimited amount of money?


No, *No*, **No,** A thousand times no.   This is the biggest misconception I've see (and honestly, the entire reason for my post).  A reserve ratio of 0% does not mean banks can lend an unlimited amount of money.  It means they can lend 10% more money (at most).  Think of the reserve requirement as the minimum you need to maintain in your checking account before you start incurring maintenance fees.  The Fed has simply waived that balance requirement and is waiving all the fees for everyone.  

&gt;But what about Fractional Reserve Banking?  Doesn't that mean bank's can lend out money they don't have?

No.   Per accounting rules, bank's can't lend out money they don't have. For every dollar of assets (loans, investments, cash, etc), they need to have $1 in liabilities (deposits or loans)) or capital equity (surplus, retained earnings, etc).  

IF a bank has $100 in liabilities/capital, the bank must have $100 in assets.  If a bank has $200 in liabilities/capital, they must have $200 in assets.  There's a reason we call the balance sheet a balance sheet.  Because it needs to **balance**.  

Further, banks are constrained by their Capital ratio (Assets divided by capital).  This is part of Basel II, Basel III, 12 CFR 3, 12 CFR 6, and various parts of interagency guidance.  Leverage ratios are around 9% for Large bank holding companies, and 10% for other bank holding companies (https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2018-november-financial-stability-report-leverage.htm).  This means banks are leveraged about 10 to 1.  This is much different than the financial crisis when it was closer to 20-1.  (5%).  And certainly much higher than Lehman Brothers, which had a leverge ratio of 31-1 (or 3.2%). 


I hope this effectively explains why the reserve requirement going to zero doesn't matter for you.

I bought my first ever nice car at the end of Oct. $11,000 for an excellent condition Toyota Prius. 

In mid January I experienced black outs and seizures. Never had anything like this before.

Doctor says I cannot drive due to risk of having seizures and even the meds have bad side effects.

I know this is not the car dealers fault but is there a chance they will allow me to return the car or at least buy back for most of the price I paid?

What is my best chance of getting most or all of my money back without hurting my credit score?

I know they do not owe me anything. I am dealing with a lot of issues, not working due to medical issues, and cannot afford $325 per month for car payment and insurance to have a car just sit in my driveway.

If I can drive again in the future, i will definitely buy from them again. Hopefully this is not permanent. I am only 42 and giving up driving is difficult to accept and happened out of nowhere and abruptly. 

What I fear is selling car for only $7000 to private owner or back to dealer and then owe payments for $4000 for a car I barely used. 

The amount of miles I drove since I purchased is very low so hopefully they will take that into consideration.

It is a Toyota Prius 2010, I probably overpaid a little bit. They sell well here in southern California so they should not be out much,  right?  I mean, I know it is inconvenient that they need to do paperwork and all.

fpwdx2,Sagethea,Need help balancing my finances,"Hello, i'm doing too much overtime and losing myself in the work as a private contractor as part of an enterprise with kinda crappy rates.

Ok so quick example from January: 

Apartment rent for 2 people: 613€ 39%
Car costs (fuel, insurance, repairs) 443€ 28%
Groceries 309€ 20%
Eating out/buying leftovers through ResQ 100€ 6%
Purchases(not monthly, in this case a webcam and headphones) 84€ 5%
And phone internet package 25€ 2% (also includes a ton of calls and messages to my home country so a little bit pricy.)

Total expenses 1576€

Total income this time was 1716 after paying income tax and enterpreneur insurance.

Not crazy overspending when it comes to food, i generally try to be on the conservative side. However my fiancee is still a student with some sides to depression so it was my decision to handle the finance side. 
Can't ask her to go work, she's already having a hard time with keeping productive i don't want to burden her even more. 

To get these amounts i tend to work overtime and have done like 10-12 sometimes 15h workdays just to be safe and 6-7 days a week.

fpwbtx,joenorwood77,Return Car?,"This is a long shot but maybe someone here has advice...

I bought my first ever nice car at the end of Oct. $11,000 for an excellent condition Toyota Prius. 

In mid January I experienced black outs and  seizures.  Never had anything like this before.

Doctor says I cannot drive due to risk of having seizures and even the meds have bad side effects.

I know this is not the car dealers fault but is there a chance they will allow me to return the car or at least buy back for most of the price I paid?

What is my best chance of getting most or all of my money back without hurting my credit score?

I know they do not owe me anything.  I am dealing with a lot of issues, not working due to medical issues, and cannot afford $325 per month for car payment and insurance to have a car just sit in my driveway.

If I can drive again in the future,  i will definitely buy from them again.  Hopefully this is not permanent. I am only 42 and giving up driving is difficult to accept and happened out of nowhere and abruptly. 

What I fear is selling car for only $7000 to private owner or back to dealer and then owe payments for $4000 for a car I barely used. 

The amount of miles I drove since I purchased is very low so hopefully they will take that into consideration.",1,1585313200,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpwbtx/return_car/,personalfinance,1

fpvxx1,yes_its_him,What we know about stimulus payments,"So, the House is going to vote on the stimulus bill today.  Or,  maybe not, that's still a bit up in the air.  But they probably will, and it will probably pass.  So if the current bill passes, what does that mean?

Here's the bill if you want to read it yourself: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6819239-FINAL-FINAL-CARES-ACT.html

But since reading something that long is not very reddit, here's a tl, dr of what this says about just stimulus payments in section 2201 (starting page 144) of the very very long bill (and not e.g. unemployment extensions, student loans, IRA distributions, etc):

1.  We start out with the idea that individuals get up to $1200, and joint filers get up to $2400 as a refundable credit against their 2020 taxes, paid somewhat immediately but during 2020 in any event.  This means you get to keep the money and it's not taxable income.   We'll see next who *doesn't* get this; the presumption is everyone starts out eligible, even if you didn't file taxes, didn't pay taxes, whatever your situation. 

1a.  What is a ""refundable tax credit""?  Why, it's as allowed by ""[subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-A/part-IV/subpart-C).""  Any questions?  In general, a refundable credit is money you get paid directly by the government, that you get to keep.   

2.  Then you add in $500/child 16 or under. 

3.  You reduce this amount by 5% of your gross income over $75,000 ($150,000 filing jointly, $112,500 filing HoH).   So it goes away at $99,000/$198,000 (a bit higher if children are involved).

4.  You can't get this if you are dependent on someone else's return ""for a taxable year beginning in the calendar year in which the individuals taxable year begins"", so that's not super clear.   The idea is they will start with the 2019/2018 status, since they know that.  It's not immediately obvious what this means to people who were dependents in 2019 but not in 2020, but the presumption is they won't get a payment, or at least not initially.  

5.  The will deliver the payments to any electronic bank account on file as of 2018 or later where they have that, as soon as practical.  They would issue paper checks otherwise.  

6.  You have to have an SSN/taxpayer ID on file to get the money.

7.  If you didn't file a tax return in 2019 or 2018, then they will use information from Social Security (e.g. what your employer reported paying) to determine that you are eligible.   But they won't have your electronic information on file in that case, so you would have to wait to get a check.  

8.  You will get a letter in the mail at your last known address saying how they made your payment.   

9.  The payments are not subject to offset for e.g. unpaid previous taxes or student loans, etc.  

So, that's what we know so far, just what's in the bill.  The actual mechanics, timing, etc., would then depend on information not in the legislation, and so subject to elaboration and change.  So far the IRS says:

""Stimulus payment checks: No information available yet, No sign-up needed
Instead of calling, please check back for updates.""

fpun74,nicknaseef17,Quick question about a final paycheck...,"So I recently changed jobs and received my final paycheck from my former company today. Unfortunately, there are two (possibly three) issues with it. The first issue is that they have not included a bonus that I was promised. The second is that one of the items on the paycheck reads ""PUCC"" - which I assume refers to the company car I returned - and looks to be a deduction of $151. I have absolutely no idea what this deduction is for, nor do I understand why it's on there as this does not appear on any of my other paychecks over the course of 3+ years.   


The final (potential) issue, the one I'm posing here about, is about my salary itself. My final two weeks with the company took place during two separate pay periods. So, my final week comprised of half of a pay period. Because of this, I was paid half of what I would normally be paid per pay period. While this doesn't seem unreasonable to me (I mean I did work for only one week out of the two weeks falling under this pay period's umbrella) - I do wonder if it is correct. Are companies required to pay you your full wage? They are based in Pennsylvania and I was working in Michigan if that is a factor.

I currently ""Take the match"" from my employer for my 401K plan. My car is paid off and insurance costs are low. I also invest about ~5%-6% of my net take home into an acorns account that I basically set up and forget about.

I've read the IRA wiki but still had some questions concerning which type of IRA I should utilize (I.E. im still basically clueless). I dont know whether to open up a traditional or roth. I also read somewhere that it may be more advantageous to max out contributions to a traditional and then immediately convert it into a back door roth (I dont really understand what this means either). And on top of all that would it be more advantageous to increase my contribution to my 401k instead?

As a side note I'm also looking at buying my first home this year and have already saved a down-payment for that, and I know that that decision will probably have some bearing on my investment options.

A couple years ago I moved to Germany. For the first year I was here, I was kind of getting the lay of the land and waiting to hear back about my freelance visa. Luckily it came through and I've been happily working in Berlin for about a year now. 

When I first moved here, I looked into filing taxes (in the US) abroad for the year of 2018, but read on the IRS website that it wasn't necessary to file if your gross income was under the personal exemptions amount and standard deduction combined. I took that to mean that it was unnecessary to file given that I did not have any income (lived off of savings that entire year).

Now that I've been working in Berlin for a year now, however, I'm a little confused as to what I'm required to report. I work as a freelancer in the film/video industry. Am I still required to pay income tax in the US, despite earning all my money and paying taxes here in Germany? How do I file at all if I don't have any 1099s or W2s?

fpu154,Guatemalaptb,Amazon charged me $40 after I accidentally signed up for a professional account,"I was trying to sell a few personal items on amazon. The whole process of signing up for a seller account was very confusing for me. I accidentally signed up for a professional account. I don’t know the details of a professional account but I do know they charge $40 a month to have one. I know this because I woke up to a $40 charge on my bank statement. I did some research and realized that the account that fit me better was a personal account. A personal account is free, amazon automatically takes $1 for every sale plus a percentage. 

I reached out to amazon support saying that I mistakenly signed up for the account, and asked if I could have a refund after I deactivated my account (I had not listed or sold any items yet). I got a response back saying in order to get the refund I needed to add tax details to the account. This meant putting my social security number in, which I felt uncomfortable with. I tried calling the customer support number, but received a message about slower service due to the Coronavirus. I tried the online chat and saw a similar message, as well as no way to access the chat. Is there anything else I can try or should I just accept the loss? 

Also if anyone knows any other services for selling books online that would be a bonus.

As soon as I moved to NYC (from somewhere very rural) I sold my car and have since enjoyed not needing one.

Now I'll be moving somewhere far less urban, but still not what you'd call rural. I've asked about it, and have been told I could manage to live without a car there, if I really want to. It's no NYC though, I can't walk everywhere or take a subway. I could walk some places, based on the exact location of my apartment, take buses to some places when schedules match, and use uber or the like for anywhere else, and then when I don't wish to deal with those options have things delivered. To be clear, delivery here isn't just ordering a pizza, but also (possibly, and if so not every time) grocery delivery and buying things online instead of in a store.

The location in question is Manchester New Hampshire, for what that's worth.

fptlbz,S417M0NG3R,Does the number of jobs lost make this situation different?," 

These are strange times. The market has been all over the place, it's actually up 3-4k over the most recent bottom. I've read many times before, every time one of these hits, we think it's different, and it never is.

But, the 3 million jobless claims gives me pause. That's a lot of people suddenly unemployed, more than 4 times as much as ever previously recorded. Right now there are fewer positions because companies are shutting down and scaling back all over the place. When this whole thing ""blows over"", will those positions suddenly come back and absorb a large amount of that number, or will this cause economic damages to persist?

One of the scariest things about the 2008 recession to me was the job losses. Here we have that even worse. I hope that the job losses are restricted to certain sectors hit hardest due to the unique nature of the situation, but I am worried about the ripples that will spread out to other sectors.",1,1585298987,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fptlbz/does_the_number_of_jobs_lost_make_this_situation/,personalfinance,1

Is there anybody here who can assist me in understanding my wife's income tax? I have sat down with it for hours and I still don't understand it.

She is employed, has a company car and a company fuel card (including personal use), and gets a non-guaranteed performance related annual bonus.

HMRC told her last year that she owed them money for some reason, and she has been paying back over £200 in tax to clear the debt. We do not understand why. 

We also don't understand why her benefits are taken out of her £12.5K tax free allowance, leaving her with a negative tax free allowance. Why is this not just added on the top of her wage?

She is currently PAYE and has never filled out a tax return, it is all done by her employer.

fpt9t3,dead-out-side,Investment advice (noob starting out),"Hi reddit community!

I'm an investment noob and am trying to figure out how I can start investing for the long term. I played around with some individual stocks before this but sold most of them for a down payment. I still have some shares which are giving me a nice $1000/year dividend and intend to let them sit for a few more years.

I have about $2000 to invest per month. I would like to build a portfolio that is moderately risk averse and will lead to a good monthly (being vague here since I am not sure what is a reasonable amount) passive income after 10 or more years. I am thinking that DRRIP is the best way to do this. This will be a taxable account. Here is my current plan:

1. 40% in VTSAX
2. 40% in REIT (I'm thinking Realty Income or Stor Capital)
3. 10% in long term bonds
4. 10% in intermediate term bonds

Does this sound like a good plan? Looking forward to suggestions from the community!

I am trying to create a plan that's as close to what I was looking at before the COVID-19 crash (although it has humbled me greatly and made me realize the value of having an emergency fund)

I have already maxed out my 401k and ROTH IRA - although I'm thinking of using my ROTH IRA for at least a part of REIT investments to save on the additional capital gains tax.

fpsv7b,mythril606,Apartment not returning Application fee?,"A few days ago I decided to put in an application for an apartment. I should say now this was done all over the phone and on the other side of the country from the apartment complex due to the virus. The application was for one specific model and bedroom/bathroom count and I made it clear this was the only floorplan I was interested in as well as it being listed on the application. I was approved, no issues of course and all that was left was to generate the lease and sign it but due to closing time we were going to have to finish the lease tomorrow.

The next morning their office calls me and tells me that the current residents have decided to renew their lease in that unit, the only one available, and that I would not be able to rent it. They immediately tried to get me to look at their other, much smaller floorplan with the same BR/Bath count (972sqft compared to 800sqft) for basically the same price and a worse overall layout, which I was not interested in as it's not worth anywhere near the price.

So my question now is am I entitled to a return of the application fee? I changed nothing on my side. They came to me forcing me to change the floorplan I specifically applied for, but now are saying because I don't want to rent an apartment I made clear I did not want or like in the first place that the application fee is forfeit. I realize applicatiom fees are almost always advertised as non-refundable, but this just can't be fair.

Every time when I see someone post a topic asking something like......... 

Topic: ""I have a stable job and making good amount of money, should I buy a nicer car to reward myself?""

Personalfinance: ""NOPE !!! Dont dare think about buying that !! You should get a $500 shitbox only and nothing else!! Use the rest of your money to saving/invest instead""

Or this.....

Topic: ""Should I go to the shopping mall and reward myself with some now clothes?""

Personalfinance: You better don't do that ! Just continue to wear you old clothes until they rip apart. Use the money you have to saving/invest.

Or this.....

Topic: ""I have a stable job and making good amount of money, should I buy a bigger and nicer house to reward myself and my family?""

Personalfinance: Do not do that, you should  continue to live in the house you have paid off and use the money you have to saving/invest.

The list can go on and on.....
This basically made me wonder..... if you are not going to spend the money you earn to reward yourself with anything at all, how can you be happy and enjoy with your life then?

Or is seeing more money growth in your bank account is a form of happiness to some people or something?

I am a student and for the 2019-2020 academic school year, I received student loans and some scholarship money. I am considered my parents dependent for the 2019 year but won't be for the year 2020. If I file, would the government return the taxes that were on my loans(for example when I was disbursed $1,000 they take ~$15) since it wasn't that much (under $10,000)? I'm asking because last time I filed my taxes, I made about $5,000 and I was told that I'd be receiving all the taxes I paid because I barely made anything which was totaled to ~$150 for my tax return.

   2. You become vested in matching contributions after you are credited with three years of vesting services. A year of vesting service is defined as a calendar year in which you complete 1,000 hours of service.
   3. You can contribute from 1% to 90% of your eligible pay on a pre-tax basis, a Roth after-tax basis, or both, subject up to the annual IRS limits. For calendar year 2020, the IRS limit is $19,500.

How can I help?,"His highest completion of school was Jr. High, he worked in masonry as his father encourage all the sons to do to support the large family. Dad’s birthday is coming up in April, I just learned tonight that he and my brother may lose the house. 

There are things they don’t want to give up and recurring spending on bills like 4 cars insurance, gas/water/trash, a ridiculous power bill, insane internet/cable bill, lots of money towards meals, eating out for lunch, alcohol and tobacco consumption. They don’t want to downgrade or sell anything. Big victims of target mail ads, commercials, seasonal purchases, online shopping, sport, construction and holiday buys. 

There are issues with leaky a leaky roof, overflowing septic tank, leaky basement walls and I just new am being awakened by all these horrors. As a full time student at a large public university, a veteran, and only in about 8K personal credit card debt, I’m trying to raise my personal score above 600 again and get it closer to 700 for things I can plan for down the road like a better vehicle, renting or moving into or building a dream home someday, maybe furthering my business plans with loans if necessary. At this stage in my life, I went to give back and help, being selfless as I can to easy these times of worry if I can, especially with dad turning 66 in a couple weeks. There seems to be options, so are there resources available that you know could help or that I should explore to help get this issue sorted out about losing the house and where to start (with the lien, debt owed, and taxes)? My dad doesn’t talk about it with me, like ever, I heard small scared and mentions of fear like this growing up but we always made it through somehow and life kept on. Now it seems more threatening, my brother said he may lie and tell them dads sick to hope the persons in charge will have an understanding and waive more time?? I feel there are better ways to handle this and I need some insight on how to approach this all. I feel like I am very resourceful currently at this point, just breaking the ice now with consulting you all for prioritization. Should I put house in my name somehow, like get a 0% down VA home loan to buy it? Get any loan to pay off taxes and he pay me back? Don’t insurance companies give loans somehow? Should I help him work while I’m taking online classes due to school being out and just give all my money to him? Should i focus on my credit card debt and continue to get my finances in order first before I get into an icky position? I need to understand the situation better so I will plan to talk with him soon. 

TL;DR
Dad skipped taxes in earlier years, lean now on house, about $12000 owed in a couple months or house gone. Veteran here, and student trying to figure out a plan of action to help. What direct or indirect resources should I explore to help avoid the crash and burn?",8,1585290235,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fps1a5/dad_may_lose_house_to_the_state_or_bank_by_having/,personalfinance,1
fps0wd,chrischrischrischri,How do I go about keeping my grandfathers house once he goes? (Reverse mortgage),"I honestly dont even want to think about it at the moment but I am going to have to prepare for the future now. 

My grandfather had 500k cash on hand from money he came across in 2014 and this current house paid off in full. Everything was going fine until late 2018 when I was made aware that he ran out of money and was doing a reverse mortgage. 

I have a strong suspicion someone was stealing money from him. But I am not going to go into that right now. 

It's been a little over a year since he took our the reverse mortgage and he has already taken out 200 thousand dollars. Either I am not understanding something or someone is taking advantage of him. 

Anyways I was supposed to get the house but as you all know with a reverse mortgage you have 6 months to pay the loan off in full or the bank gets the house. 

He will be able to take out another 180k and I am hoping that gets me another year here, but once he goes how do I go about saving the house? It would be incredibly foolish to sell the house and I would never be able to buy another house in this area. And I love this area. 


Would I be able to mortgage the house and pay it off that way? The house itself is worth like 900k (really probably around 1.2 but the bank only valued it at 900k) 

I have had screaming matches with my mother because (unless I am misunderstanding something) there is no way my grandfather has spent 200k in a years time. The cost of living in my area is high. But not that high. 


Really I'm just asking how to pay it off.",5,1585290173,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fps0wd/how_do_i_go_about_keeping_my_grandfathers_house/,personalfinance,1
fprx4a,ABenson20,Student loans are in default. Lost work due to budget issues in January. Anything I can do to make my refund not go straight to my federal loans?,"Hi.

I have about 50K in student debt and was terminated (I didnt quit) January 1st because the department I worked for had budget issues (non corona related). My Federal Loans are in default right now and I am really in a whole. I'm worried any refund I will get will go straight to the federal loan.

I worked from January until now as a self-employed personal trainer, but all the gyms are closed, so I am out of work. I can't coach anyone. I never collected receipts from my clients and they always paid me cash or venmo because I didn't charge much.

So I have 2 questions:

1.) Am I able to apply for unemplyment for either or my two job terminations? I am in Texas  
2.) Is there something I can do to my default student loan to make sure I get my usual refund? Can I start a income-based repayment, do my taxes, and be set?

I'm worried I am going to dig myself in just a bigger financial hole especially with rent coming up. There is just no work. I try everyday.",3,1585289621,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fprx4a/student_loans_are_in_default_lost_work_due_to/,personalfinance,1
fprvzb,morgan1215,Moving out and/or paying off my car?,"I currently owe a little over $18000 on my car. I also have $6000 in the bank right now. As a college student i am currently making about $2000 a month ($3400 for the next two or three due to picking up shifts). I live with my parents so I don’t pay rent. My bills are: $315 for car and $195 for phone and car insurance. 

I am planning on moving to a city about 50ish minutes away in the future. I am doing a 4 month internship in the city from September - December. I also plan to go to transfer to a school there in January 2021. I also plan to get a job there since the job opportunities here in my preferred field are few and far in between. But the problem is that the new job would be a huge drop in pay as I would be switching fields and am inexperienced (I make $18 now working every weekend and it would go to probably $12 if I am lucky) 

So what I am debating on is should I pay off my car (which I could do my January) and then move out and just drive up there for the four months of the internship or should I just move out right before the internship in September and possibly struggle to pay bills due to having rent and car payment?

fprv0c,brcnz,New Zealand Citizen Living in Australia Emigrating to the United States - Superannuation/Tax/Planning for a life in the U.S. Questions,"Hello r/personalfinance, 

I am New Zealand Citizen, living in Australia and (was) planning on emigrating to the United States sometime this month. Due to the current state of the world, this move has been delayed indefinitely, and I now find myself in a position where I am unsure of how I should proceed. I have a few questions, and while I have been working my way through the personal finance Wiki's and Kahn Academy courses on taxation in the U.S., I have a couple more niche questions. I appreciate this is a bit of a write up.

The original plan was to resign from my job as a Geologist here in Australia on April 1st before travelling back to New Zealand and onto the United Kingdom to see family, before trying to establish myself in the United States. I had a couple of leads on jobs in the U.S., and had saved approximately $15,000 AUD to allow me to travel and establish myself in the U.S. This plan was mostly concrete, so I handed in my resignation at the end of last year with this timeline in mind. Fast forward a a couple of months to last week, and with borders closing across the world, I decided cancelling travels would be wise, no harm no foul. I did however have a deadline to enter the U.S. by early June, to 'activate' my legal permanent residence status, so booked a very  last minute in and out trip to Hawaii to finish the D.V/Green-card lottery process. Today marks my one week anniversary as an LPR of the USA. 

The rough plan at this stage was to try and extend my tenure at my current job in Australia (great relationship with employer), however, as this was very close to my original resignation date, the new starter had begun the on-boarding process and I was unable to stay. Thats fine, I accept that. The next plan was to pick up some temp work in a different department for a few months, before re-evaluating a move to the states (I also accept a few months is very optimistic). First question, if this were to eventuate, what is the story with taxes? AUS income is automatically taxed, but do I just keep a record of my earnings whilst i'm in Australia and then sort this out with an accountant when I am in the U.S.? I understand all international income while you are a U.S. LPR/Citizen is subject to tax? Is this correct? Could anyone point me in the best direction to wrap my head around this? COVID-19 has meant all forecast work with my previous organisation has been suspended for two months, and I am realistic that it is not looking like I will be able to pick up work in my field at the moment, but if I do manage to find something or pick up another temp job I would like to know how to navigate this situation. 

Secondly, the Australian Government has announced those unemployed can access up to $10,000 AUD tax free from their superannuation funds. Currently, I have just over $10,000 in my Australian super fund, \~$12,000 AUD saved for the move, approximately \~2.5K in shares in N.Z., \~$8,000 NZD in my Kiwisaver (gov. managed superannuation). I am wondering if it is worth withdrawing this $10,000 from my Australian super whilst I can to bolster a house deposit, as typically this fund is explicitly for retirement, not for retirement or first home deposit like Kiwisaver in NZ. 

Currently, I have absolutley no idea where I would want to buy, and I don't anticipate buying a house in the next few years (would like to live in the states for a bit, see if it's for me, then decide where to buy). My question on this matter is, is it worth ""stripping the tree today to enjoy fruit this week"", or should I leave this in Australia growing for retirement? If i do withdraw this money from my Aus superannuation, is it subject to taxation as I am a U.S. resident? Likewise are any dividends (lol atm) or potential eventual sale on my NZ shares subject to U.S. taxes? 

ATM I don't really know how to proceed, and appreciate no one really does. I am thinking its wise to stay in AUS where I have healthcare, and a \*potential\* job lead? Currently I have minimal expenses ($180 AUD a week in rent), so can definitely live off my savings for a while. The AUD --&gt; USD is also brutal at the moment, and job prospects in the U.S. seem like they'll be tough/non existent. I understand however it is much easier to enter back into the U.S. within 6 months of initial entry, and that I have at most a year out of the USA before I am considered to have abandoned my LPR status. 

I definitely understand the haziness of my situation and will be consulting a U.S. accountant when I am in the U.S., but would like to understand a little more about how being a multinational works. 

I appreciate anyone who managed to work through the worlds longest read, and appreciate any advice or tidbits on offer.",2,1585289323,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fprv0c/new_zealand_citizen_living_in_australia/,personalfinance,1

fprn5b,Dawgawnet,Feeling hopeless. How do I un**** myself,"Throwaway acct. If this isn't allowed, please delete, but I'm not sure where else to go. I can't afford professional advice.

Im 33. College educated. For about 5 years I was an independent contractor. I was (am) severely depressed, and hated my job. After saying I was going to quit for about 3 years, I finally quit about 3 months ago. No other real plan, just felt like I had to or I never would. I also knew I needed to find a job with benefits so I could get some help with my depression/mental health. Even though my job was decent, I was living paycheck to paycheck. I didn't budget and didn't file my tax returns for several years because I knew I couldn't pay what I owed. Thinking about it made me anxious, and more depressed, so I just avoided it altogether. 

My plan until I found a job I thought I might suit me better was to drive uber. Though I knew it wouldn't solve my financial problems, and I would have to live on a tight budget, I actually kind of enjoyed the job itself compared to my previous, better paying work.

Now the cornoa virus becomes a thing and turns the world upside down (an unfortunate event, after a series of bad moves by me). Now, I'm still driving uber, but it's extremely slow, also I know I'm putting myself at risk by driving strangers all day, but I have no choice. I have to have some money coming in to try and pay my bills. Because I haven't filed a tax return in several years, my understanding is that I won't be getting a stimulus check, so I'm not sure I'll be able to pay my bills. If my state locks down, I certainly won't be able to. 

I have heard that if I file a 2019 tax return now, I may get a check for assistance, but I'm afraid that will cause other problems (which I will eventually have to face one way or another), however I own a house with someone else and if the bank or IRS comes after that house I won't be able to live with myself. I don't know what my current credit score is, but I have racked up quite a bit of cc debt since buying the house 7 years ago.

Any honest advice is much appreciated. I know I've made a lot of mistakes. I want to get on track. I also don't want to be homeless. Where should I start? Or if I'm actually as **cked as I feel, how do i disappear?

Not only am I concerned it will still not be safe to travel by late May, we also have concerns over whether or not our hotel reservation will still exist at that point in time.


 I received an email two days ago that my return flight has been moved from 9pm on Wednesday to 7am on Thursday. Even though I bought the most basic ticket possible, JetBlue’s policy clearly read that I would be entitled to a cash refund if my flight was changed by more than two hours. Even if the panic over the virus is over by this date, this time will not work as I would end up missing work on Thursday.


I have not acknowledged this change to my itinerary, and was having trouble accessing my booking online so I called JetBlue to try and cancel. I was told that a new policy was put in place on March 18th that is eliminating cash refunds unless your flight is moved by more than 24 hours, and that the best they could do would be to give me a travel voucher.


I am not interested in this voucher. I can appreciate that the industry is hurting, but I purchased my ticket nearly two weeks before this rule was put into place. It feels ridiculous to me that (sidenote) just because they spent all their money on share buyback over the last five years I need to help keep them afloat. I have bills to pay as well, and am not interested in floating a significant amount of money to a corporation during a time like this. I’m sure all airlines are doing this, but I’m not interested in giving JetBlue my money moving forward.

This is my first post on [r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/),  I hope y'all are doing well. Due to quarantine-related boredom I  decided to do my own taxes using CreditKarma. This is proving to be more  complicated than I thought. I might need to see a tax professional  after all, but we'll see.

For  context, I work full time / am a student part-time and my employer pays  100% of my tuition. They sent me a 1098-T with the following:

1.) Box 1 has my total tuition they paid.

2.)  Box 5 lists a few thousand in scholarships or grants. No idea what  scholarships or grants they gave me, but I won't question it.

What  do I do with this information? It doesn't seem like I qualify for any  education credits because I did not spend any of my own money on this,  and my wages on my W-2 are above the 85k limit for eligibility for these  things anyway. I also believe the tuition benefit is considered a  fringe benefit, so I would not be eligible for any further credits. Not  sure what to do with the scholarship amount, though.

fpr8o9,locusofself,Debating a relocation to HCOL for a new job,"Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

I currently live in Spokane, WA  with my wife and 15 month old daughter.  We own a house here we bought for $300,000 and with a lucky refinance we got out of PMI and our payment is $1598/month. We owe 267,000 on the house, we only bought it 1.5 years ago putting 10% down. I make about 150k per year gross, wife makes about 50k passively from music royalties.  I pay $6k for health insurance and have no 401k match etc.

I've been offered a job at Microsoft in Redmond, WA.  The compensation package is complicated, but with average bonuses, stock, 401k match, no-cost benefits, etc, the compensation is going to gross me at least 60-70k more per year.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out what my difference in net worth in say 4 years might be if I take this job. The cost of housing around Microsoft is about 3-4x where I live now,  and I don't think buying a house for $1m+ would be a very responsible thing to do in the first year or so of working there.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we could probably sell our house and pocket 50-60k because of appreciation. But I'd hate to only have 5-10% down on an expensive house in that area and be back to paying PMI etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we could rent something suitable for around $3,000 per month for a year and then buy a house over there if all is going well.

&amp;#x200B;

Theres just a lot of factors here and I'm wondering if anyone has ideas/guidance on how to help quantify this. Am I missing anything? Should I just do my best to graph out both scenarios?

fpr7n3,beepbooplazer,"I received a 1098-T from my employer, who pays my graduate tuition. I also have some other scholarships. I am completely confused by what I am supposed to do with this.","Hi everyone,

This is my first post on r/personalfinance, I hope y'all are doing well. Due to quarantine-related boredom I decided to do my own taxes using CreditKarma. This is proving to be more complicated than I thought. I might need to see a tax professional after all, but we'll see.

For context, I work full time / am a student part-time and my employer pays 100% of my tuition. They sent me a 1098-T with the following:

1.) Box 1 has my total tuition they paid.

2.) Box 5 lists a few thousand in scholarships or grants. No idea what scholarships or grants they gave me, but I won't question it.

What do I do with this information? It doesn't seem like I qualify for any education credits because I did not spend any of my own money on this, and my wages on my W-2 are above the 85k limit for eligibility for these things anyway. I also believe the tuition benefit is considered a fringe benefit, so I would not be eligible for any further credits. Not sure what to do with the scholarship amount, though.

Sorry for the stupid question. I have never done my own taxes before.",1,1585286053,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpr7n3/i_received_a_1098t_from_my_employer_who_pays_my/,personalfinance,1

fpr5pi,book_burning_witch,Small question on what to do with savings.,"Hi all,
I am thankfully not yet affected by the pandemic, I'm able to still regularly contribute to my 401k at around 11% of my check with a match from my employer. Outside of that I have a substantial amount in a savings account just sitting there, I was planning on buying a house soon which is why I haven't further invested it. I'm only 26 so I'm not terribly concerned with the losses occurred on my 401, assuming something apocalyptic doesn't happen hopefully it'll be looking healthier in 40 years. 

My question is; in this somewhat turbulent time would it be best for me to just let that money in my savings account rest there In case I need it if things get real dire? I'm not sure how a (hypothetically) crashed to hell market would affect the value of the money stored in that account. Essentially I don't want to be making a mistake by not moving it somewhere safer if such a place exists for it.

Capital one allowed me a 30-day deferment. No payments, no late charge, no interest accrual. I was advised that I could do a further requests in 30 days if the situation was the same. Customer service answered very quickly and was extremely cordial.

With this new bill, you can withdrawal money from your 401(k) and not get hit with the 10% early penalty. Since you have to still pay income tax on it wether its now or when your retired and take it out (ie: 70), why wouldn't you use this opportunity to take it out of the 401(k) and into a regular investment account, effectively just making you more liquid and unchaining you from the bounds of a 401(k)? 

What am I missing, what other negatives are there? F'

From what I understand, the only difference is paying income tax now vs later ( dependent on your tax bracket of course, but for this exercise, lets say you are in the same tax bracket )....

Using my example why else wouldn't I do take out all my money from my 401(k) and put right back in to the same ETFs?

I am looking for a way to maximize my wife and I's retirement savings. 

I currently make about $65K/year between 3 jobs (1 full time salary, 2 part-time hourly/tips) and DO NOT have an employer sponsored retirement plan available to me. My wife is in medical school and brings in about 10K/year from a part time job. Also no employer sponsored retirement plan available to her. We file jointly at tax time.

I max out my Roth IRA, and I am hoping to open one in her name and also max that one out to double our savings. My concern is that everything I read about doing this refers to one working spouse and one non-working spouse. I don't want to run into any problems come tax season because my wife does earn some income.

Am I in the clear to simply open a Roth in her name through the same servicer I use for my Roth and tie my bank account to her new IRA to fund it?

\*\*\*Bonus Question: We have our emergency fund set up in a HYSA (\~12K for 8 months of living) plus a few laddered CDs for short-term savings for a house. We have no debt other then my wife's medical school debt - she graduates in May 2021. I have about $25K left over in cash right now that isn't doing anything for me.

I just started a new well-paying job last week after leaving my previous job at the end of last year, and my current question is a good problem to have, especially compared to what others are going through.

Background: I have a significant amount of student loan debt (all federal) from going to business school. I also have an outstanding car loan (2.9%). My wife and I have a sizable emergency fund saved up and no accumulated credit card debt. I am only eligible for my new job's 401(k) after 6 months. Because I was not working the first few months of the year and a significant chunk of my new job's compensation is variable we will be under the Roth IRA income limits this year but probably not next year. 

My question then is this: what should I do for the next 6 months while student loan payments are deferred and I'm not eligible for my company's 401(k)? Should I throw everything I would have been putting into the 401(k), adjusted for taxes, at the student loans so the principal is lower once interest kicks back in? Should I put the money toward a Roth IRA since I'll be under the income limits and the market is likely to make a decent recovery? Or should I forego the investing and student loan payments and target the car loan?

fppw9s,MyDay2Day,"Day after closing, many condo issues","I closed on this condo yesterday, and today was my first day spending time in it. The floor is incredibly sloped which is something I didn’t notice the extent of and I could probably live with it. The brand new appliances have issues, pulled the oven open and one side came off... ok. I can probably fix this. There was no washer and dryer in the unit when I did my walkthrough and had adding them as part of the contract. They added them, not the brand that was in the contract, but they added them. 

Fast forward to tonight, first night in the place. The drain in the washer and dryer room overflowed pointing some water on the floor, but it was not a lot of standing water before we noticed this. The drain seems to be backed up and can only handle so much. The dishwasher also is not draining for some reason. I have not yet checked to see if they did not remove the plug in a new garbage disposal. This unit is a complete renovation, maybe I should have started with that. 

I got a knock on my door a few minutes ago and apparently the two units down from me got water from above. First day after closing... This was a VA loan and as such I had an inspection performed, and it also appraised above the purchase price (I’m sure they game this part). I understand I should have done more due diligence but I’ve been commuting an hour and a half or so each way for this new job, and I am just wondering what options I might have if any?

fpprqv,daverozy,1098-T Form Help!! (TurboTax),"Before I filled out my 1098-T form, TurboTax said I was going to receive roughly $1000 back for my federal and state taxes. After I entered the form, TurboTax says I now owe about $500 for federal taxes and $150 for state.

I tried to find some more answers online about what is going on. Apparently, if the scholarship amount (box 5) is greater than the payments received (box 1), then it is counted as taxable income. However, the box 5 amount was smaller than the box 1 amount by a lot. That means all of the scholarships that my school gave me go directly towards tuition, and I still pay the rest with my own money  every semester.

How can they count my scholarship as taxable income when it is not being used that way?

I read that you don't necessarily need to file the 1098-T form if your box 5 amount is less than the box 1 amount. Now I am strongly considering doing this because I shouldn't owe any money.

I'm finally take this subs true advice and I'm going to try to build to 3 of the recommended 6 months of savings. I'm not near that amount but I'm ready to take the first step and push $2,000 into my money market account instead of spending it on a whole house water filtration system (definitely don't need it, just always wanted it).

I went through the song and dance of trying to get the accounts set up through BofA only to find out that the transfers will cost me $3 minimum. Considering I want to make this an account where I periodically dump money (not regularly so direct deposit won't work for me) I feel like this surcharge is going to defeat the whole purpose of trying to put the money in a high(er) yield savings account.

Is there any way for me to set up this for a free transfer short of taking a check to my credit union? I have been considering setting up a second cash app account that is linked to my credit union account but figured I ask you professionals first.

fpol2v,Deathpanda15,19 and likely living on my own within a month.,"Hello all,
Like the title says, I’m 19 and I’m likely going to end up living on my own within a month. Now there’s not too much about that that’s overtly special, but I could really use some advice. 

To answer some questions before they are asked:

I currently am not living with my parents. I’m living with my aunt and uncle in Iowa. My parents are in California. 

My parents have offered to fly me back out to California, but I do not think that that’s a wise decision at this time seeing as I have a job here in Iowa that pays decently well and is considered essential so I’ll still be able to work during the whole coronavirus mess. I think that holding onto this job is going to prove to be very important in the coming months which is why I think I should stay in Iowa.

I work part-time for $15/hr with the incentive of extra pay depending on how quickly I work. I should be able to move to full-time sometime soon.

My parents have offered to help me pay rent/expenses, but we have not discussed exactly how much money they are willing to provide.

Now that those are out of the way...

I moved to Iowa in late January (really just to build a relationship with a part of my family that I didn’t get to see very often). I was only recently able to start working, which is to say that I started this week. Now, I don’t really want to move out and live on my own, but my aunt and uncle are taking a hit financially (as are many people) and are being forced to look at moving into a smaller house without space for extra people because of it. I’ve found a few apartments that I think will be relatively affordable, but I don’t really know much when it comes to this kind of thing.

The biggest problems I see are with actually getting accepted as a tenant. I don’t have a credit history because I’ve never owned a credit card. I personally don’t have the resources to pay a deposit up front (though that may change). The only thing I can really promise to the landlord or lease agency is that I will be able to make rent on time every month. And I wouldn’t be able to do that with excessive extra income, just a few hundred dollars at most.

Is there an avenue that I need to explore as far as applying for an apartment that would help my chances of getting accepted? As far as expenses go, what areas can I save in and how? The lowest I’ve seen an apartment go for in the area I’m in is ~$550/mo, is there any way to negotiate the rent to be a bit lower than that? How should I go about doing that? I don’t mind committing to a long-term lease, but I’d prefer to keep my contract short-term so that I’m not nailed down here if I need to - or choose to - move, is there anything that I should be aware of in that regard?

fpoabr,neekhenny1201,"Parents claimed me after I said not to, can I still get a stimulus check?","Not sure if this is even the right sub to post this in. But basically, I filed before my parents did this year. I claimed myself, then they filed and claimed me too. Their return originally got rejected because of this. But they sent my W9’s to their accountant who somehow fixed this. 
For context, I turned 18 on January 12th of 2019. So basically when 2019 started, I was still a child for 12 days. I think they used this loophole to claim me, even though I wasn’t living with them before I was 18. I only moved back in with them in December, so technically I only lived with them or relied on them supporting me for one or 2 months of last year. 
I’ve read that dependents don’t get a check, and people who claim them only get the $500 for them if they’re under 18. 
Does this essentially mean that even though I’m now 19, working, fully supporting myself and even filed a return this year, I got fucked over by their accountant and am now ineligible for my stimulus check?

fpo0u4,Thanith,Lender Mistake on Mortgage Loan Estimate,"My spouse and I received a loan estimate from a lender and put in an offer on a home.  The offer was accepted, we've already done an inspection and have submitted insurance information and a request for an appraisal.  On the day our option runs out, our lender has told us that we actually do not qualify for down payment assistance (TSAHC) because of income (we're about $3,000 short or so).  We were doing a conventional with seller assistance along with the down payment because FHA wasn't an option (my student loans are too high, on a income driven repayment plan).  

To say we are devastated would be an understatement.  We have enough money for the estimated costs with a little bit of a buffer, which is why we were doing this to begin with.  But definitely not enough without the down payment.  

Are there any other options that w should be looking at other than TSAHC or TDHCA?  We're just at a total loss.",8,1585272412,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpo0u4/lender_mistake_on_mortgage_loan_estimate/,personalfinance,1

fpnzew,accuratemm,Warning for those looking for loans.. TLDR - Beware of LendingTree,"Hi all,

I figured this is relevant in this community with the current economic climate.. i imagine people will be looking into loans and whatnot. 

Things have turned upside down for me/family and I needed a personal loan to assist with certain matters. I turned to LendingTree as i've seen it advertised here and there. 

1) The process was quick and easy, input your personal information and they generate a quote for you. I found a decent loan package with appropriate APR.

2) Literally within 90 seconds of creating my account, i received numerous calls barraging my phone.. from various states.

3) I am now receiving a flood of emails from a string of lenders.

4) Some of these lenders lure you into their websites and force you to keep punching more and more of your information until you can get an actual confirmation on your loan quote. Often they'll keep the true APR to your loan until the end.. after you've committed to typing in so much information. At this point, what's 6% vs 7%? right.

I am certain that my personal information has been blasted to hundreds of companies. I'm expecting a massive dump of snail mail at my front door next week.

I am writing this to, hopefully, spare you of misery/abuse especially in such a vulnerable time.

I'm living in Europe, and as a student (18+), my bank refuses to let me use a debit card because I do not have a steady income of at least 1000€ a month. With that out of the way: I can only ever see myself using a Mastercard to pay for stuff on amazon.com and Kickstarter, where there is no other payment option, and I think that I may not be the only one facing that issue. Hence the question: Has one of you run into the same issue and found a good solution? I want to avoid 'hidden' fees at all cost. Ideally, it would be a prepaid card with no fees for putting money on the card and no fees for using it to pay online, only a low monthly/yearly fee. Not sure how it works, but the currency exchange rate shouldn't be scammy either. It does not matter at all how much if is for ATM withdrawal and so on.

I just opened a Schwab Investor Checking account because I hope to travel a lot in a few years and they don't charge foreign transaction fees, plus they reimburse all ATM fees world wide. However their interest rate is only 0.03%. And even their savings account is only 0.05%.

So I'm looking at saving's accounts with Ally, and Capital One 360 Performance Savings. And that's what I'd like advice on. They both offer 1.50% APY.

I have a Capital One Quicksilver credit card. Does that make Capital One a better option? It also matters to me how easy it is to open the saving's account. For example Schwab requires a physical application! I'd much prefer to apply online. 

Is it easy to transfer money between Ally or Capital One 360 Performance Savings and Schwab?

fpn4ln,Nitro-Nito,Refinancing/Consolidate Student Loans,"A family member is considering refinancing/consolidating their student loans, so that they can have lower monthly payments (and hopefully lower interest rates).

They have several private loans, some of which are variable interest, and also several federal loans.

We've tried researching the best approaches toward paying their debt, and we understand the idea of paying off the highest-interest loans first, but we saw conflicting recommendations when it came to consolidation/refinancing...

* Some say to only refinance/consolidate the lowest variable interest rate loans
* Some say to refinance *all* variable rate loans
* Some say to refinance the highest interest loans, *regardless* if they're variable or fixed interest
* Some say to just try refinancing all private loans overall

This makes it confusing when trying to apply for consolidation/refinance loans, as they usually ask what your loan amounts are and your monthly payments. We're unsure if we should be putting the total for *all* loans (not just ones we wish to refinance), or specific ones, etc, nor are we sure which ones specifically to refinance for.

Is there any advice or clarification anyone here can offer?

Here's a breakdown of all their loans, grouped by the three providers they make their monthly payments to. Variable rate loans are italicized.

Our most recent escrow analysis shows the company is still using the 2018 tax amount to estimate our contributions. *We are now $7.5k in the red as a result of this miscalculation.* We love in the Bay Area, housing prices and property taxes are insane. I have already been on the phone with them for 2 hours and have gotten absolutely nowhere. 

I have many, many questions, but my primary question is this: we provided the escrow company with our updated tax documents. It is their job to calculate our monthly escrow payment based on our tax estimates, and insurance. They did not do their job. Are my husband and I legally on the hook for this entire negative balance? It seems  like since it was company error or negligence, they should be responsible for the difference between the 2018 property taxes and the 2019 property taxes.",11,1585268828,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpn3fw/escrow_amount_not_adjusted_for_increased_taxes/,personalfinance,1

Everyone I know is in the same situation because they're on the hook for the next 5 months of rent and don't have anyone to sublet to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been unemployed for the past 3 months with my licence suspended for the past month. I was relying on the states for unemployment benefits and food stamps while searching for a job, but my luck has run out and I need money.  So I decided to go for postmates. But here is where I need help. Iam overdrawn by $500 in my checking account. Technically I can only go up to 400, but bills and fees added it up. With that being said, What ever I make with postmates (im not expecting much tbh), I still wont be able to use the money until I made about $200. My situation is, I need gas as well as groceries. I wanted to have the money deposited to my cash card so I can use it right away, but after some research, it seems that wont work. People were recommending Chime. I only recently started hearing about them and sounded good. But too good to be true. So I decided to do researching, their subreddit is small and many people seem to dislike them, mainly because the deposit doesnt hit on time. Someone said they were going to Capital One, and they look nice, except for the overdraft options where none of the options sound nice to me. 

Currently with my credit union bank, Im charged $31 each time I make a purchase while overdrafted. Or if I had money in my savings, they will take it out of there. Neither do I like. With a bank I do want no minimum balance, no over draft fees, no monthly or annual fees, and a high interest rate savings. Not required but would be nice is, early deposit and a bank I can use with any atm with no fees.

fpmdpv,Amoura39,Looking for A Daily Spending Limit,"I am an 18 year who works at a grocery store stocking shelves.
I work generally 4 days, 6 hours each, every single week. I make about $240 on average, at a rate of $10/hour. 

I do not pay any bills. I do not drive, I do not pay for gas -- my mother completely supports my transportation needs. I do not pay rent; I do not pay for water, electric, gas or temperature maintenance. I currently am completely provided for, in terms of nourishment as well as insurances and general life funds, by my mother.

My mom wants me to save my money so I can eventually buy a car. Thus, I don't carelessly spend it.
However, this does not mean I spend it only when needed. I spend about $4 every day I work minimum, for breakfast. For lunch, I'm likely to spend $8 or $1~2 (depending on whether I have mac &amp; cheese or a Gatorade). Then, I have $5 after work for ice cream OR $8 for mac &amp; cheese.

My breakfast almost always costs around $4. I eat it four days a week for a total of $16 for breakfast each week. 
Assuming I have mac &amp; cheese for lunch, half of the time, and 1 or two Gatorades for the other half... (8*2)+(1)+(2): A total of $19 for lunch each week.
Then, for my end, I likely have ice cream 3/4s of the after-work times... (5*3)+8: a total of $23 in afterwork snacks.

Every week, once, I may buy some snacks for myself at home. These can cost from $10 if I keep it light or or about $15 if things catch my eye too much. I spend about $13 buying groceries for myself.


Upon actually intensively thinking about this stuff... how much I really do spend... I'm quite embarrassed. But, I suppose that's good because that could result in a positive change.

Based on this info, I spend about 16+19+23+13: I spend about $71 out of about $240 in a single week... Oh my God, I really didn't know it was so much...

That brings me to my next point... The reason for this title. Based on my income, my age, my COMPLETE LACK OF BILLS TO PAY IN EVERY WAY, I would suggestions as to a good spending limit for every day ('You may not spend more than x amount in a single day""). 

I would like a mature concept of fun to be factored in -- take account of my age and decide how much fun, how foolishly I am allowed to use my money in a given day, if at all -- but be mature about it: just because I'm a new adult doesn't mean I want to be told ""oh yeah, just spend it all -- enjoy yerself kiddo :3."" 

I want to be able to feel a responsible touch of control over my money but I want to enjoy life, too.

My mom wants me to save it, ultimately,  but has approved me to buy multiple little things along the way I've wanted -- without any issues. It would feel somewhat wrong of me to buy something big... to fully let myself have the unnecessary things I want. 

But, I want a way to get the things I want. I intend to use this daily limit as though it were a daily allowance from a third party for me to meet my needs -- that which I don't use becomes my own personal money to do whatever with. Over multiple days of not hitting this supposed limit, my leftovers will add up. This will teach me to moderate my money while providing a reward and sense of freedom.

...Anyway, I don't know what else to say. Please tell me based on my age -- its leeway, my circumstances -- unbilled and making $240 a week and my goal -- to enjoy a balance between work and play... what your suggested 'daily spending limit would be.'",8,1585266182,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpmdpv/looking_for_a_daily_spending_limit/,personalfinance,1

fplwp5,Athrun360,Refinance home mortgage thoughts?,"Hi, i need some thoughts regarding this refinance offer. My initial thought is no dont do it. Let me know what you think.

Estimated value of house: $275000

**Current loan**
Balance: $225000
Interest: 3.875%
Term: 30 years (been paying for 3.5 years)
Monthly: $1700

**Offer**
Balance: $231000
Interest: 3.875%
Term: 30 years
Monthly: $1550

Goal is to lower interest rate and payment. Didn’t mind resetting the loan term back to 30 years as well (personal reason)

Minimal closing cost like $500 because he’s adding them into the loan which i did not like. His selling point was he’s able to get rid of my pmi with this offer ($90 a month) and no appraisal fee.

fplcwh,jdjgelato,“Essentially” Screwed,"Make 101% of my income by quitting?

Background: I’m an “essential” chemist with a bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry working in Biotech. I magically make about 54k due to the wonderfully flawed system of income as that’s my value acc to the world. 

The unemployment for California is 450/week. The new additional unemployment is 600/week. I currently make 1038$/week but the unemployment benefit would allow me to earn 1050/week by staying home. I am coming to work effectively to lose money while making “essential” medical supplies. 

Don’t get me wrong, I make okay money. I am a bit confused how I could actually make more money by not having a job versus being “ESSENTIAL”. 

Summation: I am mandated to work 40 hours to earn negative 12$ each week during this period.   “Essential” lies. Fuck this system

I know, I know. It’s supposed to be a system for those that need it. But come on. I actually have to “take the risk” everyday by working and continuing on as if it’s all normal. AKA “hazard pay situations”. Others at this company get to work from home because it’s deemed ‘safer’. At least I qualify for the 1200$ check. I guess that’ll make up for the -30% return on my 401k and investment portfolio of 0$ and 25k student loans. 

Side question. Is there a way to qualify for unemployment by leaving a job. Maybe health concerns? Doubtful. Definitely asking for a friend....",18,1585262480,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fplcwh/essentially_screwed/,personalfinance,1

PNC Bank - Seemingly good deal b/c they have no branches in my state, but only 1.25% APY on their website

Consumers Credit Union Checking Account - Crazy high APY if you meet the requirements, but I'm not sure I will

One of those accounts has gone negative ($26.04) and USAA closed that account, and has now restricted my other accounts, so I’m unable to withdraw money or anything like that. I have the funds needed to pay off the charge off amount, but according to USAA, there’s only 2 ways to clear the balance: a wire transfer from another bank or mailing a check/money order. 

Mailing the check will result in it taking about 20-30 buisness days total from sending it out to them receiving and processing it. 

I want to do a wire transfer, but the only problem is all my money is in one of my USAA accounts and I can’t withdraw money. I was thinking of trying to transfer the funds into a PayPal account, withdrawing the funds, depositing them into an account I have with another bank (that I’ve only got like a few bucks in) and then wire transferring it from there.

**The Student Emergency Fund can be used to assist students with situations such as:**

Accidents, student illness, illness or death of a family member,  vandalism, theft (e.g., apartment break-ins), natural disasters, and / or unexpected changes in financial circumstances.

**Typical expenses eligible for such assistance may include, but are not limited to:**

Living expenses including housing costs, utilities, food, etc. Travel costs related to the severe illness or death of a family member. Medical expenses not covered by insurance including medications, delinquent bills, other costs related to medical area. Books and other essential academic expenses, or replacement of essential personal belongings due to theft, fire, or natural disaster. Safety needs.

**In addition to providing sufficient documentation of the emergency situation and resulting financial hardship, students must meet the following criteria:**

Be a registered, degree-seeking  student, enrolled in at least 6 units. Have not received emergency funds in the same academic year. Have exhausted all University financial aid offers, including loan offers and work study.Have considered all other possible resources and determined none are available or sufficient.

I am interested in applying for this, with everything going on right now. I am currently still working my job which I am extremely grateful for, however my hours have been cut by almost half, and we are taking things day by day as to if we are going to shut down or not. If we do end up temporarily closing, we do not know if we will still be paid or not. I do still receive some financial support from my parents, but they are in the same boat with their business, not knowing if they will be temporarily shutting down or not. I pay most of my own rent for my apartment, pay my own utilities, groceries, etc., and am using loans to pay for school. I go to a university 2 hours away from my home town, and living in student housing which it is either live here and pay my rent, or move home and still pay my rent, which is the main reason I have not moved home since I am still expected to pay my rent here. The student apartments are not reducing any rent at this time, nor are they giving any financial help; we are still responsible for the full rent amounts during all of this whether we can afford it or not,  employed or unemployed, staying at school or moving home.  The main question that is puzzling me is that it is asking for an exact amount of how much I want to request; would 2 months worth of rent be sufficient enough/appropriate in this case? Asking for advice on whether I seem to have a good enough case to apply for this, or if it just isn't worth it. I never knew that universities had things like this, so I am just now finding out about everything and would love some insight and help.

fpkntk,swaglar,401(k) Contributions: How much should I put in?,"Hello everyone,

I am u/swaglar and I recently started a full-time position (lucky me, they stopped all hiring just a week after I started). I have benefits and one of those is a 401(k) account through Fidelity, which I am currently in the process of setting up. My company matches 4% of my contributions, and so I was thinking I would just contribute 4%. However, after doing some googling and whatnot, I see that it is recommended to save at least 10-15% of your contributions each pay period. Now, I am more than willing to save that much per pay period, but I was wondering if I really need to put that much into my Fidelity account? I really want to just get my match and then invest however much I have left over after any expenses on my own through Robinhood and Stash.

I guess my question is, is there a benefit to contributing more to one of these accounts, rather than putting more money into my personal investments in Robinhood and Stash? The Fidelity account looks like it invests into a JP Morgan 2060 Fund if that makes any difference. Also it says pre-tax, so will I get a bigger tax break for contributing more? I just like the idea of having more control over what I would like to invest in. Any advice or experiences would help!

Any other time, I would have put my money on my mortgage as the rate of interest is high. But, now with the beer virus situation and the  S&amp;P 500 crashing would it be a sound idea to put that amount in the market?

fpkk9f,ramblinwreck11,"Dad left my sister and I with 401k money after his death. He had no beneficiaries listed, so all money was sent to his wife, who is a heavy alcoholic and financially illiterate.","Hi all, I am in a bit of a frustrating situation that I am hoping someone might be able to help with.

**Background**:

My dad unfortunately lost his battle with cancer in mid-February of this year. My sister and I found out that he had left 50% of his 401k balance to be split between the two of us, with the other 50% going to his wife. My dad, as amazing of a man as he is, did tend to hold off on important affairs until very last minute, and among other things we learned that he didn’t leave anyone as beneficiaries on his 401k.

The 401k funds, by default, were allotted to his spouse who elected to cash out rather than leave it in the market. My dad’s wife is completely financially illiterate and a very very heavy alcoholic who has not been processing his death well at all. This woman has never had to pay a bill, maintain any sort of steady employment, or hold any real responsibilities in the household. My father was never a wealthy man by any means, but was unfortunately stuck in a toxic, codependent relationship with her for 28 years.  

As it stands, my dad’s wife is sitting on this check with no idea what to do with it. She has been informed that if she were to deposit the full amount, she could be hit with a large tax penalty as a result of the income bracket it would force her into. I have tried many times to communicate with her, but she starts drinking from the moment she wakes up and is completely incoherent when she speaks. 

My sister and I are fearful that we may lose our employment, as so many have amidst this pandemic, and just want some way to facilitate getting the funds that our father left to us so we can put this into savings. This woman has said repeatedly that she wants to honor my dad by giving us what he allocated to us in the will, but we are getting nowhere because she is often too inebriated to go anywhere or speak with any financial professional. Is there anything that we could do- legally on our end or  just to better guide her? I am in unfamiliar territory here, and since my sister and I are in completely different states than this woman we are not able to do much of anything.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide. Please stay safe out there!",40,1585259747,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpkk9f/dad_left_my_sister_and_i_with_401k_money_after/,personalfinance,2

What habits/etc. can I start exploring to make me care about money?,"I come from a great deal of privilege, did well in college and grad school, escaped both without debt, and the jobs I've had before grad school and the one since have been extremely lucrative (100k+ a year, currently starting my next job after grad school at 130k+). I felt pressed for money right after college, but not really since then, and I'm just extremely laissez faire with my money, almost like it isn't real - I don't worry about going out to eat a lot or budget (although I live extremely frugally like I'm still in undergraduate, I have extremely cheap housing in a poor neighborhood, I drive a old used car, and when I don't eat out, I live off like rice, beans, and Huel, sometimes chicken).

I know what to do to be financially smart - my employer has a generous 401k matching plan I max out, I invest in the market a bit, I buy almost nothing and things that I can competently do myself like auto repairs I do, etc., but if it isn't a thing I can automate or something I can directly do to save money like car work, I just... don't care. For example, this last year, I didn't get around to actually calculating the utilities my roommates owed me for like 9 months because I just didn't care, money as a concept isn't important to me and I knew the utilities would be fine on autopay, and I assumed my roommates would pay me back because that's what I would do. One of them just moved out, and when I went and actually calculated it, it was like $1200 dollars per person, which was a bit shy of what I have from her in her security deposit. I don't really care about the $100 difference, but I'm realizing A. I should, I wouldn't just had someone $100, but that's effectively what I'm doing here, so why don't I care? b. that I've been very very very fortunate, and I can't count on that to always continue C. this kind of laissez-faire ""eh, it'll all balance out in the wash"" could be really stressful for my friends who don't make as much, and it would be more considerate if I was more conscientious.

fpkcp3,HalfManHalfBaked,Contribute to a traditional IRA to reduce my gross income below threshold to contribute to Roth?,"Sorry in advance for superfluous info. I tried to research this on my own, but couldn’t find the solution and TurboTax isn’t be helpful. 

I had one financial advisor that got me set up with a money market fund Roth IRA as a 26 year old right out of school. Once I realized how poorly aggressive that was, I stopped contributing. 

My second financial advisor wanted me to sign up for NY Life’s Whole Term life insurance investment vehicle. So I am leery and tired of not getting the right advice from people who know my whole situation.

Anyway, all I ever hear from my other mentors are Roth IRA. I’ve been contributing to a 401k thru my job and maxing the match. 

I wanted to contribute the max to a Roth IRA thru Vanguard for tax year 2019 and am already in the process of rolling over the money market fund from 2017-2018 to Vanguard. 

Turns out, I am about 4000 over the max gross income to contribute to a Roth. In a previous year, I was able to contribute to a traditional IRA to reduce my income enough to qualify for the student loan deduction. 

This year I’m taking the standard deduction, but thought I could contribute to a Trad to get below $137k to contribute to a Roth the remaining ~2k. 

Am I making this too complicated? I have a small traditional IRA thru USAA from that other prior tax situation. The second financial advisor told me this fund isn’t performing that well compared to some other funds. 

Should I just invest the 6k all into my USAA traditional for this year and call it done? And/or start a Vanguard traditional and roll over the USAA one? I can’t imagine my tax bracket would be higher in retirement. 

I also read that an HSA is important to invest in if possible.

fpk6nw,_MNor_,Pay medical provider directly or collection agency?,"I have collection agencies hitting my credit on behalf of medical providers.

If I understand correctly, this means that the overdue bill has been sold to the collection agency by the medical provider.

When I call the medical providers, however, they tell me that I can still pay my debt directly to them even though the debt is now also in the hands of a collection agency.

The amounts are also different. For example, I was told I could still pay my original bill of $100 to a medical provider. However, the debt collection agency is hitting my credit for $121 (presumably they've added some late fees of their own). 

I don't quite understand how this works...

If the medical provider has sold this debt to a collection agency, how can I still pay the medical provider directly? 

If I paid the medical provider directly $100, how would that wipe the collection agency's $121 from my credit report? 

If it is at all possible to avoid paying the collection agency and pay the medical provider directly instead, I would rather do that. The $121 bill is a small example, but some other bills they are charging me 3x as much as the original amount, while the hospital is still saying I can just pay the original amount to them directly.

After talking to customer service for airbnb I was assured that I would only be charged for the first month of staying there and possibly be fully refunded depending on how the coronavirus situation evolved. 

However, instead of just being charged for the first month that I had already paid prior, I was also charged an additional month. The customer service rep was just as confused as I was about it especially because my cancellation screen said I wouldn't be charged anything.

The customer service rep then went to their management and it was after that point I was stonewalled saying that it was policy and without a screenshot of the cancellation screen nothing could be done.

fpjz1l,KayleighAnn,"[MI] First time buying, fiance and I are looking for advice on securing a mortgage loan on a singlewide in our area.","With everything going on, I know this is a crazy time to be considering buying a house but this is just where we're at in our lives. I could use some advice on how to handle the whole process, from getting a loan to closing the deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

My fiance and I are in our late 20's, with a baby girl on the way. We are currently staying at my Grandparents place until they get back from Florida in June, and they're not charging us rent. Staying past June is not a good option for anyone though, the house is too small and I'm due in July. Otherwise, we'd stay and save more money to buy the trailer we're interested outright. We've saved enough so far to get an apartment if all else fails, but we're really looking at getting a trailer just so we know we can stay in one place for at least a few years and not have to move again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The loan we applied for is for 20K, with a 2K down payment. The next step is speaking with someone from the bank to discuss interest rates and the length of the loan, ect... What range should we be expecting as far as interest rates? 

&amp;#x200B;

If/when we agree on the loan rates and are pre-approved, is it worth getting a realtor? The two trailers we're interested in are listed at 15K and 17K, and newly renovated. With or without a realtor, we'll be having an inspection done of course if they accept our offer. How realistic would it be to get the price down, even if we don't anticipate finding anything substantial during the inspection?  One has been listed for months through the trailer park community office, the other is an individual owner listing and was listed last week. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, how long can we realistically expect this process to take? As I mentioned, we have the next two months to lock something down. Both homes are empty so at least we're not going to be stuck waiting on the family to move out if we finalize a purchase. With how things are right now, I can expect it to take longer than usual, but hopefully since it's a trailer the owners want to sell quickly and move on?

2. 1 conviction of driving with a suspended license, also a ticket for no insurance at this incident (Last October).

Obviously I'm a high-risk driver at this point. My current rate is \~$450/mo. Before these two incidents it was below $150/mo. As long as I stay current, how long before I can expect these rates to start reducing?

I have opened a SEP IRA with guidance from my accountant. I am a Real Estate Agent/Builder/Investor. 30 years old. I am struggling to figure out how much to put in the SEP IRA.

Here are my accounts:

Joint Brokerage Acct \~$30k Half IVV/ITOT Other half is MSFT

SEP IRA - \~$20k Split IVV/ITOT/QQQ

I have much of my net worth in a real estate project right now that is closing within a month. Probably around \~300k. Plan on putting some of this in the market. Would it be foolish to invest some of it in my brokerage account and not the SEP IRA so I can have access to it if I want/need it for the next real estate project? My max contribution to the SEP IRA is around $40k.

fpjrt2,hphills,I think my dad wrongfully claimed me on his taxes,"Hello, looking for some tax assistance and hope this is the right place. I am recently married and am trying to start my new life by moving to England to be with my husband (I'm American, he's British). I was married on 1/23/20, after the Dec. 31st cutoff for 2019 tax year. I am 23 years old. In 2019 I attended massage school, of which I was only a part-time student (no more than 2 or 3 classes per term). I lived with my dad for a 1/4 the year and my mom for 3/4. My dad drove me to school for that 1/4, but I paid my own phone bill, worked a full time job and bought most of my groceries except if we had a family meal. For the other 3/4 I paid for and rode public transit. The agreement was living there to save money for school and moving out. Here is the problem - my dad claimed me on his taxes this year and I don't think I qualify.

If he claims me my return is $164. If he doesn't my return is $2,015. I also don't qualify for the Covid-19 relief check of $1,200 if he claims me. He won't receive it as it caps off at $99,000 and he makes six figures/year. If I claim myself ASAP I will qualify for that plus the educational tax credit. I would be using the insurance credit, educational credit and exemption for claiming myself, plus money paid outside of fafsa deduction (books, etc).

I have worked full or part time and been in school since 16. I don't have a car, parents don't pay for any kind of insurance, ever given me an allowance or anything. They did not help out with my small wedding and are not extremely supportive of me moving to England (my dad doesn't want to see me grow up). On the flip side, my husband's parents have essentially adopted me and offered to match whatever money I come up with for visa and moving. So getting that $3,215 seems like a no brainer. My dad can afford to lose that.

FEDERAL Gross Income: $15,630.00 Adjusted Gross: $15,630.00 Total Deductions: $12,200.00 Total Taxable Income: $3,430.00 Total Tax: $0.00 Total Payments: $1,398.00 Refund Amount: $1,398.00 Amount You Owe: $0.00

STATE Gross Income: $15,630.00 Adjusted Gross: $15,630.00 Total Deductions: $2,270.00 Total Taxable Income: $9,886.00 Total Tax: $432.00 Total Payments: $1,049.00 Refund Amount: $617.00 Amount You Owe: $0.00

Please help - am I being selfish or is my dad? I don't want to seem like a spoilt child? Yet at the same time I could use that money. I am out of work because of Covid-19 until June 15th and my unemployment is only $200. Both my parents will be financially okay during this pandemic, my dad works from home as a pharmaceutical rep and trainer, and my mother is a surgical nurse. It only seems fair as a parent imo to want to let your kid get on their feet and start their adult life.

I have already asked my dad to amend his taxes and he said he won't. So I am thinking of mailing mine in and having the IRS investigate it. My mom even agreed with me that it was selfish of him and that he shouldn't be claiming me as an adult.",25,1585257102,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpjrt2/i_think_my_dad_wrongfully_claimed_me_on_his_taxes/,personalfinance,2

fpjnca,Seabee1893,"Refinancing my VA loan to cash out, bad timing?","About us: Both my wife and I have extremely stable incomes and I have over $1mil in guaranteed life insurance through several different companies. Either my wife and I can pay our mortgage and basic living expenses on one income. 

We're in a desirable area (MN) and have a fantastic neighborhood and great 4br 2ba house on a .25 acre lot. Home inventory has dropped significantly in the past month, no doubt because of COVID 19. 

Two weeks ago when interest rates were diving, I started the process of refinancing my home loan. We're 4 years into a 30 year and we've seen a nice uptick in our property value, but had some emergent expenses in the past year and a half that have me carrying a debt of about $17k on a 6% APR interest rate. 

Our cash-out will eliminate my personal debt and possibly eliminate my car payment too ($9.5k balance, 2.9%). 

We're in a 3.5% APR 30yr loan now, locked in to a 30yr 2.75% paying 1/4 point with the refi. The only significant setback will be the VA funding fee. I'm not registering for Disability until I retire from the military in less than 4 years. So I'm going to have to bite the bullet on the 3.6% funding fee.

I'm wondering if it might be a good idea to call off the refi.

Is it likely that I'm setting myself up for failure here? Our home value has been steadily climbing, but I'm worried that if/when the depression hits we might find ourselves upside down in our loan because of value. 

Though the refi-cash out option only let's us borrow up to 90%LTV, I'm still concerned that with dark times upon us, I could see a reduction in home value greater than 10% of our mandated remaining equity. 

All in all, I see clearing the debts as a great way to clear the books and start saving (beyond 401k) for rainy days. We could take the hundreds of dollars of payments and interest and sock it away in savings. With secure jobs and the ability to build a bigger savings account am I headed the wrong direction here?",4,1585256699,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpjnca/refinancing_my_va_loan_to_cash_out_bad_timing/,personalfinance,1

Consumers Credit Union Checking Account - Crazy high APY if you meet the requirements, but I'm not sure I will

fpjjwb,pornographic_pimple,How to take advantage of the current market with a 401K account?,"My spouse and I are looking to buy a house in a year (spring 2021) and have a lot of cash sitting in a high yield savings account right now. Outside of our 401K contributions (currently a roth 401K), all of our extra cash is going towards building up our savings for a down payment. That being said, we want to buy into the stock market now while it's low. I think it would make sense to ""borrow"" from our down payment savings the equivalent of our 401K contributions for the year and buy into the market now, then not contribute to the 401K for the rest of 2020 and instead divert that money to build back up our down payment savings.

For example, say we have $80K in savings right now and by the end of 2020 we would contribute an additional $30K to our 401K through regular payroll deductions. I propose to take $30K out of savings, put it towards our 401K now, then not contribute to our 401K for the rest of the year and instead pay back the $30K so that by the end of 2020 we're back to an $80K balance (ignoring any additional savings for simplicity sake).

The problem I run into is that my employer does not allow non-payroll contributions to our 401K accounts. Is there any way around this?

1.) Keep things as they as they are. Keep the VA Loan = 3.375% @ $998/mo. Owing 145k on the mortgage &amp; having roughly 350k on a future home purchase with the VA loan and still owing 30k on the HELOC.

fpij9r,xHOTPOTATO,"Got an insane hospital bill for a 30 minute visit, how do I negotiate this?","a month ago, our daughter had the flu. one thing led to another and she woke up screaming about her ears. We've been through ear infections before, really bad ones, and this was like someone was ripping off her limbs. Shes old enough to appropriately express what shes feeling and we believed her when she said it was the worst pain shes ever felt. an hour after some tylenol, she was still in significant pain. We feared shed ruptured an ear drum, so off to the ER we went.

&amp;#x200B;

It was 11pm and the only thing open was the emergency room at a very reputable childrens hospital \~30 minutes away. Mind you, we've visited this hospital before when she slipped and needed a sizeable gash glued on the backside of her head. That visit was at 8pm and cost \*\*\~$250\*\*. We show up, they triage her, have us wait on a bed in a hallway. Doc comes by, double ear infection, ear drums are intact, writes us an Rx for kids amoxicillin and sends us on our way.

&amp;#x200B;

In and out in just over 30 minutes. simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a month and we get the bill in the mail. its for \*\*$1830\*\*. That's AFTER the $207 insurance adjustment and our $150 co-pay for the ER.

&amp;#x200B;

We have the same insurance as when the last trip occurred. The bills read almost identical. same verbiage in the description. the CPT code is even the same between both visits. same adjustments. same copay.

I received a W2 form from my company, as well as a 1098T form from my school. I used TurboTax to see my return and I should be getting my full amount back. In order to process my 1098T form though I need to upgrade to TurboTax deluxe for$60. I am here to ask if it is worth it to do so. After doing some research it seems that after some people entered their 1098T form, their return turned into more taxes need to be paid. But it seemed it was because they had taxable grants &amp; scholarships, which I don't have. I also found something saying that if your tuition expenses are more than taxed owed, you will get more money back (up to $2500). This seems to be the case for me. Below is my information and please let me know if I would actually get more money back and if I should upgrade to process my 1098T form.

&amp;#x200B;

from W2:

\- Wages: about $10900

\- Tax withheld: about $1300

&amp;#x200B;

from 1098T:

\- Payments received for qualified tuition: about $12800

&amp;#x200B;

Below is some information about my current job situation and financials. My question really is with the below details about me, am I doing things right or am I missing something to help me get where I am set for retirement as early as I can?

Some level set information:

* 30M Currently employed at a tech firm living in Denver
   * Recently switched roles at the beginning of this year; the prior role didn't have a retirement plan
   * The current role I am not yet eligible for retirement plan (will be in about 1 month and plan to put about 20% in as i did at previous jobs that offered 401k)
      * There is no employer match, sadly...
      * There is a generous equity program, that being said we are not public 
   * Salary pretax is 105K

Financial information:

* Cash/savings
   * Checking= 13.5K
   * Savings= 15K (to note i am planning on shifting more money into the savings account, i recently moved some money around to put in the market with everything that is going onbut need to finish up)
* Debt/bills
   * Credit Card Debt= 4637 always paid off monthly (normally this is around 2K per month  but i am in the wedding party for 2 weddings and recently bought a ring myself, so have had an expensive start to 2020)
   * Mortgage= 197K
   * All bills including Mortgage= 1753 which I split about 60/40 with my fiance
* Retirement/Investments

I did some googling and it said that if a loan is in a parents name and they pass, you can provide proof and they will discharge the loan.

So I guess my question is: Is that true? Or will it pass onto his wife (married after we put the loan in his name)? Should I be trying to defer the loan until his time comes? This is the first major death that I'll be dealing with in my family and don't really know how any of this goes, and want to be prepared because I've heard how predatory these agencies can be.

I am completely new. New in this financial world, but also on Reddit. I was recommended this site, and trying to seek for some beginner advisement.

My friend told me about these so called ""ETF"", and I could really see the idea about them. I therefore bought some, but one of my questions is - can it pay off to invest in lots of these ETF, when they have a lower risk and therefore a lower ""return""?

Also, if you are new to this, would you recommended me to stay away from single stocks?

I have also read something about (DCA), however, I did not understand how they worked, how they was separated from ETF and stocks, or where to find them.

How would you guys invest as a newbie, and what are your advises, tips and tricks?

fphbnu,booninsoon,Should i be paying off debts completely? or just the minimums for now?,"Hello,

First i want to say i am very grateful and fortunate that during this crisis I still have a job and even some savings, there are lots of people that are in much worse off positions and this is a very scary time.

I normally do not have any debt besides student loans, but in December there was an emergency fix for my house and it blew thru my savings and so I had to take out a personal loan and credit card debt. 

I've already payed off half the personal loan and there is still $7k left on it, and about $12k between 2 credit cards.

I've been aggressively paying off the personal loan because it is a 20% interest rate.

The credit cards are at 16% and 14%. 

I have about $12k with me in my savings (just received my bonus and am getting my tax refund in).

My plan was to pay off the personal loan completely and then pay some of the credit card off, but I am wondering if right now I should hold onto the cash and just pay the minimums on the debt in case of something happening like getting layed-off (as far as i can tell there have been no signs indicating this but who knows).

My highest monthly expenses are:

-$2050 mortgage (was paying an extra $200 month on this, should i keep doing that?)

-$350 student loan (was paying an extra $100 month on this, all rates between 3.5%-6%) 

-$150 car insurance

-$200-300 month on food (i pay for parents and siblings as well)

Besides this the rest of my expenses are the minimums on the debt

-$150 on each card

-$415 on the personal loan

I make enough to pay the above but im just worried that if I pay some of the debts off and lose the cash on hand and there is layoffs that ill be f'ed.

The credit cards are accumulating about $60-70 a month of interest each and the personal loan about $150 a month

What do you guys think I should do?",5,1585248994,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fphbnu/should_i_be_paying_off_debts_completely_or_just/,personalfinance,1
fphblt,ohlawdanothertosser,Supposed to close first week of May. Will lose $10k in earnest money if we back out. Still considering backing out.,"This is a throwaway account, obviously. And this is more of a vent, then a look for predictions.   You can't really get too many good answers in r/RealEstate due to it having so many vested professionals.  I like the house, and the neighborhood, but there are other neighborhoods we *love* that, well, I'd ride out renting for a year if area prices dropped by 20% or more.  My job is based in tech, so no idea really one way or the other about security. Employer so far has been really good compared to others I see out there, but its a large corp that often lays folks off randomly in good times (""work force reductions"") while still paying out large bonuses. I could make it a year on no income if I'm laid off.

Money we have came from selling prior residence, so I won't actually 'feel' the loss of $10k, but boy if you took $10k out of my checking account, I would sure feel it.  And man, walking away from spending ten thousand dollars with nothing to show for it sure sounds incredibly irresponsible.  We're not rich. Plus, I did get a low interest rate, and who knows what happens there.

However, if the markets are going to crash (and how can they not?), perhaps losing $10k now  in order to get something ""even better"" (or even comparable to what I'm buying now, but say for $100k less) is just a price to pay? Our agent, of course, is convinced the market will only dip slightly and everything will be hunky dory.  But he even downplays the virus itself (sadly, so do a lot of folks in the area), so I can't totally trust him.  

Plus, the area I live in has a high percentage of VRBO type rentals, which surely will take a hit.  High tourist area. From a ""personal finance"" point of view, I would guess I would have to factor in the rent money per month for a year plus the $10k we lose if we back out?  That would add up to nearly $35k I guess that we'd have to 'make up?'  

Leads me back to going forward, but boy sure is scary.  And pretty sure I'll kick myself if I see incredibly low values a year from now.

My question is, is it an absolutely terrible, no-good, very bad idea to use the funds I've invested in my retirement account to contribute to the downpayment of a home? For some reason, I'm leaning towards it being a bad decision, but I figured I'd at least ask. I have enough saved (including to cover the tax penalty for early withdrawals) to easily put down 20% on a starter home that I would like and still have some leftover funds in the retirement account. 

Is this a really bad idea? I am saving for a home out of what's leftover from my paycheck, but this would get me to homeownership much faster. The two enormous downsides are the penalty for early withdrawals and the loss in interest I could earn from having more in the retirement account.

I presume he's talking about some sort of annuity, but I don't know a lot about the particulars or annuities in general.   I don't think there's any compounding interest with what he's describing but he doesn't know.  All he knows is I'm getting 7% and that's good.  I've tried to explain that if there were investments that guaranteed 7% with no risk/volatility, everyone would be in them (not that he believes me).  Over the past couple years, I have gotten them to move most of their retirement into a few Vanguard funds...mostly Target Retirement 2020.  It's hands off for me and them so it's perfect in general.

fpgyjr,DarkStar189,Carpet cleaner with a very specific tax write off question,"*This is not a normal question so maybe the answer is just no*

Hello everyone. I'll try to keep this as short as I can but also as descriptive as I can.  I'm self employed and own a carpet cleaning business (2 years now). 
I feel like knowing how this truck works is going to be important:

I use a truck powered carpet cleaning system called the Butler System.
https://www.butlersystem.com/
The machine is mounted inside the truck, and it connects to the engine with a drive shaft (called a power take off (PTO)) .  The truck engine powers a blower and water pump on the machine. The machine has a heat exchanger on it, it's connected to the radiator on the trucks engine. The super hot liquid from the radiator is brought back to the heat exchanger on the machine where the cleaning water goes through. The truck is heating the cleaning water and at the same time keeping the engine cool since the vehicle is just parked there. The engine is running around 1200rpm while cleaning.  

In the Butler manual, it states that for every hour the machine runs, it's equivalent to 33 miles of wear and tear on the vehicles engine. So you have to do more frequent oil changes/vehicle maintenance. 

At tax time, deducting mileage is a bigger write off for me but I'm still spending a lot on gas since the truck runs all day long, driving and while cleaning.
The pressing question in my head has been- can the machine hours count as vehicle mileage? I drove 12,882 miles in 2019.  My machine had 1,207 hours put on it, which by the manuals description means I put an extra 39,831 miles of wear/use on it (1207x33miles= 39,831).
I go to a tax guy to have my taxes done and he can't give me a clear yes or no. He's on the side that it does not seem like a big deal at all, and to go ahead and write off those hours as mileage, He said maybe just use the ""machine miles"" and not combine it with the 12k driven miles. The part that obviously concerns me is if anyone looks at driving records they will see that I didn't put 39k miles on the vehicle that year. Seems like that would raise a bunch of flags. The 39k miles make a huge difference on the tax return. Like getting a $6,000 refund vs a couple hundred.  Too big of a difference for me to risk having to pay it back later.  I'm not trying to do anything illegal. 
So I guess my ultimate question is where do i go for the right answer. Maybe the answer is just a strict NO since it wasn't a driven mile? There are not many professions in the work force with a vehicle like this so trying to find an answer is impossible.

fpgs5g,Willing-Childhood,Help! What are good financial steps to take right now?,"Hi everybody,

This is a throwaway account. I feel lost in this time and need some advice on what financial steps to take before the pandemic gets worse.

My situation is that I’m a filmmaker with a study permit in Canada. My spouse (also an international student) and I have invested most of our savings in the one bedroom apartment in which we live, and we have about 60k of savings, with a brand new 40k loan for a car (over 6 years.) I have a job until May but after that, I don’t expect to be able to find work anywhere, perhaps for a whole year (social distancing has effectively shut down the film industry until further notice.)

As a foreign resident, I’m taxed about 10k a year for owing property and I’m not eligible to any regional/national financial support. As a foreigner, I understand the priority for jobs should go to citizens and I respect that, though I’m also a full-time resident, and cannot afford to move away (the process of moving here has taken about five years.)

I know that I’m in a very privileged situation and I would like to use the money we have to maintain financial independence. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

fpgn0a,throwaway12039u12,Can I use a family members address to better my situation in these tax/employment scenarios?,"I relocated to PA a few years ago from MA. My family home is still in MA. I am on a lease at my apartment in PA, have updated my address with the IRS and paid PA taxes the last couple years, but I do still have an MA license for whatever that's worth. Recently, this has become relevant for 2 reasons:

1. MA requires employers to pay out unused PTO while PA does not. I'm considering changing jobs in the very near future. Would rather not burn roughly a full pay period of PTO on sitting around during coronavirus quarantine - the money would be far more useful. (I'm a remote employee, btw - company policy states they only pay out in states they are required to by law)
2. I just learned that PA is the \*only\* state that still takes state taxes from contributions to a traditional 401k (essentially forcing it to be structured like a Roth). This seems INSANE to me. Sure, as of right now they don't tax distributions, but what am I not supposed to move to any other state in the next 3-4 decades if I want to avoid being taxed on the same income twice?

So my question is whether I can change my address to that of my family home in order to improve my situation in these 2 cases. Is this legal? Does it come with risks? Is it as simple as changing my address with the IRS and my employer? I've never been one to try and game the system, but these legitimately feel unfair to me so I don't really have any moral issues with it so long as I'm not setting myself up for trouble with my employer or the taxman.",6,1585246781,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpgn0a/can_i_use_a_family_members_address_to_better_my/,personalfinance,0

My wife works 2 jobs (doesn’t need too but loathes idle time) and we have plenty of savings and the COVID economy is not affecting our short term finances nearly at all. So question:

with congress passing the bill that eliminates the 10% penalty on early withdrawals from a 401k and the fact that our joint income is significantly lower now than it has been, is pulling a modest amount out of my 401k to pay off credit card debt still a bad idea? I know conventional wisdom is to essentially ignore your 401k as a source of cash until retirement and I agree, but under the circumstances does it make sense? 

numbers: I haven’t contributed in months, 401k was \~35k during the bull and now \~26k with the bear, and I’m considering pulling out around 5k, meant exclusively for the CC debt ranging around the 15% APR area

fpgdlq,Xanthonious,Getting more involved with my investments/ portfolio," 

So I've recently been doing some of my own research and getting more involved with my investments. When I was younger I was set up by my dad but now that I'm a bit older I'd like to take responsibility over my investments. The investments I'm going to be talking about would be for long-term and retirement funds (I'm someone who's in their mid 20's).

So some questions I have are:

1. If I wanted to have a 90 stock/ 10 bond allocation would it be possible to do 90% VEQT and 10% VAB (based off the canadian couch potato portfolios)?
2. When my dad first set me up he had mutual funds in the account. Is it fine to have both mutual funds and ETFS or would that be redundant? I'm currently with RBC (and do not have any plans to change for the time being due to convenience) and the specific mutual funds I would be talking about are RBF556, RBF557, RBF559, and RBF700 (as far as I can see they are all indexes of some sort). And if it is fine would it still be possible to have a 90/10 allocation with those mutual funds with VEQT and VAB? I'm thinking I would not mind having a hybrid of allocations with maybe some dividends sprinkled in.
3. From what I've read it is impossible to time the market or is not recommended. So when would it be to take some of my investments out or sell? I imagine it involves some amount of ""if I need the cash now"" or ""am I comfortable with the gains so far""
4. Is it a good idea to sell bonds during a recession/ crash and reinvest back into my losing investments?
5. I've seen people say to make a plan and stick to it. So if I plan to do a dollar cost averaging type of investing, would it be ok to deviate from it a bit and invest more when I see a sale (e.g. during a recession/ corona virus?)

fpfxlq,Koshien83,How can I understand if my bank is intentionally humiliating me and why?,"I have this optional insurance that get charged on my bank account at the end of the month, usually on the same day my salary arrives. Since I make ends meet (no debts, no savings) with a permanent job contract, it can happens that they take this small amount from my bank account (less than the price of two books) a few hours before my salary arrive (at 1 PM) and the balance goes below 0 for about a couple of hours during the morning of the last day of the month.

Last year I was also comfortably paying for the gym in monthly instalments mid-way through the month, with no issue, and than this happened. A guy from the bank called me to say that they were doing the grand gesture of allowing me to go below and pay the insurance, and then asked me about my loan and when I figured out that he was talking about the gym he said ""oh, I'm sorry"" as if he was apologising but with a terribly ironical mellifluous voice. I totally refused his offer of buying a loan from the bank (I don't need any extra money on top on my salary and I have unsubscribed the insurance) and then at the end he asked me ""so you don't need any loan?"" with almost mockery in his voice.

Now this year in January they charged me -0,01 in passive interests for 2019, that's the grand total of what they charged: they had to chose this, I feel that they could have easily forfait it.

fpfvuc,FinancialCommittee,Too Much in Cash?,"I have been wondering this for awhile. I am fortunate enough to have a secure public sector job.  I have an FDIC-insured checking account that pays 4% APY on up to 50k (not open to new members).  For me, a 6 month emergency fund would be  around $13,000.

How do I decide how much to keep in cash at this risk-free rate, versus invest in the market, beyond an emergency fund?  Vanguard projections were that stocks were expected to only increase 4 to 6% over the next decade, but a taxable brokerage has better tax treatment as capital gains/qualified distributions (versus ordinary income for bank interest). 

Also, I would expect my 4% rate to decrease at some point. How do I decide how much to change cash on hand/investment in market if the rate goes down to 3.5% or 3%? Or do I just dollar cost average into the market over the next 6 months everything over my emergency fund amount?",7,1585244456,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpfvuc/too_much_in_cash/,personalfinance,0

fpfne9,BillyReddit12,Mid-20's; have a good foundation in place (I think) but don't know where to go from here,"Hi there! A little bit about me: I’m in my mid-20’s earning $62K/year and located in a US city with a relatively low cost of living. **I’m posting on here because after years of saving money I’m struggling with how to arrange my finances moving forward and need help**. Any advice you can offer is very much appreciated as I’ve been wanting to post on here for the last year but have been a bit nervous to do so out of fear of judgment. (This is a throwaway account as I'd rather not have anything financial tied to my main account.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Background Info**

For some context, it’s worth noting my family didn’t exactly have a lot of money growing up and going through that/always being aware of money has caused me to be really tight with my spending and stingy. I read through /r/personalfinance all the time and try to learn as much as I can, but I don’t really know of anyone personally that is particularly good with asset allocation/saving - that’s why I’m hoping to gain some insight from users on here. That being said, here is all the pertinent info.

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Income**

$3,760

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Expenses**

$879

* Rent: $400 (live in a duplex with a roommate)
* Food: $175
* Car payment: $199
* Car insurance: $45
* Gas: $40
* Gym: $20
* Phone: $0 (my work pays for it)
* Health Insurance: $0 (my work pays for it)

Notes: My main goal for the last 2-3 years has been to purchase a duplex and live in one unit while renting out the other (to cover a portion of my mortgage). Because of this, I made the decision to live at home with my parents and save as much money as I possibly could after maxing out my Roth IRA. My original plan was to live with my parents until I purchased a duplex, however, the local housing market has been booming the last couple of years (it’s the worst time to be buying a house in the last two decades), and any properties within my price range and within the neighborhood I’m focusing on have been gobbled up (my offers have been beat out multiple times). No longer wanting to be a burden of sorts on my parents, I decided a few months ago to modify my goal and move out. \**\*Please note that I am well aware of the fact that I should have moved out sooner - I’ve berated myself enough over this fact. I was just so focused on achieving my goal of buying a duplex that moving into an apartment with a roommate indicated to me that I failed, and it took me a while to accept that.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Finances**

* Savings: $54,000
* Roth IRA: $30,000 (I max this out every year; down \~ $7K since COVID-19)
* Roth 401K: $3,300 (My employer does not match its employees’ contributions so I haven’t put much into this)
* Stocks (ETFs, mutual funds, and individual): $28,000 (down \~$7K since COVID-19)
* Cryptocurrencies (BTC and ETH): $40,000

Notes: You’ll notice, what I acknowledge, is a poor allotment across the different areas. The high $ value in savings is partly due to my plan to have cash for a down payment on a duplex, and partly due to me being stingy with my money/afraid to spend money (due to how I grew up).

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly Investment Activity**

* Roth IRA: $500
* Roth 401K: $500
* Stocks: $1200
* Cryptocurrencies: $500

Notes: I used to save nearly all of my take-home pay, but over the last 12-18 months I’ve essentially stopped saving money to instead invest it into various vehicles. I figured that amount of money in my savings was already disproportionately high, so I should look to invest any and all “new” money.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Thoughts and My Asks**

I don’t know when I plan to buy a duplex at this point as I’m convinced, especially after having talked with some realtors, that we’re in a bit of a local bubble. My salary isn’t high enough to qualify for a pre-approval on duplexes in my preferred neighborhood, so I’ll either wait it out, expecting prices to come down (they very well may not come down), look at other areas, or search for a job that pays more. I really enjoy living with my roommate as we've been good friends since we were kids, so I'm in no hurry to leave.

**With all that in mind, what should I be doing with my money right now? Continue down the path I’m on? Re-allocate my monthly investments? Take out some of the money that’s in my savings account and invest it?**

Like I said above, any and all insights would be greatly appreciated. I think I have a good foundation in place - I just don’t know where to go from here. I'll be around here for a while to monitor this and answer any questions that may come up.

fpfm3a,mostly_poo,Home Warranty Company Closes Before End of Terms,"The home warranty on our newly purchased home was to extend through this June.

2 weeks ago, we started having problems with our kitchen sink, and my wife filed a claim and sent the $65 service fee (the payment went through). 

We heard nothing, and figured everything was at a slow-down due to COVID-19. About a week later, we sent an email, following up. Still nothing. This morning, I went to their website, looking for answers, and the front page was  the following message: 

“It is with the heaviest of hearts that Freedom Home Warranty has been forced to cease business. This Corona Virus has absolutely crippled our ability to do business. 

We are so sorry for the inconvenience and the devastating news of us closing our doors.  We made every effort possible to salvage the unsalvageable with no success. 

Please take care of your families and pray this global crisis ends soon”

I feel for the Home Warranty Company is going out of business, we’re being hit by this too, everyone is - it sucks. But at the end of the day, we spent $565 on a service for a year and have received zero service.

I was reviewing a few high interest savings accounts such as a TD Beyond savings account. It looks like they would pay out 0.005% monthly so I would make like $100 monthly from the interest. they are also doing a promo where I get $500 for opening the account with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any experience with this type of savings account? What do you recommend for earning the best interest in a low risk account? Thanks

fpeur2,TheGoatFarmer,Refinancing — should I take some cash out given the current economic situation?,"Currently in a 30 year, 4.0% mortgage with ~$204K loan amount remaining. Originated in 2017, and paying PMI, though a reappraisal would get rid of that. Rate locked a 30 year, 3.0% refinance two weeks ago with $3300 in closing costs (rolled into loan). The closing costs seems high compared to others in this thread, but they're actually the most competitive I've found from local lenders -- I believe it is state specific requirements. 

The refinance is a no-brainer -- I'll reduce my payment by ~$150/month, save $20K in interest over the term of the loan and closing costs will be paid back in about 20 months. We'll be in this house for at least five years.

The curveball here is we need a new roof, to the tune of about $20k. We've saved this amount up and were ready to sign a contract, but given the current economic situation (wife's job is stable, mine is less certain), have paused. We have a 9 month emergency fund on top of the money set aside for the roof without cutting any current discretionary spending. 

Our appraisal came in very high, and we have plenty of equity in the house. Confirmed with the lender that a cash out refi as high as $50K is doable and will not affect the interest rate. 

I'm thinking of taking some cash out to to fund the roofing project (between $10-20K), and have some peace of mind should our job situation changes due to Corona that we have a long-term emergency fund. Below is a table of the various proposals, including monthly payments, total loan costs and total interest:

https://i.imgur.com/gqhoi0V.jpg

The way I look at it is -- worst case, I lose my job, but we can still put the new roof on and have a healthy emergency fund, while still reducing our monthly payment from what it is now (and with a lower total loan cost up to the $10K cash out option). Best case, both of our jobs are stable, we don't need to tap into the emergency fund, and I dump whatever sum of cash out I took right back into the mortgage once things settle down, putting me at the same trajectory should I have not taken the cash out (with a slightly higher monthly payment). Currently leaning towards the $10K cash out option, and funding the rest of the project from savings. 

Am I missing anything here? Thanks all for your time.",7,1585241234,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpeur2/refinancing_should_i_take_some_cash_out_given_the/,personalfinance,2
fpeul5,IRAconfused44,New IRA from parents - questionable investments?,"Hey everyone! 

My parents had set up a Roth IRA for minors in my name, and they just rolled it over to me. I'm super grateful for this, and I've been spending a lot of time reading about investing for retirement (e.g. *Bogleheads'*, r/personalfinance wiki, etc.). 

From what I've gathered, as someone in his late 20's, my best bet is investing in funds of funds (e.g. Vanguard Targets) or a diversified portfolio of mostly mutual funds of stocks. 

Unfortunately, there are only 2 securities in the account right now, and they don't seem to be ideal. The first is a corporate bond that's set to mature this summer. The second is ""TGMNX TCW TOTAL RETURN BOND N"", which appears to be an ""Intermediate Core-Plus Bond"". I'm not entirely sure what to make of this investment (no maturity date?). 

I have a few questions:

1) I'd like to change my entire portfolio to a Vanguard Target Fund. Is this a reasonable strategy?

2) If so, how do I go about getting rid of the current investments? Should I wait until the corporate bond has matured and then sell it? What do I do with ""TGMNX"", which doesn't have a maturity date?

3) The cash purchasing power of my portfolio is a fraction of the total worth. I'm guessing I buy Vanguard Target Funds with cash purchasing power and that I'll have more cash purchasing power once I sell the bonds? Or can I simply trade the bonds for the Target Funds?

4) Are there any special considerations I should be aware of for buying/selling securities during the current pandemic? (and its effects on the economy?)

fpeqjl,Paroxysm111,Is now a good time to buy a car?,"Before this epidemic happened, I was planning on buying a used car around June, when my savings would reach my goal for my car budget. (Around $6000 cad) 

I've been watching what's for sale in the mean time so I can get an idea of what good market value is for the car I'm looking for.

Recently the prices seem to be dropping, and I found a listing for a great car that's a good 2000 dollars cheaper than I was planning to spend. I have about half the cost of the car available in my savings and could dip into my emergency fund to supply the rest. I'll still have at least 2 months expenses if I dip into my emergency fund. I should be able to bring my emergency fund back to the full amount within 2 months if I don't suffer any major financial crisis. Right now I consider my job to be very stable, as we're still working during the quarantine, my team is understaffed and my company has offered paid time off to anyone who needs to quarantine due to exposure to the virus.

I read that the prices are supposed to go back up by the end of April. Is it worth it to buy a little sooner for the big discount at the cost of reducing my emergency fund?",1,1585240862,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpeqjl/is_now_a_good_time_to_buy_a_car/,personalfinance,1

I was thinking of investing in ETFs since many months and now as I have some free time (called homeoffice :D) I set up an account to trade with ETFs.   
I want to do a 'standard' strategy with 70% MSCI World and 30% Emerging Markets. The investment will be 250€ each month. I checked a website to compare ETFs and decided to go for these two:

 Xtrackers MSCI World Index Swap UCITS ETF 1C (ISIN: LU0274208692)  
 Xtrackers MSCI Emerging Markets UCITS ETF 1C (ISIN: IE00BTJRMP35)

What do you think, is that fine? I took the best 'performing' fonds from the comparison which is why I chose the 'Swap'-version of the MSCI World. My broker only supports Xtrackers and Amuni ETFs.

I'd be going into Biology thinking about PA route or medical research, so I suppose in-demand fields. However also I kind of dream about having a small landscaping company :/ 

I'm incredibly conflicted about taking out a student loan when all i'm reading about is how much the economy is going to or already has tanked. I have a year experience in a trade hat I would fall back on and pursue, but thats only last resort as i've really worked hard to get to where I am academically. I've already taken the last year off to work/travel, so this pandemic just leaves me very conflicted.

I reached out to the landlord requesting a reduced rent or to be allowed to break my contract. They responded that I should look into a small business loan.

fpdijp,amark96,Student Loan Repayment Strategy with 0% Interest,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 23-year-old young professional who graduated college last year and is looking to pay off student loans as quickly as possible. Currently my balance is $95,000 for private loans at 4.47% interest and $27,000 federal loans ranging from 3.51% to 4.80%. I pay $1100 per month on the private loans and $288 for the federal loans putting me on track to be paid off in less than 10 years.

Some other stats: I have a $56,000 salary (working from home each day, job seems pretty stable), solid emergency fund (~$18,000), 8% contribution to 401k with 5% match, and pay roughly $1050 per month for all other expenses (utilities, food, internet, gas).

While things are up in the air, the stimulus package could suspend federal loans for 6 months at 0% interest. If that goes through, which option would be more beneficial to me in the short term and long term?

1. Nothing changes - pay the same amount each month toward the private and federal loans, knowing the latter is all principal

2. Suspending the federal loans and allocating the $288 toward the private loans.

Would appreciate any input. Thanks!",13,1585236791,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpdijp/student_loan_repayment_strategy_with_0_interest/,personalfinance,1

fpddok,enlguy,American in Europe wants to invest in U.S. markets (no U.S. bank),"I have been searching around, but hope to find someone here who knows what's up, because I haven't found much help at all.  

I'm a U.S. citizen, but have been living abroad for years.  My US. bank closed my accounts for inactivity well over a year ago at this point.  I have an account in the EU (Poland).  I have seen other threads recommending just investing in EU indexes, like through Dutch Vanguard, but that stuff is shit compared to U.S. indexes (Euro STOXX 50 has lost points over the last 5 years, Vanguard Growth ETF had doubled, and even recently is way up from 5 years ago).  I  have a Stockpile account I now cannot do anything with, and support told me, well, they were incredibly unhelpful and uncaring, but I can't even touch my own money there anymore.  I cannot withdraw to a non-U.S. account, so I've literally lost what I put in there.

I am looking for something similar to Stockpile (I do not have a ton of money to put in to investments right now, and want to build over time)  that would let me do it from Europe.    
I guess what I'm looking for:

\- Either a U.S. bank account I can open from Europe (most bank sites stop you once you see you're not in the U.S., citizen or not) that will work with investment sites, or

\- Some sort of app/site similar to Stockpile that doesn't require you to be in the US. to use, or have a U.S. account.  

Any thoughts?

This is the first time ever really where I was making a bit of money each week, and having a steady job. I am a dishwasher making $12.75 an hour. I typically work 20 hours a week. My club of employment is currently closed until April 17th due to the virus. The company paid us two weeks in addition the last week we worked before we closed. I feel really lucky to work at a place that looks out for us. So my problem is my parents have been taking advantage of me. I would never leave them helpless or anything. I have a lot of resentment towards them. Every time I get a large some of money they always ask to get some. My sister and I work at the same place. Mom was livid we got more even though we busted our butts off. She works full time and is able to pay her bills. Her biggest problem is not having a decent savings account. She also has a hard time managing her credit card account. Every christmas she goes super overboard. All four of my siblings and I said numerous times we dont want to see her paying off her credit card because she bought us gifts. We just want her to enjoy the holidays. We are all adults now and christmas isnt about getting gifts anyway. She has skimmed down on that but still struggles with overspending. My dad had 10,000 in the bank from inheritance. He was always buying stuff online, he had car repairs as well as I. I paid him back. He says hes now broke and we just found out his job is asking for time off. So we found out the government is sending out checks. My dad then proceeds to tell me any checks I get they expect me to pitch in. Hold up. Im unpemployed already paying $100 in rent. $45.00 for my phone. I'm doing what I can but when I see packages being delivered to the house I get so mad. I expressed my concerns about helping my parents. They literally told me ""you have 2 K in your savings whats the worst that can happen if its at zero""? I said excuse me but did you bust your butt off to have that much? No you expect me to pick up the pieces because of your selfish spending habbits."" They didnt like that answer and told me I'm selfish. So now I'm here stuck with them in this lockdown. I plan on moving out this summer. I have over $2600 in my savings. I am working on bulding my credit so i can get my own place. My goal is to have $6,000.00 in savings on top of a 4 month emergency fund.

fpd3e3,leopor,Index Funds: Vanguard vs Fidelity - big difference or am I overthinking this?,"Currently have all of my funds with Fidelity (about 500k) and I am happy with them. Planning on investing in a 4 fund portfolio for growth. From my research everyone recommends the Vanguard funds first, specifically:

* VTSAX (65%) - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares
* VTIAX (15%)- Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares
* VBTLX (10%)- Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Admiral Shares
* Either:
   * VGSLX (10%)- Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund Admiral Shares
   * VTABX (10%)- Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Admiral Shares

I believe Fidelity has funds that mirror these. From my research it looks like I should be looking specifically for ""Spartan"" funds but I did not have much luck with that. I am assuming they rolled some of these funds together for simplicity, but if my choices below are incorrect or there are better options, please let me know.

The Fidelity funds also seem to have less expense ratios when compared to Vanguard, but it seems like Vanguard has a patent until 2023 to reduce capital gains taxes making their funds more tax friendly. I am definitely not against doing a little work to transfer my funds over to Vanguard if in the long run (20-30 years) it's going to net me a significant difference, but I am not sure if I am overthinking it and the difference is extremely negligible, and could favor one or the other over the long run. 

Specifically, these are the funds I am looking at:

* FSKAX (65%) - Fidelity® Total Market Index Fund
* FTIHX (15%) - Fidelity® Total International Index Fund
* FXNAX (10%) - Fidelity® U.S. Bond Index Fund
* Either:
   * FSRNX (10%) - Fidelity® Real Estate Index Fund
   * FBIIX (10%) - Fidelity® International Bond Index Fund

There's also the option to go with ETF's, but from my understanding these aren't as easy to setup monthly recurring transactions into, and some money might be left on the table since you can't buy partial shares. My picks there were:

* VTI (65%) - VANGUARD TOTAL STOCK MARKET ETF
* VXUS (15%) - VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK
* BND (10%) - VANGUARD TOTAL BOND MARKET
* Either:
   * USRT (10%) - ISHARES CORE US REIT ETF
   * BNDX (10%) - VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL BOND

&amp;#x200B;

From a backtest portfolio test of VTSAX vs FSKAX vs VTI, vtsax wins. I guess my question is, will it always because of the way they have it setup to mitigate capital gains taxes, or could it go either way and I'm overthinking it? I'm not opposed to using either company and don't mind doing extra work if it pays off in the long run.

I think he opened an account with my information several years ago.,"I recently opened an Experian account.  Let’s pretend my name is John Smith, and my brother’s name is Sam.  Looking over my Experian report, in the personal information section, it says “Name: John Smith, also known as: Sam Smith”.   

Seeing this reminded me of a time several years ago when I applied for a Macy’s card.  I entered my SSN on the keypad, and the cashier said “Sam Smith?”   I was surprised and said “No, that’s my brother.”  At the time, my brother was horribly addicted to heroin and made a habit of finding creative ways to steal money from everyone in the family.  I am fairly certain he at least attempted to open an account at Macy’s or somewhere else using my SSN.  I was about 19 at the time and had never opened a credit account before.  

I have good credit, and I don’t think this is a huge issue anymore.  However, I would like to get to the bottom of how his name got attached to my credit information and remove it from the record.  I tried disputing it on Experian’s website, but the Dispute Center insists that all name disputes be resolved over the phone.  The automated phone line has no option for this and immediately hangs up on me when I ask to speak to a human.  Ultimately, I know it is not Experian’s responsibility to resolve this, and I am not sure where to go next.

I got it last year when rates were at their peak.  I've been thinking about refinancing since rates were lowered, but now there's a lot of uncertainty about my job situation, so I'm looking to trim that fat wherever I can.  Could I realistically get a lower rate, my score is ~780? If so how would I go about doing it, can I just look up the websites for lenders or do I need to call them? Do I need to do all the inquiries on one day so I only get one hard pull? Is it even worth it?

fpcsdw,Djg35,Is it wise to stop loss my holdings?,"TL;DR:  


I have an account outside retirement (robinhood) and obviously I've taken a beating.  No biggie, I'm not worried. 

 One of my holdings (MGK) is now positive today, I'm wondering, is it wise for me to stop loss at my average basis so that if it drops, my cash is safe and if it continues to drop I can always buy in at a lower price. 

 If it goes up, at least I protect my basis so other than a bit of time I've lost no money.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, given volatility, if a stock (or ETF) I own goes to flatline I'm tempted to stop loss since I won't be surprised if we see another sharp decline.

Here's my situation- I am a US citizen married to a resident alien and filed my 2018 taxes Married Filing Jointly. My husband was in the process of applying for his residency when we filed, so we applied for an ITIN for him at a IRS Taxpayer Center. The ITIN application was subsequently rejected. I contacted IRS and they said they thought the reason for rejection was because no W2s for my husband were enclosed. I explained he didn't have any income and they said all I needed to do was write a letter certifying that I was the sole earner for 2018. I did as they instructed and a few months later got a notice saying I owed $500. Initially, our return showed we were to be refunded $1,400. I called the IRS and they said my filing status had been changed since my husband didn't have an ITIN. I explained his residency was in process and he would soon have a SS#. They put my account on hold for 16 weeks and said to file an amended return once he received his SS#. I sent off the amended return in January and filed my 2019 taxes earlier this month. The $500 they said I owed from 2018 has now been deducted from my 2019 return amount deposited in my account. The automated line says my amended return is still in process (it has been 9 weeks). Once the amended return is processed, will the IRS automatically adjust the refunds I am owed ($1400 refund+$500 automatically deducted) or do I need to manually request this?

I was in need of a new vehicle, and C1 was my only financially feasible option. My rate is very high, but I could afford the payments (and still can). I do not NEED a new vehicle, my car is in great condition with low mileage. 

Also, to add,  I work in a very secure and essential sector with a good salary and job security. My credit cards should be close to or completely paid off by the summer.

For the last nine months I have gotten pre-approved car loan offers, which I ignore, directly from the manufacturers, although they won't disclose interest rates unless I come in and submit a credit check.

But now I am thinking that with my improved (but not great) score I should perhaps take advantage of new low rates to refinance, but don't want to hit my credit unless I have excellent chances of getting a better rate, or upgrading my vehicle and lowering payments at the same time.

Is it worth me exploring seriously? I would most likely buy a used certified vehicle, not brand new, if I went that route.

fpbu8r,shunestar,"Please don’t ask your bank for relief, if you don’t need it.","I’ve seen a lot of discussion around people inquiring about getting 90/180 day special pricing or deferment terms form their bank due to COVID-19 shutdowns. If you’re still employed, open for business, or otherwise able to make your loan payments, please don’t ask your bank for relief.

If you don’t *need* these special terms, by asking for them, you’re causing economic harm. Here’s how:

Banks are collecting data on all of this activity. They will formalize policies and procedures for future circumstances like the COVID-19 shutdowns. Bank’s formalized policies can be quite rigid, as I am sure some of you understand. When the data shows how much relief was granted, and under what terms etc, it’s very likely the banks start to move *against* providing relief in the manner or capacity they are now. When executives have their annual Vegas/Hawaii retreats next year, you can bet that this topic will be on the agenda. You may need financial help in the future, don’t be the borrower crying wolf now. 

Your banker is busy attempting to provide relief to those who need it, while also trying to grow new loans to keep the economy churning as much as possible. When you call in to modify your loan, you’re taking their time away from places/people that actually *need* the attention. 

You are most likely costing yourself money by modifying your loan agreement. Interest only means you’re simply paying the bank money for that much longer, without improving your equity position. Deferment changes your payoff/pay down schedule, and could come with fees. It may come with new covenants and terms as well. 

Ultimately, if you are out of work or are trying to assist your employees, ask for the help you need. Hopefully your banking partner is there to support you. If you are asking for 90 day deferment to simply hold onto your cash, or to try and take advantage of this devastating circumstance, you’re an asshole.

fpbo6m,chefddog3,Former employer is still paying me and unemployment,"On Dec 30th I applied for unemployment (temporarily layoff  from Company A due to construction and place was closed for a few months), which was approved and I continued to collect for 4 weeks.  On Feb 5 I started a new job (Company B).  I just stopped filing for weekly benefits. After 6 weeks I decided I didn't really like that job and went back to Company A which was about to reopen and after negotiating a better package.

Last day of Company B was March 13th.  First day of Company A was March 14th.   Due to gov't shut down of non-essential businesses I was again laid off on March 20.  Great timing right?

I was able to re-file for unemployment and had to answer a bunch of questions on why I hadn't file for weekly benefits since early Feb.  No big deal.  I received the money today.  I only worked 2 days last week, so the amount was prorated.  Totally expected. 

Well today I get an alert that Company B paid me for last week??????????  I didn't work there last week. I reached out to my former manager, but she hasn't gotten back to me. (she is a little flaky and wasn't paying us correctly anyway. i.e we were hourly with a time clock, but all of our checks were a flat 40 hours, even if we worked a little more than that).      

 I know I have to pay back the money.  I'm not spending the money and will return it however we decide.   I'm hoping they can just reverse the tax paid portion. If not, we can work out a payment plan as being unemployed I really don't want to pay out the cash right now for a mistake I didn't make. 

My question is how will this impact my unemployment?  Are they going to see I was paid for last week and will have to pay back the money? Even though I really didn't work and it was just a mistake? What steps should I take to protect myself in case they do come back in the future?",1,1585230060,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpbo6m/former_employer_is_still_paying_me_and/,personalfinance,1
fpbny8,hethuisje,Mortgage refinance with change from 30 to 20 years - sanity check?,"I have a 30-year mortgage from 2017 at 4.125% with a balance of $289k. My lender is offering a 20-year fixed rate at 3.375%. This shaves 7 years off (which I want, since I'm already in my 40s, I did not want to restart the clock on 30 years) while raising the payment about $200/month. I think I can afford the higher payment as I have gotten several raises since I bought the house... it takes PITI from 16.6% of my monthly gross to 18%. I am a risk-averse single person you wouldn't think I'd want a higher monthly payment but $19xx vs. $21xx doesn't seem like a big deal. I think it saves me \~$75k in the long run.

It includes $2400 in points (well, less than 1 point really) and $3700 in closing costs, but rolls that into the loan so nothing is due at signing. Ordinarily I wouldn't like that but I have cash saved for some needed improvements, and this doesn't seem like a good time to give that up.

The closing costs seem high, but this is my current lender and I really like them. I can probably haggle on the fees a little. The closing costs were slightly more when I first bought, which I think is typical in this area.

Sanity check--this seems good, right? I think I could do better on the fees/points but I don't really have time to shop around and I trust this lender. Since I'm single and in a different financial position than most of my family, I don't really have anyone to run this by.

fpb0kj,JoeAlien,Mortgage Relief Programs,"Seeing a lot of posts here regarding how to handle job loss and file for unemployment, so figured additional information regarding Mortgage Relief Programs would be relevant. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Conventional Loans) as well as HUD (FHA) have all announced there will be some sort of mortgage relief program due to the current circumstances. 

**How to start?** Begin by calling your mortgage servicer (who you make your monthly payments to). Be prepared for long hold times, but make sure you speak with someone who can give you clear answers. Each servicer will have a slightly different process of what documentation you need to provide and what steps you need to take in order to be eligible. 

**What questions to ask your servicer?** What is the criteria of getting approved for this? What documentation do I need to provide and when is that due by? When will this take in to effect? Will this be added to the end of my loan term or do I have to make it up in additional payments when I am back to work? How long am I able to defer these payments? **Note - All of these answers will vary by loan type and your specific servicer.** 

**Important Info:** 

\- **Documentation -** I really can't stress this enough. KEEP ALL OF YOUR INFO DOCUMENTED. Mortgage servicers and credit bureaus are being overwhelmed with activity and changes. Circumstances have changed so quickly and it is taking them time to adapt. Some of your late payments may be incorrectly reported to the credit bureaus. It is important to document that you have been granted mortgage relief. While it may have a negative impact on your score initially, don't panic, the documentation will save you by getting it removed from your report and help you purchase another home in the future.

**- If you are able to make your mortgage payment, DO IT -** Channel your inner Shia LeBeouf. Knowing the mortgage and credit bureau industry, this process will be clunky from start to finish. You may have to make some sacrifices, but it will be worth it. Also, it will allow the people that are desperate to get assistance more quickly and easily.  

\- **Renters -** There can be relief for you as well. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also released that they are doing forgiveness on multi-family properties for 90 days. This means if you leave in a multi-family rental unit, your landlord may be eligible to miss 3 months worth of payments with no penalties. If you are struggling to pay rent and worried about eviction, call your landlord and provide them with this info. 

**Stay Informed:** 

   [https://www.fanniemae.com/portal/media/corporate-news/2020/renters-covid-19-multifamily-7002.html](https://www.fanniemae.com/portal/media/corporate-news/2020/renters-covid-19-multifamily-7002.html) \-

TLDR; Call your mortgage servicer and get info on their mortgage relief program. Keep all of your documentation surrounding this program and your financial situation. Pay if you can.

fpat7u,EGL_or_EDC,Will a credit to an incorrect card number expire?,"A few weeks ago there was some suspected fraud on my Chase credit card so the number was changed and I was issued a new card.

Last week I had to cancel a reservation I had made, and was issued a credit to the old card number. I was told by the hotel several times that this should just ""go through"" but after more than a week and not seeing it on my statement I don't think that's true. I was able to get through to someone at the main Chase support line who was able to find the credit, but they needed a ""specialized team"" to transfer it. After waiting on hold for over 3 hours yesterday I do not think I'm going to get through to anyone while COVID-19 is at its peak sending people home. I also sent a few messages through the Chase mobile app and through Twitter and it's been 4 days without a response.

My question, will this credit expire at some point? Will I be out that money if I can't get through to someone in a few weeks? I'm ok waiting but I'm extremely anxious about never getting my credit back if it's been too long.",2,1585226389,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fpat7u/will_a_credit_to_an_incorrect_card_number_expire/,personalfinance,1

fpaib4,botanicalbae,Not sure how to go about unemployment in IL,"Hi everyone, I just need some general advice because I truly have no idea how this works.  I am 25 and working two part time jobs in IL. I work 20-25 at an office and 10-15 at a home improvement store. The office has cut my hours to about 10 a week and i’m still getting about 15 at the store.  I was told by my office manager that it I wanted to be laid off and file for unemployment (due to covid) I could do that so I could earn more than I’m making now. 

1. is there anything wrong with asking to be laid off in order to make my average amount of money? 10 hours a week isn’t cutting it. 
2. would I even qualify for unemployment since I do have another part time job?

I work in elective healthcare so obviously we have been shut down since COVID. Due to this, my entire company (other than high level and c-level employees) were temporarily laid off “so we could apply for unemployment benefits.” My second to last check (we worked one Monday of the new pay period) is coming in tomorrow and it should be closer to $985-$1,000 but it’s $548. Literally half of what it should be. 
The only thing I can think is that I used “un-accrued PTO” for a vacation in the beginning of the year. Are they able to “charge” me for using my approved PTO then being laid off under no fault of my own? Especially since it is supposed to be considered a temporary layoff?

fp9qcx,Cinnamonstik,Dream of owning a home within a year,"I’m seeking advice on a debt repayment strategy. 
I am a single with no kids or pets. My income is $7,500/month after taxes. Stable job in healthcare. I have no savings at all. My apartment lease is up at the end of May. I am contemplating restructuring my debts to qualify for a home loan as a first time home buyer in an economic opportunity zone where my down payment of 3.5% will be made for me as a grant. I am open to alternative options on financing as well as renting cheaply or living out of a car or staying with a family member for upto two months after my lease is up (so until end of July) to come up with the 20% needed for a conventional to avoid PMI. My main worry is being denied for a home loan because I had a business I’ve closed two years ago that I am still paying debt on. The business is closed so not generating any money at all only expense of debt. Also the payment is imho kinda high so it would make me qualify for a lot less house even though it’s only like a year I have left to pay on it. 

I have $8,000 of debt remaining on an lease from an old business that failed. Payment with equipment insurance is $600 a month with about 13 months remaining. It costs me $144/year to keep a business checking account. It costs $480 a year in insurance on that lease for the equipment. I have sold the equipment but still have to maintain the insurance because I wasn’t supposed to sell it until it was paid off. 

In addition to that; I HAD $5,409 in credit card debt. $3900 of that balance at 0% until June. On that same credit card I just got $5,000 deposited in my checking today for an upfront 4% $200 fee with 0% for 12 months. My balance is now $10,409.00 of which $5,000 is zero percent for a year and 3,900 is zero percent for another three months. 

I also have $3600 remaining on an auto loan at 5% interest. $245 monthly payment, I believe 16 payments remaining. 

In summary;
DEBTS;
$242/month car payment, balance of $3,745
$200 credit card payment, balance of $10,400
$600  machine payment, balance of $8,000
Total of;
$1,042 month debt payments, balance of ~$22,500

Bills/expenses;
$40 Cell 
$115 cable:internet(will cancel in May) 
$75 electric 
$1200 rent (lease ends at the end of May) 
$500 food(I know it’s high, I’m overweight/like to eat) 
$170 gas, auto maintenances, insurance 

Cash on hand $5,072(includes the $5,000 I just got from credit card) 
Paid tonight midnight $3500 not yet cleared.

- M1 Finance investing // 15%

fp95vh,RandomQuestion75321,How can someone forfeit a job offer when unemployment is more than they ever earned?,"Context: All her life my girlfriend has worked basic restaurant jobs, cashier, dishwasher, etc. Usually 30 to 40 hours per week earning 8 to 10 dollars per hour. It sucks but she works hard and makes the best of it.

Recently she was laid off as all restaurants were ordered to close. It hurt her motivation but I pressed on her to look for temporary work as fast as possible. I told her she could do a service to both herself and the nation if she could find work resupplying people with essentials.

Well she did — she got a temporary job at a warehouse making $17 per hour, 24 hours per week, supplying people with essentials like toilet paper and medicine. She’s scheduled to start on April 4th.

Now the government is talking about hiking unemployment benefits by $600 per week. I’m shocked and totally confounded. Based on her recent income we think her unemployment benefit under old law would have been about $90 per week. Now it would be about $690 per week.

I can’t pretend to mask my political opinion of this. I understand the money is GREAT for people who need it. But it’s more money than she’s ever made at any job her whole life, and because the new job is only 24 hours per week, it’s also more money than she’d make at the new job, too. Not to mention the new job hasn’t started yet, while she’s unemployed NOW.

She doesn’t qualify for stimulus money because she was a student last year. If she takes this new job she’s looking at getting zero benefits from the legislation. Whereas if she’s unemployed she can make more money by doing nothing than she’s ever made her whole life.

How can we strategically abandon a job and claim unemployment when the government has made that the best available option?",1,1585218092,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp95vh/how_can_someone_forfeit_a_job_offer_when/,personalfinance,1

fp8d5l,deanstreat,"28 Year old human, could use some advice right now.","**Context:** I'm a 28 year old guy, trying to figure out my way through life and could use some input on my next step/s in life.

**Background:** I have 11+ years experience working in hospitality and restaurants/bars. 10 of those years managing and running restaurants.

I have seen myself as owning and operating my own bar as my ""retirement"" plan for the past 7 or 8 years (as in, come into my place 6 to 7 days a week with zero fucks, just so long as I can pay the bills, order and payroll, and successfully staff like 3 - 5 people; this is of course after the first 3 to 5[ish] years of getting the place running and profitable, with a fantastic GM who can operate without me).

I'm not looking to get rich with a bar, but rather eventually get to the spot where I can own a place that I feel comfortable leaving for 8hrs to 1 week and know that it'll at least bring in some profit, and provide a job to a handful of amazing people down the line.

I recently, within the past 12 months, have left a management position I hated to pursue a bartending job with the best bar program in my city to learn as much as I can.

I want to figure out how to make this a reality.

**Further &amp; Financial Background:** $10K in student debt (on time) for a degree in Fine Arts (photography and visual media), and $1.9k medical debt (in collection, 5.5yrs). 622 Trans and 641 Equifax. 2k in emergency fund. Zero in savings beyond that, &amp; I have taken a massive hit with COVID right now.

**Goals:**

Short Term - Get outta debt. Don't know if I should pay off old debt and be clean or wait it out 1.5 years to fall off.

Short Term - Propose and get married to 4.5year partner. Family (mostly hers) is stupefied that I haven't proposed yet, but I don't feel comfortable with my debt + marriage + ring.


Medium - Open business?

Medium - Go to business school?

Medium - Look for another managing job or apply for loans and open my own spot.

Medium - Buy a home.

Long - Open Business.

My partner and I are definitely ""ready"" to wed and buy a house. But I still have some goals/reservations because I know that I want to get out of debt asap; and I feel like while I still have these student loans over my head I can't purchase a ring, and propose, and fund a wedding. However, I know I want to get married before starting the venture of my own business. So do I furlough our wedding to resolve my debt (which should take 3 years) or do I propose soon and get through both of our student debt together?

Input?

Edit: As a complete curve ball and proof that I'm feeling lost and incompetent. I am considering pivoting into a trade and trade school such as machining, metalworking, blacksmithing, or even woodworking.

In college I learned the basics of CNC machine programming; practiced glass blowing, wood working, forging, and welding. Furthermore, I did photography professionally for a couple years and web design professionally for a few years too.

Short story - booked a trip to Cancun, Mexico for April 13-18. The resort is closed from now until 5/15/2020 I’m guessing due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Am I entitled to a refund of my expenses? Or am I forced to take a credit to “reschedule at the same rate” as they’re calling it. 

Addition if this detail matters - I booked through Liberty travel. 

Side note - I’d love to go on this trip. It would be me and my wife’s last vacation being child free since she’s due in August. She’s also immuno-compromised on top of being pregnant.... and I also happen to be a nurse so I’m not really able to reschedule as it’s a risk we can’t afford to take.

fp7u5a,angelbabybee,Work reduced hours in half due to the corona virus. Really need advice on what to do.,"I have gone through all of my finances left to right and even with unemployment throwing in extra cash due to my lost wages, I will not make enough to make rent + my other bills. 

I am 20 years old, full time student and work full time. I moved out a year ago and have been doing well. However, I hurt my knee and it required surgery. ALL of my savings went to medical bills in addition to the monthly payments I am making on those bills. This was necessary as I could not walk due to the injury. I had to take work off for the surgery so I was on temporary disability. Also had to use my savings to make up for the money disability does not pay as they only pay about 60% of what you make. I just told myself I will build my savings back up again slowly but surely... and then corona hit. 

My parents are very set on not allowing their kids to move back in. I have never asked them for money ever. I did really well living on my own, even with the added medical bill payments. I thought I managed my money well but now here i am. 

I have enough for one more month of rent and utilities and then that's it. I asked my mom about temporarily moving back in until this virus clears up. Once my company is stable again and provides me with my normal hours, I will be able to move out again. I know my parents do not want me there, I do not want to invade on their space either. And I feel like a terrible example for my two younger sisters having to move back in. I am currently waiting on my mom to call me so we can talk about it. I am not sure what her response will be though, in fact I believe she will say no. Does anyone have any advice on what to do moving forward given my situation? I hate to say it, but I feel like such a failure. None of my other siblings lost their jobs or wages, just me. And my siblings who are moved out are all older than me and have a long-term boyfriend/husband to support them financially as well. I just have myself. I keep hearing things about a stimulus check, about bills being put on pause, etc, but none of that stuff is playing out in real time/in reality. My roommate has not lost his job and his name is the one under the house. He does not have any desire to ask the landlord about pausing rent payments or working with the utilities to pause payments temporarily since none of this is actually affecting him. I just feel so stuck. I feel like I have worked so hard to be where i am at and now it's falling apart. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Here are the highlights:

\-Direct payments of $1,200 to most individuals making up to $75,000, or $2,400 for couples making up to $150,000. Each dependent child increases the amount by an additional $500. The amount decreases for individuals with incomes above $75,000, and payments cut off for those above $99,000.

\-Expanded unemployment benefits that boost the maximum benefit by $600 per week and provide laid-off workers their full pay for four months. Eligibility is extended to independent contractors and the self-employed.

\-$367 billion in loans for small businesses

\-$150 billion for state and local governments

\-$130 billion for hospitals

\-$500 billion in loans for larger industries, including $25 billion for passenger airlines; $4 billion for carriers; $3 billion for aviation contractors and $17 billion for ""businesses critical to maintaining national security.

\-Creation of an oversight board and inspector general to oversee loans to large companies

fp7qqg,indigofire1o8,Defaulted on car loan. What to do now?,"I will be calling my lien holder tomorrow and figure out what to do next...in the meantime, I have so many thoughts in my head about whats going on.


I, (21 yo), am a full time student, taking home only around $800 a month from my job.
I have no intentions of increasing my hours at my job due to personal circumstances.

I started leasing this car when I had no knowledge of becoming a student and was working a 9-5 office job, taking home a really good paycheck.
Ended up leaving to focus on my studies.

Unfortunately, being ignorant and having no one to guide me, at 19 yo, i bought a $14k car, but with a 11% apr.. i barely even knew what APR even meant at that time...it is a 6 year loan, so with interest and extended warranty, the cars total is roughly around $20k.

For the past year, I have been struggling to pay off the car and had multiple deferments on my payments to the point where they wont offer any more deferrments. 
Credit is also bad, so I cant trade in the car or pull an additional loan out to sell the car and pay off remaining balance.

Ok so thats the backstory.
Now I know repossession is brutal. It ruins your credit for 7 years, you can get sued, car sells at auction for a minimal price and you owe the deficient balance. 

But with all of this in mind, if I do get my car repossessed, it will be a huge relief for my finances at the moment.
I did read on an attorney webpage that it will be hard for me to have any action taken if I am sued(ie wage garnishment,etc) if I literally don't have any assets.

I am an independent on my taxes, I own no property and I am making less than $1k a month.
Also, if this goes to collections, I have dealt with this before and I can set up a payment plan that will be  lot less than the payments I was making on my car every month.

Also, I am not too worried about my credit report being affected at the moment. I am a sophomore in undergraduate school and still have around 6 more years in school. I wont be needing to worry about buying a house or a brand new car anytime soon during the time this negative mark will be on my report.

I am just kind of ranting at the moment. Maybe to hear additional input. But to be honest. I am relieved in a weird way.
I made a stupid decision that made me end up in a stupid situation. I am just glad its happening while I am still young and dont have much to lose while learning a really tough yet valuable lesson in finances.
I was struggling every single month trying to pay off this car payment + other fees like insurance and maintence to the point of depression. 

But anyways, just wanted to see if anyone has been through this, or maybe can offer some guidance on what to do next or what to look out for in the future.

Unfortunately, we ran into some issues early in the process that set us back a few months, but we managed to get back on pace and with the 3 month extension, it looked like we would be OK. 

Until this week when everything is now shut down for at least 2 weeks due to covid...and likely will be for a bit longer. Along with the fact that suppliers and subs are also being affected as well as county services (such as inspections). 

We did contact our loan agent with the bank but they were insistent that in their interpretation of our governor's orders, construction is essential so our contractor should carry on. We disagree, and as of today, it looks like our governor also disagrees. 

So, we're hoping the bank accommodates us given the unprecedented situation we are all in. 

But, if they don't...do we have any recourse? Is there anything we can or should be doing in case we get to the point where the bank says ""time's up"" without the house being completed fully? Is it common for banks to just yank the property away for themselves or do they usually accommodate unforeseen issues and typically give people a bit of leeway?

fp7b7z,buttersideupordown,"Changing careers and can't decide between accounting, finance, law, or IT?","Hi all! I've basically had a bit of a quarter life melt down because  followed what I thought was my passion and did theatre as an undergrad, then filmmaking, and am realising now there's very little money or hope involved in either. 

I realised I really am not that creative (I thought I was, turns out I was better at analysing why something IS creative), and even good works were just insanely difficult and cliche to churn out. I also have little in the way of motivation considering I would be working for nothing for so much of the time. And considering the amount of work that goes into it with no guarantee of selling, distributing or being chosen, I realised I could have spent all that time, money, and effort in chasing a career that has actual upwards mobility and a clear career progression. I would prefer to work, and then pursue the fine arts as a hobby in my spare time (and actually have money to pay for it...)

My options:

1. Do postgraduate in accounting, then my CA.
2. Do postgraduate in finance, then my CFA.
3. Do postgraduate in IT and work in IT. 
4. Do JD in law and become a barrister.

My background: female, 26, communication skills, undergraduate degrees and experience in fine arts and liberal arts (theatre, and filmmaking). No prior degrees in maths or sciences. (Stupid yeah). 

My concerns: Wanting stability, wanting money, (I have spent too many years wallowing in poverty as a wannabe artist and I realised I need money to feel stable, secure, and to live a good life), not too much creativity, would prefer more by the numbers and 1+1=2, not talk your way out of it and therefore nothing is certain. 

Things to note: 

1. I am interested in law, because I am quite good at humanities, but there apparently is very little actual work and too many law graduates?
2. IT seems to be ever growing in terms of jobs but I have never done any work in it. And apparently there are whiz kids in programming or engineering etc? I doubt I have that capacity. 
3. Accounting and finance seem like they are the most stable?

Now is obviously the time, but rates are making crazy moves every day. Some say rates will continue to trend up because of supply constriction and demand increase. Others say rates will continue to go down. 

I have a 699 credit score due to a 31 day late payment for something stupid that I forgot about. House is 200k and I want to take out 250 to do some  remodels and consolidate debt. 

I owe my parents 200 for the house, which is currently valued around 300-325. I've put about 50k into remodels already. So there is plenty of equity in the house. I make about 72k per year and my wife makes between 7-12k per year as a part time mom/fitness instructor, and have calculated that with expenses I can afford an 1800/month rent payment

Quicken offered me a 30 year fixed for 4.06% with 1675/ month payments. It's the best I've seen from the several lenders I spoke with. some local some national. I already locked my rate on the Friday before they started the large increases.


My options are -

Get the loan now

Let the loan run its 45 day course and try to get a lower rate. 

Cancel the loan, pay the fee, and wait another 6 months to see which way rates go

Sell the house, take my 40k and try to find another house. There are many reasons that I like this house. Schools, neighborhood, proximity, etc. Other than the small bedrooms and closets. We love everything about it. It does however need another 25-50k of long term cosmetic work to be in pristine condition, or for max market value, which my realtor estimates is currently 350-400k depending on how extensive I want to get. 

That's assuming the market is still stable at the time of sale. And nothing breaks in the house during that time.

As well I'm 17 and haven't made a bank account/checking account or whatever yet. So right now for hosting the server, it has to go to him, but developing everything has gone to me. And because he's the only one with a bank account right now, there's nothing stopping him from pocketing the money. What I'm looking for is possibly a way to get donations from someone and automatically split the money between us? I don't know if anything close to that is possible. I'm also trying to convince my parents to get me a checking account which will hopefully happen very soon.

* I bring in about $1100 a week after taxes and a 20% 401k contribution.

fp5zjb,darkbyrd,Should I refinance my home? (long),"I bought my house end of 2014 with my long time girlfriend at the time. We split up due to her infidelity 18 months ago, and I have remained a resident of the house. While we lived together in the house, she exclusively paid the mortgage while I went to school (we could afford the house because I provided for her while she went to school). I provided the down payment of $8k. At the time of our separation, we calculated that her half of the equity was about $5k, and she stated she would be happy to receive that and walk away from the property. Legally, we own the house together ""Joint ownership with right of survivorship.""

We bought the house for $136k. It has appreciated to a market value of I guess$140k-$145k (I asked a real estate agent, it was hard to get a comp. Zillow estimates $174, but that seems excessive). Current balance is $117, 4.25%, PMI was paid up front at closing.

To get her to the table, I'd have to have the $5k to give her. I don't have that cash, so it would have to come out of the equity. There's also the chance that when I sell, she gets savvy and demands her half of the equity when she sees what I'm getting for the property. Otherwise, I'm in no hurry to take her name off the mortgage, and she's not hounding me to do this. 

There is a fair chance that I will be looking to sell in 3-5 years in a seller's market to relocate, but this is not assured. 

I'm seeing rates as low as 3.5% for a 30yr. I don't know that I want to swing the payments for a 15 yr. Currently pay $760 with a take home of $3200/mo, minimal unsecured debt and modest car loan, but also single father of a teenager.

I also don't have cash for closing, that would also have to come out of equity.

fp5uqo,coonsquad6,Higher mortgage rate vs. higher one time refund,"Hi all,

Looking for some validation on my thought process here and to see if I'm understanding everything the pros and cons of my options on a mortgage rate with a refund

Details:

Mortgage - 700k, 30 year fixed

Options -

* 3.5% rate with a .1% rebate on mortgage amount = $700 refund at $3,143 monthly
* 3.75% rate with a 1.35% rebate on mortgage amount = $9450 refund at $3,242 monthly
At this rate, if I opt for the higher rebate, it would take 88 months before the higher interest rate will outweigh the higher refund amount.

($9450 - $700) / ($3,243 - $3,143) = 88 months

I'm leaning for the higher rate due to the refund amount because I'm assuming I can refinance back to the 3.5% rate within 88 months.

Can someone help confirm the following risks of going this route, and point out anything I'm missing here?

* Rates don't go down within the 88 months and I lose more money to interest
* Refi costs reduce the 88 month break even point that will effectively lower my initial refund",5,1585200007,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp5uqo/higher_mortgage_rate_vs_higher_one_time_refund/,personalfinance,1

fp5q7s,--Ty--,"I'm a 24 year-old who is self-employed, doing seasonal work. I'm starting to worry that I won't get much business this summer, given the pandemic. What should I do?","Hello everyone,

I'm a 24 year old engineering graduate, doing contracting work under my own name. I've done this for two summers now, and so far, have not made enough in a year to reach the point where I need to register my business (I live in Canada, where the cutoff is 30k).

My work is stuff like carpentry, metalworking, landscaping, etc.; things that usually cost a lot to the client. Given what's happening in the world, though, people will be much more financially strained this year, and as such, far fewer people will be opting to renovate their homes.

So I'm starting to worry that I might not be able to find very much work this year. At least, not enough to net 23k.

I say 23k because that is the outstanding principle of my student line of credit with my bank. The loan is currently not in repayment, and so I only have to pay interest on the 23k each month. By the end of this August, though, the loan IS switching to repayment, and I'll be forced to pay around 450 a month. This wouldn't have been a problem if this summer was as good as last year's, but now I'm not so sure. 

Seeing as I'm self-employed though, I don't qualify for the various financial relief services being offered. EI, for example, requires proof of hours worked over the past 12 months. I have no such proof, as I have no such records (except for my hours billed to my clients?) 

I know this post is very vague, but I'm just looking for any helpful recommendations people have. My father has a compromised immune system, so contracting coronavirus would likely be a literal death sentence. As such, I can't just go out and get a retail job come May. My landscaping work is done alone, and as such, is far safer for my family, than having me work a job where I'm interacting with people.

Any and all commentary and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1,1585199388,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp5q7s/im_a_24_yearold_who_is_selfemployed_doing/,personalfinance,1

I'm not bothered about recieving a $1200 check, because that doesn't even pay one month of mortgage for most of us.

That would take a massive burden off the people in most need whole we navigate this chaos.

But reading this bull, it seems they've only done this to 'federally back mortgages'. 

As someone with a conventional loan (when I got my mortgage I just did what the broker told me, I had no idea there was even a difference), am I just fucked now?

I called chase and they said they won't help me until I've missed 3 months of payments. At which point my credit is fucked and I'm in debt...

fp5jca,killya01,"With the avg dental school debt being extraordinarily high, please explain your strategy to conquering this enormous debt when the interest is at its peak."," 

I have heard of many paths people have taken and the most prominent one sounds awful.

Less known: NHSC and HPSP scholarships: can't rely on them as getting in is ultra cutthroat competitive even with a 4.0 gpa and a 25 DAT.

Most prominent: paying around 4-5k per month of your 7k dental associate salary after taxes for 10 years. You would be living with around 2k to spare for living/gas/insurance/food/etc. Living with less to spend then a elementary school teacher after getting your dental degree is just a sad, humiliating thought, especially for 5-10 years.

Daunting path: right after graduation or a couple years after start your business by borrowing 500k on top of your ever growing 400k debt and hopefully pray that your business doesn't crash and you are not left without anything in the end.

What other paths are there or is this really how terrible the dental students situation is after they graduate? Maybe go to Europe for free dental school?? Can't find any information about it, so I assume it's not worth the effort.

Also not to mention that the 450k avg doesn't include cost of living. And for those who are interested, I am a CA resident, so the tuition here for in state is the same as most private out of state dental schools within the US

fp5i4v,killya01,"With the avg dental school debt being 400k, please explain your strategy to conquering this enormous debt when the interest atm is reaching 8%."," 

I have heard of many paths people have taken and the most prominent one sounds awful.

Less known: NHSC and HPSP scholarships: can't rely on them as getting in is ultra cutthroat competitive even with a 4.0 gpa and a 25 DAT.

Most prominent: paying around 4-5k per month of your 7k dental associate salary after taxes for 10 years. You would be living with around 2k to spare for living/gas/insurance/food/etc. Living with less to spend then a elementary school teacher after getting your dental degree is just a sad, humiliating thought, especially for 5-10 years.

Daunting path: right after graduation or a couple years after start your business by borrowing 500k on top of your ever growing 400k debt and hopefully pray that your business doesn't crash and you are not left without anything in the end.

What other paths are there or is this really how terrible the dental students situation is after they graduate? Maybe go to Europe for free dental school?? Can't find any information about it, so I assume it's not worth the effort.

Also not to mention that the 450k avg doesn't include cost of living. And for those who are interested, I am a CA resident, so the tuition here for in state is the same as most private out of state dental schools within the US

fp56tn,CarbonPrinted,Company cut our pay by 10% with less than 24 hour notice - What can we do?,"On Sunday, we received a company wide memo stating that, effective Monday, we were to receive a 10% pay decrease to help with impacts due to COVID-19 outbreak. This impacts everyone from our field workers to the executive team, and additional layoffs were done for nonessential personnel. 

Now, due to the stimulus package, the people who were laid off will be OK (and I was so relieved to find out they'll be taken care of). However, the rest of the company is now making 10% less with no commitment from management to a) restore the 10% reduction once this situation has passed b) offer a bonus payment if all jobs continue successfully over the course of this outbreak. For me, this is a loss of approximately $320 a month, dropping take home from about $2700 to $2500 a month (and all my bills usually come to about $2200 for EVERYTHING).

I do have an emergency fund setup for events like this, but it's not enough to cover an unexpected decrease in pay. I am in Colorado, and the costs are pretty high. I do not have a partner to help split bills, and I've already taken necessary steps to reduce bills - Turning off heat during the day, cut all unnecessary subscription or payments, deferred car loan for 3 months, contacted credit card companies and redid the budget to account for these changes. I am also looking into part time work for weekends/evenings to supplement my income and am looking for full time work as I know this cut is not sustainable long-term. We were allowed to opt into part time work and apply for unemployment to assist us as our hours were cut, but that could be detrimental long term if things change or get worse. HR currently is ""working through stuff"" and is not responding to our requests for our employment contracts.

We are in Colorado, an at-will employment state, and just received our lock down notice night of 3/25. Besides doing what I've done, or considering leaving that company, is there anything else that can help? I am fortunate to have a job, and the stimulus package will help too, but I'm worried about the long-term situation.

tl;dr - Company unexpectedly cut pay to all employees by 10% with no backup plan - What additional steps can be done to make it through this?",10,1585196804,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp56tn/company_cut_our_pay_by_10_with_less_than_24_hour/,personalfinance,1

fp520w,sourwoodmercantile,Scammy private parking ticket sent to collections,"Please redirect me if there’s a better sub for this question. 

My wife’s car is titled under her mom, who gave her the car several years back. We live in Denver. Last year, she got an official-looking ticket left on her windshield after parking in a lot in the city. The ticket looked fishy, turns out it was a “private ticket.” My wife swears there was no signage stating it was a pay lot (or any other signage), and a google search shows this type of behavior is a common practice for [this company.](https://m.yelp.com/biz/stop-n-park-denver) (My wife later found out from someone who works nearby that it’s a permit lot, hence no payment stall).

So we didn’t pay it.

Fast forward six months or so. We get a letter in the mail from a collections company who has been “assigned” the debt (now almost double the original “fine”). The address was off by a digit but still made it to us. And it was addressed to my wife’s mom (who can lookup license plate info?).

I don’t want to make a pain in the ass for my MIL, but I also have strong feelings about companies taking advantage of people - and I hate being taken advantage of. And this particular company seems to have a record of illegal, predatory [business practices.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.9news.com/amp/article/news/local/9news-evenings/denver-takes-steps-to-stop-illegal-towing-downtown/73-334127356) 

My understanding is that the Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes that this debt couldn’t be reported to a credit bureau because there’s no written contract. The company would have to request a judge hear their case (as a plaintiff) and make a ruling. Sounds like a lot of work that wouldn’t happen over a $40 ticket.


Do I swallow my pride and eat the fine? Continue ignoring it? If it were my name on the envelope I’d absolutely fight tooth and nail out of principle. But I don’t want to make a headache for my MIL and ask her to get involved writing letters, etc.

fp515z,joshecf,Landlords offering 3 months half rent but we have to pay it off by the end of the year.,"Due to COVID 19 all four guys renting a house have lost our jobs. I got in touch with our landlord to explain the situation and see what we can work out. They offered us to pay half the rent for three months but that by the end of the year we would have to pay back what we owe.

Now, we are in Washington State so we can't legally be evicted right now but their deal still seems too burdening to us. While the three months of half rent are a great help we have no idea how the economy will be or if we will be back to making the same amount we were before. So paying 1.5x rent for three months seems like something we may not be able to do. At least not easily.

Should we try to negotiate a lower rent or something else with our landlords? I know that they are also in a tough situation since they still have mortgages to pay so I don't want to make them out to be villains in this scenario but I still feel like they could work with us a little more.

Last year we bought an investment property in MA, listed it on Airbnb and my wife manages the rentals. Based on the amount of time she puts in, she legitimately meets the Real Estate Professional qualifications.

If my wife takes the election as a Real Estate Professional, then all of those losses can be used to offset my W2 income on our federal return. However, for state purposes: my W2 income is in NY, and the loss from the rental is in MA. So there's nothing in MA to offset (other than a tiny amount of rental income) and the state return will be left with a big net loss.

So I have an opportunity to apply for my state’s fire academy.

This accelerated class pretty much guarantees a job at a big department which means the pay is good. The exact price is not released yet, but rumors are going around that it’s around 15k. I do not have 15k in cash right now being that I am in the middle of my freshman year of college, so the only option really is a loan. My student debt is less than 5k because I am going to a community college. I understand that some of you.. probably most of you would be against this, but this is the career path I would like to take and I would like to hit the ground running as soon as possible because the clock for retirement would start ticking away. Anyways, I have made up my mind and would like to ask some questions. 

What’s the first step I should take? Would these even be considered student loans? Should I go through my local credit union?

Is there a chance that my refinance will fall through because of my leave? I am returning to work, and have already provided bank statements to the lender showing more than enough money to cover the closing costs and several months of payments.

fp3vjp,Extra_Negotiation,"My GF's CC statement shows $0 owing, $0 balance - but she owes $10K in a 'control' account? Is this a scam?"," Originally, I thought this was a scam. Now I'm not so sure.

My Gf has a small business (sole proprietor). Her annual income is \~30K. She does art and media stuff.

She  has a business bank account with Meridian credit union. They encouraged  her to get one of their credit cards, to keep everything neat and tidy,  'no stress at all' type scenario.

She pays her balance every month. She's diligent with her finances.

She  showed me her statement for this month - sure enough, expenses \~$500,  paid \~500, shows 0 balance, full credit available, etc.

Then  today, she gets a 'different' statement than she is used to. It looks  every so slightly different, and there's one significant difference:

**A 9K and change bill owing on it!**

WTF? I thought it was a scam immediately.

She called the bank (and I matched the number on her card to the number on  her statement to be sure), and apparently, they have some back end  system variant, where the account she has been accessing is not the  'control' account. Meaning, there are somehow two accounts for this  credit card. Likely a business thing - you can issue multiple cards,  have separate charges to them, whatever.

The 'control' account has a 10K limit - her card, and she remembers signing for this, has a 3K limit.

Some  time ago, somehow, a statement passed her by. This is possible because  she had a month+ long pretty serious illness due to work, and she  travels for work a lot, so currencies and fees always mess with the  numbers. Somehow, the 'actual' amount owing was never told to her over  all this time - it was likely 1 or 2 thousand dollars. All her  statements have shown 0 owing, 0 balance, etc.

Interest  has just been piling up ever since, for years, at a different interest  rate than even her normal card statement says she has (higher, of  course). So this 1-2 has become 9K. Nobody ever called, nobody ever  asked any questions.

Obviously,  she's freaking out. She has the money (quite a bit more than that), in  her business account with the bank, but it's a huge hit at a time when  things are getting weird for all of us.

Things in her favour:

* She  has more than enough in her business account to cover the bill, and has  consistently. There's no logical reason she wouldn't have paid it.
* She  has consistently paid exactly the amount owing on her balance that she  received. She has months (and soon, after a bank visit, years) of  statements showing exact to the penny payments. Clearly the intent is  here.

Things not in her favour:

* This  is still her card, and still her account, and somewhere along the way  somebody might have messed up, but it's her business and she should be  double checking.

**What is the best way to challenge this interest? Is there anything she can do?**",5,1585191115,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp3vjp/my_gfs_cc_statement_shows_0_owing_0_balance_but/,personalfinance,1

fp3t4j,TehHobbitz,Applied for a loan &amp; found about a late payment on my credit reprt,"I’m in the process of applying for a HELOC with my mortgage holder. When they ran my credit they asked about a late payment that showed up on my credit report, but I honestly had no idea what they were talking about.  It was with my Credit Union that I have my checking/savings with, so I called them up and found out the story. 

It was related to my oldest kids account that was a custodian account that turned into a normal member account when he turned 18. My custodian rights turned into joint rights. Needless to say the account was over drafted by $22. This evidently went on long enough it went to the credit union collections. It was eventually paid when my son went to open a new account with them (don’t ask why he opened a new one because I have no idea) and they refused until the $22 was paid. So the debt was settled.   When I spoke with them they confirmed the account was paid &amp; closed and this shouldn’t be showing up on my credit report. 

So I began filing disputes with all 3 credit agencies and I’m waiting for those to go through the process. My credit union assured me once they got the dispute they would provide the necessary information to get this cleared up and removed from my report.  My loan officer is now asking for a “letter of explanation” on the late payment, which I assume is normal and hopefully something I can easily get. 

This is frustrating for me because I never received anything from them that the account was overdrafted let alone it was going to collections and worse going to affect my credit. $22 is nothing and something I would have paid instantly.  Hopefully this is easy to fix and will come clean off my credit report and more importantly doesn’t hold up the loan process.  Part of me is upset with my credit union (I’ve been a member for 15+ years) and my knee jerk reaction is to take my business elsewhere. I’m sure the being made a joint member on the account is in the fine print, but I’m upset I never got any notice. This happened 2 years ago!  

Is this a huge problem? Can I trust that they will resolve the dispute and it will come off my credit report?  Changing banks is a big bunch of hassle and I’d cut ties with them 100% which would include paying a loan off early (just how I am when I’m done doing business with you).",4,1585190837,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp3t4j/applied_for_a_loan_found_about_a_late_payment_on/,personalfinance,1

Home 2 loan was approved only because be didnt mention that he had an existing liability which was Home 1. His debt to income would not have qualified him for a second home loan.

Fast forward eight months later to today he gets a letter from the broker saying that Fannie Mae did an audit and found undisclosed liability at the time that would have made his debt income ratio very high therefore he must pay back the full loan in 15 days, which is $400k..

fp2sjm,commonlaw12,I can't figure out why Chase reduced my mortgage rate.,"Right now I have a 3.875% 30-year non-conforming jumbo mortgage with Chase that I took out in June 2017.  When interest rates started dropping in January/February, I called up my mortgage broker at Chase, who was able to match a rate a CU was offering at 3.5% with only a few hundred of closing costs.  I locked that in and preceded to underwriting, and was ultimately approved.  As of a few days ago, our closing was supposed to take place on April 5.  The Chase broker calls me up today and says I will be getting a letter in the mail today offering, instead of the refi, to do a mortgage modification of my existing mortgage down to 3.25%, no closing costs.  He says this came down from his bosses, he doesn't understand why they are doing it and that he has never seen this happen before.  He said the offer is generally going out to Chase customers with non-conforming loans in the refi pipeline.  I check my mail today, and there is the offer letter as promised.

Aside from celebrating my good luck (knocks about $200 off my P&amp;I a month), I am trying to figure out why Chase did this?  I think my existing mortgage is on their books, so maybe they like the credit there? The whole thing is confusing to me.

fp2qsy,Arp590,Lease back agreement - seller staying longer," 

So this was a very hot house with several competing offers, as part of our offer we included that the seller could have up to 30 days occupancy after close, due to him needing to find a place.

The seller is paying me $45/day to stay at the house, he originally said he only needed 3-5 days, but a deal fell through on wherever he was planning to move to.

Not that big of a deal, he said he needed a more couple weeks.

Well now with the Coronavirus going on &amp; our state on lockdown, the seller is having difficulty moving into a new place.

The realtor is saying that the seller might have to stay longer than our 30 day agreement, and with the new rules in place you can't really evict someone right now. On April 1st I have to begin paying daily rent at my current place of $44/day.

Question- how much should I reasonably ask the seller to pay me to stay at the house past the 30 day deadline? The $45/day he is currently paying covers a little more than the mortgage/insurance taxes, but now i'm having to pay daily rent at my current place which is more expensive than the mortgage payment.

This is becoming a major inconvenience, as my state is on lock-down &amp; I would like to be in the house I purchased during this time rather than this small apartment. We've also packed up the majority of our apartment weeks ago because we were told he would be out very quickly.

On top of income limits, the formula for figuring out your reduced contribution amount for a Roth IRA is so stupidly over-complicated I couldn't help but laugh out loud at the sheer ridiculousness of it. Seriously, what possible reason could there be to have such a formula in place?

fp2b1p,reporterreporter,Exempt vs nonexempt," 

Hi all,

I've got a question about exempt vs. nonexempt classifications. I recently moved to start a new job as a salaried employee. After filing my first timecard, which had a few hours of overtime, my employer has informed me that they mistakenly sent a job offer that listed me as ""nonexempt"" and are saying I need to sign an updated offer where I'm listed as ""exempt.""

But I don't think I qualify as exempt under the FLSA. I do meet the minimum requirements for a salaried employee, but I don't qualify for the highly compensated employee as I don't make $107k a year (per 2019 numbers).

I'm not involved in the management of the company, nor do I manage anyone in the office. I don't work in a professional role, I'm not a computer programmer or anything like it. I don't meet the outside sales test. I'm not in a position to receive any bonuses, either.

So, can I be considered exempt? Is it possible for a US company to decide I'm exempt, even if I don't meet the FLSA standards for an exempt employee?

Many thanks.",13,1585184826,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp2b1p/exempt_vs_nonexempt/,personalfinance,1

fp1zoo,westfallen,"30k student loans, 10k credit card debt, no degree and no opportunities in my area","Hello everyone,

I am writing this in hopes that someone could help me figure out what I need to do to get above water with my finances. Last year I quit my 30k+ a year ITS job in hopes to come back to my hometown to reconnect with family and heal my mental health. I was offered a job at a contracted company for FedEx Ground, with the hopes that I could make up to 1.5 times what I was making at my old job (which is what my friend was making at the time I took the job). I took the opportunity and quickly found out how hard it is to work for a poorly managed contracted company. Soon after moving all of my finances tanked, and they continued this way through peak season even. At my best pay, I was hardly making even. I originally quit school to take the ITS job I had mentioned, as it was a state position and had great benefits.

Fast forward to this year, I quit my job as I was making less than minimum wage hours wise, despite making $14 an hour. It was also a very toxic environment, to the point that my routine mechanic work on my vehicle was put on the back burner, despite the very hazardous roads I drove on (rural area, icy roads next to a deadly river in the middle of nowhere). My plan was to take up a minimum wage job until this summer, where I would withdraw all my savings or retirement or whatever I could manage so I could move out of this town (no opportunities aside from minimum wage jobs). Unfortunately, I have locked myself down because of our national emergency and I recently just pulled the rest of my retirement simply to live.

Now I don't know what to do. I have bad teeth, an old car, credit card debt sucking away all my income and 30k student debt that is currently on deferment. I have no idea what I want to do for a career, I only know what I want to do as hobbies. I love to cook and I have an interest (not a huge one, mind you) to do wildlife photography and draw. None of these will provide me with enough money to pay off my debt. I don't know what to do. I applied for the only IT position in 100 miles and I haven't heard a single thing back in over a month. I never received a degree, and the only reason I ever got my IT job was because I worked there as a student and worked my way up the ladder. I have no certificates. I feel like I'm at a dead end.

My first payment came in today and it was $84,000.  I'm losing 25% to my reps and lawyer's commission fees, and then I'm paying off $10k in credit card debt.

fp1hje,WhatevrBrahLetsBlade,Please help me figure out how to get myself out of this mess,"Guys, I need help. I feel like a huge idiot for letting this problem get so big. I feel a lot of shame and dread and hopelessness when looking at the numbers of how much debt I have. It feels so insurmountable that I've just been avoiding dealing with it at all/pretending the problem doesn't exist, which just makes it snowball. I'm sure many of you can relate. Maybe some of you can help me get myself out of this mess?

Here are the numbers:

CREDIT CARD DEBT:

* Chase credit card: $332.15
* US Bank credit card: $6,030.98
* Discover credit card: $9,122.2
* Capital One credit card: $817.75

OTHER DEBT:

* Car loan: $5,328.42
* Student loans for graduate school (which fortunately don't need to be repaid right now. Payments will start this December): $19,010
* Debt from an intensive outpatient program: $1000

I make $2300 per month after taxes as a preschool teacher. I'm in graduate school to become a BCBA, which should greatly increase my income once I become credentialed. Here are my current monthly expenses (not including variable expenses like food, hygiene products, clothes, or going out):

* Rent: $645
* Utilities: $70
* Car insurance: $87
* Car payment: $175
* Gas: $100
* Coin laundry: $40
* Therapy and medication: $255
* Subscriptions (hulu, netflix, spotify, Adobe, iCloud): $55
* Payment for my medical debt: $167
* And of course, minimums for my credit cards.

I have like $600 in my checking account right now, and no savings. I'm recovering from a lot of mental health symptoms currently and these symptoms have definitely contributed to my debt in the past. For example, depression and a tendency to deal with negative emotions with binge eating created a habit of Postmating food often. I'm getting better at developing new coping skills, and definitely realize I need to cut back my spending on food in order to deal with this mountain of debt.

fp1for,nmott88,"Sister and I inherited 401k account, Fidelity can’t give us a straight answer; advice needed.","My Father passed away two years ago, which led to my Sister and I inheriting his 401k. She, being the responsible sibling, got her account setup and funds dispersed. She made sure to ask if the funds had been segregated and let them know I would be setting up an account as well. 
They assured her that the funds would be segregated and she withdrew her share, approximately $6000. 

Fast forward a year and a half, I set my account up with fidelity. My account had $16,000 in it. My sister then suddenly had a new account with 16,000 in it.  We called Fidelity on a 3 way call to get some clarification. We want to know if I should’ve had another account with $6,000 in it, etc. They couldn’t give us an answer, other than at some point, my Dad’s former employer changed their 401k provider, this happened during the gap between my Sister and I setting up our accounts. Fidelity promised to look into it and get back to us. 
Fast forward a month, Fidelity hasn’t gotten back to us. My sister called everyday for two weeks, and still couldn’t get a straight answer. 

Which brings us to the present day, we’ve spent multiple hours on the phone with Fidelity. They’re customer service is cumbersome to navigate and we’re tired of explaining this story repeatedly to a new customer service rep. I think that they’re  just hoping we’ll give up, which is an option we’ve considered. That is why I’m writing my first reddit post, maybe someone out there can help me get to the right person at Fidelity, or give me some advice on how to get their attention. I get that this is a super complicated issue and not that much money, but I feel like Fidelity should be able to clear this up and they’re just giving us the run around. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

fp1a1i,NoSpice4Me,"Retirement, Student Loan Debt, Emergency Fund, Education, Down Payment? – Can’t Do It All","Hi everyone,

I consider myself to be pretty financially stable, but with recent events I realize that I would like to eliminate my liabilities more quickly, but I am having a difficult time letting go of funding my retirement in favor of building an emergency fund and leaving debt more quickly. My situation is a little different than most people’s, so a lot of advice I’ve found doesn’t make as much sense (such as Dave Ramsey’s snowball method, since I have \*one\* source of debt).

Important things to know:

**25F, single, living in Boston, avid YNABer.**

**Last year:** Salary was \~55k, I contributed the full $6k to my ROTH IRA, refinanced my private loan (again) to get a lower interest rate. I contributed nothing to an emergency fund but never lacked for money or dealing with emergencies like an ER visit and ongoing weekly physical therapy for a few months.

**This year so far:** Salary will be just shy of 60k. On track to make $6k ROTH IRA contribution, satisfied with private loan (switched to biweekly payments, taking an additional $50/mo beyond minimum payment), began emergency fund. Current emergency fund is at $1.5k. 

**Beyond:** I am guaranteed a COL adjustment and a roughly 3% salary increase each year, so as of right now my salary will cap out at $80k/yr without any change in education status. A second masters’ is a 5k/yr salary bump while a CAGS or PhD is a 10k bump over my current salary step, but I cannot complete a CAGS or PhD without taking a leave of absence from teaching. I can complete a second masters’ while maintaining my job. I do not forsee myself leaving my job or the field of education anytime soon. I recently started a relationship, but nothing serious yet and am not planning on having biological children (but am not opposed to fostering or adoption given my field).

**What prompted change**

My job just announced a surprise partnership with Landed to support teachers in saving for down payments and home ownership is a distant goal of mine, which means I need to A) get out of debt faster and B) be prepared for emergencies. I am also thinking about moving up the salary ladder, which requires me to complete a second masters’ degree or a CAGS/PhD (lmao?) that I would have to pay for out of pocket. The CAGS is a better choice for our salary ladder but does not make sense for my career goals and is less attainable. Meanwhile, after many disappointing searches I have finally identified an excellent option for a second masters’ that would cost $7500 at worst that I could do over the summer and over a few years. 

My goals were just starting to shift when suddenly COVID-19 appeared. It has understandably rattled me, even though my job Is extremely secure. I would like to save one month’s salary as an emergency fund for now given the stability of my job, then move on to my next goal.

Regardless, the reality is I can’t do all of these things (retirement, pay student loan faster, save a down payment, save an emergency fund, possibly save for more schooling) at the same time, especially when my IBR payments go back up in November/December. Due to COVID, I am also no longer saving for some of my wishes (a trip to Canada and NYC this summer). Basically, I now have a \~6 month window to aggressively put my ducks in a row before life returns to normal.

**Financials**

**Monthly Net Pay: $3423 + 2 month lump sum payment in June (I am a teacher, so I get four paychecks at the end of June and that is my July and August “pay”)**

**Debts:**

**Federal loan: $10/mo,** $72k @ 5.2% (mostly GradPLUS). Unusually low because for the tax year this was calculated in I had only worked for 3 months, but will go up around November/December. I received my PSLF certification in the mail recently to confirm that I am paying correctly towards forgiveness**. PSLF forgiveness date is December 2028.**

**Private loan (Earnest): $650/mo in biweekly payments,** balance is 60k @ 4.8%. Minimum payment is $600/mo. Payoff **December 2030.**

I hold no other debt, credit score is 760. Cards are paid in full at every billing statement.

Because of PSLF, there is nothing to snowball here. The only option is to put more money towards my loans or save.

**All Essential Monthly Expenses (includes loan payments, does not include retirement or emergency fund savings): $2800**

**The Decision:**

Basically, I have $600 each month to distribute between retirement savings, emergency fund savings, and paying off my private loan faster *right this very moment*. Previously, I had been putting $500 into my ROTH IRA and $100 into my emergency fund, but I suspect this course is not prudent anymore. 

If I throw all of this money towards my emergency fund (plus that $1200 check coming in the mail soon), I could fund a one month’s salary emergency fund and then go balls to the wall at my private loan for 5 years and knock it out, without saving much money for a down payment, retirement, OR more schooling. I think this would give me peace of mind but I would also be missing out on some extra pay. 

A third option is to aggressively fund an emergency fund, then pay a little bit extra ($100/mo) towards my loans while also saving aggressively and paying to begin a second masters’. I could start this summer and have 5 years to finish but could do so sooner.

Compared to most other people my age, I can afford financial risk: I am a teacher in an extremely high-demand subject and very happy with my job (and if this changes, could get a new job tomorrow), am up for tenure next year (with no indication that I will not receive it), and have seniority in my department. Still, one can never be too cautious, especially in these times.

How would you attack this situation?

I went to the ER at the beginning of February for some intense back pain I was having. I was there no more than two hours and they took some X-rays and gave me a shot of morphine and sent me on my way. 

Fast forward to last week, I get a bill in the mail for $1700 for the ER visit and then three other bills from the same ER visit from the different services or Doctors that helped adding up another $300. 

I have a decent insurance through work and from the statement they “paid” a portion of it because the total bill was on the high end of $7000 before any insurance came in. I called the billing department and asked them why it was so high and to send me a detailed itemized receipt (as I’ve seen other people here recommended) and they sent me a barely more detailed bill still asking for the same amount. 

I’m not really sure what I can do at this point to get that amount down or how to proceed with this. I’m still a student and can’t really afford to pay $2000 right now and even the $140 a month for the main $1700 is just an expense I can’t handle right now.

fp11bo,Angel_Konan,Have I stolen money?,"Before I started university, I told the guy I loved that I would give him money. I did not do it for a service nor did I sign any contracts. I wanted to help him financially because I cared about him. 

He did not support me going to university until I told him about the money. We worked out that I would have 8k spare each year and some of this was from a student loan. I knew it was a lot of money and that I would have to pay some of it back and so I only thought about giving him money in my first year. I didn't say that to him though and I let him think he would get 24k (he was just so happy). 

I had been giving him money throughout my first year and had actually exceeded £8000. Then in the summer when it was brought up I told him I don't intend to give him the rest and accepted I may have therefore lied to him. He then got really depressed and stressed as he was planning on moving out and needed the money on top of his earnings. I later compromised and agreed to give him money from my second year and told him that I believed he was getting enough notice to undo any plans he had for the money I'd have in final year. 

My feelings for him were far from what they were before I started university. We had a lot of problems in our relationship. I've so far given him 6k from second year and despite not wanting to give him anything anymore I will still give him the remaining 2k as promised. 

However that asshole is now claiming I owe him 10k and is threatening me for stealing money from him. You can't steal something that doesn't exist. I told him to owe must be in exchange for something received. His desperate response was that I received his time, friendship (at the time), his dominance, his knowledge and his skill set. He claims we had a verbal contract even though I had no legal intent. 

To me it's sort of similar to how people in love make all these promises for the future because they don't see their love ending, but when the divorce happens all their promises do come to an end. I know he is not in a good financial situation at the moment but it is not my problem anymore. He feels hurt by so many things I have done to him and the promise of money always kept him trying. The ungrateful, selfish psycho doesn't take responsibility for the things he has done to me though which I think has made me even more hurt. 

Anyway thanks for reading all of that. I would like it if people could tell me their honest thoughts on if he has any right to say I stole money from him.",14,1585180092,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fp11bo/have_i_stolen_money/,personalfinance,1

fp0zsn,lifehappens531,Someone totaled my parked car,"&amp;#x200B;

I had my car parked on the street and I noticed there was a paper on the window. I figured it was a ticket, but it was a note ""I'm sorry I hit you car, call me."" I look to the side and there's a hard hit. I immediately call the insurance company and the police. The police comes and recommends I call the number and see if I can work it out with the guy. The guy comes and he doesn't have insurance. Yes, I know it's honest to leave your information but here's the thing, he wanted a quick cheap fix and every auto body shop I went to quoted me a couple thousand dollars well above what he wanted to pay. Now the insurance marked the car as totaled and I still owe money to the lienholder. The guy who hit my car is now MIA.  


Now I have no car to get to work because the insurance only covers 3 days of rental, the insurance wants to lower the value of my car for imperfections, take the deductible cost and that will leave me with 80% to pay off my car loan. 

I have no proof the guy hit my car, the police station wants a mailed in police report which could take days (coronavirus precaution), and the insurance wants to mail the lienholder the paperwork which could take days to find out if I get the check or if it goes to them (again coronavirus precaution).   


I understand things happen in life, but what am I supposed to do now?

fp0zib,courcake,Opinions on employing $13k settlement in current economy?,"Hello! I am about a week away from getting a $13k settlement I’ve been waiting for, for over a decade. I am soliciting opinions about the best move for this money. 

I have a gov job making $90k/yr in HCOL area, so I’m not worried about losing my job, which I am extremely grateful for. 

I bought a townhouse in Nov 2019. The mortgage is $3800 at 4.75% interest, of which I pay $2400. Yes, this is a lot of money, but I am very frugal and place a high value on home ownership, my privacy, and the peace I feel while I am at home. 

I max my TSP and HSA already. I am 27F and have an aggressive risk tolerance, so I’m not worried about retiring any time soon. 

I currently have $20k in savings, $11.5k of which I have specifically in my refinance money pot. 

I have $18k in student loans and $16k in parent plus loans to pay back. The $18k I am not worried about because it has a low interest rate. I would like to attack the $18k soon due to high interest (6.5%) and to get it off my dad’s back. 

-—-—-

Now that that’s out of the way, I come to my dilemma and I would really appreciate the input of the hive mind: what should I do with this money given my situation? I am currently debating between refinancing and putting that money in the market. 

I can refinance to 2.875%, which would lower my mortgage to $3150, freeing up $650/month for 30 years, assuming I never get a raise my whole career. Over 30 years, this saves me $235k in payments—it’s hard not to look at this as a good move. I would use the $13k settlement and $11.5k savings to accomplish this. 
I can use that extra freed up income to pay off the parent plus loans, invest in the market, keep my favorite businesses from going under, etc.

Or I can put that $13k in the market immediately. It’s an excellent time to buy, but I don’t have to tell y’all about that!

What would you do in my shoes? Or is this just a stupid question and should I obviously refinance? I’m open to other ideas too.

So as the title says, I just turned 18 not too long ago and got a state job making $23k salary a year. Not too much AT ALL, mainly because it’s probationary but after a year I’m guaranteed to make $35k+ and it’s only up from there. 

I take home roughly $1400 monthly after ALL food expenses, housing, and entertainment. 

I was thinking of going with CARVANA because I heard you only have to be 18 and make $10k a year to be eligible.

Most other dealers just screw you over if you’re young with unreasonable interest and fees.

I have a FEW questions I hope you all can answer.

• Will CARVANA be a good option for me? I’ll be spending max $15k on a car from them with about $2.5-3k down. 

• I noticed most of the inventory of cars, even those that would go for $8-12k anywhere else are listed for $14-16k with CARVANA. Can anyone tell me why? 

• What should I expect my payment / insurance to be? I’m thinking $5-600 a month, total. Does that sound about right?

fozsly,A_Man_Underground,"Solo 401k, Traditional IRA, both, or something else for retirement?","Wife and I are in our mid-20s in NY, married filing jointly, roughly 200k combined this year; will very likely be 300-350k combined within the next 3 years. I am self-employed; she will be soon. Debt free, have sufficient emergency funds and about 100k in investments.   


So I don't qualify for a Roth IRA, and contributions to a traditional IRA wouldn't be tax deductible. I'm thinking a Solo 401k is most sensible for me right now, given the higher contributions as both employer/employee. Is the traditional IRA still worth it? Are there any other plans I should look into?

Now it's my understanding that once I reach a balance of $1000, I can invest any ADDITIONAL funds in it. Since I am only being furloughed, all my benefits stay active, just I am responsible for making my monthly payments, instead of the payroll deductions.

What I'm wondering, since it's kind of pointless to add to it without getting the pre-tax deduction, and I can't invest the initial $1000, if I'd be better off just withdrawing it for now and taking the tax hit, and starting over once I get back to work.

fozr6h,kelsa8lynn,"Before accepting payment deferment options, ask what happens afterward...","I called my bank today to ask about temporarily suspending my mortgage payments. I'm a small business owner and while I'm OK during this time, I was curious what the process was like or what they were offering. I'm also a financial coach and wanted to give my clients a head's up of what to expect if they were thinking of pursuing this option. 

I called and was informed that I could apply for a 90-day protection, which essentially meant no penalties, fees or negative credit reporting for 90 days. Sounds nice but...

**Concern #1: They wouldn't provide me with any documentation in writing until after I applied.**

I then asked about what happens after 90 days and the Customer Service Rep could not tell me. Granted, I do believe she simply doesn't know and this situation is new for many of us. 

I then asked ""What have you heard MIGHT happen after 90 days?""

She then said she's heard it's based off the investor of the loan so it will be up to them but she's heard of 3 possibilities:

1) The 3 payments get added to the back of the loan (essentially extending it for 3 months)

2) The amount missed gets added to the balance and is capitalized.

**3) You will have to make the back payments or be forced to do a loan mod.** 

That last option is troubling for a lot of people and I have a feeling they don't realize it until the time comes. She was not able to tell me if the interest rate would be different or what the modification would look like. For us, we have a great interest rate and a loan mod could result in a dramatic difference over the life of our loan as far as interest is concerned.

I chose not to move forward with the application until there's a more concrete plan or policy on how these will be handled on the back end (after 90 days). 

My concern is that a lot of people will not consider ""what's next"" when looking for help today with their financial stress. They will simply jump at the chance to postpone their largest bill - kicking the can down the street and possibly creating a bigger problem later.

Not every bank is the same so please make sure you encourage people to ASK what happens with these missed payments after 90 days. Be aware of the LONG-TERM impact as well as the SHORT-TERM with these kinds of things! 

There were so many loan mods back in '08 &amp; '09 that were disastrous for borrowers. Please let's not repeat that mistake with Coronavirus.",316,1585175592,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fozr6h/before_accepting_payment_deferment_options_ask/,personalfinance,1

And I know what will be said, it was a terrible decision for me to even consider this. I have terrible credit and am currently on quarantine amidst the Coronavirus, so my financial situation is not great. Not bad, but not great. Am registered for EI but will not be able to receive until mid-April, which does not help my current situation. 

I was looking for loans online, saw an ad for Fresh Start. I figured I'd try it. They called me, told me I was pre-approved, went through the whole phone conversation (giving them all of the information they wanted as I was serious about getting a loan and they kept reassuring me they would make it happen.)

Fast forward to an hour into the phone call, where I've been transferred to some guy who is talking to me about a 'savings loan' to help rebuild my credit. I tell him I'm not interested. He gets very aggressive, brings up my terrible history and why nobody will approve me for a loan besides them unless I sign up for this loan. (I get it, but like???? You want my business don't you?) I don't want a savings loan, and if I did, I would be reaching out to someone else. They told me they could get me something NOW which was the only reason I even went through with it. 

He repeatedly cuts me off midsentence, and at this point I get annoyed. I eventually just hang up on him. I have not signed any documentation, however they do have all of my information and I am worried in regards to what they can do with it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an intern and I live in the Middle East. Just graduated from high school and I don't make much, but it's something. I live with my mom and so far my internship stipend is our only assured source of money.  It's around $270 a month while our rent is $760 a month. My mom has been trying to get a job for years but it hasn't been working out. Compounded to the problem is the fact that we don't have passports because our country refuses to renew them. Pretty much staying here illegally. The thing is I am being considered for a full-time job, but I don't have any valid documentation that they can actually hire me with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm posting here is because we used to have a car on a short-term basis, but now we don't, and I have literally no clue how to get to work once the work-from-home period is over for us. Taxis are out of our budget and none of my neighbors are willing to drive me to work. And my workplace is not walking distance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of budget, I just don't make enough to cover rent. We need to buy food as well, but half of the $270 usually goes to groceries while the other half we try and save for rent. This isn't feasible at all and I've found myself hungry half the days of the month eating food from people at work or sneaking chocolates from the visitors' bowl. A lot of the money would go to paying for petrol as well, but now we don't have a car at all to go to work with. We had to resort to selling a bit of gold to make up for rent, but we barely have any of that left either.

fozef0,donutMind,Tax obligations on 'profits' before I was vested?,"Through my previous employer, I had a number of 'profit units' which had zero value until they vested. I left last month, well before any vesting period. As part of the original units agreement, if I left before vesting, they'd 'purchase' the units back for a total sum of $50.

However, in 2019 they made a profit and decided to reinvest that money back into the company, thus incurring the dreaded tax obligations of the K-1 schedule. So, now I apparently owe taxes (much greater than the $50) on this supposed earning, even though I'm a) no longer a 'member' and b) the company wants to buy back my units for $50 (I haven't signed the paperwork agreeing to the final $50 yet).

Any idea what my options are here? I think it's horribly unfair to owe taxes on something I never actually owned and saw no value from, and have avoided signing the legal document they just sent telling me they want to pay the $50.

Can I demand the value of the units, if I'm expected to pay taxes on them? Can I put the value of the units as a loss, if I have to pay taxes? Something else?

fozbmr,LevelBad,Should I finance or take a 401k loan.,"With all that is going on, I'm having a hard time making the decision I should've made months ago. Although I know it isn't my responsibility, I want to buy a used vehicle for my son and his gf. The y have been together since they were 14, now 23 and about 4.5 months pregnant. The vehicle he has is about to die and there is no reason to put any money in it, it's that bad (also a truck with no room for baby).

I can't decide if it's best to finance a vehicle or take out a loan from my 401k of about $7000. Apparently, I am an essential employee so I'm not worried about being layed off. And I know y'all will say never to borrow against your 401k, but right now does it even matter? The market is down, I've lost a chunk as expected. But on the other hand, if the vehicle is financed, it would be by his father. We are still living together, but it's a very toxic environment and I would have to hear about how his credit (that I built for him) got the vehicle every time he got mad (which is every 3.5 seconds). My credit is good, but I don't make enough to have 2 cars financed at a time, I just bought one 2 years ago.

So basically, do I suffer with his antics or compromise my 401K?

foym7h,GreyFecalMatter,Furloughed by company that still owes me 3 paychecks.,"For the last 18 months, I’ve been working for a small start-up software company as a developer. I haven’t been coding for long but the company was a nice introduction to coding for a living after changing careers. However, the company has been shaky from the beginning. The company relies on income from new sales and when they don’t make sales, pay gets delayed. It seems the CFO wasn’t managing the sales team correctly and they came and went. Checks started coming a few days late, then a few weeks, and then a few months. Last summer, the company hit its rockiest time yet and I didn’t get the two checks I was owed for August until the end of November. During that time, I nearly lost my mind because I was looking at it like I was working for free and struggled to maintain focus on my job. Everyone started working from home, most of my co-workers are older and know the bosses from previous jobs. I guess they have plenty of savings or back-up from their spouses because they never complained out loud like I did when the pay was delayed. Every time pay was delayed, management was terrible about communicating about when checks would come out. The CEO is a seemingly good guy but his update emails would be 3-5 paragraphs talking about what’s going on with the company but nothing about us getting paid so the employees had to contact him directly to ask about checks. It’s a small company so my pay isn’t great and I have debt so every time this happened, it really hurt. It always seemed to happen after I purchased a plane ticket when I was already spread thin. However, I took it as growing pains for a small company. I believed in what they offered and believed it would pay off in the end. I’ve always felt like a cog in the wheel at every job I’ve had before but felt like I was a part of something at this job. I like my co-workers and bosses, despite their lack of direction. At the end of last year, I decided to give them until this May to turn things around. I have options in the company and they’re supposed to vest at the end of April so I wanted to stick around to hopefully cash out down the road.

But this leads to now. Before the virus hit, the company hit another rocky patch and checks were delayed yet again. When the virus spread further, I had a feeling things would be ending for the company and sure enough, I was furloughed on Monday along with my co-workers. Some of the support team are still working for them for options down the road to keep the company afloat. All recent emails during the virus have been saying that there’s a possibility of money coming down the line when the virus clears up and they’re hoping it’s going to be May. However, as of Monday, they still owe me 3 paychecks. I told a friend of mine about it and he smells bullshit and  thinks I should report them to the state labor board. I sincerely doubt that the company has any money to pay me anyway and I’m not sure if reporting them will sink the company which I don’t really want to do. I’ve only been in contact with one other co-worker so I don’t know what the rest of them are doing. 

I filed for unemployment after being furloughed and have another job lined up when the virus goes away so hopefully things will get right soon but I’m not sure what to do in this situation and could use some advice.",7,1585171617,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foym7h/furloughed_by_company_that_still_owes_me_3/,personalfinance,1
foyl50,swp1105,Retirement funds to Money Market Funds was an option?,"Hi everyone. I just wanted to discuss and get some more clarification on this topic. In the past year or so, I've been hearing about the chance of a coming recession. Obviously no one could have predicted COVID-19, but it seems like we are now entering a recession. With this fear of a recession, I thought about trying to withdraw my retirement fund. I did not, because I am still very young (29) and knew it would be unwise to do so with the penalties and tax incurred. But it was still on my mind. 

Now with all that's happened, I researched potential options a bit more. I want to first say, I'm not going to do any of this now. It's too late and my retirement fund is for the long haul. BUT, am I correct in saying that I could have moved my retirement fund to a money market fund in say, January, and kept all the returns from my investment, without suffering any penalties or tax because I'm not actually withdrawing the money? Was anyone here able to do this?

I'm guessing if I asked about this 3-6 months ago I would be told it was a risk to lose any additional gains the stock market would make if I had my money sit in a money market fund. Obviously this is hindsight bias, but considering I was thinking about this option, I'm disappointed I didn't look further into this. Are there any other downsides to this I'm missing? For whatever reason I had no idea this could be an option. 

Again, NOT going to do any of this since it's far too late, but I just wanted to learn more about this and options for scenarios like this in the future.

foyl09,acbeeler131,Question about self employment vs employer tax rates for my situation,"Hey all,

Basically, my employer would like to switch me from a payroll employee to an independent contractor. It’s a pretty small, short term gig. Full time since January, will keep working with them till May. He basically told me to make sure I’m still going to be solvent and hit him with a number. He’s a good guy. 

My question is if I’m  switching from a W2 to a 1099 I’ll have a different tax rate, right? From what I’ve been able to gather a 1099 means ill be required to pay 15.3% more in taxes at the end of the year, rather than 7.65% being withheld and paid back to me (always got a full reimbursement due to my tax bracket). This means in order to make the same amount I’m currently making ($15/hr) I’ll need to get paid 1.153% ($17.30/hr)? Are there other fees or taxes I need to factor into this? And am I understanding this correctly so I know what the hell im talking about when I talk to my boss haha?

foyhwx,mckennamariee,21 y/o with IRA,"Hello everyone. I started a Roth IRA last year and have put in $12,000. I don’t know much about stocks or anything but I knew I wanted to start a retirement account and put my money somewhere I thought would be safe. (Again, I don’t know much about stocks so I realize it wasn’t safe to put it in there.) Before corona, I had earned $400-600 in the account. Now I have $9500 in my IRA. Most people tell me to keep my money in there. There’s no penalty if I take it out because it’s money that’s already been taxed and it’s all money that I’ve put in, not money earned at this point.

Others have told me I should take out my money while I can before it drops too low. 

Can someone please dummy down for me why it’s a good idea to leave my money in there when the balance is lowering every day?

foy5ot,new2telescopes,"Continue Plan or Adjust (401k, student loans, IRA, budget)","Basics about my financial situation:

I'm now 29 years old, graduated just shy of 5 years ago, and am now grossing about 120k each year and have been maxing out my 401k each year. This gives me a take home after taxes of about $5400/month. 

I pay \~$1500/month for my basic living expenses (home, water, electric, internet, etc); 

$865/month minimum student loan payment, 

$1650/month transferred to a savings account designated to pay off student loans

$500/month into a saving account to be transferred to an IRA.

$250/month saved for vacation

$100/month saved for gifts (birthdays/christmas)

$262/month saved for yearly expenses (insurance, license fees, etc)

&amp;#x200B;

This leaves me with $373/month left over which is used for food and entertainment.

I've been living like this for about 5 years now, adjusting up my student loan savings any time my income increases.

&amp;#x200B;

Current Savings:

&amp;#x200B;

34k in a savings account designated for student loans

6k in a savings account designated for 2019 Roth IRA

\~10k in an HSA (invested)

\~110k in my 401k (not invested)

\~20k in a Roth IRA (not invested.. using in place of emergency fund)

\~6k in my checking account

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my only debt is student loans at 46k.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the coronavirus situation, I planned to pay off my student loans in another two months (three paychecks) from now; put the 6k into the Roth IRA before April 15; and then put $2500/month into a savings account toward an emergency fund for the next 8 months until I have 20k in a real emergency fund. Then once I had the real emergency fund, I would invest the Roth.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this still a good plan, or should I adjust it given I'm currently relying on the Roth IRA as my emergency fund? I don't see my job being removed (healthcare essential worker) and my HSA has enough in it to reach my max out of pocket expense for the year if I do get the virus. If I did lose my job, my extra savings would stop and the Roth IRA emergency fund would last me for 9 months of expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I continue with this plan, wait to pay off the student loans until the end of the 6 month period congress is likely to pass, put the 6k designated for the Roth into my student loans and pay them off now, or are there any other changes I should make/options I should explore?

foxycc,redditredtop,"Just received four different mortgage loan options for me to review from a local business, is now the time to ""shop mortgages"" before choosing?","I've read and read and read, and I can't seem to come up with an answer. Perhaps I'm just nervous, but I'm not sure where to go from here? 

After months of preparing, I applied for a mortgage loan on Monday. I just got the results today and the lender gave me four different loan options. I am also on a callback list with my credit union to see what their options are but was told they are about 72 hours out (apparently they have been pretty busy). The current lender has a nice breakdown of every cost, and he has really done a lot to help me over the last few months (which I think has a value). 

Here's the meat and potatoes of the loans offered: 

|Loan Amount|Interest/APR|Down Payment|Closing Costs|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$126,100|4.375%/5.229%|$3,900|$7,338|
|$132,555|3.5%/4.834%|$4,725|$7,472|
|$152,193|4.5%/5.748%|$5,425|$5,502|
|$150,350|3.5%/4.342|$4,650|$5,460|

Do these options seem pretty standard? There's a post in here about the breakdown of closing costs and everything on the breakdown of my four options seems pretty much on par with that post. 

From what I understand from r/personalfinance is that I can apply for a mortgage loan with multiple lenders within a certain window and it will only be counted as once as far as credit goes. If that is correct, is now the time to ""shop mortgages"" before committing to this lender?

foxxor,reth1nk,"""Gifted"" down deposit","So I've been slowly over time putting my money into crypto since I personally believe it's a better investment over the next 5-10 years then most regular stocks as far as ROI.

&amp;#x200B;

I just started the process of looking to purchase my first home in Seattle. I was told I cannot use my crypto as part of the down deposit, even if I liquidated it. I'd have to liquidate and then leave it in my account to let it season for 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is about friends and family ""gifting"" down deposit funds. Can my friends / family gift me money signing a letter saying they never expect me to repay them, but I have no problem giving them the money from me liquidating my crypto assets when I do? I don't have to because they are signing a letter saying I don't have to but I just feel like when the time is right, why wouldn't I?

&amp;#x200B;

I know people are going around some of these barriers in getting gifted money up to 15K to avoid the gift tax. What is some advice if I can't wait the 2 months to let my money season in my bank account?

&amp;#x200B;

Side question: My girlfriend was going to pay me rent every month when I ended up purchasing. Can she gift me 15K upfront without the need of being repayed and have that considered as being a ""gift"". Technically I'm never paying her back for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been disabled since December 17, 2018.  My last day of work was December 13, but I must have had some PTO,because I still got a W2 for like, 30 bucks or something. I remained on their books as an employee on an unpaid leave of absence until this January, 2020.

As stoked as I was, as soon as the new card popped up on my Experian account, my scored dropped to 728.

I reached out to the plan administrator today and received this message back:

""To qualify for a 401K distribution and/or rollover, you must  
attain the age of 59 1/2 or after 12 consecutive months with  
no contributions made to the Plan. At this time you do  
not qualify. If additional contributions are not received,  
you would be eligible for a distribution/rollover as of  
12/15/20. Please contact us on or after 10/1/20 to request  
an application.""

Is this generally how 401k's are handled when you request a rollover? Technically, I am not employed right now by any of the companies involved in contributing. However, since I mainly work on a per-job contract basis, I could potentially work for one of the 401k matching employers in the future - however unlikely it may be now due to COVID19.

Like many people are likely facing, I got word today that my company (a small marketing agency with less than 20 employees) is laying off two of its employees and the rest of us are taking pay cuts. While it sounds like that will give us a bit of breathing room, I want to make sure I'm doing what I can now to financially prepare myself for being laid off or if the company goes under. 

My current situation:

Age: 29

Salary: $61,000, down from $65,000

Savings: ~$13,000 in a high-interest savings account and ~$200 in an Acorns account that I contribute $10/week too (obviously this took a huge hit over the past few weeks). I generally put $800-$1000 per month in savings at my $65,000 salary

Credit card: $2,300 balance on a card with 0% APR from Lasik surgery (was planning on paying this off in monthly installments before the 0% interest period finishes up in 14 months)

Retirement: ~$6,000 - I contribute 7% monthly but my company doesn't match

Monthly expenses: Average around $2400/month, including 'fun' spending. Necessary expenses are around $1400/month, but this could be decreased with tweaks to insurance, cell phone, and grocery.

Questions:

Is there anything I can do right now to set myself up for success (terrible word here, but you know what I mean!) in the chance that I do get laid off? 

Should I be preemptively tweaking any of my spending or saving habits - for example, reduce retirement contributions for now or pay off the credit card in full now?

Any advice on prepping to get a new job in case of a major recession? I know marketing's not a high demand field during these times so open to any advice on other avenues to explore here.

She reported fraud and the bank told her to put a hold on her account and make a new account. She did this and the withdrawal was rejected. But now the bank refuses to remove the hold on her old account unless she comes in person. They also refuse to transfer the money to her new account because its on hold (this is after they told her to specifically put it on hold and make a new account).

My mother can't come in person because of 1) she has no money to pay for a ticket because its all in her frozen account, 2) any second there's gonna be a travel ban here, and 3) and and more seriously, coronavirus issues. We've called customer service a million times but they keep telling her she has to come in person. My mother literally has no money and she can't even pay off her credit cards and the bank is even charging her to stop the fraudulent transaction (which is absolutely ridiculous) Does anybody know of a way to help resolve this situation?",5,1585165706,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fowu1a/is_there_anyway_to_remove_a_hold_on_a_bank/,personalfinance,1

fowfob,trylikeafool,Need some help deciding whether to stay or go...,"I could use some objective advice on what to do in my current situation. Like everyone else, I've been impacted by the shut downs, but I was laid off at the end of February due to the company being on the verge of bankruptcy (poor management). My job was the tech guru for this business - setting up their online store, setting up a video streaming service, graphic design, setting up a customer service portal, editing and uploading videos...anything tech related. However, I don't have programming experience. All of this was done with pre-built platforms that I implemented for the company. 

A little over six years ago, I moved to CA because my degree is in film, and I had Hollywood aspirations. I'd already interned at a studio as a student, and was able to get some production work after moving out. But it was hard to sustain, and I've been walking dogs, freelancing the tech stuff, and writing movie reviews to make money. Slowly over the past year or so, most of that work has dried up, and I'm not really making money right now. Maybe $50-100/week. After losing my job in February, I'd planned to hit the ground running in Hollywood again to try and get back to my original purpose for moving to CA. Had some meetings and an interview, but didn't get the job. Then the virus hit and the industry is basically shut down. The studio execs I talked to don't expect things to ramp up again until possibly fall, and my chances of getting hired over the people who were laid off is extremely slim.

So I think I have to move to plan B for now. My lease is up on May 17. I have no job, and my parents have offered to let me move back to TN and stay with them. I could try to get another job here in CA, but with so much uncertainty and companies laying people off, I don't know if it's smart to even try to stay in CA right now. I'm also about $35,000 in debt - medical and credit cards. A few months ago my credit score was 710, and now it's below 600. I had to miss a couple of credit card payments because I didn't have the money to pay, and the CC company wouldn't work with me until I was behind on payments...so they got to screw me. 

Should I throw in the towel on CA and move back with my folks? The Memphis job market isn't as good as it is in CA, and there are more opportunities in CA. I don't really want to live in Memphis, but my entire family is in TN, and I would have their support while everything's crazy. The lower cost of living might give me a chance to pay down some of this debt, which I wasn't making any headway on in CA. It just sucks walking away from what I thought my life was going to be, and now having to change course. I'm thinking about learning web development, or finding a job that will let me use my writing background. Working for $15/hour at Amazon or Whole Foods right now isn't going to cut it. I'm 39, and I need to be making some respectable money.",4,1585164387,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fowfob/need_some_help_deciding_whether_to_stay_or_go/,personalfinance,1

fovp3l,Chonch1224,"If you use Chase (or 3rd party travel vendor) please follow up on the individual policy's yourself, don't always take the 3rd party's word on refunds","TL;DR - follow up on hotel &amp; airline policy's if you book through 3rd party to see if you are eligible for refunds. Do not always take the 3rd party word for it, especially if it is an online application

Chase Ultimate Rewards is seeing a serious amount of volume with COVID-19 affecting so many countries around the world. There are a ton of new policy's being put in place and refunds offered that were not offered in the past.

I give the team there a lot of credit, if you actually get through they are doing a great job to make sure you are properly refunded if the policy is in place. They recently created an ""online form"" so they can review it at a later time and try and cut down on some of the call volume.

I was able to talk to someone and get refunds on 75% of my travel (prior to the form being available), the other 25% I was waiting and filled out the online forms, there were 3 total. Both of my flights were canceled (spoke with BA directly and was told I was eligible for a full refund but had to go through chase) and Air France has a policy on their site (can rebook or get a refund if they cancel). The 3rd one I filled out a form for was for a hotel in Paris. This hotel decided to close from March 17th - April 15th, published on SM and their website. My stay was March 19th-21st.

All 3 seemed like very reasonable easy refunds. I waited the 10 days and received 2 emails. The first was a travel voucher (good until October 2020) for about 40% of my flight since they thought I took one of the legs. The second was saying I did not qualify for a refund from the hotel based on their most recent policy.

If I did not do any digging myself I would be out quite a bit of money. I called in and spoke with a Chase Representative who was able to get the flight sorted out, but cannot refund my hotel until they speak with a hotel supervisor. This was odd since they agreed and confirmed the hotel was closed for my stay. The 3rd (Air France) was also still pending.

fovoe1,kre8tv,Should I forego a week of pay at my current job?,"First time posting, sorry if I mess it up.

Background - I'm an area manager for a chain of retail adult stores.  Our CEO is not hopeful we'll get approved for government aid loans because of our industry.

All of our store staff has been laid off except corporate management.

She gave us the option today to either forego a week of pay for the next pay cycle (and she may ask again if this continues on, which it probably will) or go on unemployment.

I've never been on unemployment before and am not entirely sure how it works.  If I give up a week of pay now, will that affect how much I can claim if I have to go on unemployment later?  Is there more benefit for me to do one or the other?

I'm certain I'll still have a job to go back to with either choice, just not sure if one would be better for me or not.

Rent is about 1600 I believe. This is the Bay area btw so this rent is a gem also we've been here for way too long.

Taking out equity to pay student loans
Is it a good idea to take out home equity to pay student loans? I have a mortgage balance of 230 at an interest rate of 3.7%. Value of the home is ~450K. It's a 30 year loan with 25 years left. I have a student loan of 200K at 6.8%. This is down from 300 K with aggressive payments. I am in the medical field and will be going back to training again for minimum of 2 years. During that time, I'll be making 3.5-4k a month. It will be enough to pay mortgage, utilities and some towards loan payment, likely just interest on the loan but not much more. My plan was to take out at least 70 K in equity and pay towards the student loan to decrease the balance significantly where I could afford to make payments with my new income. With the mortgage refinance, I'm hoping to get a 3-3.5% interest rate on a 20 year loan (this would be 5 year shorter than the term I have now). My mortgage payment will go up but the loan term is reduced. I am still not sure if it's a good idea to pay one debt with another one . Please advise me.

Since I haven't worked in the states the past two years, would I even qualify? If I do, how should I go about this? Embarrassed to ask but I don't have that much experience with taxes in general.

fouwyf,lewpiper,Home buying appraisal and options,"My fiancé and I are in the process of buying our first home. Next week we are going in to sign the contract, and the following week we are going to pick our options.

For a little background we are buying a $408,000 house in California and plan on spending about $38,500 in options without solar and about $50,000 if we do solar. We know we could probably save another $5,000-$10,000 between now and the time we would close, just in case we were upside down, but I am curious what other people commonly spend in upgrades/options. Is 9%-12% of the purchase price of the house crazy high or should I not worry?",4,1585159305,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fouwyf/home_buying_appraisal_and_options/,personalfinance,1

fouvp2,giveandtake02,My plan to not be homeless after high school.,"Context: I turned 18 earlier this year and was told by my single parent that they're moving out of the country permanently in the summer, and that I'm on my own to figure out what to do. I've already graduated high school, have all my important documents, and have a personal bank account and credit card.

My original plan was to rent a room way out of the city (Los Angeles where I currently live) with my savings and look for any stable job while I figure out what the heck to do. Unfortunately as time moved on with everything happening right now, that might not be able to work out. So now I've gone and thought of a completely different path.

1.) Already applied for a community college out-of-state in Oregon, where they have tuition reciprocity (California residents are able to pay in-state cost) and the cost of living is lower than here in the middle of LA.

2.) Filled out FAFSA as dependent (next year I'll be considered independent clearly), received a full Pell Grant and plan on borrowing out the full subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans to pay for my rent, food, all other necessities.

3.) Attend college, keep enrollment at full-time while finding a job and working as many hours as possible. Live super frugally, going to school's food pantry + food banks in the city.

4.) Get a Certified Nursing Assistant licence through the college, increase my income and keep building a sizeable emergency fund.

5.) Haven't planned this far out ahead but yeah, please help if you see any way this can work better. Thank you.",84,1585159194,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fouvp2/my_plan_to_not_be_homeless_after_high_school/,personalfinance,1

fousiq,Cymrik_,Financial Fork in the Road,"Hi Everyone. I have a question about some financial choices that I feel are coming my way. I received an inheritance of what I consider to be a decent amount in 2016. It is managed by a Wells-Fargo accredited fiduciary financial planner. The account has various different funds with different percentages, from 1-2% of the principal as the management fee. I know that this is high and I'm looking at what to do now to maximize the money that I retire with. I'm 32 and make about 40k a year in the midwest where that is the average income. I plan on working til I'm about 55 and then retiring. I currently have (after this shitty drop in the market) 570k in the retirement account. It was at about 670k in February :/

What do you guys think I should do? I know that Vanguard is highly touted. Currently, there are several different diversified mutual funds and other things like that. I was considering consulting a fee-only adviser to get me on track, but I'm up to listening to advice from here. I know that I will probably need assistance consolidating and moving this money without taking a hit on taxes/fees/other things. I know there are ways around it. I also spoke to my adviser and she's getting all the fees to be 1% because I mentioned Vanguard, so I think she wants to keep my business.

I can afford to keep this money under wraps for another 20 years and I want to retire with a couple of million dollars so I can do whatever the fuck I want with my retirement pension.

fouplq,supernutcondombust,How do you budget around getting paid on different days every month?,"I was getting paid every two weeks, first and fifteenth. Now I get paid every four weeks since company was bought. It's such a bizarre concept to me to get paid different days every month because bills don't work like that. Bills are due when they are due and if I only have half pay at that point I'm kind of screwed.

This month is a good example. A lot of my stuff is due on the 17th to 19th. Which was fine when I got paid on the 15th. My mortgage is due on the first, so I took the first paycheck and paid mortgage and used what was left for one bill and groceries / gas. Then the second check was the rest of my bills. Perfect system for me.

Well this month was rough because the 17-19th was in the middle of the week and I get paid every Friday. So I wasn't going to have bill money until 2-3 days late. And what is super super hard right now is - I don't know what my checks will look like. My first check they deducted EVERYTHING from. Taxes, benefits, etc. So it was just under $600. Which was a huge difference to the $1460 I was used too. I'll get the rest Friday, but still - having to budget around that was hard.

I already had one bill moved to the 28th of every month and I called the mortgage bank and asked for an extension. My grace period ends on the 17th but what I want to do is basically just hold on to all of my pay through April so I know what my checks will be. Then pay everything in an order that will help me create a pattern I can follow. The mortgage bank said since I have 100% on time - I get a one time exemption. If I pay after the 17th this once and call - they will waive the penalty and it won't hurt my credit. So I'll prob do that.

But how the hell do I budget around this? I will be basically check to check for 2020 and then I can save again, but getting that first reduced check and then it be like the 3rd or 6th instead of the first will be hard.

How do you balance getting paid literally different dates every month? Why do places even do this to people?",22,1585158616,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fouplq/how_do_you_budget_around_getting_paid_on/,personalfinance,1

fouhep,wingerd33,I'm considering taking over a lease on a vehicle. What are the things I should look out for?,"Well, I wouldn't say I'm ""considering"" it quite yet. But there's one that I'm entertaining. Also, if there's a better place to ask about this, please let me know. I plan to crosspost it to r/askcarsales as well for the added perspective.

Some details:

It's a 2019, 36 month/36k mile lease. It was a demo/shuttle vehicle used by the dealership. The original lessee got it with 6k miles already on it. The monthly payment reflects that and it seems to be a good deal. I would be taking over the remaining payments, so no ""down payment"" of any kind.

He's had it for 7 months and put around 5k miles on it, so all good on the mileage so far. I would assume the remaining 29 months and have ~31k miles which is plenty for me as it won't be my only vehicle.

He purchased gap insurance with the lease and he thinks that will transfer to me as well. I want to research that some more (or maybe you all know more about it) - first, is it even useful on a lease; second, does it indeed transfer; and third, does it cover damage or mileage overages in any capacity?

I'm wondering if there are any red flags to look out for, or if it's generally a bad idea to assume a lease, etc. I've never done a lease before to begin with, but I've weighed the pros and cons and think it would be okay for me for my current need/want.

What can we do?,"We just got a statement from our mortgage company stating that we owe $4388 as an escrow shortage and they are threatening to raise our payments by $365 a month to cover the shortage. When I run the math this seems like a massive mistake as we just changed home insurers reducing our yearly costs (although taxes did go up about 200 a year). Looking at the statement provided it looks like they massively underestimated the costs of our last insurance payment by almost 3x the amount considering that hasnt changed in prior years. So now we are being told to make up for their accounting mistake even though it would result in a refund next year. Current year expenses $4267 compared to $6119 from last year.

Statement Here for reference: [Statement](https://imgur.com/a/7cZVZqe)

This mortgage company every year has been either short or surplus and it is getting ridiculous. I have already filed a CFPB complaint against them for their consistently incorrect accounting for something that is just 3 payments a year.

fotwtu,che_la_74,Mr.Bezos is being bad. He was asked to setup a fund to support employees. Now he’s asking for DONATIONS to fund it.,"I find it rather offensive. I went to chat with them and demanded (+received) a partial refund on my membership as the company can’t deliver on its promises. You should too.

Just go to contact us and open chat window. Then tell them that due to inability of the company to deliver on the promise of fast shipping you ask for a partial refund of your prime membership. Say that primarily you have it to enjoy two day delivery and since now every other order is up to a month away you want a partial refund... They will give it to you. They might negotiate on how much but they will. 

I got refunded and put that amount to the employees fund. Since Mr.Bezos doesn’t wanna help his people I think we should take the money out of his company and give it to them anyways...

I read many of the most popular threads on this topic but they were mostly dated about a year ago. Financial technology and the financial services industry is moving faster these days so wanted to get a quick gauge from you experts on the best platforms.

I just moved to the US 2 months ago and need to begin building my investments. What are the best platforms / banks to go through? I've heard Ameritrade is good now given commission-free. Perhaps it may be helpful to categorize - which is best for:

1) equities

2) index funds / mutual funds

3) robo-advisors

4) options

The best option may overlap for some of these.

So this guy messages me on Instagram (I am a music producer) saying he knows someone who is willing to buy my music and initially he was going to pay $2k for my beats so I sent the middle man about $900 cause he said he doesn't want to get lowballed. As time goes on the buyer says he wants to buy the beats for $5k so he can get more beats. He says he was waiting for his tax check and that's why he took so long so I sent him more. Then apparently the middle man lost his phone so I couldn't contact the guy for weeks and he never answers his phone. Only when he wants me to send (which I keep saying no so many times). 

Now present day, The buyer says he's going to buy the beats for $7600 for 13 beats. Says he's working on the album and needs the beats asap. He wants me to send my bank account number and routing number as well (which I said no, I'm not gonna give out that info to someone idk). I told him to pay me in paypal, cashapp and venmo and he says it doesn't work. I don't buy that AT ALL, there's absolutely no way it should not work. Its been a couple of days now and still hasn't bought it yet and I'm getting anxious and really worried.

So now, what should I do about this situation? I contacted the police and they said they can't do anything about it. I made the claim on my bank about it and can't do anything about it either. I want revenge on this guy so how can I do it? I have his name, phone number email, and I know he lives somewhere in Atlanta, Georgia. Please help, thanks.

TL;DR: Sent middle man some money so the buyer can buy 13 beats for $7600, buyer makes bunch of excuses and felt like I got scammed hard. Want revenge.",21,1585155191,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fotots/i_got_scammed_almost_5k_what_can_i_do_to_get_this/,personalfinance,1

I was in a pinch at the time, the car I had was financially upside down also a total loss and no gap insurance coverage. All that said rebates on my truck covered 98% of the negative equity. Pair that with my down payment at the time and I came out about $2000 under sticker except the note was 84 months (I know I know). My credit at the time was 150 points lower than it is now and with current interest rate offerings I could theoretically reduce my interest by 1.5-3% and reduce the length of the loan by 3 years. Currently I’m paying more than the monthly required amount but at my current pace would only reduce my loan my 6 months. I have a healthy savings and refinancing would increase the (required) monthly payment $300, and about $150 over what I currently pay. If my math is correct, my payment would increase but my savings in interest alone would be over $7000. Can anyone tell me what I might be overlooking? Good idea? Bad idea? Thoughts?

The coronavirus effect hit me like a ton of bricks last night. I was doing well mentally and physically, but something happened where I sat with the reality last night of what's happening to me, to others, to the world, and I shook in fear.

I am officially at the end of my financial rope. I am an artist and consultant, and my freelance jobs and the PT job I had have evaporated -- along with the income I have -- and my savings are next to nothing. I am actually quite the saver, but 2020 did not start well as I lost a high-paying client and scrambled to find additional work. Eventually, I found the aforementioned two gigs which were great, but lost them both as of March 15, thanks to COVID-19.

I am rather terrified even though I wasn't before, and for the first time as an adult, I don't have enough money to pay rent, and have to tell my landlord but am worried sick. While there is a suspension on mortgage payments, there is still no suspension for rent payments.

My accounts are as follows:

Personal checking: $248.34

Biz savings (for taxes): $421.48

Personal savings: $252.19

Personal credit card:  $5,287.98 (now being used for groceries, utility bills, etc.)

Any advice, words of wisdom, consolation, or anything helps at this time. 

Do I move back to my hometown (300+ miles away) to be with my folks? I live in the epicenter of the outbreak, and think this will be a massive threat to my parents -- both over 65 and one with a heart condition.

fosuct,halfbackrambo,Letter of rent being paid by spouse for mortgage loan,"Hi PF,

I will preface this by saying we're not here to have people say don't cosign cause I know how this sub gets with this. It's a done deal already and we have our reasons. Anyway. My spouse is currently in the process of cosigning a house with his father and said they need a letter stating that I pay for 100% of rent for our current apartment, which is true since I make more. He pays the rest of the shared bills and for food. My spouse will not be living in the house and is just cosigning for his parents. It's imperative they get this letter or their loan will not be approved. Initially they said that a typed and notarized letter from me would be sufficient but now they say the underwriters need a letter from the apartment managers.

Does anyone have experience with this? I have tried contacting the apartments and they have no clue what I am talking about. Any other to get around this to have their loans approved? 

Thanks for your help in advance.",4,1585152356,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fosuct/letter_of_rent_being_paid_by_spouse_for_mortgage/,personalfinance,1

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds like it's the whole package, you can get through all nine lessons plus  the two bonus courses of four lessons each in the 14 day period and pay nothing. You also get access to ask-a-coach, and the FPU forums. Just make sure to cancel before the 14 days are up! (Assuming you have to put  in a debit card then cancel manually like other trials - I already have  a membership so I didn't test this.)

&amp;#x200B;

There's  a couple other things on deep discounts also, TMM audiobook is $2 as well as the Proximity Principle. The high school program is $20, rather than $120 so if you have a student home check that out.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there's a love/hate relationship here with Dave, but this is a great starting point for many people trying to improve their financial situation long-term and trying it for free is a great opportunity.

I've worked for a company (1,400 employees) as a Team Lead for 6 years in an industry that is undergoing a lot of consolidation. As a team lead, I made around $45k.

Last year, I was promoted to Director of our finance department and make around $70k.

This year, I've been offered a promotion under the condition I move to another state (from a top 20 metropolitan area to a top 10 metropolitan area) to be at that company's main headquarters. They've offered $80k with no title name change at this time, but indicated they have big plans down the road and they want me to be a part of it (they could not elaborate on what those plans are).

This company has expressed how much they want to keep me, so I know I'm in a good position to negotiate. I have a bachelor's degree, but not in finance. 

My questions are:

1. Is it reasonable to ask for higher salary, given my title name isn't changing (I want $100k at least)?
2. If I ask for a higher salary and the company asks 'why should we give you that much,' what are some good talking points to bring up? I already know they want me, but what are good talking points to quantify my value?
3. How could I leverage their unspecified future plans in my negotiation with them now?
4. I know there are plans to consolidate the company even further. Can I use this to my advantage?

The man on the phone identified himself as a member of Chase's fraud prevention team. I wasn't asked to identify myself, other than confirming my name. We discussed my recent charges, and I told him anything coming from Atlanta and not Texas is fraudulent. He determined that the charge was fraudulent (no shit) and told me we'd need to burn this card and issue a new one. He confirmed my address. I didn't have to provide it.

After saying he would expedite my card to the address on file, he said it looks like the breach was through my online banking and that they would need to burn my username and reissue a new user profile. He asked for my ""old username"". I saw this as a red flag, but provided it. He then asked for my ""old password"" and I told him ""I've been using my fingerprint to log in for so long that I couldn't tell you my password even if I wanted to, which I don't, fucker."" and hung up.

I called Chase's fraud line myself, but the wait was incredibly long so I went to my local branch and bro'd out with my banker and had a laugh about all this. He confirmed that it was all a sham andI was issued a new card and user profile.

I Wont be eligible for my current employer's health insurance plan for 90 days, Over the weekend my former employer sent me documents in the mail to enroll in Cobra but this will Cost me 1,000  a month to maintain my health insurance.    


My New jobs Salary is 60,000 a year. I have not received my first Paycheck yet because I only worked 3 days so far and after my third day I developed a fever and my employer told me to stay at home for the rest of this week. Because of this I cant accurately say what would be financially feasible for myself. I have until March 31st until I lose my health insurance. With this huge health Crisis going on right now Health insurance is more important than ever. I am a 25 year old male who is for the most part healthy with no preexisting conditions. I went to my State's Marketplace website for health insurance policies. the cheapest is 190$ but it basically offers very minimal service.  Another plan I was looking at was at $600 with a relatively low Deductible. Or I can completely forgo this for 90 days.   


This is still a tough decision to make without me fully knowing what my consistent paycheck will be.  My gut is telling me to wait for my first Paycheck (lose out on the cobra plan) and use that information to purchase a plan on the marketplace. The 600 dollar plan does seem like a decent band-aid until I get my new Employer coverage. Any advice  is greatly appreciated. This is a scary time to be in.

fos7dh,DanioMasher,Sending money to a stranger in another country over the internet through Xoom,"I know what you're thinking, right? I'm thinking the same thing. The words that come to mind are stupid, ridiculous, insane, never, etc. But the more I think about it, the more I realize I don't really know the answer. What are the risks of sending a stranger money in another country through remittance apps such as Xoom or Worldremit?

Obviously you lose the money that you sent, but what if you wanted that money to be sent? Are there more risks?

Here's the full story. I was home quarantined, and a little bored, so I did something I never do, accept a DM on Instagram from a random person. Almost immediately, he starts telling me about his sob story. I'm fully aware that this is a major red flag, literally every one of these remittance apps talks about this situation. He's from the Gambia, where the price of rice has shot up due to Corona virus panic, and he can no longer work collecting firewood. His parents died recently and he has a younger sister to take care of. He asked if I could spare $70 for 50kg of rice and vegetables that would last him and his sister a month while they stay indoors. I said there was no way, I can't spare $70, and he said any small amount helps because they have literally no food right now and are starving. He's been constantly pestering me ever since, even going so far as reposting a pic of my own food I posted, saying something like ""I wish everyone could have good food like this"". 

I did some research, and the Gambia is in a state of emergency over Corona virus, and the price of rice this guy gave me makes sense, so his story is at least plausible. He sent me pics with the date handwritten to show he was the same dude and not just a generic scam account. I'm sick of this guy pestering me and plan to block him, but I also really feel bad about his situation because I don't doubt at least a lot of the major parts of it. Would it be absolutely crazy to send this stranger $5-10 through Xoom before blocking him? I really don't care about the $5-10 if it helps two people stave off starvation for a week during a global pandemic. But I'm worried about things like identity theft, losing more than $5-10, etc. Is this a real concern though? He already knows my full name, unfortunately. I never realized this was displayed on Instagram until now (will definitely change that). But what else could he possibly learn or gain from such a transaction, besides that I'm a sucker for a good sob story?",18,1585150125,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fos7dh/sending_money_to_a_stranger_in_another_country/,personalfinance,1

fos04g,TheGreatHambino52,"Do I invest, continue to save, or pay off credit card debt?","I am looking for some insight and opinions on what to do with my money.  I dont have a lot but I was considering getting into investing but had some questions.

I am self admittedly pretty ignorant about investing and most financial decisions in general.  I am in my early 30's and feel like a fool for just now trying to educate myself to put my family in the best position possible.

My wife and I got married young and always had the same goals in mind when it came to marriage, kids, family etc... We were young, in love, and prioritized starting a family.  We are the same age and had 3 kids by the time we were 30 - We wanted to be young parents.  Some people like to wait to be financially secure but we had the opposite feeling.  We wanted to be able to physically give our all to our children and have the energy and time to fully committ to anything they wanted to do in life and we felt the longer we waited, the harder that would become.  We never really had extra money to save or invest because we were young parents with mouths to feed.  

We still dont have a lot, but I have a little bit and I want to make what little I have work for me but as I said I am a virgin when it comes to this stuff.

Here is my current situation:

- As I mentioned we are in our early 30's 

- 401K before COVID-19 was around 65K...now currently sitting around 48K

- I have a 529 college fund I started the day after my first child was born.  Before COVID-19 was around 10K in that...now sitting around 7K

- About 12K in a savings account

- About 10K in credit card debt.

- Other than a mortgage and one car payment, we have no other debt.  (Just recently finished paying off college loans for both of us...woohoo!)

I was seriously considering starting to invest but I am not sure if that is the right decision at this time.

- Should I use a couple thousand from savings to start investing, keep a couple thousand in savings for emergency and continue paying credit card
minimums?

- Should I use pretty much all of my savings to pay off the credit cards and barely have anythinf left for emergencies?

- Should I continue what I am currently doing ?  Which is paying the minimums on credit cards, continue to save a little bit until I have more money saved to invest?

- I know you cant use the same 529 for two kids in college at the same time and our kids are close in age so I know I probably need to open another 529.  Should I prioritize that over investing?

I just worry that I am not on the right track in life for someone my age.

forzj3,opulentbum,Can anyone offer some tips to creating a budget? Considering purchasing a home.,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text, as well as the probably scattered thought process. Any help, tips, insights or feedback would be much appreciated. I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.

 I have next to 0 experience when it comes to fending for myself/adulting. I am 24, currently living at home with my parents rent free (big thanks to them for that). This has enabled me to save heavily over the last few years though. I currently have \~$27,000 put away. I have been looking around the housing market and am planning to purchase a condo. I am lucky, my parents are offering to assist me with a downpayment to get me up to the 20% mark so I do not blow my entire savings and it will help lower my mortgage payments a bit. Cannot express how grateful I am for that help. I am already pre-qualified for up to 187k, but I know that ultimately I wouldn't be able to afford that much because I am only making roughly $40,000 right now gross income for the year. I am looking in the 150-170k range which would leave me with a mortgage somewhere between 1,230 and 1,330 per month roughly. This includes taxes for my area, insurance, estimated HOA fees and based off the 20% downpayment. Most places I am looking at in that price range include a second bedroom so if things got rough I would be able to rent that second room to help cover some of the costs, but would prefer to do this on my own if I can.

With all of that being said, I have no outstanding debt aside from the student loan payments that I make at $120 per month. My company offers a student loan relief program and will be making additional payments on that for me along the way. Car is paid off and only 6 years old, no CC debt because I pay the full balance monthly. When I go through the numbers every time for other expenses, like gas, food, electric, health insurance, 401(k) contributions (which I know is technically voluntary but I consider it important enough to deem essential) etc. it seems I would be able to afford it. But I just worry that I am leaving something out and would hate to find that out the hard way AFTER moving out on my own.

Now, both my wife and I are working from home and we have our kids with us at the house now.

A lot of answers have been to pay because we are holding the child’s place at the day care or we have signed a contract, etc etc
Since this is an at home day care, we never signed a contract, it was a cash payment (essentially under the table - now they are taking the course to become licensed but hit a snag because of COVID).

Financially, my wife and I are still both being paid so we are not being affected like others during this difficult time.

forx20,jedwinjim,Serving my notice when coronovirus hit,"Hi all, I was 1 week into serving my month's notice when coronavirus hit the UK. I was due to begin my new job on 10th April within the hospitality trade (restaurant café) . Obviously they're in no rush to take me on now, having sent me an email asking me to take the first 2 weeks as unpaid leave. Although financially I could bridge the gap for 2 weeks without pay, Mr primary concern is that as we get closer to this time there's more than likely going to be another email asking me to take another 2 weeks unpaid leave, as let's face it the hospitality sector isn't going to be up and running any time soon.

My question is... Can anyone provide clarity on financial support for those who's job moves have been jeopardised by coronavirus, and more specifically can I be furloughed with the government scheme of covering 80% of my wages? Or would I have to have been an employee with the company before the coronavirus hit?

foruht,pfnewjob,Starting a new job in New York - what can I do to be financially smart?,"Hi, all. Throwaway account for personal reasons. I am in New York City.

Prior to the NYC shutdown, I signed an offer letter with a new job to start on April 27th. At my current job, I am told I have to give 30 days of written notice. Obviously, with the current crisis, I feel like many things are up in the air. The HR department at my new job has assured me that I have signed the letter, and that this is a legal contract, and I will start my new job on April 27th. This new job is at a more stable institution. I am going from a private non-profit that is facing layoffs in the near future to an established and well-funded private university.

1) I believe that I do not legally have to give 30 days notice in New York State and can legally give two weeks notice. If I give only two weeks notice, can my current company refuse to pay out my vacation time?

2) Is there anything I can do with my new employer in order to be more secure before my start date? I asked to fill out hiring paperwork ahead of time, and the HR person said that I could, but has not been in touch with anymore information. I would like to follow up with them - what paperwork should I  be asking to fill out? The I9?

3) My current supervisor knows that I plan to leave, but that I am waiting to give my official notice to the organization. I was thinking I would give my official notice on April 1st as I am guessing that if more big changes happen, we will know about them by then. Does this sound like a good idea?

I do not have access to my contract with my current employer, other than my offer letter when I accepted the job. If my current employer were to fire me when I give notice, leaving me unemployed for one month, I would be fine financially. However, I do not have an emergency fund that will last beyond two months. (I am building my EF now, though, and have reliable support from my partner and my family, including emergency housing if needed.)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Regular (Standard Base Period) method: There must be wages in at  least two quarters in the base period. For benefit years beginning Jan.  1, 2020, one quarter's wages must be at least $3,744; and total wages  for all four quarters must equal at least one and a half times the  highest amount of wages paid in any quarter of the base period ($3,667 x  1.5 = $5,616).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  OR  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Alternate Earnings Qualifier (AEQ):  (a) You must have wages in at  least two quarters; and (b) total wages for all four quarters must equal  at least 20 times the state average weekly wage (SAWW). For 2020, the  AEQ amount is $20,742 \[20 x $1,037.10 (SAWW) = $20,742\].

Unfortunately, a friend of mine is just short of the $3,744 (\~$3,600) and does not meet the Alternate Earnings Qualifier (under $20,742).  They were going to meet the $3,744 this quarter, but the business has been shut down due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

I recently filed unemployment due to my work shutting down cause of COVID. The part where it asked me if I worked for a specific employer was confusing to me. One of the 2 employers was listed as their old company name. Meaning, the company changed their name, but it essentially the same company.

Like the dummy I am, I just said that I worked for the *current name* employer, and not both. 

I also listed a substitute teaching employer that I just now started working for, not back in 2019, so that was a mistake as well.

I filed a protest, stating all the facts above. I did not include my case number nor file number, as I was freaking out and didn’t think twice. I did include my full name though.

Does anyone know if this will work? I am currently getting $0 benefits, and in my letter, they said that the  “agency is investigating this discrepancy” because obviously the old name employer said I worked for them.

for0qe,nagualdonjuan,Airbnb refuses to give me a refund for my trip in April,"I am frustrated. 

I had a long trip planned in April to the US. I live in Dublin in Ireland, so this required a lot of planning in advance. As you are probably aware, European flights are banned to the US. 

Many airlines in spite of the loss have been great offering rescheduling and refunds, no questions asked. Even with the US and Europe restrictions, as well as cruises and airlines offering refunds and vouchers, I feel Airbnb is failing to be flexible enough and keep their customers secure during this global pandemic. They are only offering full refunds until the 14th of April. 

Everything I had planned got cancelled, except my Airbnb accommodation. I just haven't been able to cancel it. The host only offers 40% refund, she declined my request for a full refund and Airbnb customer service asked me to wait. Even if all restrictions get lifted in two weeks (which is highly unlikely), there is no reason for me to keep the booking anyway. 

This is a considerable amount of money, which adds to other concerns I prefer not getting into.

With all of the new car deals (0% APR over 60-84 months) going 0n with car dealerships being desperate to sell, is this enough incentive to buy new versus used?

My current car (2005 Lexus GX470) has some immediate repair needs($1k) and some future repairs (suspension) in its future. My car is at 175k miles right now. My wife wants me to consider buying a new car, but I want to drive my car into the ground! About us, we have:

\- 4 month emergency budget

\- Wife's job secure (covers monthly expenses). 

\- My job is less secure, but I am secure through at least May and my company is slashing travel expenses, bonuses, and leadership pay to not lay off anyone. Our company is doing the same right now, but can potentially lose 15-25% of our business by May and layoffs can begin in May, accordingly. In the event I lose my job, I'll receive 1 month of severance (1.5 months of emergency budget) and a lump sum pension that would be 2.5-3 months of emergency budget after tax or can be invested.

\- 401ks and HSAs are maxed out

\- No kids, 1 dog

\- We can lower our monthly expenses by 40% by moving out of our month to month rental and move in with my sister-in-law in her house

TL;DR — have a good emergency fund but still terrified of potential loss of wife’s job. Any way to help that?

My wife is a physical therapist and her company just started furloughing people yesterday ... not her yet but obviously it’s a possibility so we’re scared and trying to make plans. 

Currently in various savings accounts (emergency fund, vacation fund, etc — not including retirement, college savings, 401k) we have about a years worth of her take home pay. We get insurance through her job so obviously we would need to account for that if she loses her job. 

I am self-employed so my income varies — roughly 1/2 of hers on any given year. As of now I’m not really seeing a down turn in my business but it’s always variable and the main thing that keeps me from worrying too much about it is knowing we have my wife’s salary. 

In an average month of business for me I can cover our mortgage/insurance,car payment (only 3 months left), her student loan payment, cell phone, internet, car insurance, and life insurance payments. In a good month I could cover more than that. 

Typing all this out I know (intellectually) we’re in a good position in case something does happen ... but does that ever give anyone peace of mind? Or is the shock of loss of job / income always severe and scary no matter how well prepared you are? I just never planned for something like this and it’s blindsiding me.

My wife and i had contributed 6k  each to our Roth IRA accounts at Vanguard for 2019 - but we had to file Married File Separate due to high student loans and being under the PLSF plan. 

I called Vanguard and they let me know that I can do a backdoor ROTH IRA - but i had some money in a traditional rollover IRA account so i would be hit with the Pro-Data Rule. Luckily our 401k allowed me to move money from the traditional rollover IRA  to the 401k so the balance in the traditional rollover IRA is $0 and i am ready to transfer the money from my Roth IRA to the traditional IRA account at Vanguard. 

However, when I called Vanguard they said that right now I would be transferring at a loss since the market is down of course. I thought I might take my chances and wait a week or two to see if the market might go up - but the adviser said that it actually might be better for me to do this move from ROTH IRA to Traditional Rollover IRA and back into a ROTH IRA when it is at a loss.

I can't figure out which IRA format would be best for my situation. On one hand, I don't earn much so I'd think a traditional IRA would be best so that I can maximize  compound interest by investing my tax deductions back into the IRA. On the other hand, I could be in a higher tax bracket at retirement than I am now, in which case I would pay more taxes with a trad than a roth. How to know which is more: gains from from re-investing tax deductions into a trad, or gains from not losing on taxes at retirement? Are there formulas to compare?

Additional Info -

I'm 33 years old and just starting to get my finances in order. I only have about 2 grand to put in an IRA today. I currently earn 25 grand a year, but in 2 years when I graduate I will be in the 50-100 grand a year zone. I will graduate with 55 grand of school debt. This is a STEM grad degree btw, and debt is from undergrad (fed loans, half is subsidized, both are in deferment and I'm paying interest plus a little more). I'm expecting to retire around age 65.

foq4qn,Super-Tennis,Refinancing Mortgage and Divorce,"Hi all. Throwaway here (though I was surprised this cool name was available!).

My marriage has been on the rocks pretty much since it started three years ago. Never mean or bad and without many fights, but I have been unhappy within it for three years. Despite many attempts to work on our relationship, we are roommates and lack personal intimacy. I won't go into details because my question is not about marriage.

Two summers ago, we bought a house. It is my dream house. We just got an offer to refinance and the rate is pretty good for us (would save us $150 a month at least on mortgage and the refinancing fees are less than $2500). It seems like a good deal. However, as I was thinking about my relationship, I don't know that I can stay in it for years to come. We are working on things, but it feels like I am the only one doing the work, and I just don't know if I can even stay in this marriage for a year more.

However, I think if we were to split up, I would like to stay in our house (if that is possible). We both make the same amount of money annually and are doing pretty okay for young professionals. 

My question is, would it be stupid to refinance the house now? More broadly, how does a mortgage factor into divorce?

fopzh1,evansmatthew_au,Unsure of whether to file for unemployment,"Hey everyone, 

Maybe somebody can shed a little light on how to proceed with my current situation. Yesterday I received news that as of next Friday, I will be temporarily laid off from my full-time job until COVID-19 blows over. We've seen some major downsizing with our company, as one might imagine is happening basically everywhere. My salary there is $45k/year. 

That said, I also work a part-time job making $15/hour. I only work one day per week, but they've offered to give me full time hours until I can go back to work full-time. It's possible I'll get a small raise when I go back as well, but it's unclear as of now. 

My question is, can I even still file for any type of unemployment since I have the option to work full-time? On unemployment, I am calculating I will get $467/week ($387 after I squirrel a % away for taxes..). 

Working full-time at this job, I'd make anywhere from $500-$560/week after taxes (factoring in possible overtime). Right now, my total income is $765 after taxes/week. I am still losing 25%-30% of my income. Granted, I'm very grateful to have the second job. Just trying to figure out what my options are. That cut will not be easy as I'm the only one working right now.",14,1585141724,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fopzh1/unsure_of_whether_to_file_for_unemployment/,personalfinance,1

fopwko,dirtyhouse2002,Should I temporarily stop contributing to my 401k and build up an emergency fund?,"I’m worried about my financial situation because of what’s going on currently. While there haven’t been layoffs at my job I’m confident it’s only a matter of time. I work in construction industry and some construction projects at my office have stopped while other are on going because they are deemed essential by the state. That to say I’m not feeling 100% about being able to keep my job through this crisis.

This is my current financial situation:

Credit Cards: (1) card with $750 and (1) card with $190

Student Loans: $4,500 with $81 monthly payment. I’ve been over paying to get it down sooner.

401k: $18,000 roughly with a 12% contribute per pay-period which is 2 weeks. My company match since I’ve been with them has consistently been 50% of 6%. 

Savings: $1000. My savings are so low because in Feb. I payed off $5000 in CC, medical bills and student loans from my savings. Part of me was really proud of this move but now I’m feeling anxious about not having enough should I get laid off.

I’m immediately cutting of all unnecessary expenses. One thing I’m wondering is should I stop contributing to my 401k for the next few months to build up a savings or reduce my contribution from 12% to 6% and qualify for a match at the end of the year?",146,1585141398,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fopwko/should_i_temporarily_stop_contributing_to_my_401k/,personalfinance,1

This is all fine and dandy if Michigan hadn't gone into a shutdown mode and Hobby Lobby hadn't closed. Now, come April 1st I will be ""unemployed"". I wasn't fired or let go, but am I still able to file for unemployement due to Covid-19 since the reason I would be unemployed was because Hobby Lobby closed due to the virus?

fopt69,smmstv,"If something gets refunded to your credit card after you've already paid the bill, will the card company put the money back in your bank account? I don't want statement credit.","The title is self explanatory, my friend and I made travel plans, charged them to my credit cards, he gave me his portion of the money, and I paid off the bills.  Now the plans we made are still a few months out, so I haven't cancelled yet, and even if I wanted to, the airlines are only helping people with more immediate plans.  The problem is it's now looking like my job is threatened, and I do have an emergency fund, so I'm not worried, but if I have to cancel I will need the money back in my bank account, and I will owe my friend.  When I've returned stuff in the past, the amount was credited to my card and my bill dropped by that amount.  However, my spending is very low now, and if I have to cancel, the amount refunded will definitely be greater than the bill.  I've heard people saying that the card will just give you a negative balance, meaning you spend up to that amount and don't  have to pay them back, but that's useless to me.  I'd need the money back in my bank account to pay my friend back, and I'd rather not have it stuck as a credit on the card that'll take months, if not a year or more to spend off, and have to pull from savings to pay off my friend.

fopq20,GTEAEYE,Balance transfer / credit building options for “fair” credit,"Hey good morning friends of personal finance!  I am looking for some advice to get me on the right track to excellent or at least better credit.  

Over the last couple years I owned a small business which through many ups and downs ended in a “very very down“ last October.  I had to make some tough decisions that included ignoring the imaginary number to keep a roof over my head, food on my table, and float the business.  I lost that battle and am now gainfully employed, current on all accounts, but unfortunately stuck with that not-so-imaginary-anymore number....

My scores are currently  670/672.  Salary $80k, I have a mortgage in good stanching and about $20k in student loans also in good standing.  I have a few grand in cc debt left over from the business which is now at a pretty hateful rate.  

Id ideally like to get a credit card with a balance transfer option that would allow me to consolidate let’s say $4000 to a low interest situation so that I can get ahead of it.  I’d pretty confidently be able to pay it down inside of a year but maybe not at 28%...   options that I have found seem to require a 700 score.  I’m not really interested in points or even in a PR as I don’t plan to make any new purchases with this card.  Got denied on an application by chase, and found a hard pull on my credit.  From that I see that I can’t just go willy-nilly applying for credit cards.  

Thanks in advance,

fopq10,bradrh,Taking unemployment during COVID and future mortgage loan approval,"I live in the United States and have owned my own business for the last 8 years with 2 other partners. We have done well and I have a solid and stable earnings history. My wife and I currently own a condo in a large metro but will need to move in about 3 years because the schools in our neighborhood are bad and we will have a school age child at that time. I am planning to apply for a mortgage around that time, and am trying to keep our condo as a rental. 

This COVID pandemic hit our business hard, and given how difficult it has been to project our cash flow over the next 2-5 months, we decided that we will not pay our own salaries to safeguard our employees from layoffs until we make it to the other end of this crises, which mind you could be earlier than the COVID pandemic is over - really as soon as businesses open up again we will make money and our business will be fine regardless of what health effects and human costs there are more generally. 

My plan is to eat ramen noodles and pay my mortgage and nothing else for the foreseeable future and I would be able to make my emergency fund last for 8-9 months. Then today we realized that the stimulus would probably allow the partners to take unemployment, which would be incredibly helpful as it would allow to dip less into savings every month (I'm still gonna eat ramen noodles regardless).

HOWEVER --- is taking unemployment going to be a huge problem for getting a mortgage in the future? Obviously not paying ourselves isn't great either but unfortunately we are stuck with no real choice there unless we wanted to layoff all our employees, which I am not going to do as in my opinion that violates the basic social contract of the owner-employee relationship. 

Anyone have experience with this? I know this is an novel situation, but I would hope that someone has taken unemployment and then looked for a mortgage maybe 1-3 years later that could give me an idea.

I have a barely decent salary for my country and no savings to speak of, I rent, and I have a permanent contract with a couple of productivity bonuses and thirteen-month and fourteen-month salaries. Usually 1/4 of my salary is available for whatever I chose to spend it on. The two bonuses are about to come in April and May, then in June there is the 13th. All in all, in addition to my regular salary I will have one and a half salaries extra due to this incomes.

And I have to: replace my 10 years old computer, take IELTS to better qualify for my next job, replace my 3 dental crowns that are causing me grief, pay a deposit (about 1,5 month of salary) to a new landlord to relocate (relocation will be free of charge thanks to friends). I was thinking of paying in instalments for computer and crowns, it will engage 15% of my monthly income... is it sustainable? What should I spend my money on first? The real challenge is to keep my 13th month salary safe to pay a deposit and relocate. 

I also seriously want to find a better job because I used to earn 20% more + ticket restaurants and I want to go back to that. But I am afraid of a slight chance of not successfully pass the trial period (up to 4 months), and if I am paying things in instalments with no savings it can be tough: I will still have the severance pay from this job (about 2 months of full salary) and I would like to have that to help with this set of expenses.

foo2u2,JappenVh,Starting investments,"Hi Redditers,

I'm a 26 year old male from belgium that makes about 50k euros a year. I'm still renting a place to stay (about 500euros/month), but am looking to buy a house in 5 years. For the record, I have zero experience in investments!

What I do know is that the markets are ""crashing"" due to the virus. I was figuring that now might be a good time to start with some investments, since my savings just waste away at a bank...

I don't want to check every week how good/bad my investment are doing, so I've heard that stocks aren't the ideal way. Investing some money and let it sit there for a while would be my way to go (I've read that an ETF might be a good option for me, would this be correct for this case?).

For now, I was planning to invest a part of my savings in S&amp;P 500. I've heard there is quite some diversification in there. Would this be a smart move to do?

An additional question;

Some topics were suggesting to also invest in an additional ETF, for example an international. What are your thoughts about that, and if that might be a good idea, would you have a suggestion for a more international ETF?

Thanks a lot!",3,1585132351,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foo2u2/starting_investments/,personalfinance,1

fonxzq,janegetsit,Chase Bank - Fraud,"Earlier this month I received an email from Chase Fraud alert stating that a transaction was denied due to possible fraud. At this time I realized that my debit card was missing. I quickly called and disputed the charges that weren’t mine.

This morning I received notice that the credit they placed on my account in the amount that was disputed will be taken out because: the transactions were valid. 

I was baffled, and pissed off. Called back Chase. They told me that since the debit card was a contactless card ( unique ID for each transaction) and was present at Point of sale, that it was me. She also told me that my PIN was used at the time. I know it wasn’t, because the amount in question was used at a popular fast food restaurant chain and I know for certain that the POS doesn’t ask for a PIN when purchasing. Furthermore, the person who took my card tried to take money out of an ATM and was denied for : wrong PIN. 

What recourse do I have? The customer service rep gave me the suggestion of going after the restaurant for my money back, which to me is a joke. Is Chase really this bad?

fonk3z,hazybanter,Should I still keep asking for my annual review that is over two months late?,"This past January was my two year anniversary and I have yet to receive an annual review. I brought this to my managers attention mid February after suspecting that they completely forgot (which they did; but also noted it was HRs responsibility to remind managers so they forgot as well). 

Okay, fine, honest mistake. Upsetting that multiple people forgot but that tends to happen to me. I wait about a week then get in touch with my manager about scheduling it. They mention that they are on it and will give me a date soon. Again, fine. I’m just glad things seem to be moving. 

My manager and I touch base a week later (now early March) and they inform me that they are still waiting on HR to review their notes. My manager said they will reach out when they are ready to schedule. A little over a week has passed after that encounter and I have heard nothing. Now it is the beginning of the pandemic and hearing talks about working remotely I’m worried it will get pushed back even more. I reach out to HR about when I can expect my annual review to be scheduled and their response was that my manager should have already scheduled it. Frustrating, but this is not the first time management &amp; HR have been disorganized. 

Email my manager that same day and they send me a calendar invite of for the following week. Perfect, finally! The day comes and my manager decides to reschedule for later that week due to everything that is going on (management has been in more meeting due to the Coronavirus).

Next day my company decides to have certain employees work remotely for part of the week and my annual review is on a day where I would be at home. I ask my manager if the review is still on for that day (come in for the review) or if we should video chat for it. They said it would be done remotely. Day of the review they decide it should be done in person so they push it back to the following Tuesday. 

That day was yesterday March 24th. No annual review. I did not mention it nor remind my manager about it. I’m beyond frustrated. I feel as though I have been extremely patient in this process and am frankly tired of asking. 

Should I keep asking? I feel as though I’m  now nagging about it and I’m sick of excuse after excuse. I understand now is a difficult/stressful time for management but this could have been taken care of weeks ago. 

I’m at the point where I don’t want it to happen. I’m a good employee and any raise I receive would be back paid but this has been ridiculous. It is clear how valued I am at the company and it has been effecting my self esteem. The cherry on top of this shit sundae is it would be difficult to find a job elsewhere.

I’ve been with 5/3, Wells Fargo and now Huntington. They all participate in this overdraft policy. I have declined overdraft protection because I believe that is how they overdraft your account on payments that aren’t pre-authorized. 

Today my account at Huntington was overdrawn from a purchase I made at Macy’s on 3/2. I bought a lot of clothes but they kept the clothes until 3/20 because of a sale they were having. So after 3 weeks of the money not coming out of my account and having never received the items I payed for I assumed everything was fine.

P.S. I did this at another Macy’s the next day and the money came out of my account no problem.

Huntington’s excuse is that the payment was pre-authorized. They tried to pay Macy’s but the company didn’t take the money so they put the money back into my account. Therefore when Macy’s charged again on 3/23 they payed them even though there was no longer enough money for that charge. 

I’m upset at Macy’s too but this is a bigger problem I no longer want to deal with. It is especially frustrating during these times. I have no income right now but am fortunate enough to have money saved up that I hadn’t given to Huntington.

fomjsz,Blonde67,Paying for prescriptions without insurance?,"Hi. I recently lost my health insurance. I am currently looking for a new job that offers health insurance but I am not sure what to do in the meantime. I only need something temporarily.. I tried to apply for Medicaid and did so on the [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) website. They said I didn't qualify but asked if I wanted to still send it to my state Medicaid agency anyway, is this worth doing? Is there any chance they would accept it? They said to have it sent if you need a lot of medical services or have high medical bills, which I do. How would they know this though? Will they ask my medical history if I fill out another form, the one on [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) didn't ask anything like that...I really thought I would qualify because I am temporarily unemployed but my state also didn't do the Medicaid expansion so I am assuming maybe this is why I don't qualify?  I also looked at the Marketplace plans on [healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov) because they acted like they offered cheaper insurance, most of the plans they are showing me aren't very affordable though. Looking under the cheaper plans they offer under the prescription coverage it says no charge after the deductible, so does this mean none of my medication would be covered until I spend over $8,000? The others say $40 generic and 50% coinsurance after deductible, most my medications don't have a generic so do these other plans also not cover them? The only ones that show actual dollar amounts are the most expensive 2 plans and I can't afford them, even when I had a job, they are more than my paycheck for the month...Do I have any other options? I don't really care about any of the coverage for visits or anything else because I'm not going to be visiting the doctor unless I'm basically dying, but I do need it for my prescriptions because without insurance they are thousands more than I can afford. I figured I can probably skip some of my medicine for a while, I will be very sick but I think I can live without a few of them for a bit. But I at least need to fill my blood thinners which are still $700 a month without insurance..

fomgiw,SkippyMGee,Having trouble sleeping and wondering if I can get some solid advice here.,"First of all, I'm Canadian, but dating an American who is relentlessly trying to get me to immigrate down there. 

Turning 36 next week. I got laid off months ago and the job search has been from hell. This virus is not helping either as I am severe asthmatic and extremely worried about getting even a job at a store or another place that I can contract this virus. I transferred about $40k from my old public pension fund - I could only transfer about $25k into a LIRA and had to take a $14k lump sum pay out (which the government took about $3k of, and it also kicked me off of EI) after listening to extremely foolish advice from my accountant. In the last two weeks that $25k is now $19k - and I'm living off of what I desperately need as my retirement money.

I have about $36k in a HISA, and about $2k in my TFSA. Other than that I have about $14k in another pension fund that I am absolutely not touching at the moment. I have no employment prospects, single, no kids, no debt, also no property either - I rent.

It seems like I need to re-train but then I'd be starting at 37 or 38 with pretty close to nothing. 

Shoot it to me straight because I need this - how fucked am I right now? Honestly - is retirement and property ownership even a possibility at this point? 

I'm just trying to think of something here - anything - to get me to sleep because I am in full panic zone right now. I can't get anything right now, let alone save $18,000 - $20,000 a year.

fomewq,house_saver_guy,"30 y/o saving for house. Salary is 100k, average house is 670k (San Diego) here. Is this feasible and is it a smart choice? Any tips or words of wisdom? Breakdown included.","I just turned 30 2 weeks ago and made it a goal to save up for a house when I turned this age. I graduated college late at 27. I have around 85k saved (pre market crash/coronavirus... I didn't look at it recently to save myself heartache) for retirement right now and live with my parents. Currently cash poor because I'm finishing up on paying off my debts and had poor spending habits because I spent a lot of time traveling and hobbies. I'm currently selling a lot of hobby item's I'm no longer interested in. I'm cutting all my frivolous spending as of this month. I live in San Diego.

I'm fortunate to have the safety net of my parents who are wealthy and can afford to have me live at home. 2023 is when I finish the payment to my car that is currently the only debt that I have. I'm only using 2023 as a goal because that is when I'm done paying for my car and I will have no more debts. I don't think I care too much about trying to time a recession.

Breakdown of my current situation:

|Category|$|Notes|
:--|--:|:--|
|Net Take home (Taxes/medical/401k/etc)|4290|Used to be much lower, but now&amp;nbsp;
I only do bare minimum for employermatch|
|Roth IRA|-500|I pay (max of year)/12 every month|
|Car (Standard and Principal)|-520|Done 03/23|
|Credit Card (Medical + failed business)|-500|Done 11/20 No Interest|
|Show/movie subs|-19|Hulu + Disney Plus|
|Groceries|-250|I also chip in for my family|
|Eating out|-100|May adjust this|
|Gas|-100||
|Misc Necessities (paid yearly or every 6 months)|-300|Amazon/Car Insurance/Car Registration/etc|
|Entertainment/Fun??|-200|Not sure what this should be yet|


Misc Necessities are just lumped things I don't want to calculate right now like Amazon, Car Insurance, Car Registration, internet, surprise spending like car repairs, etc. After all of this, my real take home is currently 1801. In November, when I am done paying for the credit card debt (I had some surgeries recently... ouch), my real take home will will be ~2301, and my only debt will be the car. I do owe 6.5k in taxes this year due to an error I made, but I have enough in my emergency saving to cover that. 

Amazon may or may not be a necessity, but I do use it instead of driving to stores (groceries included). I still see value in being subbed to it because I also do shopping for my family on here and I don't drive to any stores to save gas. 

I live in San Diego, and the market is pretty expensive with the average house is currently at 670k. This seems expensive even at a 100k salary. Although I am also able to find decent houses at around 525-560k in the more ""out of way of the main jobs areas"" such as Santee, La Mesa, and Escondido. I'm making it a goal for myself to make at least 120k next year, either by getting a new job or having a side hustle. Better if I can do both! 

I'm hoping that I can do all, if not most of the down payment myself by 2023, however, I'm also wondering if buying a house with a single income is a good idea. And if I intend to buy a house in a few years, should I not put any money into the market and just save in a high yield saving account? Assuming I'm just saving and not investing,with the current table, I can save around 75000 by 2023 (also counting after my credit card debt is done). That's also just a down payment... I haven't included the extra fees, mortgage, and possible repairs and stuff. I'm assuming I can be paying 3100-3300 in mortgage? I intend to have roommates to offset the cost. 

I'm fortunate to have the safety net of my wealthy parents, but they've already paid for both the 20% down payment for both my brother and sister, and I don't to be an extra strain on them with down payments. They moved out in their mid 20s while I stayed :(. 

TLDR: Assuming I live by this chart that I made, I can save around 75000 by 2023. I intend to make more than 100k next year. Is it worth buying a house on a single income if I do intend to live here very long term? Is it a smart choice? What would be a realistic price range for me in San Diego?",1,1585122741,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fomewq/30_yo_saving_for_house_salary_is_100k_average/,personalfinance,1

The story is I was receiving government assistance stopped in 2016 when I began working again, apparently I was overcharged by 5k over the duration of when I was getting assistance(few years span) I had no knowledge of this. 

Fast forward to 2020, I went to my old address(where my mother lives) and saw I had a letter saying they’ll be taking 15% of my check from this point forward until the balance is paid, I received this letter in February .

I checked my Credit Karma and now the account has appeared on my credit report, it’s not listed under derogatory but instead just an account that’s “in collections/charge off” side note: I have 100% payment history, and 5 credit cards, 1 auto loan, no derogatory, and I just recently used my last check from work to pay the balance on all of my cards that were maxed out putting me at 0% utilization. I’m hoping this account doesn’t hurt my credit I’m trying to rebuild.

I was recently laid off from my job and luckily got a new one almost immediately, my new job says they still have to do a background check which is fine, but they also said they’ll be checking into my collections to see if I have any outstanding balances.. bad luck.

I don’t have the finances to pay this whole $5.5k in one lump some, once I start my new job I’ll have no problem paying it soon.

My questions is: what do I do regarding this account? Do I call and set up a payment plan? Do I wait until I have a decent amount saved up and try to negotiate a certain amount with collections? Is there anything I can do if this disqualifies me for my new job?

Sorry if this isn’t a question to ask here, I’m just not that knowledgeable when it comes to this sort of thing and my way around Reddit.

follpg,btbasinger1029,Credit Repair Question(s),"Needing some input. My husband and I are early 30's (not sure that's relevant but I'm also eating M&amp;M's so there's that) and are in process of trying hard to get back on the right track with our credit. Going to try and give you a brief synopsis of our current sitchy-ation:

We were idiots when we first got married.

We ended up foreclosing on our home.

We had a repo on a vehicle.

We had numerous delinquent accounts on our credit history.

Since then we have turned our lives around and have been working hard to get where we are today.

Our default judgements/foreclosure/repo are all past the 7 year mark. My credit is worse and will take more work/time however my husbands as of last night is basically clear. No judgements. No delinquent accounts. Nothing at all. Which is part of the problem... there's NOTHING to report so it's basically saying he doesn't have enough credit history to generate an accurate Credit Score. We don't own any loans home/car/or personal. (we are on a land contract with our current home and will hopefully be financing the remaining $20,000 within the next 2 years). We have no credit cards. Only 1 debit. HOWEVER, he was able to apply for and actually got approved for a  Cap 1 Credit Card with a low credit limit today. We are thankful for the card so that Cap 1 can be an agency that gives us a positive report once he begins making timely payments. We think he will charge his gas to and from work on it and pay it off each month. Credit Karma and Experian both recommend he has a few more credit lines open so they can report. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all.. how would you recommend we go about this? Should we open up credit cards? Should we do something different? We basically just want to get him on a positive and helpful trajectory so we can end up financing the remainder of our home soon and be on our way to a little bit of financial freedom.

folk3t,ryansfirstreddit,Charter/Spectrum Collections Error,"I closed my account with Spectrum/Charter in NYC in Feb 2018.  I returned all equipment to the store that same month.  The following month I received closing statement from Spectrum with a ~$50 bill for unreturned equipment.  Took me multiple calls and hours on the phone with Spectrum in March 2018 to convince them I in-fact did return the equipment to their store and it was a processing error on their end.  Unfortunately I didn’t keep the receipt from the store when I returned the equipment which would make this all much easier.  After all the calls in March 2018 this was put to bed with me having no outstanding debt and Spectrum closing the account without issue.  It seemed ok but I had a bad feeling that wasn’t the end of the drama.  Two years later I get a letter from a collection agency for $50 out outstanding debt from Spectrum.  I have sent a letter to the collection agency disputing the debt.  I also called Spectrum and they have verified there is no debt or any record of it.  I then sent it to an escalations department who can now see an unreturned equipment note on the account and have opened an investigation.  I am working through the process with both Spectrum and the collection agency, but most of all I am just pissed off that all responsibility lies on me in this and I am fighting through endless wait times, transferring, and hand written letters to get fixed.  

Any advice on this would be appreciated.  I feel like I am doing everything possible but really hate the system right now.",1,1585117899,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/folk3t/charterspectrum_collections_error/,personalfinance,1

Recently shopped around for an Auto Refinance and Bank of America initially approved me for a great rate. Cool. Go to call the loan specialist because they never reached out to me and after a bit, he goes, ""Yeah I can't find your address in our system and because of that I have to decline the application."" I was frustrated and he told me to check my Experian credit report that I get free yearly for any info on why they can't verify my address.

I've been at my new apartment since November 2019 so it's not like I just moved here. 

I get pretty bummed that my good credit score is going to tank and say screw it, let me take a look at my Experian report like he said.

Well it's there. My address is there. My current one.

I call back and told him this news hoping he'd see what's up. Nope, pretty much just kept going I can't find you oh well declined. I asked to speak to the manager and he said that the manager would call back in 24-48 hours. I'll hold my breath. 

My question to you guys is: what's going on? Why was I initially approved and then now they decline it saying they can't verify my address? Why does my address show up literally everywhere else but BoA, including Navy Federal who also approved me and verified my address? Why is it not possible to send them my lease agreement, my credit card bills, my insurance info, my job details that have my current address on there? How bad is my credit score going to tank?

fol2oc,spit_finger,My wife can’t get a hold of her tax transcript from the IRS and it might prevent us from closing on our house,"My wife and I bought a house in 2018 that was in need of repairs before we could move into it. I’m talking uninhabitable, so when we closed we had to get a construction loan rather than a typical homeowner loan. We have since remodeled the house and moved in late last summer as we finished the renovations. Now that the house is complete, we are going through the process of refinancing the loan as a homeowners loan with a much lower interest rate than the construction loan. But we hit a snag. 

Because of an error that my dad made when he helped us file our taxes for 2018 (he accidentally put the wrong social for my wife on her return), our lender cannot get a copy of my wife’s tax transcript from the IRS. She (our lender) said we would have to call the IRS to get them to fix the error and send her a copy of the transcript. She only told us this in early March, after we had already locked in our loan with the bank. 

My wife was able to get the IRS to send us verification of the error but they did not give her access to the transcript and instead sent a letter stating that she would need to verify her identity before the could process the return. We got this letter in the mail last week and my wife has been calling the number trying to get in touch with someone to verify her return but I guess they are overwhelmed or something right now because of COVID-19. We’re both working from home now and she called today and yesterday at least 5 times each but we still haven’t been able to get in touch with anyone.  

In the meantime, we were supposed to close on the new loan this week but our lender is staying she needs the transcript to proceed. Our lender has extended the lock on our interest rate til April 7th but told us after that it would “expire.” She then said “The tax transcripts are vital. Those need to be received prior to closing. I was suggest calling every and perhaps several times per day. Maybe speak to your CPA. They may be able to help.”

I don’t have a CPA to help with this, and we didn’t realize the tax return was in error until after we had proceeded with the loan. We have been calling the IRS but because of the insane pandemic emergency going on we are unable to get in touch. Does anyone have a suggestion for how we can navigate this? Do we just keep calling and hope we win the telephone lottery to talk to the IRS before April 7? Or should I hire a CPA to help us out? 


TLDR: My wife and I are trying to close on a loan but we need to verify her identity with the IRS in order to get a transcript of her return. The transcript is needed for closing the loan. But due to coronavirus we can’t get on the phone with the IRS. Is there a faster option than just calling non-stop?",8,1585115209,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fol2oc/my_wife_cant_get_a_hold_of_her_tax_transcript/,personalfinance,1

Turns out they ran payroll twice for November last year, and later reversed both contributions. Hence my actual contribution was missing. The contribution was never paid back or reported on any 1099-R or W-2, etc. - So they basically stole the money.

After reporting this to the former employer they admitted that this has been a payroll problem for all employees, but basically just directed us at the 401k providers support. After weeks of emails and phone calls they finally admitted the error and reversed the reversal.

After all this settled I informed the former employer of the outcome again. Now more than two weeks later I have checked with former colleagues and the company is not doing anything about it, although they also see the same error...

I'm wondering the legalities of what I just received and if I can apply for unemployment. I am located in California, I know state laws differ.

You would be eligible to apply for unemployment benefits at the end of the LOA period, i.e. after Monday, June 22, 2020.

fojc74,facingthewinter,Job loss in the middle of a new construction home,"Sorry this turned out so long

**TLDR: Our household income has been reduced by 55%. We are in the middle of a new construction build. Estimated mortgage will now be 30% of my gross income. Should we proceed? What are our options?**

My husband and I signed a contract to purchase a new construction home back in November. We put 10% down of the agreed purchase price, but the builder has his own construction loan and the contract says we agree to buy it from him with a mortgage when complete. Our original completion date was 4/15, but we had a lot of weather set backs and have been expecting closer to 5/1. Around 3/1 we contacted the bank to start our mortgage application process. Our lender recommended we wait 2 weeks since new construction is never on time. Boy can a lot change in 2 weeks. 

My husband and I work for the same company, except that my husband is technically a consultant for them and is paid by a consulting firm. Monday my company told me my salary is being reduced 12%. Today my husbands contract was cancelled. Our combined income has dropped to 45% of what it once was. 

I have no idea what we should do. We’ll obviously look into unemployment for my husband, but the whole future is so uncertain I don’t know what we should do about our home. If we continue with the build, the mortgage will be ~30% of my **gross pay**. Before this, it would’ve been 26% of our **take home** pay after maxing retirements. We are pretty frugal people and even that 26% made us uneasy. 

There is a chance my husband could get rehired whenever all this mess is over, but there’s also a chance he could not. And with an expected 30% unemployment rate, I can’t imagine finding a different job will be easy. 

What is the responsible thing to do here?Commit to a mortgage that will be pretty uncomfortable to pay? Lose the 10% and walk away? We have enough cash that if we only used our savings to pay the mortgage (and my income for regular expenses) we could do that for over a year. 

If anyone made it this far and is interested in specifics:

New gross income: $86,240
Cash Savings: $81,000
Purchase price: $430,000
Earnest money given: $42,150",10,1585106927,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fojc74/job_loss_in_the_middle_of_a_new_construction_home/,personalfinance,1

The owner makes the cakes, GF's mom makes the muffins. They both come from old money and live in the south, and I don't think they even really need these jobs. I don't want my girlfriend's super conservative parents thinking I'm looking for hand outs or something.

It's just a really weird situation that involves my personal life, a really sweet lady who works with me when I need time off for college, and has been so nice to me while working together.

foiltu,NeedBailout,Help! I'm Sinking Ship!,"Sorry for the dramatic title, but I feel like just that. 


Background, I'm 42, went through a divorce couple years ago, bought out all the debt, kept the house and all assets. Needless to say, I have a lot of liability and need a plan to get to on my way paying debt off. I need ideas on how to best do this.


Current income/savings:
* Semi-monthly paycheck: $4,000 in hand
* 401K contribution: 10% (need this for max. company match)
* Annual bonus: $2,000
* 401K balance: $150,000 (as of today, 3/24/2020)
* Crypto Investment: $8,500
* Kid college fund (in stocks): $2,500K (not willing to withdraw)


Current liabilities: monthly payment; balance
* Mortgage: $2,300; balance $250K
* Home Equity loan: $500; balance $44K
* CC1: $2000; $42K (15% APR)
* CC2: $500; $24K (15% APR)
* Personal Loan 1: $220; $6500 (10% APR)
* Personal Loan 2: $1120; $20,500 (6% APR)
* Car Payment: $850; $14,000
* No child support or alimony (phew!)
* Food/Utility/Household/Insurance/Gas/everything else: $2,000


I don't waste much eating/drinking out etc. so not much scope to save there. 


As you can see, monthly commitments are $9K and income is $8K. In 18 months, once car and 'personal loan 2' is paid off, I won't have to pay 2K, so i'll get some room to breathe. In the meanwhile, need to figure out how to consolidate debt/create a plan to repay.

foikgp,ITQuestionThrAwy,Salary Negotiation,"Hey guys,  


Throw away account because my coworkers know about my other account... I don't want to put them into any awkward positions. Backstory - I live in Canada working in IT Security. Nearly done my Bachelor of Computer Science with a Focus in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics. I was hired by this company as a Security Analyst for (\~35,000/year). I've been with them for (almost) 8 months now.  


I've done extremely well here, two ""accommodations"" for outstanding performance, both from very high levels in the company (think Directors/VP and C-Level).

Anyways, they want to hire me right out of University. My plans with the company are odd, and getting into specifics will certainly reveal who I am. But they're extremely expensive, difficult to achieve and will take probably the next year and a half, if not two to actually complete. I can safely ballpark what we've been talking about will easily cost them $15,000, and a whack of time from HR and myself. They're also more then aware that what we've been working towards is ultimately my pipe dream. Whether it's with them, a different company or on my own, I will do it. That all being said, With the contract being written up, is it really appropriate to ""negotiate"" with them? I have no idea what the contract will be, hours, salary, benefits etc. In some ways, I feel it's only fair. By the time I'm done school, I'll hold 3 more certs, 2 of which are expert certifications (CISSP and OSCP). I'll also have my BCS. I also don't have the experience of my other coworkers (who, at my level at least make \~45-60k depending on certs, degrees etc). In others, like considering my ultimate goal, even if they offer me my current salary, that combined with the other benefits and the dream will put me way into the the upper range of what my coworkers make.  


This is my first ""real"" job, especially in what will eventually be my career. The semantics of pushing for what you're worth I definitely don't understand yet. Advice?",6,1585103631,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foikgp/salary_negotiation/,personalfinance,1

Or, should I just find an apartment? I feel like saving money while living in an apartment will be harder, and make my dream of buying a house that much longer? I don’t have any money in retirement accounts and I do not have a 403b.

 $23,000 (yearly w/ dorm, tuition, food plan &amp; books)
- 8,500 (renewal scholarships)
- 5,500 (both federal student loans)
I predict about $9,000 left over for a private student loan. Both of my parents can not afford the remaining balance, so I have to get the rest in loans. 

 I have thought about transferring from a community college, but the drive to the nearest cc is about 45 mins from my house. This would tackle on more miles on my car, maintenance and extra time wasted commuting. I really enjoy this school and my program starts for first year students only, which would put me behind if I transfer. I also have about 30 general education college credits hours transferring in from high school as well.
I have determined I will get a job on campus to afford miscellaneous expenses. The following years I plan to apply to be a RA to get my dorm/meal covered, leaving about $3,000 yearly in loans for the rest 3 years. I am just wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me about dealing with federal student loans and private student loans. I know the difference mostly, could just use some advice from anyone willing and knowledge about tackling student loans.

Total Debt: $ 20,980.

Breakdown:

* Credit Cards - **$1,377**
* Collections - **$1,015**
* Student Loans - **$8,700**
* Auto Loans - **$9,888**

I've recently applied for a credit card that would be used to pay off collection and total credit card debt. Luckily, I was denied because I have recently learned that my credit score would not benefit from applying all credit to a single card as much as it would with a personal loan. I applied for a personal loan. Sadly, I was denied and was recommended to take care of my accounts in collections. Well, without the available funds to do so, I am at a loss. 

My student loans are currently in a period of forbearance but are still a concern due to interest. 

The auto loan is a worrisome factor due to a high-interest rate, which I am hoping to get refinanced but due to my current credit score, is not an option. 

Does anyone out there have any type of recommendation for personal loan lenders(?) and, or how I should go about tackling this situation. 

Please forgive me for any typos. If some things are not clear, I will do my best to clarify.

foi1xg,Dark-Helmet_,Problems with getting a mortgage refi to remove MIP (Mortgage Insurance),"I currently have an FHA mortgage with an additional Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) on it each month.  I took out the mortgage in late 2016, and at the time was only a few years out of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  From what I recall, in order for me to be included on the mortgage and the deed (and be able to get it), I had to take out the mortgage with my parents and put down 20% and have MIP as part of the mortgage.  

In hindsight, I probably should have waited a few more years.  I'm trying to figure out a way to refi right now in order to at least get rid of the MIP.  I'm almost at 7 years from when the Ch. 7 bankruptcy was discharged, but my big problems at this point are that I'm self-employed and don't show a lot of income (I'm able to deduct a lot) and my parents are both retired now and don't show much income either.  

My credit score is very good (in the 730's), I've never missed a payment on the mortgage, and I've been in business for myself for 11 years - but I think the big problem is the debt-to-income ratio.  We've talked to the mortgage broker that helped us a few years ago but he says at this point there's nothing we can do (even with my parents on the refi again).  

It's not the end of the world if I'm stuck with the MIP, but I'd like to save some money considering what's going on with the economy and saving money at this point is probably a good thing.  

Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?  Are there any non-conventional routes I can take?

My thinking is the salary is one of the best by far already from all her other offers even after COL factored in. On top with this Corona issues I wonder if we even have much leverage so maybe best for her to negotiate her self?

fohbkt,SDo-000,Supporting Relatives,"I have a general question about supporting two relatives going forward.

My mother is disabled an unable to work, most likely permanently.  If I were to provide full financial support for all her expenses while she continued to live in a different state in a home I own, would this be considering gifting her money?

Additionally, I would do the same for an uncle.  He isn't disabled but has been a great help in supporting me over the decades and I'd like to repay that by retiring him and paying all his expenses going forward.  He would continue to live in a different state and live in his own home.  

Instead of giving them money, I had intended to put a monthly allowance in separate bank accounts that I own, give them debit cards to those accounts, and allow them access those funds (with monthly replenishments).  I thought that if I weren't transferring money to them, it wouldn't be considered taxable income to them but rather be considered support by me to each of them.

Can anyone identify any problems with this plan?  Would there be a better way of doing this?  I plan to contact a professional about this in the near future but I thought the reddit community might have some insight before I do, so I don't go in blind.

fohbjw,mleopleuro,No hassle refi too good to be true?,"Also posted on r/homeowners before someone suggested to come here. 

My mortgage lender has been after me for a couple months about an offer to refi my loan at a lower rate, with no credit check, income verification, or appraisal. I ignored it for a bit since it sounds way too good to be true but finally caved and called. 

They offered me a 1/2 point reduction, about a $100 drop per month at my same remaining loan term (so no additional years) they pay closing costs, and all I need to supply is a utility bill. 

I asked the guy upfront how this benefits them. He said the biggest benefit is that they retain me as a customer as most people end up switching lenders for refi. 

I’m about 2.5 years into my loan, I have never missed a payment or been late so I am a good customer, and while I agree with shopping around I have a financial plan that would put me in a better spot in a few years for a refi.

foh9u2,keep-it-dl,Do I take a new contract job if there’s not much work in my current permanent job?,"
I’m in a situation where prior to SHTF, I was in talks with recruiters as I’m at a dead end job where I don’t have much work to do and wanted to advance my career. Here is the situation:

Current job:
- financial lending industry
- working at home but there is not much work to do at all. I pretty much login and wait for work if there is any. I feel expendable if there is a cut.
- big team 
- I started with them 1.5 year ago as the only external hire on the team. Mostly everyone has seniority over me.

New job:
- financial investment company 
- will be able to work from home. Recruiter said they have hired employees that are on boarding there remotely right now.
- pay raise and title raise but it’s a 12 month contract to cover for maternity
- lean team so I should have more work
- great asset for my resume 

The kicker is I work for offline marketing in my current job which is risky as lockdown is restricting traffic to our physical stores so there’s even less work than normal. On the flip side, my new job will be online marketing but for the recruitment department... Although there is brand building and long term goals of recruitment marketing, this is worrying to me. They have not retracted my offer or any other offers they have currently despite the economic climate. There is also a clock ticking for hiring as the person I will be covering for will be gone in a month. 

I personally don’t feel safe in either job so I don’t know what to do. What are your thoughts?

Also I’m in Canada, so even if I got let go at my new job, I should still qualify for EI as I’ve been working full time consistently?",0,1585098395,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foh9u2/do_i_take_a_new_contract_job_if_theres_not_much/,personalfinance,1

foh3co,drkirienko,One Time Contribution to Retirement Plan,"Hello! 

Thank you for reading this and double thanks for any advice. 

I and my spouse have retirement accounts managed by TIAA CREF. They are 401(A) accounts, as far as I can tell, but there is *probably* also a 403(b). One of these is contributed by our employer and one is contributed to by us. We are not maxing our contributions at this point. 

In case it helps, the stock symbol for the fund is . I am fairly sure its a mutual fund, but if I am wrong, I will humbly be corrected. 

My question is this: We have some money readily available in our high-yield savings. (We maintain an emergency fund of about $60K in the bank as liquid, but when it reaches about $10K over, we divest it, typically into a large payment of our mortgage. However, our 15 year mortgage is coming up in maybe 3 years so the amount we're paying toward interest at this point is pretty minimal. The APR on the mortgage is 2.75% and there were no closing costs, so it's pretty close to that on APY as well.) Since we're nearing payoff on our mortgage, contributing to it seems to have a lower long-term yield than a significant contribution to our retirement in the current market. 

Is it possible to dump $10-15K as a one-time thing into our accounts? We are mid-30s, so we cannot use ""make up pay"" to surpass contribution limits, but we contribute less than maximum. Is there a mechanism we can use to make this contribution from cash? Or do we need to change our payroll contribution and spread it across a few paychecks? (I'd rather do it at once, aiming to hit a weekly or monthly low in the market, rather than end up doing it when the market bounces 1500 points on my payday.

Any advice appreciated. Let me know if more details are necessary.",3,1585097676,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foh3co/one_time_contribution_to_retirement_plan/,personalfinance,1

fogc8w,EmoJarsh,Question About HSA Bank Account,"Hello,

I've maintained an HSA across several employers but as of my most recent job move I noticed that I'm being charged fees every month to maintain the account, apparently my employer used to pay these but my current one does not.

After looking around a bit I saw lots of recommendations for Lively and initiated an HSA Transfer to them (my old provider is HealthEquity if that matter). That process is still ongoing, I only initiated it 6 Days ago.

The problem I've run into is my old HSA Provider also had a bank account that I would inform my employer of so they could make the contributions out of my pay. Lively doesn't do this, you have to link a Bank Account to them.

This is where I'm running into some confusion. I have my main Checking/Savings and no other, non-CC accounts. Because of the Coronavirus the amount of banking I can do is limited, pretty much only drive-through and over the phone stuff.

Is this as simple as opening up a new Savings account with any bank and using that for my HSA deposits? And if so is there a reputable bank I can do so with online or via the phone? Pretty much every bank has their lobbies closed in my area until further notice.

Totally my fault for not doing more digging before I initiated the transfer but now I'm a bit up against it and the faster I resolve this the better.",3,1585094850,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fogc8w/question_about_hsa_bank_account/,personalfinance,1

My wife and I have been covered for all of 2019 on my ""self plus one"" high deductible health plan through my employer. We each have our own HSA accounts.

fofjhj,givemeafreakingclue,Young person (22) confused about finances/investments in the midst of the apocalypse - CAN,"Hi good people of personal finance!
I've been a lurker for a long time, and while I've been meaning to post to ask about smart investments, I never got around to it. However, in the midst of all this craziness, and the tanking of the stock market, I need some advice.
I have had a job since I was 15, and saving money pretty well over the past 5-ish years, but I had never opened any account other than a normal savings account with a low interest rate. Last June, I decided I should go to my bank and open 2 investment accounts with them - 1 low and 1 low-medium risk. The first of which is my RRSP (registered retirement savings plan) - I did this bearing in mind that in Canada you are able to withdraw money from your RRSP if and only if you plan to use this money for a down payment. The other account is just a TFSA (tax-free savings account).
At the time of opening these accounts, I put $5000 in my RRSP and $7000 in my TFSA and have been contributing $100 into each account every month. That means in the months since opening these accounts, I have contributed $900 to each. The RRSP was over $6000 (not sure the exact amount) prior to my March deposit, and my TFSA was just over $8100 (again, before March deposit).
I opened my banking app yesterday to find that my RRSP was at $5230 and my TFSA was at $7200. I just checked again while making this post to find my RRSP at $5179 and my TFSA at $7118.
I talked to my parents yesterday and they gave me conflicting advice. My mum told me I should try to appeal to the bank - I'm young, I've already lost a lot of money, let me out of these investments. My dad told me to leave it - stocks are gonna plummet and then rise again, and anyway we'll all be fucked together after this shitstorm blows over.
I know that this is a scary and confusing time for many, but as someone who has not witnessed a depreciation this quickly and doesn't have much experience in stocks/ investments.... what the fuck should I do?
At the very least I'm gonna speak to my bank about withdrawing contributions to the accounts moving forward. But I'm scared I'm about to lose all my money which previously had been sitting nicely in my savings account, bothering nobody and making a small amount of interest. All of a sudden I have lost $1500 of my own money not including any interest made (which was at least $300 in each account).

fofbd4,nomoneymillenial,Car Insurance Property Damage Question,"Back in October, my girlfriend borrowed my car and totaled it, in the process damaging two other cars, a fence, and a pole. She was at fault, and didn't have car insurance since she doesn't own a car. My parents have generously been covering my car insurance premiums for the past couple years while I'm in grad school, and unwittingly selected a plan with very low property damage coverage--only 5 grand. They were shocked by this, as their other policies cover 50 grand (it's likely that they misread the policy). My parents have agreed to help us pay for the bills when they come, and now they finally are beginning to arrive. I feel really awful about the whole situation, and really do not want my parents to be bailing out their adult son, but I am not in a position to pay for this by myself right now, nor is my better half.

One insurance company sent a letter asking for $2,500. Our insurance company advised us to call back and say we can't afford it, and see what happens next. My girlfriend did just that, and was informed the bill would then go to collections. I'm guessing this is a process that will repeat itself with the other parties as well.

Is there room to negotiate with my insurance company to raise the property damage coverage retroactively? My parents have been customers at this company for decades, and were genuinely shocked by how low the coverage was, which was out of step with the other policies they have. Failing that, is it possible to negotiate with the various people who are going to start calling in the debt?

I need an opinion.. my husband booked a trek through a company and it included his accommodations, food, etc. all in all, it cost about 1600. The trek was in South America but due to the virus, the National Park was shut down.. so, the company obviously can no longer provide the services. They are refusing to give a refund but willing to give a credit for next season (next year). My husband can’t take this trip next year. He was transitioning into a new job so he had the time now, but won’t be able to go next year.. so in the end, even that credit will be useless and we will lose the 1600. If I could use the credit, I would have taken it. Am I being unreasonable? Or is it crazy that they aren’t giving refunds for something they can’t even honor right now..

foeya2,Olliesmitten,"First time homebuyer, just breaking even w/mortgage, wondering if I should sell my home soon.","Hey guys,
I've felt a bit over my head in buying my first home. I'm pretty well off and have a fairly steady income but I still am just breaking even with mortgage/utilities. My total wages for last year: 83,908, and recently had a 5.7% pay increase. My question is would it be better to sell my house or refinance?

I bought my house just over a year ago for 347,500. Currently according to zillow the estimate for my house is 370,486 and on redfin 370,640. 
If I sell now, I would pay a capital gains tax of 15%, so around 3,448. And that's if I end up selling at 370,000, which I kind of doubt will happen.
My mortgage is sitting at 2,212 a month not including utilities, gas, garbage &amp; recycling and internet. The loan is for 329,815.00 w/APR of 4.250%. Last I checked my credit is 783.
Right now it's just me living alone in this house.  I had dreams that this house would be a forever/family home, but recently went through a breakup. It's way more space than I need and I'm struggling w/ upkeep and keeping it clean. I would love to put an end to the financial and emotional stress and sell this house, but I'm wondering if this would be a dumb financial decision. The market right now seems okay for selling but I have no experience and the stress from the thought of selling is enough to make me not want to sell at all. Any guidance will be appreciated!

My wife attended LISMA language school for their TOEFL classes and we made 2K payment in December before her break. Her semester started in February 7th and in February 15th we told the school that we would not take class and would like to get a refund. They told us that we are eligible for 50% refund (1K) and should expect to get a check in two weeks. (it was all verbal, we were told by one of the advisors). Now it has been 4 weeks and we still did not receive the money. Tried to reach out to an advisor and been told that it takes up to two month, which sounded so shady, bc thats now what their websites says and thats not what we have been told. We asked the advisor to cc the financial department of give us their phone number, they did not get back to us.  


The other day, we have found that the schools accreditation is no longer valid with USCIS and other departments and therefore they are closing down, and laid off all teachers.   


I doubt that they will give our money back. My question to you all is: 

1) which department should I contact in order to get our money back (forgot to mention above that, the school is in NYC)  


2) Since the payment was done by my credit card back in December 20th, 2019, can I call my credit card company and have it dismissed? It is possible?

foekl5,peachblossomcotton,"First car purchase wanting to go about insurance options, advice really needed.","Hi everyone, I will be purchasing my first car later this week. I am an AZ resident and the car is going to be a 2019 Ford Fusion Hybrid. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with not only insurance premiums, but also with specifically Auto-Owners Insurance. I am specifically very interested in paying for services with this company, especially with auto insurance and renters insurance. 

I know that AZ by law requires minimum coverage, but my spouse and I really want absolute full-coverage and are willing to pay for it. We are looking to pay bi-annually(six months) or annually(full-year) at a time. Would this generally mean a discounted rate?

We are also students with a 3.0+ average and I know that Auto-Owners offers discounts for good students, no accidents, no tickets, good driving history, bundle insurance, and everything that we qualify for. Do you think that this would be multiple discounts, or would we have to choose one discount? 

I also wanted to know how much it would be 6 months or 1 year rate for Full Coverage on:

\-Comprehensive

\-GAP 

\-Medical/Funeral Services

\-Rental Reimbursement 

\-Roadside Assistance

\-Uninsured Motorist Bodily Damage

I know I should talk to an agent and I am in a few days before I purchase the vehicle from Enterprise, I just wanted to know what YOU think about coverage, experience with Auto-Owners, and if I am missing any other insurance policy we should pay for in addition that is needed to ensure we are the most protected. 

Also, if anyone knows of any additional warranty for our car purchase: 

We have a 30,000/1 year warranty coming with the car. 

If you have any additional suggestions, please feel free to freely speak your mind and voice up. I absolutely am open to any useful information and advice, I'm just a college student finally able to purchase my first car within my financial means and better my future. I do not have anyone else I could ask this kind of advice too.

I’m just ready to move on from this nightmare he has a four bedroom house and kept 2 cars also is legally enlisted on child support and doesn’t pay. So I see this bill and called collections and told me it’s from a hospital visit? I called the hospital to find out my kids father was the one responsible for this but because our daughter is both our responsibility (I agree) it’s Also charged under me!?! 
He signed all of the documents stating he would be responsible for this bill. 
If he doesn’t pay child support he is not going to pay for this medical bill! 
When I spoke to him about it he told me to pay for it since I want it off my credit. He’s not responsible for anything and it’s really frustrating. The collection agency is not understanding with my situation all they want is the money. Also I don’t think I should be charged because I do have Medi-Cal insurance so if I would have taken my daughter into the emergency room it would have been covered and I wouldn’t be going through this because I can’t afford medical bills since I am on welfare.

Current job:
- financial lending industry
- working at home but there is not much work to do at all. I pretty much login and wait for work if there is any. I feel expendable if there is a cut.
- big team 
- I started with them 1.5 year ago as the only external hire on the team. Mostly everyone has seniority over me.

New job:
- financial investment company 
- will be able to work from home. Recruiter said they have hired employees that are on boarding there remotely right now.
- pay raise and title raise but it’s a 12 month contract to cover for maternity
- lean team so I should have more work
- great asset for my resume 

The kicker is I work for offline marketing in my current job which is risky as lockdown is restricting traffic to our physical stores so there’s even less work than normal. On the flip side, my new job will be online marketing but for the recruitment department... Although there is brand building and long term goals of recruitment marketing, this is worrying to me. They have not retracted my offer or any other offers they have currently despite the economic climate.

So my questions are: is it possible for my fiancé to stop working and still remain on her employers health insurance? If she can’t, then how can she continue her coverage if she quits? (COBRA, ACA, etc.) Is it possible to add her to my insurance even though we aren’t married (we do live together) and have her covered within the next month or so in time for the delivery? Is there a way that she can take a super early maternity leave and start collecting disability roughly 12 weeks before her due date? Or, is there any way she could start taking unpaid leave? 

Sorry I have so many questions and thanks in advance to anyone kind enough to help. 

tl;dr: my pregnant fiancé wants to stop working 3 months before her due date because of coronavirus but needs to stay on her employers health insurance: help!",8,1585087312,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foe738/how_can_my_pregnant_fiancé_quit_working_and_stay/,personalfinance,1
foe6v9,Xainesdemise,Unsure how to proceed,"I have a credit card debt that is about to start accruing interest. Sadly I was unable to pay it off on my own so I took a debt consolidation loan to umbrella all my credit card debt. It dropped my monthly payments and also dropped the total amount I am going to end up owning.

However I just checked the card in question to make sure it was paid off and it still isn't paid. When the check was mailed the company wouldn't give us a clear mailing address so the bank mailed it to the address listed on their payments page.

I called the cardholder company today to inquire if the payment was in processing or if it had been returned to sender. The person on the phone told me that the address we mailed it to is the wrong address, still didn't give me the correct address, and stated the check would have been voided by them and not returned.

Due to COVID-19 the bank I received the loan through isn't allowing walk-in customers and I dont know if I can get a new check sent out now and I am at a loss for what to do.",4,1585087292,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foe6v9/unsure_how_to_proceed/,personalfinance,1

My partner recently got a job as a subcontractor doing sales work for a company in Holland (we live in the US). She is getting paid in Euros and we are struggling to find the easiest method for getting a check deposited into our personal accounts. We have checking accounts at a local credit union, which told us that they cannot receive international deposits as they do not have a swift #. We also have an online savings account through Ally.

Right now, I'm not sure if she needs to open an account at a bank in Holland or anywhere else in Europe to receive her check and then transfer to a domestic account, or if there is a way to go directly to a domestic account. We are obviously looking to minimize currency exchange fees, wire transfer fees, things of that nature.

What do I do?,"So, as the title says, I have multiple private student loans across multiple lenders. The total adds up to around $90,000. The issue is I am paying very high amounts for a couple of them resulting in a large monthly payment for just loans.

I am currently paying $530, $497, $140, and $130 to different loan companies a month. The largest of which was a bad loan bought out after I had defaulted a year or so ago. I only make around $1800 a month with almost $1500 in student loans, I can barely afford to pay rent, let alone eat or buy necessities. 

I have attempted to refinance a few of them together to drop the total monthly payment but I don't  have great credit (\~600) and neither do any of my family members. I am running out of options. I've considered bankruptcy but I'm concerned that my girlfriend (who is my cosigner for my defaulted refinance loan) will be effected.

Currently my credit is only affected by high utilization, so the interest rate is only about 7% lower. (17.99% vs 22.4% on the credit cards) My main objective was to get aggressive about paying the debt down and boost my credit score quickly as early motivation.

I am an essential employee at my primary job (even if things get worse, so if I am ever laid off we all will have much bigger fish to fry.) That being said I fear the aggressive payments on the pay off loan will be too aggressive in about 3 months if we don’t resume  normal life. I was about two clicks away from signing the forms and I got cold feet and ran the numbers again. Should I withdraw my application till things settle? Will interest rates be lower in a few months or will lenders be hesitant to lend? I also wonder if there might be some incoming debt relief that I should hold out for.

It probably holds no bearing, but I have other bank accounts with no activity too and they didn't do this.

I did ask explain the situation to them and they said no there is nothing they can do about it, and also said no supervisor is available (the wait times for calls are very long due to the pandemic so maybe that's a valid excuse?)

Is there any suggestion for how I can get them to activate it over the phone or fax?

fod673,GeoSoccer,750 more in rent to live alone worth it?,"Hi,

Im currently living in a rented accommodation, I originally moved in here with my friend who moved out over 2 years ago. Since then I've been living with my current room mate who I get along with fine, although at the start it was awkward enough (I'm very introverted and like to keep to myself). He's now planning to move out next month.

I earn 3151 euro after tax a month and the rent is 1500 euro, bills about roughly 160 (all split by two)

I'm contemplating just living alone in the apartment but not sure if i have enough income to do so,  i would have roughly 1500 euro disposable income for the month if i decided to do it vs about 2320 now.

Over the past few months I've been working towards getting a promotion at the company I've worked at for ~2 years.

With just my luck, I was offered the promotion that I have been working towards with the stipulation that I won't get any sort of raise right now. I'm kind of at a loss right now in terms of whether to accept the offer or wait for this all to blow over.

I asked about potentially getting something in writing regarding an increase in compensation once the freeze has been lifted, but was told that was unlikely as there's no time frame as to when that will happen.

I spoke with someone at turbotax live, and...well, I think I understood more than she did. I'm fairly certain I know what I'm supposed to do, but not being a tax professional, and the IRS publications are basically a foreign language to me, I basically just want to be sure. 

So my question really is - how do I go about finding someone who can help me with this? I was hoping turbotax live with their advertisements for connecting with CPAs would do the trick, but I told her what the publication said, not the other way around, so I'm still not convinced. My family has never used a CPA or tax prep service so I essentially am just hoping to not get screwed when all I need is some guidance. I just want to make sure I'm getting the best information. Perfectly willing to pay, just dont want to pay an arm and a leg for an otherwise easy return (seriously - normally takes me 10 minutes to file). I can obviously call around, but I'm just not sure what I should be checking to make sure I find someone right for me.

Thanks for any advice, and in case anyone is interested, my tax issue below:

Essentially - I was in grad school 2017-2019. I think I miffed up because it was not clear in the past and at the time I thought I was doing it right, but my Spring 2018 &amp; 2019 semesters were paid in Spring 2018 &amp; 2019, but since they were billed in the prior year, the charges were on the prior year 1098-T. So my Spring 2019 charges were included on my 2018 tax return. My 2019 1098-T does not have any charges, just my scholarships. In 2018 alone, without the 2019 charges, I would still have been eligible to get the lifetime learning credit. I'm hoping, that if I amend my 2018 return, and remove those charges, I can attach my student account activity to this years return showing that I paid my 2019 charges in 2019, and claim those charges on my 2019 tax return in order to get the lifetime learning credit.",2,1585082519,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/focqyo/finding_help_with_a_tax_return/,personalfinance,1

So, the IRS has this online calculator where I entered all of my information and it estimates my return. Supposedly it’s more accurate. It has this slider bar to adjust the amount of my refund (unfortunately, it’s not as granular as I would like).

foc9hs,KairosRyan,Is the AMEX blue cash card a charge card? Should I apply for it?," 

I saw somewhere that the AMEX Blue Cash everyday was a Charge card. From my understanding a charge card is a credit card that doesn't have a very strict hard limit to your credit line, and needs to be paid in full at the end of every month. Is the AMEX blue cash card a charge card?

Also, currently I am 18 and have been for 5 months. I have 2 credit cards, the BOFA cash rewards card, and the Discover IT student card. Due to my negligence, I had thought that hard inquiries stay visible on your credit report for only 2 months.... Because of this, I currently have 4 hard inquiries in total. From what I understand, anyone who has 5 hard inquiries in 24 months is seen as a riskier borrower right? My goal currently is to improve my credit score as fast as possible (712 transunion and 709 Equifax). I thought the higher total credit limit I have the easier it would be to stay under 2% credit utilization, because of this I was attempting to get more credit cards.

What would be the best thing for me to do right now? Apply for another card and get the 5th inquiry and wait for 2 years? If so then what card would you recommend? I was thinking of the Blue Cash everyday card because if it is a charge card, then I wont have to worry as much about staying under 2% credit utilization with that card. Also are my approval odds fair or good? Thank you!

Note: I am not someone who goes overspending as soon as I get a new card. I only buy things if I already have enough money to pay for it.",13,1585080944,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/foc9hs/is_the_amex_blue_cash_card_a_charge_card_should_i/,personalfinance,1

My husband and I consolidated our debt to a 0% interest card this year.  The balance is a little over 7k and due in September.  The original payback plan was to utilize our rental income this year + my bonus to pay off this debt.

Well, of course, our furnace and hot water heater broke at the rental property this year, so the savings there went to fix that issue.  Now with the pandemic, I took a 25% pay cut. And our tenant stopped paying her rent and we have a no-eviction situation in place in the state that property is in. 

I still received my bonus ($7500 net).  Should we use that to pay off the entirety of the debt, or keep it liquid? Can we do a second balance transfer on the card to another one to postpone the time frame the payment is due?

So is it up to my lender to let me get a lower rate now that they would be back closer to what I was preapproved for?  Or they going to obviously not promote me do this to obviously put more money in their pockets?

fobbx2,WhiteJamesBrown,"I now own a house, but mortgage &amp; homeowner's insurance are still under my recently deceased mother's name. How do I get a homeowner's policy while keeping the mortgage under her name?"," 

X-post from r/RealEstate, hope that's allowed and sorry in advance for long post.

So, my mother recently passed in November.  4.5 years ago she quit-claimed her house to me and so I am on the deed, and considered the owner, but I am not on the mortgage / loan.  There were no other assets, and so there is no estate. I will be keeping the house, and renting it out, which I've already done.  I would like to keep paying the mortgage, and just continue as things are right now.  The estate lawyer that was ""helping me"" (but really did not help me much and I've done everything on my own) strongly suggested that I do it this way, to prevent having to refinance. (This is not a sketchy lawyer btw, it's just in Rhode Island, where everything is a little sketchy).

The reason I would prefer not to refinance, aside from costs, is because I just bought my own house and I'm not sure how a refi would work with my current debt to income ratio.  I have had other people tell me, brokers and real estate agents, to do it this way too to save the headache of going through this process. I do realize I could refinance this as a rental property at a slightly higher interest rate with proof of current tenants, and my debt to income ratio wouldn't be an issue. I'm saving that as a last resort.

I'm now realizing that if anything ever happens and there is a claim on the homeowner's insurance, likely they will be able to not pay out because I am not on the policy. So essentially I'm paying a policy right now that covers nothing. Currently, the policy is rolled into the monthly mortgage payment.

So, I believe the solution to this, outside of notifying the bank and the refinancing, would be to somehow get a homeowner's policy in my own name on the house. I spoke to my own insurance agent on my (not my mom's) house, and pretty much gave him the rundown, and he said that likely the insurance company will notify the bank if I tell them the circumstances of why I'm opening a new policy under my own name.

What do people do in this situation?  Everyone keeps telling me that this is a thing that people do, but I cannot find anything at all on the internet on this particular type of situation. 

I guess what I'm asking is:

1. How can I have insurance on this house, without refinancing under my own name? 
2. If my only option to refinance, can they deny me based on income / debt ratio? Or would they just hose me on an interest rate?",15,1585077946,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fobbx2/i_now_own_a_house_but_mortgage_homeowners/,personalfinance,1

This week i'll be receiving my bonus of 10K and I have been thinking of 3 scenarios in which i would invest it. Backstory. I have 6 months in an emergency fund.

1. Use 6k to max out my Target Date Fund ROTH at the discount prices due to the fluctuating market and use the remainder to buy DIS Stock, which i already have a footprint in. 
2. Use 6k to max out my Target Date Fund Roth and use the remainder to max out my HSP for 2019 and the remainder on my HSP for 2020.

I'm leaning towards 1. because with the Tax date moving im assuming i will get those extra months to max out my HSP for 2019, and id rather not pass up on the opportunity  to buy DIS stocks at a discount price.

My father shared some info re: his 401k with me, hoping you all may be able to help me evaluate if there's anything we can do.

He has a 401k with a previous employer, and that employer is changing 401k providers amidst the crash. He's lost 30% value since January, and is frustrated that via the provider shift, he's effectively selling his shares and repurchasing.

My knee jerk reaction is that it's a bad deal for him, while I also feel like it could go either way, depending on how the markets behave during transfer.

What does he have to be worried about, and are their actions he can take to try to ensure he at least breaks even?

foaa75,GRBDad,Retirement account question,"I have a question for those of you more astute about retirement investing that I can claim to be. I'm currently 49 and looking to retire in the vicinity of 60 barring something unexpected. I've gone the lazy route with my IRA and 401k accounts in recent years and have them in Target Retirement Date funds. The majority of this is through Vanguard.

Knowing the market is down 30ish percent, I'd love to have available cash to put into the market now for long terms gains down the road. However, I really don't. The cash I have is emergency fund style and will stay that way. It occurred to me last night that I should look at the portfolio balance in my target funds. I'm sure this is skewed due to the equity losses of late but as of now it's roughly 75% equities and 25% bonds.

Other than the inherent risk or volatility that comes with equities, is there a reason I wouldn't want to transfer my money from the target date funds into something like a mix including a 500 index fund, a russell 2000 index fund, etc? Basically, the intent being to move money out of the bond funds I'm currently holding within the Target Date accounts and get that money into stock funds. I'll add that I realize we may not have bottomed out in the market yet but I'm not really intent on trying to time the market. (For what it's worth, I tend to think it's still going to go down more than up for a bit yet as more Coronavirus measures are still being implemented across the country despite the big gains so far today as I post this message.)

fo9kmb,281threethreeoh8004,Question on paying down debts and requesting emergency forbearance from federal student loan,"Hey everyone,

This morning I had a thought to hopefully get us a little ahead during this time of uncertainty, and take advantage of the 0.0% interest and emergency forbearance on federal student loans. The idea revolves completely around the idea of paying down interest-bearing debt first. Here's a quick breakdown:

My federal student loan: $15,000 @ 3.91% (temporarily 0.0%); paying $230/mo  
Wife's federal student loan: $4,430 @ higher standard rate (temporarily 0.0%); paying $95/mo  
Wife's car: $15,300 @ 3.39%; paying $360/mo

I can't confirm my wife's interest rate on her student loan, but I know it's some amount higher than my own rate. My thought here is to request forbearance through MyFedLoan on my loan of $15,000, and then rolling my $230/mo into our car payment, effectively paying almost $600/mo for as long as this lasts. In doing so, we'd be paying it down at a rate that would satisfy the debt in just over 24 months. If forbearance lasts only 12 months, that's still an additional $2,760 we'd be putting toward the car, on top of the assumed $4,320 during that same span.

Here's the MyFedLoan response to COVID-19:  [https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid)   
My main question is whether they would capitalize unpaid interest (interest that would have been accrued during this period of 0.0%) once it's lifted? The only thing they say is that unpaid interest currently on the account will not be capitalized. I'm still planning on making my next payment at the beginning of April to bring my balance under $15,000, and clear any interest currently due.

Good idea? My concern is taking some kind of action like this in order to get ahead a little bit, and then it somehow come back to bite us when we're fine operating as normal.",6,1585072427,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo9kmb/question_on_paying_down_debts_and_requesting/,personalfinance,1

Getting even more complicated, why is there always a buyer or selling to purchase from? I have never had to wait more than a couple seconds to purchase or sell stocks.",23,1585072296,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo9j71/general_question_about_stocks/,personalfinance,1
fo9j2j,This_Is_The_Way_,Is buying a NYC condo right now a bad idea?,"I’m looking to buy a condo with cash in NYC that I slowly and painfully saved up and also borrowed. 

I’ve been looking for awhile now and had a unit slip through my fingers last month because I didn’t offer the full amount. Someone went over the ask price by tens of thousands.

Earlier this month a unit went on the market in the same building so I was already familiar and I’m looking to go under contract now but I should wait for a market price correction? 

But... Moving forward, anyone have tips on buying it with a price reduction and how to go about it? 

Here’s the situation:

In this current environment with COVID and mortgage rates going up a bit and the general confusion in the finance world, I feel like I have the upper hand as the market will become a buyers market. The seller is older and lives in out of state. (There’s a storage space that’s included which I thought was deeded to the unit.... which I can use as a means for price reduction)

On the other, the seller broker knows I want the place and has mentioned there’s other buyers (which I feel like he’s BSing). I really want that place and don’t want to lose out again. 

Any help is really appreciated! Thanks!",4,1585072287,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo9j2j/is_buying_a_nyc_condo_right_now_a_bad_idea/,personalfinance,1

So I just got hit with a collection notice for an apartment my roommates I had a short term lease on last year in Texas.  Apparently there was a final water/utility bill that didn't get included with Rent, like it normally did.  So we thought we paid off our rent when we moved out, but apparently there was a $400 charge that was added much later.  This would not have been an issue, had they contacted us, which they did not.

I just got a letter on the mail saying I owed around $400 from a debt collection company.  I called the apartment complex to figure out what was going on, and discovered that there was that final bill none of us knew about that didn't get paid.  

I fully intend to call the collection company and pay it off, but before I do so, is there any way I can avoid a hit on my credit report, or anything I should know to ask for to cover my ass before I pay off the bill?",3,1585072008,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo9g09/how_to_handle_a_surprise_collection_notice/,personalfinance,1

fo8dip,coolityoutwigheads,Supposed to close on a house in 7 days. Down to one income. Sort of panicking about potential loss of home value.,"We’re first time US homebuyers who need to be out of our current rental by August. After hemming and hawing for a few years on whether or not to stay local, we finally found a house that should be great for us for the next few years. It’s pretty much move-in ready with potential projects with which we can impart preferences. 

HOWEVER, we’ve been COVID-19ed down to only my income, which is thankfully still enough to afford it and take care of the two of us plus our infant. Without any idea when my partner’s income is going to get back on line, the thought of home ownership is stressful. (I’m pretty confident in my income staying where it is.)

As alluded to above, this is not our forever home, and if we decide to have another child, we’ll be bursting at the seams already. We’re afraid that if we go through with the purchase, we’ll have grossly overpaid by time economies start to resemble normal and we’ve returned to a dual-income household. It’s partly anticipating FOMO on a buyer’s market in the near future, but it’s partly, “How irresponsible is it to jump into this major purchase with all the uncertainty?”

It’s a good neighborhood near downtown Orlando, FL, with good, not great schools,a cool vision plan for growth on the nearby commercial corridor, etc. We overpaid a bit, but that’s the way the market was here a month ago...

fo8b17,huh-why,Department of Revenue threatening lien against my father - need some advice please!,"Long story short, my father has been getting calls from the Department of Revenue since August of last year demanding a $3,000 payment on taxes he owes. He thought these phone calls were scams because they refused to give any information about why he owes any money (he doesn't speak much English) so he began blocking the calls. I even thought it was a scam because the person on the other line seemed extremely shady and it was very similar to other fake phone calls my whole family has been getting for years.

A few days ago, we get an official letter from the Department of Revenue threatening to file a lien unless he pays $4,000 (they added interest and penalties).

I have a few questions about this:

fo89re,JeremyEck,"“Some debts are fun when you are acquiring them, but none are fun when you set about retiring them.” -Ogden Nash","Frugalosophy: A Financial Philosophy
The origins of Frugalosophy date back to when I applied for my first credit card the day I turned 18 years old. Growing up with little extra money for lifes indulges I used that card for everything I couldn't buy. After graduation from college, I found myself with over $10,000 in credit card debt. I began developing a set of tenets that I would live by to avoid falling into indebtment ever again.

After graduation from medical school, I sat down one sunny Miami weekend in December and started writing down everything I've done to ensure I didn't fall into debt. Words like side-gigs, saving and investing didn't accurately portray what I wanted to convey. So, I used words like scavenging to replace side-gigs; hoarding to replace saving; plundering to replace investing.

Frugalosophy is a set of six tenets to help guide your financial decisions. You will be able to avoid indebtment and create financial security. Frugalosophy is a way of living; not just advice, helpful tips or a way to live minimally.

fo8977,moshjeier,What to do with my RSUs,"Hey all, I'm looking for some advice since my wife and I are in disagreement on this. I had a batch of RSUs vest this week that I had originally been planning to sell off to pay off a loan. These RSUs would have been valued at about 100k before the market tanked. After the tank they lost about 40% of their value so I was planning to hold on to them for a while.

Today the market has popped a bit and I'm back to being ""only"" down 20% and the trading window for these RSUs close at the end of the week and won't open again for 3 months.   


We have about 50k cash on hand right now and given the current situation I wouldn't mind having some more cash on hand. My paycheck is safe so I'll continue to get paid moving forward, we do have some debt in low-interest loans but nothing particularly worrying. The RSUs are worth 80k as of today.

When I was 19 my mom financed my car under her name as I didn’t have any credit at the time and would’ve have been approved.

fo7j9z,URMsusiepremed,"24 y/o pre-medical student in desperate need of financial advice (budgeting, debt repayment, savings, investing)","Good morning everyone, I hope you're all doing well and staying sane during such uncertain times. This is lengthy post but I tried to categorize the major points as best as possible. 

A little bit about me

I am very embarrassed admitting all of this but it's about time I address it.  I am a single (no dependents) first generation 24F with very little knowledge in anything regarding personal finances, it stresses me out so much to the point that I’ve avoided it at all costs. I am fortunate in that I have very supportive parents however, I was never really taught anything regarding debt repayment, saving, building credit, and investing. I have been trying to teach myself these past few years but I still feel a bit lost. My parents are by no means wealthy but they were able to pay for a substantial portion of my college tuition and have allowed me to live at home rent-free after graduating. I graduated college in 2018 with a BA in Psychology and since then I’ve been working about 35 hours per week as well as completing a few prerequisite courses I need in order to apply to medical school next year and hopefully begin in the summer of 2022. 

My current financial situation 

I only have a Chase College Checking Account with a debit card that I use for pretty much everything. I have no savings account and no credit card. 

Income: I began my first real job out of college in September 2019. I get paid a laughable $15/hour averaging at about $900 biweekly after taxes which gets directly deposited into my checking account. As of today, I have about $5,900 in my account and that’s all the money I have to my name. I have been out of work for 3 days now due to COVID-19  (from my understanding those days will be paid sick leave but that still to be determined) but it’s possible I will be called in to go back any day. 

Debts: As of today, my largest debt is $28,301 in undergraduate student loans, all of which are federal nelnet-serviced, half are subsidized and the other half are unsubsidized. $1325 of that loan is from interest from the past 6 years with the highest interest rate being 4.66%  I have been in a grace period since I graduated in 2018 because I am still considered a student since I am still taking classes. I have not paid anything towards my student loans. I also recently purchased a used car because my last one (which was completely paid off) had a transmission failure not covered by warranty. I was able to get a good deal on a car that I love but I am left with $10,500 to pay. My mother (who is an actual angel) is giving me a personal loan to cover the 10,500 without interest but I promised her I would begin paying her back on a monthly basis beginning in April once I figure out what my work schedule will look like. 

Expenses: I buy most of my own food, pay for my own gas, any car maintenance expenses, my copays at the doctor's office and contact lenses and any misc. purchases I make with my own money. I would like to learn how to budget my money. I don’t consider myself a frivolous spender but I do think I spend a bit too much money on food. I don’t really go out to eat but I try to eat organic foods which are typically expensive. I’m still under my mothers health insurance plan (and intend to be on it for the next 2 years). I do not pay my cell-phone bill or my car insurance. No rent, no utilities. My mom isn’t pressuring me to pay anything but I want to stop feeling like a mooch. 

Credit: As of today my credit score is 755, most of which is from the student loan. It been higher than 755 but several car dealerships I visited ran my credit 4 times. In the fall of last year, my mother used a credit card under my name to pay for my grandfather's funeral expenses but that has since been completely paid off and that account has been closed.  

Investments: I have about $400 I’m playing with in stocks with Ally Invest.  That money was a gift to me from a family member that has been urging me to take an interest in stock investment. Although I am interested in investing my money, my desire to learn about the stock market is minimal. I am open to hearing other ideas on making my money work for me. 

My plan: From what I’ve read, I think my first priority should be paying off the interest on my student loans and then chip away at the principal but I’m just not sure how much I should aim to pay off each month. I promised my mother I would pay her at least $200 monthly for the car and I want to begin paying for my cell-phone bill and then eventually my car insurance as well. ANY BUDGETING RESOURCES WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!! 

My second priority is to open a savings account with a high APY. I was considering Ally last year when the rate was in the 2.1% range but now it seems like no bank is going above 1.75%. I am still considering Ally (1.5%, 0 minimum balance) or  CIT (1.75% w/ a monthly deposit of $100 or more or maintain a minimum balance of $25,000) or Marcus by Goldman Sachs (1.75% 0 minimum balance). Any other recommendations? And how much of my income should I aim to put towards savings? 

My third priority is to start building credit that isn’t just tied to my student loans. I’ve been researching and I think I might want to opt for the Chase Freedom Unlimited cc and only use it for things I know I can pay for (Spotify, gas, groceries, ezpass) and use the auto-pay feature to ensure I’m never late on a payment. Then next year when I begin applying to medical schools and have all the testing/application fees and travel expenses that come with it, I will open up a Chase Sapphire Preferred to take advantage of travel perks. 

My final priority is to invest what little money I may have left over. Since I have no interest in stocks, what other recommendations do you guys have? Or any suggestions on how to become more interested in stock investment? Or should I use that money for an emergency fund? 

Again, I want to emphasize how embarrassed I am not only on how financially dependent on my parents. I am incredibly grateful for the fairly privileged life I’ve lived but I’m trying to make the necessary changes to become an independent adult. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read. I look forward to hearing all your responses and advice!

TLDR; post grad pre-med student to start medical school in 2022, no savings no cc only checking account with \~$6,000 to my name, $28,000 undergrad debt, only major monthly expenses are car payment and food, need advice on how to budget,  debt repayment (how much to pay off monthly), savings (which bank and how much to put towards it), building credit and investing.",23,1585065682,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo7j9z/24_yo_premedical_student_in_desperate_need_of/,personalfinance,1

Then at the end of last year we both officially moved and got jobs in South Carolina.

I started with trying to do our taxes jointly through Credit Karma, and I noticed that being a student seems to count as having worked in another state. But if I say I've worked in multiple states I'm told they can't do my state taxes, only federal. If this is all correct, where can I use this year? Or should we just say we've only lived and worked in South Carolina since that's the only state we had any income from last year?

Thank you all in advance. I can provide more information as requested.",10,1585065420,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo7ggh/wherehow_can_my_wife_and_i_file_our_state_taxes/,personalfinance,1

I’m currently in my second year of doing my own taxes (I’m 18!) and I was little confused on what to do this year!

So last year I did my taxes, but I didn’t owe anything, but I got a refund back. This year I did my taxes and I owed money, which was expected since I started college and financial aid department walked me through everything! 

So basically I owed $232 to my home state and $1 to the state where I go to school (I also worked there too). I filed with TurboTax and they said I would get a refund of $133, but everything has processed and now it says I owe $100. I’m wondering is it normal for TurboTax/IRS to take your refund and apply it to your owed taxes? I’m also confused on how to pay my taxes, do I pay through the IRS on their website? Or do I go through my home state and pay taxes through their website?

2. General Brokeage account- This is what I would like the advice on the most, I plan to buy a house in the next 6/7 years and would like to put around $5000 of my savings into the Vanguard sp500 fund VFIAX

I know that you are not supposed to time the market and that nothing is guaranteed, I am a complete beginner in the stock market but with how low everything is right now it seems like It would be a worthwhile investment to invest in the VFIAX fund for money that I will need before retirement.

My goal is to save up for a house and thats why I would like to put money in a general brokerage account before I max out my roth (I will eventually get to the point where I am maxing it out each year as I get pay increases)

So, long story short, my mom lives with me. I have a secure job atm, where I earn around $50k/ year in a low cost of living area (Vermont). She doesn’t work, and her physical and mental health are deteriorating. 

She earns about $1200/mo in social security. I own the house. She pays me about $400/mo that goes towards the mortgage which is $850. I pay everything else- internet, electric, oil, house maintenance and so on. 

Now, she has always had EXTREMELY poor financial carelessness. She has no money left over at the end of the month due to the above. I’ve tried reasoning with her by offering guidance over the past year or so, but she is incapable of changing. She has other bills that she has to pay such as credit card payments, cell phone, food, gas, etc. I’ve gone over a budget with her (too many times) and she should have around $100/mo left over. 

Are there any state/ government programs that can financially assist me with anything?

My monthly budget looks like this:
Student Loans: $1400 (out of a $115,000 loan)
Rent: $1000
Transportation: $100 (still driving my parents car, I just pay gas)
Food $400
Misc/Entertainment: $400
Roth IRA: $500
(This is all post-tax, and after I maxed out my 401k contributions and Roth IRA contributions)
.
After these expenses, I still have $2000 left over to save. I don't want to put more towards my student loans because my workplace is helping pay those loans off via monthly payments for the next 6 years. If I pay the loan off quicker, that's money I'd lose out on from my workplace's future payments.
.
1.) How should I prioritize saving this $2000? I figure I should  start an emergency savings. But I'm not sure how much per month to put into an emergency fund
2.) After my emergency fund, should I invest in stocks? Or is there a better place for my money? 
3.) Is it worth it to pay off my loans in 3 years instead of 6? (I'll end up paying $10k extra to do this as a result of losing 3 years of employer contributions), but is it worth it just to not have loans hanging over my head? 
4.) When I turn 50, I'll also get a $40,000/year pension. With that, social security, and my maxed out 401k and roth ira, I imagine I'll have plenty to retire. Should I even bother saving up this extra money, or do you think I should have fun with it since I'm young and have energy to go do stuff?

With the onset of COVID-19 in the US, my parents are panicking and want to gift me 18k towards my upcoming wedding in case, God forbid, something happens to them. 

Their plan is to gift me 15K and my partner 3K. I read online that the gift tax only comes into play about 15k per individual. 

If my parents follow through on this plan, am I correct that...

1) There will be no gift tax

2) Gifting me 15k and my partner 3k is legal

3) We do not have to file anything special with the bank or IRS

4) Massachusetts doesn't have any weird negations of the federal gift tax

My husband and I have lived in a house for the last 4 years that has both my father in law and my husband on the deed. My father in law flips houses, this being one of them. There is no mortgage on the house (last assessed at 250k) but there is a 150k HELOC in my father in laws name that my husband pays monthly (this arrangement happened prior to us being married). We weren’t in any rush to refinance but now with everything happening my father in law is pushing to have us refinance into a mortgage so he is no longer liable for the balance. 

We work in healthcare so I feel fine doing this now as income loss doesn’t seem to be an issue at this point.

fo62ro,pojomojo6159,529 Plan - Advice needed!,"Hello everyone,

I am thinking about opening two 529 plans, one for my child (2 years old) and one for my niece (11 years old). I have a reliable source of income for the foreseeable future that will allow me to make regular contributions into both accounts. In addition, with the market being low vs several months ago, it seems like a good time to start. 

For me personally, I have an emergency fund saved of 6 months of expenses and regularly contribute to my 401k at 8%. So I am comfortable with additional contributions to these 529 accounts based on my income/savings. 


My questions:
1. What is the best 529 plan platform to utilize?
2. Are there any disadvantages or alternatives to 529s I should know about?
3. Any other items I should consider?

The first time it was $550.   We were told that next year it would be much cheaper, as all our documents and whatnot are already entered and the consecutive price per document was less.

This year, it was $500, and none of that was true.  I was shocked they charged $45 for the child credit and $10 per stock sale.  I'm angry about that because I trade commission free.  I'm thinking we need a new arrangement.  We have

3 W2s filing joint
2 mortgages / interest statements
A student loan
One child (wont qualify next year)
A stock portfolio of 7 positions
A single rental property

fo5l60,throwaway92819102,"My Dad created a PayPal credit account in my name, racked it up to over $2k and refused to pay it off. What should I do?","My Dad has always had bad credit and has been horrible with money ever since I can remember. A few years ago, he came to me and admitted that he was on the computer applying for credit from PayPal and inadvertently used my email to sign up, and was approved for the account with the use in my name. He apologized and swore to me up and down that whatever was used on that account was going to be paid in full each month. Being a naive 20 year old, I wasn't happy about it but I already had a good credit score so I didn't think it would matter much.

For the first 6 months he made payments in full and on time, but did not on the 7th month. He called PayPal to try to fix this, and the representative then told him that PayPal credit does not report to the credit union. Oh boy.

As soon as he found that out, he spent all of the money in the account to the absolute max, over 2 thousand dollars, and ducked payments. The company rang my phone all day and all night for months, and I begged him to just pay it off, but he refused saying ""I'll pay it when I can and I can't right now. We needed that money. Don't worry, they don't report to the credit union.""

After I finally convinced the representatives to only call his phone, the phone calls and emails stopped, and I honestly forgot about it for awhile. However a few days ago I got a letter in the mail from a collections agency, stating that this was my final notice to begin making payments before a civil lawsuit is filed. I also checked my credit report, and not surprisingly, the record of the debt being transferred to a collections agency was there. 

This has ruined my credit. I am 24 years old and finishing my master's degree in May, I cannot have this on my report. I spoke with my Dad and it took a lot of explaining that they DID report to the credit union (he was still convinced that this would NEVER show up on my credit report) and he agreed to start making monthly payments on the account. 

I filed a dispute with Credit Karma and I am waiting to hear back. I know I should probably file a police report to get this off of my credit history, but I do live with my parents for the time being and that makes things a lot more difficult. I will do so if I have to, but what kind of trouble will this bring him?

I am in a kind of rough spot. I am in NY, and three weeks ago I accepted a new job and put in my notice. My new job opted to do my new job paperwork on my first day (which was supposed to be Thursday.) However, I got notice last Friday that they do not have anything that I can do remotely (it's a grad student learning position at a public library -- civil service, but kind of like a paid internship) so they have indefinitely deferred my start date. They still want me: she emailed the paperwork, it just can't be processed because it needs to go through local government, which is closed. I immediately called my boss to see if I could rescind my resignation, and she went to bat for me to HR (who ultimately said no yesterday.) I have also reached out to my union rep to see if they can do anything. They are looking into it, but I'm not holding my breath. 

I have an emergency fund and my vacation time is getting paid out, so my immediate needs are going to be met. I have a roof over my head, my girlfriend still has a job, and we have food in the house. My bills are pretty minimal. However, with things being so uncertain, I don't know when I'll be able to start my new job. My resources are not infinite, and I'm not even sure if I'm eligible for unemployment. I could barely even get onto the NYS unemployment website to try to go through their FAQs to figure it out.

fo5e1q,OLinePride93,Enterprise False Damage Claim,"Hi PF,

My car was recently rear ended, and I had it repaired. The other guys insurance paid for a rental car for me while my car was in the shop being repaired. The car rental was through Enterprise. Enterprise delivered the car to the repair shop, and there was extensive damage to the front bumper, it was misaligned, falling off, as if someone drove it over a curb. I told the renting agent to note the damage, and she did and took pictures. 

I had the car for two days, and the repair shop has a deal with Enterprise where you drop off the car there, and they take care of the rest. I wanted to make sure there would be no BS related to the bumper, so I called the Enterprise location to see if someone could come out to do a final walk around with me and close out my rental. The person on the phone said all the car damage is notated, and it will not be any problem, and no one needs to come out. I figured everything is okay, and left my keys at the repair shop.

Fast forward to yesterday, I get a call from Enterprise saying there is damage on the bumper, and damage on the wheel well and they want to pin it on me. Un-fucking-believable. I called the branch back, told them all the damage is pre existing, that I specifically called to make sure it would be okay, and that its unreal of them to try to blame it on me after renting me a damaged car. They said that they don't care about the bumper damage, but damage in the wheel well... which was clearly caused by whoever destroyed the bumper. Additionally, how was I supposed to see wheel well damage on my walk around if its behind the wheel, am I supposed to raise the car on jacks now? 

The branch agent asked if I can come in to file a ""change of condition form"", which I refused arguing that there is no change of condition, they got the car the same way I received it. He said if I want to dispute the damage, I can come in and fill out some other dispute form.

I'm not sure of how to proceed, this is DISGUSTING business practice, and I hope they rot, but what should my next steps be?",4,1585057702,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo5e1q/enterprise_false_damage_claim/,personalfinance,1

fo56hr,millsa_acm,New Mortgage Advice,"Hey there,

So my fiance and I are looking to purchase a house, but I am weary about the monthly payments.  I have been a money hoarder my whole life, and seeing below a certain limit stresses me out.  We are wanting to start a family once we are in a house, so we are adding up bills with extra food and daycare included.  Here is a breakdown of what we have:

&amp;#x200B;

|Me|Fiance|Mortgage / Bills|Income|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Gas - $100|Gas - $100|P &amp; I - $1451|Me - $3718|
|Tolls - $100|Car Ins - $165|Prop Taxes $280|Fiance - $2300|
|Student Loans - $200|Phone - $100|Home Ins - $150||
|Car Ins - $145|Daycare - $700|PMI - $75||
|Phone - $90|Car Payment - $250|Food - $600||
|2 Pet Ins - $80||Electric - $200||
|Savings - $500||Water - $90||
|||Internet - $70||
|Total - $1215|Total - $1315|Total - $2916|Total - $6018|

&amp;#x200B;

Income ($6018) - Bills/Savings ($5446) = $572 left over

So this number left over is stressing me out.  Even though we already have $500 going to savings, I know these numbers will fluctuate, especially with a new born, and I think that is what worries me.  We currently do not have any car payments, but the one I included is a ""just in-case"" scenario to where we do have to get a new car for any kind of reason.  Am I wrong for feeling this way?  Some people are telling me that these numbers are fine, and ""we got by with a lot less"", but I just don't want to have to worry like that.

fo56ei,karaoke1,Property Taxes Paid for Filing Federal Taxes,"Hi personalfinance,

I bought my first home in June 2019 with my fiance, and have a question regarding our property taxes for the 2019 year that I'm having trouble figuring out from the forms I have. I will try to explain as best I can:

&amp;#x200B;

* When closing on our house, we opened up an escrow account to cover both taxes and insurance. We had to pay an up front amount at the time of closing (I believe to cover the time of closing through the time of our first mortgage payment), and then have monthly amounts coming out the rest of the year.
* The previous property owner paid for taxes up until the day prior to our closing date to cover that period of time.
* When filing taxes, I am asked how much I paid in property taxes in 2019. My form 1098 does not show that any taxes were paid, however I have money in my escrow balance
* From everything I've read (and I'm no expert and having trouble even finding information), it seems that taxes are usually pre-paid, or paid ahead. This makes me think I should have paid *some* taxes in 2019 given we've had the house for over 6 months.
* I confirmed with my mortgage bank that they didn't pay any taxes until January of this year (2020).

&amp;#x200B;

With that information, my questions are:

* Was my mortgage bank supposed to pay taxes for us in the year 2019? If so, how do I go about fixing this to make sure I'm all set and don't owe anything?
* I'm assuming if officially not taxes were paid in 2019, I should put $0 on my tax filing, but will this bring up some auditing from the IRS? Or is this situation normal?

&amp;#x200B;

fo4muz,Scomus11,Received a bonus,"Hi all, 1st time poster, short time lurker.  I received a bonus for $1700 from work. I was expecting it as it’s something my company does every year between Christmas and the end of March. With that being said, I bought my wife a new GE Slate appliance package last Christmas. The intention was that after this bonus arrived it would go towards that purchase. 

Total cost of the GE package after 33% off in holidays savings came to $3300. Being that I signed up for a new Home Depot credit card, as long as I make the minimum monthly payment (currently $28) I won’t have any interest until December 2021. I’ve been able to pay it down to $2300, but my hope was to use this bonus to get rid of a huge chunk. I hate credit card debt, and always pay it off each month. However, my wife and I just had a baby in February, and our hospital bills are starting to arrive. We’re very lucky with her insurance in that our co-pay is about 10% of the total cost, which comes to one bill for $1300 and the other for $400. (Yes, i know it totals $1700, what a coincidence).

So last night when i was opening the mail and reading the bonus letter from work,  my my wife acted like Chevy Chase from Christmas Vacation. We’re not installing a pool obviously, but she wants to use that extra money to pay for her medical costs (she’s on maternity leave until mid May). Only thing is that I’m not even sure if we’re going to receive more bills or if that’s it. I mentioned to her that we should sign up for a payment plan, but she has yet to call and inquire.  My thought is that the payment plan interest for the hospital bills, will be far less than a Credit Card. As for the Home Depot card though, I’m able to pay about $250/month with hopes of being done by December 2021 or earlier before interest starts to accrue. 

Guess I’m trying to see if anyone has sound advice on what to do with said bonus? I can also always wait to deposit the check to see if we continue receiving more hospital bills. Crazy thing is, we received her most recent bill for $1300 on 03/21 and the hospital wants payment by 03/29. How is anyone supposed to come up with $1300 in hand that quick??? Yes, we have a savings account, but even so that’s an incredibly short amount of time and with current market events I would hate to pull money from my mutual funds.

fo4m5c,raemurphy97,2019 college grad leaving $17/hr for $20/hr?,"Hello,

I studied communications and got my first job out of college working in development for a nonprofit. I currently make $17/hr but I love my job and the people I work with. I started my position in July and hate the idea of leaving before I’ve been there for a year. Plus I didn’t choose this field for the money but rather the reward of doing good (I work at a homeless shelter). 

I was asked by a different organization to apply for a position that matches my experience perfectly and pays minimum $20/hr. I don’t have the offer yet but I interviewed yesterday and it seems really promising that they’ll offer me the position. 

I’m terrified to leave a job I love for something I’m unsure about. I would be responsible for grant writing which is something I have experience in but have never been a grant writer so I would still have a lot to learn. I’m not struggling for money but it would mean paying off a ton of student loans a lot faster. I’m also scared I won’t get along with new coworkers as much as I do now. 

Any advice? Recommendations? It would be hard asking for more money at my current job since it’s a nonprofit and if there isn’t room in the budget (which is a lot tighter now with corona virus) then there’s nothing they can do.

fo4956,MortalButterfly,"Goodbye Car! I know I am screwed, but are there any other options or issues with this?","(First off, I'm financially screwed anyway. I already have a ton of debt, so I am not worried about credit score or adding to what I already have in collections.)

I have a car that has been a pretty reliable car for 3 years. I owe $5,100 on it, and have never missed a payment. I was content with making the payments and enjoying what would eventually (I estimated 3-5 more years) be a disposable car. KBB value is about $5-6k, but realistically it is worth less than $4k just because there are so many of this exact car in the area that they are going for very cheap.

Then out of the blue, it starts making noises and driving funny. I take it to the shop to get it looked at, and they start ripping it apart. Turns out the transmission has met with an early death, plus several other things need replacement for it to run right. Total cost to repair: over $6,000. That's right, $6,000 to fix a car I owe $5,100 and would only be worth $4,000 after the repairs. Also, the current bill just for ripping the car apart is already over $1,000.

SO. I really REALLY don't want to spend any more money on this car at all, and I don't even have any money to spend on it. My parents' advice and my gut instinct is to leave it at the dealer, not pay the repair bill, and not make anymore car payments. My credit will take a hit (I don't care), and the bank can work it out with the shop if they want to repo it.

Is there anything I'm not thinking about? Basically my goal here is to not end up in jail for doing something illegal. Collections and credit hits from this will just be a drop in the bucket at this point. I also don't want to pay $1,000 to get a transmissionless pile of junk out of the shop when it will just be repossessed anyway.",29,1585052683,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo4956/goodbye_car_i_know_i_am_screwed_but_are_there_any/,personalfinance,1

So - I just learned. When you call your creditors, mortgage lenders, utilities, etc. asking for help due to loss of income, if you just say you’ve lost work, income, jobs show cancellations, whatever, they can’t help you.

One you say “I have no income due to the Coronavirus”, that’s the keyword they need to hear to be able to enact their new policies, defer payments, halt late fees, etc.

And, apparently they can’t coach you to say it. You have to do it yourself.

I have a question regarding the new 2020 W4 form. 

I'm expected to receive a huge refund this year which means I need to correct my withholdings. I used the IRS tax calculator so I can try to get a better understanding of the new W4 form and correct my withholdings. 

I am confused on line 3. 

for line 3, it states ""add the amounts above and enter the total here."" which is straightforward in of itself.... but when i use the IRS calculator to calculate my withholdings, the calculator states the following on line 3:

&gt;Enter $963 for credits and other reductions to annual withholding (Line 3 on Form W-4 is already pre-filled in the Download button below

I thought Line 3 was simply only for dependents. Am I allowed to add any value here to make my refund closer to $0? The instructions are pretty clear that I shouldn't mess with steps 2-4 if they do not apply to me. 

I do not have multiple jobs, I do not have a spouse. I do not have dependents and I used the standard deduction -- should I really be entering something in Line 3 even if the calculator is indicating so?

fo3fsg,Supreme_Leader_,(UK) Airline cancelled a non-refundable flight due to coronavirus and will not reimburse. Is chargeback appropriate?,"I booked a flight from Port Vila, Vanuatu, to Melbourne. The flight was due to depart on the 14th March 2020. The airline in question is Air Vanuatu and cost 640.00 AUD for 2 tickets. This flight has been cancelled by the airline. 

At the time of booking, I accepted the fare rules that the flight was non-refundable and could not be cancelled. However, their conditions of carriage state that in the event that Air Vanuatu cancels the flight, the customer is entitled to a refund, if the customer does not find it acceptable to hold the flight in credit for a later date or able to use an alternative airline. 

So far, I have been told that the flight is cancelled and that I am not entitled to a refund, only the taxes. They referred me to their newly published commercial policy, published on the 16th March 2020 in response to the coronavirus. This reiterated that flights cannot be cancelled, only moved to a later date without penalty, and only once. Given the current situation, it is impossible to commit to a new date, especially given that I am travelling from the UK. This policy was also published after the time of my booking, and so should the original conditions of carriage apply? Am I entitled to a refund? 

The booking was made using an American Express card. Is this an appropriate time to process a chargeback? Is there anything to strengthen my case?

fo375f,Jackismyson,To Sell Home or Not to Sell Home?,"Folks,

I have been a long time lurker and now ask for your assistance in a potentially major life decision. 

Some background. We purchased our home in 2001 so we have some solid equity at the current moment. I am also in a position that I could work remote. My wife just got furloughed for two months.  My son has two years of HS left.  

The plan all along was to sell our house in two years when our son graduates high school, move to Florida and get him in state tuition (we have enough saved to pay for all four years in state. He is fine with going to in state school as he understands the financial benefit.)

With the state of the current world, I have been thinking it might be time to accelerate the plan. 

I am trying to determine if it would make sense to sell now before the market takes a hit, move, work remote, and rent for a while to see what happens with the RE market. 

This is how I see it and would like any input:

Benefits. 

* Sale prior to potential market drop. 
* Four years of in state tuition as opposed to one out of state and three in state (12 month residence requirement)
* Reduction in cost of living expenses as we would downsize to a smaller home/rental. Area is much less expensive/no state income tax.
* Able to work remote now. In two years that may not be the case. 
* If we rent for a couple year and RE market comes down, more buying power.

Cons:

* Moving during high school years although my son does not like the idea I am not sure it would be the end of the world for him

Please let me know if I am not looking at this correctly.

We have a 4th \*roommate\* (Person i know on the internet that has had a rough time and we did business, they help out with the crib, and share a room right now, because i wanted his first year to be comfortable) He wants us to get a cheaper spot so he can pay $100-200 a month but all the other roommates dont want to downgrade to a worse location.

he hasnt paid rent as i took him under my wing as i believe in his music and think he will blow up eventually could be this year but a year later everyone else has started generating lots of money so we could get our dream spot, he hasn't made much money to afford.

The spot we found is 3 bedrooms and i offered for him to live in the living room, everyone else is down and 3 out of 4 of us will be paying. He is living for free gets to record in the studio and really level up then work on getting his money up so we can upgrade.

This was a way for me to limit myself from overspending and dipping into my savings. However, I've figured that if I use the same bank for both accounts it'll be much simpler in terms of me budgeting and tracking my money flows (in and out).

fo1p0b,kevin6040,What is my best option for getting out of a car lease?,"Info: I currently have a leased 2018 Mazda 6 Grand touring in Washington, with about 2 years left on the lease. The monthly payments are 330( after tax), and I dropped about 2.2k on it in upfront cost. 

Question: What approach should I take for getting out of the lease? I know I can:

1. Buy the vehicle and then sell it 
2. transfer the lease to another person
3. Pay the penalty for terminating the lease early.

for 1, I am using Car Gurus and estimated my vehicle to be about 24k, this number could be really off for all I know. What are the fees and costs associated with this approach? I looked online and estimate about $850 overhead for fees associated with this, (500 for resale, 350 for buying contract for car)  


For 2, I'm not actually sure how much I can transfer the lease for.  I cant really find sites for an accurate indicator of how much I would have to pay (or potentially get paid) for this.

Can anyone help me out here?",7,1585039119,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo1p0b/what_is_my_best_option_for_getting_out_of_a_car/,personalfinance,1

I have double checked caps-lock and have re-entered my info many times now to confidently say that whatever they have on file for me must be different or their system is just flawed (which I have also read through Google). 

Is it advisable I do it via snail mail to the address they have listed? I am worried about lost mail but at the same time entering my SS over the phone or the internet also has risks.

fo11ux,divealt,"25 Years Old, Opening a Vanguard Roth IRA and maybe an Vanguard Individual Account?","Hi, I am a complete and total stranger to the world of saving for retirement and investing. I'm 25 and have ~60k sitting in my bank account that isn't being touched for the forseeable future.

I have a 401k with Vanguard and am contributing as much as my employer will match. The 401k is put towards the ""Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Trust Select"" fund.

I want to open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard, but am a bit fuzzy on which fund I should go for. I see a lot of love for the target date funds, but also a lot of love for the VTSAX fund. Any advice on which one to go for? I'm a very ""set it and forget it"" kind of guy, if that makes a difference.

On top of the Roth, I want to (potentially?) open up an Individual Vanguard Brokerage Account. Would it make sense to put the Roth IRA towards a target date fund and the Individual Account towards something like VTSAX? Or should I put them towards the same thing, like VTSAX? I'm seeing a lot of people recommend either one if I don't plan on touching it until I retire. Any ideas?

On top of all of that, my parents got me to visit a financial guy, but his mention of a 10% cut kind of turned me off to that idea. I see a lot of people share that same opinion, but would it be dumb to allow him to open an Individual Account with ~5k and see where it goes? Or should I just invest more into an Individual Account with Vanguard? The fund he pitched is the American Funds Growth Fund (PGWFX).

TLDR; Open a Vanguard Roth IRA, invest into which fund? Open an Vanguard Individual account (or don't?), invest into which fund?

Thanks for any advice you can give me.",10,1585035329,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo11ux/25_years_old_opening_a_vanguard_roth_ira_and/,personalfinance,1

Currently I'm working remotely in South Africa after school shut downs were announced.

Just today I found out that we're laying off 90% of staff in most of our countries where we operate due to school shut downs and lack of cash flow. My boss is fighting for me to be retained but even if she succeeds, I'll be seeing my work hours reduced by 50%-75% hours cut/wage cut and working remotely for the next 2-3 months. This prospect is a bit terrifying to me because I'm not sure I have the safety net of unemployment that US-based employee.

Technically, I'm a US-based employee and am issued a W2 that withhowlds US/California taxes but I've been claiming a foreign earned income exclusion since I don't spend more than 35 days in the US and have been claiming non-resident status in California to get my state taxes back (I haven't physically been in California in the las 18 months). If I suddenly lose my job, will I still be able to apply for unemployment compensation in California as I'm assuming my employer pays some sort of taxes to the state?

Lastly, being stuck abroad, what can I do?

  Hey guys, I found out about this hack for PolicyPal referral y’all can thank me later when it works because I just tested it and I'm still waiting for the $50.  


1. Create your referral link and then share it with your mother/father
2. And then buy the ELASTIQ plan (1.8%p.a. guaranteed) using their info, put in 5k for the plan.
3. Because it's shared by you, you get $50 CASH for buying, then mother/father get $10 credit (this one don’t count first save for next time)
4. They ALSO got promo for $10 cash for 5k premium. (wah siao, how they earn money haha)
5. You calculate $50 (referral) + $10 (promo) + $90 (interest) = $150
6. $150/$5,000= 3% guaranteed! Where to find?

Then after 1 year, you can withdraw, if after 3 months also can withdraw if you need. If you want the policy in your name just create a link for mother/father and share with yourself. If y’all wanna use the hack better hurry up before the tranche close or PolicyPal find out about it hahaha.If you wanna buy and lazy to create link, you get $10 credit if you use my link: [https://www.policypal.com/referral/r?c=rhino54](https://www.policypal.com/referral/r?c=rhino54)",0,1585035228,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fo118f/stand_a_chance_to_earn_cash/,personalfinance,1
fo10wz,deeplunacy,Should I do a credit card balance transfer?,"Hi,

I'm thinking of doing a credit card balance transfer through Bank of America. Looks like they offer a 0% 0-fee balance transfer: ""Introductory 0% APR for your first 15 billing cycles for purchases and for any balance transfers made within 60 days of opening your account."" , ""Transfer high rate balances and save on interest with an Introductory $0 balance transfer fee for the first 60 days your account is open. After that, the fee for future balance transfers is 3% (min. $10).""

My question is understanding how balance transfers work. If I get a balance transfer of 5k in the first 60 days, will I be charged no fee? So what happens after 60 days? Will I be charged a 3% fee if I don't pay the balance transfer back by then? Or do I only need to pay back after 15 billing cycles? This seems like a 0% loan for 15 months?

I'll probably be able to save 20k over the next 12 months. Thinking of taking out a balance transfer and investing it in SPY over the next month (5k every week?) and then pay it off over the next 12 months.

fnzqzl,BootyButtPirate,Selling a house?,"Lots of threads on buying houses in the ongoing calamity but I couldn't find many about selling.

Rewind about 30 days and I was finishing up the last round of patch and paint touch-ups on our current house. We then removed all non-essential items and furniture and took them to self-storage. The ""Coming Soon For Sale"" sign was put up in the front yard by the realtor. The photographer came by the first week of March and we were set to go live 3/12. My realtor advised he already had 4 calls for showings on 3/13 and planned an open house on 3/14. In our area (MD/DC) the inventory is incredibly low and decent houses went under contract in 24 to 48 hours. We had plans to find a home of choice and possible rent back for a week or month until we closed on the new home. We had finances sent up with the local credit union (3.5 30yr) and with our projected profits from our home sale would easily have 20+% for a down payment. Well, the world fell apart in our area on 3/13. All schools and non-essential businesses were closed. We had our realtor take our house ""Temporarily Off"" the market.

We both have stable jobs that should survive this mess unless the federal and local governments start to dissolve. Right now we are both working from home with our full salaries. Our school-aged kids are possibly home until Aug/Sept+. We have a skype meeting with the realtor tomorrow and are pretty sure we want to remove the listing and take the house off the market completely. The area we were looking to move was in the same school district and we were primarily looking to roll into a larger or better laid out house with different amenities. Our current house is ok but small and not laid out well for a large family, but we could be content for a few more years.

So, would there be any good reasons to continue with our old plan to sell/buy given the current mess? Also, if/when we do decide to stay should I look into a refi as I am currently at a 4.4 with 25yrs remaining. I could go to a 3.25 20yr or 3.5 30yr and make monthly payments a breeze.

fnzjld,draxmax,Cash from Home mortgage,"Given the current global situation I'd like to set myself up into a bit of a more comfortable situation for myself by having more cash on hand. The background is as follows: 
I purchased a house in January of 2019 at an APR of 4.25% and only put 5% down on a $259k. The reason I put so little down was because the house needed quite a bit of work, about $40k to be exact, so I spent all my cash fixing it up. Now I'm in the situation where I'd like a bit more cash in case things start to go south job wise. What options do I have? Originally I planned on reappraising the house with all of the remodel so that I could then have more equity in the house and be above the 20% threshold to eliminate PMI but now I'm not sure what I should do. Also given the current interest rate situation, it might be a good time to refinance as well but I'd need cash for closing, which seems like the opposite of having cash. Help me understand this.

fnz0vm,StoneryUsername,Girlfriend is being required to work 60 hours a week 6 days a week as a salaried employee; need help finding resources for her to confront her boss with.,"Hello all,

I hope this is a valid place to seek out people knowledgeable with the labor laws of California. My girlfriend’s employer is currently massively taking advantage of her. They gave her a salaried position about a year ago in order to take over for another employee that was being fired. She makes about $50,000/year with the position, which at first was a good proposition since she was perviously making $14/hour, the new position required more than just running a register and talking to customers, and she was told that she will still be working her normal schedule: two days a week off and ten hour shifts.

In the year since she has gotten the position, though, she has since been being consistently required to work a sixth day every week, an additional ten hour shift, and has been doing the same job as her subordinates which is mainly running registers and dealing with customers.

There’s all sorts of other little personal issues with the situation that make me angry but aren’t really relevant to the situation at hand, such as the fact that her superior consistently takes a week off every month and faces no repercussions for it, and also when my girlfriend confronts her superiors about the situation she is told things like the one day she scheduled off months ago is why she is being required to work six day weeks with no additional compensation for the next month.

Anyway, we did the math and it appears with the hours she works (not counting the fact that she commutes at the very least an hour both ways to work, which is wear and tear on her car and hundreds in gas every month) she only really makes about $16/hour with no overtime.

If she worked the same amount but at an hourly pay rate of $16/hour with overtime she’d be making almost $10,000 more a year than she is now.

So my question is does anyone have any links to legal documentation that covers issues like this specifically (in California)? My google searches turn up vary vague information about the general differences between exempt and non-exempt employees that isn’t too helpful.

I’m hoping to put together a little packet of relevant laws and regulations that would make it easier for her to confront her bosses.

fnywu2,myredditaccount112,What are you glad you started early in your life that paid off as you got older?,"I'm a young adult (22 years old) and just started my first job, and it's time for me to start spending my money more prudently. I still live with my parents and I don't have any student loans so I have relatively low costs right now. I want to take advantage of this and start investing for my future.

I read the guides in the wiki and it seems like I should prioritize an emergency fund (already done) and max out my 401k and any personal IRA's. I should be able to do this right now and maybe have some money leftover. 

Where should I put this leftover towards? I'm looking more towards options where I can just leave the money and have it grow without much interaction/tracking/worry over a long period of time (similar to 401k). I'm not too familiar with the market and stocks etc. so I want to avoid things that are too aggressive. 

What are some things I could put my money towards that I'll be glad I did, say 10 or 20 years from now?

fnyk1i,leopor,Set it and forget it,"
So, before all of this COVID stuff happened, I had about 350k in a UBS account that I’ve been accumulating and adding to over the course of some years. Of course I’ve been happy with it because we’ve had a great market for a while, so I never thought much of it looking into it because all of my family uses them and we were making money. All was good.  

Well, now that the market is burning it kind of made me wonder about my options and had me really looking into what I’m paying. I was a bit shocked to find out my fees are about $9,000-$10,000 a year. Probably going to be less now since the portfolio is only worth about 260k at the moment, but I feel like this is a lot. 

I’m 36 and don’t need the money any time soon, but I am looking for some advice on what to do. Been reading a lot about index funds where I can just set it on 3 funds, invest monthly, and let them self manage, which is essentially what I am doing now  but my fees would be much lower. Is this my best option? If so, which ones, and at what point would I reevaluate into less risky bonds?

I am not interested in picking stocks myself, I simply don’t have the time or desire to do so, but I also don’t want to be taken advantage of which I am starting to feel like I have been. I don’t expect anything to moon over night, just looking for steady returns. 

What would be the best firm to join if this is my best option? I have a separate 401k, 403b, 529’s,  and some other money currently with Fidelity. I also noticed they have some of their own zero fee funds. Or am I better off with vanguard funds? 

Are index funds commissions free trades, or would I be paying a fee each time I want to purchase more? 

Really just looking for some direction on where to go now. I realize I probably should’ve done this sooner, but I feel like I still have plenty of time to fix this. 

Thanks in advance for any input.",2,1585022719,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fnyk1i/set_it_and_forget_it/,personalfinance,1

fny7yk,mediocresmartstupid,"CD expiring, what is the next step in this economy","Excuse my trashcan account, I'll try to keep it as short as I can with all details.

I have $16K in an Ally CD expiring on the 30th, and after maxing out my Roth IRA ($6K), I was planning on putting 8K in Ally's 13 month select CD (currently at 1.90% APY + .05%APY for loyalty = 1.95%APY), and 2K in my savings.

I'm currently 25, no debt, live at home with parents and pay some expenses \[$150-180/month(only paying for car insurance, gas, some groceries,)\], and make anywhere from $500-1000 a month (job is technically per diem, but am guaranteed 8hr/wk at @ roughly $16.25 AFTER TAX, any extra hours are due to openings, but the job is stable IMO as I work in healthcare. My emergency fund is in an Ally savings account with about $1.2k. I have worked part time jobs since I was 18, have about $20k in a Roth IRA(only in Mutual funds ATM), 3k in 401K (company match is barely anything at all, but nice to know I started it). Planning on Physical Therapy grad school after graduation this May, so tuition/board/food could be anywhere from 80k-150k? haven't figured out the exact cost, but that's the range, applying to online schools, and my area have a couple schools I could commute, and there are some schools close to family, so I'm not too worried about rent, just worried about loans. With COVID-19 halting much of the world as we know it, the stock market has taken a major hit.I'm on the fence for getting on Robinhood, as the interface is simple and a good(?) starting point for beginners like me.  Now that the market is low and this pandemic doesn't look to slow down anytime soon, would it be wise for me to put about $3k in stocks? I'm looking at stocks as long term investments (major ones being Boeing, Microsoft, Visa, need to look more at smaller ones though), probably going to use dollar cost averaging and diversity the investments. My plan with getting stocks now, is so that in 3-5 years, I would sell some stocks to help out with loans that I will accumulate during grad school. Is this plan extremely risky? I'm obviously new to stocks and investments, but I'm trying my best trying to learn more about passive income and investing money.

Two options after my CD expires

1) Max out Roth IRA (6k), put 8K in Ally Select 13month CD (currently at 1.90% APY + .05%APY for loyalty = 1.95%APY), 2k in Ally online savings

2) Max out Roth IRA (6k), put 5k in Ally Select 13month CD at 1.95%APY, put 3k in stocks over the next couple weeks/months using DCA and diversity strategy, 2k in Ally online savings.

Obviously I can lower the amount I put into stocks but 3k is my hard limit, but I want to buy major company shares at these low prices to help myself grow later in life.",1,1585021177,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fny7yk/cd_expiring_what_is_the_next_step_in_this_economy/,personalfinance,1

I moved into an apartment on my own at the start of the month, before everything got crazy and I still had a job. Before I was living with a few other people. For the rent we just did PayPal or a check to one guy, who'd pay the landlord. I wrote one lump sum on the last check (Jan + Feb) because I knew I'd be leaving

I gave my former roommate that check at the start of February. The guy still hasn't deposited the check. He's never been particularly punctual with responsibilities, especially if they involve other people, but this is a different level

As I mentioned, I lost my job, and now suddenly I've had to dip into my savings a lot. I'm at the point where I either pay my rent for next month but don't have enough for the former place I was living at whenever he decides to deposit the check, or I'm late paying rent so that there's enough to cover the check (which I don't want to do since I just moved here)

I'm not going to reach out to the guy - he and the other former roommates got really petty and immature once I told them I was leaving, and frankly, it's not my fault he still hasn't deposited my check. I could reach out to my landlord and ask for an extension, but I'd rather that be a last resort
