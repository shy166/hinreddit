fso7h2,TheSheepOfDeath,Jager's buff-nerf,"Ubisoft is clearly trying to go onto the path that says ""ability is more important than fragging"". 

With the buff of Ying (another one and it is simply ridiculous... She's fine as she's right now, there is no need to give her smokes...) Jager can use his ability to destroy the candellas, frags (as there are more and more ops with frags (RIP Buck, no idea why he lost his frags)) smokes etc and with the nerf of his speed the Ubisoft is looking as if they were trying to make him an operator that would rather stay at the obj than roam. 

Also it's a buff to him and nerf to Wamai as Jager can simply destroy candellas while Wamai only intercepts them (of course, his magnet would be outside the objective, but Ying can simply throw another candella into the room. Wamai can do nothing about this because if he throws another one outside, the attacker is simply gonna shoot it). Meanwhile Jager can easily destroy them, what makes him stronger because of the strong Ying. I don't think that this patch will change any pickrate of him, because they made his ability even more important. Also, his gun is still amazing and of course there is a lot of Jager mains so basically nothing will change with him.",21,1585698307,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fso7h2/jagers_buffnerf/,Rainbow6,0

fsnw7h,PRDXNebula,My declining interest with siege...,"Over the past few months I've noticed myself playing siege less and less, but when I do I often just quit after the first game or two? Why? Honestly I think it's a mixture of things. Casual isn't very casual anymore, I feel like in most casual games there is always a plat or 2, which for someone who is low gold is an issue. The boring gameplay, you can argue that there is so much in the game now that each round is different from the next one but it doesn't feel that way, it feels like I spawn in have a risk of getting spawn peaked and if so spend the rest of the round doing nothing, then fight off against the same set of oporators because the meta is so strong right now you would be daft to stray from it. Then there is dying from stupid reasons, half the time rather than actually playing legitimate tactics, I see ""golds"" just vibing in a stupid corner that would not work for anyone else but they somehow manage to pull it off, also the whole ""hold an angle for the entire game then someone peaks you as you look away"" shit is so infuriating I can't comprehend it. And upon hearing that Buck (my main) is losing his nades, which fit his ability perfectly, with a dumb ass claymore that wont help compliment his ability in the slightest. You could of at least given him flashes, come on ubi. And that skeleton key ""buff"" is laughable, one extra shot and 1 extra in a mag? Do one.

I know some of these are just be being bad but I'm sure their are plenty of others out there just like me. So because of these reasons I will probably stop playing this game that cares too much about money and DLC than getting its shit straight.

fsng6n,Saltysmokemain,Lining out every change and explaining why they're bad.,"From the most recent patch notes, I legitimately think that only one *maybe* two of the changes should go through. I think that this is one of the worst proposed changes in over a year.

-Buck
• Is losing his frag grenades
I thought a lot of these changes, including this one, wouldn't need an explanation why they're a bad idea, but considering they were proposed, maybe it's not as obvious as I thought.
I think the reason why they're doing this is because Buck is always brought over sledge, but this is 100 percent not the way to bump Sledge's pickrate. The current pro league meta is already suffering due to lack of explosives and this just further exacerbates it. And no, Sledge is not a viable substitute because he's got a lot less range and is a lot slower at soft destruction than Buck.
• Is getting more skeleton key ammo and increased mag size
This honestly directly counters my proposed reasoning for why they took away Buck's frags, but I can't think of another sound reason to.

-Caviera
• Is getting the vortex on the M12
This is one of the changes I think should stay, but I don't think that means it's a ""great change."" It's just a quality of life change to an underpowered op.

-Jager
• Is now becoming a 2 speed
This makes Wamai objectively better at fragging which makes no sense since his gadget synergizes better with the anchor type playstyle. They still haven't made Jager's utility any less oppressive because they haven't done anything to it, they just keep going after his fragging capability and no matter how much you nerf it, he's still going to be good because that isn't the real problem. Nerf his utility, make Wamai a more appealing pick because he brings more utility, not because he's got a better gun!

-Mozzie
• Is losing the Super Shorty
This is 100% not the problem. I don't understand why they hate nerfing the things that directly make an operator overpowered, but they keep trying it and it just doesn't work. The biggest problem I see with the pests is that they do not give you nearly enough time to react to the fact they are placed and they're so small that they're surprisingly hard to notice even if they're placed poorly. I'm not even saying that these are necessarily the reasons his pests are busted, but I can guarantee you that they are the problem.

-Ying
• Is getting a 3 damage buff to her LMG
In a vacuum, I don't see this as a bad change. Shoot, I personally like the change since it's one of my favorite guns. The change is honestly a relatively inoffensive one since it doesn't really change a whole lot in terms of it's shots to down or kill, but it's a quality of life change that isn't game breaking.
• Is getting a 4th candela
In Ying's current state, I consider her to be the most underrated operator in siege history. The fact that the pellets go off in a 3rd of a second makes it so that good Yings can guarantee a flash on anyone that doesn't have a direct counter handy. I truly believe that the only reason she isn't seen in pro play is because frags are an afterthought in the current meta, but if they were a focus, she'd easily be a top tier. If they're gonna change her candelas in any way, they need to nerf them.
• Is getting her smokes back
Back when Ying came out, she arguably had the worst gun in the game. It had it's 650 rpm and it only did 34 damage and it had very jumpy recoil. This made it a consistent 4 shot kill to almost all operators and it was challenging to land those 4 shots. (I won't say that the recoil was the main culprit since I played on console at that time, but it's damage model certainly made it terrible.) Even though the T95 was so bad, professional players still ran her. Having 3 candelas and 2 smoke grenades was so powerful that some pros were willing to run her shotgun just so that they could use all her utility. I really want to drive home that there were professional players who were willing to use the six12 just because of how powerful three 1 second detonation time candelas and 2 smoke grenades on one operator was. Ying now has at least a solid and I would even call it great gun and they're trying to give her her smokes back. I guarantee you that if either of these ladder 2 changes goes through, she will be the most powerful character in the game.

-Kaid/Goyo
• Are having the TCSG's damage nerfed to 55
I like the change, but I hate the numbers. If these numbers stick, the TCSG will be a 3 shot kill on 2 armor attackers because of how damage is handled in siege. I'm going to use the P90 as my example since that is the gun I used for my testing. With the P90's current damage model, it does 22 damage to a 3 speed attacker. However with the exact same gun, if you shoot a 2 armor in the chest, the gun's damage will be reduced by 2.2, making the gun do 19.8 damage. Because of how siege handles decimals, it completely ignores the 0.8 and makes the gun only do 19 damage. Every single bullet fired into a 2 armors torso does 19 damage within 18 meters and not shooting through walls and such. I have no reason to assume that other guns work differently. Now if we do the same thing to the TCSG's proposed damage model, we would reduce it's 55 damage by 5.5, making it do 49.5 damage. And since this is siege, that 0.5 doesn't exist and we are left with an 11 DMR that kicks like a Mule and requires 3 shots to kill a twitch. I really think the only way for an 11 round DMR to be viable is for it to hit incredibly hard. I will say that 84 was a bit much, but if it doesn't do at least 63 damage, it's worthless.",12,1585695627,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsng6n/lining_out_every_change_and_explaining_why_theyre/,Rainbow6,5

Ying can bring 4 candelas and 2 smoke grenades which makes 6 at total.

Sledge can bring 2 frag grenades.

Maverick can bring 2 frag grenades.

Iana can bring 2 frag grenades.

Jager can hold up to 6 Projectiles. Attackers can just focus on 1 important point so let's say 4 max for a specific spot.

Wamai can hold up to 5 Projectiles. As Wamai players can Imagine you can't just separate the magnets  1-1-1-1-1 to important locations and you will only have 2 magnets when Action phase starts. So let's say 2.

Total countered projectile count 6. Remaining projectile count 12. \*\*\*THAT'S A LOT!\*\*\*

Because they have Maverick and Sledge. Operators like Castle and Goyo won't burn any utility at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming you all agree with the amounts and possibilities at the top so let's continue.

1- In my opinion, they should add an ADS Recharge timer to ads just like Yokai drone and Shock drone.

This thing is not going to make changes at things like protecting the Bandit. Because you will just start using frag grenades after burning it.

But this ""recharge"" thing can be a lifesaver at last holds of the objective. 

2- In my opinion yes Jager should be 2 speed but Wamai is 2 speed as well but he would be much more useful if he rotates quickly. So I am saying that he should be 3 speed.

3- \*\*\*Grenade Throwback\*\*\* This can be a lifesaver feature if the attacker is just using the grenade without cooking. 

So these were my ideas about balancing the projectiles because in my opinion they will be unbalanced after this TTS update.

Even though everyone is complaining about Echo being annoying Ubi seems to buff Ying every patch and nerf any relevant gun/operator.

Come on people theres no need for it. With the current state of the world more and more people are playing games and possibly joining siege for the first time. Should new players be voted out just for being new? No! Everyone deserves a chance to play siege. I'm just getting fed up with the toxicity increasing so much. I play siege because I enjoy playing siege. I dont play siege to get vote kicked from every game or to get team killed because I'm playing a character you may not like.

fsmonf,Gannon-Brooks,JÄGER Ballincing,I think Jäger should be a 3 speed 1 armor still but instead of having 3 ADS systems he should have 4 but can only take out 1 projectile each. This would make Jäger and Wamai more balanced with each other. This would mean you have to choose between Wamais statistically better gun but is a 2 armor 2 speed operator with Mag-Net system still being the same or you can pick jäger the 1 armor 3 speed with the statistically worse gun of the two with  but with the changes I mentioned earlier.,14,1585693102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsmonf/jäger_ballincing/,Rainbow6,0

fsmabz,NotEarlibird,"Ubi seems to want to make the choice between Jäger and Wamai more clear cut, but are doing the opposite","With the most recently announced changes to Jäger (making him a two speed), Ubisoft have effectively made him and Wamai as close to identical as Sledge and Buck. Jäger has a much higher pick rate than Wamai, but it’s simply because his utility is still better, his gun is better, and (since he is intended to be a roamer) he is faster. Wamai’s utility fills much more of an anchor niche than Jäger’s set-it-and-forget-it ADSes. In my opinion, a better change to the dynamic between the two operators would be to keep Jäger’s three speed (possibly increasing recoil or removing an ADS depending on how he performs at high-level play following the change I’m about to suggest) and make Wamai a one speed and give him the option of ACOG on one or both of his primary weapons. This would help him better fit that anchor role he is supposed to and make him a more appealing pick without chopping Jäger’s legs off as a roamer.",9,1585691855,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsmabz/ubi_seems_to_want_to_make_the_choice_between/,Rainbow6,4

Every time I get near gold one of the teams gets filled with unranked people.

I understand that because of mmr system without doing much you can get placed there. But filling games with a team having 3-4 people still placing creates a situation hardly fair for the other members in that team.

This is just creating a barrier allowing me to met pro players in low silver and some people that doesnt even know the maps on gold tier.

Yes, they will eventually drop, but the barrier of getting filled is there.

fsli7y,Orbxtal,Is Ubi trying to bully us into playing different ops?,"I feel like with the changes both making Jäger a 2 speed and taking away mozzies super shorty Ubi is trying to give incentive to play other operators for this utility. (Wamai as an alternative to Jäger now that they have equal speed, and Castle as an alternative to Mozzie since Castle now has the supershorty). I think they’re pushing to give reason to play underpicked or underwhelming operators in comparison to the frequently picked and very good operators. Now, I’m all for a change that would allow that, push for that even. I just don’t feel like bringing the good operators down in utility to the lesser ones is the way to go about it. Naturally you can’t buff them all to the level their better counterpart (like making wamai a 3 speed) because then you have too strong of an operator. I think Ubi is missing the compromise, they’re exclusively overbuffing or overnerfing ops in an attempt to make every op valid, when in a game like R6 that just isn’t going to happen. I know that I personally am much more likely to choose Wamai now over Jäger on a lot of sites, the Aug is statistically a better gun than the 416 and he’s got the option of the p12 or the Keratos. His ability is a spin off of Jägers that can be as efficient if used properly, I don’t see a reason why jager would be picked now. 
I feel like in an attempt to balance what operators are picked Ubi has managed to make certain key ops definitively less viable than others.

fsle5z,FutureEight,"If You Want to Decrease an Operator's Pick Rate, Buff Weaker Operators.","It is absurd that Jäger is yet again being nerfed. His win rate has been historically just above the 50% threshold, and there is no reason to nerf his operator. I understand that Ubi is trying to adjust his pick rate, but the reason his picrate is so high is that he has decent weapon, speed, and an amazing gadget. In this day and age, the defenders NEED someone to counter projectiles, and only two operators do that. A better way to drop Jäger's pick rate is to buff Wamai, better gun, more speed?, and change his gadget so that he can deploy them all in the prep phase. Nerfing Jäger is insane. This won't help Wamai's pick rate at all, and make defense 10x more frustrating. 

This strategy goes for many of the operators in the game. Want to improve their pick rate? Buff their fragging ability. A player who starts fragging better with a given operator will continue to play that operator more, because of the attachment they've made to that character. I understand the gadget is vital, but let's be honest, no one enjoys playing a gadget strong character with a Mozambique  shotgun level of firepower.

Thank you for attending my TED talk

What I was thinking, is that they should give his evil eyes a set amount of laser blasts he can use without the overheat. In turn, I think they should up the damage to make it more useful for plant denial while maybe nerfing the Alda by adding more recoil and lowering the mag size. The Alda is disgusting even without an acog and 81 bullets is just ridiculous for a defensive op. What do y'all think?

fsjoz8,Scouti_,I can't be the only one...,"Tl;dr Rainbow balancing is going in a bad direction rn.. and I don't think we should just nod with our head and take everything...

Am I the only one that thinks that the new balancing changes are stupid? I mean removing Mozies super shorty is weak, compared to what the situation as a whole is!

So first of all they are still trying to make Ying stronger and stronger.. I ask you why? like why do they want to make Ying a viable Operator that badly? there are other Operator that could need that kind of dedication more than Ying.. she's already strong.. But why would I want to play an Operator that I don't wanna play?

Second of all they, it seems like they are basing their balancing solely on ""How much is an Operator getting played compared to others"".. And that is wrong.. Making Jager 2/2 now is not making him less viable.. denying grenades, ash charges, *YING CANDELAS* (~~I swear to god on of the balancing devs is actually Ying main and sucks at the game~~(plz don't ban me)) and so much more utility, is imo way too Important as if I would not take that into the round..

Third of all I generally don't think that this is the way to balance stuff.. not saying I could do a better job! but they say they listen to their Community when they change stuff, but I never heard ANYONE saying that Jager needs to be slower.. But well.. Maybe I'm just overreacting at this point, and these changes will just make Ying a must have Operator, and not more like changing the general Balancing in the future....

fsj1q7,TheMagicalDildo,Wtf am I doing wrong? (PS4),"Did Bethesda publish this game? Am I forgetting something? I could swear the game had in-game voice chat, but I haven't been able to talk to anybody in the game, and there isn't even a mic icon next to their name. 

I also have played outback eleven times today alone, with only 4 matches being off outback, three of wich were chalet, the other was bank. It's been like this for  weeks. Only slight variation. I don't mind outback, it's okay. I also don't mind chocolate cake, but I don't want to stuff eleven of them down my face without stopping. 

There are currently 14 maps in casual (I'll play ranked when the voice chat starts loading), I have not gotten more than 5-6 in a day of around 40 matches, for the last week or so.

I also still don't understand the prioritization of reloading your primary over anything else, lime switching to your fully loaded secondary, or getting up from the prone stance. 

I used to think it was just my dualshock 4, which, is quite the steamy pile of nope (feels nice to hold tho), but I tried it on Bloodborne, and it was perfectly resposive (well the analouge sticks drift but whatever), and after mentioning it every so often, even noticed other players who've accepted this as fact for years (again, Im on ps4, I'm sure pc is perfectly responsive while you get wallbanged by hackers)

But whatever, I know this community. I just need to ""get good"" because that totally doesn't have literally no influence on these things. 

I guess once I get out of plat, my game will stop crashing, too, eh?

Complaining? Maybe, but does that doesn't exactly mean it's for no reason, and if you read this far. 

I love you, I wish I had your patience.



And your pillow -_-

fsho4q,T4Labom,"Please, Ubisoft, do not buff Ying","By the gods please there is no need to buff Ying that much.

I've been maining her for a while now and as for effectiveness, she is incredible, the fixes to the Candelas really made her viable and powerful and she can hold her own easily.

Giving her 4 Candelas and 2 Smokes? There is a name for this and it's Power Creep. Not only she will be able to burn whatever ADSs or MAG-NETs that are in the room, but she wil be able to block line of site WHILE pushing an objective that has been completely covered with her flashes.

Remember why you guys took IQ's Frag Granades? Same reason, she could destroy any gadget from the floor below and then frag everyone she desired. Remember why you removed 3 granades from Zofia's launcher? Same reason, she could burn ADSs and still make a mess in the objective.

Please, Ying is a strong operator as it is. If you guys wish to buff her kit then increase the gun damage or RPM, increase the range of the Candelas or revert the timer nerf so she can throw them quickly; giving her stuff isn't the right thing to do.

Don't buff nor nerf balanced operators because people don't want to play them, Ying is not appealing but she is more than reliable now. This is why characters like Glaz are not usable anymore, cuz instead of balancing them, you guys buffed him to the heavens then made him useless. 

I can see the same thing happening to Ying, leave her alone.",4,1585677358,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsho4q/please_ubisoft_do_not_buff_ying/,Rainbow6,2

Since I'll be playing them long term, I want some ops with some higher skill caps that I won't get bored of and will be useful.

I already do have 1 Elite skin... for Mute. Love it, but need 1 more def and 2 offense.

I want ops with a lot of player agency.

I'm thinking: Valkyrie, Twitch, and Capitao. But not a huge fan of Capitao's skin.

fsglx3,Booquafiusthe3rd,I’m done with siege.,"Welp, I quit siege.

It’s not that I hate this game, it’s just I hate the fact that I die to the biggest bullsh*t and it’s not even my fault. Everytime I go into ranked I keep on dying to bs audio. For example, someone who I’m hearing is behind me, is apparently infront of me. Whenever I hear something get broken on my left, it’s actually to my right. Half of the time the audio is like this and half of the time it’s perfect. Crouching audio doesn’t register even when my audio is at max and it’s the same situation everytime. I can’t take it anymore, my kd is going down the drain and it’s not even my headsets fault it’s the game. Ever since this season started my audio and trying to distinct where it came from has been terrible. Unless someone has a way to fix audio being all over the place I’m done with this game. 

Can’t forget about headshot hit indication being terrible this season as well. I’m getting tired of someone doing a run out, I’m clearly headshotting they but then they kill me. Not even a headshot but a neck shot spray and pray.  I trained myself to only hit headshot for an entire week only to realize that if you have no skill you can just spray and you’ll get a guaranteed headshot.  I swear this season is the pure epitome of a clown and I don’t know what the devs at Siege did but ever since this season, headshots and audio have just gone down the drain.",5,1585674004,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsglx3/im_done_with_siege/,Rainbow6,0

fsfn19,TheTechDweller,Kali and the CSRX300,"I'm a low-mid plat player, and I've recently decided to try to dedicate a lot of my efforts in siege to finding out how viable Kali and her sniper is once you spend the time to perfect her. I'm not that great at aiming, but that's an improtant factor. Most people that have played Kali for more than a few rounds realise that there's not many spots long range you can sit and be helping the team. Unless you're droning your team in, but the issue there is you're not usually able to immediately act on any info you get, or if your team needs help and you need to push.

Her sniper is obviously not suited to close range, but lets look at the other sniper operator in the game and compare a few things. Galz's sniper is catagorized as a sniper not a DMR, however it shares a lot of the same properties and plays very similarly to a lot of the DMRs (now that they have destruction changes). The scope was originally intended to be flip up/down because the designers thought using the scope was too difficult close range. So glaz can still use his strong primary weapon to be effective in that range.

Kali can swap between 'Too much zoom' and 'are you kidding me x12'.

I understand all the descisions made to the rifle on release, they're introducing an incredibly powerful weapon that acts like no other gun in the game. I get why they made it clunky and slow, however I just think they went a bit too far.

Again, I am just a plat player, not a pro, but we've seen how Kali is beginning to perform in pro league the few times she's picked. Very low win rate, there's not enough games to properly judge, and also the factor that most players will probably not bother spending the large amount of time to perfect her, when you can do her job with another operator but better.

She needs a more reliable secondary. Almost all the iron sights in this game are bad, the pistols and SMG secondaries are held too close to the operators face and the sights are too blocky, you cannot accurately track targets, and you can miss enemies out of sight due to the irons. I suggest either adding a sight to the C75 and increasing it's recoil, or giving Kali Clash's SMG secondary. Since they made it full auto, it's actually a good gun. Definitely reliable and comfortable, something Kali needs as a secondary.

If she doesn't get a good secondary, her sniper needs to be easier to use. I'm not suggesting making it a quick scope machine. Tiny adjustments go a long way since this weapon all revolves around the bolting of the gun. The bolt time is one of the most important factors, that along with ADS time. The majority of the time playing Kali, you either hit your shots or you die doing no damage. This risk is usually not worth the reward, as usually the longer time you need to aim to take the shot, you could take damage or just be headshot by a full auto gun that started firing before you could even see them.

I suggest 50% less vertical recoil per shot, and 0 horizontal recoil. Hitting that 2nd shot is incredibly hard as the movement of the scope while bolting combined with the incredibly intense vertical kick, you often lose sight or cannot precisely hit your target with the 2nd shot. I've tested the gun a little with those changes and it is much nicer. The kick on the sniper should not make fighting even worse than it already is, you already have a MASSIVE disadvantage.

I also suggest decreasing the zoom level of both 5x and 12x by 25%.

The 5x zoom is totally unnecesarry never mind a 12x. Of all the places I've tried to find interesting Kali angles, the 12x zoom is still never needed. It's a meme and since we can't even change our sens independently, it messes up your aim. 25% is still not enough to make the gun OP. you can just use the gun a little bit closer than before, or just a little bit easier.

&amp;#x200B;

Any of these changes would be a good step towards making Kali a little bit easier and more comfortable to use, while not increasing her killing power that much. It's still totally down tot he person using the gun, this just allows a few more people to pick it up and try to learn, without being punished so hard in so many ways.",0,1585670881,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsfn19/kali_and_the_csrx300/,Rainbow6,1

fsegho,TangoAlphaNovember,I've lost 250 MMR this season due to cheaters...,"As the title says, over the past couple months I have lost 250 MMR total due to cheaters in ranked. This season I dedicated more time to play ranked and try to grind in order to get plat again. I placed gold 2, reached gold 1 as my highest MMR and kind of got stuck there. I usually play alone but occasionally pick up a friend or two whenever we try to get serious with the game. 

I've lost the 250 MMR through three random instances of cheaters getting banned, the first time I lost \~90 MMR (from one of my placements most likely). The second time was \~80 MMR and just today \~50 MMR. Overall, this season has been one of the most frustrating. My W/L is close to 50% and my K/D is a 1.2 currently. 

Not trying to whine or anything, just trying to understand how it is not easier to catch the cheaters, especially when other games have pretty solid methods of banning them (player speed detection, game file modifications, etc.).

Side note: Ranked matches should be nullified if someone leaves within the first match, Overwatch has a pretty decent system set up for this.

Immediately after the salt started to accumulate in all chat. Claiming I’m a smurf despite me literally just starting playing siege last weekend. Then for the rest of the game I was tked after dropping plates every round because I was being “toxic”. Sorry I’m good at shooters, guess I’ll just sit in obj with my nose in a corner to appease these people since I keep “taking all the kills”...

This game has been so good, I enjoy the mostly realistic tactics, the close quarters gameplay and maps. (Sometimes). But things have really been looking down.


I understand Ubisoft wants to add more content to the game which is beyond respectable and they run a business so the game needs to make money. Buuuttt..

The really 'fortnite' like skins and weird cosmetics are stupid as f*** to me. Like why do we have a Christmas tree skin?? My god. 

The constant tk's and overall crumby people you play with.

I almost always join mid-game. I rarely ever get a fresh game. 

I always seem to get the same three or four maps - constantly day after day

The new operators?? Especially Iana?? Isn't this game supposed to be somewhat grounded to reality? And before you hit me with ""what about pulse and the EMP's"" yes I know but that's different then a walking drone

The 'Elite' skins?? 

The y5 pass cost the same but I get less now? 


I started playing this game to get away from all the childish like games like cod, fortnite, and others. But I feel as if this game is drifting into one of those types of games. I have nothing against change or innovation but it just seems like they're straying away from what made this game so special. 

Hate me all you want it's just my personal opinion. I still enjoy this game but it's becoming less and less every time I read about upcoming things for this game.",15,1585659933,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fsckc2/overall_game_rant/,Rainbow6,1

Where you can only play if your above 150 or 200 Level 

2. A limited time gamemode (a few or so) Where there are only the starting operators. Pretty much a Timetravel back to when the game released, and the old maps (Old Clubhouse/Kanal/Hereford(!) (without bugs and server issues of course)

We werent in game chat to be fair,but that doesnt stop us from being considerate players. We ping,use cameras,I try to wait and be last pick. So while I dont know the circumstances leading up to it,I hopped into game chat to hear them slinging slurs and curses. The best part? Three against two how would you ever win a kick vote? We left after round two. Today I watched what was clearly a four-stack om the other team just kick vote probably a dozen players in one game. We just sat there on defense setting up traps watching the feed go off and every time they got a fifth person they got ""removed"" from game. They killed a few of them that they didnt manage to kick before they loaded into a round,and we eventually stomped them because they were playing like idiots. Theres got to be a better system for reporting and banning. Assuming they do that kind of thing in every game,shouldnt the system check how often someone commits friendly fire/team killing?

Spåra, Attacker, Särskilda Operationsgruppen, Sweden

Originally employed by the Swedish National Forensic Center, Spara led the development for advanced forensic technology capable of scanning crime scenes and recreating Artifical Reality imagery from live data at the scene. She was picked up by the SOG who supported her invention further. She begun to apply her work to training situations and finally a more portable version was able to be taken into an unsimulated operation. This caught Six's eye and a transfer request was made, offering Spara support from Rainbow's head of R&amp;D. Finally a helmet mounted version was created, although it had a much smaller area of effectiveness, limited by field of view.

Virtual Bullet Trajectory Reconstruction - by scanning an area of wall, recent bullet holes can be analysed to recreate and project the bullet tracers to Spara's HUD.  This displays a sort of holographic projection to the player, showing where the bullets fired had come from. Only recent bullet holes can be scanned. Limited max charges but the ability refreshes after long cooldown.
Unlike with Jackal a Spara player wouldn't get a mark to track the enemy and instead would have to use their brain to follow the tracers to their origin. This extra challenge is why Spara's can recharge unlike Jackal's helmet. It would also have much longer range, to help scan bullets from the safety of doorways and holes.

Weapons - LWRC 7.62 or M870 shotgun. Glock 17 or CBJ-MS.

Gadgets - Stun Grenade or Claymore

2 Speed

Spåra is swedish for Track/Trace.

Tord, Defender, Beredskapstroppen (Delta), Norway

Tord has had a lengthy career within Delta. The nature of the unit's missions over the years led to his focus in non-lethal methods of taking down enemies when possible. As well as being involved with Delta operations such as the Torp hostage crisis, he was once deployed to Kosovo a member of the UN's multinational Special Team Six. His experience had him brought into Rainbow where he worked closely with the team's electronics experts in developing the LIPCED.

LIPC Electroshock Device - Attached to the tops of windows and doors the LIPCED is a trap set off by electronic and human entry. It fries any electronics that pass through the door or window, acting like a temporary mute jammer against attacker gadgets and drones. It also hits attackers who enter with a low damage but debilitating electroshock. Due to the nature of a LIPC rapidly heating the air there is a loud boom when activated. It isn't a one use trap either, but it is on a cooldown, represented by a charge up noise easily heard by nearby players. I'd imagine Tord is limited to two or three LIPCEDs due to their multi-function and recharge.

Weapons - MP7 or Remington 820. P226 or USP.

Gadgets - Bulletproof Camera or Barbed Wire

3 Speed

Tord translates to Thundering in Norwegian, in reference to the sonic boom induced by LIPC and LIPC's  relation to thunderstorms and lightning conduction.

Niall, Attacker, Garda Síochána (SDU), Ireland 
Son of a former SDU detective, Niall followed his father's footsteps and quickly rose through the ranks. He has experience dealing with public unrest and bank robberies and applying crowd control to handle situations.

CS Gas Launcher - switches to a breechloaded riot gun that fires a tear gas grenade that begins to emit gas in an increasing AOE. The tear gas does no damage but leaves people with blurry vision and less accurate ADS. The Tear Gas is fired with some force, and will bounce off hard surfaces. If striking a soft surface it will partially breach and remain stuck. Directly hitting a player will deal minor damage, bouncing into players results in even less.

Weapons - AR33 or Super 90. P226 or USP.

Gadgets - Stun Grenade or Claymore

Niall has a few potential meanings, champion, cloud, avid, or passionate

Augen, Defender, ARD 10, Switzerland 

Augen is trained in long range mountain operations, spending weeks at a time amongst the Swiss Alps, Augen developed incredible stamina and patience. A keen eye for the smallest detail was displayed in her results in outdoor shooting ranges situated in the snow-capped mountains.


Threat Detection Goggles - flips down the goggles on their helmet. These goggles highlight enemies like a bulletproof camera, and also highlights grenades and other deadly gadgets. But this comes with downsides. It can't see through smoke. A glow is visible from the goggles when active, similar to cameras. and the player's FOV is reduced slightly, with the borders of the screen covered by the rim of the goggles.

Weapons - MP5SD or 552 Commando (No ACOG). P226.

Gadgets - Deployable Shield or Nitro Cell.

Augen simply means Eyes.

Mol', Attacker, Special Operation Forces, Ukraine 

A combat engineer within Ukraine's armed forces, Mol' developed a means to quickly and easily apply small cameras, such as surgeons may use, into special military operations. Additional Intel with reduced risk to an operator's safety, which obviously interested Six.

Mole Camera Drill - drills a small bulletproof camera through soft and hard surfaces, including soft flooring to see the level below. Hard surfaces take longer to drill through and make a bit more noise. The camera cannot turn once placed and can't be recovered. It can be destroyed from front or back by melee and explosives. Can only be shot from side of entry, where it appears more prominent. 

Weapons - AKS-74U or Saiga-12. PMM or Fort 17.

Gadgets - Breaching Charge or Claymore.

Leer, Defender, DSU, Belgium

Part of the DSU's observation unit, Leer received recognition after their involvement in operations to hunt down metro bombers. Their keen interest in surveillance systems and facial recognition techniques aided their time in the DSU while also attracting the attention of Six. In collaboration with Meghan 'Valkyrie' Castellano and the R&amp;D compartment, Leer produced a unique helmet camera that could provide mobile intel in full gyroscopic motion.

Gyro Helmet Cam - Helmet mounted camera with full gyroscopic control. Can turn helmet camera on and off (if you don't feel like being watched). When turned on it provides an additional camera for the defending team. Temporarily disabled by EMP and can be hacked. If the camera was turned on when Leer is killed, it remains on unless it was a headshot. Headshots destroy the camera, including corpse headshots.

He suggested Jäger losing one of his ADS’s, Wamai, Smoke, Ela and Echo losing their shields etc. which would great. There are too many operators that has option to use the shield.

Then there are Valkyrie, Jäger, Wamai, Goyo, Maestro, Echo, Lesion, Ela, Kaid, Bandit (and tricking) etc. you get the point. All of their gadgets makes it harder to get on site.

The meta is simply boring and annoying. There is way too much to clear. Ash and Zofia getting one more impact would help a bit, but not much.

So i just want to say thank you to all this guys, making rainbow six the game that we love.

fs7zn0,KrysKus,Weapon modifying,"I my opinion siege needs more options how to customize your weapon. But not too much just 1 or 2  new options to each category or rework some of already existing options ehm ehm silencer ehm ehm. I also have few specific ideas and I would like to hear your opinion on it.

1. 1,5x zoomed in sight. I think I'm not the only one for who when uses holo enemies are too far away and when uses acog everything is too zoomed in so I would like to see some middle ground

2. rework for red dot. Okay so don't get me wrong I also like it but only when I aim down sights and I think this problem that most of the players has that it looks ugly. And my awesome solution is...*insert some dramatic drums here* ... just to throw away this one and slap on the rod dot that we have on pistols.

3. Make Nomad's special reflex on her AK available on more weapons. Maybe same for that red tod-holo hybrid that Clash has on her burst fire pistol?

4. Rework for... *just imagine the drums now*... silencer. So I just want to make it viable option that's it. So get rid of the damage nerf just throw it out of window and make it better up recoil your first three shots. I was thinking to also make your hip fire spread 15% - 25% worse but I don't want to make it plus and cons game soooo yeah.

And now behold: My controversial ideas

5. Add green laser that polish ops has to all guns. But it's green that means more visible (I think) so to make it worth the bigger risk make it better up recoil of your first 2 or 3 shots. I know that with this I would take from them what makes them ""special"" but with all those passive abilities they have I think it's not gonna be that much of a deal

*Really controversial warning*

6. Extended barrel rework. Instead of reducing the damage drop of which does nothing just make it add 3 or 4 damage to the gun. And also take it away fro Ash and Jäger then.

*extreme controversial warning* (I think)

7. Hybrid grip. This weapons: P10 Roni, MP7 and IQs AUG. When you look at them you can easily see that you can manipulate with these grips so my idea is that it would be special option for just weapons like this. This grip would have same effects as angled and vertical grip. When you ADS your character bends the grip into angled position and when you finish with ADSing your character would bend it back into vertical position. And if this is too over powered just make vertical and angled grip available for those guns.


So this is it. Please if you have any feedback or suggestion write into comments.

His C7E has little to no recoil and a good fire rate too AND it has an amazingly quick reload too, this gun will always be ready for you, you dont need a vertical grip on this since the recoil is already nonexistant. PDW9 has a 50 round mag and an insanely high fire rate, meaning you should almost always win fights with this headshot machine, even without headshots. His third option is a shotgun so it wont always compare but definitely not to be slept on either.

fs7613,Buck_Shot1,How Does Ranked MMR Work?,"I would have never noticed this, but after the 1000 MMR max difference was implemented it has become apparent to me.

I was in a game with my friend who is a gold 2, I am bronze 2. W were over the 1000 difference, so he lost a few games and got right on the line. We played a game (and lost) and the end scores were as follows:

Me - 12 Kills, 5 Assists, 5 Deaths

Friend - 4 Kills, 6 Assists, 7 Deaths

I was at the top of the leader board and my friend was at the bottom. The entire enemy team was low silver except a single bronze 1 (everyone was higher rank than me, and lower rank than my friend). The problem was, we were unable to load into another ranked after that game because our MMR was too far apart. We recorded the last 2 minutes (a feature on Xbox for anyone unfamiliar) and noticed that I lost 72 MMR and he lost 65. This was just enough to put us outside the 1000 MMR range and we couldn't play together.

My question is why did he lose less MMR than me when he did worse to a team of entirely lower ranks?

On a side note: I'm not sure how many people I speak for, but I would MUCH prefer if matchmaking just went off of the highest person's rank and let anyone play together. It is a pain for all of our friends with greatly varying skill sets to play together. Since the limit has been introduced we have not had a group of more than 3 in ranked and it is getting really annoying.",9,1585632575,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fs7613/how_does_ranked_mmr_work/,Rainbow6,1

fs4i8n,LegendaryFlamed,Defender Idea: Nausea,"Nausea is a 2 Speed 2 Armor defender.

His primary weapons are the M870 Shotgun and the T5 SMG (Lesions gun)

Secondary weapons are the 1911 (Mavericks Handgun) and the SPSMG9 (Clashs Secondary, however with the MP5s Iron sight)

His ability are 4 Teargas canisters.

The Canisters are thrown like Smokes Gascanisters. The radius of the TGC (TearGas Canister) is about 75% of smokes. 

Unlike smoke, they do not harm the attacker. From outside the smoke is like Smokes, you can lightly see through it. However being inside, you get the same effect as when triggering a grzmot mine. 
The attackers sight gets dizzy, the camera shakes and you get slowed down. You can still plant, but the time it takes to plant is 1,5 the time it normally takes. 

If a defender walks into the TGC's smoke, they do not get the same effect, however the cloud is very thicc and their vision gets severly worse. 

The TGC's smoke lasts for 9 seconds and he doesn't have any counters besides staying away from the smoke and does not go through walls. Unlike in Smokes gas, Finkas Surge does not have any effects on the operators inside the smoke.

His gadgets are Barbed wire and a bullet proof cam.

Idea for a buff:
1. C4 as gadget, but remove 1-2 TGCs
2. ADS time for attackers in smoke increased, so is recoil
3. Can see clearly through his own smoke

Idea for a nerf: 
1. remove 1 TGC and the slowdown effect on attackers
2. Make T5 SD (build-in silencer resulting in damage drop off)
3. When lying down, Smoke effect is not as worse as when crouching/standing

The whole idea of the operator is to be an alternative to Smoke. He cannot deny a plant but he can slow it down, buying himself some time. He can be played vertical, having a very good shotgun and a decent sidearm choice.",9,1585621121,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fs4i8n/defender_idea_nausea/,Rainbow6,1

She spent her whole life trying to find him and training to kill him. Her machete can destroy his Evil Eyes in one hit.

fs3sdf,Pinpuller07,Suggestion for a change of pace.,"So I've been talking to my brother about the way that matches play out and we had an idea.

Context: I know the current meta is the 20 second thing and metas within ranks are all different. With that said we both like to take our time, drone out rooms, setup strats and distractions.

So, the idea is the attackers would gain a set amount of time everytime they get a kill. To keep proper pacing the amount of time gained from kills decreases the longer the defender is alive.

Example: kill a spawn peeker and gain 25 seconds or kill a defender with 10 seconds left and gain 4 seconds.

I think this would help attackers gain time to be more strategic but also keep pace late game when things are errgent. This would also reward/punish risky play.

I'm not trying to say this is a great idea (it could be horrible for all I know) but I just wanted to get some feedback from a community that knows much more than I do.

Thanks everyone.",1,1585618332,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fs3sdf/suggestion_for_a_change_of_pace/,Rainbow6,1

fs3l2o,LegendaryFlamed,Defending Operator Idea: Nausea,"Nausea is a 2 Speed 2 Armor defender.

His primary weapons are the M870 Shotgun and the T5 SMG (Lesions gun)

Secondary weapons is the 1911 (Mavericks Handgun) and the SPSMG9 (Clashs Secondary, however without a sight)

His ability are 4 Teargas canisters.

The Canisters are thrown like Smokes Gascanisters. The radius of the TGC (TearGas Canister) is about 75% of smokes. 

Unlike smoke, they do not harm the attacker. From outside the smoke is like Smokes, you can lightly see through it. However being inside, you get the same effect as when triggering a grzmot mine. 
The attackers aight gets dizzy, the camera shakes and you get slowed down. You can still plant, but the time it takes to plant is 1,5 the time it normally takes. 

If a defender walks into the TGC's smoke, they do not get the same effect, however the cloud is very thicc and their vision gets severly worse. 

The TGC's smoke lasts for 9 seconds and get countered by Finkas Adrenalin Surge making the effect of TGCs not as bad.

His gadgets are Barbed wire and a bullet proof cam.

Idea for a buff:
1. C4 as gadget, but remove 1-2 TGCs
2. ADS time for attackers in smoke increased, so is recoil

Idea for a nerf: 
1. remove 1 TGC and the slowdown effect on attackers
2. Make T5 SD (build-in silencer resulting in damage drop off)
3. When lying down, Smoke effect is not as worse as when crouching/standing

The whole idea of the operator is to be an alternative to Smoke. He cannot deny a plant but he can slow it down, buying himself some time. He can be played vertical, having a very good shotgun and a decent sidearm choice.",5,1585617560,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fs3l2o/defending_operator_idea_nausea/,Rainbow6,1

This game just doesn't work. Every season there is a problem... It's riddled with bugs. 

\-Today I got DDOS'ed two times in a row.

\-I can't pass some doors for some reason, game teleports me back.

\-Most annoying of them all, **the connection issues**. Every 2/3 of matchmaking there is an error. I   
constantly rubberband in seemingly random games (It last's all game but not all games I play have   
this problem). This is not an ISP issue either. I called them, made them open ports (because I myself    
don't know how) did all the things to do. My friends also have this problem, some of them use   
different ISP's. **I followed every instruction there is to follow in hope for a fix**. I'm on ethernet as   
well by the way.

   The thing is, some things are going to be fixed for sure there are going to be new bugs for sure and I   
   can accept that. However, I've been playing this game for 1200 and waiting for it work properly, and

fs2gm2,Sghirappa,Does anyone else find interesting the idea of a Realistic mode?,"No fire spread indicators, only sights, no hud, you can't ping enemies.

The no fire spread indicator is so you don't know how the spread varies if you are running, moving or standing still and you have to depend on your knowledge of the weapon.

The missing hud is so that you don't know your ammo count, your hp, how much time is missing, which operators are on the enemy team and where the objective is which means you have to depend from the information that you have seen droning or have received from callouts.

The inability to ping enemies is so that, similarly to the missing hud, you can't know the exact position of an enemy on the map. In this situation you have to rely on your knowledge of the map and your ability to track the enemy or escape from him knowing only what you have seen or what you have been informed of by callouts.

fs1vt9,Jaziri47S,"Battle Royal, can it be done?","Hello my people,

I know that Rainbow six isn't a game that is made for that type of gameplay, but, did we realy think about it?  
I mean, woudn't be great to play that gameplay that we all love to love, rappelling on windows, breaching doors and wall banging in a battle royal event?!  
For sure we would need to create equipements that you can loot, speacially for the one shot head shot, a helmet or something, cause i'm sure it can be furstrating at some point, maybe even forget about Rook or thermite, and focus more on a ""type"" of gameplay, a hunter, a hard breacher or whatever, i know you people, you have great ideas to send to Ubisoft right? \^\^  
What i mean by that is, i realy love battle royal gameplay, it's nice to be full focus and aware of how you engage people, surround them, and how to leave if needed etc.. but i played them all, and they all sucks, except battlefield that has something special (but WWII weapons sucks and that's an other story), so latley after few hours trying to enjoy call of duty warzone, i did realise something, that i would take out all the call of duty bullshit (UAV, Airstrike etc..), and that sadly leave us with a preety good map and.. hummm.. is that it? maybe the Goulag is funny, but i think it's also something to talk about on an other Sub Reddit.  
So ! since we have Rainbow six siege, maybe we shall put in that context and see? generating a map isn't that hard, we have weapons patterns which is the hardest part in my opinon, and then program a good brainstorming and make an event out of it, right?  
I will leave you complete this post and let's talk about it ! =)",15,1585611271,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fs1vt9/battle_royal_can_it_be_done/,Rainbow6,1

fs1iw6,BlackTedBundy,The amount of Smurf’s in this game are heavily pushing away a new player.,"I recently started playing this game as it was gameshared to me (Xbox). 

I am not new to shooters, and I do fairly well in matches. However, the amount of smurfing is absolutely pushing me away from this game. Almost every single match has a smurf on either my team, or the enemies. I can tell this by their game score, games played, and when the account was created. 

Is there anything at all to combat this? I can’t exactly “git gud” when I’m being shot through a wall where someone takes a random guess where I’m at. I understand some people are just good at the game, but when you’re in newcomer lobbies and the enemy team is absolutely flooring you, knowing every little spot you’re in, immediate peaks followed by a headshot, it’s incredibly frustrating. 

I love this game so far. It’s possibly one of the best shooters I’ve ever played and I love to play tactically.

If I want to play on uPlay, can I only buy the Standard Siege edition? Since I guess my ops, pass and stuff transfer I dont need to buy like deluxe or something.

And last but not least, can I somehow move Siege from Steam to uPlay without needing to uninstall it on Steam then Reinstall on uPlay? Like if I can move a folder or something.

So I had friendly fire active from then. Alright, no big deal, I don’t intentionally shoot teammates so I can work around this. Then, several rounds later, we’re rushing the site, and I end up cooking a frag to throw in a doorway. I didn’t call this out to my remaining squadmate since we only had ~15 seconds left and we’re trying to keep comms clear so we can hear the enemy, and he ends up sprinting through that doorway. Because I had reverse friendly fire active, I got banned. Why is this a thing? I get that it’s wrong to teamkill but this was in a tense ranked situation where I accidentally killed another play *who was in my own squad*.

frxjyw,nebola77,Why can't the RB6 Servers fit 10 people?,"Obviously exaggeration .. but I started playing again around start of february.

Already in the first game, I remembered why I quitted like 2 years prior, it's the constantly disconnecting people from every game. I usually play in 2 stack with my best friend and we have games where I don't even know what to say. Game starts and we are only 2 or 3 in team. Or people dc in the first round. People dc mid game and often don't return. In my team and in the enemy team. Are the servers just that garbage? I play in silver bracket, around silver 1 currently, but I can't believe that all these people, are actually just leaving on their own ""will"".

I made an excel sheet and noted every game we played in the last 10 days (20.03.-30.03.20), we played 63 games in total. Here are the stats:

&amp;#x200B;

* Total Games: 63
* Games with atleast 1 DC in one of the teams and player(s) didnt return: 21
* Games with atleast 1 DC for more than 1 round but player(s) returned: 11
* Games played full length with 5 vs 5: 31
* Percentage of Games played or ended with less than 10 players: 49,21 %

&amp;#x200B;

We had a situation, where my friend searched for a ranked game, I wrote him to invite me so we play together. He cancelled the queue and we started a new one together. In the game we then played, my friend got a message that he gets a 30 minute ban after the match and that he will lose mmr. In my opinion the problem might be, that people don't get an ""invite"" for the game like in literally every other multiplayer game. CSGO, Dota2, etc. you get an Invite you have to accept. In this game you don't. It seems like my friend got an ""invite"" but when he cancelled the search, the game still thinks you will play another round. Following this, you obviously can't connect to the game (because you never knew you had one) and get banned/a penalty. This game needs something like an invite if you get a game or that it just doesn't start if there are not even 10 players in the scoreboard.

&amp;#x200B;

frutyu,T4Labom,Team Six's Funkiness Levels (100% CANON),"This is a canonic list on funkiness of the operators in Rainbow Six: Siege. Since this is 100% confirmed to me by Tom Clancy’s himself, there is no need to search it on google, you gotta trust me on this one:


Jackal: He is spanish, so he is always getting funky, sometimes a bit too much that annoys everyone else.


Nomad: She likes to get funky by stopping people from getting too funky… you know… like when you are telling your mom something cool you did but then it turns out to be a moral lesson?

Alibi: The main problem of Alibi is that her holograms are the funky ones, Alibi herself often try to copy their funky vibe due to the lack of self funkiness.

Clash: Boy, she is the funkiest operator in defense, probably the only funky enough to be in the the Disco category… like… Le Freak kinda funky you know what i mean.

Mozzie: He's hella funky, very chill, very funky, not Clash levels of funkiness but he funks too.

Ela: Man… how do i put this here… she doesn't funky… she is more of an emo kind thing? But doesn't mean it's bad, just a different kind of way to get funky, right? Oh well, she good, very good, but no funk, only emo rock.

Gridlock: Not as funky as Nomad due to diabetes.

Caveira: Brazilian funk is a VERY different kind of funk… and it's not pretty… i'm not rating this one.

Lesion: I don't trust the chinese police. 


Mira: Probably the only one that has the potential to beat Clash in terms of funkiness. Because she was born Spanish, her funkiness levels are already high by nature, but due to being shy, Mira is often 2nd place while Clash puts her funky vibes on everyone's faces.


Lion: Ever since he got punched by Thatcher, his potential to get funky got downgraded a lot. Now he can only go funky for a few seconds before someone reminds him of that awkward moment in his life and gets his vibe checked.


Thatcher: Born in the funkiness, raised in the funkiness, dude knows his moves and is a literal monster on the dance floor. Some say he is able to beat Clash but no one knows for sure since he is always being banned for being way too good.


Tachanka: No, contrary to many beliefs, he has little to no funkiness inside him. That's why when going funky and succeeding, everyone goes nuts.


Montagne: The only one to ever get funky by simply standing in one place. It's like his energy you know? He is just… funky… nobody knows exactly why to be honest, but if you ever meet him in the floor, try not to look funkiless.


Rook: This man was the most contagious operator of them all, everybody liked when Rook would hit it. His funky vibes made people wanna join him and get funky alongside him… until that one day… when a greedy, envy and grumpy man didn't like Rook's funkiness… “Rook mine” was his words before pulling the trigger… RIP in peace, friend.


Doc: Used to be hella funky like Rook and be like his sidekick on the floor… but after what happened to Rook, Doc's funky vibes went to a dark path. Now he goes looking for people to get their funkiness checked at the beginning of action phase instead of getting funky with people and healing them… it's a sad story.


Ying: Still don't.


After this Mister Tom Clancy's was called to an important meeting with his wife's cassarola and just told me that the rest of operators weren't as funky enough to deserve to be mentioned… but i doubt about him although i guarantee Glaz is the least funky of them all.

fruax7,Brotherinarms1,New idea for how MMR and rank works!,"So while playing with 2 of my friends I came up with an idea of how MMR gain can be changed as my friend is currently stuck in silver because he had to waste all of his high MMR games in copper. Ok so what my idea is a multiplier system, for example, if you win a game the MMR multiplier will increase making your next game worth more MMR for better or worse while losing will turn that multiplier into a negative multiplier. The negative multiplier would act similar to winning multiplier for example if you have a 2x winning multiplier and you lose you would lose 2x MMR but the multiplier would decrease incrementally by like .3x or something. Haven't worked out the details obviously but This would completely eliminate elo hell and get rid of the attitude of being stuck in silver and getting 15 MMR a game so better wait for next season to have a chance. Obviously MMR multiplier would cap at a certain gain like 80 or so but that's all details. I would love to hear everybody's feedback on this idea and feel free to add ideas!",2,1585586788,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fruax7/new_idea_for_how_mmr_and_rank_works/,Rainbow6,1

The only thing that drags this thing down is the toxicity, and I don't know how often other people encounter toxic people but I always seem to be going into matches where there is at least one. Just the constant team killing and the stuff they do to make your team be at a disadvantage, and I don't mean messing around in casual because I'm all for messing around because it's casual! Also god forbid you mess up when you have a 4 stack on your team, mess up instant kick and they keep doing it and it's not fun. It just seems there is so much but there is barely anything I can do no matter what mode your in there will always be that one guy.

frt93r,Foxy212,The toxicity in this game is horrendous,"During the last game I played before this post I was tk'd in the first round, verbally abused and pretty much bullied for the remainder of the game by one dude cos I'm ""bad"". Yes I'll admit I'm not great but such toxicity is not necessary. Prior to all this I had been in a game with the individual and I failed to clutch so i guess that was his ""reasoning"" for making my game absolutely hell. In the end we won (I came last and he came second) yet he continued to be a toxic arse.

Now usually I have thick skin and have come to accept in my nearly 2years of siege that this is just part of it but the fact this sort of crap happens so often is disgusting. It is the reason why I have a strong love/hate relationship with this game but when I want to enjoy it, it gets ruined by toxic players and that's just unfair, especially on new players who might get driven away by it all.

Despite that we actually won the match which felt pretty amazing. I reported the guy too and I just got an email from Ubi basically saying ""thanks for the report, we have sanctioned a players account..."".

Fantastic stuff. Except now I login and I received a match making adjustment, losing MMR due to the hacker.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't really understand. What is the purpose of punishing the hackers opposing team? At most I'd expect everyones MMR in the match to be voided. Going from Gold3 to Silver1 isn't a big deal, I would just like to understand the logic behind it.

frrl7x,denhamfree,Interesting Operator Idea,I just randomly had a dream which inspires this idea and it probably wouldn’t ever work but here goes: I was thinking of an operator that could kinda control a dead operators body (this would be an attack op) and they could run around and shoot with it but to make sure its not too overpowered the op they control has to already be dead so the defending team can realize that its not real and the person controlling it has a certain distance away from their actual body that they can go with the operator. I was thinking that it’d be a good operator to go through and destroy utility and traps. Also their weapon (when controlling a body) would only do one damage and would be semi automatic (headshots do one damage too). That way they never get in any big fire fights with the defending operators but can still destroy utility safely. It seems kind of silly when I write it out but I feel like it is an interesting idea.,19,1585577837,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frrl7x/interesting_operator_idea/,Rainbow6,1

frocry,T4Labom,List of operator's Funkiness (100% CANON),"This is a canonic list on funkiness of the operators in Rainbow Six: Siege. Since this is 100% confirmed to me by Tom Clancy’s himself, there is no need to search it on google, you gotta trust me on this one:


Jackal: He is spanish, so he is always getting funky, sometimes a bit too much that annoys everyone else.


Nomad: She likes to get funky by stopping people from getting too funky… you know… like when you are telling your mom something cool you did but then it turns out to be a moral lesson?

Alibi: The main problem of Alibi is that her holograms are the funky ones, Alibi herself often try to copy their funky vibe due to the lack of self funkiness.

Clash: Boy, she is the funkiest operator in defense, probably the only funky enough to be in the the Disco category… like… Le Freak kinda funky you know what i mean.

Mozzie: He's hella funky, very chill, very funky, not Clash levels of funkiness but he funks too.

Ela: Man… how do i put this here… she doesn't funky… she is more of an emo kind thing? But doesn't mean it's bad, just a different kind of way to get funky, right? Oh well, she good, very good, but no funk, only emo rock.

Gridlock: Not as funky as Nomad due to diabetes.

Caveira: Brazilian funk is a VERY different kind of funk… and it's not pretty… i'm not rating this one.

Lesion: I don't trust the chinese police. 


Mira: Probably the only one that has the potential to beat Clash in terms of funkiness. Because she was born Spanish, her funkiness levels are already high by nature, but due to being shy, Mira is often 2nd place while Clash puts her funky vibes on everyone's faces.


Lion: Ever since he got punched by Thatcher, his potential to get funky got downgraded a lot. Now he can only go funky for a few seconds before someone reminds him of that awkward moment in his life and gets his vibe checked.


Thatcher: Born in the funkiness, raised in the funkiness, dude knows his moves and is a literal monster on the dance floor. Some say he is able to beat Clash but no one knows for sure since he is always being banned for being way too good.


Tachanka: No, contrary to many beliefs, he has little to no funkiness inside him. That's why when going funky and succeeding, everyone goes nuts.


Montagne: The only one to ever get funky by simply standing in one place. It's like his energy you know? He is just… funky… nobody knows exactly why to be honest, but if you ever meet him in the floor, try not to look funkiless.


Rook: This man was the most contagious operator of them all, everybody liked when Rook would hit it. His funky vibes made people wanna join him and get funky alongside him… until that one day… when a greedy, envy and grumpy man didn't like Rook's funkiness… “Rook mine” was his words before pulling the trigger… RIP in peace, friend.


Doc: Used to be hella funky like Rook and be like his sidekick on the floor… but after what happened to Rook, Doc's funky vibes went to a dark path. Now he goes looking for people to get their funkiness checked at the beginning of action phase instead of getting funky with people and healing them… it's a sad story.


Ying: Still don't.


After this Mister Tom Clancy's was called to an important meeting with his wife's cassarola and just told me that the rest of operators weren't as funky enough to deserve to be mentioned… but i doubt about him although i guarantee Glaz is the least funky of them all.",1,1585564332,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frocry/list_of_operators_funkiness_100_canon/,Rainbow6,1

frnuqq,LeslieMfChow94,"I did it, I finally uninstalled my favorite FPS game of all time","Well this is most likely going to be a long post. I’m sure not too many people will care to take the time to read this post, but I thought I would share my thoughts and how I arrived at this decision.

As the title suggested, this is my favorite game of all time. Only with the release of the awesome arena style FPS Doom Eternal, a game that makes you think during combat almost as much as R6, has a game came close to challenging R6’s position.

I started playing this game on Xbox, I must add, during Red Crow. I came in on the end of Year One, but my God it felt like I didn’t miss a thing. I instantly dived into the most strategic, tactical, enjoyable shooters I had ever played. I was awful like most people when they first start up R6. But throughout my first two seasons I became more knowledgeable of the maps and the strategies it takes on each of them to win. I was and never have been the best with my gun skills, but I learned certain maneuvers and tricks to better prepare myself in firefights. Then came Velvet Shell came and Ubisoft added Mira: an operator that completely changed the meta and kept me on my toes as an attacker. Operation Health came and turned me off from the game. I then missed Blood Orchid because of the bad taste OH left in my mouth. I came back at the very end of White Noise and scraped by being placed into Gold. I don’t have much recollection of my early days on Rainbow. The biggest takeaway from my first two seasons (Red Crow and Velvet Shell) was that this game had brilliant map design to offer. Sure there ugly ones like House and Bartlett University, with an unbelievable amount of spawn peaks for Jaegar ACOG to send a round through your skull before you even had time to break open your first barricaded door. But for every bad map, there were 2-3 more perfectly designed ones to contrast it. Bank, Border, Chalet, Club House, Consulate, Kafe Dostoyevsky, Oregon (perfect R6 map to me, prior to the rework), and Skyscraper. These maps were amazing and show good balance (for the most part) when it comes to attacking and defending. 

And then came Year 3. From here on out I became a Plat player. What defines a Plat player? Well it’s entirely subjective, but it surely isn’t a flashy K/D ratio. I never was able to master the art of abusing Ash’s tiny hit box, crouch and lean spamming my way through a rush on my way to site. I sure as hell didn’t get the one taps as much as everyone else did. But what I did do was learn the maps, learn the “strats,” and learned how to work with a team in order to win rounds and in turn win games. The beauty in R6 isn’t in the “run-outs,” the spawn peaks, the successful rushes, the clutches, or the narrow defuses. Those all are enjoyable things, but for me the beauty of Rainbow lies in what hooked me to begin with back in Red Crow. The teamwork! Putting 5 minds together and running a team effectively and with the upmost amount of coordination. And with that great team play came my success in Year 3.

Slowly but surely however the game began unsatisfied with its own success. The game began to turn its back on what made it enjoyable to begin with, and the community did it no further justice. The maps became more and more one-sided, one-dimensional, and left a sour taste in the mouth of someone that praised the map design from the get-go. Yacht got tanked for no good reason and a rework was never considered, Coastline offered nothing inventive except ridiculous angles from the room, Tower was just down right abysmal, Villa offered little in terms of originality, Fortress came and went with the wind, Outback offered nothing in terms of good map design, the unnecessary but decent reworks to Kafe and Clubhouse, and then the absolutely unjust removal of Skyscraper from the ranked pool. But the nail on the coffin for me was the rework of Oregon. I LOVED Oregon. I considered it a flawless masterpiece when it came to a respectful balance existing between offense and defense. A well-balanced amount of spawn peaks for defenders, but also a well-balanced amount of entry points for attackers. Rushing was viable but just as viable as slow pushes from the top down were. And then the rework scraped any sense of harmony that Oregon provided in terms of design. They butchered the basement and even made dorms not as appealing. 

Just as the maps started to become less and less appealing so did the operators. We went from brilliant additions such as Hibana, Mira (let’s just skip right over Jackal), Buck, Blackbeard, Caveria, Echo, Valkyrie, and Frost, all of which were amazing concepts for operators that altered the meta in a significant but well-received way, to disasters and sorry excuses that nearly broke the game such as Lion, Dokkiaebi, Clash, and now Iana: an operator with an infinitely-respawning drone and Oryx, a guy that single handily destroys the concept of having hatches because he can vertically traverse in a way that is down right stupid and painfully annoying for attackers that are already working on a tight schedule. The new additions slowly moved further and further away from team play into solo-kings that people instalock. When I first started playing, picking operators was situated first on having the essentials to attack or defend a room. It then turned into picking a well-balanced supporting cast to fill optional roles. It has now turned into (who’s going to insta-lock the newest operator with great solo-utility before me?). 

And lastly but most importantly of all the community over the years has degraded down to a pulp. I once admired every teammate I ever had and any opponent I ever faced. From my teammates I learned coordination, strategy, and the effort it takes to work together and secure a win. From my enemies I learned new strategies, run-outs and spawn peaks, and counter-options. From my failures, I gained knowledge. From my successes, I gained humbleness. I respected everyone I was matched with or matched against because they saw the same beauty in this strategic masterpiece as I did, and they most likely knew something that I didn’t. That thing could be something that I learn and add into my arsenal of in-game knowledge to propel me through the ranks. Then came the smurfs, the mouse and keyboards, the guy that went invisible every round, the guy that glitched himself into a laundry machine every round, the guy that caused Clash to be removed from the game not once, not twice, but God knows how many times. The game degraded. The community was no longer focused on achieving harmonious and sound team play, but instead focused on finding that next clutch, that next successful rush, or that next individual strategy to perfect. 

And here I sit, in Gold 1 on my 4th year of playing the game, without a teammate to play with, contemplating. Contemplating, is it worth keeping this game installed? Are the small moments of individual success or team-success (initiated by my clutches or strategies 90% of the time) worth all of the headaches? Is the small amount of enjoyment that I still receive from this game’s base design worthy of the space that it takes up on my hard drive? And, for the first time in 4 years, I just said no. I just uninstalled, and it’s sad really. I put over 400 hours of my life into this game. I’ve put so much time and effort into perfecting my individual skills so that I could work better with my team. 4 years! Lasted about half as long as my parents marriage did 🤣!  Just as I became completely comfortable with my gun skills and started to morph into the player that could solo if necessary but still be able to hunker down with a team, playing the strats as I’ve always done, I finally looked around and saw that the game I had fell so in love with back in Red Crow had changed completely, and for the worse. The game itself, the community that composes the game, and the developers that fail to address the critical issues of the game such as SMURFS, glitches constantly being present in new seasons, overpowered new operator releases that are sometimes meta breaking and almost always focused on solo instead of team play, new maps that are nowhere close to the originals in terms of design and balance, and map reworks that are unnecessary and have now ruined my favorite map of them all, Oregon.

Hopefully one day I can find that spark again that pushed me to improve on my play, or pushed me to work with guys I didn’t even want to be around in order to win games. But that day is not today, and as of now, this game will stay uninstalled.

TL;DR: 4 years of my life, and what does my favorite game have to offer me? Disappointment",1,1585561701,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frnuqq/i_did_it_i_finally_uninstalled_my_favorite_fps/,Rainbow6,1

frnpao,greyrat_,Suggestion - Kali and Ash reworks,"I propose a change to compliment the roles both operators are supposed to fulfil.

# Summary:

Swap their gadgets. Give Ash the LV Lance and Kali the Breach round.

**Ash**

\+ destroy more utility

\+ team has more utility to support a hardbreach

\+ can damage defenders behind reinforcements and black mirrors

\- breaching capability

**Kali**

\+ can open new lines-of-sight

# Reason:

Kali is spilt between two roles; marksman and thatcher alternative. On most maps, Kali isn't picked because she lacks effectiveness in close-range which results her not being used as the thatcher alternative. Giving her Ash's breach round will allow her to create new larger lines-of-sight from range.

Ash is already used to destroy utility and this change would add utility hidden behind reinforced walls to that list. I don't feel this will make a significant impact on rushes ~~because all three-speeds can achieve this~~ but should hinder her effectiveness in certain ash-rush strats.

I doubt this will significantly change either's pick rates but will make both perform better in their intended roles.

This should be achievable (and reversible) simply within code as it's only the projectile that is exchanged.

I feel like because this is such as radical change to Ash, it should be delivered with a disclaimer on the Test Server that isn't intended for the live version of the game.",10,1585560875,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frnpao/suggestion_kali_and_ash_reworks/,Rainbow6,1

frmn7y,BigDanDizzle,The next step(s) for Rainbow Six as a franchise?,"(Xbox one player for context regarding Siege)

I've played several Tom Clancy games over the years, my personal favorite is still Vegas 2, many matches of Terrorist Hunt on Villa! And with Siege, I bought it day 1, and got the Season Pass for the first 4 seasons. 

I played the game heavy for the first couple years, I'm not a 1-game guy, but I'd say it took up the majority of my attention when gaming with buddies. At the time I enjoyed the more tactical pace, leaning while walking, destruction, etc. But as the years have gone by, this game just seems like it's being stretched too thin in terms of quality.

At this point I pop the game in every couple weeks to check on it, run casual matches with buddies, but it's not even fun for me due to the game feeling dated in areas. It's not completely fair to constantly compare Siege to games released after it, but the animations feel stiff now, bland graphics, and sound/visual glitches just never go away. 

I haven't bought the Season 5 pass, I don't have a desire to sweat in Ranked anymore, let alone buy a S5 and S6 pass. I respect Ubisoft pouring all these resources into this game, but what's next? Siege 2? Vegas 3? What happened to that Zombie/Outbreak trailer that came out that existed in the Siege universe?

It seems like with the lack of new weapons and ""fixed"" maps replacing new maps, this game is simply out of memory. I miss night maps, Plane/House not being rotated, etc. I understand Ranked has restrictions, but casual has suffered greatly. I just don't want to see this game have 6, 7, 8 seasons and we don't get any other Rainbow Six games because of that. Thoughts?

Tl;dr Big fan of Siege since Day 1, but the game/franchise/brand could use a refresh or new entry IMO. New operators can't fix the structural issues/sound and visual glitches",6,1585554919,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frmn7y/the_next_steps_for_rainbow_six_as_a_franchise/,Rainbow6,1

The quarantine mode was cool and all but the hardness of it took away from the scary aspect. I feel like zombies would make a pretty cool enemy to go against especially if theres a ton of them in different maps along with other enemies like from resident evil?

frl0z7,nordplague49,"(OPERATOR CONCEPT) Israeli, Prophet (MEDIC)","Country: Israel

CTU: Shayetet 13

ATTACKER

2 Armor 2 Speed

Avigdor ""PROPHET"" Eleazar

Born in Taibe, Israel Avigdor was born into the Jewish faith and was taught the ways of god. As a child Avigdor studied hard and long trying to understand the writings but the constant gunfire and explosions threatening the country kept him on edge. At the edge of 13 Avigdor's father died in a terrorist attack at a check point into Israel, this would lead him to want to protect other's from facing the same fate as his father. When Avigdor was drafted into the Army at 18 he knew that this was the best way to protect Israel. Avigdor joined the Israeli Defense Force Medical Corps (IDFMC) and after 4 years of combat experience joined Shayetet 13 as a medic. Avigdor has worked along side American forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and has run into Blackbeard on a few operations.

Team Rainbow was looking for a front line combat medic and with Blackbeard's recommendation, they recruited Prophet.

&amp;#x200B;

Prohpet gadget: Wailing Wall

Avigdor ""Prophet"" Eleazar comes equipped with a unique shield that allows him to fully block off a wide door way and can freely place around the map and the shield is just tall enough to where you can't be headshot over it. (2.5 seconds to deploy the shield). Behind the WAILING WALL is a medical bag that either Prophet or allies can use to heal 45HP. When you interact with the medical bag it takes 2 seconds (interaction animation), after the 2 seconds you will start regenerating health. You can freely move during this process though moving at faster speeds will make healing slower. While standing still regenerate 3 HP per second while walking you regenerate 1.5HP per second and while running you regenerate .5HP per second.

 If you are poisoned the healing will be completely removed (you will keep the health you have gained over the time it was healing but furter healing is removed) but will prevent the poison from harming you any further, if you're burnt healing will be delayed by 3 seconds and you will only heal 20HP.

\-This shield is completely Bullet and explosive resistant.

\-The Medical Bag can only be used 3 times.

\-Both Attackers and Defenders can you the Medical Bag if Prophet left the Wailing Wall up on the map so it is cruical he defends it.

\-Can NOT overheal.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

LOADOUT:

(primaries)

&amp;#x200B;

\-CTAR-21

A compact bullpup rifle with low recoil and high rate of fire, great for CQB.

&amp;#x200B;

\-GALIL ACE SBR

Fires a 7.62x51mm cartridge. Great stopping power at the expence of recoil and less effectiveness at range.

&amp;#x200B;

(secondary)

UZI (stockless)-

The slow rate of fire makes up for it with low recoil and great accuracy.

Can equip the foregrip and mozzies P10 RONI sights

&amp;#x200B;

Equipment:

Breach Charges

Smokes

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Counters:

LESION- poison from GU Mine remove healing effect.

GOYO- His Vulcan shields can burn a healing attacker (or defender on accident or maybe on purpose) and can delay the healing process.

BANDIT/KAID- Can shock the Wailing Wall damaging attackers who touch the shield or interact with the Medical Bag but will NOT destroy the shield or Medical Bag.

&amp;#x200B;

Synergies: 

Prophet of course works well with everyone, who doesn't want health?

But he works really well with tanky and already slow moving operators and operators that can use his shield. Not to mention he can protect Thermite, Ying or Fuze while they deploy their gadgets by placing his shield on either side of them.

MONTAGNE, BLACKBEARD, KALI, GLAZ, YING, THERMITE, FUZE

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

With the introduction of Prophet a new mechanic is added where you can drag downed teammates by the arm. While dragging a teammate you will move as fast as a 3 speed walking, your downed teammate will have his pistol drawn while being dragged. The pistol will have 7% more recoil due to the fact that you're using one hand.",9,1585546342,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frl0z7/operator_concept_israeli_prophet_medic/,Rainbow6,1

frkau6,Ghost_Melone,Warden as an operator needs to be buffed,"Considering that Warden's gadget is the least applicable, and least useful, Warden himself should get a buff, that way in the situations, where he is useful, he'll actually contribute to the team, rather than just being completely useless. I made a list that states all the buffs that could be added to him without completely overpowering him:

1. He should be able to see through smoke while moving when he has his glasses activated, otherwise he'll just get crapped on by a glaz on the other side. Glaz not moving makes sense as he is a sniper. Warden needs to stay somewhat mobile, otherwise he'll easily be picked off.
2. When his glasses are equipped he should be able to withstand Zofia's concussions. the whole point of warden's ability is that it allows him to clearly see through obstructive gadgets, such as flashes and smokes. Why would Zofia's concussion mines be any different?
3. He should be able to scan and ping enemies with his glasses similar to a camera. I'm not saying you should be able to spectate his glasses if you're dead. Only he should be able to scan. But if this were implemented, this would make his gadget that much more useful as teammates would be able to take guessing shots at the enemy and in some situations provide cover fire.
4. He should have a P-90. The P-90 is the weapon that the Secret Service use, not to mention this would make him much more lethal compared to him being equipped with the MPX.

frjae0,kokosushinick,Operator Idea,"Operator: Attacker

Date of birth:
January 11, 1994

Nickname: Doja

Name:
Dana Dall

Place of birth:
Aalborg , North Denmark

CTU:
Jagerskopt 









EMP SD Censor
When you go near Doja, your gun will lose its dot in its sight and her ads time will become quicker. Her speed will also be increased slightly.
When the six second period is over, it will take 25 seconds for it to recharge. You can start it after 12 seconds, but it will only last for 3 seconds.




Counters:
Mute Jammers will end the 6 second period
Elas Gadget will stop her gadget and still blind her




Weapons

She will be a 3 speed, 1 armour. Her Primary weapons are the P90 with the reflex, red dot, or holographic scope. She also can add a suppressor, muzzle break, or compensator to it too. She also has the FMG 9 that has the holographic scope, (vertex scope) reflex, or red dot. She can also add the extended barrel, suppressor, muzzle break, and compensator. Her secondary weapons are the Usg 40 with the muzzle break and supressor. and the 5.7 usg with a muzzle break and suppressor too choose from as well.



Reason For This Operator

The point of this operator is to make the defenders play less selfish ops like roamers and play more team ops.",4,1585538378,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frjae0/operator_idea/,Rainbow6,1

fri1o5,rafaeldiasms,Toxic community and my friday night experience (as a father in quarantine),"It's friday night, baby is sleeping and a got a full hour to play some casual matches on R6. All of my house duties are done and life's good.

I open a cold one while matching... and then I got vote kicked 3 times on a row before even spawning.

4th time is the charm, now I'm playing and suddenly got team killed by some dude laughing on the mic... Then I got kicked again.

Tried one more time, on the 3th round some jackass shot me on the head while securing the room. 

So I just closed the game and went to play singleplayer Uncharted.

I tried to play ranked but the matches are a bit lengthy for my spare time, so I just try to enjoy some casual quick games. 

But on the last few weeks I have seen some really toxic players, specially kids screaming on mic, shooting friends and screwing the objectives just for fun.

Can you guys help to sort out this situation? Any recommendations on game modes that are more reliable?",6,1585533271,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fri1o5/toxic_community_and_my_friday_night_experience_as/,Rainbow6,1

I think this would help newer players and not as skilled players to learn maps by playing on them more and being able to help them rank up as they can consolidate their map knowledge.It also means that it would encourage them to play better and be rewarded for getting access to a new map.",3,1585526166,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frg6qr/changes_to_the_ranked_map_pool/,Rainbow6,2

frftx0,D3adWr0n9P0tat0,Year 5/6 wishlist,"So with a new year and a new season upon us i thought that i share my wishlist for the coming seasons/years.
1. Replacing all ACOGs for Scopes on all DMRs (yes the TCSG and BOSG included)
2. A swap of the holographic sights on some weapons. Why? Well to take the MP5 as a example, I feel like the current holo sight is a bit to wide for the weapon and the same can be said on some other SMGs and a few ARs (the Aug, F2, and the F90 to name 3 ARs that can do with the other holo sight).
3. More love to Terrorist Hunt. Yes R6 is a  prominently a PVP game but especially now T-hunt is more glitched out than it ever was. So from a person with 600+ hours in t-hunt (sorry i enjoy T-hunt more then pvp), devs please give more love to T-hunt and throw in a opinion to turn bombers on and off. And more in terms of rewards for doing T-hunt.

So thats my big 3 wishes for the future of the game. Thoughts? Hell what are your wishes for r6 onward

fre1cf,AuBirdMan,Give Kali Clash’s SPSMG9,"As everyone knows, Kali has been underperforming due to her skill ceiling and that fully automatic weapons will always be superior to a bolt-action sniper rifle. However, Kali is an essential operator to be viable as she is one of the few Thatcher alternatives in the game currently. With how strong a Thatcher ban is in ranked, Kali needs some sort of buff.

In my opinion, the SPSMG9 (currently exclusive the Clash) is the perfect secondary weapon to give to Kali. It has manageable recoil, a solid scope, and isn’t too strong (thanks to it’s limited magazine size). Though, if it turns out that the SPSMG9 is too strong on Kali, the damage could be dropped from 33 to 30 (yes, this would hurt Clash, but I don’t think it’ll be that big of a deal for her).

Giving Kali the SPSMG9 would give her a fighting chance at close quarters and make her a more desirable pick when Tatcher is banned. Other than Kali, there’s only Twitch to take care of gadgets like Bandit and Kaid. Twitch shouldn’t be the only viable option when trying to pick a viable Thatcher alternative.",2,1585518504,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fre1cf/give_kali_clashs_spsmg9/,Rainbow6,2

At level 10 you can access Unranked and at 30 you can play Ranked. These requirements are way to low. The Newcomer playlist is meant to introduce new players to the game and is available from levels 0-50. Why is it then they these players can access Unranked and Ranked at such low levels?

&amp;#x200B;

Players should only have access to Newcomers and Quick Match for levels 0-50, once 50 players can access Unranked. Once the player hit 75 or 100, then you can play Ranked. I know that these sound like very high levels to get access to gain access to the ranked mode but Siege is a very competitive game and making player spend more time in these game modes would allow to get better at the game before they can go into ranked plus smurfs would have to level up an account to 100 to start playing ranked.",5,1585517548,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/frdrlq/a_suggestion_to_help_fight_against_smurf_accounts/,Rainbow6,0

The base game just gets a little boring sometimes and this will maybe make the average number of players on and keep playing siege. Or if that wouldn’t work add an option for custom games to play one of these side gamemodes with your friends.

fr5l6i,kyushu20,Cannot launch the whole game after trying vulkan on PC,"Hi everyone. I bought rainbow six siege on Steam.  
On Friday I decided to try with the vulkan, but I didn't know how to launch it so I go to the folder of R6S and directly click on ""RainbowSix\_Vulkan.exe"", I do not remember very clearly how it went, but I should have launched the game.  
When I tried with it today, it didn't launch the game. With several attempts I went back to Steam trying to launch the game with Steam options, there I could choose DX11 or vulkan version to launch so I thought vulkan should work here and choose vulkan, but it didn't launch the game too. The uplay sync stuff appeared and R6S icon popped in the taskbar for only one second, then disappeared. Ok lets play with DX11 version then, I launched the game with steam choosing DX11, it didn't launch as well acting like vulkan version. 

Usually if the game is launched, attempt to launch the game again in steam should results a notice window about the game is launching. In my situation, the game can be launched again like no game session was launched before.  
I tried to reinstall the game as well as uplay client.

Currently the game cannot be launched in all means.  
Anyone also encountered this? Any help will be appreciated.

fr2q33,K0ZZLES,Current State of the MMR system,"\*IMPORTANT NOTE\* I want to preface this by stating this is a recent support ticket I have emailed to Ubisoft, while I don't expect change or even a reply the more people to spread the word helps. Even though this system I have thought of is not perfect and it has its flaws (some obvious) I believe testing this on the TTS or privately somehow even before done on the TTS would be a valuable learning experience and would better the game in many aspects. I will also say yes I have achieved Platinum multiple times do not attack this idea based on me being Mid Gold which some consider low skill-wise. Also please mind the sometimes poor grammar skills presented before you in this rant. Thank you for taking the time to read this and please evolve on it, share your ideas and experiences with competitive play in Siege and other shooters or even other similarly structured games not just shooters but all competitive play. 

\*ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT PERFECT I INTEND FOR THIS TO START A VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT BRINGING A BETTER RANKED SYSTEM TO THIS GAME\*

Hello Ubisoft, today I am inquiring on the current state of your competitive ranking system. The main point I want to address is the serious disarray of your MMR/ELO system and how it operates. I will give a very real example right now. 

At the beginning of the season, I won 6 and lost 4 of my placements matches. This gave me very high Gold 1, I believe it was around 3190. This would be me 10 away from Platinum 3. I proceeded to play after I got my rank and won the first match, gaining over 103. I then lost two matches in a row. This is the key point of what I want you to take away from this. I lost 100 from both of those losses separately, meaning I lost 200. I then won another match after those two losses. I gained roughly 50. How does losing two matches in a row cut my in-game progress in half permanently for the rest of the season? 

If I wanted to achieve the rank of Diamond the second after I got placed at Gold 1 3190, I would have had to win roughly 13 matches in a row without a loss. This is extremely challenging but with the right team and also be matched with similar skill levelled players is doable, however unlikely. I am currently sitting at Gold 2 2850. I am gaining around 30 per match now. This means I would have to win 54 matches in a row without a single loss to achieve Diamond. Let's say for every loss I win two matches, this still means I would have to win roughly 26 matches. BUT WAIT. I am not taking into account the loss for every two wins. That would significantly drop my gain from 30 to about 10. This makes absolutely no sense at all. 

I would still have to win 38 matches to achieve Diamond from where I am currently standing. I understand it is supposed to be quite a challenge to achieve the higher ranks you have placed within your competitive playlist but it is so unrealistic that it almost defeats the purpose of playing your game in the first place. Why dedicate thousands of hours just to lose two matches in a row and be out of luck for months and permanently screwed until the next season begins in which it will most likely occur once again. 

I implore you to consider changing your system to something like this. Take into account what ranks you are going up against. If you are a Gold, for example, playing against for say a Bronze if you were to win the match you should gain a very low amount. If the roles were reversed and the Bronze won the match, they should gain a very high amount. To further expand upon this simple system I suggest that you also take into account or at least attempt to, the player's individual statistics and how they perform throughout the game, not just wins and losses as it currently seems that you are doing. Let's say you also take into account the player's highest rank they have achieved the current season. What I mean is you would also gain based upon your rank. If you were to derank into a rank bracket you do not belong in, for say a Gold deranked into a Bronze rank. They would have their gain adjusted to avoid people purposely deranking to play against easier (lower) rank brackets. Also, do the same for placement matches which I actually think you do (Taking into account the previous season(s) placement).

I deeply wish that you take the time to read this and forward it to upper management for them to consider serious changes to what many people consider to be a broken game. Thank you.",4,1585470896,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fr2q33/current_state_of_the_mmr_system/,Rainbow6,1

fr1wmd,Kh4rell,Vulkan above 60 Hz," Just wanted to let people know: Be wary about using the new Vulkan API if you're running above 60Hz.

It might seem appealing because you'll gain some FPS, but some of you might not be running your real refresh rate even if it's set to that (be it 75, 80, 120, 144 or 240) in the options and the .ini of the game. 

I'm on fullscreen 144Hz no-Vsync through DP cable, yet after some time going back and forth between Vulkan and DirectX, I noticed that even though the ingame fps counter was going up and down during loadings and gameplay, it was locked at 60 fps in the menu on Vulkan. Moments of action/intensity (or even things as simple as moving my crosshair) were also not feeling as ""smooth"" during gameplay. It was like night and day between the two. After verifying through my monitors OSD fps counter, it appeared I was indeed softlocked in 60 Hz on Vulkan. I checked my settings (In game, Windows and AMD Adrenalin), found no explanation and therefore went back to DirectX but thought I'd let y'all know.

There's a fix thread opened on R6fix that could use some of your contributions if you happen to also run into the same problem and want it fixed. Find it there: [https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-21631-Vulkan\_api\_is\_Capping\_My\_Refresh\_Rate/](https://r6fix.ubi.com/live-server/LIVE-21631-Vulkan_api_is_Capping_My_Refresh_Rate/)

Sidenote: People in Dota 2 and Doom have experienced the same issue without solution, so I begin to think it might just be that Vulkan does not run at 144Hz? But neither Ubi nor the devs of the API specifies that anywhere.

P.S.: Another test or if your monitors OSD doesn't provide an inbuilt fps counter, just allow VSync and put on the fps counter in game then get in T-Hunt and look at the fps counter. It probably won't go above 60.

I read the Rainbow Six book by Tom Clancy and there are so many cool things in it that would work in the game. In the book, there's a skirmish where Rainbow 6 is ambushed at a hospital. Why not add the hospital? I think a shot up, weathered hospital could make a cool, narrow map. Another map idea: the stronghold in South America where the man antagonists planned to hide out. That would be an extremely cool map, a stronghold in the middle of the Amazon with lighting similar to Hereford. And finally, you could add the phone line cutting mechanic from the book . It would be an attack op and their gadget would be a small laptop that they could pull out to hack the nearest cell towers and completely cut comms for the defenders for 5-6 seconds. No push to talk, no chat, no cams, no phone operator abilities. I don't know how they would balance that but I think it would be kinda cool.",0,1585459780,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fr0mp1/suggestion/,Rainbow6,1

fqz9ho,brodiebradley51,New Attacking Operator - Fracture,"*Fracture is a 1 speed, 3 armour operator equipped with 15 Hammerhead Shells, fitted within a Tavor TS12 shotgun, and is focused on achieving A LOT of soft destruction for your team --&gt;*

[Tavor TS12 Shotgun](https://preview.redd.it/c4x4mphi5jp41.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b83cdbf05fa17f37a17a0af6b91077a6002679ac)

*These Hammerhead Shells have a tungsten-plated shell at the end of the cartridge, which creates a shockwave of energy, cracking and eventually crumbling the near wall around it. These can be fired at soft, unreinforced walls. Once connected, it will crack a small area of the surrounding area, which after 0.5s, will crumble away opening a hole in the wall or surface. The hole isn't huge and is the same size as the explosion of 4 hibana pellets if you shoot off the left or right two pellets --&gt;*

[Size of the hole that 1 hammerhead round achieves](https://preview.redd.it/sp7f6obl7jp41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fbd22fa3faa4b386cf64f6b351aa5715909438f)

*This is big enough to create LoS for yourself and over range, while also allowing you to pass through if you were to fire another one below and left enough room to achieve this. This is a skill many players will have to experiment and use well, but this gives you plenty of tools as an attacker.* 

*Considering these are not a projectile in game but work like a bullet with no travel time, and with 15 sounding a lot, i feel i need to justify why this many. This operator will be competing with Buck and Sledge for the role of soft breacher (Ash and Zofia work in other ways), there needs to be an incentive to pick a slower operator, and having A LOT of ranged or close soft destruction is fair in my opinion.* 

*Buck and Sledge excel up close and rightly so, with them offering super strong loadouts also, and not being disadvantaged with speed, i feel its perfectly okay for Fracture to have 15 shells (5 in each barrel, so 15 in total).*

fqyi4z,Starboy2boss,Serious Problem with Ranked/Unranked bans and Nerf's in general.,"Jackal, Monty/Blitz and Cav, leison, echo will never stop getting banned.

The problem with bans right now is that for most people these bans are automatic, no matter how many times you nerf echo he will never not be banned. This is a huge problem which will result in many ops considered annoying to some to become overnerfed. I've already seen so many nerf ideas for ops like echo, jackal based on their ban rate and it's not ok. We cannot nerf ops based on ban rate. Same for we cannot nerf ops based on pickrate .

Ash is the true exception to this rule because the r4c was a broken weapon only used for fragging.
My main topic is jäger. The acog , of course, had to go, there is no denying that. But the most recent nerf, even though it's not significant I'd not ok. Ubi realized jäger is a 99% picked op and their solution was to release an underwhelming ""alternate pick"" The solution would be to buff wamai , you can see how little he is picked.",5,1585450583,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqyi4z/serious_problem_with_rankedunranked_bans_and/,Rainbow6,1

It started just after me and my friend got a party invite from someone on the other team (Conxepxion#7582) after the 2nd round. We left the party because they were just trash talking, and immediately at the start of round 3 it happened.

When it first released, it was stupid strong so I understand the nerfs. However, the way it was nerfed doesn’t make much sense to me. 

They nerfed the damage and significantly increased the recoil. If you miss that first shot, 90% of the time, you’re dead and the damage feels hella inconsistent — I’ve a clip where Cav was no more than 10m in front of me and it took 4 bullets just to down her. 

Can we either increase the damage and leave the recoil as is OR reduce the recoil significantly and either leave the damage as is or reduce it a little more..?

fqvpm1,Quzrealodz,i have lost the ability to aim/kill in this game.,"I have been playing this game for 3 months now, on pc, so i started in operation Shifting Tides, and i am now playing into Operation: Void Edge. I have already suck 700 hours into this game and i consider myself a good player. In my first season, i placed silver 3 and ranked down and played a lot in bronze, and this season, without getting carried i actually made it into Platinum 3, and amazingly i made my k/d from when i had a firm k'd raised it from a 0.6 to a 0.92. This was a couple days ago now, and i'm in high gold 1 and haven't really left it apart from dipping down to gold 2 for one match. I feel like it's not my skill level that's holding me back from doing good but my aim.   


I have recently discovered after multiple matches of what's going wrong is not that i make bad decisions, get snuck up on or even have bad teammates, but it is me and my aim, and less significantly, my movement. I feel i'm constantly being outgunned even when i have the advantage.  I seriously don't know what's wrong and if it's not just a series of bad games/bad days.    


Whilst posting this i do feel that my aim has gotten better than when i felt most angered and frustrated by this negative development. Though i still feel like sh\*t and due to quarantine i can't really do anything else in addition to the fact i,in spite of my difficult experiences, love playing this game.  


In all honestly i'm asking out there if there is someone who has experienced the same and/or there is anyone with any tips?, for this player who's tired of, now, being carried.

fqv4ut,ZooFaceMan,Thatcher's namesake is a very controversial Figure in the UK.,"I understand that this isn't a politics sub and I apologise if this isn't allowed but hear me out.

So for those of you who don't know, the operator Thatcher is named after Margaret Thatcher who was the UK prime minister from 1979 to 1990. To make a very complex and unpleasant story short, her policies lead to a very large proportion of the working class (and basically entire towns and communities) becoming unemployed, something the country has arguably never recovered from.

She also made controversial decisions during the Falklands that lead to a lot of deaths and a pretty unpleasant football world cup game between Argentina and England a few years later.

I don't have stats to back this up but I would say she is one of the most disliked figures in recent British history, to the point where there were street parties across the country when she died in 2013 and Ding Dong the Witch is Dead hit number one. I don't believe in celebrating anybody's death but it's pretty obvious that she's very unpopular. I've only met a couple of people who openly like her and I grew up in a pretty Conservative community (although most of my friends are lefties).

I don't really know of any politicians from other countries who would be equivalent to her so I'm just gonna say it would be like having a Cuban Castro loving character now or a Brazilian Bolsonaro supporter in a game 30 years from now.

So my issue isn't that he's just named after her, it's that he's basically a fanboy of a very ethically questionable person with the lore stating he met her and now his new gun skin even has her name on it.

Now I know this seems petty but it's starting to make me want to not play him because the devs are continuing to make him really strongly affiliated with a person I and many others consider immoral.

Am I being reasonable in saying the devs took it too far or should I just suck it up and get rid of those fookin' laser sites?

Edit: Maybe the Castro comparison is a bit far, it's hard when you're this biased.",33,1585437993,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqv4ut/thatchers_namesake_is_a_very_controversial_figure/,Rainbow6,0

fquir6,UrFriendlyNBHDR6Plat,(serious question) How does BattlEye work and why am I still encountering cheaters?,"I recently played a ranked match on American servers and encountered a group of EU players blatantly hacking. Obviously we lost the game and are forced to hope that the cheaters get banned and we get our mmr back.

However, with a game that's as old and successful as Siege, why am I still running into players like this? What exactly is BattlEye doing to stop this? It seems like BattlEye is almost an afterthought in the sense that AFTER I report the players I get a message days later saying the mmr was reversed due to cheaters.

Which brings up another question: Why can't Ubisoft pool their resources and focus more on not letting cheaters play the game in the first place?

Even though reversing mmr due to cheaters is supposed to be a good thing, I feel that it is a complete waste of time and discourages me from wanting to play the game further. I've lost around 300 mmr alone this season due to reversed mmr and while I get that they're ""canceling out that match,"" those players never should have made it in to the game to begin with. That way, I wouldn't be wasting my time and losing mmr and getting pissed off at this frustrating system.

 I remember I had my friends over and we'd reenact the trailer with nerf guns and used a pillow as the hostage. The only problem is I didn't have a console to play it on so eventually I lost interest and forgot about the game.

Flash forward 6 years and I buy this game. What the fuck happened?

Bright unrealistic skins, stupid overwatch operators, no terrorists, toned down destruction, I mean this is nothing like the game they originally showed.

I mean with that new Pizza Skin and the Battlepass it's basically Fortnite now.

I mean what happened to that SWAT vs Terrorist theme they showed off before! This is such a dissapointment and to think this is a Tom Clancy Game, no fucking way.

fqsxzo,m0nday_,Dear Developers...,"It'll be hard for anyone to convince me: the team behind Rainbow Six Siege is one of the worst I have ever seen.

I want to love this game **so** bad. I really do. I love the concept. It's unique and you can't get the same experience from any other game. But I simply can't remember a time where I wasn't plagued by constant, game-breaking bugs. It is what has caused me to go in and out of this game for 3 years.

I understand, to an extent, that the devs work hard. But there are bugs in the game that have been in there for **years. Without acknowledgment.**

Want proof? Here's a reddit thread from **a year ago** that shows the exact bug I am currently having in this game:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8h0aeu/bug\_essential\_audio\_cut\_out\_mid\_game\_no\_footsteps/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/8h0aeu/bug_essential_audio_cut_out_mid_game_no_footsteps/) 

Okay, so maybe a year isn't that bad. To me, that's unacceptable. But maybe a year isn't bad to you. But here is a steam thread that was...guess it...posted **FOUR YEARS AGO:**  [https://steamcommunity.com/app/359550/discussions/1/1607148447818151041/](https://steamcommunity.com/app/359550/discussions/1/1607148447818151041/) 

And you know what makes it worse? **Ubisoft developers directly responded to this thread. The developers acknowledged the existence of this bug, and did nothing. It has been in the game for four years.** 

This is just one of many examples of bugs that have been plaguing this game since release. I don't know whether it's the design of the game, but this game seems to always have bugs. It's why I always end up returning to CS:GO - Valve has perfected the competitive FPS genre. It's clean. It's sharp. And most importantly: it's not known for having bugs. When I look at Rainbow Six Siege this is what I see: a game where you have to compromise and accept it's flaws to love it. Perhaps that isn't such a bad thing, but the performance of the developers is truly affecting my experience to where, many times, I wish I never bought the game in the first place.

fqs4wr,Dantegram,Rainbow six Quarantine,"Rainbow six quarantine is coming. This year, if Corona doesn't slow it down too much. And I've had plenty of time to play siege while holed away. And one thought that came to me was what the rules of war were when it comes to siege. Specifically, what weapons are banned. In siege, I believe it is implied to be a training situation of 5 operators v 5 operators. Therefore, what they can use is limited. But even if they were real weapons, they wouldn't change much. What would change is if we are dealing with aliens. Specifically, aliens that cannot be reasoned with or contained. My hope is that Ubisoft realizes this and puts other weapons in. Ones normally not allowed in war. Because we could be seeing some very interesting operators (assuming they use them) if they decide to throw those rules away for the sake of taking down aliens. Flamethrowers, IED's, cluster bombs, poison gas, lasers, things that aren't allowed could finally be used. It's also been several years ahead in the timeline of Siege, they must have some new stuff to kill with. The possibilities for new operators is suddenly much higher than it was in Siege.

fqrmi3,Sraucel,Plz Increase Leaver Penalties,"You don't know how many games I've queued into where someone leaves and it becomes a 4 vs 5, this most likely results in a loss.

I truly believe a 15 minute penalty isn't gonna cut it, as some ppl just simply get off for the night or some playing the game for the entire day. The basically fucks up the 4 players on your team, as well as yourself.

I truly believe a leave should be a 48-72 hour ban. Ppl who leave need to be punished accordingly and not being able to play for 2-3 days; a 15 minute ban is way too short. The next thing is that IF THE OTHER 4 PLAYERS IN YOUR TEAM ARE NOT IN A SQUAD WITH THE LEAVER (So it can't be abused) then they lose 75% less elo and the enemy team gains 75% less elo. If they are in a squad, they still lose the same amount of elo. Now onto the Q and A

Q :WHAT IF THE PERSON NEEDS TO LEAVE FOR AN EMERGENCY???? Well in this case whatever, but how many times is this going to happen???

Q : WHAT IF SOMEONE HAS BAD INTERNET???? Well there's a difference between being disconnected and actually PRESSING the leave game button. Ubisoft could make a program to differentiate between these two things.",10,1585426598,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqrmi3/plz_increase_leaver_penalties/,Rainbow6,1

I'm also playing at ping that ranges at the lowest at 50 to the highest at 300. The ping has been like this before the virus so it cant be server stress due to the new demand of players on here. Have they moved the servers at all? Because every other season I've played smoothly, it also seems most players have the amount of lag too. 

The game just isn't running smoothly at all, its not enjoyable and now where i should be plat, like my other teammates ive dropped all the way down to silver because i decided to solo que and my game crashes.

fqqksd,Curry4Splash,Leaver penalty,"Since the start of the season, I’ve seen an increasing amount of leavers in ranked and unranked matches. I think the current penalty for leaving a match is an absolute joke and isnt effective. Ubisoft should try to implement harsher punishments. One solution could be to implement a system like in overwatch. After repeatedly leaving marches, the player will be banned and then have to complete 5 FULL games without receiving any exp or renown once his ban period is over. While this is not perfect it would help deter leavers. We could also increase the 30 minute ban timer to something more relevant like a few hours. While this will penalize players who disconnect involuntarily and aren’t able to reconnect on the short term, it will only affect toxic players on the long term.",2,1585423275,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqqksd/leaver_penalty/,Rainbow6,2

So recently I’ve been looking for a team to join on rainbow. I found a team that I applied for and they liked so I joined discord and they had a scrim lined up. We dry ran defence strats on coastline for 10 minutes and we headed to the scrim. So I main support/flex but they put me on entry fragging because they hadn’t even told their support he was going to be dropped and they asked me not to tell him.( I thought this was a bit childish and stupid) so we play attack first on Kafe in the scrim. After the first round where I died because piano wasn’t droned in properly they started to give up and say that they had no strats for kafe so the scrim was pointless. Then they all left round 2 and I got benched so they could try out other entries. I then just left the discord since I did not want to be associated with that kind of mentality.

fqpyh9,noogiebights,A thought/suggestion: Standardize enemy cosmetics option,"I'm not new to the game by most other metrics (sub-60 hours) but I still feel like there's an ocean of depth that I haven't learned. I'm a professional User Experience designer and one of the things good design aims to be is intuitive. One of the things I still struggle with intuiting is calling out enemy operators consistently, and I think part of the reason is the cosmetics. On lower settings, it can be difficult to distinguish between the silhouettes of Rook/Doc, Vigil/Smoke, and others that use similar color schemes on certain cosmetics. The Outbreak headgear is especially egregious here, as it makes every operator look at a cursory glance like Lion.

A game that has almost no similarity in gameplay, but a similar visual issue is Guild Wars 2's PVP: there's 3 armor classes shared between 9 classes, so at a glance it's super difficult to tell if you're going up against a tanky Necromancer or a bursty Elementalist. Or an up-close Thief or a bunkery Engineer. But GW2 has an option to standardize all enemy cosmetics such that you know exactly what you're looking at, and there's no mind-games with making your character look like another.

As Siege ages, and cosmetics get objectively more and more broad and therefore overlaps in silhouettes and color schemes occur, I theorize that it's actually essential to the onboarding of newer players and the consistent return of seasonal comers-back that Siege include an option to just standardize the armor/headgear cosmetics of all enemies (maybe allies but I think that's less essential).

What do you guys think? Am I asking for too much, or do you agree that this option would help people affinitize to the game better?",10,1585421281,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqpyh9/a_thoughtsuggestion_standardize_enemy_cosmetics/,Rainbow6,1

I usually play without my friends cuz they're busy but anyways I find it really frustrating to play with toxic people. For instance, once I was playing unranked and I just commented 'lol' and someone started flaming me for having 0 kills despite me trying to give intel to the team (and he did this every round). That dude cursed a lot, and said really nasty things like asking me to jump off a window. It didnt bother me as much but when we kept losing cuz they tk each other almost every time the round starts I find it really hard to enjoy the game. Another time was when I was just playing normally (highest score but with like 3 pistol kills only) and dude just tk me. Like, I didnt even say or do anything and it was freaking CASUAL.  

ok my point is that, if I were to meet toxic people again, how can I enjoy the game? my approach is to ignore them but sometimes it's not easy to clutch a 1v5, especially with my potato skills :/

For example: grenades, stuns, impacts, nitro cells, any gadget that can be thrown with one hand. This includes any operator ability that can be used with one hand. Maybe even use something like a pistol too, but just with much more recoil because the operator will only have one hand to control it (the pistol is a stretch because it could have less benefit to the game then it would add).",6,1585415688,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqo6xe/am_i_the_only_one_who_thinks_we_should_be_able_to/,Rainbow6,0

fqnp0q,Bahar_Bear,"Griefing, Vote Kick immunity and other things I know we cant do anything about.","So, I know it's highly unlikely anything can be done. This is also just another 'I kinda dont like this' about the game so if youre not interested, or if you are one of these people, please just  move on.

I understand theres been talks of removing vote kick from Casual gameplay, as its been used mostly to grief than anything else. It was only the other day, i played in two games where the enamy team where openly joking in ALLCHAT that they had vote kicked the last 4 players that joined thier team. Overall it made the game a little... Meh.

Truth is, Like many people, im an Adult with a pretty busy life. Ive not palyed ranked since i started my new job 2 and a half years ago, and i rarely have time nor want for it. Unranked usually takes too long for a two or three games i get to sqeeze in. So casual is the place i play. (Filthy casual scrub i know, how dare i have an opinion.)

Regaurdless, Whats my issue? Well, Lets  talk about those groups of 3-4... sometimes 2's that join a casual game, TK your palyers say 'oops accident, sorry lol' in their 15 year old voices and are then totally Immune to being vote kicked becuase of their buddies. You know the people im talking about.

What could possibly be done to prevent this? Maybe if each member of a squad TK's theyre now exempt from a vote kick, So they cant protect themselves. Im aware sometimes you haev that rouge buddy, that does TK and it snothing to do with you, so i suppose it would be a cause and effect thing.

I'm aware, although its not an 'Every game occurance' it is atleast a 1 in 3 that eaither our team or the enemy team suffer this. Couple this with the long load times when new poeple join mid match, plus the genernal report system not working at all... casual, and this game in general, becomes a bore. If i was here to fight half a team, id play private, if i was here to watch some smurfs play like gods with thier buddies only, ill watch more pro leauge.

It is somthing ive been able to ignore for a long time, i just suppose today, with the ammount of children off school, (stay safe) this is going to be a reoccuring thing. But Ubi, I dont quite know what im asking, but i am asking, There has to be a better way to deal with this.

I dont care about my WL, nor my KD, nor my skill nor rank, nor really anything other than just having a good fight and good compettition, this seems to destroy that. Countless times ive seen enemy teams complain that a team has TK'd 2-3 players before they get to us becuase thats no what theyre here for...

Its just, bad sportsmanship.

Appologies for a useless rant, I suppose. I got work to do. Wash your hands, stay safe.",1,1585414066,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqnp0q/griefing_vote_kick_immunity_and_other_things_i/,Rainbow6,1

Other priorities: in order to trigger his camouflage, camilion has to snap his fingers, this is so that people will be able to tell he entered camouflage, and have a chance to find him, IQ can also spot him when he's disguised, finally, camilion has to stand still to trigger his gadget.

fqkvq9,GovindSinghNarula,I need help with this game.,"Okay you know what? The troubles and bugs in what is otherwise a great game are becoming too much. I have just been banned for 2 hours for leaving a match and this is complete nonsense. I had connection issues and so I got disconnected. Once a connection was established I was given an option of coming back to the game and so I went back into unranked. Except when I tried to it said error: could not join the match. I restarted the game and the option never came back and so I cued up for another match. In the middle of the match while I was in a fight I got the popup saying m temporary banned for 2 hours which not only got me killed but it's not even my fault. This is the second time this has happened to me and this is getting on my nerves. Random crashes and connection issues (on my wifi which is working great for literally every other multiplayer game) are becoming way too much. Reaping quickly because this is really discouraging me from playing rainbow, and I just bought the battle pass.

on top of that chat isnt working. i would just like to talk to someone from support, i can't wait for 2 weeks for the reply to come as usual as if i get banned again the time that i am sanctioned for would only increase.

&amp;#x200B;

someone please help me with this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

i am also experiencing alt+f4, like i crash to the desktop without any error message as i closed the game manually. this happens in the middle of matches too, this is also an issue so please if someone has fixes for any of the issues above notify me, it would a great help.

But now, on PC, where my specs are actually a bit better then what they recommend on Steam, my game will freeze-crash my PC. 

It only started yesterday, I was in the middle of a match and boom, game froze, sound slightly cut out, came back, then died. PC fully reset. I was a little confused so I decided to verify game files as that usually fixes things, did that, same thing happened again. And this has been happening every time I've tried to play siege. I run my game on Medium as my games a little chunky on certain maps so I like to keep the FPS up.

I have fiddled with the settings to no end and nothing, so, I'm think to uninstall.

      Mouse Flicks in random direction and feels like it disconects

      Hi. Recently (about a week ago) my geforce now started having some issues. Last sunday I bought Rainbow Six Siege, I was hyped to play, just to notice that my mouse randomly flicks in one direction or it just ""disconects"" and my character aims and shoots randomly. At first I thought it's my mouse (I actually bought a new one) but the problem consisted. This happens in Leauge of Legends too, my mouse randomly goes in one direction, only when using NG. Did this happen to any of you? I contacted support but yeah, Nvidia's support isn't the greatest. They just told me to switch networks, but the problem is still there, and it's beginning to be unplayable. I am a founder (idk if that's relevant) but still.

my internet connection is quite good and before this week everything was fine!

If any of you guys here are using Geforce Now to play siege and run into this, some help?

What is the point of that'?,"I have been playing exactly 1 day. I was in a match and a teammate wounded me at the start on purpose then healed me so I got back up at 20 health. Other than being a dick, what exactly is the point of doing that? I mean why didn't he just kill me outright if he wanted to grief? We ended up with a heartbreaking defeat match. Does he get points for healing me or I don't get it. These guy did it to me in a match later too about the same way. Both times one turn 5 of the match making itt really sting because of my time wasted. If it was turn 1 yeah I would just leave no big deal.

Also in newcomer everyone seems to be a elite gamer pro. I don't get the matchmaking in this game. I have only been playing one day still trying to figure out the maps. Is there a novice mode where only brand new players will ever play?",3,1585392470,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqhw0t/playing_newcomer_a_teammate_intentionally_wounds/,Rainbow6,1

fqhl63,Alexmazy,Purpose of levels?,"Literally, once you surpass the level to be able to play ranked as far as I can see levels have literally no purpose apart from to show how experienced you are and to cause discrimination to newer players in ranked. I mean in other games you unlock things like extra attachments for guns, skins etc. In this game, you just level up, and that's it! Wow, I was level 67 and now I'm level 68! Not like anybody cares.

So I'm gonna offer some of my ideas which I think would make levels actually worthwhile and levelling up like an accomplishment.

1. Every time you level up you earn 100% extra renown on the match you had just finished or alternatively you earn an extra 250 renown as if you had completed a weekly challenge.
2. Every 10 levels (Level 10, 20, 30, etc,) you earn an alpha pack. This would make it exciting to level up and make it interesting and fun.
3. Add certain skins for certain weapons. Oh wow! You just made it to level 100 here is an exclusive skin for \[insert gun\] that you can't get anywhere else?

Anyway, that's just my opinion on it anyway. If I have missed something major I apologies.

ps: Ubisoft stop giving me shite alpha pack common uniforms which are the exact same as the normal skin but instead of being grey is black

pps: Fix vote kick abuse, please. Every 5/6 matches I get vote kicked out for no reason.",8,1585391158,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqhl63/purpose_of_levels/,Rainbow6,1

fqdncr,kyleisawesome725,Arcade Idea,"So recently we had the introduction of the Arcade mode into rainbow and it has made me wonder what Ubi and the devs would do as other game modes? I was thinking that an amazing and fun one would be called Throwback Thursday. This game mode would consist of them reintroducing almost all of the things the one gave to the operators. This would of course include Ash, Jager, Bandit, Maestro, and SMG 11 acogs back. This would also include switching up the load outs of other operators, like Nomad getting her claymore back, or Ela getting impacts back, bandit having 3 barbed wire, Kaid having C4 or Impacts, the list can go on. I believe that it could really bring back a sense nostalgia for some of the older players and make a fun game mode. It of course isn’t enough content to do a full event but arcade would be perfect.

The game mode would be only available for three Thursdays (maybe into Fridays even though that beats the purpose of the name) and each week it would be played on a different map. Week one could be old Kanal, week two could be old Kafe, and week three could bring back the OG Hereford base to top it off.

I would love to get people’s opinions on this and what else they could add back to operators. Ubi has changed so many of these operators load outs throughout the years and it’s difficult to remember them all!",2,1585371184,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fqdncr/arcade_idea/,Rainbow6,1

What was that?”, mozzie starts to try to hack my drones, and the other guy shoots all the walls and the hostage, mozzie still trying to hack my drones “wtf why can’t I hack them”, I then Say “ah it’s gonna be one of those games huh”, they proceed to knock me down and respond with the typical “sorry trying to shoot the drones”, we lose the round.

On attack we rush and manage to kill most of the enemy, the hostage was shot and knocked down, the plat is sitting next to the dying hostage, I’m roaming around the area to make sure he doesn’t get shot and we can revive the hostage, they proceed to start screaming at me because I’m not reviving the hostage and the plat clearly sitting next to the hostage being an troll let’s him die.

Next round we get the hostage, the plat is escorting the hostage aaaaaannnnddd he’s just taking him around the building not even trying to take him outside, I manage to find the last enemy and win the game, of course this makes them mad and call me an idiot.

I really hope the new “reputation system” fixes these matchmaking issues so I can avoid these trolls.

fqbuef,davidcat4,Warden buff idea. (been playing him for awhile to see if he can benefit) (hope people read this),"Warden has one of the lowest pick rates as is stated in the win delta. I can't see the point in bringing warden when I have smoke/mute who has a way better gun (smg11+M590A1 combo vs smg12 + M590A1 combo) and utility in denying a whole push for plant. I could never imagine warden as a roamer. I feel like he is best played on site where all the enemy utility such as smokes and flash bangs are use for a bomb push. Maybe a lurker but still he was originally design for anchor plays since he was originally 3 Armour and 1 speed. Even in my team rank games I see warden as a troll pick when we are snowballing the enemy and not on site anchoring but roaming. More troll pick than my turret lord himself. Actually the LORD is decent cos of that shield.

Let's talk about Warden weapons for a sec. I don't know many good players that can run smg 12 for warden with good tapping control or even full auto. But then you might say pros can do it. But not everyone is a pro like only 5% or even less. While all of us is a regular Joe.  Any regular Joe could definitely practice smg 11. I play with plats and diamonds and I see smg11 as viable choice for clicking heads. Never do I see smg 12 ever used.This forces majority of the players on warden to play mpx instead of M590A1 as we all know head shots is key in the game and anything automatic is nice to have. 

You could run P-10C combo with M590A1  for warden but  you lose the  automatic choice and you could be in a huge disadvantage to run P-10C in some gun fights. Warden ability is mediocre and selfish if he dies with an mpx. If he brings the M590A1 he benefited the team in making rotation holes and etc but then the secondary choice  aren't as viable as a smoke main for clicking heads. The only use warden has is to deal with the whole ying or blitz or glaz shenanigans and etc. Thus mpx is good for gunning these operators down. But if enemy team doesn't bring any of that it makes Warden a ""recruit"" with a good gun. Warden only BRINGS the mind game of fear of picking ying, glaz or blitz and etc rendering enemy strats. And even still the enemy would still bring ying, glaz or blitz and etc even if you are playing warden to be honest for one simple reason. Warden ability puts you at a disadvantage.

Let's talk about Warden utility. Warden can't throw a smoke to choke of enemy for 10 sec and SMOKE can do this safely behind cover. Warden has to expose himself making him vulnerable when enemy is planting and another one is probably guarding his buddy and very likely the plant will go off. Best case scenario is you kill enemy planting and his buddy when smoke and flash and etc went off. You did your job as you stop plant. Next best scenario is you kill both of them but plant goes off you still did your job. Another scenario is you trade but the planter is still planting kinda bad but you did something. Worst case scenario you lose the fight as  ya had no choice to put yourself at risk and plant goes off. If one of them gets out of there alive while plant goes off is VERY BAD. Every time that happens my team blames me for not bringing smoke as we lose. 

However coordinating attacks with warden and smoke together is quite successful for stopping plant. With warden being more aggressive with laying down fire and smoke more defensive throwing out his smoke to kill of enemy and create ""sight"" for warden ability. However we can only bring 5 operators. So is not a worthwhile choice to have these 2 working side to side when we need other roles to play as smoke himself can hold the line himself.

So how can we make warden less of a recruit and more inline of an operator? As warden is a selfish pick. I am sorry for my rank team mates for picking warden completely last season and being noting but baggage. 

1) make weapons viable that is one option. It would be nice but I get it that they don't want to buff dokka/vigil too much. I understand the argument for having the nice acog for p90 too but let's be honest its his base weapons kit that needs the push in the right direction. I have also heard of the argument that warden could also get smoke nades but assume warden dies the smoke could be more of a detriment to defenders.  

2) Make warden ability drop (a few ) glasses like rook armor letting the 5 operator choose who to have those glasses. Warden gets to activate the ability for the members (maybe 2 only and himself) of the team when call out is heard (obviously people without a mic is at a disadvantage but hey is a team based game with tactics). And can only activate if warden is still alive. Thus forcing warden to stay alive as long as possible so he can rival with smoke. As all I see is roaming or flanking Wardens in rank for troll reasons lol. What I am suggesting is to make warden a more team based gadget then a solo pick for himself. As if anyone wanted a solo gadget for stopping attackers plant simply pick smoke. This will also make warden make defending teams choose him for a take back of site for a more aggression coordinated plays. Of course warden ability will still be on timer so he isn't broken.  As currently there is no reason to pick Warden when smoke does a better job.

3) And of course the standing still penalty should be tweak  as when flash and smoke is coming at you. As a lot of gun fights standing still is a death sentence.

fqar56,static-defender,Fixing up Ranked a bit,"(my last post was flawed greatly so I deleted it  and now here’s my new idea)


One problem that I and many others face in ranked when we solo-queue are disconnections.  I feel that this is one main reason I dropped from high silver and is another reason I cannot rank up. Siege is a team-based game so if you don’t have a full team, you have less of a chance winning. 


Possible solution: If your teammate disconnects from your ranked game in the first 2 matches, your elo loss will not be counted. Ranked points also should differ by how hard you fought. If you lose 4-5 you should have a lower point loss whereas if you loss 0-3 you would have a greater point loss.

If possible for console (I know PC can tilt with ADS) but making it when she tilts and tosses it the clone copies her movement. They could even make it drop on her location if pressed and if held be able to be tossed.

For her passive I think the run-out spotting mechanic isn’t used every especially in higher ranks and does nothing but hide your allies ID and alert the enemy of an existing alibi as well... instead I’m thinking make her passive allow for no ping’s which will protect your team from being ID by an enemy.

A less oppressive option could be allow her holograms to be pinged too, it wouldn’t be oppressive since the base still exists but allows for more trickery.",3,1585349198,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq7pho/alibi_buff_prisma_and_passive_changes/,Rainbow6,1

fq5fzd,TacticlTaco,Uplay Taking up a lot of CPU,"I have a question about Uplay running as a background process while I'm playing Rainbow Six. So I've been trying to fix problems with stuttering during mouse movements and I know that it isn't my mouse and it isn't my internet, so I know my pc is having trouble running siege smoothly for some reason. After at least 2 weeks of trying different things from Ubisoft support I found this in my task manager today. Does anybody know if this is normal, because I'm pretty sure it didn't do that at least a few months ago. I was pretty sure Uplay isn't supposed to take up that much of my CPU(i5 6700k). If anybody has anymore questions they need answered about the problem or has any ideas or suggestions they could help me with, it would be very appreciated.(I don't know why it says 100 as i took the screenshot, but when my game is running it says around 85% to 86% .)

fq47e8,An_Angry_Puppy,Outback is kind of boring to play... and predictable.,"I feel like Outback is all based around the bull room. The attackers almost always end up going through there sooner or later and it makes the game pretty predictable. Say you're playing the Office/Party Room site. One person is guaranteed to push the bull from shark, and one from games. the same goes for the Laundry/Games site. One person will come through the Office door and one from shark. It happens every game. This is why I say Bull is the problem with this map. And I have a fix.

The Patio. If they were to push the staircase on the patio further out, then enclose that patio. Make a door where the window is into shark is, then make a soft wall and a balcony with a staircase to make an almost guaranteed way that the attackers could get in. Then that would give the attackers completely legitimate ways to push from that whole side of the map. Maybe move the door more to the side so you can't hold an angle from shark stairs. By enclosing the patio, it enables the attackers to feel more free in pushing site. It also fixes the problem attackers have with shark window with people playing it and trying for free kills on people coming up the staircase.

The criticism being... why are the descriptions for Battlepass charms and the like so bad? They have no personality, as you can tell they're all written by the same person, which is a shame since they're supposed to be insights into each operator's mind. 

Not only that, but to me at least, they come across as incredibly pretentious, spouting off what I can only describe as shallow philosophy, especially when it came to Harry's items, which seemed to depict little more than self-congratulatory masturbation. 

Overall, the descriptions don't bother me all that much, but I do find it a tad annoying when it involves content that players are expected to pay for. Seems to me they'd put more effort into these sorts of intricate details. 

So what do you guys think? Valid criticism, or am I nitpicking far too much for this type of game?",0,1585337572,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq3v5m/battlepass_descriptions/,Rainbow6,2

fq3l08,BlackKnight6660,The Canon of Rainbow 6: Siege,"I don’t know how much of this is common knowledge but it wasn’t until recently that it became apparent to me and, with a little more digging, I hit a goldmine of R6 canon specifically surrounding the operators. 

So here it is: Some of the operators are actually based off of real life people, so much so that their characters ARE actually the people from real life. 

Thatcher and Sledge: 

Thatcher and Sledge are both based off of real life SAS soldiers, specifically the ones that responded to the Iranian embassy siege in London (1980). 

Sledge is based off of the first person to breach the building, who did so with flashbangs and a sledge hammer. The Ubisoft team mentioned that they found this so inspiring they made him into a character in the game. 

Thatcher was also there, in fact if you google [this real photo ](https://i.redd.it/q1vfi1uk45831.jpg) the middle SAS operator is confirmed to have been Thatcher. This is also reinforced (heh... R6 pun) by his [elite skin ](https://imgur.com/ocrboMi) in which you can clearly see a medal resembling the [real medal](https://imgur.com/F10OITx) which was given to the SAS troops who helped with the Iranian Embassy hostage situation. 

Montaigne (AKA Mountain) is once again based off of a real soldier during a real hostage situation in which a siege was necessary, the 1994 Air France Flight to be exact. In which the first to breach the plane head on was carrying a pistol and a riot shield and took shotgun shells, grenade blasts and several other heavy hits and kept on moving. Riot shields at the time weren’t designed to absorb heavy blows like that and yet a mixture of his shield, his helmet and his protective body armor managed to absorb hit after hit after hit. After the events, his fellow soldiers nominated him the nickname (and future callsign) Montaigne, The Montain, for his “immovable stature” during the siege. 

There are several other real life people and events that influenced the creation of Iconic operators like Fuze, Maverick and Glaz but what’s so cool about these ones is that they’re the real thing. Their ingame characters are also the people who fought in these situations.",2,1585336752,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq3l08/the_canon_of_rainbow_6_siege/,Rainbow6,2

  My preferred weapons are high ROF-low recoil ones like the MP5, P10 Roni or Commando 9(If that's 680RPM is considered high). I was a Mira main just days ago so I can handle a bit of recoil.

fq2ywx,brodiebradley51,Ways To Solve The Meta Conundrum At Pro Play (Feedback),"**--Mozzie/Mute Combo--**

*This combo is really strong at the moment, with so much denial of intel slowing down the attack so much. There are some changes that can occur to help counter to combo --&gt;*

**Twitch**

* *Twitch Drone Audio when moving lowered by 20%, making it more quiet overall*
* *Cooldown of her tasers lowered to 25s (from 30s)*
* *F2 loses ACOG*
* *F2 damage lowered to 34 (from 37)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Mute -** *personally i feel wrong making changes to Mute but i feel this proposal is at least fair, and alleviates some of the frustration with the combo:*

* *Now has a total of 3 jammers; Loses one so down from 4.*
* *Jammers can now disable Airjabs and Claymore's that fall within its AoE giving them an additional benefit to just drone denial which has always made mute a versatile.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Mozzie**

* *Twitch's shock drone can now zap and destroy the pest when in the hacking animation, making the shock drone the hard counter, over being the other way around*

&amp;#x200B;

**--Physical Utility - Castle Barricades, Goyo Shield, Maestro Cams etc--**

**Kali**

* *Her lance can now explode and bust the canister on Mira Windows, considering it burrows in and explodes on both sides.*
* *Gains 4th LV Explosive Lance (up from 3), to help her better deal with utility.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Fuze**

* *His cluster grenades now have a magnetic pull to them, allowing them to stick and cling to any equipment a puck passes by (within 5m), to allow him to better deal with utility overall*
* *Can now place his cluster charge on reinforced surfaces BUT the deployment time is doubled, and there would be a new clear audio cue*
* *Explosive Yield against enemies lowered by 50%, but better helps against gadgets so this is a fair trade-off i feel, and would still give them potency*

&amp;#x200B;

**New Equipment Option - Micro-Sticky Grenades**

*This is a new secondary equipment choice for some attackers, which yield good damage against gadgets but deal low damage to players, focusing them on gadget removal over player damage.*

*They'd deal a max of 30 damage against enemies at the closest ranges, which is low considering an impact on defence can deal around 50 damage when close. The pros are that it sticks and therefore excels at gadget removal. It has an explosive radius of 3m, which is standard for most grenade-like gadgets. The Grenades would also have a relatively low destruction yield with holes being opened but not big enough to pass through, so they can be used to create lines of sight.*

*They'd get two of these, and will be handed out to 6 attackers --&gt;*

**IQ**

* *Gains Micro-Sticky Grenades; Replaces Claymore*
* *Scanner Range reduced to 7m, to compensate for this helpful buff*
* *Once scanner is put away, there is a 3s cooldown before using it again*

**Gridlock**

* *Gains Micro-Sticky Grenades; Replaces Breaching Charges*

**Iana**

* *Gains Micro-Sticky Grenades; Replaces Frag Grenades*
* *Duration of her Gemini Hologram lowered to 12s (from 15s)*

**Buck + Sledge**

* *Gains Micro-Sticky Grenades; Replaces Stun Grenades*

**Lion**

* *Gains Micro-Sticky Grenades; Replaces Claymore*

*These additions are given to ops that are already fairly strong, allowing them to shuffle in and out of team compositions more easily, instead of giving them to ops far removed from being considered for a team composition at a pro level.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Sledge + Maverick**

* *Destroying Goyo Shields with their gadgets no longer explodes the shields, instead collapsing them with no triggered effects like a regular deployable shield.*

&amp;#x200B;

**--Camera Utility - Valkyrie cams, Echo drones etc--**

**All Cameras/Drones on Defence**

* *Once the operator who brings that specific camera has been eliminated, the cameras get locked into place and can only see where it was looking before they died. This limits the impact of these after that operator is removed.*

**Echo**

* *Time before cloaking, once adhered to the ceiling, increased by 1s*
* *Time before cloaking, after firing sonic burst, increased by 1s*
* *Audio of Echo drone reversed; Quieter when moving across the ground and louder when on the ceiling cloaked.*
* *Both echo drone share a pool of sonic bursts which is 2, and they recharge like normal. This means both drones together have 2 bursts, not 2 per drone. This limits its impact overall.*

**Maestro**

* *Alda 5.56 magazine size lowered to 65 (from 80)*

&amp;#x200B;

**--Other Changes--**

**Impact Grenades**

* *Destruction radius lowered to 1m (from 3m), while keeping the damage radius the same. This limits the potential to impact trick, while keeping impacts great for destruction like they should have always been.*

&amp;#x200B;

**--Other Thoughts--**

*I need to also say this. At pro play, these concerns are completely justified as defence do have a lot more utility than gadgets attackers have to deal with it. However, at any level below that, People who use ops like IQ, Twitch, Ash etc who dont use their gadgets or dont use them well have no right to complain. There are so many of these players who use them for the weapon only, and then moan about utility when they die.*

*If people eased up on berating people for suggesting weapon nerfs and gadget buffs for a lot of these types of operator, you'd have less issues. However, people will moan and then continue to play the same way and exacerbating the issues.*

*Allow the devs to properly change the ops and the game will be in a better spot, however i doubt many will want that unfortunately. I am not placing the blame on one individual but most of the community as a whole, and we are all guilty of it. The truth hurts, but needs to be said!*

&amp;#x200B;

*What do you think? I feel this overall puts the meta and the game into a better state alleviating the frustrations from a lot of the strong meta's currently, while not rendering any of these operators too strong or too weak afterwards.*",0,1585334984,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq2ywx/ways_to_solve_the_meta_conundrum_at_pro_play/,Rainbow6,0

fq2stt,Ziiplik,The way Operation: Void Edge is going....(RANT),"It makes me wish for Operation Health 2.0

The sound in this game seems like its getting worse and worse every season. Enemies sound like they're right on top of me, when they are on the totally opposite side of the map.

Hit registration also seems like it got nerfed, to the point where all my enemies are Ash and I'm Montagne without a shield. 

The oregon rework was extremely uncalled for. Its worse than the meme park rework IMO. I'm spending a lot more time checking my corners, searching for roamers than EVER before (not saying that's not part of the game, no other map is more corner/roamer oriented  than oregon right now). 

My thoughts, not the best but would love feedback/additions to why You're frustrated with how this OP is going.",4,1585334493,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq2stt/the_way_operation_void_edge_is_goingrant/,Rainbow6,1

Since 15th March when i got banned i am waiting for answer, i really want them to look into my case properly if there was a program or anything interrupting the game which isn’t the case here.
Live chat is useless and this person just copy pasted about some conduct.
I have 530 hours on the game never used a cheat even bought year pass days before ban. Is there any chance of getting unbanned or anyone that could help me, i start the game everyday to see if the ban didn’t disappear because i still can’t believe that it happend. No one is answering my ticket and even if they will answer eventually in the future they won’t look at my case properly. Has anyone else been banned like this do i have chance?

fq21vl,Maxinik03,Arguments why Tachanka's elite should be a Doom Slayer crossover.,"I have made a small list of things indicating how Tachanka resembles Doom Slayer and therefore would be an amazing operator to have his elite as the Doom Slayer.

1. A badass voice.
2. After Tachanka gets reworked, he will get both a powerful machine gun capable of easily punching through walls **AND** an incendary grenade launcher. We do have operators that carry three factual weapons(e.g. Buck, Zofia, Ash), but i don't think they are reaching the same firepower of reworked Tachanka. Both the Doom Slayer and Tachanka will pack an arsenal with unmatching firepower.
3. A badass helmet. There's been some cool face-covering helmets since Siege's launch(mainly Vigil), but Tachanka stays brutal with only his eye slit on his visor, staying cold-blooded. Slayer's visor is see-through though, but it's still badass since you don't see his face most of the time anyway.

That's about it. I know a crossover between Ubi and ID Software(well, Bethesda) is unlikely, but since we got ourselves a Tomb Raider Ash out of literally nowhere, maybe now is the time to use our imagination.",7,1585332350,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fq21vl/arguments_why_tachankas_elite_should_be_a_doom/,Rainbow6,0

I'm Milosh and i've been casting R6 Pro league since May of 2017, and Rainbow 6 in general since December of 2016.

I joined in R6 after playing the Beta but stayed on the fence about it until i watched Pro league and the 2016 French nationals at Paris games week. I was hooked immediately and i'm proud to call the players and casters from back then my friends and coworkers :)

&amp;#x200B;

Since season 4 finals (Y2S1) i've casted &amp; hosted every Proleague &amp; Major event, some minors and lots of online Challenger league in my early days. I also stream Rainbow 6 among other things on my twitch channel and focus a lot on Pro league analysis streams aka VOD reviews so i can learn from my casting mistakes, focus on team setups and learn from / teach viewers how to work better with your squad!

fpyaeh,FirebugRM,I've seen criticisms that the new operators aren't as grounded in reality as they used to be but i think Harry (Six) is a reason for this.,"Rainbow was meant to be the best of the best, a coalition of the finest counter terrorist fighters in the world. If you look at all the launch operators, and most of the operators up until last year, they were fairly realistic and grounded in their uniforms and talents and motivations. Most of them are just best of the best of their CTU.

So why does Rainbow hire a private military company? Why does Oryx, some dude who was missing for 15 years, get let in? Amaru is an archaeologist vigilante, she could be useful but not on the ""frontlines"" so to the speak. Its like the criteria for entering became more lax. Plus there's Harry opening up a massive stadium and letting the public watch matches between CT operators? Seems like a good way for enemies to know their tactics.

I don't think Harry can be trusted. Ash had reservations with Nighthaven, and that's when i first felt a bit weird about Harry's choices.",10,1585320939,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fpyaeh/ive_seen_criticisms_that_the_new_operators_arent/,Rainbow6,3

fpxeau,kainzy_,Amaru Rework Concept,"Amaru‘s grappling hook is now also new form of soft breach. You can shoot your grappling hook at a wall, (an outline of what will open is there like Hibana) or barricade. This will make a hole somewhat like Sledge’s hammer would. Her hook works on a recharge timer and can be used every 20 seconds. She can open walls from 20m or less. As stated earlier, it can be used on barricades also. Amaru can also open soft hatches from below (or above). 

I feel like this would add a cool new soft breach operator that combines aspects from Sledge/Buck and Ash/Zofia. There are many other rework ideas or things to can add to this concept. Maybe allowing Amaru to rappel up hatches with this rework? Maybe give her a passive ability where she has a quiet rappel and has the ability to do a 360 on rappel? There are a lot of ways to make Amaru useful, and I think this is one of the best ways.

Community is the main source for csgo awesome skins.

Maps/skins are introduced after being voted by the community before they are introduced in game , so they will mostly be popular when they are introduced.

All of the csgo's famous practise maps(aim lab,aimprac,spray control) are community made.

fptuca,jake-jdb,Clash nerf idea,"Clash nerf idea: have sledge (only his hammer, no melee) be able to do damage to the shield and eventually break it, or get it to the point where there’s holes that you or your teammates can shoot through. It will take a good amount of hits from the hammer (maybe 7-10 or so?) so you have to think about usage of your 25 total hits you get in a round. This will obviously also leave you vulnerable so you need to be smart about it. 

Maybe my idea sucks, but I do know that clash NEEDS a nerf, because right now, she doesn’t really have a direct counter (I could be wrong, I don’t do a lot of research regarding clash) what do you guys think?",7,1585300416,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fptuca/clash_nerf_idea/,Rainbow6,1

fpttxa,MrFreedomMcBaguette,Recruit is literally god.,"Recruit has a M249 Saw with a Reflex sight, Super shorty. 3 stun grenades, and 2 frags. 

You can make a crowch level hole in a soft wall with the super shorty. So there's breaching ability.

He also has the ability to spray n' pray, which is by far my favorite ability, I cannot aim for shit.

As for the grenades. The most effective tactic i've found with them, is yeeting them all at once into a room, and rushing, while spraying with your saw. Literally has never failed.

On top of all this, he has 2 armor. Which allows speed, but also doesen't make you 1 hit one kill like most 1 armor defenders/ attackers.

fpt4rw,Buck_Shot1,Future of Maps in Siege,"I was wondering what the general consensus is on the quality of maps. I will open this saying I am very against the most recent maps that have been added, and feel that they are beginning to blur into one another.

My friends and I play the game exclusively for fun, we have our moments where we try to clutch a round or secure a win here and there, but we never go a whole game trying as hard as we can. I believe this has a large part in our opinions of the maps. For bias sake, my favorite maps have always been house, plane, and original Hereford base.

It seems that the maps have been trying to become more and more competitive, but as they do so they seem to lose their charm. I personally love the flaws in maps, I believe it is what makes them enjoyable. All of the maps I named as my favorites, had obvious flaws, but that is what made them so enjoyable to play. A difficult to defend objective, or one that is next to impossible to attack, forced us to come up with new strategies and adapt our play style. 

My friends and I have determined what we consider the two factors that most of the new maps have in common: hallways/doorways and color scheme. 

Starting with hallways/doorways, you can see this on the new oregon rework very clearly. It almost feels like many of the new maps are mazes with how many doors there are now. It is not just the addition of new doorways, but the shrinking of existing ones. I noticed that some of the wide doors were shrunk down to single wide doors making the rooms feel less open. The thing that actually inspired me to post this, was when I saw the rework that house is getting. As house has always been my favorite map, some of the changes I saw were welcomed additions, but many seemed to make the map less unique and lose it's charm.

The next factor we considered was the changing of colors. It seems that a lot of maps are fitting to a more earthy color palette. I would say that over half of the maps currently in the game feature mostly browns as their main colors. Obviously no one wants a neon map that makes you vomit, but it seems that we haven't seen many different colors for awhile. 

I was just wondering what people's opinions are on the maps. Do you like the recent maps and reworks? Is it more important for a map to be fun and interesting than balanced and competitive?

Notes: 

Kanal is for sure an outlier in all of this, it is the one map I enjoyed more since it's rework and still find very fun to play. 

 I am not opposed to the addition of new things, for example I like the freezer on the Oregon map but I still think the map is far too connected. 

I do not play the game heavily, this may influence my opinion greatly, but I am unsure. I play at most maybe 4-6 games every 2 days, and go many days without playing at all. Because of this I may still find interest in a lot of the maps while more active players may be sick of them. (I am not a new player by any means, I have played since Black Ice, but was never interested in playing for long stretches of time)",5,1585296342,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fpt4rw/future_of_maps_in_siege/,Rainbow6,1

fpshbe,VigilThicc,Some operator reworks/tweaks,"Fuze: Shoots our 8 large impacts (in a ring rather than line pattern) that have a much large radius but do little damage, just enough to destroy gadgets

Glaz: No longer has to stand still, scope needs 3 seconds to charge to see thru smoke every time you aim. Still banana vision otherwise. 

Warden: No longer has to stand still. Enemies seen by warden for 2 seconds or longer with glasses up will be autopinged. 

Nokk: Gadget drains on movement. Don’t move, it will never drain. Sprinting/gu mines/etc. no longer have a blur effect but instead drain the battery heavily. Gadget can recharge even while active if she’s not moving. Fmg9 replaced with MP5SD. 

IQ: (QoL) Detected gadgets that have a direct line of sight to her (no “hard” walls/surfaces blocking her shot) will glow brighter.

Kali: Zoom —&gt;iron sights, 2.5x, 4x.

Iana: Hologram can fire dummy shots as a diversion. (Same sound, with a simulated muzzle flash)

Twitch: Zap has a small aoe so if you miss the target gadget by a little it will still damage it. Can pop goyo shields OR is quieter with LEDs turned down OR can jump every 10 seconds. 

BB: Can place bulletproof glass on windows or doors. Will cover half of it, cannot place on the other half. Can shoot out the supports on BB’s side. 

Frost: Mats replaced with thin wire snares (placed on doorways) that will immobilize attackers for 2 seconds. 

Dokkaebi: Defenders lose access to hacked cams (for less confusion) and mozzie drones will be fully controllable again. Calls are based on a 10m proximity, phones cannot be manually reset, must move out or get to a jammer. 

Vigil: White noise only appears on low battery. Same changes as nokk, except it will drain slowly even if standing still.",38,1585292661,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fpshbe/some_operator_reworkstweaks/,Rainbow6,1

fps97p,Corruption13,Warden Team Gadget Rework Suggestion," 

Warden is a terrible OP, and I feel a big reason for this is his selfish design with no benefits for his team like Jaegar or Wamai can achieve. I feel reworking the gadget while maintaining its functionality is the way to balance him. So here is a suggestion: 

Give him the ability to **drop a satchel of five of his Glance Smart Glasses** on the floor à la Rook's Armour plates that can be picked up by all operator.

The glasses passively give no buff to the user. However, Warden can ""activate"" it himself which will also activate all glasses on the map.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance Suggestions** 

&amp;#x200B;

* The ability should only have **three or fewer charges** for balance and **last less than two seconds**, three for Warden himself.
* (Optional) Attackers can **pickup non-headshot-killed glasses** dropped by defenders, like phones, for a double-edged sword.
* Activation triggers an **audible sound cue**, giving away roamer positions if used incorrectly. (*They can just not pick it up if its a random playing warden.*)
* **IQ** can see activated glasses, giving easy headshots.
* A **headshot from twitch's drone** will destroy the glasses.

And I got wondering if a Division agent got added into R6 as some new operator  what gadget do you think they would have ?

I thought maybe combat foam,  you'd shoot the foam on the ground and an operator running through the foam would cause the foam to congeal and greatly slow them. Crouching through the foam would cause loud sticky foot step sounds. 

Or maybe the gadget would be the agents watch,  specifically the AI ISAC. The player would get 3 activations. Activating ISAC would cause him to to give the player valuable intel.

fpq1dk,MrYacthyboat23,Possible idea- Operation Health 2.0,"Many people are always are agruing, especially on this subreddit on how much bugs this game has and glitches and how ubisoft apparently isn't fixing this game. Just like the Consulate bug going on now many people are upset.

Well i feel Ubisoft can switch everything up and spend an extra 3 months fixing their game. The skins out in the battlepass just show the effort Ubi is doing right now and the skins just aren't that good.

Possible ideas:

- Tachanka still gets his rework release 

-Instead of a mediocre new map or rework you can play House 24/7 

-As an interesting idea you can play Doc on attacking

If feel in this situation everyone wins, nobody loses. Theres alot of operators new players are trying to save up for and its crazy because if you add it up together it's like 300k renown for just a new player. New players can use this season to catch up with those operators they don't have. The reworks lately have been kind of iffy, old Oregon and Kanal were great maps most players enjoyed. The main problem with Oregon was spawn peeking and they mostly didnt even fix it! 

If there was a debate flair i would use it for this because i know I'm going to catch heat for this but if you disagree why?",4,1585280671,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fpq1dk/possible_idea_operation_health_20/,Rainbow6,1

fppbo0,da_dank_cookie,The Siege Battle Pass,"So ive seen alot of y’all complaining about the content in the battle pass, comparing it to games like Fortnite and Call of Duty but hear me out.

Aside from the invite bp (battle pass) this is ubi’s first shot at a actual seasonal bp. I think a bit of slack needs to be given, yea the skins are kinda shitty i get that but would you rather them put these skins into premium packs? I think ubi needs a bit of time, we know they can make some sick cosmetics and im positive theyll learn from this and next season make a bp that has detailed and out their skins. 

Also people are talking bout the value for money. So lets be realistic you get for 1200 r6 credits. 8 bundles each with a charm, skin, headgear and uniform which ubi usually sells at 1080 r6 creds, you get 7 free alpha packs ranging from rare to legendary in guaranteed rarity, 6 1 day renown boosters and 600 of the 1200 r6 credits you spent back. The question of is it worth it is down to the individual and if you want some a certain skin but i will take this system over gambling for the one thing i want in premium packs

I think we all just need to step back, and remember ubi most of the time learns from their mistakes and mishaps and next season we will get a good battle pass with sick cosmetics.",4,1585277594,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/fppbo0/the_siege_battle_pass/,Rainbow6,1
