fsoghw,Erasmo_Rotterdam,My finished gesture controlled Magic Mirror,"Hi r/DIY

I have finally finished my Magic Mirror. To control it I have incorporated a gesture sensor that allows me to interact with the mirror. I've put together [a two-part tutorial](https://okupatic.com/2020/03/29/magic-mirror/)  (with pictures and video) that I hope you find interesting and useful.

The tutorial is in Spanish but at the end of it you will find the option to translate it into your language.

I’d like to change the fabric for a blackout type however it’s quite expensive to do (in my country) 
I was wondering if anyone has used curtain black out fabric on roller blinds? It’s far cheaper but I’m guessing there are some cons to doing this? Eg May stretch or warp etc... 

Any info appreciated.

fskror,HurtsLiketheDickings,"Dry wall horror show, additional pointers needed.","Hi everyone,

So the towel bar installed into our house has fallen off multiple times every single time, the plastic anchor loosened and the screw would not stay in.

So at this point I've got 2-3 questions at this point.

1. Do I need to find a stud for a plastic anchor? If not, what do I do to secure the towel bar?
2. What do I do to cover and/or remove the old anchors? I see a lot of Home Depot videos showing me what to do in the best case scenario, but I'm also trying to keep things simple as I don't  have too many of the tools I may need for this (Willing to buy some, of course).

fsk5wr,jkchbe,Concrete foundation for storage shed question,"I'm wanting to build my own 10x16 storage shed in my backyard with a nice concrete foundation and epoxy coated concrete floor for the shed floor. I can do all the work myself but the thing I'm having a hard time with is figuring out how I need to make the pad.

My lot is relatively flat but it does have a slight slope where it's going to go and when it rains hard there can be about an inch of standing water where the front left edge of the shed will go. It doesn't last for more than a day after rain.

I can't find online a good way to approach putting the concrete sub base in. if I dig out to dry dirt and compact, put some course gravel down (a couple inches?), compact that, and put in 1 ft. deep and 1 ft. wide footer in the corners with the main slab being 4 inches should I be completely good? I'd do rebar in the footers and wire mesh for the bulk of the 4-inch think center area. Is this ""overdoing"" it? Underdoing it? I certainly don't want to have it crack or sink/settle out of level. I'm not so worried about cracking as I am the level and water errosion. Do I need some type of vapor barrier for a shed? Lots of details online about needing it for finished flooring in a conditioned home, not sure if a shed needs it?

The only thing on the slab will be the 10x16 wood framed shed, 8 ft. walls with siding, standard pitch roof. No loft or anything. Should be minimal weight. I might put in a riding mower in there - that would be the heaviest thing. It's going to have a work bench and some shelving for storage of light stuff. No heavy equipment.

Would love some help finding a corner of the internet where I can get these details. Or recommendations from the Reddit DIY community. Thank you.",17,1585685127,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsk5wr/concrete_foundation_for_storage_shed_question/,DIY,2

fsj7g0,noiziv,Need help getting a nice finish spraypaint on headphones,"Hi there!

Just today I spraypainted a few parts of my headphones in satin gray but there are some rough spots here and there. I prepared the parts by sanding them first with 150 grit followed by 240 grit. Afterwords I washed it in soapy water and let it dry before spraypainting.

Here are some pictures to help me explain my problem:
https://imgur.com/a/wbDuofS

The first picture shows the finish how I would like it to be, and most of the parts are finished like that. However, the other pictures in the album show some rougher spots. 

I'd like to fix those spots and make 'em look like the first picture but I wouldn't know why those spots came out differently because the preperation was exactly the same on all the parts. 

Could you guys help me figure out what my next steps should be in fixing this?",20,1585682096,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsj7g0/need_help_getting_a_nice_finish_spraypaint_on/,DIY,7

2. How many lag bolts should I use to attach the crossbar to the post?
3. Is this the right type of timber for the project?
4. How can I best prevent the timber rotting out?
5. My wife will want to stain the timbers, and I'm thinking they'll need a protective coating.  What should I use for that?
6. Will digging a hole and setting the timber be enough, or does this require cement?
7. How much cement would this project need?

My wife's biggest concern with putting this together is that it's going to take me 5 trips to the store (I have a bad track record with diy projects).

fsfqx1,fleafly,Looking to install engineered hardwood over an uneven concrete subfloor,"https://imgur.com/a/N8fBxwq

I'm in the process of of installing engineered hardwood flooring in my ""family room"" in the basement.  The subfloor of the basement is concrete with a decent crack down the center.  Like everything else in this house there is nothing square or level.  If you look at the pictures in the album you'll see that corner B is 2/8"" lower than corner A and corner C is 3/8"" of an inch lower than corner D.  In addition to that the C&amp;D wall is 2"" lower than the A&amp;B wall.  When I look at the instructions for installing the hardwood flooring it says that the subfloor should be level and you should not install it if there is a 3/16 difference over 10 feet.  Ideally I'd use self leveling concrete to level the floor but the C&amp;D wall is 2"" lower and that's too much for doing the self leveling compound.  Would I be able to put the self leveling compound down to even out the difference from A to B but still keep the 2"" slope?  Is the subfloor just too unlevel to lay down hardwood as is?  We plan on running the hardwood boards parallel to the A&amp;B wall so I was hoping the slope down to the C&amp;D wall would be unimportant.  The underlayment that Lowes told us to buy is a 3mm underlayment, is there thicker underlayment that would work better?  My internet searches say that cork or foam underlayment can get as thick as 6mm.  Would that compress enough in the high spots that would work to lay down and install the floor as is?

edit: also, the room is not that big, it's supposed to be 210 inches by 130 inches, not feet.  I'm just dumb and in a hurry sometimes.",15,1585671225,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fsfqx1/looking_to_install_engineered_hardwood_over_an/,DIY,2

fsbn2o,D0esANyoneREadTHese,How to keep heat from escaping while working in the attic?,"I have a rather large attic but because of the placement of our furnace and the structural design of the house, converting it into more living space is very impractical. However, because it's well-ventilated with good electrical access, doesn't let sound into the rest of the house, and has bare joists so I can easily build to suit my needs. I'm thinking of using it as a workshop since the garage is still full of other people's crap, we don't have a basement, and I'm finding the spare bedroom to be kinda limiting with its carpeted floor, terrible ventilation, and 15A power. 

Problem being, it's not insulated on the roof, it's insulated on the ceiling (the attic floor). The roof vents do their job well, and with the trapdoor open, it starts pulling a pretty big draft up through there and the furnace starts running within 5 minutes. I would close the trapdoor but the folding ladder can't easily fold from the top, not to mention the door doesn't have a latch accessible from the top.

I've been throwing a piece of plywood over the door and draping a tarp over, which seems to extend the time until the furnace kicks on by a decent margin, but I can still feel some draft coming through. I'd put a better-sized piece of plywood over so it completely seals but that doesn't work because of the ladder design, it's one of the telescoping Werner ones with top rungs that stick up above the floor.

I am not very knowledgeable on DIY and construction - I recently discovered axle stands, metal sawhorses and builders trestles when looking for other things that can be used as a squat rack (for gym). Axle stands (but taller) would be perfect, but the tall enough ones cost hundreds of pounds, tall enough saw horses tend to have bases slightly too wide such that i might trip on them re-racking the bar and builders trestles would probably work, but with no folding mechanism make storage a pain.

fs6yl8,SoThatHappenedpnw,Dryer Venting Conundrum,"I've recently remodeled my laundry room and even built a nice pedestal for the washer and dryer to sit on with room for baskets underneath. I'm very happy with most of it, but anything worth doing, is worth doing right.  The first picture in the album is my finished laundry room with the washer on the right and the dryer behind that. The path for the dryer vent takes it out the back wall (with the window) makes a sharp right turn, then runs about 14 feet to the exterior of the house. 

I don't like this at all because.

1. I cannot push the pedestal against the wall, as the dryer vent is in the way.
2. The path uses non smooth venting in an attic crawlspace\\storage area, and is prone to denting
3. There is a sharp 90 (that looks terrible) and then a long run to the outside

I see 4 possibilities for fixing this, as outlined in the picture of the front of the house 

1. I could vent it directly out to the exterior of the house, but it would be very high on the interior (50"" off the floor), which is only kind of hidden by the dryer. I could run some in the wall venting to accommodate for this a little, but then I'd have 2 90s. I think that wall is 2x6, so I'd have room, but insulation properties would suffer.
2. I could run it to the crawlspace and then vent it out the roof of the crawlspace. I'd lose a little bit of headroom, but not much. The disadvantage here is how it would look from the outside.
3. I could Run it straight across, or maybe cut a hole in the floorboards and vent it to the front of the house. 
4. I could move it entirely to be BEHIND instead of to the left of the dryer, and run it straight up, through the attic, and vent it on the roof. This is the most work, and the longest run (aside from #5 below), but would be the most aesthetically pleasing. 
5. I could just move the vent up 2 feet to give room for the pedestal, and let the rest of the run be essentially the same. 

I'd appreciate any help I can get on this. I'm wanting to make sure this vent is super smooth and not going to cause me any problems down the line!",7,1585631586,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fs6yl8/dryer_venting_conundrum/,DIY,1

I have a brass boiler, it has a screw on cap, the original cap is made of Delrin, the thread is M32/2, for aesthetic reasons I bought a stainless steel replacement ""base"" and had a wooden knob turned from some really nice hardwood, the base screws into the knob.

Boiler is part of a La Pavoni Europiccola

Boiler cap base in stainless steel without knob is from [http://www.wilycafe.com/page6/index.html](http://www.wilycafe.com/page6/index.html)

The problem is the steel base thread binds in the boiler, the seller that sold the base blamed the boiler manufacturer and so I purchased an M32/2 tap and ran it through the boiler which did nothing so the boiler thread is fine, it's the base's thread diameter (32.05mm) it's outside the spec for M32, how would you go about getting the base to screw into the boiler?

Thoughts, I want to make it fit because I had the knob handmade and it would be such a waste to trash it?

How would you do it, belt sander, dremel, die, find someone with a lathe and give them a case of beer?

I have been looking at insulating and framing my basement but not sure how to get around these. Thought of these options

-Frame around and put them inside the wall with insulation
-Have them moved forward so they would sit in the newly framed wall (was considering getting them changed for some with more outlets and individual valves so not the end of the world) 
-Build a box around them but this would cause a cold spot in the insulation",3,1585625374,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fs5jrp/framing_around_existing_water_manifolds/,DIY,1
fs5gs6,doppelganged,Beat way to remove paint from wood deck boards,"Would like to remove the paint from the deck boards on our covered porch and apply a stain. I tossed around the idea of just replacing the boards, but they are in good shape and no rot, so wondering if removing the paint is a better solution. 

Searching online shows recommendations from paint stripper + power wash to renting a floor sander, and everything in between. I am leaning toward the floor sander because intuitively it makes sense and also so I can use it on the floor of the screened porch out back that has the same paint while I have it.

What's the best method to get this off?

fs4w1y,jacle2210,Looking for help and advise on replacing my garage shop lights.,"These two bulbs went from 100% working to doing the flickering thing and eventually coming on, to flickering only, to not working or flickering at all (over the course of a few years).

So maybe if a fix won't cost too much, maybe our tax refund can finally get me some light in my garage.

I have been seeing the new LED bulbs and have been wondering if they would work? But I have no idea if I have to worry about 'Ballasts' needing to be replaced and not quite sure what they even do or if this light fixture even has ballasts.

I think this is an 8ft fixture and as you can see it's wired to a wall switch as opposed to being a pull-switch fixture.

Thanks.

frp9lu,sillyuniverse,"Repainting small old kitchen, tricky wall","Hey guys, I was hoping collective experience of all you crafty people can help me come up with something.

I was planning on redoing my kitchen walls but I ran into a few problems when I tried exposing the wall. 

I am aware there are tons of articles and diy discussions on the causes of the paint peeling, a few of which apply in my situation however I am not sure if anything different can be done in my case.

So I live in a flat in an old building (traditional British tenement built in the 1880s), ground floor flat so get all the cold and draft in the world.
When I moved in I immediately noticed kitchen paint start peeling. (it shares a wall with the outside close, is barely 1.5m in width x 4m length) I have three spots that keep getting worse: in front of the oven, washing machine and above the sink so obviously high heat and humidity areas (barely under a meter between the oven/washing machine and the wall which means steam hits the walls directly when you open the oven). the only window in the kitchen does not open however extractor hood is used and also another extractor leading directly outside is always on.The are some leftover paint emulsion in the utility cupboard that suggests it's supposed to be fit for high-humidity areas,also does not seem to be a problem in other high heat/humidity areas (such as bathroom where walls even get wet) with even less ventilation.

The peeled areas show another layer of paint so I am guessing right before I moved in it was just painted over. So due to all above I am just guessing it was not prepped well but it seems like it might not be the only issue, otherwise it'd be pretty straightforward.

Judging from the building it's brick wall though I'm genuinely not entirely sure after that. the whole kitchen wall has greatly varying thickness  and a knife or a nail goes in for at least 4cm (which is def more than a layer of paint and some plasterboard would be) in the thickest area to then only a few mm in others (the peeled off area has also exposed multiple holes which I assume someone previously didn't try filling in as you could just blow the dust out) The utility cupboard on the same side of the building has part of a wall exposed which kinda shows the cross section ,covered brick then what I assume looks like drywall (added a picture of a broken-off piece I found) it's pretty soft and breaks off sort of like wet tree bark. I'm just guessing that pretty lame job was done covering up the wall. 
Honestly I've repainted walls before but it was usually more straightforward than this... Currently not entirely sure where to start. 

Sooo in conclusion I am stuck and looking for any ideas... As I mentioned above, initially I was going to follow the standard process for repainting but I do not want to paint over this tragically uneven wall and then have the paint go in a month again.  if I were to do something with this..removing paint and sanding down to same thickness, prepping it properly should do it or should I resort to some other solution (honestly wouldn't mind a bare wall at all but judging from brick condition that's not a great idea). Does anyone have any different ideas  for  any other solutions for a kitchen like that, I really don't want to abandon the kitchen remake as I've moved forward with other parts of the flat..

frn5it,alketrax,Bicycle Repaint Project,"I recently purchased [this](https://imgur.com/3xpzjlq) bicycle used from another guy that has had it for almost a decade. I think the current look is not bad but I want to add my personal touch to it and am thinking of doing a custom paint job for it. I have a mechanic that I can get to strip down the bike down to frame but I want to do the painting myself, so the reason for this post being that I have little to no experience like this and would like some advice. I have done some research on the process and I have found some conflicting information pertaining to painting bicycle frames, especially aluminium ones that I got confused and worried about whether I should be DIY-ing this at all.

First of all there's the question of using a paint stripper vs just sanding. Do I use a paint stripper and then sand it using different grits? Or do i just started sanding it using rougher to finer grits? Do I wet sand/dry sand? I've read so many different ways of doing it that I'm not really sure which one I should be going for. 

After sanding comes painting. I will be using cans of spray paint since they are the most accessible to me. One thing that is consistent is that I should use a primer on the bare metal before applying any coats of paint to prevent the paint from chipping and peeling so that's one thing out of the way. 

Next would be the type of paint. Is there a difference in suitability in using matte/glossy finish paints? Or does it not matter since that only boils down to the clear final coat that I will have to use. One of the things that I want to achieve with a DIY paintjob is to also paint in the designs using stencils instead of pasting decals so that I have a smooth and even finish. Others have also suggested to me to just hand the frame to a shop and have them do a powder coat and then paste on decals anyway.

I recently bought a house and have been learning the ins and outs of doing simple plumbing, electrical, demolition, and landscaping.

Now looking into woodworking projects. I'm not big on getting into woodworking as a hobby or skill. I simply want the custom end products I can build. There are some incredible woodworking shops in the area that can do truly beautiful works of art for competitive prices. So I would be going to them for anything above the projects listed below:

[https://ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/classic-storage-bed-king](https://ana-white.com/woodworking-projects/classic-storage-bed-king)

[https://ana-white.com/community-projects/washer-dryer-pedestal-platform-drawers](https://ana-white.com/community-projects/washer-dryer-pedestal-platform-drawers)

\^ Here are examples of the projects I'd like to do along with building a deck, building gardenbeds, installing a new fence, shelves and other fixes around the house. Very simple projects, very simple looking, no crazy inlays.

I'm completely not against getting lumber pre-milled, as I still come out ahead economically on many of these projects when doing the labor myself.

What tools do I need? I was thinking...

Circular saw with kreg jig

Miter Saw (maybe a compound sliding)

Sander

Brad Nailer

Is there anything I'm missing? Literally just learned a little bit about milling wood this morning and still don't know what things like a router do. Trying to stay away from having to buy a table saw or too many tools.

I've mounted a couple tv mounts before but I want to be extra careful since this is my buddy's new house. I want to be sure that the studs are safe to use.

Pics of the area / tv / tv mount above. I've taped the bottom/top edges of the horizontal stud that runs above the closet, and the vertical stud that's on the adjacent wall to the right (which is as wide as the tape). The tv is less than 30 lbs and the mount is rated for 60-65 lbs. 

The tv mount has 3 screws that will go into the wall. 
My questions to get started: 
1. Would it be safe to mount the tv on either of these studs?
2. Is it safe to have either the bottom or middle screw go into the horizontal stud above the closet and the others go into the drywall?",17,1585532362,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/frhtg5/mounting_tv_above_a_closet_which_studs_are/,DIY,1

My dad owns a property that has no building where we are just getting some electricity and don't even have water! I figured for the last two years that I would build something like a shed or a camper or simply a place I can call my own.  P.S Iv always also wanted to build a big simple dog house for my German Shepherd.

The only support I have is myself the internet... iv watched many YouTube videos and my tools! ( I actually bought a drill / impact driver and circular saw just for this ""project.""

My biggest problem is low confidence in doing things myself i.e not trusting etc. This usually leads to me starting something getting frustrated trying and giving up or stopping before I screw up or immediately when I do mess up.

Not trying to make excuses but ADHD really doesn't help.

Common problems I run into that I just cant seem to figure out and seem so simple are:

\- After framing walls on a super simple square structure how do they connect at the corners? 

\- When framing or putting together the floor I realized that to make a 4x4 structure you have to account for the 2 inches on the 2 x 4 at the corners?

\- How do you secure the wall frames to the floor frame and plywood?

\-When framing assuming im using a grill or impact driver and screws do I need to drill smaller pilot holes to actually be able to drive the screws in?

\- I got to a point where I wasnt sure if I know how to drive screws into wood or even question my ability to perform simple tasks like hammering a nail into wood. I even watched videos on using a drill to make sure I wasn't doing something silly.

I have found may inscrutables that assume people have the knowledge on minor things. If anyone can help me answer some questions offer suggestions on what I can do to get better or be more confident that would be amazing. Attached is a picture of my dog house build that wouldve been a build I did before my guardshack build that I thought id be able to do.

I live in a pretty new home, built in 2016 and has a Rinnai tankless hot water heater (RL75i to be exact). It runs on natural gas. Just yesterday I noticed Ice cold water when the hot tap was open on a sink and then today the same issue happened and also was cold in the shower.

We tried turning the unit on/off, unplugging, even reset the breaker on the power outlet the unit is on and tried changing it to a totally separate outlet. I also tried turning the hot and cold water valves off/on again thinking all of this would maybe reset and “wake it up”. After doing this, we turned on the hot water and it came out hot for just a few seconds and the unit started beeping with code #11. 

A quick google search says that Rinnai error code 11 is an indication that there is no ignition in, or no gas supply to your hot water system. It suggests checking to see if your hot water system has any visible damage or loose parts and to locate your gas supply and ensure it is turned on. I can’t imagine either of these are the case.

After doing some research, we decided to try our hand at adjusting one but didn't have any luck.  We found that the sash itself is still square, but the frame is way out of whack.  The gallery link has various pictures of the window, the operator, the frame, etc.

We removed the top and bottom arms, and made sure they were straight.  The top one had bent a bit, but even after getting it back into shape it didn't make any difference.  We pulled the trim off the window inside to see if we could possibly shim the frame, but the drywall goes flush up against the frame, and the inside frame seems to be a bit higher than the outside sill.  Short of cutting away drywall on the inside or removing the cedar trim around the window on the outside, I'm not sure we can get to the frame itself.

Just to be sure it wasn't the sash, we swapped from the window on the floor directly below this one which opens/closes OK, and it wouldn't close at all in this frame, likely because the sash in this frame has worn a bit of a divot/groove into it to close over the screw that holds the metal arm on the frame.

Wondering if anyone has any ideas on ways to attach the sash so it won't drag, or if we need to figure out a way to reset the frame so that it is square again.  Any ideas greatly appreciated.

I'm in the process of putting up a stone veneer over a brick fireplace and the surrounding wall. Previously the brick was covered with mortar, cement board, and marble, which was then surrounded by wood. 

I didn't pay a lot of attention to the cement board and tile during removal, but after ripping off the top pieces I found this hole that goes through the bricks and to a hole in the top of the fireplace interior. It doesn't look like an accident. I'd like to know what it's for and if I need to do anything special for it, like keep the top or bottom of it open beneath the cement board for venting or something. I've done some Googling but haven't seen anything like this yet.

I rent and our company takes forever to fix anything so kinda on my own. Here’s what happened. Dryer was working fine. Then go to start it won’t start. Things I’ve noticed that may be important ? The lint trap was extremely full like more full then usual. I dont let it build up it must’ve just been the load (have a dog sheds constantly) The dryer is on a breaker by itself. The day before I was checking something and was turning breakers on and off a lot and I’m wondering now could I have done something that blew the dryer? Everything else in house works. The door switch does click when I press it in. I guess my question is could I have blown a breaker by turning on/off too much or blown the dryer ? Anyway any help would be awesome.

frblem,JTGrey,A little design help for a backyard gable shed.,"I'm planning on having a shed put in my back yard. I've got a nice size-able back yard but only a double garage to put toys, tools, and cars. I want to build a 12x16 shed [like this](https://www.construct101.com/12x16-shed-plans-gable-design/) but what i also want to do is put it on a cement pad that i'll pour as a 16x16 and have a 4' over hang on one of the sides to be over the door/window side, throw 3-4 4x4's as support pillars to connect to the truss'. 

My question is if i attempt to do that do i make the roof as a 16' wide sat on top of a 12' wide shed with overhang to 4""x4"" pillars at the 16' mark? would that look awkward? or do i make a 12' wide roof for the shed and somehow do a flat overhang over the 4'x16' slab left? 

Also looking for an instruction sheet for doing a 16' truss if that's what's recommended for the roof, measurements and cut angles. i've been searching for truss plans but none seem to be 16' or if they are they don't have the cut angles and measurements...

So I am in the SF Bay area and like the rest of the country, we are under a shelter in place order.  Making things more stressful in my case I got a 2-year-old at home and now a 2 week old. 

I am lucky that I have a backyard in my house, but, the previous owner had it concreted over.  What are my options to make the flooring more kid-friendly?  Is it really just rubber mats? It seems the cost is going around $7-8 an sqft so I am looking at $700 just for a 10sqft area which seems like a lot, on top of the cost for equipment.

I have a few visible seams and some bubbling on my walls from wallpaper that the previous owner painted over.

I started removing the painted over wallpaper but ran into several problems. I used a scoring tool, applied wallpaper remover then used a scraper to remove. It seems that the wallpaper was applied directly to the sheet rock. While removing it I am also peeling away the outer white layer of sheet rock exposing the brown paper underneath. I have researched and found that the brown paper areas can be repaired but they are becoming numerous and some are quite large being over a foot long. All the videos I have found  no one  is running into this problem.

I got a little thing I was planning to hang on the inside of my closet door. It's just a row of hooks to hang ties and belts on and a little basket you could maybe use to hold your wallet and keys. It came with two 1¼"" screws and ancors for hanging it.

But the door I want to hang it on is the style with a frame around the outside and a thin panel of wood in the middle. It's probably a half inch thick, max.

Can I safely swap in a much shorter screw since it's not going to be holding a whole lot of weight? It seems like only two or three threads are going into this door before it starts coming ou the other side.  Should i try gluing a 1"" thick strip of wood on to the door and screwing it to that? Is there an adhesive based fastener that might world?

The list of medications that interact with St. John's wort in this way includes oral contraceptives, warfarin, cyclosporine, amitriptyline, various anticonvulsant medications, simvastatin, alprazolam, various anti-HIV treatments, digoxin, and theopilines.

I am installing a new kitchen sink and it came with the clips shown above. (I hope they're called clips, sorry English isn't my first language). Now in all the videos I've watched clips like these are nowhere to be seen. 

Are they just part of what I need to fix the sink to the counter or am I missing something else? 

This is also the only image on Google I could find of these specific ones, so maybe they're to be used for something completely else?

It was soft at the front but then very hard and then finally hollow. I then installed the anchors that came with the shelf.  I then used.the screws that came with the shelf and start screwing the shelf into the wall.  I noticed that one screw was turning but not going into the anchor anymore.   Turns out it was just spinning the anchor in the wall grinding the plaster/drywall around it  As a result, the hole got too big and the whole thing was loose.  I took it out and found that the other anchor snapped in half in the wall.  

I now have two anchor sized holes.  One has a bit of anchor stuck in it.  

The shelf is thin and has a geometric design below it.  It won't hide the old holes. Also, based on room design, the holes are exactly where they need to be for the shelf to be hung.  Even if it went slightly up or down, the shelf wouldn't cover the old holes and they'd be very visible.

fqtjpw,justwanttofilter,Can I pour grout into a mold to make a hearth pad?,"
I am making a hearth pad for a small wood stove. I have the mold but I accidentally bought grout instead of a bag of quickcrete. We are under stay home orders in my state so I’m wondering if I can use the grout for the same purpose? I have looked online and all I can find is descriptions of the difference between grout and cement but nothing about this type of application.

fqqsq8,agsf,Help with choosing plywood for a home climbing wall,"My climbing gym is closed indefinitely and I won't be climbing outside for a while (for obvious reasons), so I decided it's time to build a home climbing wall for training indoors through the brutal Houston summer. I'm not very experienced with construction, but after reading a number of articles and watching a few videos, plus a healthy dose of consultation with my engineer brother in law, I'm all set on the planning front. I've also ordered all my hardware and an initial set of climbing holds, all of which should be arriving this week. 

The Metolius PDF linked below says that one should use 3/4"" ACX plywood. However, as plywood is the second most expensive item after holds, I'm wondering if I can get away with something less pricey and easier to find. In my limited reading about plywood, I've gathered that different grades have different face veneers, glues, and core material. A lumber yard near me that fits my needs (reasonable delivery fees, ability to do a few cuts on the bigger pieces) has BC plywood but nothing of higher quality, which I understand has a less aesthetically pleasing veneer and doesn't have the outdoor/water resistant-ish X. I'm not all that concerned about these two issues. 

My main concerns about using a lower quality plywood are: 

* **Interior voids causing weakness, potentially leading to T nuts pulling through**.

* Less of a concern: Loss of stiffness (I'll be using 2x6 studs with 16"" centers, so I don't think this will actually be much of an issue).

* Least of a concern: potential for moisture damage if I need to move it to my uninsulated, un-air conditioned garage in gross humid Houston. 

**My question:**
**Will BC grade plywood have a weaker core &amp; more potential for interior voids that may cause issues than ACX plywood? [A photo of the plywood in question.](https://imgur.com/a/Tn8vrRR)**

Follow ups:

* Are there any specific things I should be looking for in a plywood for this application? I don't care all that much about the surface veneer appearance, just the structural integrity. 

* Is it a mistake to get lumber delivered without going to the store to personally pick it out? I'm trying to do this all without going to the store for social distancing/flattening the curve reasons. 

* Any other advice for me in my plywood adventures going forward? I shouldn't need to do any plywood cutting, but advice on other fronts is gladly accepted!





**Extras for anyone interested in specifics**

Details:

* Size: 8ft x 8ft, with a 12-24"" ""kicker"" (vertical board at the bottom for feet).

* Angle: Not totally sure yet, somewhere between 30-45 degrees overhanging. The plan allows for it to be adjusted with some effort if I decide it's too steep or low angle.

* T nut spacing: 4 inch grid using [these T nuts](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FJGT7QI).

* Starter holds: [Escape Climbing starter pack](https://escapeclimbing.com/collections/holds/products/ec39901).

Plans: 

* [The bible of home wall construction (pdf)](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/How-to-Build-a-Home-Climbing-Wall.pdf)

fqlevq,JimmysRevenge,How can I run additional wire through some existing underground conduit which already has wire running through it?,"My house has a detached garage. The garage has it's own 60AM panel that is fed from the main panel in the house.  That line as well as some romex for some lights on the garage which can be controlled from inside the house are run through some plastic conduit under ground.  

Unfortunately there is no string run through the conduit for me to pull more through.  I want to run some ethernet out there for the studio built above the garage as well as for a new security camera because the wifi out there isn't the best.  

I tried using a shop vac duct taped to the end of the conduit to as best a seal as I could and feeding through string with some plastic tied to the end of it (like a conduit mouse/cylinder), but the suction just wasn't working.  I don't know if it's because I couldn't get a good enough seal from the vac or if it just cannot pull the line/plastic through with other wires in there.  

Does anyone have any ideas?  Or am I gonna have to run more conduit if I want to accomplish this.",2,1585406530,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fqlevq/how_can_i_run_additional_wire_through_some/,DIY,1

fqkjt5,babbagack,Fire alarm unit itself need to be replaced?,"https://imgur.com/a/hg6rii4

So, this fire alarm is over 10 years old so may have reached end of life, perhaps all our fire alarms have, but this is the only one that has beeped even after giving it what I believe is a new battery.

It beeped like every 30 secs or min, early in the AM, I went to get the stool when I got back it stopped.  2 hours later it started beeping again as described.  Then I replaced the battery, and it still continued to beep.  

As shown in the picture, I took it out of the connection in the ceiling(broke a bit of the plastic but it should fit back on).  And then I noticed for a little longer it beeped a bit from the top unit inside the ceiling! I wasn't expecting that.  

As I had the new batter in the now detached unit, it was making a very quiet buzz noise too.  I took out the batter and it stopped.

In any case, does it appear I need a new fire alarm unit?  How to know which new one to get, maybe I can try Amazon too?  I think last I tested others in our place the other worked, so doesn't appear I need to replace all of them but correct me if so.

Lastly, I was checking another different easier to reach unit in another part of our place to compare, and I noticed that the green light was on, but inside it wasn't actually connected to the plug coming from the wiring in the ceiling. Should I plug that in?

Appreciate any help.  A good learning experience for me.",9,1585403524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fqkjt5/fire_alarm_unit_itself_need_to_be_replaced/,DIY,1

I was just  curious whats the safest way to mount it? Without it ruining the house and what not. Ive been reading a lot about it and peoples stories got me worried thats all. I was planning on maybe putting a block between the joists then mount the bag on the block or screwing a 2x4 on about 4 joists and putting the bag in the middle?

fqde7r,HowManyBotsToWasteO2,How do I pull up these layers of flooring without compromising subfloor?,"Hi everyone,

I've come across an interesting dilemma when redoing the floor in my house.

The previous (original) owners glued down a layer of linoleum (vinyl?) flooring on top the subfloor. On top of that layer, without pulling it up, they both stapled/nailed 1/8"" plywood (maybe very cheap hardwood, it's difficult to tell) on top of it, then glued another layer of linoleum onto the 1/8"" plywood.

I'm trying to rip up all the layers to lay down some quality hardwood flooring, but I'm afraid with how many, (of which they used A LOT of staples/nails as you can see in the pictures) and how deep of staples they used that it would potentially compromise the structural integrity of the subfloor.

I've attached some pictures and did my best to show and describe what's happening. Any advice on how to remove all of this without the threat of structural integrity issues with the subfloor would be greatly appreciated; the easier/cheaper the better! But if necessary, I''ll do what I have to obviously as this is my home.

Thanks again.

fq9qsb,Another4654556,HELP - Washing Machine is buckled at the bottom and makes horrible scraping sound. How to fix (cheaply)? Bang bottom with hammer? Replace suspension rods? Other?,"FYI - I picked this GE WCSE3100A1WW washing machine up off the road.  So far, it's cost me only the price of some hoses.  

As the machine fills with water, the bottom comes down and closes the gap until that nut scrapes against the bottom.  https://i.imgur.com/x0sGa1I.jpg

I don't know why the bottom is buckled like that.  Is that normal?    Is it something I can just bang out with a hammer?  Or is it by design to increase structural strength?

Alternatively, I noticed that if I gently push on the drum, perhaps and inch or two, it no longer scrapes the bottom. I could glue some foam to the front panel, and that would push the drum permanently off center by just a little bit. I held it there through spin as well, and didn't seem to cause any issue.  Now I know that off-alignment isn't generally a good idea, but just a little bit, is that going to cause serious problems very quickly?

fq3ido,ATOMutt,Outdoor AC unit not coming on,"Hey wonderful DIYers. I'm hoping to avoid the large expense of having a technician come out if possible. We have a newborn at home and I am worried about her overheating, but resources are tight these days.

Air is flowing through the house but it is not being cooled. The unit outside is not coming on. 

Under the advice of what I could find from Google, I have checked the following:

-The thermostat is set to *cool* and set at least 5 degrees below the indoor temperature

-Neither the breaker or the emergency shut off switch near the unit were popped

-The unit is clean

-The drain line is clear

-The air filters are almost new

Some sources said to look for a reset button on the unit. I found a button and pressed it. When the button is pressed, the unit comes on. It turns back off immediately when I release the button.

The model number for the unit is 13acd-024-230-14

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this? I can happily provide any additional information.

Our laundry room light fixture (a basic 48 inch flush mount shop light) uses F28 25 watt fluorescent tubes, both of which died last night.  We're renters and I know they're at least four years old.  The tubes don't appear to be available at the usual places, and as we're on lockdown, many of the smaller hardware/DIY businesses are closed.   I've also found that a lot of our basement level fixtures use bulbs that are hard to find, and as a result, super expensive, so I'm wondering if I can somehow safely swap out the F28 tubes for something cheaper and more readily available.

This actually seems like a really good idea. Only one thing bothers me, and that is that the plates are made of concrete. I'm afraid either the plates will be damaged after some use, or even worse, I damage my indoor floor/walls if I drop one.

fpqgds,LearnedLearner84,Concrete porch/deck underside is spalling - need advice for DIY repair.,"Hi all,

I need some advice on how to approach this DIY. I have a concrete porch where the underside is spalling. I have already sealed the top and their is no water intrusion and plan to use an epoxy or rubber sealant on the top to finish it (when it rains there is no more dripping into the underside).

&amp;#x200B;

How to I go about patching the spalled concrete on the underside? From the posts and videos I have seen, the steps I should take are:

1) Clean the underside of loose debris.

2) Treat the rebar to prevent further rusting.

3) Apply a concrete specifically for overhead application with a quicker drying time  [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Quikrete-20-lb-Polymer-Modified-Structural-Concrete-Repair-124125/207102852](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Quikrete-20-lb-Polymer-Modified-Structural-Concrete-Repair-124125/207102852) 

I also plan to sand and then use rustoleum paint on the iron beams.

&amp;#x200B;

Any other advice and guidance anyone out there can give me?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance,

fpp9x2,peaceonn,Strange cracking and water noise coming from a wall,"Hello, especially during the night and in the morning a cracking and water noise coming from a wall. Other walls do not have this noise at all. The wall is a middle wall which has no side to neighbours. I took a video of the sound. 

I don’t have an idea about what it is and to whom to call. 

Beside, it is not a continues sound. It lasts like 5 minutes and then goes away. After some time starts again...

See the record here. What can it be?

fpn11n,ghc86,A frame swing set,"Hey guys, just starting to look into this a bit, but so far all I am seeing are 3 person swing sets. I am guessing this is most likely the biggest safe distance for the top 4x6 to span? I was wondering if maybe it would be possible to do a 3 person swing and then maybe a tire swing off to the side? Anyone do this? I have 3 kids and planning on a 4th if possible so I would love for all of them to be able to swing at the same time. Hoping to make something big enough for all of them to use for as long as they are interested.

The tire swing would be great if I could just get a longer 4x6, otherwise I am guessing I might need another set of 4x4 supports in the middle to make it work safely for 4 people? I want to make sure it is really safe and overly engineered as opposed to taking any sort of risk if 4 is more of the 'might work, but not suggested' thing.

I have this idea to mount a pull bar for my kids in our basement.  I made a virtual version of my idea in Paint (the blue stuff between  pols in photo [https://imgur.com/a/Wu8AxEc](https://imgur.com/a/Wu8AxEc)).  The thing is I have no idea what parts I would need. I think I would  need some sort of a big clamp which I could screw together around posts  with a bracket which would allow me mount a bar itself. Generally I  would want to be able fairly easy unscrew these clams slightly and slide  the whole thing up, out of the way, if it is not being used. I searched  for clamps online but I don't even know what is out there and what are  the names of these parts. Perhaps big band clamps? (Pole has 3.11 inch diameter)  Could you guys help and give me examples of  parts I could use in this project? thanks! Or perhaps this whole idea is  STUPID because I shouldn't be using  these poles for anything! (my kids  are 4-7 years old so they are pretty light and these poles are mounted into concrete floor so I don't think they are going to move whatever we  do). Is it more dangerous than mounting stuff to joists?

ANYWAY, I just want to know the strongest adhesive to hold something up on a wall. I googled this and it just told me about command strips and how they can hold three pounds, my dad told me that the more you use the stronger the hold, is there like a chart for this, or can someone explain.  Like if you use one it can hold 3 pounds, if you use two can it now hold 6??  My dad told me a lot actually, but he's not the best when it comes to memory.  He told me that there's a caulk like substance that also works well, and like peels off by the edge or something?  I know when you go to the dentist and they have an adhesive, that's like really really strong, and you heat it and it comes off, my Dad told me that there's a commercial use for that as well, for like piping, I'm not sure it would work here but I'm just curious.

My mom has taken to making masks for my wife and her coworkers, but without a good way to sterilize them, it is a small solution.  I decided to build a box that could be used to sterilize them after being washed, and this is what I came up with.

It is far from perfect, and there are so many things I would change if I did it again, but I needed a solution, and I needed it with what I had lying around (sans the UV-C light).

We all need to do what we can to help prevent the spread of the virus, and this was my way of helping.  I am more than happy to answer questions if anyone has them.

fpen1z,Bisforbobby,Renting: Sloping yard fix?,"Renting a single family home. We're wanting to mulch the horrible area in the back of the house and yes, the management company has agreed for us to do this (cost being on us). Parts of the back yard pools water and I want to solve this issue before we put the mulch down. I believe the issue stems from a giant area of clay underneath this patch of dirt. I have checked, and clay is not under the actual grass seen in the yard. We would only be mulching the area just above that kid water table, nothing to the right of the flower bed.

I believe that if we put mulch over the existing spots then we'll have the same issue, is this true? I was thinking about getting some top soil or fill dirt and trying to grade the area myself and then continue with laying the weed barrier and mulch. I am not sure if there are any better viable and cheap fixes to this issue.

Quite a few issues here. I can DIY quite a bit but this is over my pay grade

* Gutter separated from roof leading to water pooling on deck.
* Deck is sloped towards home leading to water flowing towards house.
* Poorly flashed french doors and deck ledger led to subfloor, joists, sill plate etc. rotting out.
* Water continuing through drywall and pooling in basement.

The process as I understand it:

* exterior: jack the floor joists/temp wall &gt; replace sill plate &gt; replace rim joist
* interior: sister floor joists and replace subfloor
* doors: reinstall with proper flashing
* deck -???

**My question** before I start talking to contractors - is this deck salvageable or should I just demo it?

I'm comfortable demoing the deck, and would rather do that ahead of bringing in a contractor. If it's salvageable (maybe jack up the deck, flash, attach with new ledger) then I'd leave that to the contractor. Essentially I just want to be more knowledgable ahead of the conversation.",6,1585238079,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fpdw7k/rotting_2nd_floor_deck_joists_sill_plates/,DIY,2

Best I can tell, the smell is coming from the shelves themselves. They were custom built to fit in the closet and I’m guessing it’s either the type of paint they used or the caulk/sealant used on all the corners that’s causing the odor (maybe a combo of the two?).

fpbc4w,jeffnielson,Turning garbage bags into a disposable hospital gown for Covid19?,"I could use some help.  I work in an ED and we are re-using the disposable plastic gowns by wiping them down with cleaning solution.  This is not ideal, IMO.  I would like to be able to make more out of large garbage bags.  I did some searching and I should be able to seam the plastic with my temperature-controlled soldering iron.  I need to figure out how to pattern these things so they fit people and can be pulled off when we are done.

1. Has anyone seen a pattern for something like this?
2. My thought was to
   1. get large bags and seam the inner arms and sides of the torso first.
   2. Then cut head whole and trim sleeves and sides of gown
   3. then cut through just the back side for back ventilation and to tie oneself in
3.  There will be tons of details to work out, but a couple preliminary questions come to mind:
   1. Is there a rolling/cutting device that makes dotted cuts so we can tear them off? (there must be in the art community)
   2. Do you think the seems will be strong and reliable enough? (I think so)
   3. My seams will probably be weaker and less reliable with thinner plastic right?  I don't need a super thick plastic.
   4. I imagine bags are cheaper than buying sheets of plastic, but I will look at that.

fp53po,TimmehTim48,Air conditioner stopped working at apartment. Is this something shady?,"Howdy Howdy Howdy.

So the air conditioner in my apartment stopped working for the second time in a month. We set it well below the current temp, but it won't kick on. I did some research and although most of it was for home units, I found some tips. One suggestion was for clogged filters, but I don't think it is the filter because the land lord replaced it recently. I went outside and found these wires hanging out of the top. The green wire is screwed into the top of the unit (I'm assuming some kind of ground for something). I googled extensively on why you would want wires to come out of the top of the unit like this, but I can't find anything. Is this some shady shit the maintenance guys are doing for a cheap fix, or is this a legitimate practice? I am wondering if I should be mad or not. Any help is appreciated smile

fp1th9,jojo6292,Vertically-moving shoe shelf,"Hi guys - I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to post for advice, but I've been trial-and-erroring this vertically-moving shoe shelf for my mom's place for a while and I think it'd be helpful to get some advice from someone who may have built or done something similar.

Basically, my mom has a stair landing/corner area leading up to her place, and she wanted to make use of the wasted space up near the ceiling and put some shelving there for shoes. Rather than a static shelf (hard to reach!), we thought a shelf that could move up (storage!) and down (accessible!) would be a great use of that space.

I tried to find something off-the-shelf, but couldn't find anything besides big motorized shelves for garage storage, or swing-down type shelving for cabinets. So I tried to build something custom, using a counterweight system with pulleys and heavy-duty drawer slides.

It's definitely been a learning experience. 

Here's a video of it currently working:  
[https://imgur.com/a/o6oXsOb](https://imgur.com/a/o6oXsOb)

The link also shows a photo of it during an earlier iteration, before all the shelves and shoes were put in, so you can see the basic mechanics. (You can see that I made a mistake in where I mounted some of the pulleys.)

The counterweight that I have in the video is 25lbs -- that makes it easy enough to pull down, but still ""hard-ish"" to push up. I tried adding another 5lbs and 10lbs and it makes it harder to pull down and easier to push up. It's a tradeoff of course, so somewhere in there is a good counterweight balance and I could certainly add that. BUT taking a step back, the whole thing loaded up has become such a behemoth and harder to push/pull than I originally imagined/wanted. 

So that brings me to now -- I'm considering putting in some kind of remote-controlled motor that can wind/unwind cable to lift/lower the shelves instead. I haven't done a lot of searching yet, but thought I'd see if anyone could chime in while I plan my next step.

fp1a3x,Anna__V,Using laptop PSU to power SBC (eg. Raspberry Pi),"Hello.

I happen to have a \*bunch\* of old laptop PSU, ranging from 16V to 24V and 2A to 6A. I'd like to power Single Board Computers (SBCs) with a couple of these. Universally these SBCs take in 5V either via USB or a barrel jack, and they need approx. 2-5A @ 5V, depending on connected hardware. 

What is the easiest/most efficient/most reasonable way to use these old PSUs to power the little computers?

Reasons why I want to use these:

a) I happen to have them == no need to buy anything.

b) 5V/5A powerbricks are surprisingly expensive, if you're not buying them from China, and

c) Chinese 5V/5A powerbricks tends NOT to actually be rated for 5V/5A, surprisingly.

These old laptop PSU are good brands, do actually output rated power and thus would probably have no problems supplying 3\~5A @ 5V.

Just that... what is the most reasonable way to approach trying to drop down 16-24V to 5V?",3,1585180971,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fp1a3x/using_laptop_psu_to_power_sbc_eg_raspberry_pi/,DIY,1

foywtg,SteveTheBluesman,Old Maytag washing machine with broken agitator post - no parts available!,"Hi \~  
So a hoodie got stuck around the agitator and pulling it out broke off one of the fins on the post assembly so the auger is loose and no longer turns.  In fact, it is so loose is just comes right off with a light pull.

The model is PAV2300AWW, and the assembly is nowhere that I can find.

My question is, can a Maytag replacement agitator be screwed onto the spindle and work?  Would be a shame to dump the washing machine for this.  (Alternative Mickey Mouse question, could I drill a few screws through the auger to the post assembly to allow it to stay down and turn as needed?)

fowwh8,cknight18,2 backsplash tiling questions!,"First time tiling and I'm doing backsplash. I've got some nice big, 4x12"" subway tiles to do the trick. I've run into an issue of unevenness and I've got a couple of questions.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/tp4puOT) is what I'm working with. In case it's a little hard to see what's going on:

The *red* lines are the self leveling laser I put on the wall to see how level things are.

The *blue* indicate how high above the counter the laser is sitting.

The *green* indicate how high above the counter the cabinets are sitting on the *left* side.

The *orange* indicate how high above the counter the cabinets are sitting on the *right* side. 

Which brings me to my questions. 

(1) I was intending to start from the right side and work my way to the left. When I saw how much lower the left side of the counters were than the right (*blue* on the left vs right, about ¹/4""), I thought I should probably scribe the first row of tiles. I'd set up the laser level to 4+¹/8"" (height of the tile + an ¹/8"" spacer) and match the laser, going from right to left. Does this make sense to do? My feeling is that ¹/4"" is a pretty big difference and I feel like it'd be quite noticable.

(1a) if I do scribe the tiles on the first row, what's a good basic tool I could use? I've got at my disposal a diamond bit grinding wheel and a diamond bit for a dremel tool. I do not have a tile saw at my disposal right now, but if it came to it I could borrow one. 

(2) for some reason the cabinets on the left and right sides of the sink were put in at slightly different heights. The tile i tore out only went up halfway, and I'm thinking this might be why. Would it look off if i went all the way up to the cabinets on both sides? The way i figure, the left side will be 4 full tiles and then another 2+¹/16"" tile, and the right side would be 4 full tiles and another 2+⁵/16"" tile. Would the ¹/4"" difference be noticable? If I do scribe the first row of tiles, this will be a little bit larger of a height difference. But looking right at the sides of the sink I'm not sure it would be much more than the ¹/4.

I did look on google and and the sub but couldn't find results to what in my mind is a pretty specific question haha.

fovmn3,jakkarth,Doing our part during COVID-19,"Hello, everyone. You've probably heard about this virus thing. Wherever you are in the world, your local healthcare system is likely running low on, if not completely out of, personal protective equipment. These are things like masks, respirators, safety glasses, face shields, and nitrile gloves. And what community tends to have those materials on hand? DIYers!

There's a lot of information about DIYing these kinds of equipment. Some of it's good, but a lot of it is downright dangerous. Because we're not a healthcare sciences sub, we don't feel we have the expertise to handle posts on these topics. But we do have an amazingly generous community here, and I bet at least some of us have pre-made supplies like I listed above sitting around our DIY spaces. It doesn't even have to be new-in-package in many cases.

# Please consider donating protective equipment to your local healthcare organizations!

Hospitals and EMS agencies are at the top of that list. As a healthcare provider myself, I'm seeing first hand just how short we are on these essential items. Every donation will help. Call your local hospitals, talk to that nurse you know, stop by your local fire station (remember social distancing). If you feel comfortable, participate in one of the DIY projects around this topic if it's backed by a reputable agency (state health department, local hospital), but please donate what you can of pre-made approved equipment.

Thank you to the best community on the interwebs. Let's make a difference.",0,1585161678,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fovmn3/doing_our_part_during_covid19/,DIY,1

Kind of a weird question and I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, maybe someone can point me to a better sub. 

I'm in the process of home buying and I was just thinking about the WiFi and hoping that it wouldn't suck. My current apartment has a few walls between where my modem/router is and my bedroom, causing the connection in my bedroom to be about half as strong, if not worse. 

I've seen WiFi repeaters on sale for like $100+, but I was wondering if I could just make my own by running extra long Ethernet cables from one modem/router to another router acting as a switch. In my mind the connection would go

We are looking at temporary alternatives so we can still paint and walls and cabinets without the counters being screaming out of place.

foi9xv,dadoobie,Hanging a Plant on the Dry Wall Ceiling,"Hey y'all,

&amp;#x200B;

Not the most knowledgeable on hanging things on drywall and had some questions. So my girlfriend and I just moved into a new place and the whole thing is brand new dry wall everywhere. We have a ton of plants and in our last place we had even hung a few of them. Lucky for us, that last place was really wonky and had a lot of hard wood surfacing on the ceiling...this new place however is all dry wall.

&amp;#x200B;

So I got our hook screw to mount the first plant, spun it in at the desired spot and immediately knew it wouldn't hold. I can't really trust our stud finder as it also has given us some false readings on hard spots. So we started putting in plastic anchors that came in the Ikea Fixa screw set. 

&amp;#x200B;

We hung one plant and are about to hang another--and they FEEL STURDY--but I started doing some googling and am terrified at some of what I saw. There's a whole lot of ""NEVER anchor to a dry wall ceiling. You will be sorry!"" or that if you do anchor to a drywall ceiling it needs to be a heavy duty metal   anchors. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I come to you DIY'ers asking for any advice. Below are the pictures of the first plant we hung and the anchors we've been using. All of the plants we are hanging are about 4.5-ish pounds and the first couple that we hung with anchors have held...which in my mind I feel like once its up, its good. But I just need some help from smarter people on here? Will this damage the ceiling? Over time will that anchor rip a bigger hole in the dry wall? Should we just not hang them or will we be fine? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm guessing this may be something a bit more advisable? but how in the worst do you get that thing up there? We've had it for a while and never used thanks!

foey19,SheepGoesBaaaa,Using dowels (or other method?) For correcting bow in planks that are being joined ?,"Mobile not letting me post pictures, so here we go:

  


Situation: I have 6 machined planks of Walnut, 1500x120x26. I am trying to make a desktop

  


2 or 3 of the planks are not perfectly flat - slight bowing on the length. Left alone, it's about 1-2mm out. Depending on how I have the planks arranged, that difference could show in the middle or on the ends.

  


Light pressure brings the boards back in alignment, though obviously it bounces back.

  


I have a dowel jig, and am dowelling and gluing to make the desktop.

  


As the board's seem to be the same thickness the whole way, I assumed that once I had some dowels in place, that would hold the boards flat.

  


I did the first 2 boards, popped in some dowels to check, pushed the boards together... 1-2 mm still popping up on the edges - though perhaps less than before.

  


Ideally I wouldn't sand it or plane it to death to get it smooth - is there something I could do to have the dowels hold the boards flat? I'm using quite a few - about 8 or 9 along the length.

  


Should I try the next one's, and offset the Dowel hole by 1mm on the bent board so it pulls it in closer?

  


Any other thoughts?

fob6jp,TigerDropper,Advice on Refurbishing Study Desk,"Hey all, i hope y'all are staying safe during these times. Down here in Louisiana, things are rough but i think things will soon be better.

As the title states, I, along with what seems like a lot of others, am being forced to do my school work from home. As a student, my budget for a desk was inexistent however, lucky for me, my girlfriends dad had one in storage that he was about throw away. It has served its purpose thus far but after these past few long days sitting with it, i have noticed a few things that id like to change for the better and have narrowed down what i can do to two options:

**Option 1:**

*(1)* I would like to fill in the grommet holes that are pictured below. I have searched online for grommet hole covers for the size of the hole, but they do not seem to exist. So im thinking i need to fill in the holes somehow, and have no idea how to even start.

*(2)* I would like to change the color of the desk to match the drawers in my room. I am not very handy so i cannot tell you what the finish is on the desk. What i can tell you is it is a slick surface, almost plastic feeling. I think maybe looking at the marks on the desk could help a more experienced eye determine what the finish i have is. If that is determinable, or if im just over thinking this, i do not know how to stain for finish the desk, although im sure a youtube search will sufficiently help me.

*(3)* I would like to instal wireless charging under neath the desk, or hidden if possible. I was thinking maybe the grommet holes would a good location? Im not to sure, but this is lagniappe and isn't really necessary.

**Option 2:**

Instead of attempting to fill the holes and paint the thing myself, i have looked into getting a desk top that is closer to color of my other furniture. I have landed upon [this option at IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/linnmon-tabletop-beige-20353736/). However, this would require me to remove the desk from the stand it has which, again, i have no idea how to do. If yall have any other options or ideas via this route of things, just let me know.

All things considered, although i lack experience, i am willing to put in the work. Ideally, id like for the job to be as cheap as possible. Just let me know what yall would do in my situation. Thanks in advance, and find the dimension/ pictures of the desk below.

All measurements in inches

Desk Top: 48 wide x 27 deep x 1thick

Grommet Holes: 4.5 wide x 2.36 deep x 1 thick

foaktl,1dynamichuman,"After stripping paint off a wood table, and trying to sand the rest off I have paint residue on my sander. Is it a drying issue?","So I'm working on stripping paint off an old coffee table. I used a chemical stripper. I applied it twice. I then rubbed it down with odorless mineral spirits. I waited till it appeared dried, ""appeared"" being the key word here. Then I started sanding it to get the rest of the paint off and get to the natural wood. It looked like it was working but then I noticed the sander stopped sanding. Taking a closer look at the sander I see there's the table paint "" glued"" to it.

So I'm guessing the table wasn't dry yet, so that's why this happened?

So should I get a paint thinner as suggested on the stripper bottle to get the remnants of the paint off that I couldn't scrape off?

Or should I wait until it's very dry, then sand it down to the natural wood?

fo90bk,VixDzn,"[HELP] I want to build a railing under my desk, can't find any resources online","Hi /diy/,

Because my country is likely to be quarantined I thought I'd pick up playing piano again.

I have a full sized midi keyboard, but it's old and absolutely huge.

I don't want to be putting it on my desk and storing it elsewhere all the time.

I'm also a poor student so I don't want to shell out 100+ euros to buy a smaller one.

So I had this ingenious idea of building a railing under my desk where my piano can sit, so whenever I want to play keyboard I can just roll it out from under my desk.

Only problem is, I'm not a DIY'er *at all*.

So I thought I'd come here to ask.

The piano is about 15cm in height, so the wooden plank has to be suspended 15cm under my actual desk.

I was thinking of drilling planks under my desk that are 13cm in height, then attaching the railing onto that and having a plank with the railings attached...

Would that work? Also how much do ball-baring railings and the wood I'd need go for? Would that be more than 50 euros? I have the equipment (my dad has tools)

In order to facilitate this process,  I propose a DIY stimulus which would simply be keeping back some of our taxes due next month.  We know the feds would simply piss away that two or three thousand and then maybe send us back $600 sometime next summer.  Let's hold it ourselves and buy food for the family or pay the rent or whatever.

Maybe if these villains were not getting paid by us they would get the idea and maybe  start doing their jobs.

fo59z2,tcloetingh,My Window Restoration Project,"Wanted to share my window restoration project. I feel a lot of people could benefit from going this route. I replaced every pane of glass (IGU) in my condo for a fraction of what new windows cost $900 for 20 insulated glass units vs $8500 for totally new windows. Also need to factor in Rustoleum painters touch flat black one coat, brown paper, and painters tape. So all in like $950. OK back to the beginning… after doing major research on IGU (insulated glass units) I was able to purchase for pick-up 20 glass units at $45 a piece. Great Price. Much love to the folks at ASG Glass in Capitol Heights Maryland. Most glass contractors “glazers” I talked to wanted $75+ per. I had a glazer give me an estimate of $4500 for them to come out and replace the units (this does not include painting the frames). My frames were painted over and yucky, and the glass fogged up and in all ways compromised. Windows are commercial aluminum from mid 1980s. Relatively sturdy, decent looking, and air-tight. My units are varied in sizes but on average about 25” x 27” and 5/8” thickness. The glass units easily (most of the time) come out of the sashes without any issue. There are 4 screws holding it together like a picture frame. I reused the rubber/vinyl gasket as they were in great shape. I took apart 2 different windows first to get measurements of the units and also the amount hidden within the frame so that I didn’t have to take apart every sash to measure.  I ordered a test unit to make sure it would fit and it did. I put in the main order and picked up the units in my Toyota Tacoma. I took a full saturday to tape off the frames from the sills and put brown contractors paper around the sills to protect it from the spray paint. Tbh I wouldn’t recommend spraying inside even though it saved me hours of work, I did get a black film on surfaces close to the spray areas. Nothing ruined, you wouldn’t notice unless you ran a finger across it, it was easily wiped up from hard surfaces, but if you have a nice place don’t do it. Next I removed the paper and tape and moved on to replacing the IGU’s. Big problem…. Glass manufacturer made the units almost ¾” thick. My order to ASG was put in correctly, and ASG to manufacturer correctly, but the manufacturer screwed up. Hate to see all that glass go to waste, but small potatoes for a big company. Picked up all the new units and installed them all in 2 evenings after work with the help of my roommate. All in probably 20 hours of labor from start to finish… totally worth it in my opinion. Check out the pics to see the process.

fo1sg7,cXsFissure,Can I use my truss attic to store holiday decorations?,"I'm worried I made a terrible mistake.  I have a house that was built in 2017 in western WA state.  There is no basement and I'm orginally from the midwest so I'm used to having a big basement for storage.  Anyways, I'm sick of taking up half my garage to store holiday decorations (we have a ton).  So I decided I would utilize my attic because hey if they put my furnace up there then it should be able to hold some boxes.  

So I took out the blown insulation and added some thick R38 pink stuff.  Then I screwed in some 1/2 inch plywood covering about 15 or so odd shaped feet.  I was exatic.  But then later on thinking about it I started getting nervous.  I have a truss attic with 2 x 4's 24 in apart.  I started reading up on it and if I'm right I don't have rafters, I have what are called chords and they can support very little weight.  After doing more research I run into posts saying truss style attics used for storage is fine or I come across posts saying I'm in for a catastrophe.  I'm assuming they reinforced the section where my furnace sits then 

So at the moment I just have the plywood flooring in.  No storage bins.  So should I remove the flooring immediately?  Or will I be safe to store my holiday decorations up there?",27,1585039687,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fo1sg7/can_i_use_my_truss_attic_to_store_holiday/,DIY,1

The legs of the A will be 4x4x8 ground contact pressure treated lumber (probably from home depot), the beams of the A will be a 4x6 pressure treated lumbar also from home depot. The wood will be sealed/stained. The legs and beam will be secured into [metal brackets found here](https://www.amazon.com/Frame-Brackets-Complete-Mounting-Hardware/dp/B01M28VV0N/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=eastern+jungle+gym+brackets&amp;qid=1585000589&amp;sr=8-4) The play set will be in a grass yard. I will also connect 2x4s to the legs to increase stiffness.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning on doing 3 sets of legs with either 2 eight foot spans, 2 ten foot spans or 1 eight foot span and 1 ten foot span

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking to install various swings, rope ladders, monkey rings, etc using [brackets similar to these](https://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Duty-Swing-Hangers-Installation/dp/B01N4CNVVW/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=swing+set+mounts&amp;qid=1585000751&amp;sr=8-4). I want to make sure it will be safe.

&amp;#x200B;

The wife would like a swing to allow for multiple people to swing together and I want to make sure nobody gets hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are 

\- If I set up 2 or 3 swings on 1 beam, evenly spaced, how much can the middle hold? How about the end swings? How about 8ft or 10ft span? 

&amp;#x200B;

\- How much total weight can the swing set hold at once?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Should the beams overhang the legs at all? What would the advantages or disadvantages of doing so be?

&amp;#x200B;

\- I assume I cut the bottom of the legs at an angle so they lay flat on the ground. If I do that, do I need to do anything special to them to prevent them from rotting. Is a quality deck sealant sufficient?

&amp;#x200B;

fnp1df,zell2002,Plasterboard hole that previous owner tried to fix has appeared again. Need to fix for curtain rail bracket,"Hey all!

I bought this house last year and every room needs more work than expected.  
In this room I drilled in a new curtain bracket holder, a few weeks later I noticed it was sagging. Not only that but it looked like what ever I had drilled into was pulling behind the plasterboard/wall.  

I removed the bracket, and pulled that area out, and found behind there was just a cavity and some small wooden blocks. The wooden blocks is what I had drilled into, and they were pulling (from behind) against the plasterboard.  They were just free standing/floating in the cavity.

First video before i pulled out damaged plasterboard:

Video of how big those pieces were, and how they were not attached to anything:

I believe the metal, with the holes, is window lintel (catnic lintel?).  
On the inside right of the hole feels very firm like concrete or something. Above and below, in the hole, is about an inch or 2 before hitting more plaster (maybe ?)

The idea recommended to me, and that I've seen online, is to put a piece of wood in the hole, screw through the top and bottom of the plasterboard into that wood, then polyfill the hole. But with the limited space etc.. im unsure if thats correct.

Plus I want to screw back into this area, my curtain bracket.
I'm really unsure what to do. I'm not very handy, so unsure what I should try next.

Obviously my first thought was sealing foam, but after doing some reading online I've seen people say that won't stop them at all. Most suggestions say to pack the area with steel wool before sealing, but I've also had suggestions that I could mix poison in with the sealant.

fnmpbv,Loya1ty23,Improving Air Quality,"Hoping this is more active than Home Improvement sub.. 

Doing an overhaul on my basement and crawl space. Already plan to encapsulate the crawl space and get a heavier duty dehumidification set up for multi rooms. But these are ultimately addressing symptoms of moisture penetration issues. I've been following French Drain man online and like his methodology, but think some of the common hardware store material options will suffice for my problems. With that said, I'm trying to figure out how deep I should go with my french drains? 

My house sits on a sloped lot, with the front of the house upgrade. The back facing exterior wall is pretty much exposed with a walk out to daylight. With some proper regrading of the soil in the front, as well as extending some downspout drains, I will address 80% of the moisture build up issues (I believe) as the water will pretty naturally flow around my house and down the backyard. The remaining %20 is what I consider to be due to hydrostatic pressure that can't be mitigated with surface level methods. It's not to the point where water is leaking into the basement where the slab meets the wall so it's not severe (even with it being pretty wet right now), but the front facing exterior wall that is mostly facing dirt on the other side has high moisture content. 

Most insights online are that a perimeter drain should be placed at the footer, but digging 7-8ft of soil around the front of my house is less than ideal. Would 4 feet (halfway) do enough to decrease the hydrostatic pressure and allow the water to exit via the french drain to the side of the house to then run down slope? I couldn't find any reliable data on water table depth (the us geo site is terrible).  I'd hate to go through that work just to have the bottom 3ft of the basement wall still exhibit moisture penetration at high levels. Previous owner put coating, and it has begun to fail due to this. I want to frame and insulate the basement sometime this summer for efficiency but want to address the moisture beforehand.",5,1584980417,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fnmpbv/improving_air_quality/,DIY,1

So I decided to remove the architraves (I think they are called that) to sand and paint, however I messed up and didn't cut around the outside to separate the wall and paint from the wood, so when I removed it, the paint and plaster got pulled away. 

Can I just use Polyfilla to fill these or do I need something more substantial? 
Also need some tips for applying it, like how much of the current plaster do I need to chip away

fni3r5,quid-quo-pro,Accessing pipes from below through ceiling," Hi folks,

I'm completely clueless with respect to DIY so I want to ask the questions first before I waste a tradesman's time. I've tried searching the internet but I couldn't find a definitive answer.

A bit of background:

I'm based in England and live in a fairly old house. Fairly standard build, downstairs concrete subfloor and upstairs wooden joists and floorboards. Initially upstairs was all carpet but I had this replaced with laminate. This is all I could afford at the time as I didn't have the funds to have the boards or the pipes underneath repaired/renewed. The pipes run across the length of the bedroom.

I'm now in the situation that the upstairs floor is creaking to annoying levels in some areas, the pipes are banging whenever I turn on the heating and the artex ceiling of the downstairs lounge is sagging slightly.

This made me think it's time to replace the ceiling.

I'm wondering whether it's possible to do anything about the noisy pipes (perhaps cut around and stick some felt around them?) or the creaking floorboards, if working from below, after removing bits of the ceiling.

Removing the laminate is not really feasible since I have quite a bit of furniture and little space to maneouvre.

Has anyone ever found themselves in a similar situation? How did you resolve it?

Any thoughts will be much appreciated.",1,1584961258,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fni3r5/accessing_pipes_from_below_through_ceiling/,DIY,1

fnhedn,Hunt3r_3r,Need help/advise: restoration of a boarding house," Good day mates,

first something about myself, because it is important in this situation. I am 26 years old and live in Germany (excuse me about some spelling mistakes). I live with my wife and my 2 and 4 year old sons in a small apartment. We want to be part of a community and also found one. The community itself are at the moment around 6 (includes us) people, but we are searching for a estate. We found a very big one, but there is also standing this big boarding house from \~1965. We may want to restorate it, but we found much mildew in the house. The basement has much mildew (there was a swimming pool), the first floor looked fine, the second floor has already some mildew, because the moisture seeped down from the attic. The attic has various spots, where moisture came in from leakes in the roof. Also the mildew could increase, because the rooms were not ventilate or heated over the last 4-5 years. The boarding house has a old ventialtion system and a old lift, where we do not know, if there is also mildew. The house was also in some parts emergency restored, because there were refugees housed for several months in 2014-2015. These restoration didnt really help for our current situation.

Another thing is, that the whole house (besides the basement) is coverd with carpet. The rooms, some parts of the attic apartment, the old cafeteria and so on.

Only one person in our group (has also kids) has some experience with restorating homes. He says, that its is easy to manage the problems and we could live with our kids there in 2 weeks, if we all get involved into the project (we want to do it without any professional organization).

We do not know if we can trust on this statement, because I have no experience at all at restoration or work in this direction (I work in the IT). We dont have the money to live in our current apartment, commute to the ""new"" house and restorate the house for \~1 year. Some months would be okay.

Has someone an advice for this sitatuion? We dont want to damage our health, especially our kids.",4,1584957361,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fnhedn/need_helpadvise_restoration_of_a_boarding_house/,DIY,1

fnejti,toppuss,Applying Wallpaper Over Joint Compound,"Hi all. I have a long work in progress room. Basically, picture a wall with old, lead-based paint that was painted white with added texture before it was sold. I am putting up wallpaper in that room now and have encountered some issues. Namely, sanding down the texture on affected walls often left deeper grooves on the surface, and some pockets of the lead paint were exposed. As an alternative, I have applied a light coat of joint compound over the affected walls and sanded flat. My question is: will I need to apply a layer of paint before applying the wallpaper, or will wallpaper stick to the joint compound as is? I am nearing the end of a longer than anticipated process, and even with extra work, I want to do it right. The wallpaper is pre-pasted and has been behaving well on a wall with paint and sanded texted that did not need any joint compound filler.",2,1584940871,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fnejti/applying_wallpaper_over_joint_compound/,DIY,1
fnefrw,Wookiecologist,OK to remove wall?,"Hi All- I'm remodeling my bathroom and there's a door/short wall separating the sink from toilet/bathtub area that I want to remove. The wall doesn't continue in either rooms beside it and I don't see supports in the crawl space or attic so I'm pretty sure it's not load bearing, just supporting the ceiling sheetrock.  However, there's a joist that's joined and resting above this wall See first 2 pics here:

&lt;blockquote class=""imgur-embed-pub"" lang=""en"" data-id=""a/UTBziQu""  &gt;&lt;a href=""[//imgur.com/a/UTBziQu](//imgur.com/a/UTBziQu)""&gt;Removing Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=""[//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js](//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js)"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

In the drawing, Green is the wall I'm looking to remove. Light blue and dark blue are the joists that are joined and run together for about 4'.  If I screw or bolt these together over the 4' length is it OK to remove the wall?

No other joists are joined here, they're simple 12' joists.  The join is due to a skylight that was put in at some time so the original joist was cut.  Thanks in advance",7,1584940264,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fnefrw/ok_to_remove_wall/,DIY,1

fne6a9,Bertrum,Need help installing a pulley into my doorframe,"I'm trying to drill and install a pulley into my doorframe the problem is that my doorframe doesn't have a flat or even surface. It has another doorframe/bevel/ridge that juts out like a staircase pattern and it creates a gap from the original frame to the next one and it prevents the pulley from being securely drilled into place and will make it too loose or unable to reach the top of the flat surface. The pulley has to be facing straight on like in the pictures, I can't rotate it on its side so that its turned flat against the wood because it needs to be setup like a lat pull down machine at a gym. I'm from Australia and I'm only using metric measurements.

I have some pictures that I hope will help.

I'm using a zenith pulley that roughly has the length of 6.1cm https://i.imgur.com/XP0HB9F.jpg

It has three holes at the top of it, but because the pulley is too long lengthwise I can only really drill in one or two holes, the third hole is too far out. https://i.imgur.com/dsLZkXX.jpg

Here's a closeup of the doorframe the middle panel from one edge to the other is roughly 3cm https://i.imgur.com/Vkhh5gG.jpg

When I place the pulley up on there its about 4cm roughly from the middle panel to the outer edge. https://i.imgur.com/cmYGfzl.jpg

When I place the pulley up on the frame there's about a 1.5/1.7cm vertical gap from the pulley to the top edge of the door frame. I took a picture next to it of what you would see if you were looking at it from the side: https://i.imgur.com/WsSxA7E.jpg


Should I get a smaller pulley? Or is there a way to install it so that it doesn't move or wobble around?

When I take a wet rag to it, it goes away temporarily until it dries. I'm at a loss on what to do to repair this. Did I use the wrong Poly? I was told (Home Depot) to use the Polycrylic because it was best for creating a water proof top layer and prevent scratches. Here are some pictures.

fn9x82,donhuell,Can I install a wall mounted pull up bar on a stucco wall?,"Due to coronavirus, like many others I can't go to the gym anymore. Luckily, I just got permission from my landlord to install a wall mounted pull up bar. I'm thinking of going with [this Titan bar](https://www.amazon.com/Fitness-Pull-Up-Bar-Training/dp/B00HF8U37U/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KBEZWAAYJXW9&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=titan+pull+up+bar&amp;qid=1584920512&amp;sprefix=titan+pull+%2Caps%2C385&amp;sr=8-1).

Given space constraints, my only real option is to install this thing on my outside patio. I'm considering putting it [here (on the wall)](https://i.imgur.com/4gWBdbW.jpg) or potentially [hanging from the ceiling](https://i.imgur.com/vHjKRUj.jpg). There is about 8ft of space between the floor and the ceiling so I think that should be fine in terms of room for exercising. 

While there are a lot of resources online about how to install wall mounted pull up bars on drywall studs, I haven't been able to find anything about an exterior stucco wall. I'm not sure if I have wire mesh to worry about, or if I should just use a stud finder in the same way that I would for drywall. My house was built in 1964 if that helps.",22,1584920976,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fn9x82/can_i_install_a_wall_mounted_pull_up_bar_on_a/,DIY,1
fn9sct,EddyMerkxs,Building fire pit on old concrete pad? What to use for base?,"Alright so it seems there are a lot opinions of fire pits here so sorry if I say something crazy.

I have an old concrete pad in the back of my house for a shed. I don't plan on using it anytime soon, and a firepit circle seems like a perfect use for now. I would like to avoid destroying the pad, especially if I end up needing a shed in the next few years.

I could get a portable fire pit, but I am looking to see if I can build a simple one for a few hundred dollars.

The main thing I don't know is what to do at the base of the pit. Would a sand layer up to the first row of bricks be enough to reasonably protect the concrete pad? Or would a gravel/sand mix be better? Or fire bricks?

Besides the base, was going to get some pavers like [these](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Pavestone-RumbleStone-Trap-3-5-in-x-10-25-in-x-7-in-Cafe-Concrete-Garden-Wall-Block-92369/203158385) and [this](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Pleasant-Hearth-Infinity-36-in-x-13-in-Round-Galvanized-Steel-Wood-Fire-Ring-OFW815FR/301747084) metal ring and go from there. 

Or should I just stick with portable to avoid damage to the pad?

I’ve run into a snag...looks like there’s a section of the frame on the older fan that was nailed to the joist. Problem is that there is a 2x4 covering the nail heads (it’s a folded out section of the frame that’s housed at the intersection of the two 2x4s).

I’ve been slowly working on cutting the metal case with some smaller pliers. Is there something else I should be considering? Limited on tools due to the current...circumstances. Can make a run to a hardware store tomorrow though.

I've been meaning to create something like a mini-carport for my parking space. In the summer, the tree right above my space houses a lot of birds who shits a ton of crap on my car. Rather than having a car cover and removing it everytime I drive out, I want to build something which can simplify covering my car without building an actual shed.  

Here is what my space looks like
https://m.imgur.com/a/PONAHIO

I don't have alot of room but perhaps I can use the metal fence to hang something or as a base.

I had this as a concept  https://youtu.be/K8XWjF67-tA
As its portable and easy on/off but cannot buy it in Germany where I'm from and building an  actual structure maybe a no go from my landlord.


I also thought about having something connecting between the fence and the car cover and having a storage box on the floor below the fence and storing the car cover there when I drive out.

Perhaps I'm not that creative but all comments will be appreciated!

fn3n89,NotFromThe780,Single Handle Kitchen Faucet Water Flow Issue,"I'm going to start off this post by showing you a video I recorded of the issue. [Here](https://youtu.be/SPpdqGOA1JU) it is. Then I'll describe the issue and let you know everything I've tried. Keep in mind I am not a handyman.

So I was filling up the sink to hand wash some new pots I bought. Then the water started to sputter, the the flow was low compared to before. The whole tap and area around the sink vibrated. This issue happens with both cold and hot water, it doesn't matter how far each way I turn the handle. So I disassembled the faucet and tried to re seat the cartridge. Put the faucet back together and the issue persisted. I then screwed off the wand attachment so that just the hose for the faucet went to the sink. Issue still happened. I replaced the cartridge with a new one, issue still happened. [This](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/plumbshop-peerless-kitchen-faucet-cartridge-blue-1-pk-0630651p.html#srp) is the cartridge style. I took out the cartridge and I opened the cold water valve, I wasn't thinking it through and water hit the ceiling and went everywhere. The area did not seem to vibrate, and the water flowed just fine.

ALL other faucets in the house work as intended. The hot water source that feeds the faucet also splits off and feeds the dishwasher. The dishwasher works as intended as well. So I think I've narrowed it down to kitchen faucet. 

To add, if I have the faucet handle to about halfway before it sputters, the flow is where it should be. There just seems to be a threshold where the issues start.

Anyone have a clue? Could there be build up of calcium or whatnot in the hose from the cartridge to the faucet wand? Thank you everyone.",3,1584899110,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fn3n89/single_handle_kitchen_faucet_water_flow_issue/,DIY,1

fn1s7g,adozencagefree,I renovated my bathroom!,"Me and my wife bought our first house a little over a year ago. We had a list of things we wanted to work on but we quickly learned the shower leaked out the door wile showering. Though the bathroom was functional, it was pretty ugly. This inevitably went from ""replace the shower"" to ""renovate the entire bathroom""

[https://imgur.com/gallery/IfCJOrY](https://imgur.com/gallery/IfCJOrY)

I dabble in woodworking, but this was my first time doing any real construction. List of firsts include - Tile &amp; grout, Flooring, shower install, plumbing repairs.

Overall it went surprisingly well and the tile went better than expected. The biggest anxiety was that we only have one bathroom, so once I had the old shower out I had to get the new one in QUICK. what I didn't expect was to have issues re-installing the toilet - which would have been a bigger problem than not having a shower for a few days. I don't know what I hated worse - grouting or removing the old floor tiles, which were bonded on extremely well. But my proudest part of this is that I totally finished it (including punch items) in just under the 12 month anniversary of starting!

Biggest single expense (other than the construction-related cost of beer) was the shower - which cost about $700 from Lowes. Flooring was pretty cheap as it was a small area - Around $200 including trim and underfloor. I bought a really cheap tile saw on amazon for around $60 which was good enough for this project (and cheaper than renting one from Home Depot) I'm hoping it's still working when I start my kitchen backsplash this week. 4 boxes of tiles was around $250 - including grout and adhesives. Paint, tape and rollers was $50. Building the vanity was about $70 in wood, $300 for the sink and faucets. Mirrors were $200. Light fixture $125. Toilet flange repair kit was $20. Sharkbite connectors and pex to fix the self-inflicted leak was $50. Total material cost in the neighborhood of $2,025.

I have a few before and after photos in the link below, then the construction shots. Tell me what I did wrong! But, like, some compliments would be nice too...",151,1584892437,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fn1s7g/i_renovated_my_bathroom/,DIY,1

fn0uia,ClasOhls,Cutting away wood under installed shelf to fit a fridge?,"Recently bought a new fridge that fits horizontally, but vertically it's a bit taller than the last one. No worries, figured I could unscrew the shelf above and trim off the wood that's blocking the fridge from sliding in as all the screws holding the shelf in place would still be above the wood-piece I was planning to cut off.

However, having unscrewed everything and looked everywhere for any screws I might have missed, the shelf still won't budge, so it must be attached somewhere inside that I can't reach.

My next plan is to just cut off the blocking piece of wood with the shelf-piece still installed, while being careful not to cut any of the wood behind it. I've been researching for what tools could be used to achieve this, and found that either a router or some sort of Dremel multitool could possibly be used. 

My concerns with the router is that it would be really dangerous to use in a vertical position due to the vibration, and I also don't have one. My other concern with the Dremel is that it's simply not the tool for the job. It can be used for wood carving (and a bit of cutting too, but doesn't feel too precise)

Any ideas what tools/methods I could use to achieve this? I've been thinking about calling a professional, but with COVID-19 going around I'd rather not bring anybody into my home.

Pictures of the scene, with picture 1 showing the fridge to the left, and the others just showing the blocking pieces.

Well, actually a patio over unsettled ground. (In progress)

We dug a French drain down to the footer at the end of last summer. It sunk twice and we added more backfill. It's been pretty stable for months. We suspect it will still settle over the next few years.

Therefore, do decided to put in a patio with pavers instead of poured concrete (which would crack). The idea being in a few years we can take up the pavers, remove sand, add more gravel where needed, and put things back.

fmx9hx,atloo1,Is wood glue's shear strength enough for this application?,"My desk's edge is not squared off. It's trapezoidal. I want to install monitor arms for my displays, which clamp over the edge. I was thinking of cutting something to fill the negative space to create a squared off edge. I'd like to attach it w/ glue, as I'm an apartment dweller. The length of the surface that'd be in contact is \~ 3/4"". I'm concerned that tightening the clamp on the base of such a setup applies force that pushes the mount off of the desk. 

[https://imgur.com/a/ih0nJbs](https://imgur.com/a/ih0nJbs) 

Is glue strong enough that this doesn't run the risk of happening? Is there a different way to go about this (in the spirit of little/no power tools/ noise/ mess) . As an option, the mount can also be installed over a through hole (see the green circle). I assume it's an inferior one, but I'm throwing that out there.",25,1584869458,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fmx9hx/is_wood_glues_shear_strength_enough_for_this/,DIY,1

I was thinking of building the chalkboard featured in this photo. I got a list of the instructions on a blog. My main issue is about the plywood being used. Should I be applying a weather protector sealant and then chalk paint? Or is it okay to just apply the chalk paint to the plywood?  It wasn't mentioned in their instructions, so I just want to double-check.

BUT can we turn HVAC (like we buy in the store for our furnace/AC units) into mask inserts for these or even make them into masks?

The extra-strength pollen/dust/everything ones are a bit expensive, but it might also last a much longer time for daily (non-medical) use.

What do you all think? Would it work? Is there anything in those fibers that would be bad for humans if it was sandwiched between two layers of denim or flannel?

fmp1nq,diverge123,Attic climbing wall to survive social distancing,"Hello,

I am building a bouldering wall in my attic because all of the gyms in my country have closed and I would appreciate some advice.

 I have taken pictures of the space which are here [https://imgur.com/a/hVEmbhd](https://imgur.com/a/hVEmbhd). It also shows an outline of my plans for the wall with some measurements. 

I have purchased 10 122cm x 61cm sheets of 18mm thick hardwood plywood. I'm going to drill 12mm holes on a 15 or so cm grid, then place four prong steel M10 tee nuts in each of them.

The current plan is to leave the 18cm section as it is, as I think it would be quite a pain to add slats on top of it and it's not really that big. So unless anyone has any suggestions for how to deal with that easily, I think I will just leave it.

For the lower vertical section, there will be 6 vertical slats that align with the slats on the floor. The plan at the moment is to screw those into the piece of wood going the other way along the floor, but I'm not sure how secure that will be and additionally it will require very long screws. Also, joining those slats to the 18cm slanted section seems like it will be a pain, any suggestions?

I will probably place wood going horizontally in-between the existing slats, halfway up the main slanted wall in order to reinforce it. Although, I'm not sure how to secure the new slats to the existing ones. Presumably some sort of bracket? Could anyone recommend one?

Lastly, I will attach the panels of plywood to the existing and new studs. Which screws should I use to do that?

Apologies for all the questions. I have done loads of research myself, but I'm struggling to find the answers to the questions I have. If anyone could even answer one of my queries then it would be hugely helpful.

Loud, almost grinding noise

Noise usually occurs when filter is in place and door is closed. If filter is removed, noise usually does not occur. If door is opened for a couple seconds, noise usually stops, but may come back later. Neither the door nor filter are hitting anything. The door can be replaced with a sheet of foamboard and the noise will reoccur.

**History:**

Heat stopped. Technician came by to investigate, found dead blower motor, replaced motor with new one (Mars 10585) and capacitor. Furnace then worked but was definitely louder. Technician claimed it was just my perception and left.

Called company again a couple days later, they came out, said I wasn’t covered for “just noise” but shoved some foam board underneath the blower which temporarily reduced noise until 2 hours after they left.

Decided to fix it myself. Started by replacing the capacitor (JARD 12905) despite it being new, on the off chance it was bad and I could save $$$. Didn’t work, no change.

Figured the blower wheel had possibly been bent while swapping motor. Ordered blower wheel (WHL02353) and swapped it in. Noise is reduced a little, but grinding noise still occurs. Made sure that nothing spinning was hitting something else.

I'm at a total loss now. I've replaced all the mechanical components and the capacitor. Maybe the motor is a lemon? Something else in electronics? All I know is that it's driving me insane and the noise is keeping me from sleeping well.

Now that the spring weather has returned, I'd like to have my propane fire pit up on the deck, but unsure about the heat concern. It's the standard portable style fire pits. I've considered building an 18"" pedestal that the entire fire bowl will sit in to give it some extra height off the deck surface. I've reached out to the contractor, but of course now that the cheque has cleared, he's ignored my requests.

fmoput,tifu_curator,Simple HyperX Cloud detachable cable mod.,"Hello,
Recently my trusty HyperX Clouds developed a cable problem at the exit due to using them for travelling. The cable must have overbent and the sound was distorted. I decided to mod them to accept detachable cable as the original cable even though good quality was quite long and always kind of annoyed me when it came to store the headphones away. These headphones are quite suitable for this mod as there are really very very few modifications needed - the default hole fits the 3.5mm 4 pole chassis socket perfectly and is right thickness to screw the nut over and keep the socket very secure. For this mod all you need is a 4 pole 3.5mm chassis socket like this one:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B00419HD7E?ref=ppx_pt2_mob_b_prod_image
and the male to male cable of some sort, I bought this one:
https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B07KJPC94S?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title

Of course you also need tools such as soldering iron, flux, solder wire and so on, it goes without saying that if you never soldered anything in your life then you might want to practice a little before attempting this although even soldering noob like me was able to get it done.   
Steps:
1.Open the left ear piece, do it by gently pulling out the earpad then unscrewing four screws. You also want to undo two holes on the sides that attach the earpiece to the headband for easier access.
2. Before you cut the cable use the multimeter to find out which wire goes where - the tip of the headphone jack wire is left, middle is right and the base is ground. For microphone jack the base is the ground and rest is power. Set your multimeter to continuity setting or whatever it is called (should get number 1 on display) then touch each area with one pole of your multimeter and then the solder port with the other - if reading changes to 0 or almost 0 then you know current can flow so e.g. this port/wire is for left channel.
2. Write down which port is for what then cut the cable and depending on the length of remaining wires desolder them and use longer ones cut from old cable or reuse the already soldered ones.
3. Solder all the wires to correct terminals on the socket (don't forget about the microphone)  - again you can test which terminal is which on the socket by putting in the male to male cable in then using multimeter.
4. Remove the old rubber wire protection and slide the socket in - you will discover that it fits perfectly! Makes me wonder why they didn't add detachable feature in the first place...
5. Try to place the driver back into its place - I am not sure what the newer HyperX Clouds are like but in my case it wouldn't quite close flush so I had to trim the plastic tabs where original cable stop would sit a little as they were in the way of the socket.
6. Put everything back together, make sure you dont force things to not damage the socket, if the driver piece wont go flush just trim the plastic tabs.
7. Your HyperX is now even more awesome.

I plan to put one dual monitor mount in the dead center, but I also got an IKEA OLOV leg to add as a center support leg to prevent sagging and just make it more rigid.

Since I'll be using an office chair in and out of the desk, **how far from the back edge should I put the hole for the OLOV leg? I** want to make sure I'm not creating a weak point by putting the OLOV screw hole too close to where the monitor mount will be clamped to the back edge.

I'd like it to be black. Do I use spray paint? Or wood paint? Or wall paint? I am not a furniture enthusiast, I just want to make this table look nice.

fmhoe8,gr33n_lobst3r,Can you put down a paver patio before sod installation?,"I just purchased a new build house in October, we don't have sod yet. With a pending upcoming quarantine, I'd like to make use of my time. Should I wait to install a patio after the sod has been laid down? I'm planning on making a paver patio. The ground is a mix of clay and dirt, fairly level. My concern is how deep to set the patio, I want the patio to be at least level with the sod once it is laid, and definitely not below that level. If it is a littler higher that is ok. I am assuming the layer of top soil the sod company adds will have a bit of a grade away from the patio area (?). What should I do? I am open to the idea of a concrete patio, that I could later place deck tiles over.",3,1584808372,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fmhoe8/can_you_put_down_a_paver_patio_before_sod/,DIY,1
fmhf6y,BeramonNexus,Advice Needed on tap/faucet hose fittings.,"Hi Everyone,

I'm looking some advice from someone who is handy at some plumbing. 

I'm replacing flexible hoses from a tap/faucet to cut off valves, and I'm not sure if I have the right connector pieces. I have had a go at many plumbing jobs before, and something seems slightly off, so I'm hoping can tell me if what I have is the right stuff. I do have PTF tape for this of course. I have stitched together and numbered some pictures so you can see what is going on if you zoom in!

1) This is the valve I'm connecting to.

2) This is the bottom of the tap

3) I have these bits and I know how they go in, so no problem here, I'm just trying to explain everything.

4) The new hoses fit the tap no problem

5) These are the hoses and fittings that came with them

6) A probably unneccesary cloe up of said bits.

7) So the other end of the hose should be joined here, which means that

8) This is the only fitting I have that will join them, but this doesn't seem 'snug' enough, it screws down past the thread of the valve below...is this with PTF tape enough or do I need a different connecting piece to join the two? I've watched a bunch of videos and read some 'how to's' and no one seemed to be using a fitting quite like this, so it has given me pause. 

I know I can just stick it altogether and see, but I really don't want any near invisible low grade leakage in my life right now.

I appreciate any thoughts!

fmhev6,postandreply,I am thinking about making a cheap adjustable table and I'll probably screw it up.,"I want a table top that is 36"" wide and 20"" deep.

I  want the table to adjust from 35"" high to 50-52"" high.  I don't need in  between heights.  Just one height for sitting and one height for  standing.

My plan is to have less  than 20"" wide 1 1/2"" pipes to lay on the floor.  With elbows on each  end.  The elbows connect to the 1 1/2"" table legs.  Inside the 1 1/2""  table legs, will be 1 1/4"" table legs which will connect to the table  caps that are screwed in the table top.  I'll drill the holes for the  table height adjustment.  When I'm ready to stand, I lift table with one  hand and put two 20-24"" rods in the holes in the legs.  When I'm ready  to sit, I will hold the table with one hand and pull out the two 20-24""  rods.

So I'll need four PVC pipes,  four PVC elbows, four PVC table caps, a drill, some screws and bolts,  and two long 20-24"" rods.  Oh and the 36"" x 20"" table top, which I might  make out of a 1/4"" plywood.

But  since I never built anything in my life, I'll probably screw this up and  I'll have wasted all that money for nothing.  But I think it beats  spending $450 + tax + shipping for an electronic adjustable height table  that is not my desired dimension.  For that expensive table, I have to  use 24"" depth instead of 20"" depth and 30"" or 42"" width instead of 36""  width.  So that's why I want to see if I can make a table on my own.  It  doesn't need to be electronic or automatic.   I'm fine as long as it  takes less than 30"" seconds to adjust the height of the table.",3,1584807380,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fmhev6/i_am_thinking_about_making_a_cheap_adjustable/,DIY,1

I apologize if this is not the right sub for this question.

I'm working on a film set for a webseries and need some help choosing materials. I'm building a fake fireplace, and wanted to do fake stonework out of foam, as I need it to be light enough to move around as needed. 

I know there's lots of videos on how to do this, but I'm having a hard time selecting the right kind of foam to use, I'm worried the EPS foam will fall apart when I start cutting (using a utility knife for seams instead of going with the hot knife/soldering iron method for bricks with grout). But I'm also hesitant to go with APS due to the fact it would double the price. 

This is going to be filmed in low light, so it doesn't need to be perfect, so long as it looks convincing in the dark.

&gt;Hi. We are T.J. and Jen. First time homeowners, and first time home builders all within the same year. Almost 3 years ago, we bought our first house together, and only a couple of months ago did we finally moved in…. to an unfinished construction house with our adorable Boston Terrier puppy Oasis The Boston and our beautiful cat, Rori.  
&gt;  
&gt;After house hunting religiously for 3 years, we finally purchased a house with huge potential, that was going to allow us to continue saving for our futures. Unfortunately the high was short lived when a misleading floor issue was uncovered as a foundation issue and we were forced into the most traumatic, gut wrenching, and hardworking years of our lives. We did what we thought was the impossible. We cut our house in half, demolished all the bedrooms and bathrooms to nothing and began rebuilding… better than before. We thought that was the worst time in our life. But oh, how the universe was just preparing us for the ultimate blow.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rebuilding the house, proved to be an even harder hit. Sinking us to rock bottom faster than we could get the breathes out of our lungs. We had to give up everything we knew, for everything we wanted. But thankfully our story doesn’t end there.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rock bottom is in fact the first step in pouring the foundation for anything you want to build. We could only go up from here. And boy, did we.  
&gt;  
&gt;After continuously being disappointed by “professional work,” and getting a massive $10,000 tile job quote for install only on our master bathroom, we jumped on the #DIY bandwagon; uneducated, hands shaking, tears in eyes, and often with an apprehensive mind. But together we built our house, and are currently making it a home.  
&gt;  
&gt;We stand by our words: DIY DOESN’T HAVE TO STAND FOR DOWN GRADE. YOU CAN CREATE AN AMAZING INSPIRING SPACE, NO MATTER THE SIZE OR BUDGET. You just have to be willing to get a little creative, and a lot dirty.  
&gt;  
&gt;We built a house, but it ultimately built us. We proudly present you with our new project:  WE WOKE UP IN THIS. A lifestyle brand with a simple concept: Waking up in the midst of chaos and getting shit done, with a smile.   
&gt;  
&gt;Please feel free to follow along as we brave the unknowns, and fail our way forward into building our future.

fmfhli,Schpsych,What’s the best way to add a railing to a deck?,"Hey, all. I finished my deck last summer with the intention of adding a rail this spring. I initially intended to wrap the rail around notched rail posts that sat atop the deck boards (as that was how the old deck was designed) but realized after finishing that dropping posts through the deck and attaching them to the joists would likely be sturdier. But that will now be more work as I should’ve added the posts before laying all the boards. (See image below.)

https://i.imgur.com/KsZFUXD.jpg

My question is, is pulling boards along the edge of the deck dropping the posts through to attach to the joists the best approach to adding a rail?

Bought a precast garden table recently that I want to do up. It previously had a coat of black gloss which is just peeling off. I am going to power wash  it, put a coat of stabilising solution on, then a few coats of masonry paint. Due to it being a table it'll be subject to a lot of marks and scratches and the paint alone wont stand up to that very well. Is there a way of sealing it (lacquer, polyurethane etc) I could use that would still allow the whole thing to breathe while also adding protection from wear and tear.

fmbt9s,jacoby77,Scotchbrite on wood floors :(,"So as the title says I messed up and used a scotchbrite pad to clean a spot off my newly finished (about 1 month ago) hardwood floors. It didn't even cross my mind that it would be abrasive enough to cause damage, but sure enough I left some hazy scratch marks :(. I'm up at 4 am on the east coast kicking myself for being so foolish.

I've already done some research of how to best repair it and I may ultimately call back a professional to fix it up, but I'd love to do it myself (especially in light of social distancing). My plan would be to gently sand with 220 grit, then 320 grit. Finally, I would spray some semi gloss poly ([https://www.lowes.com/pd/Minwax-Fast-Drying-Polyurethane-Semi-Gloss-Oil-Based-11-5-fl-oz-Polyurethane/999913669?cm\_mmc=shp-\_-c-\_-prd-\_-pnt-\_-google-\_-lia-\_-219-\_-interiorstains-\_-999913669-\_-0&amp;store\_code=1505&amp;placeholder=null&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoYv3lrOq6AIVF26GCh2wVwxcEAQYASABEgJIzvD\_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Minwax-Fast-Drying-Polyurethane-Semi-Gloss-Oil-Based-11-5-fl-oz-Polyurethane/999913669?cm_mmc=shp-_-c-_-prd-_-pnt-_-google-_-lia-_-219-_-interiorstains-_-999913669-_-0&amp;store_code=1505&amp;placeholder=null&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIoYv3lrOq6AIVF26GCh2wVwxcEAQYASABEgJIzvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds)) to match the current finish and wait 24 hours.

Any thoughts on this plan? Thank you in advance.

fm80za,uglycurryogre,DIY Wind Turbine,"Hello! Thank you in advanced

I am designing a wind turbine from scratch. I would like to design 3 turbine sizes. Small to charge a cellphone/5V battery, medium and large to charge 12V batteries. From my research, the best way to do so is to buy a stepper motor, rectify the voltage with a bridge rectifier (possibly include a voltage multiplier circuit), use a DC/DC converter to produce a constant current/regular voltage, then a charge controller before the batteries so they don't get overcharged. 

Am I missing anything? I see that there are stepper motor drivers but I don't know if I need one. 

Additionally, how would I begin to select these devices? 

Motors:  
Here is a website I found providing a variety of motors (Amazon and Adafruit also sell motors!):  
 [https://www.ato.com/stepper-motors](https://www.ato.com/stepper-motors)   
But some of these motors do not specify their rated voltage. From my understanding, I need to select a motor that has \~200 steps (produces rated voltage at low rmp), and a rated voltage above the batteries voltage. 

DC/DC Converter:  
 [https://www.amazon.ca/DROK-Converter-Constant-Regulator-Generator/dp/B01EMYHOC6/ref=sr\_1\_41?keywords=wind+generator&amp;qid=1584684346&amp;sr=8-41&amp;th=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR3w2GBOYElkASn8bde4mPaoYX3WXJU1nnpE3EM8urwbT0kev3qtAjvDcrc](https://www.amazon.ca/DROK-Converter-Constant-Regulator-Generator/dp/B01EMYHOC6/ref=sr_1_41?keywords=wind+generator&amp;qid=1584684346&amp;sr=8-41&amp;th=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR3w2GBOYElkASn8bde4mPaoYX3WXJU1nnpE3EM8urwbT0kev3qtAjvDcrc)   
Would this following converter work for all of my blades? It says 5 -35V so I assume it would work?

Charge controller:  
I have no idea how to buy a charge controller :(((

Additionally, if I was interested in charging one 12V battery with two or three blades, how would I go about doing that? (Optional, just curious)

Background:   
I am currently in my last year of electrical engineering and I have a general idea of the above circuits but not much about the practical application. I understand that a solar panel is a better choice but the idea is to build a 'moving art' kind of statue that produces electricity. Sort of like:  [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2018/12/17/the-french-wind-tree-is-coming-to-the-u-s/#63d5e80ac7e0](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2018/12/17/the-french-wind-tree-is-coming-to-the-u-s/#63d5e80ac7e0)   
If you are wondering why a medium blade is required, it is partially for the aesthetics and also because where I live, the wind varies quite a bit, so a small blade for low wind speeds, a medium blade for most days, and a large blade for the really windy winters. 

  
If this is the wrong place to post this, please let me know where I can post this. Thank you again, I really appreciate any advice! After I am done, I want to make a sort of instruction manual so people can make their own turbines that suite their specific needs too! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I hope you are all doing well and staying safe!",3,1584758792,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fm80za/diy_wind_turbine/,DIY,1

fm5igr,lacampbell900,Murphy Bar,"Built this thing and installed on my porch last year just in time for winter. This is one of a few things I've built solely for myself. 

 The box and shelf is made of  1x8s, the bar top is 1x4s glued and reinforced with the sanded and cleared angle iron. The three boards on the front/bottom are mostly decorative.  The latch mechanism is steel round tube, round stock , and flat stock, welded with my shitty harbour Freight MIG welder. I stained the bar with Minwax Red Sedona and the box with Jacobean. 

I left the bolt for the latch bare steel, sanded with 220 and oiled with 3 in 1.  Just needed to quickly re -and and oil to get it working smoothly again.  That and the steel  on the edge should get a great patina after a while.

Everything bought as cheaply as possible at Lowes. Used pocket holes for the shelf, everything else was screwed and glued. I haven't graduated to fancy joinery. I used 1/8"" steel cable and clamps with some black shrink tube to lessen the chance of getting stabbed.

Sorry for the minimal progress shots. Pretty straightforward though. Attached to brick with 90 degree brackets and Tapcons.

My thanks to Sierra Nevada and Henry McKenna throughout the project.

My girlfriend and I wanted storage for small kitchen appliances and extra kitchen stuff. We don’t have too much counter or cabinet space so I was told to build something. It’s always a good day when she tells me to go build something. Haha

Made out of mostly poplar. Shelves are left over MDF from a previous project. Took about a month to make, working on it one day a week for a few hours. It was my first time making cabinet doors and biggest project I’ve built thus far, but it was a good learning experience.

Dresser itself: https://i.imgur.com/WhJqnGx.jpg

Hello all. I'm freshly 17 and still stupid, not sure how I'm going to magically become a rational genius the day I turn 18.

My mom and I just got a new place after going back and forth between motels and sleeping in the car for a year. So yippee. I was thinking that it would be simple (but time consuming) to buy some used furniture from goodwill and fix it up a bit and maybe paint it. Considering the current situation, we'll have to save money and can't buy a whole brand new set of furniture.

This however is a dresser my grandma owned and painted and it has to be really, really old. She died when my mom was 18 so I'm not willing to just toss it out and get some ikea shit.

From what I've read, I can do some sanding to get the gloss off and not have to use primer (?) But I would have to seal it I think with something.  I think polycrylic would work but that's from a 30 second google search. I'm pretty sure I'll be using acrylic paint.

And then, I have to buy some new screws for the top since they're all rusted and bent from someone being a moron and prying the very top off. Guess what, that was me. It was the only way I could fit it in the car and we had to rush leaving our apartment before eviction. We had a lot of stuff to deal with.

For whatever reason there are none of those rail things that enable you to slide the drawers out, you know, by wheel. Im not sure how measurements would go but I think that would be simple to install.

One annoying thing is that 2 drawers do not have the bottom part, so things don't disappear into a void. Like [_______] right? _______ is gone. So it's just [             ] :(

There are those straight small sticks of wood to seperate the drawers right, well the top one is broken. It would be easy for me to go to Home Depot after doing some measurements, but there are small square shaped pieces at the ends to fit in it. I don't know if they could cut it for me like that. 

I have basic tools, hammer, ratchet, screwdrivers, pliers, and an older drill. But I do not have a giant garage filled with woodshop equipment sadly. 

Any advice? It's pretty sturdy for being old as hell, but when my grandma died, one of my uncles got this. He treated it pretty badly and gave it to my mom. Other than that it holds up well.

TL;DR: 
How to seal acrylic paint
Rail thingys
Replacing wood, not sure if home depot would be ok
Any other advice for this thing

Sorry if it's a bad post, or something.

flj5bh,its_just_a_meme_bro,Need clarification on how to install gas strut,"I'm trying to install a pair of gas struts for a large but somewhat light weight cover to a DIY CNC machine but I feel like I'm misunderstanding a few things. The cover is ~25lbs (11kg) with a depth of about 34 inches (860mm). According to [this video](https://youtu.be/rL8soVSQS-Q?t=170) that means my strut should push about 175N (~40pounds force).

I already have a pair of non-adjustable struts from an old machine, each with a 15kg (~33lb) sticker on them. I'm not determined to use these but for the sake of testing I attached a single strut to the cover and found that it has significantly too much resistance which is where part of my confusion comes from. Shouldn't these be underpowered, not over?

Perhaps part of the problem is how I installed it? Essentially I just propped my cover open to the angle I wanted, attached the thicker end at the top a few inches past where [this video](https://youtu.be/YuJc85YCB0w?t=17) said to place it for a 90 degree open, and then swung the bottom into the only place it would fit on my rail.

Final note: both videos suggest a longer strut than what I have (60 and 50% the length of the cover respectively). However, on the original cover (slightly smaller but heavier) that these struts were attached do and functioned with fine, they only spanned about 33% the length of the cover, though they're slightly less than that with my new setup. How much of an effect does this have?

Any insight into what I'm misunderstanding is much appreciated.",4,1584656548,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/flj5bh/need_clarification_on_how_to_install_gas_strut/,DIY,2
flj1s8,ElOsoSabroso,Does anyone have any experience using Schluter KERDI-BOARD?,"TL:DR bought a flip, they didn't waterproof anything so wife and I are thinking about redoing our main shower ourselves. Thinking about using Schluter KERDI-BOARD (and specifically the kit from amazon [https://www.amazon.com/Schluter-Systems-Kerdi-Waterproof-Shower/dp/B07H4YSH3Y/ref=sr\_1\_11?keywords=schluter&amp;qid=1584655207&amp;sr=8-11](https://www.amazon.com/Schluter-Systems-Kerdi-Waterproof-Shower/dp/B07H4YSH3Y/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=schluter&amp;qid=1584655207&amp;sr=8-11)) . Anyone have experience working with it? any downsides? We're both pretty handy when it comes to DIY house work.

Longer version:

Here's the scenario - we bought a house \~1 year ago from (what turned out to be) a flipping company. Flippers were mediocre to bad at pretty much everything besides hiding their work, with the showers being a great example.

They ""redid"" the showers, but didn't do proper waterproofing, seal anything, or even tighten down the fixtures properly - which we discovered when water started leaking into the garage. The downstairs shower has what appears to be no waterproofing, with the plumber thinking it might be straight tile on drywall. Legal action is being considered...

Our plan was originally to demo ourselves, then pay a contractor to come in and do the waterproof work, then we would tile everything. Most companies didn't really want to do that, and the cost still seems pretty high.

Having not remodeled anything major in about 15 years, I was researching.

flg05c,_Slow_Hand_,Flush trim router bit damaging adjacent laminate.,"Hi everybody -- I'm trying to cover a small cabinet I've built with formica laminate and I'm using a router with a flush trim bit. The flush trim bit is doing a great job of trimming the laminate down, but when I go to trim a piece that is adjacent to another piece that I've already trimmed, I have issues with the bit damaging the already trimmed laminate of the adjacent panel. For example, while trimming the side panel edge that meets the top panel, the flush trim bit will mar the part of the top panel of laminate that the bit runs parallel across. 

Is this a common problem? Is it caused by user error or is this just part of it? Is there anything I can do to avoid this going forward?

flfqup,Gelesas,Need help: Preparing walls for painting,"Hello! I really hope I can get some help and I really don't know how to name this thread so I'll just get down to the issue.

LONG STORY, YOU CAN SKIP THIS:

For years now we've been having issues with my room's walls and there were some pipe issues that ruined them. We started getting them fixed by an acquaintance, but not far into the fixing, pipe issues came back flooded the walls again and the work stopped. We finally replaced all of the pipes so we can finally finish the walls. However we can't really hire a professional for a while and since I'm quarantined for weeks I decided that I obviously can fix it myself if I do enough research. 

SO. 

https://preview.redd.it/mfn8n0cpfon41.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd10ce69745857482e75d9b349d110d3b76810a8

The walls are obviously not finished for painting. I started searching for info on what i need to do and what to buy before painting and I'm confused because english sites are saying one thing and my first language sites don't have info or are saying something else. The grey stuff used on the walls is Knauf Rotband mixture and we have some of it. AS I UNDERSTAND before painting I have to put putty or a skim coat or something? I am completely new when it comes to this topic so please be kind xD

Questions: 

1. The walls aren't straight because the pipe leaks interrupted the work. Do i use the same mixture to even them out? 
2. Can I even do this myself or should I save up for a professional? 
3. What do I use on top of this?

Any sort of explanation would help me out a bunch, thank you for your time! P.S. yes, the whole is still there, but we put in metal doors.

We have had issues in the past with it not emptying in the middle of the cycle but letting it sit usually resolved it. We tried using it the other day and it would not empty the drum or turn, with an electrical burning smell. I figured it was the motor burning out so I replaced it with a brand new model. It came with a wiring harness, easy peasy, match the colors, plug it in, you get it. 

So I installed the new motor and when I click over to the spin cycle, it hums but won't actually turn. At this point, the motor is mounted in the washer housing but I disconnected both belts, thinking that maybe they were causing it to stick but even by itself the motor will not turn, just hums and gets hot.

At the start of the year I really (really) wanted to try my hand at refurbishing furniture. I had just repainted and fixed a small hallway console, which hadn't turned out half badly, and I suddenly was filled with visions of re-loving-all-the-things.

At the start, given my limited experience with this (read: none) this project was certainly a prime example of biting off more than I could chew. Thankfully YouTube woodworking videos are a very handy resource when you're trying to figure stuff out.

This is the result after a couple of months of weekends, sweat, and citristrip.

The basic design is similar to [this one](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/0210/products/IMG_0371_2818a746-0ed2-4fe6-87fb-72aaa9085f61_1600x.jpg?v=1488530165), but with the towers toed out rather than in. I have the entire thing designed and planned out except for one thing, the ""knobs"" that the knife handle and blade spine will rest on. [Here is an up-close picture of the ones on that knife stand in the first link.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1041/0210/products/IMG_0381_da6baf1c-68be-4b96-9e5e-0ff0820965ee_1600x.jpg?v=1488530165)

I have no idea what I would even begin to search for to accomplish that. Right now I am debating between using a standoff screw like you would to offset an acrylic panel from a wall or using a Chicago screw post screwed into the machine screw end of a dowel screw and then screwed into the wood. I need the posts to be at least 3/4"" for the handles of my knives and would prefer metal, although I am slightly worried about galvanic corrosion since they are carbon steel (depending on diameter, I have clear polycarb tubing I could slide over the metal to prevent corrosion).

Originally I thought about just wooden dowels, but I am using a repurposed teak chopping board and getting dowels that are even close to matching was almost impossible and I have no way to turn my own. 

Is there a specific fastener/hardware type that I should be searching for or are some combo of standoff screw/Chicago screw my best bet even though it is definitely not what they're supposed to be used for. I am open to any ideas as well if there is a better option than those two things.",2,1584593434,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fl46bo/diy_chef_knife_stand_knob_help/,DIY,1

I’ve reviewed tons of old posts and YouTube how to videos and I cannot figure for the life of me of how to get to the bolts, nor have I found any examples that look like this! What are they?? 

They seem to slide very slightly (not a whole lot of room to move there) and I am afraid to rip them off in case they serve some purpose.

I don't need the smooth one-finger folding action, I just like the angles and space that a fold-forward stand with two joints enables. If I can find some hinges that will work for joints like that, I think I can build a stand around them pretty easily. Any ideas?

This  short-wave ultraviolet light disrupts DNA base pairing causing formation  of pyrimidine dimers and leads to the inactivation of bacteria,  viruses, and protozoa. It can also be used to produce ozone for water  disinfection.

The word ""made"" is not quite appropriate in this case, because in order to get it, i had to break the 400 watt mercury lamp.

https://preview.redd.it/e7ppxj9yyhn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ed60542b08ab41f77d70e8c251ff5e3a365d6d0

It was a standard [mercury-vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury-vapor_lamp)  400 E40 lamp (400W, 3.25A, 115V). I put it in a cellophane bag, a foam  bag and hit it very carefully with a rubber hammer. As a result, it  broke with a ringing slap.

In order for illuminating lamp to become germicidal - you only need to  break the outer shell without damaging the internal heater containing  mercury.

With pliers removed the glass residue from the lamp base.

[According to Kreosan's recommendation, i thoroughly wiped the flask with vodka](https://youtu.be/WjKkgkbRSgY?t=85). If don't do that, he says - the flask could explode.

One of the edges of the flask broke off when the lamp was destroyed, but  the integrity of the mercury flask itself was not damaged. In this  photo, you can see the mercury inside it.

Powerful mercury lamps of this kind will not be able to operate simply  by connecting to the AC mains, but it necessary to use a massive and  expensive device known as a throttle (choke) to start them up. I decided  to use this simple circuit to start and heat this 400-watt lamp.

https://preview.redd.it/o6mhmh8czhn41.jpg?width=525&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f18de21f5a5352b7d70b77abe582120718adb1aa

[Found this schematic here](http://l800.ru/zapusk-lamp-drl-bez-drosselja.html).  Theoretically, using incandescent bulbs as a load reduces the life of  the mercury lamp. But considering that a germicidal lamp will not be  used for permanent lighting, but for occasional work for a maximum of 1  hour is a very acceptable solution. Here's the result after connection.  Used firewood as a base, where i fixed the lamp holders.

https://preview.redd.it/266p7z8ezhn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b495b20a911e9fd2cae28ebd76ac22e5bb5d3e

Twisted out all the incandescent bulbs before connecting them to the  mains. After connecting to the mains - screwed in one of those lamps.

The germicidal lamp (located in another room during the test run) began to flicker and began to gradually heat up.

After a few minutes, i screwed in a second incandescent bulb. [Here is a video of the load creation process for a similar lamp](http://l800.ru/17/01.mp4).

https://preview.redd.it/gkzvzw4lzhn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=715c43509651ab85fb885f1dc779358deb1d91b8

After 10 minutes, the mercury lamp was shining at full power, there was no need to use a third incandescent lamp for a load.

400-watt  mercury lamps for germicidal purposes are much more powerful than  commercial market options. According to some claims, in half an hour it  can destroy not only mushrooms, but even insects. For mammals, such  radiation is also very dangerous, so you need to leave the room during  treatment, do not look at the light and ventilate room well (even after a  few minutes of work there is a clear smell of ozone).

https://preview.redd.it/j6r4g3knzhn41.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05f64a6fe9d2f8d9c1d446bc3d22296cb203558d

Since i have a spectrophotometer, i decided to look at the spectrum of this radiation at the same time.

https://preview.redd.it/wg48wb9pzhn41.jpg?width=710&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65bcc83886bf2585614ecbb440d4068b08340a53

All the components for this powerful bactericide unit cost me less than $10. I did this installation not because of paranoia, [giving in to the id2020 promotional campaign](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fk1974/id2020_and_partners_launch_program_to_provide/),  but because i found the fungus/mold spreading in one of the greenhouses  before the season started. Theoretically, half an hour of UV treatment  will destroy all protozoa, potentially threatening for cultural plants.  This kind of radiation easy destroys viruses. [In the USSR, they illuminated children in kindergartens for prevention.](https://oadam.livejournal.com/434655.html)  However, under current conditions, this cargo cult often ends  deplorably - there is a known cases when not taking all precautions - [a group of children received visible damage to vision](https://www.interfax.ru/russia/105710).

fkxew4,ThunderDumpster,Best way to remove this old ceiling fan bracket?,"I'm currently in the process of trying to replace an existing ceiling fan mount with a Westinghouse Saf-t-Brace, and I'm comfortable enough with the mechanics of installing the brace itself and performing the electrical work (this ain't my first rodeo).

The issue I have however is that after I removed the fan and the existing electrical box, it looks like the box was previously mounted to a bracket that's been up there for who knows how many decades - there's some pictures below.

My house is old and has a tiny attic hatch, so it's going to be a real challenge to get above the bracket and perform a more detailed inspection.

Is there anyone who has seen these before who has some advice on removing it? I really don't want to hack it apart with my Dremel given all that insulation that's around it, as that seems like a course of action that's unlikely to end well!

Once the new bracket is up, will it be OK if the box is mounted so close to the woodwork, or should I try and cut a new hole so the box can be mounted roughly half way along the bracket?

fkvw7n,Harish-P,Want a future proof data line for AV receiver to TV... Running through brick wall,"#Facts

* Redecorating the lounge
* Planning to wall mount the TV
* The wall is brick
* Want to declutter the wires, aiming to trunk into the wall
* Thinking to use ethernet cable, ports, and converters
* Is this the wisest long term solution?

#The Story

In the process of wall mounting our previously stand mounted flat screen as we finish decorating our lounge.

[The current setup.](https://i.imgur.com/zydH9YC.jpg)

Forgive the perspective, had to go ultra wide due to how ultra close I was thanks to the furniture in the middle of the room.

We hate the cluttered 'wires everywhere' look.

On the marble, past the fireplace and in the corner, I'm working to build a unit that will sit there and manage all TV inputs. We have a home theater unit that takes all the inputs and offers only one output. This means as far as cabling goes we should only need the power for the TV and the data cable from the unit.

Problem: all the walls are brick, and we aim to wire from the unit through the bricks and into around the wall mount. This means we have one shot to make this work for the next 20-30 years (long term home). The guidance we keep getting is that we should just trunk a HDMI cable through, but if the last 20 years have taught me anything that cable will be old technology as soon as the plaster dries.

My thoughts are to run a cat 6 ethernet cable and have two ports by the unit and behind the TV to keep it future proof, Soni think it should handle 16k when that releases probably next year (/s).

I was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/k0hU8Ipx2XU) and am tempted to buy [these converters](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B07CN2G4Y6).

Some savvier technological people than me insist I stick to the HDMI cable in the wall, but it just feels illogical.

Not only did it end up being a bit too sharp around the edges, but it posed the issues of making the tub hard to clean and, more importantly, leaving room between the chicken wire and the bin where he might get stuck.

Does anyone have ideas I might be missing? I'm not opposed to building something. Drylok can make any material waterproof, but it also then makes it smooth and slick.",26,1584540965,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fkq6in/help_rough_material_that_retains_water/,DIY,1

The ceililng in the basement is already low enough that I don't want to raise it by pouring a slab to mitigate the radon.

fkp8md,cloudywater1,Wife bought me a record player.. looks like I need to build a table.,"I've always had an affection for Vinyl, I sold my stuff back when I was young and needed money. (totally regretted that move). I've carried my vinyl collection between 3 houses, 3 kids a dog and many, many years with nothing to play them on. 

My wife hooked it up and got me a really nice turntable, so i spent the next 6 months finding similar equipment to what i owned 20yrs ago. Kenwood tuner and Bose Speakers. Once i had the gear i realized that i needed a badass table for my gear.

I usually find motivation for a project to solve a problem, i needed a table. I didn't see anything retro-modern enough that i liked and was in my price range. So i decided to spend 3x as much money and spend way too many hours to build one myself.

Fun project.

fkakes,lwadz88,[A PLACE TO START] New Crowdsourced Organization aims to help entrepreneurs and founders pursue their dreams. Draft Pitch Deck Released.," 

Hey All,

I thought this was relevant especially since many of you are some what idealistic and entrepreneurial. If you have a project (business/organization/company) that you always wanted to create, but you are not sure where to start this may be worth checking out.

This new organization I've been following ""Crowdspark"" started as a sub, but then expanded into an actual project with the goal of creating a social media platform for connecting entrepreneurs with great ideas with experienced professionals across all disciplines (i.e. business, law, HR, finance , engineers, programmers etc.) in order to form permanent teams to actualize the idea.

Basically it is a way that you can expand your entrepreneurial network to find the people you need. It is not a freelancing forum or place for consultants, but a place that you can go to find people who actually care about what you are trying to do and are in it for the long haul.

Eventually they also want to turn it into a full-fledged crowdsourced VC fund/incubator. They now have a dedicated development team that meets regurally. The just released a draft of their pitch deck that you can read at the link below of their sub [r/crowdspark](https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdspark/).

fka7x0,spp41,Building track system wall shelves with super thick (double?) dry-wall,"Just got a new townhouse, and above the couch we were planning on building 3 wall shelves for books (similar style [to this](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9SuJ3UhvQE/)).  

So I went to Lowes and got three 64 inch melamine boards, two [shelving tracks](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Rubbermaid-FastTrack-White-Shelving-Upright-Common-0-875-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-Actual-0-875-in-x-25-in-x-1-in/3274255), and six [shelving brackets](https://www.lowes.com/pd/ClosetMaid-White-Shelving-Bracket-Common-0-5-in-x-2-5-in-x-12-5-in-Actual-0-5-in-x-2-5-in-x-12-5-in/3006158).  I figured the job would be easy enough - just locate the 2 studs and screw in the tracks.  But finding studs was surprisingly difficult, even with a stud finder.  We found out that the wall we were using had double drywall and the stud finder was effectively useless.  

We consulted with a freelancer who told us that using toggle bolts/butterfly anchors through both layers of drywall would be sufficient enough for the job, and that since the weight would be [vertically](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Rubbermaid-FastTrack-White-Shelving-Upright-Common-0-875-in-x-25-in-x-1-in-Actual-0-875-in-x-25-in-x-1-in/3274255) distributed there wouldn't be much of an issue.

I just wanted to get a second opinion on this above method since it would be holding quite a bit of weight (all books) and would be right over our heads for the couch.  I was also wondering if I should just more of those vertical tracks for support if going this route.",13,1584469392,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fka7x0/building_track_system_wall_shelves_with_super/,DIY,1

My house was built in 1952 and is a one-story house built on a slab. No basement, no crawl space. The builder did not install a vapor barrier under the slab so the house is always a tad damper than we'd like it to be. We have been thinking about installing new flooring but it occurred to us that if the slab was going to be bare for a time, why not seal it so the lack of a vapor barrier is less of an issue? So I have 2 questions for this group:

1. Is this a thing?
2. If so, how is it done? Do products exist for this purpose?",6,1584463431,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fk8fuh/sealing_concrete/,DIY,1

They measure 14X3.25, 12X3.25 and another 12X3.25 stemming the same main trunk. I'd like to just use one large vent opening on the floor. So how big should the opening be so that I am able to heat/cool that area the same as before?

fjzatv,aprendergast,Fixing Running Toilet,"Our toilet runs constantly and I think the parts need to be replaced (Our condo was built in 1987 and I think it's original). 

I was looking at replacement parts, but I was trying to wrap my head around how our existing parts work and whether the replacements below would be compatible.

Our existing toilet has two large cylinders. One to the left supplies the water, and another in the center above the flap. \[Existing Toilet Setup\]([https://imgur.com/a/gyBeCRY](https://imgur.com/a/gyBeCRY)). 

I'm assuming the large center cylinder above the flap is what detects the water level in our current setup, but I've not seen a toilet setup like this before so I'm not sure. 

The last time I fixed a toilet was with the rod and ball setup, so I wanted to see how the newer parts (see links below) work as far as detecting when the water level reaches the right height. I'm assuming that is now done inside the cylinder to the left that supplies the tank with water?

I've seen most replacement parts just have the flap without this second cylinder that our current setup has, so I wanted to make sure that one of the two options below would fix the issue and that I shouldn't be looking for different parts.

fjx9pb,FourOhhSix,DIY Bunker Apartment,"u/Gensi_Alaria requested I make this post, so here it goes. Going to skip the boring parts and pictures. I will do my best to answer any questions and provide more pics if necessary. 

[It all started with a crudely drawn plan:](https://imgur.com/xpHWDua)

The bunker is approx 15'x20', it was part of a purchased property and attached to the main residence. The walls are 8"" cement filled cinderblock, the roof is 12"" slab, and the floor ranges from 12-14"" thick. It was used by the previous owners as a canning / tornado / bomb shelter with a thick steel horizontal door. Don't know when it was built, but guessing late 50s early 60s. First things were cleaning, and spraying everything down with a bleach/water mixture. Once dried, any cracks were caulked and 3 coats of rubberized paint were applied. 

[Framing:](https://imgur.com/xpHWDua)
Standard 2x4, on edge in the stairs to maintain as much room possible. Everything was insulated with fiberglass and foam. A beam was added to help support the ceiling and 3 existing I beams (train rails?). Electrical / plumbing was simple, added conduit and chases for TV / stereo etc. 

[Entry:](https://imgur.com/HSDeCGT)
The horizontal door was removed and a 2x6 vertical entry was framed. Used steel roof and siding, a standard exterior door. It stays pretty cool down here, but a small AC unit regulates the temp around 60. 

[Sheetrock:](https://imgur.com/WZ8u6ft)

The original plan was pre-fab a corner shower, but I don't really fit. Used a 30""x48"" pan thats full (almost 8') height...

Using black / charcoal grout on a light tile is lots of work, but it looks great with the red glass mosaic.

[Lofted Bed:](https://imgur.com/JK2RelZ)

Always wanted a bunk bed as a kid, why not now? Queen size and about 4' off the ground. It also gives me lots of added storage area underneath as I don't have a closet.

[""Kitchen"" and cabinets:](https://imgur.com/LCdnZXN)

Things not discussed:
Plumbing / Electrical: The 2 lights and single 20amp service weren't enough. A sub panel was added (cabinet picture) behind the fridge to accommodate the needs. There is an extra 220v breaker for a heater, but have never used it. Water was stubbed in from the house via a small access hole. There is a small 10gal water heater behind the bath vanity wall. You can see the access under my bed in the sheetrock pictures. As mentioned a lift station / sump was added to get everything back to the septic system.

HVAC: There was 2 existing mushroom style vents in the ""ceiling"". 1 is used for the bathroom vent fan and one is used for fresh air. There is an inline fan that runs 2x per night and exchanges the air several times through various filters. There is also the mentioned AC unit in the entry.

Windows: There are none, we discussed options like solar tubes but I decided on Phillips Hue lighting. I can simulate sunrise / sunset and have lots of other options. Making a large hole might have compromised the ceiling / roof. 

Outside: It looks like a covered patio area attached to the house. The ""roof"" is flush with the back yard, and most people think the entry is just a storage shed. 

As I said, they only part of this project I didn't do was tape and texture on the walls. Everything from design to cleaning, framing, insulating, plumbing, electrical, painting, trim etc. was done by me personally.

I replaced the cartridge and it stopped for about a month until someone used the shower, then it began to drip again. I just replaced the cartridge again and there was no leak when I first turned the water back on, but I turned it on to make sure it worked, and it started dripping again.

The first cartridge I replaced was only about a year old. I had a plumber do it because I could not get the old one out. When I replaced it last month, it was very difficult to get out and there was a divot in the oval ring, but that may have been caused when I removed it. The one I just pulled out looked fine.

I flushed it both times. The first replacement I scrubbed the casing and let a vinegar soaked rag sit inside it for 30 minutes or so. This time I just wiped it out with a paper towel and visually inspected it--no signs of damage.

fjtdgc,pladin517,"Electric baseboard heater not turning on, need some help.","Hi All,
Looking for some tips on this. Awhile back the wife saw 'a flash of light, a bang, and smoke' and our baseboard heater stopped heating. Today I took it out of the wall, and I see a burnt plastic cap and some more burn marks inside the heater. Now I'm about to go out and just buy another heater, but I'm worried that this short might have damaged some internal wiring inside the wall or maybe even the thermostat? I think this because even though the thermostat 'clicks' when I turn it up to a certain temperature, there are actually two baseboard heaters in the room and both stopped working at the same time. I haven't taken the other one off the wall yet, I might if it would help diagnose the issue more.  
Would also appreciate a cheaper solution than buying one (or two) new baseboard heaters.

fjqc5y,GGambitt,Battery controlled TINY LED (strip) ?,"Ok so I want to make this board game upgrade. Instead of a peg hole line to count your victory points, I want players to have a led strip (ramping up from red to green over 12 LEDs).

I know how to power a single LED (or several, simultaneously) with a battery, and button. 

I also know how to program an Arduino board so that if a LED strip is connected, one button will increase the LEDs count lit, and another will decrease it.

Problem is, I need the entire thing to be super small. No room for an Arduino board, and power wise maybe a power cell battery or a single AA/AAA battery.

Is there a way, with no electronic board (and lots of LED soldering) for a single button (or maybe two) to control the LEDs powered on? I'm imagining this sort of knob that as you turn it, it increases current, and somehow that makes the next LED in line turn on?
Maybe somehow with resistors, or some other electronic component I don't know yet?

I tried and I can power 12 PICO LEDs (those 0.3mm ones) off of a single coin battery.

fjosoc,jezibeltires,Install HRV since I’m stuck at home 😔,"[this is my fresh air duct](https://imgur.com/gallery/QcloiJY)


I wasn’t to put in an HRV into the house, it is a newer house built in 2006.  We have an issue with humidity, when it gets cold out the windows get so much frost/condensation, we are constantly putting towels on them and it is damaging the wood frames.

I finished the basement last year, which is when I should have put in an HRV but did not think of it.

Anyways here is the setup;

We have a “ventilation” switch next to the thermostat that when activated seems to;

turns on the bathroom fan immediately behind the switch, which is main floor
Turns on the furnace fan.
At least I assume it is just the furnace fan.  I did some research and determined there is some building code that required ventilation fans, but most builders cheeped out and just put in a switch that controls a bathroom fan and the furnace, as opposed to an HRV system. not sure if this is relevant.

In the furnace room, there is an insulated flex pipe the comes from the outside fresh air intake to the cold air return on the furnace.  I can include a pic.  It appears to have a little bolt and wingnut almost as if there is a damper in there.  This is what I a most confused about, is this fresh air intake always open (except the possible damper)?  Someone told me that the ventilator switch would prompt the furnace or fan to bring in fresh air from a cold air intake connected to the outdoors?  But this doesn’t make any sense as I don’t see anything like an electronically controlled damper.

I can still access an exterior wall in the furnace room, so I can drill an exhaust hose.  Only catch is it leads to under the deck, which shouldn’t matter for exhaust, but if it does I can run it under deck to ‘faceplate’, which they did for our furnace and dryer exhaust.

Would I attach the fresh air intake (insulate duct) to the hrv, then to the cold are intake (where the insulated pipe currently goes) then drill a hole to the outside for exhaust?

 

As well any suggestions of units? I saw one like this 

[EV05 700](https://www.rona.ca/en/ev05-700-air-exchanger-09095076)

On the classifieds, only thing I am curious about is someone in the reviews says no ‘furnace interlock’ so I would have to have my furnace fan constantly running? Ideally this would be controlled while furnace is running or vice versa.

Here is a video to show what’s happening, [basement leak](https://vimeo.com/397898859).  I would like to make this room sort of a entertainment room but don’t want to put stuff in here if there’s a chance it could get wet.  It rarely happens but happens enough to be a small problem.  The porch above has carpet on it now but there’s a small section where the carpet ripped up and I can see the wood floor.  It looks as though the wood on the porch is the same that is the ceiling for the basement.  Has anyone ever dealt with this before?  If so what are some common causes and what would be the best way to remedy it?  Repaint the porch with some kind of sealer?  Caulk the seams where it’s dripping out of in the basement?  I’ve tried looking online for solutions but the only thing I can find is someone who put deck tiles on their porch after sealing it.

fjbbhg,glistenr,Finishing teak furniture that’s never been finished but has lots of water/cup stains and rings,"https://imgur.com/gallery/6tpqkOE

Hi diy

I have a question about finishing teak furniture. I bought a coffee table at a thrift store for a bargain a few years ago. they said it was unfinished and unsealed and that coasters were mandatory. I mostly took care of it but my friends didn’t. I now have some serious rings and water spots that I’m ready to get rid of and prevent future ones.

If I sand this down and start fresh with one of the many finishing tutorials on here is that going to work (provided I do the rest of it right)?

My only concern is that my table has water marks directly on the wood and not just on a layer of sealant or finish. Is a water spot ever going to be too permanent to sand out? My guess is probably no, just wanted to post my pic for some reassurance that what I’m doing isn’t a waste of time or going to leave me with something uglier than what I’m starting with.",4,1584316778,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fjbbhg/finishing_teak_furniture_thats_never_been/,DIY,1

fjadzt,NJKV,Refinishing Grandfather's Pool Table,"Hello All.

My first post here. I inherited a pool table that was my grandfather after he passed away. I would like to attempt to refinish the surfaces. I linked an album with some pictures of the surfaces.

It looks like the cabinet is just particleboard. It might have a veneer but I am not skilled enough to recognize that. 

The railing looks to be MDF, maybe with some actual wood or veneer.

The legs are plastic with a wooden post in-between them.

I figure if it is wood/veneer I can stain it and re-felt the pool table. I am not entirely sure of what to do if it isn't wood or a veneer though. Would I be able to paint it?

Thanks for your time!

fj8dmi,aaj94,I'm finishing my basement -- insulation?,"So, I'm finishing my basement to create a living space for my parents. I have already had full waterproofing done, that is, a full-perimeter sump pump drain, and a vapor barrier on the concrete walls. 

My original plan was to frame the walls as close to the concrete as possible (they are not plumb, so about an inch or two away max to keep the framed walls straight), and insulate in between the studs with fiberglass batt insulation. Now I'm reading that's a bad idea, and I should use rigid foamboard instead. 

Does the waterproofing 'cover' me so that I can do fiberglass insulation that close to concrete? I've kind of read some conflicting things, and my basement handyman helping me w/ the project has told me not to worry about it. OTOH, if I do rigid foam board insulation, should I put that directly on the basement wall (w/ empty framed studs in front of it), or should I attach it in between the studs after I've framed? 

For reference, I live in Kansas City, MO, so we get decent winters but nothing crazy, and moisture is about middle of the road (not as bad as GA, worse than MN, for example).

I've recently moved into a new appartment in Austria. I'm trying to figure out what cables are currently in my wall and which ones I can take out and use for different purposes. Up till now I identified: 

&amp;#x200B;

* Coax cable
* DSL cable

fj2912,Montford01,I've accidentally punctured the freezer compartment,"So I was doing my usual DIY 'defrost' (screwdriver and palm of hand) to break the ice blocks up.

I've punctured a 3-4mm hole in the plastic casing, near to the base of the freezer box in a tall-standing fridge freezer.

Almost instantly, the compressor came on and started sending venting in cold air, which made me worried. I now realise it may have been the cooling sensor registering the cabinet had been open for a while.

The coolant loop is attached behind a semi-transparent plastic facia panel in the upper 2/3rds of the cabinet. The sensor and cooling vents are in the top 1/3rd. So I don't think I've damaged anything to do with cooling apparatus.

I checked the rear of the unit, getting rightbehind both sides of the compressor with a mini-torch and the outer (aluminium?) skin is intact.

I managed to plug the hole with some contact adhesive; which has now hardened and turned the unit back on.

The fact the thing went immediately into cooling after stabbing the casing is what concerned me. It also seems to have been in a constant cooling cycle for the past hour.

Would it be more likely the inner plastic casing is more of a hollow liner, rather than being any kind of pressurised void?",11,1584283137,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fj2912/ive_accidentally_punctured_the_freezer_compartment/,DIY,1

I am wanting to remove carpet from my living room. I pulled up a bit of carpet in the corner (hoping for hard wood), and found there is tile underneath. They used nails and adhesive to get this carpet down. 

Does anybody have advice for this situation? I've ripped up carpet in this house, but fortunately found hard wood flooring which made things slightly easier to deal with. I have googled the issue but couldn't find a straightforward answer. Would hiring a professional be in my best interest?

fiw7wk,scatmanFATMAN,Subfloor and Tile Question,"I'm doing a kitchen remodel and putting ceramic tile in the kitchen. The floor that was on originally was 3/4"" hardwood, 1/2"" plywood subfloor, and probably like 3/8"" vinyl (I don't know exactly) My house was built in 1966 so I guess they used 1/2"" subfloor back then.

After reading that 1/2"" subfloor is no good for tile (or even in general), I decided to get 15/32"" plywood to put on top, and then I'll do 1/4"" cement board before the tile goes on, because I wouldn't like to make the floor much higher than the floor in the rest of the house.

I put one 4x8 piece of plywood down on top of the 1/2"" and had a moment of doubt and want to make sure I'm on the right track before moving forward.

I'm gluing using liquid nails glue, screwing using deck screws, offsetting the joints from the subfloor underneath, and am not screwing the 2nd subfloor into the joists. However, I've read mixed discussions about screwing into the joists. I've had a few screws that didn't countersink all the way because the first 1/2"" plywood is older. I'd need to get the countersinking drill bit now, but is this ok? Should I screw the 2nd piece of plywood into the joists too?

From what I've read, the reason to screw into the field is to decouple the tile from the floor so expansion/contraction doesn't affect the tile so much. But if I'm putting cement board on too, then won't that be decoupled? Is there a good reason to have the 2nd plywood floor decoupled and the cement board decoupled?

fiusha,viktor72,Advice for cleaning a natural sponge?,"Hello, I picked a grass sponge up off the beach near Tarpon Springs, Florida. It's quite a large sponge and a bit delicate. It likely was sitting in the sun for some time on the beach. When I got it home I rinsed it and soaked it overnight and rinsed it again but I had to fly home so I dried it and put it in my luggage. Once home I noticed it was developing some slimy substance, possibly mildew (though natural sponges are supposed to have enzymes that prevent mildew build up). The white exterior tissue was also not entirely removed because it had hardened on in the sun when the sponge was basking several times. I put it in baking soda to get rid of the smell and soaked it overnight. I rinsed it again and again til the water ran cleanish then put it in a solution of hydrogen peroxide, vinegar and water to soak. I soaked it overnight and ran a toothbrush on it trying to scrub off all the tissue and slime. I was reasonably successful. I put it back to soak in the solution. 

So my question is, what should my next step be? If I can't seem to remove all of the slime and white tissue with a second soak, what else could I soak it in to get it off? I also read online (there are only a few guides out there) that after I do get it clean I should run it in a soda solution which will lighten the sponge as it reacts with the acid. What kind of soda solution would you recommend?

I'm trying to get the sponge to turn out like the ones I bought in Tarpon Springs but without spending the massive amount of money it costs to buy sponges from stores there. Thanks!",1,1584241521,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fiusha/advice_for_cleaning_a_natural_sponge/,DIY,1

fis5xr,carls_the_third,Pressure fitting separating from p trap when garbage disposal turned on,"We recently had a sink installed that sits a few inches lower than the old one. To accommodate, I added an extension to the p trap to lower it in line with the new location of the garbage disposal drain. I also added an elbow to replace the old T because we went from a dual to single basin.  The two white PVC sections in the picture are new.

The drain seemed to be working fine with just the sink running. I even tugged on all of the connections by hand to make sure they were tight. When I used the garbage disposal, the connection with the red arrow burst off and started spraying water everywhere. I have no idea what I did wrong. I reinstalled the fitting and it feels tight again, but I'm too nervous to use the sink until I understand what's going on. Am I missing something here? Is there a different part I should be using or is this setup ok? I'm kind of at a loss, so any input would be appreciated.

fip2n7,mikes2123,Anyone want to help a novice figure out how to dismantle a wheelbarrow?,"I have this old wheelbarrow that I’m trying to dismantle but I’m running into a few snags:

1) I don’t know what I’m doing
2) It has really old rusted nuts and bolts (long) holding it together...
3) I have tried numerous tools to dismantle it, including:

a) a socket wrench (but the bolts are too long)
b) a combination wrench (the bolt just spins in place and the nut never comes off)
c) a vice grips on one side + screw driver on the other (there’s not a good slit on the one side to use a flathead)
d) a hammer (the bolt is too strong that I couldn’t break it)

I don’t have a saw to try.

I’m sure I’m missing something but can anyone offer some guidance? Here are some photos: https://imgur.com/a/0MNrXht

fid3zf,mattzuba,Ideas for removing pipe nipple from shower drop elbow,"So I thought I would do a quick 15 minute project of replacing the shower head in my master bathroom.  The old one used a flush-mounted 90 degree mount with a handheld shower head.  The new one was going to be mounted off a standard shower arm.  I was able to easily remove the flush mount, only to be met with what appears to be a galvanized nipple that won't budge (I assume galvanized because it doesn't seem to mar like I've seen brass or copper do; and the rust or other build up inside of it is unbelievable - no wonder our water pressure sucked).  I tried using a pipe nipple remover from Home Depot to no avail.  Are there any easy solutions to this problem that don't involve removing drywall and installing a new drop elbow?

fibqn9,grevenilvec75,Need ideas for a Hardware Store Warhammer,"What I've come up with so far:  

3ft long 3/4 inch galvanized pipe as a handle.  A tee screwed on the top.  I have one of those female threaded trailer balls that will be the hammer head.  I'm going to get a piece of all thread (3/4-10 threads) about 6 inches long to go through the tee and screw into the trailer ball.  

I'm having problems figuring out what to put on the other end of the tee.  There doesn't seem to be any large 3/4 female (or male.  I can use a coupler nut if necessary) threaded spikes one can buy (and believe me I've looked).

We have a concrete patio, and there is wood decking above for our upstairs neighbor, which would allow us to enclose this area - but we can't screw into anything or make permanent alterations to anything in the exterior.

My first thought was something like the Zipwall system used for sheeting off areas for renovation, but I'm thinking just making a large wooden frame, screen it, and then figure out how to pressure mount it with something like the spindle rods used on baby gates (but then I have a gap to fill), or have it be free standing using legs on the patio side for support, and wood blocks at the top behind the upper decking to prevent it from being tipped forward.

Any clever thoughts on how to screen such an area without screws or other types of attachments?",17,1584120018,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fi36qs/creating_a_temporary_screen_for_condo_patio/,DIY,1

I'm having an issue with a new light fitting in the living room, it's a two light setup (Phillips dimmable LED) on the ceiling, switches on fine with the living room switch but turns on at half brightness and flashes when I turn on the hallway light. The hallway light (LED) also flashes but is at full brightness. The hallway light doesn't work if the living room light is on. 

I hope that makes sense. I've checked the connections in the fitting and as far as I can tell there's no wires touching that shouldn't be.",4,1584099398,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhy98m/problem_with_new_light_fitting/,DIY,1

fhx68p,mindovermatterlondon,DIY/Hackers Against Coronavirus,"The US has less than 100k full mechanical ventilators, each patient needs around 2 weeks of life support. There will be a minimum of 4.8M hospitalizations and 10%+ of hospitalizations require ventilation, so for every 10 people that need life support, 1 gets life support.  Of those 1/10, 80% of them will die anyway. Those infection numbers were calculated based on the US acting rationally and actually trying to contain it so they may be short by 10x. The point is in about 10 days the hospital system will be overrun, we are about one week behind italy in the US.  Experts are projecting a 20-70% global infection rate and before containment failed, they predicted 500k dead in the US, the real number could easily be 10x.

&amp;#x200B;

All hackers should be full time creating ventilators, a good model is the MIT project:

[https://web.mit.edu/2.75/projects/DMD\_2010\_Al\_Husseini.pdf](https://web.mit.edu/2.75/projects/DMD_2010_Al_Husseini.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

It may be possible to place 10x bag/valve ventilators on a single cam to drop costs, if no feedback loop or control was used (not sure if realistic) and a tidal volume/rate was hard set by mechanical movement, the cost per ventilation tube output could be as low as 5$.  We need to develop a system which can mate directly to off the shelf BVMs and is rapid to mass produce without requiring global supply chains and just in time delivery.",8,1584093156,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhx68p/diyhackers_against_coronavirus/,DIY,1

fhx1wk,Fraysa,How to mount arc reactor replica to my chest?,"I found an old Iron Man arc reactor replica that I want to mount onto my chest like in the movie for a costume party I’m attending. The problem is - I can’t find the metal straps that came along with it and I have no idea how to do it. 

I only have household items and there are no stores open due to the coronavirus. Any pro DIYer that has an idea how to achieve this?

I’ve attached photos of the device front and back. The back is a metal piece that has 4 cutouts (one for the cable) that was used for the straps. The glue was from an old project where I wanted to frame this. 

I want this to be attached to the middle of my chest as close as possible and wear a black T-shirt over it so it can shine through. I want it to be as stable as possible.

I mentioned ripping down some boards we have and making temporary wood panels to be the walls until the house is appraised, toss a rug on the subfloor, and cover the ceiling. 

I also mentioned the starched fabric wall coverings over quickly installed osb walls, which we could also do on the ceiling.

fhsnna,Shmamalamadingdong,Outdoor Electrical outlet not resetting?,"Howdy, DIY, hoping y'all can give me some advice before I have to call an electrician.  


Little backstory: House was knob and tube wiring before we moved in, but we bargained a sales condition to get it all replaced. Cool.  
However, the first electrician the sellers hired was just some Joe off the streets. No permits, no license... Cheapest way they could go.... Well, our realtor walked in on this guy fucking off after he'd fallen through the ceiling... yadda yadda, Sellers got a new electrician. I know this guy was licensed and a had a little more wherewithal, but I don't think this guy did a very good job either. We've had many outlets blow, a bunch of problems with grounding, etc, etc...  


All that to say, the electrician was supposed to also run a wire out to the garage so I could use some power tools without running a ridiculous extension cord out a window. Not two years later, the garage has no power and the gfci outlet on the outside of the house is solid red and can't be reset.

&amp;#x200B;

So! Is there something I can do about this? I've seen recommendations online to simply replace the outlet, but I don't know if that's enough, seeing as how the garage has no power and is split off from that same line, I think.  


Any thoughts or advice? TIA",12,1584067186,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhsnna/outdoor_electrical_outlet_not_resetting/,DIY,1

fhs9gd,HozHozAU,Need help fixing bowed out raised garden beds,"Hi reddit, I need some help! I built some raised garden beds a few years ago and over time they've bowed out at the tops and I want to fix it. There's a picture in the link below but to be honest they've bowed much worse than what it appears in the pic. The beds are empty now, luckily I had another use for the soil already in there.

The posts are sunk in twice as deep as they are high, in heavy clay soil, but without concrete footings. The person that helped me build it (much more knowledgeable than I on this sort of thing) thought they would hold but evidently not. He was a family member of my now ex so I no longer have access to him for any further advice.

I did some googling and saw a suggestion of using threaded rods to connect the top of the posts then some sort of bolt on each end to push the tops back together. Would that work? Would I be able to get the bolts on tight enough to force the posts back to being straight? 

Or does anyone else have any other ideas? Please ELI5 because I'm pretty useless at this sort of thing. Thanks!

fhmkwr,JamesE1978,How to hide staples in fabric lined cabinet?,"Hi all.

So I've lined an old book cabinet with black velour as I intend to use it as a cheap whisky display cabinet.

I now have visible staples as had to use three pieces of fabric, so have lines of staples around each edge. I was planning on using led lights to cover the staples, but as most rope lighting seems to be white, it would be visible and wouldn't look right. What would be the easiest way to cover them?

Any help would be great.",9,1584043451,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhmkwr/how_to_hide_staples_in_fabric_lined_cabinet/,DIY,1

fhlpkq,Squidtown,Pea gravel backyard in a rental,"Hello! I've spent hours trying to figure this out and I think there's probably a solution I'm completely overlooking. 

I have a backyard that is a field of brown gravel. It's low maintenance, but it is horrible to walk on and looks bad. I've put in a few planter boxes and I'd love to have a patio next. Considering it's a rental unit, I can't install anything permanent.  I have an outdoor rug so far and it just...doesn't look too great.  

I'm really interested in some deck tiles (the wooden or ceramic snap lock type), but I know a hard even surface is required. Is there something I can lay on top of the gravel first? Would something like the TrueGrid paver tiles work? I'd like to avoid removing and storing gravel since I'll need to put it back when I move out. 

Thank you! I promise to post pictures of the final result after I figure out what to do.",21,1584040263,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhlpkq/pea_gravel_backyard_in_a_rental/,DIY,0

fhld73,lee5432,Aluminium vs steel for making kitchen shelf,"I have a very similar kitchen to this and want to install a shelf on my splashback like the one here  (which appears to be a piece of angle iron). I would store drinking glasses, and spice jars and other frequently used light items on it to free up space in my cabinets.

I found a place that can bend sheets of metal to size. I am leaning on aluminium as it is is light and easy to drill the holes for installation. A friend told me that aluminium is rough and scratches easy and i should rather get mild steel and coat it, or stainless steel. 

I want to get a length of 2300mm x 130mm x 130mm and a piece of steel that big would be very heavy  I would imagine, and steel can also scratch.

I am covering that with geo fabric, then putting the soil back on top.

For my downspouts though, should I do solid pipe or slotted pipe? And if I do slotted, should I put stone down first? As you can see in the pictures, it is all sloped from the downspout to where I am diverting the water.

fhfk3i,IronMew,Permanently adapting one specific pan to an induction stovetop,"I'm replacing the horrible resistive stovetop that came with my flat with an IKEA Bejublad inductive one. All of my cookware is of the cheap kind with aluminium bottoms, so I'm giving all of it away and replacing it with AmazonBasics induction-compatible cookware (still cheap, though not quite as much).

There is, however, one pan that I have particular fondness for - [a cute little low-height 14cm ""skanka""](https://i.imgur.com/iFwaFGk.jpg) that I got at IKEA. I like to use it for eggs as the low walls make it easy to get in with a silicone spatula and manipulate the stuff cooking inside.

However, it isn't induction-compatible. 

I know there are adapters on sale, basically steel discs that you put on your stovetop and that you put your pans on top, but I don't really want another tool to get in the way when I don't need it.

I'm thinking a circle cut out of steel sheeting mated to the pan ought to fix the problem. However, I don't happen to have an AC TIG welder available, so I can't weld the steel to the aluminium pan.

My next thought was thermal epoxy, but that's made to withstand your typical CPU heatsink temperatures, not the 300+°C that a pan can easily be subjected to. But perhaps there are epoxies that can take it?

I also don't know what thickness the steel should be. It's supposed to transfer heat to the bottom, not retain it, so perhaps 3mm would do? I'm not really sure here.

I really would like to keep this pan rather than get another one, partly because of stubborn affection and partly because it's difficult to find others that are both this small and this low-height.

Finally found a spot in my house that has a neutral wire so I went in for the kill. Turned off the breaker, connected some wires and voila! It didn't work.

Not only did it not work, but the light suddenly stopped coming on entirely. There are two switches to this one light, and before I touched them either one would turn this light on or off, regardless of the other's state. Now the one I was tinkering with will only turn on the light if the other is on. It makes absolutely no sense to me, as all I did was flip the breaker, and transfer the copper wires to a new wall switch and then back. How could this have messed up the way my light works? For a while it just plain would not turn on, and kind of flickered every ten seconds or so, but now it's at least completely on or completely off.

Someone help me.",50,1584006895,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fhdwn2/was_trying_to_install_a_smart_switch_and_somehow/,DIY,1

This is in a basement 3-piece bath. The drop ceiling that was there before wasn’t anywhere near the joists or these partition things - they weren’t blocking much air flow, if that’s the point. The new ceiling will be 1.5” below the joists, and thus still have a gap below them.

Ideally I'd like to remove one (or both?) of them, as they are in the way of where I'd like to run exhaust ducting and an upstairs drain line. Even moving them closer to the duct would be fine for the drain line.

The duct in the rear of the photo has no openings above it. There is no difference in the duct from the joist gaps with and without the partition things.

My thinking was that it can be done if my goal is just the water ripple effect and some lighting. I should only need a couple inches of water. I don't need it flush against the ceiling, so it can't be slid into a frame attached to joists. I don't need any design or anything interesting to look at through the pane. I just want the ripple and lighting effect.

So my initial plan was fiberglass, just one pane on the bottom. The casing, whatever is waterproofed and can open up for cleaning. I can build a frame to slide it into place. Perhaps a valve to allow wetvac to extract water, make it much lighter before taking down for cleaning. I'm thinking I will need a small filter, if just to circulate the water. The LED lighting should be hard but would still like ideas (are there waterproof solutions?), ideally I'd like soft lighting all around.

Anyway what do y'all think? Can it be done and done safely? Is fiberglass good for this? Are there filters that work in a few inches of water lol?",10,1583965939,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fh5r8d/help_id_like_to_do_a_poor_mans_version_of_this/,DIY,1

fh592a,SlipperyAnnie,Question on Tub Tile Surround (Contractor Install),"When the contractor left today, I noticed this weird sliver of tile that sticks out like a sore thumb to me. I called the company and they said that the installer was matching the grout lines of the staggered tile. While I understand that, the niche as the focal point of the bath area, so it's really strange placement for a sliver of a tile (when no other tiles this small are anywhere on the tub.) I have the option to swap out with one tile, but grout lines won't match. Should I leave as-is or swap out with one solid tile even though grout lines won't match? Did they just plan out the tile placement poorly?

ETA: The tub is 60 x 30, and the niche appears to be off center, most likely due to beam placement?

We had very old melamine countertops  with tiled egdes that were  starting to break so we wanted to update  without spending a king's  ransom. We decided to give epoxy a try and I'm  glad we did, it was a  very fun experience with my wife!

I got a Sony KD65XD7505 and just moved into a new house together with my gf. At a friends house she saw ambient Lighting for the first time (it was the official setup). Since that day she wants a new TV with these lights on, but I don't want to my 2 year old 65"" to leave me just yet. So I did some research about DIY Ambient Lights. What I want are synced led to the shown picture of the TV. 
I DON'T WANT JUST LED STRIPES ON THE BACK IN ONE COLOR 

It seems like there are 2 options.

1. A kind of receiver with a HDMI input, which is not useful for me because I only got my PS4 connected through HDMI and we watch all movies through the Smart TV's  Netflix/Amazon/YouTube. It's called dream screen (company closed BTW) 

2. There is a App for Smart TV's which is able to send the necessary info, but Sony TV's don't seem to support that App.

Is there really no other way to do DIY ambient Lighting for Sony Smart TV's?

I live in germany and my budget is about 150€. I should be able to mold and setup a raspberry with instructions.

Bonus Note: Is there a delay in the Video signal if I would use my PS4 for gaming?

Watching Netflix/Amazon/YouTube through the PS4 is not an option because my PS4 is a freakin airplane.

Just to be sure, i don't just want colors on the back of my TV. I want LED which respond to the picture shown in TV in somewhat real-time.

It’s bad on the sides as well, though that’s been somewhat mitigated by curtains whereas they don’t reach or cover the top of the window. 

So far I’ve tried weather seal adhesive foam strips and some D-shaped self-adhesive strips that I stuffed inside the gap. Marginal decrease at best, so I took it down.

Is there maybe some kind of tape that would help cover it? I need something that would 100% block the light. I can’t be stuffing towels or anything like that up there anymore, or else I would. Sadly it has to be kept presentable.

can oil or water bublers be used? particles not caught by a hepa filter are small, and im not sure how they interact with liquid filtering systems.

activated charcoal? pretty much how CBRN canisters work is a hepa filter and a tuna can sized chunk of carbon, would this help with nano particles?

intuitively a combination of a hepa filter element and a liquid bubler would provide pretty good protection. the name of the game is slowing, not prevention.",18,1583946555,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fh0jjr/possibility_of_developing_a_diyable_particulate/,DIY,1

fgxsnd,MattJC7,Washing machine requires cleaning?,"Hi all. 

I recently moved into a new property and the washing machine looked fairly new. 

However, after a few washes it was leaving clothes with a mildewy, repulsive and almost metallic smell. 

I did a 90°C service wash with white vinegar, then detergent. This fixed the smell for maybe a few washes. The smell then returned so I did another service wash and checked the detergent drawer which was clean. 

I did a recent wash which did not leave the clothes smelling, but I needed to add an extra spin after finishing as they were quite damp. After this spin, the clothes smelled very strongly. 

I then opened the “self-cleaning pump” and found this: [Pump and seal picture](https://imgur.com/a/mBSgjVa). Clearly coated with a gritty, grey substance that smelled pungently of the smell described. 

I had to resort to scraping this material away as it was so bedded in. However, there is an inlet to the left which is small and I was unable to reach. I used a bendy wire straw cleaner and pulled out an astounding amount of this grey, wet material. 

There don’t seem to be any leaks. There does seem to be mould underneath the machine however. 

The landlord is probably going to be resistant to sending someone out, so I wanted to put this out to Reddit for a more expert opinion as I certainly am an amateur. 

Is this limescale? Is it an inlet or outlet water pump? How do you fully clean this, including around the bend?

fgw46k,-Rubaduck-,Ceiling mounted “crane” bed,"Im looking for sparring/advice on how to go about mounting a bed to the ceiling with the possibility of lowering it at night and raising it at day. Maybe it’s impossible - but I wanted to run it by you guys before I pass the final judgement. 

The current plan is to mount a manual winch on the wall and have the wire go through a nook, screwed into a supporting beam in the ceiling.

I’m not sure how to attach the wire to the bed frame - I suppose I would need to add four wires (or something of the like) that would connect to each of the four corners. But then that means I can’t raise the bed beyond the point where the wire “splits” into four (since the four wires most likely aren’t able to go through the nook). I would very much like to have the bed raised as close to the ceiling as possible - so any ideas are most welcome! 

Hope you can either make or break the idea!?",2,1583928532,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fgw46k/ceiling_mounted_crane_bed/,DIY,1

fgv4kd,geneticsmart,Low Low Power esp equivalent of Bluetooh Chip suggestion,"Hello Awesome Folks,

I am planning to build a DIY smart lock that runs on batteries to operate a small motor 

Now what i need is also suggestions on esp equivalent of a bluetooth chip that i can use for my project. My requirements are below

* Low power as i am planning to run the smart lock or 4 AA batteries and expect it to atleast run for few months
* Easy to program. Preferrable where you do not need any additional programmers, more like wemos d1 mini where you can plug in USB and straigh away upload the code
* Cheap dont want to spend a lot of money on bluetooth chip
* Small in the size of esp or wemos so it can fit into the 3d printed module
* Inbuilt microcontroller. I like to build stuff thats fast so do not want to connect it with another microcontroller to send instructions

I understand we have ESP32 but from all the research i did, its not power efficient to run on batteries.

fguox6,david47s,Which tool to get?,"Hi,

I recently purchased a Makita 18v impact driver with adjustable speed and all.
I want to get another tool for drilling and I'm undecided whether I should get a hammer drill or mini sds.
I need a drill but not frequently so it's hard to decide, I don't drill specific things which is also a problem, I will sometimes drill wood, sometimes thin metal and sometimes concrete.
I know that a lot of people suggest that if you are drilling mixed materials you should get a hammer drill, but I also have the adjustment speed impact driver which I can use to also drill wood and metal.
My biggest fear is concrete with rebar... I know that the mini sds with good bit will manage that, and I know hammer drills can do concrete, however I used to have a hammer drill a couple years ago and it drilled concrete fine but as soon as I hit rebar it was just stuck in place and burning up with 0 progress... I am wondering if it is still the case with modern ones.
I am not making holes larger that 8mm but I do need something that will drill anything I could have in my house and unfortunately it includes concrete with rebar...

So I'm asking you guys, which tool should I get?",7,1583920536,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fguox6/which_tool_to_get/,DIY,1

I own a table saw and a miter chop saw, but I use them to frame houses; never done anything like this. I knew about jointed woodwork, but I don’t know how it’s done, and I don’t have the typical tools used to create them. I’ve always wanted to do something like this, so I used my table saw to cut the grooves and I ran the pieces again on both sides to shave material off and make my joint. I sanded it with an orbital sander to baby smooth touch.

I will let him stain and finish it because he really likes working on wood projects like this. I can’t wait to see what he does with it. I made it mostly to hold some goodies and a gift card to his favorite store haha. 

It was a 24 inch by 5-1/2 inch walnut board from Home Depot. Was originally trying to make a lid for it too, but wasted too much material trying to make my grooves and joints.

I'd like to redo it because 1, there are some low spots here and there that I would like to level and 2, my living room and my dining room have 2 different type of flooring currently because the dining room is 1/4 inch higher. 

I'd like to install 1/4 inch plywood in my living room to make it even with the dining room and have the same floor everywhere. One thing i've noticed with my floor is that it is pretty cold and really loud for the basement (i have a bedroom right under the living room in my basement). I was thinking of installing underlayment (1.5mm) on top of the plywood to help with that but after doing some research, it seems having underlayment under LVP isn't recommended unless the LVP thickness is &gt; 5mm (could mess with the interlocking system). 

Has anyone done that? What are my options here? Would just installing 1/4inch plywood help with temperature/noise at all? Is there a different kind of underlayment for thin vinyl planks?

Black wire was just tucked into the j box; from my reading I believe that is the always-on hot. I just really wanted some confirmation on that. Also, if I'm not using it should i put a cap on it before pushing it back into the j box?  Thanks for the help

What are my options other than tearing into the slab and moving all the plumbing? The wall with the pipes is an outside wall, it freezes in winter where I live.

I thought maybe I could do a false wall and shower over that? or maybe there is a floating shower pan dealio so the drain doesn't have to be moved?

Some areas are sort of peeling and I can see the particle board a little bit, so Im assuming, from what I researched a little, that I would need to fill those areas and then sand them down and follow directions as to any cabinet painting?

fg2zo4,lostinsynonyms,painting veneer particle boards,"Long story short: to save some money I got this mobile home that my family got as a payment from a service they did years ago and decided to place it in a beautiful land they have, so I don't have to pay rent or commit to buy a house here, since I don't plan to stay in this city for longer than 2/3 years.

Anyway, the kitchen cabinets are made of veneer particle boards. I really don't like the appearance of it and I don't want to be making any big Renos, I already spent too much on decor and other things that were not in my plans, so I was thinking that just painting them would be an ""easier"" solution. The cabinets seem to be peeling in some areas and I can even see the particle board a little bit here and there, plus I don’t like the fake wood look. I had to research a lot to find out that they were veneer particle boards and I’ve seen a couple of videos, but very hard to find good ones for this material and circumstances. 

**I’m here to ask for advice on which products I should be using, like best brand for products, best paint, Im assuming I might need some sort of filling like epoxy, idk... any help is very much appreciated. And if you guys think it could look terrible and might not be worth the try, since I don't have much experience with DIYs,  I could just hold off.**

I will be so grateful for the feedback. Let me know what the experts need to know in terms of my skills in working with tools (if that plays a major rule or not) or anything else.

I want to make a cover for it. Something that will completely cover it but not damage it in any way. Needs to be removable. 

I’m considering making an entire countertop out of wood and a cheap tile or maybe something else creative. However, the counter has a bit of a raised tile lip at the edge. So just laying a piece of wood on top won’t work because the front is higher than the back, plus the tile wraps around the edge. So my DIY cover will need to hang over and down a little.

ffqliw,JasonDare64,Peg board help,"I recently got into the idea of using a peg board for climbing training. I have the general concept ready to go, I’m planning to mount it to a tree outside, I plan to do a square pattern with 1 row of holes on the top and bottom and 3 columns on the ends in a pattern of 1 row with 2 holes then 1 row with 1 hole and continuing for 11 rows. I need some help deciding what kind of wood to use for the peg holes. I have an idea I’m trying to follow, a friend I visited had one like this it was mounted to a tree that fell down and he put back in the ground. It had the boards with the holes mounted to a big sheet of plywood and some 2 by 4s were cut into the tree then had the plywood drilled into the 2 by 4s. I plan to do similar but I still need to figure how big a piece of wood to use to make the peg holes, I also need to find the measurements for where to put the holes and where I can get some pegs. My friend had some metal pegs he wrapped leather straps around, but other guides I’ve seen have just used dowels. This was a long winded question but what I’m really after is getting measurements for holes, thickness of wood for peg holes, and pegs.

ffnbbh,nichetrashaccount,Help Me Understand Constant Current Drivers (LED),"I've Google'd quite a few articles and visited different forums with no luck.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1.) Constant current drivers can work throughout the lower 80% of their stated range. As long as the LEDs voltage requirement is within that lower 80% range, you're good as far as *voltage* is concerned.  
&gt;  
&gt;2.) It doesn't matter how many LEDs are connected - the driver will adjust the *voltage* to suit the needs of the LEDs (assuming they're all the same type of LED). eg. You can connect one, two or three 3v/300mA LEDs (in parallel) to a 3-12v/300mA constant current driver and they'll work.

Correct? I'm just trying to ensure I have a proper understanding of a constant current driver.

\---

What I'm trying to do is rewire two sets of battery-powered string lights. **They're all white and there are 21 SMD LEDs per string. They take (3) AA batteries/string, so I'm assuming they run at 4.5v/150mA each or 9v/300mA in parallel.**

Ideally I'll use a separate driver for each. Would I then need to add a resistor to drop down the current to 150mA? (Does this result in wasting approximately half the wattage being supplied?) Where would this leave my driver if it has a variable voltage range? Will it adjust?

Or. Most constant current LED drivers I see are labeled for 300mA.  Would I be better off using the same driver for both strings? 300mA divides easily into the required 150mA/string. Then all I need is a driver range that covers 9v?

I apologize for so many questions - I'm entirely new to this and I'm so confused by how a constant current driver works.",7,1583719148,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ffnbbh/help_me_understand_constant_current_drivers_led/,DIY,1

Some background: I'm working on an electrical project, and the cans are going to be used as kind of grips for this device. I've removed the tops and bottoms of the cans. Now I'd like to remove the branding. Unlike some other brands, Barbasol prints their logo on the steel can itself. Frustratingly, Barbasol is the only brand that makes cans in the size I need.

I've tried sanding, but it's laborious and doesn't really get into the dimples of the can. (The can dimples near the top, where the cylinder gets pulled into a circle of smaller diameter.)

ffhjly,irunwithknivesouch,Help with wiring question. Please.,"I took down a ceiling fan and was distracted and failed to really look at how it was connected. Now I can't figure out how to reconect a new ceiling fan.

This is in a kitchen. The breaker controls a ceiling fan with switch, over the sink light with a switch and task lighting with a switch.

After removing the fan, the box in the ceiling has three sets of cables feeding into it, each with a black, white and ground. One set has a hot black wire. With the other two, the black is not hot. I can make a connection with a tester from the one hot black wire with each of the white wires and each of the black wires. 
When I try these connections with different switches turned off, it doesn't seem to make any difference. The other two black wires are still not hot and I can still make a connection with the one hot black wire and all of the other wires. 


I can't make sense of this. 


I tried connecting all the whites together and all the blacks together. All the wall switches were off. The ceiling fan worked. The sink and task lights did not work. And when I flipped the switch to the ceiling fan, which already had power, it tripped the breaker.

I am at a loss. Does this make sense to anyone?",10,1583695466,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ffhjly/help_with_wiring_question_please/,DIY,1

ffb159,pockkler,How heavy would a side table be if it was made from empty bottles and epoxy?,"Hi everyone

I've had an idea for a side table, based on the bottle crates you can see in the photo. I wondered if it would be possible to lay the bottles on their side and then fill them and the spaces in between with epoxy, so that the side table would be pretty solid. 

My main concern with this idea is how heavy the bottles and epoxy would be, and whether a wooden or metal frame would support this. 

Does anyone have any experience of building something like this?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!

ffav42,wheresmyhat8,Fitting a kitchen door into a flat frame,"Hi r/diy! Myself and my girlfriend are recent home buyers in the UK and as such four DIY experience is somewhat limited to what a landlord would allow. We'd like to hang a door between the kitchen to the hallway/stairs in our 1960s-built house.:

[https://i.imgur.com/SkrmiDa.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/SkrmiDa.jpg)

There is already a frame in place, but I'm not convinced that it's built to actually hold a door.  My concern is that the other frames in the house have a ridge to stop the door going beyond the closure point, but this frame is just flat. The wall is a breeze block wall, so should be strong enough to support a door, but I'm not sure I'm brave enough to dismantle the frame to replace it.

My research tells me I might have to fit a fire door here? I didn't have one on the kitchen of my rental flat, but knowing landlords, that doesn't mean it's not a building regulation...

Is it likely to be possible to simply buy a suitable door that fits the gap, route out a slot for the latch and hang it there? Is there anything I should be aware of before trying?

I was also wondering if there were any UK building regs that might bite us? The only one I can see is the necessity for a fire door.

ff9slg,mrqwest,Lumpy plaster and the state of my walls,"We moved in to our new house a year ago and we’re slowly moving through it and making it nice. It’s a 1930s Semi in the UK.

Our lounge used to have a picture rail which some previous owners removed and have then lined over with lining paper. It’s fine during the day but in the evening when our lamps are on, you can see the lumpy repairs behind.

Additionally the lounge has an opening between reception rooms which looks like there’s been a bit of movement over the years. The plaster has blown and again, looks as if it’s been hidden behind the lining paper which looks awful in the evenings.

What’s the best way to approach either of these issues.

The lining paper job is awful all round anyway (wall junctions aren’t straight or 90degrees) so is the best bet to remove the lining paper and skim all walls?

What is lining paper for anyway (never understood it)?

ff5unw,SargentSchultz,How to fill in the missing tile?,"Hello, looking for help on filling in the missing circle of tile left over from an old lowboy water heater that we relocated.  There is a hinged door that will mount on the left to close off the area and we'd like to install wire shelving for small appliances. So most of the time this area won't be seen unless you are getting something.

Intent is to replace the back wallboard and finish the three walls.  Question is how to handle the missing tile on the floor?  It's 3/8"" deep and 24"" round. We don't have the same tile and would rather not risk cutting the existing tile flat for fear of cracking the other tile.  Unless this is easy/safe to do? We do not have extra tile.

Ideas we've thought of

* raised piece of matching wood about 1"" off the ground supported by 1x1
* Fill the hole with thin set and then lay down new tile over it.  Kinda hinky, but it would be covered. Something better than thin set to fill that hole?
* Risk cutting the tile out and put different tile in there

 Ideas would be appreciated and thank you in advance.

i think most places i can find say just run 2"" pipes and you'll be fine, but due to the location of my furnace, i think the run is 30 feet with at least two 90's inside. plus whatever creativity needs to be done outside because it would exit the house 2' below a window.

if my furnace was 110,000 btu in 1979, do i replace it with 110,000 btu now as well? or do i use the bonnet cap of 88,000 btu? i cannot figure out the efficiency of this furnace, but if we assumed 60%, would i replace it with a 70,000 btu furnace? then i find calculators online that say zone 5 is 50-60 btu/sq foot where 1,800 sqft would put me at 90,000-108,0000 btu.

I have 3 windows at the end of my bedroom that are all the same height (quite tall) but the middle window is considerably wider than the two angled windows flanking it. There isn’t a ton of room between each window, so I’m hoping that most of what I have to mount the rod into has studs behind it. 

So much of what I see online says things like 4-6+ inches from each frame side and the same or more above the window. I’m not doing this to be fancy, I’m doing it (with the U-shaped return rods) to block out as much light as I possibly can with what I have to work with (I sleep during days).

I also keep seeing that each panel should be the width of the window, though I’m not sure why. The two-packs of panels that I bought basically combined just cover the width of the window plus a little extra on each side. I guess I don’t fully “get it”. They didn’t come in any wider panels or I would have bought those.

I’ll take all of the advice I can get but my primary concern right now is where I should actually mount the rods. I’m pretty confused. My room has really tall ceilings, if that makes any difference.

ff2pwh,beng1244,"Water damaged ceiling, safe to remove myself??","Hey all, so I've had what a assume is a slow leak in my basement bathroom ceiling right above the sink, and a small hole/water damaged weak area about 4-5 inches across has formed. I've covered it with some tape while figuring out what to do about it, but I'm wondering if I can safely remove it myself, or I should be worried about potentially releasing a ton of mold when removing it. I'll have to get a plumber in to fix whatever pipe is causing it, but it's starting to smell a bit now I think so I was hoping to remove it to see what's going on up there. I think it's the upstairs bathroom that's above it, although I'm just the basement tenant so I'm not 100% certain. This has been like this for quite a while (like a couple months) and isn't getting worse super quickly, but it obviously need to be dealt with.

ff2f8i,thelastzionist,Phase one of my outdoor dreamscape!!,"https://imgur.com/gallery/tHns5ZV

^ ^ ^ ^ ^. Pictures.


So I started an outdoor project at my house to allow my fiance and i do to some redecorating as far as the outside accent lighting is concerned, as the old way didn’t work at all. You can see it in some of the pictures how the old string light was droopy and hung down and looked pretty terrible. Then one day I remembered I’m an electrician, and decided to go completely insane and over-do it and make it wonderful. So, I know the pictures are out of order so I’ll list what i did in order and you can make sense of it from there.

1. Bought One Inch Rigid Conduit and the one hole straps and back straps and painted them black with some rust preventative paint.

2. Mounted them to four different locations, two on the deck on each far corner, and two on the house itself.

3. Mounted Five Porcelain wire holders for 100 AMP services to the house.

4. Bought a guide wire kit off amazon and bought misc. hardware from Home Depot.

5. Mounted the guide wire kit to the pipes.

That takes care re-hanging the new lighting we’re going to buy. Now for the extra mile.

I put in a new GFCI 20Amp single pole breaker in my panel, and to the outside of the house in a weather proof two gang box at the bottom of the house, i ran a conduit up to the top of the house and put another two gang weather proof box in. In the middle, i put in a T, and then an LB to the side of a three gang weatherproof box. I installed a total of 4 20AMP duplex outlets, at the top and bottom of the house, and i put in 3 switches at the three gang box. But here’s the kicker. I broke the tabs off on the outlets and ran a separate switch leg to each individual receptacle, and put in 2 3- single pole switches and one 2- single pole switch. Giving me a total of 8 switches, one for each individual receptacle. With this all in place, my fiance is now able to get as intricate as she likes with the outside lighting, and be able to control it all at will to any combination her heart desires. 

I’m so excited to see her get into the project and start picking out lighting. 

Phase two is me building the “outdoor living room.” I’m setting up a 7.1 Receiver outside with a 200” projector screen. Going HAM on that. Post about it as soon as its done.",3,1583618798,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/ff2f8i/phase_one_of_my_outdoor_dreamscape/,DIY,1

The mount instructions say you can screw directly into the studs or you can use the included concrete anchors if you’re drilling into concrete.

What would be the best way to do this? Should we drill into the stud, which will also end up screwing a little bit into the concrete behind the stud?

fex636,Gr80x,Why did my floor fan stop working? (read symptoms),"First it started screeching

Then it stopped working...but intermittently. Meaning, if you turned it off and turned it on sometime later, it wouldn't turn on right away but leave it switched on and eventually it'll start working. And then stop again sometime later.

The screeching was intermittent as well. Turning the head at certain angles or turning up the speed made it go away, but still, it wasn't consistent...like, there was no specific position where it wouldn't screech.

Manually spinning the blades ""sometimes"" helped in getting it to work.

When it stopped spinning and you place your hand on the motor/head, it'd be hot (no idea if that was also the case when working normally and this normal). 

One time when it stopped working I could smell the distinct burning electric smell. But the next day and for several other days, it was working, albeit not normally...like described above. 

Finally now it seems like the blades siezed and they are not spinning even when you manually try to spin them.

It all situations (even now that it has siezed) the motor seems to be working when you turn it on because you can feel it if you place your hand in the motor case.

fer7ct,bittersweetnez,“L” Door for Shed,"My boyfriend and I are planning on building a shed that will be for storage as well as doubling as an outdoor socializing area.

We would like to have the right door operate as a normal door, but have the left hand door hinge and swing out from partway back on the left hand wall. This means the front section of the left wall will technically be part of the door, while still maintaining the 90 degree of the left wall/front side corner. This means the door will have a “L” shape. (Long side of “L” is the door; short side is left wall section.)


Now for my questions:

**1. What the hell is this type of door called???**
We have both tried every version of every keyword we can think of and can not find any plans or even a name for this style of door. 


**2. If you have any experience with this type of door, how does this effect the framing of the shed?** ie: load bearing

I've checked both and they're just labeled as ' G P Clear Epoxy' or 'GP Epoxy Clear Adhesive'. They both say they're good for outdoors, except one is supposedly more durable. - are there any specific ingredients or anything to look for in this stuff?

As for the dyes, i'd like to dye the epoxy as well as some cement. I've found a few dyes i can ship to myself for epoxy, but none that can ship here for the cement. Are there any dyes i can make myself for the epoxy or cement?

I've looked at that online, but they seem a bit vague, like 'use water based paint for the cement'. is that any good? How good is it compared to a proper dye, etc?",3,1583527904,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fejztn/what_to_look_for_in_epoxy_dyes_and_cement/,DIY,1

feiz4c,yogurta33,Can you construct your own AC unit?,"Moved into a unit that has a busted AC. It is a metal travel trailer. High humidity and temperature in the 100s Fahrenheit summertime. I would tough it out but my due date is next month and I know I cannot put an infant through this. Not only is it dangerous I think it might be child neglect. The only advice I can find online is to put wet towels on baby and having done that to myself before I know too well how ineffective that is. The landlord will not let us install window AC unit. I read up on humidifiers, ice box fan coolers, and portable AC units, seems like they are useless unless you pay $800 for the industrial grade stuff. I don't have $800.

fehy75,lnneidig,Instant Parts When You Need Them The Most,"Hello,

Have you been struggling to find the designs, models and footprints you need?

I was struggling with the same problem. I needed parts and I needed them quickly. I did not have any time to spare as the deadline was quickly approaching.

I searched the web and came across a website called [SnapEDA.com](https://www.snapeda.com/?utm_source=eval)

I was skeptical at first but they said they had millions of designs. Maybe they would have the ones I need?

I signed up and was pleasantly surprised. Not only did they have designs - they had the correct ones!

Since then I have used this site countless times for a wide range of parts and haven't had a single error.

This has become a must have tool especially for manufacturers, engineers and companies who rely on building parts rapidly.

And when they don't have the footprint you need - simply reach out and they will do everything in their power to get to you within 24hours. They are that quick!

If you need instant parts without errors, then try out SnapEDA. It helped me and I am sure it will help many of you.",1,1583519983,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fehy75/instant_parts_when_you_need_them_the_most/,DIY,1

fe3bv7,skratchx,"Need advice for covering a 54""x42"" piece of plywood in billiard cloth","I've had this idea for a while to cover a piece of plywood with felt to act as a topper for my coffee table to have a larger space for boardgames. I finally called around some billiard shops and found a place that sold billiard cloth remnants. Ended up pulling the trigger and now I have a $75 piece of gray billiard cloth (wool with teflon coating). I can double check the thickness of my plywood board, but the lateral dimensions are 54x42. Maybe 1/2"" or 3/4"" thick (shouldn't matter for this request too much, I think). I have to check the cloth dimensions again but it's a good bit larger than the plywood. At least 60""x60"".  

I tried looking around on youtube for how-to's on covering large surfaces with felt. All the videos I found were either tiny surfaces or pool tables. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgKw7KFv12M&amp;) is actually pretty intriguing, and I'm wondering if I can employ a similar but simplified strategy of just gluing the edges and underside, stretching the cloth over the top of the board. I had initially assumed that I would be gluing the top surface. I already purchased contact cement and plan to pick up a nap roller.  

I'd like to avoid screwing this up as much as possible, since I've got a very nice piece of cloth. My questions are as follows:  

* Should I use glue only, or staple the underside?
* Should I glue over the top surface or just stretch the cloth over the top surface?
* Open to any advice on how to cut the corners to have the cloth fold neatly under the plywood, covering the actual edge of the corner
* Any pitfalls to watch out for, or tips/tricks",16,1583447136,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fe3bv7/need_advice_for_covering_a_54x42_piece_of_plywood/,DIY,1

Pictures included.,"I'm taking the pics from the home listing. Basically, I'm buying a home a little end of my price range and I'm intending on living in the home for a while but down the line replacing some things in the house. The kitchen is by far what I think will be most expensive to change. The layout is kind of weird and the dishwasher is out in an odd place. If down the the line I want to update the cabinets (I'm open to refurbishing them), put new appliances in (nothing fancy just something more updated), making the whole kitchen hardware floor, get rid of the weird mid-kitchen island and put the dishwasher in a normal place and basically expanding the kitchen to that dining area and open it up, what's a realistic budget? I'm not particularly handy but I'm willing to learn and put work into myself. I'm also willing to wait for sales/etc for good buys.

fdwvb2,millionsarescreaming,I cannot find an answer for this weird situation - concrete countertops pressed to look like brick and mortar - how do I epoxy over this mess?,"Hi all, first-time poster long time follower. I just bought a house and it has countertops made of concrete pressed to look like a brick wall complete with deep trenches for the ""mortar."" (yes, it is as stupid as it sounds. good luck cleaning up spills) I really want to level the countertop and epoxy the whole thing for a quick cheap fix. Would epoxy fill those mortar trenches or should I fill those with a concrete filler before covering in epoxy? 

Thanks

I don't really want to replace them atm as that would mean demolishing the entire kitchen (stupid concrete countertops) and I've got a baby so not a lot of time or money.",18,1583422271,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fdwvb2/i_cannot_find_an_answer_for_this_weird_situation/,DIY,1

Some of the things i want to fix up and consider working on requires some functionality a lather provides, but i frankly dont need a full lathe, i am not fabricating, mostly cleaning up. 
  
I am looking to build a small Lathe but only the half with the motor and the chuck. i have all the hows for mounting, wiring, speed control, safety figured out just fine. What i am unsure of is what type of motor i should get. I am trying to figure out what specs i need. So say i have a motor with a chuck, I toss a bolt or rod into the chuck and it starts spinning. i use a file and some sand paper to clean up the part and start polishing it. i need something strong enough that me filing or sanding wont bog down the motor. but also not so fast and strong that it becomes a saftey issue.

fdsurw,Zeo5,"Sit-stand desk frame needs a table top, Ikea Linnmon or something else?","I bought a [Jarvis standing desk frame](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/desk-frames/jarvis-frame-only.html) and I'm planning to put an ikea table top on it.

Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qdQV1fB6nI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qdQV1fB6nI)

I've seen the Linnmon being a common option for this desk, but none of the videos/blogs I see talking about it say anything about considerations for drilling the needed holes in the table top.

The desk frame uses screws on the border (for the legs and for the control panel) and on the inside ([assembly manual if that helps](https://www.fully.com/media/media/PDFs/fully-jarvis-wide-standing-desk-assembly-instructions_v2.pdf)). The linnmon is just [wood on the borders and cardboard honeycomb on the inside](https://www.ikeahackers.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/honeycomb.jpg), so while I can understand the outermost holes, I don't quite see how you drill the innermost holes (or rather how do you screw something there since it would just be hollow cardboard).

I like the linnmon since its the cheapest and I also want to add grommets and it would be easier to drill them using a hole saw, but I'm open to any other ikea top that also lets me drill some grommet holes.

So, am I missing something here with the Linnmon and drilling the holes is straigtforward? Or would I be better served with some other tabletop? Thanks!",2,1583400730,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fdsurw/sitstand_desk_frame_needs_a_table_top_ikea/,DIY,1

1. They screw into to a drop ear connection behind your finished wall. How the hell do you know if it is leaking? You can't really test them until you put in your tile/drywall. If the shower arm breaks (i.e.: because someone pulls on it) you probably have to tear out part of your wall.

2. They have nothing to grip to tightly screw them in, and if you use pliers you'll just damage it.

3. There is only one position that is correct. So you twist until it is tight as possible... then twist some more until it is aligned? All with nothing to grip. At least in cars, you get a torque wrench to match the manufacturer specification.",26,1583381300,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fdplv1/shower_arms_everything_i_hate_about_plumbing_in/,DIY,1

fdlm67,nosnowblows,Help wiring electrical box,"Hi guys,

I'm repairing a cabin built in the 70's.

I'm working on fixing a small circuit which had previously been wired in series and failed because of that. I rewired the 4 outlet box at the end in parallel but it still wouldn't work so I checked out this one downstream. It was a hot mess of a million wires, electrical tape and loose connections. I'm just a little confused about how to go about rewiring it correctly. I have two new outlet sets for 4 outlets total. 

There are a grand total of 9 wires sticking out of this box!!! Four are white, black, pink and copper coming from the circuit breaker and there are four of the same going to the next outlets down the line that I just fixed. The last wire is a copper ground wire connected to the metal box. 

Here is a picture if it works https://imgur.com/a/BKU8tHn

The pink wires were unused and I'm pretty sure are just extras for a potential switch that was never installed or the electrician got lazy idk. So now I'm left with three wires from the breaker box and three wires to the next box down the line, and that damned copper ground coming from the box. 

It's been a while since my electrical classes and I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing.  Is this right? This is my wiring diagram

I was thinking of trying to re-mount it with some sort of vibration isolation - maybe an adhesive foam pad or something - but wondered if anyone else had some insight.

Can I just put the insulation directly against these holes (I’m guessing not) If I can’t, what do I need to do to keep rain/moisture from soaking into the insulation behind the dry wall?

Discovered this morning that a gasket/seal in my bathroom sink supply line had gone bad.  Whenever the line was moved water would spray out from below the FIP connection nut. I ran out to Ace and picked up a replacement line but just can't get the damn thing to screw on.

Both are 1/2"" FIP to faucet and 3/8"" to valve.  When I try to put the old back on, I can feel it get seated and a couple twists makes the connection. With the new one I don't get the same seated feeling and can not get the threads to bite.  It fells like its just a hair too small.

Am I missing an indicator on the line labels that would account for the interior dimensions of the FIP connection?  Is there a ""trick"" to help get the threads to connect? Or, should I just go chug a fifth and keep trying?

I'm almost at the point where I want to put the old one back on and throw some teflon tape on, surround it with a baseball sized amount of plumbers putty, and spray the whole thing with Flex Seal.",15,1583339204,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fdfgly/plumbing_where_a_simple_fix_leads_to_a_mental/,DIY,1

I went to snake a drain last weekend, and in the process replaced an old tub drain that needed attention. It was tight quarters, though, and I was not gentle - there may have been a hammer involved.

Anyway, the new drain is great, and the connections above the floor are solid. I now have a leak underneath the floor, though, in roughly the same spot where the old drain setup had leaked previously (I could see that old leak above the floor, so I know it was an issue).

So, I made a hole in the ceiling below, and found this monstrosity. It's beyond my abilities, so I'm going to call a plumber, but what the heck am I looking at here? I can see the pipe where the new drain feeds, but then there's this big reservoir-looking thing. The top of that is what's leaking when the tub drains, and it's a pretty fast leak.

You would pair a flip down visor, like [this](https://www.harborfreight.com/face-shield-with-flip-up-visor-62995.html?cid=paid_google|||62995&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyZGAy4WA6AIViIrICh2AegG1EAQYASABEgL5EvD_BwE) one with a full body paint suit like [this](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/white-disposable-microporous-coveralls-with-hood-xxxl/488MP4003XL.html?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GoogleShopping&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI89CA64WA6AIVjICfCh082wYUEAQYASABEgIzlfD_BwE). 

You’d put on protective latex gloves as well, and frequently disinfect the visor as well as routinely switch out the gloves and paint suit. 

I know this isn’t really the usual kind of DIY post, but as it spreads further and further, there seems to be no real solution proposed for truly staying safe short of a multi thousand dollar hazmat suit. I think that this “poor mans’s suit” might be able to prevent contamination, as well as be incredibly cheap and cost effective.

After cutting and sanding the boards, I brushed on a coat of black tea to bring out the tannins and create a deeper texture and darker stain. I let them sit overnight and sanded them with 120 grit paper the next day, since the tea raises the grain. 

I stained them with Valspar Espresso. Just one coat, applied with a soft cloth. The next day I applied two coats of finishing wax before mounting. I used some basic black shelf brackets and left a 1.5” gap from the wall to create a bit more depth.

I'm new at this but am an experienced bike mechanic. Only looking for something to cross town with; would prefer a slim lightweight 1 wheel trailer but a 2 wheel trailer, if it's significantly easier to build, would also be doable.

I have Googled for this but I'm wondering about what my options are in general, if any more experienced builders can definitively point to one or another answer and say, ""Yep, that one is by far the most efficient.""

My design options from memory are pretty much limited to constructed something that looks like a Burley trailer frame (with floorboards and walls, probably wood or maybe aluminum), 2 wheels, that can attach somewhere up the length of one of the rear dropouts. Potentially both dropouts. But idk about where it would need to flex in order to turn safely, etc.

Price range is 20-50, but I already have oodles of bicycle components and frames, and recently harvested a bunch of bamboo poles that could be fit into something for this.

fd2g5w,poland_bound,Is special silicone needed to seal a metal drain in a shower with natural stone tiles?,"Replacing the silicone seal along my shower drain and want to make sure I don't mess something up. A couple things I'm concerned about:

1) Do I need a special silicone for natural stone? I've seen some writings online about silicone leeching / staining natural stone, but I can't find anything definitive. My local hardware store (in The Netherlands) recommended a standard silicone for bathrooms and I'm worried it might stain the stone (product pic below).  If I *do* need something special, a recommendation would be very much appreciated. Even more appreciated if it's available on amazon.de. 

2) It's been a nightmare trying to get all the silicone off the natural stone edges. I have 99% of it off but there are still some tiny specks here and there hiding in the roughness of the edge. How good is good enough when it comes to prep for new silicone?

I replaced the valve with a silent on on the other sump pump. Its now quiet most of the time except a few times a day the loud thump still occurs. Its definitely happening between 10:05 and 10:30pm everynight. Im assuming this thump is from the 2ns sump pump/pit that appears to not have a check valve. Any help?

fcxnn6,GoBackToLeddit,How to create window/door barricades that are easy to assemble/disassemble?,"I plan on being away from home for a few extended periods of time this spring and summer, so I want to barricade my windows and doors from the inside. For my windows, I envision hanging sheets of 1/2"" plywood over each. I would install three 3/8"" threaded inserts on each side of the windows. I would then drill slightly larger holes into the plywood corresponding to the locations of the inserts so that I could fasten the plywood to the inserts using 3/8"" washers and nuts. Doing it this way would allow me to easily disassemble the barricade while keeping the wall flat with no protruding studs. The inserts would allow me to reuse the assembly over and over as opposed to just repeatedly driving nuts into the 2x4's which could eventually compromise the threading in the wood. I think this would work really well, but I can't find threaded inserts 2 1/2"" long.

The other option would be to install threaded studs/rods into the frame around the windows in the same configuration as the inserts and instead use a nut and washer to fasten the plywood. This would work, but now I have studs protruding from the walls which I don't want.

So I think I painted a good picture of what I am ultimately wanting to do. Can anyone else come up with a more creative/effective approach to achieve the same goal through a different approach? Or, if my idea is sound, where can I get long threaded inserts?",12,1583255070,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fcxnn6/how_to_create_windowdoor_barricades_that_are_easy/,DIY,1

fcvxog,pete_of_pistols,First go at landscaping: The Path Project!,"I've been meaning to take this ragged path up from the front of our house for ages.

Based in Sydney, it went from rock hard earth and drought/dusty conditions to flooding in the space of a week and I figured now was the time to do it.

Having never taken on a job like this before, I had my brother-in-law come over to help, and pinched some leftover bricks from a path project of his own. They were from an old retaining wall and had a mix of mortar and clay stuck to them, so I went about cleaning them all by hand. About 80% of the bricks in the original path were used again, with those missing out being the few who didn't match the other or were broken beyond salvage.

Old bricks came up easy with a crowbar and, lo and behold, there was no base underneath them, causing the shift and cracking issues we were facing with the old path.
Pulled up about a tonne of soil to make room for a proper base, and went with 1.5 tonnes of recycled road base. That was spread, loosely leveled it, then taken to with a hired plate compactor and sprayed with water to lock it in.

Then came the half tonne of river sand, screeding, and laying the brick pavers. 
Had a swing with a huge angle grinder and brick cutting diamond disc to set the edges to meet with the base of each of the stairs, and it was scary/rewarding.

Back breaking work, but we'll worth it in the end.

Thanks for having a gander,

Cheers!

I have an idea: there is a problem with coronavirus that it can DDoS/spam medical system. By fresh [China stat](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fbt49e/the_who_sent_25_international_experts_to_china/), about 15% of infected people require oxygen supply or even  [artificial respiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_ventilation) 

It means that death rate without this devices can be much more current 2% - up to 15%. There is a problem that medical system don't have enough devices to save lifes if we'll have millions of infected peoples. What I suggest - to create a DIY project for 3d printed devices for arficial respiration and/or oxygen supply, using cheap and wide-spreded devices (lile devices from Ikea, etc). 

For this project we need 3d makers, device testers, and maybe programmers(for arduino controller/raspberry pi). Guys, we can save millions of lifes if we create this project.

1) I see builds using a ""floating floor"" on deck blocks, that end up using hurricane ties on the roof, but then I go back to see they don't ever actually connect the the floor/building tot he blocks in anyway.  I feel like I'm missing something here, shouldn't the building be anchored to the ground in some way?

2) If I was to pour a slab, I've seen people put down moisture barrier under the walls. In my case, on a slab I'd need to build a floor too. Should the floor get a moisture barrier too, or is that more just an exterior wall thing.

fcnasg,mangeek,Want to 'solar boost' hot water,"So I'm aware of systems to 'pre heat' inlet water in a storage tank, but I was hoping to do something a little more direct.

I was wondering if there are any gas-fired hot water tanks that have a secondary 'hole' that I could put an electric DC heating element in. I would hook that element up to a solar PV panel or three directly, and let the sun make that tank nice and toasty during the day. Just take whatever hits the panels, totally unregulated, and direct it to warm the tank. Because it would go way above safe temperature, I'd put a thermostatic mixer (mixes hot and cold) to regulate outlet to a safe temp. There's already going to be a pressure-safe vent valve on the system in case it hits boiling point (though my energy input calculations seem to keep that from happening).

Is this nuts? It seems like a really uncomplicated way to put solar to work.

Bonus points if there are gas-fired hot water tanks with a second hole for an electric element *and* a way for me to run a copper coil through so I can recirculate hot water through a baseboard; it would be perfect for those days when I don't want to fire the steam boiler all the way up, but could use a few thousand BTUs to warm things up.",11,1583200880,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fcnasg/want_to_solar_boost_hot_water/,DIY,1

fcmp6p,shalafi71,A bit overwhelmed looking at paint sprayers. Use case and details in post.,"Never used a paint sprayer and there are a lot of options out there.

Primary use case:

I'm putting up a 4' picket fence with 4x4 posts.  I want to paint-as-I-go with an eye towards weather proofing.

For context, I'm in NW Florida so it's not cold, rarely freezing, plenty hot in the summer.  

The fence is primarily to contain my mini pig.  He doesn't mess with the fence but he will get it dirty.  Light power washing will be in order.

Will certainly want it for future projects but the fence is the main thing.  Call it 400' of fence by the time I'm done.  It's probably not going to see much use after this.

I have a 2-gallon air compressor.  Would that small tank be frustrating?  Be willing to buy a bigger one if air is the way to go.

Should I go electric?  Pros and cons over an air compressor?

Oil or latex paint?  Maybe even Kilz?  Since I plan to paint in spurts, ease of cleanup would be nice.  Haven't got the time or money to do this all in one shot.",3,1583198189,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fcmp6p/a_bit_overwhelmed_looking_at_paint_sprayers_use/,DIY,1

First time posting here on the sub, what happened is pretty much in the tittle and couldn’t find a better spot to post this. 

Basically my dad got a nice washing machine and put his shoes in to dry after washing it as he wanted to wear it that day, it melted and liberally coated the interior of the dryer with plastic ([picture of the dryer](https://imgur.com/a/QQvr912)). The machine is a Bosch nexxt 500 series if that will be needed.

I did some research and the most plausible solution was either nail polish remover or lacquer thinner into the machine, wipe it down, then run it with some soapy water to clean it out.

I thought I’d ask here and see if there are any better ideas before I try to fix it. If there are any other sub Reddit’s that would be better to ask inc please point me in their direction.

fclhcs,MissCalculation,How could I remove this blotted out basement window pane?,"I moved into a new place recently, and I'd love to be able to use the basement more often. Unfortunately, it seems like someone who lived here before me spray-painted the basement window panes so that no one could see in -- but the sunlight can't get in either, which sucks, hahaha. I'm not sure what could ever inspire someone to do this, but it happened.

I'm including an Imgur album here with a link of what the situation looks like. My end goal here is just to have a window that sunlight can get through easily. If that means replacing it, paint-stripping it, or whatever else, any solution is good.

The window is about 20"" by 30"". The most exterior part of a window is a [plexi]glass pane with a metal ""rim"" that I can remove (see the picture with the removed pane in my album). The most interior part (so: further away from you than the removable pane if you're looking at the window from the outside) is the painted over pane. It seems to be kind of built into the frame, though, and I don't see any obvious/easy way to remove it. And I can't really see how to get the frame out, either. And even if I could, the size (20"" x 30"") seems pretty non-standard from what I can see online, so I don't know if I could just replace the whole frame with a new one, meaning I'd still have to deal with the painted pane somehow.

Here's the images:

fch9m6,Worried_Departure,Removing tile and installing vinyl planks,"Hello,

We are planning to redo most of our first floor flooring (600 sqf). We currently have tile that is laid underneath the cabinets and will be replacing with the lifeproof luxury vinyl planks. Few options that I'd like your opinion on: 1. lay the lifeproof directly on top of the tile. 2. Remove the tile and use a toe kick saw to cut the tile around the cabinets to save me from having to remove them all. 3. Remove all the cabinets, rip up all the tile, and attach cabinets down to subflooring with vinyl coming up to its edge. 

Option 3 seems like too much work for it's worth and option 1 worries me about durability. Anybody have experience with this that could help me out? We plan to live hear another 5-8 years and need the floor to last through that time.

fcgkdy,TemujinDM,Sealing Basement Concrete Floor,"So my previously finished basement had a plumbing incident that ruined the old epoxy in the kitchen area and carpet in the rest of the basement. I removed the carpet and found that the previous owners who renovated this floor had used house paint and a sealer under the carpet and the water damage caused all of the paint to crack peel and bubble. So I went to HD rented a buffer and stripped the entire floor. I then thoroughly cleaned the floor and applied 2 coats of concrete paint. (2 days of drying time between coats). It looks great so far but I want to add some extra protection to the floor so it doesn’t scratch or chip up. What should I use for a clear coat on top of the paint I’ve put down to seal it and make it more durable?

fcfhe3,beesk,Installing a hand-rail,"A while back I tripped down our stairs and snapped our hand-rail in half, ripping out the top bracket the previous owner had put into drywall.

I put a new one up, should there a bit of a “jiggle” between the bracket and the u-shaped part?

What I mean is should the railing a move a bit when touched? The brackets are firm in the wall, it’s the part where the u-shape locks into the hook. The bottom part moves a bit because the angle was installed by the previous owner. The middle and top don’t jiggle at all, they are firm. My thought is that I angled it too high when re-installing the top bracket (now in a stud). I've seemingly confirmed this by looking at the hook and the u-shaped strip, it's tight and slightly angled. Looking at it straight on from the top of the stairs there's a slight curve, looks like the higher top bracket is putting pressure and twisting the wood slightly enough to not have that wobble. Easy enough fix IMO. 

I can confirm that when the brackets aren't in the wall all of them have movement within the u-shaped strip.

It's a standard turn knob but it doesnt seem to be opening enough. Removing what I can from the handle with a screw driver doesnt help and just reveals the door. 

Im thinking I'm going to have to just kick it through and fix whatever breaks. 

If you have any advice I would greatly appreciate it. I also have a photo for reference but I dont know how to post it on the sub.

fc6ybn,swimmerhair,Furnace not working after re wiring an electrical switch (USA),"I was trying to install a smart switch to a double gang electrical box and unplugged wires. As I was working on the smart switch I had to disconnect everything. Much to my dismay, the switch was not able to be connected, but now my thermostat, which is a few feet away is not powered on.

I go to the furnace, and see that the plug that it is plugged in to is also not working.

As I go back to the switch/gang box, I see that there is a cable with 4 wires, not the typical 3. The colors are red, black, white, and bare which are all disconnected and capped for safety for now.

There are two other wires with the regular 3 wire configuration (black, white and bare). I believe these two wires go to the porch light and the landing light circuitry, but at this point I'm not sure.

Any ideas? Can anyone tell me how I can wire this up just to get my furnace working again?",1,1583125019,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fc6ybn/furnace_not_working_after_re_wiring_an_electrical/,DIY,1

Hi everyone!!

I need a favor. 
I will attach a few photos of my mother in law if I am able to. She is the most beautiful person inside and out. She means a lot to me. Her birthday is coming up this month, in just a few weeks. She suffers from severe Lupus and has had many flares lately so I wanted to do something sweet for her birthday. I saw this done on Facebook a couple years ago but wanted to see if I could make my own. I am needing help from people all over the world to pull it off. :) if anyone who wants to participate could just make a short video saying something like “Happy birthday, Karina!!!! Sending love all the way from (wherever you’re from)”. I want to make a video for her. I think she would really like it. :) We live in Oklahoma so if you’re from another state/country it would be really really cool if you could make a video and send it to my snapchat @ forever_prim or you can private message me for my email! Thank you so much!! If this actually works I’ll post a video of her reaction. :)",1,1583105970,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fc2vs9/help_needed/,DIY,1

fc20de,Tej-jeil,Question on Structure/Engineering Brick durability in a high-heat application.,"Hey guys. I know fire brick is designed for this. But im having a hard time sourcing fire brick with holes in them. 

My idea is to use a left-over pallet of structure brick ive got. 

The idea is to build an octagonal-sphere fireplace with a gap in the middle. 

I plan on using rebar bent through the holes along the interior of the bricks that will span the gap and provide a place for heat to escape and radiate evenly around the sphere. Then to continue the brick above the sphere into a chimney. I would use a steel bowl on the inside of the sphere for the fuel to sit in. And make cleaning easier. 

Question is if strucure brick would be okay to do this with.

fc1euz,Toast-,Best way to support a floating desk?,"I'm pretty inexperienced overall with DIY, but due to space constraints, I want to make a floating desk that would looks something like this:

[https://imgur.com/a/GBOPkRg](https://imgur.com/a/GBOPkRg)

It will be 11 3/4"" deep and somewhere in the neighborhood of 4'-7' long (I have to see what looks best in the space).

Here's the good news. **The wall I'm building on is completely open on the backside, as that goes to the under stair storage**. Considering I have kids, I'd like for this to safely hold enough weight to be toddler-proof in the event they try to hang off of it or something. From what I can tell, french cleats might be okay, but something that attaches from the other side of the wall would be ideal.

Searching around seemed to only be for low-weight solutions, then I came across countertop support brackets, like [this](https://www.countertopbracket.com/countertop-support-bracket-front-mount-p/fmb.htm) or [this](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/f659a04d-ebdc-41df-a34d-ee558c1323ec_1.5e5ceb89b14186587f8437c95297ad11.jpeg). 

I imagine 3-4 of those should easily make this thing strong enough for my needs, and they could be attached to 2x4's behind the wall then just extend out through the drywall.

Do those brackets seem like the best option, or is there something I'm unaware of that might be easier?",17,1583099868,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fc1euz/best_way_to_support_a_floating_desk/,DIY,1

i have had mixed opinons from people saying, it will be fine, or it wont be fine. so whats the general thoughts here. 

im leaning toward getting some prep stuff and tiling over what is there as the rest of the wall area is solid, so the full skim or dot and dab is a extra chunk of money as i cant skim well enough to the point id trust tiling",2,1583091666,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fbzck7/opinions_needed_from_tilers/,DIY,1

fby2x5,ec019,Covering Electrical Panel? (UK),"Hi everyone. I was born and raised in Canada, and a few years ago I moved to the UK. I've always been a bit of a DIY-er with most things growing up, and I really enjoy fixing up my rental apartment (the landlord is cool with it, she's totally awesome!).

I live in an apartment building, and the entryway closet has all of my electrical stuff in it. It's kind of ugly looking and I'm going to paint it so it's brighter. I use this closet to store tools and household things on the left, and extra bedding and stuff on the right. In the bottom half there is space to hang things.

What I can't seem to figure out is if that are any rules or regulations -- or common sense! -- that would apply if I wanted to put a cover over this. Obviously it needs to be accessible, so I'm just thinking about making an L-shaped cover from some plywood to go on the lower shelf.

https://preview.redd.it/yckjbth7r3k41.jpg?width=2736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03af604a647a552c61374000fd0f6aec233df2f3

The top beige thing is the electricity meter; it's a prepaid meter where you add credit onto a key at a local shop and then insert it into the meter and it works like a parking meter, sorta.

Below is the fuse panel, which I am told is old. This apartment tower was built in the late 60s, so this is probably original to the building. The fuses are re-wireable: there is a 5 amp lighting circuit, 15 amp ring main for sockets, and two 30 amp circuits for the cooker and water heater. An electrician who was here last year doing some work for the landlord assured me it was still safe, it's just old. From what I understand, when the current is too high, it melts the fuse and needs to be rewired. 

None of this gets warm, and I was just thinking about making an L-shaped cover from some plywood, just to cover the ugliness on the bottom shelf. Is there any reason why this might not be a good idea?",6,1583086725,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fby2x5/covering_electrical_panel_uk/,DIY,1

I’ve always wanted a secret door to my secret panic room / office / gun room / prepper room. Ever since I was a kid and watched dexters lab.   
   
Now that I’m a new home owner I get to do whatever I want and no one can tell me otherwise.   
   
This is the room in question. I want to build a secret door. Now, it can be a book shelf. Or a mirror. Or anything cool that allows for a hidden door. But it has to look plausible in this corner.  
   
The corner that the door sits in is potentially a problem due to how it’s angled.   
   
I still believe there’s a really cool way to do this but there isn’t much online for secret door stuff. Even on Pinterest I’ve seen pretty much everything.   
   
If I do a book shelf style it’s going to require more depth. Which is going to impede on my office behind there.

fbsn68,malrats,Looking to fix VERY creaky upstairs bedroom floors. Bedroom is carpeted (Berber?). Do I have to worry about pipes/electrical wiring under floors? Please help!,"So, I just moved into a new house yesterday and my bedroom is above my parents’ master bedroom. The floor has been immensely creaky/squeaky ever since I first saw the house with the realtor, but then the flooring company had said they would take care of it when they were putting in new carpeting. They didn’t.

I wouldn’t have too much of an issue with it if it weren’t for the fact that I’m awake nights and the creak is SO loud that it sounds like hammering and banging sounds from the bedroom below and I’m afraid that I’m going to be keeping people awake/otherwise creating a very annoying situation at all times.

I watched quite a few videos and understand the concept of the nails through the sub boards being loose (the house is from 1999 so I don’t imagine they used glued nails) and then moving up and down loosely being the source of the sound. The home was VERY thoroughly inspected pre-purchase and there was never any mention of structural damage of any sort. 

So I began looking into those “Squeak No More!” sorts of repair kits that can go through carpet and allegedly fix the sound by screwing the boards back into the joists using perforated screws where the top portion snaps off beneath the carpet using the included tool (I watched a decent amount of videos of people using them to fix the EXACT sound that I’m hearing and it went from 100% to 0% after putting all of the screws in). However, I have two concerns:

1) I’ve heard people mention screwing into pipes and electrical wiring through the floor when drilling through to try to find the joists. I always thought that the pipes and wiring were in the walls and not the floors and ceilings. Is that something that I should be immediately worried about, enough so to stray from trying to do this myself, and otherwise would there be a way for me to check if there is plumbing or electricity under the sub boards?

2) My carpeting is, I believe, Berber. I think that’s the word for it. It’s very plush and seems to have individual fibers throughout rather than just being a flat piece of material. I recall reading that the kit includes “one taped sample screw for Berber carpet” that seems to have Scotch tape on it to keep the threads from catching the fibers in the carpet. Would anyone be able to elaborate on how that works?

So basically, I really want/need to get this immense creaking sound gone. The rooms are large (20’ x 13’) and with extra tall ceilings (at least a foot or two+ taller than any bedroom I’ve ever lived in) and so the sound is amplified even more and echos. It’s already driving me nuts and even though my furniture is mostly already moved in, I wanted to see first if there is anything I can do about this myself (as an amateur, I should be very clear about that). The last thing I want to do is either destroy the carpet somehow or even worse, drill into a pipe or something and basically ruin the house. I haven’t seen any cases of people doing that, but quite a few people in YouTube comments were saying things like “enjoy paying the plumber afterwards to fix the pipes you drill into!” and other things to that effect, so I wanted to get some insight if possible. Also, the home was custom built in 1999/2000ish so I don’t know if that changes anything or if houses are built the same regardless.

Thank you to anyone who can offer any help. I would really, really appreciate it!",48,1583060930,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fbsn68/looking_to_fix_very_creaky_upstairs_bedroom/,DIY,1

fbo80a,IWantToBeYourGirl,Need help with a durable weather proof pet door flap ~ Ideas please,"I'm at my wits end and need some ideas for a solution.  I have two PetSafe pet doors size large.  One is a single flap in a storm door leaving an enclosed porch and the other is a weather insulated model in an exterior door accessing the enclosed porch. 

The problem I have is the dogs keep getting the magnets off the bottom of the flaps and the magnets are not sold separately from replacement flaps.  Eventually they chew the corners on the flaps too.  I have yet to catch them in the act, just the aftermath.

Replacement flaps are $42 each at Lowes, a bit cheaper on Amazon.  I bit the bullet and ordered a couple off-brand flaps at the bargain price of $27 each.  I bought some of that stop-nail-bite polish and coated the bottoms/magnets on each.  4 hours later, the magnet is missing and the flap won't seal shut.  

My porch gets a good bit of wind from the north and cold air blows right through both dog doors and into the house when the magnets aren't there to engage.  I tried adding some silicone door sweep with adhesive to go around the door but that impedes the flap opening and closing properly.

fbfyyn,Spectre32115,Chain Link Fence Question,"Thanks for taking a peek, first and foremost. To start this off, the reason for the question. I've reached out to a few fencing companies to try to accomplish what I want to, and they've basically said it'd be too expensive for them to do it. What I want to do is upgrade a section of chain link fence leading into my back yard. The space is about 22.5 feet, and currently has an existing fence, but we bought a pontoon and want to be able to get it into the back yard, which means the pedestrian gate isn't large enough. What I want to do is remove the existing chain link, but keep the end posts on both sides, and install my own dual gate system. Something like a 12 foot and 10 foot swinging fence that meet in the middle with a drop rod. 

My question: is that something that would be able to be done relatively easy and cheaply? The places I've talked to so far have said it'd be upwards of $2000 to replace that because the end posts would need to be upgraded to support the weight of the fence, which I think I could mitigate just by installing some casters onto the gate itself. I'm not very DIY savvy, but I'm willing to give it a try it it's not something that would actually cost me 2 grand for.",10,1582997842,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fbfyyn/chain_link_fence_question/,DIY,1

fbfaf7,EquilibriumVs,Kitchen Makeover,"Mew homeowner here. Old house and the kitchen showed it the worst so we decided to paint it. 

[Here's](https://imgur.com/gallery/WsF32RR) the before and after.  

Started off by taking the doors off, degreasing, and sanding everything with 120 grit. Got the details with a sanding sponge. Wiped everything down and primed both sides. Because of the drastic change in color, I primed one more time after sanding with 220 grit. Then painted two coats of color. Sanding between each coat. 

For the cabinets it was the same process but I only primed once and did not sand between coats. 

I bought new hinges and handles as well because the old ones may have been from the 20th century. 

My first attempt at improving my house. It turned out better than I'd hoped.",13,1582995174,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fbfaf7/kitchen_makeover/,DIY,1

 Main wall on chimney breast captures light very well so can see mistakes.

  


Mistake 1. Painted testers here

Painted over it and could see streaks where previous testers were (not in colour but bumps)

Tried hand sanding didn't work.

Mistake 2. Tried round sander, repainted that looked even worse.

  


Is there a way to fix this please without replastering entire wall?!

fbexhe,FliptheBricks,Basement moisture mitigation,"Basement moisture issues

Bought this house last April, moisture issues were noted in the inspection which I wasn’t too concerned about. However the slope of the yard towards the house didn’t occur to me as such an issue.
My plan is to dig away all the earth around the basement, power wash, and seal the wall with something like this Liquid Rubber Foundation Sealant, Black 5 Gallon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071X7TYYM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_rYtwEbDJN0VJQ
Then replace the drainage pipe, sleeve and backfill with 2’x4’ gravel at the base. Cover with soil.
Then, put in a retaining wall where the parking area is, level the yard, and use the moved earth to slope away from the house.

The current state is a 6’ drop over 30’, so -1:5 slope. 

My question is since I’m only having effervescence in the basement and not visible liquid, is this all necessary? Or could I make it work by just building the retaining wall and using that dirt for a slope away from the house?

This issue is preventing me from putting in flooring in the basement and overall refinishing it so it’s kind of my bottle neck right now. 

South western Virginia, 6b. 

Thanks in advance guys!

fb6583,assntitties78,Garage concrete flooring," The concrete flooring of my attached garage is in ruin. The outer masonry foundation of the garage is sound, but the flooring has no reinforcement and the change in elevation beneath the concrete has caused numerous major cracks.

My hope is to do as much of the renovation as possible before contracting out to have the concrete laid and finished, but I have some questions that I cant find in my research.

The ground beneath the existing concrete definitely needs leveled. Is this something that can be done with stone alone? Or will I need to level the ground with dirt before stone is laid?

Also, I want to reinforce the new concrete to prevent future major damage. Does reinforcement for a garage slab simply sit on top of the stone layer? I understand you want the reinforcement to sit in the top 1/3 of your concrete, but how do I elevate the reinforcement above the layer of stone?  
Does the reinforcement need to be stabilized in the outer foundation of the garage or in the ground below?

I have drilled into these blocks once before. I previously fitted some very large expanding anchors. If I remember correctly, wall 'A' was difficult to drill into and very crumbly, while wall 'B' more dusty.  Of the 8 anchors that were fitted, only 7 took hold properly.

faxhga,TheSleepingNinja,Replacing a doorbell transformer when you can't find the transformer,"So my doorbells died about a year or so ago and I'm just now getting a second to look into repairing the system.    
There are two pushbuttons in the house, one at the front door and one on the side door with a chime located on the main floor in the middle of the house, and additional chimes in the basement and attic.  

Using a tone and probe I traced the power line down out of the main chime into the basement to one location where there's a split in the chime wires to run to the attic and basement.   
This split is RIGHT next to a conduit box that, for some reason, has two circuits of 20A run to it. Further tracing from this point on what looks like the transformer wire just runs off in a random direction above the ceiling in the basement - away from the breaker panel. I've tried tracing this power line back but whoever ran it put it alongside what I can only assume is the hardline running to the front doorbell. Without completely destroying the ceiling I don't really have a means of seeing where any of this goes.   

So, I guess my main question is can I install a replacement transformer at that Y-Split and tap into the extra 20A 120v circuit in the conduit box, and leave the dead/malfunctioning transformer wherever it is in the wall, or will I run into issues sending 16v down the line to the door buzzers that may or may not have another power source still attached?",13,1582908151,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/faxhga/replacing_a_doorbell_transformer_when_you_cant/,DIY,1

The space is 4' deep, 10' wide, and &gt; 10' tall, and there's a short (maybe 2' or 3') wall, then the railings. My tentative plan is to put 4x4s in the corners, with boards connecting the tops and bottoms of the sides against the walls, as well as a board across the front (which will support the planters). 

[Here's a very rough, quick sketch of what I'm thinking](https://i.imgur.com/mFRiSKn.jpg).

I'm worried about how secure this will be if we get a big gust of wind - possibly sending the structure toppling over and onto the street. Obviously, since we're renting, we can't drill into the concrete walls or permanently attach anything to the structure.

Here in India, we need to use a motor to pump water up to an apartment's tank. The local water corporation provides it only for a few hours per day so we need to ensure that the motor doesn't run out of hours lest it burns out and results in expensive repairs. Sometime ago, my parents got a float switch installed in the tank probably at the recommendation of some electrician. The problem is that the float switch can switch on the motor too. So if the tank ever runs lower than the on level out of supply hours, it will end up burning the motor. Is there any way to ensure that the motor only switches off when the water level reaches a certain level, but never switches on by itself?

The floor measures around 3'x4'... no joke.  The toilet sits on the inner wall and the pedestal sink sits against the exterior (rear) wall.  When I go to sit down my shoes cannot fit between the toilet and the sink without turning so they go through long-ways... The length of my shoes cannot fit between the sink pedestal and the toilet.  


The other wall opposite the toilet and sink from the door is only a half foot from the toilet itself.  However, behind that wall is nothing but kitchen cabinets, on the shortest wall in the kitchen... maybe 4-5' long... I'll have to measure.  


What I want to do is move that wall over about 2', enough to place the pedestal sink on the same side of the bathroom alongside the toilet, creating about a 2x5' space to walk in as you approach either toilet or sink.  That would allow the toilet to remain as-is, thus cutting cost.  


The wall has one light fixture and one outlet installed, but I've done a fair bit of wiring and I'm honestly not too worried about dealing with it.  


But my wife keeps on thinking this is going to cost $10,000 and I'm like ""now way in hell""... I could really use a ballpark figure.  We're just demoing 5' of wall at most, building another 7' of wall, (5 to replace the original but 2' further out)... and with that wall installing one outlet and one light fixture.  Relocating one pedestal sink.  It's not a load-bearing wall, I've identified that wall as the one opposite the hall where this bathroom is.  The ceiling area might be a slight issue as there's inset lighting in-front of the cabinets, they may need to be relocated.  


Just want a few opinions... what's your guys' thoughts on a ballpark figure?  Is this something I can really do myself?  Do I really need a structural engineer to come out if I know where the loadbearing wall is and isn't? Is there something I'm not thinking about?

fap237,FlatConcentrate1,DIY:Best Comprehensive Magnetic Knife For Your Kitchen," 

Constructing a Magnetic Knife Holder is a popular project using our neodymium magnets. Here we've built our own using simple construction methods and include what magnet sizes can work best! The construction really is pretty simple, but the choice of magnets is where it can be more difficult to decide what will work best.  


## Materials include:

**1.wood of your choice**

**2.**[**disc neodymium magnets**](https://magnetshub.com/collections/disc)

**3.glue**

**4.adhesive and screws.**  


## Tools:

**1.Table saw**

**2.router**

**3.drill**

### Step 1: Cut Out Desired Size

Cut out a block of flat timber to size. Ours is 2"" tall and 16"" wide, from 3/4"" thick cherry. In hindsight, 18"" is probably nicer. We have heard from some parents who need to make a fancy design, say the letter K for kitchen. Whatever your layout is, the manner continues to be the same.

### Step 2: Create a Fixture for the Groove

We created a fixture for cutting the groove in a nice, immediately line with a handheld router. At this point, you should decide which face of the wood is nicer, so you can cut the groove on the opposite side. You may additionally have a different manner to do this, or other gear that may be used. With the gear we've got here, this changed into the quality alternative for us.  


This simple fixture is crafted from some MDF board and is sized to our router. We used a desk saw to reduce out the hole in the MDF board, but a Jigsaw or Bandsaw may paintings better (and be safer!).

### Step 3: Cut the Groove

Using the fixture and router, we reduce the groove inside the again of the knife holder. Make sure to set the intensity nicely to depart the favored thickness of wood. We left 1/16"" thickness of ultimate wood.  


This is where a few technical facts approximately magnets comes into play, but it's far simple. The much less material left, the smaller (and cheaper) magnets you can use. The more cloth, the stronger the magnets will need to be to correctly hold the knives. We assume 1/16"" of material left is a superb thickness. This means we set the router intensity to 11/16"".

### Step 4: Route the Other Edges and Sand

After cutting the groove, we desired to have a nice fillet on the other edges, so we used the router for this. Again, your design is probably different, ours is quite simple. We then sanded the groove and piece smooth. At this point, all major cuts at the block are finished, so that you can sand to complete as well.

### Step 5: Insert Disc Neodymium Magnets!

This subsequent step is our favorite part, placing the magnets! We placed the block on a steel cookie sheet, to help maintain the magnets in vicinity at the same time as setting them into the groove. We positioned paper in between to protect our finishing sand. Our groove is 1/2"" extensive and we used [1/2"" x 3/16"" magnets](https://magnetshub.com/collections/disc/products/100-pcs-disc-neodymium-magnets-size-12-3mm-n52-nickelni-cu-ni)  


The orientation of the magnets is important. They have to be positioned in alternating polarities. If you have a look at the magnets, the poles could be North, South, North, South, etc. The edges attract on this orientation, so you will understand if they are being installed right. If you try and place them facet by aspect and the magnets repel, genuinely flip one of the magnets so it attracts.  


Note: Neodymium magnets are very hard and brittle. If they're allowed to slam together, they could probably break. This process must be carried out carefully. The steel cookie sheet clearly helps keep the magnets down in order that they do not slam to each other.

### Step 6: Adhere the Magnets in Place

In this last step, we adhere the magnets in vicinity even as still at the steel sheet. While many different sorts of adhesives will work well, we used a silicone adhesive. Make sure to cover all of the magnets along the whole groove. Don't be afraid to be generous with the adhesive!  


After the adhesive dries, you can finish the block with something finish you choose (oil, stain, wax, etc).

### Step 7: Install the Block

Once the adhesive is dry and your block is finished, its time **to put in** the block! We **fastened** it to the wall **the usage of** screws for a quick, **clean** install.  


Make **positive** you drill a pilot **hole** **earlier than** screwing! It **could** be **terrible** to get all this **manner** **after which** crack the **timber** with a screw. Once your block is **fixed** to the wall (or **anyplace** you **place** it), **area** your knifes to the block and enjoy!

Hi all! Sorry this might not be the most typical post for here, but any DIY solutions are also welcomed. I’m a young female and don’t know much about home improvement/cleaning. But my apartment has had this unpleasant, earthy smell for almost half a year, and I’m going crazy trying to combat it. I’m wondering if there’s mold. The only picture I can manage to snap is this space between my dishwasher and the floor/wall, and I don’t know if this explains it. Does this look like mold? 
There’s been a history of water leakages, but that only affected my landlords downstairs and there were no leaks on my floor of the apartment. Could this still affect my unit in terms of mold?",1,1582862893,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/faoux7/does_my_house_have_mold_picture/,DIY,1

A few local places are trying to push me to just replace the entire water heater, but that seems a bit overkill. I have the replacement pilot assembly on order, but... how important even is this?

*TL;DR Something is deeply wrong with our relationship to the things that we own because we often have no relationship to the process of making it, and we think a Reddit native project could be part of a solution to this.*

&amp;#x200B;

[The Locke Marx Pork Chop \(this will make sense later, but only sort of\)](https://preview.redd.it/84to7of7mgj41.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3400de6dc8bbd5efcf2b0de4c4540f1adb2730b)

The Marx Locke Pork Chop (this will make sense later, but only sort of)

# Marx, Locke, and “Proper Ownership”

Karl Marx and John Locke have very little in common. Marx wrote much of the theoretical basis for Communism, while Locke famously used his argument for the foundational right to private property as the keystone on which to define limits for the extent of civil government. They get to wildly different conclusions about how we ought to organize society, but there is a revealing similarity in the relationship between individuals and their property that they both use as a fundamental assumption of their theory.

Both Marx and Locke thought that the most natural type of ownership came from *being involved in the creation of the good that is owned.*

# Acorns and Property

Locke approaches it this way. Let’s do a thought experiment: there is no government, no state, no laws, etc. and we are in what thinkers from his time call a “state of nature” — which is to say, plopped down on the earth with no pre-existing human society.

You and I live on opposite sides of a meadow, and in that meadow there are acorns. Neither of us really could say we “own” the acorns — they’re just there in the meadow and we both happen to live nearby, gathering acorns, using them as a common good.

Unfortunately, acorns are hard to make edible. They need to be ground, boiled, etc. to be made useful. When we’re both gathering the acorns it’s pretty obvious that they’re fair game. But, if you’ve boiled, ground, and prepared a bunch of acorns to eat and I come over to your side of the meadow and gather up all the acorn flour you spent all day preparing to bring over to my side, *it’s obvious I’m doing something dickish*.

Why?

Well you’ve mixed your labor with the acorns to make them into something different. That new, different value — the acorn flour — is yours. Your mind and your body are yours (we take that as an obvious given), and new value the acorns have as ready food is something that sprang from your mind, and actions you took with your body. The edible acorn paste is *yours* because you participated in its creation, its value is an extension of yourself. The concept Locke creates here is that before money or exchange of value,[ the original and fundamental form of ownership](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/politics/locke/ch05.htm) comes from those who have mixed their labor into the creation of something.

Marx, being Marx, is not using some thought experiment but is assessing the nature of[ workers and their relationship to the fruits of their labour in a capitalist society](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/manuscripts/labour.htm). Marx wouldn’t use the language of property as Locke does, and instead talks about how the sickness of his early-industrial capital came from alienation. This meant alienation of the worker from his own labour, and from the product of his labour: the worker would rent out his work (renting out his body) to perform repetitive tasks and produce something that he would never be able to afford.

A worker, screwing a bolt over and over again in an assembly line, onto a car he will never be able to buy, experiences a sense of alienation from his labor, the product of his labor, and  (because our own productive labor is so inextricably linked to our human identity and selfhood ) himself. If you spend, instead, 10 hours every Saturday working on building your new gardening shed, that would likely provide much more fulfillment.

I am not here to endorse or defend either political philosophy: instead I want to highlight that (despite coming from opposite ends of the political theory spectrum) both of these imply we ought to have some ownership over the product of labour — that it is a basic and true form of ownership, that the participation of creation in something generates a special relationship to the product.

But let’s flip that on its head and start not from the laborer and whether he should own what he creates, but from the consumer. What does it do to a *consumer* to have had no participation in the act of creation?

# Consumers, Proper Ownership, and Moral Distance

Let’s start with this: there is something different about our relationship to *things we own that we helped to create* and *things that we own that we did not help to create*. While the two above examples are using this concept in high-falootin’ political discourse, I think this is an extremely relatable idea.

If you’ve ever done work on a car, built a gaming desktop for yourself, cooked a meal, or done any kind of project where you’re involved in the creation of something you own, you understand that ***you hold a different relationship to that thing than you do to something you buy***. Maybe you’re more likely to fix it than to throw it out, or more likely to upgrade and improve it than replace it with a newer model and toss out the old. This kind of connection and relationship engendered by participation in the process of making things is what I’ll call “proper ownership”.

It doesn’t even need to be something that was entirely your creation: my business partner bought himself a white jumpsuit and went to a dye-shop to dye it blue. The experience taught him a lot about dyeing, about the effect that has on the environment in large factories, and even about how to look at color. That jumpsuit is his favorite article of clothing — he wears it all the time and I’m sure if it broke he would try to fix it rather than replace it. ***Anecdotally, at least, it seems that the “bad” behaviour of consumerism is less pronounced when the person owning the product is also a participant in its production.***

So why do we behave differently with objects that we just buy from stores? We lack any connection to the process of production, which both makes the object alien to us (we have no personal connection with it, which makes it more disposable), and also allows for “moral distance” between us and the process of production (we don’t know how it was made, and don’t care to ask — it isn’t our business, and we’re just using the final product).

What I mean by “moral distance” is this: let’s say you have two neighbors, both pig farmers. If one neighbor mistreated his pigs egregiously and the other one did not, almost anyone would prefer to give their business to the neighbor who was nice to his pigs. But, we don’t have that kind of closeness with the production of our goods. Instead, we see two pork chops vacuum sealed in a grocery store, side by side. Most people don’t even think about their origin, and it would take work to get an answer. As a result, we might buy pork from the evil pork farmer, helping him stay in business, and leading to more pigs being mistreated. ***Your experience as a consumer is built around receiving the final product with complete separation from the process of production.***

So what is the consequence of “moral distance”?

***Our complete separation from the process of production, as consumers, might be an underlying sickness that diminishes the value we get from our belongings and also leads to negative externalities we would not consciously abide.*** There is a dissonance between what we value and what we support with our purchasing decisions — and the utter separation between our consumptive experience and the production of consumer goods exasperates this. The “moral distance” we have from production results in decisions we wish we didn’t make.

Depending on who you are this could manifest as seemingly innocuous purchases of ground beef at a supermarket that feed a meat industry practicing mass cruelty while damaging the environment, creating superbugs (through the abuse of[ antibiotics](https://www.cornucopia.org/2012/11/resistance-to-important-antibiotic-may-develop-in-soil-study-shows/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA-bjyBRCcARIsAFboWg2HIx1bMNY84qdfbpBTsqVThASpLSUWqCVqV-THFLIstgLZ3jfM0dQaAri0EALw_wcB), for example), etc. , or it could manifest as convenient clothing purchases of fast fashion — supporting an industry that[ produces more carbon emissions than aviation and shipping combined](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035161).

The clothing industry is a particularly good example of this, especially because the disconnection between the consumer and the production leads to sub-optimal product design as well as negative environmental externalities (which I’ve previously posted about[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/dz3en3/why_isnt_clothing_better_than_it_was_30_years_ago/)).

There is a rising understanding of these problems in the mainstream, at least at a superficial level. And that superficial understanding has led to a lot of helpful (if superficial) solutions. In every vein of consumptive goods there have popped up brands whose essential promise is diminishing those negative externalities, whether it be through ethical sourcing, sustainable production, what-have-you.

***Companies that do things like***[ ***make t-shirts out of algae***](https://www.vollebak.com/product/plant-and-algae-t-shirt/)***, are attempting to treat the symptom (negative externalities) without addressing the underlying cause (consumer decisions caused by their separation from design and production)*****.** In many cases, early adopter consumers are willing to use these services — but are almost invariably paying a premium to lower negative externalities. There is, almost universally, either a higher cost for the same utility or a lower utility at the same cost if a good is “ethical.”

But what would happen if we focused on the core of the problem, increasing the connection between consumer and product by involving them in the process of creation? Could a system that encourages more “proper ownership” and eliminates “moral distance” create better outcomes for users as well as reducing negative externalities in production?

# Experimenting With A Lasting Solution

A real, robust solution would require a change in approach that *both involves users more closely in production and creates better value products.* The solution, then, is to increase consumers’ interaction with product design and production decisions: the more interaction consumers can have with design the better suited the product becomes (producing more value for the users) and the less alienation they have from the process of production (producing a greater connection between consumer and product). In practice, this would look like a company primarily focused on ***participatory design: achieving the highest possible bandwidth of communication between the users and the decision makers of production, and iterating on sourcing and design decisions based on user feedback.***

*To put it more concisely, a company who designs clothes* ***with*** *their community not just* ***for*** *their community.*

https://preview.redd.it/3p8j5skkmgj41.png?width=482&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a46840ec4a81f1dbc06b65bee71eae53e5980a7e

Kind of like this

This new type of company is possible now (at scale) in a way that it has never been before. In the world of pre-industrialization (Locke), or early industrialization (Marx), there existed no platform where such an information exchange could live — and barriers to creating companies (capital requirements for brick and mortar, limited media avenues for customer acquisition) were much larger.

Now, a clothing brand can be run from a computer with a global production line, a Shopify storefront, and an online portal receiving detailed feedback from every user of the product. Designs can be updated and tweaked in a constant iterative loop with direct feedback from their users, and then updated patterns and tech packs can be sent to factories instantly for the next production order.

The next question is: what platform makes the most sense for this company to live on?

We think the answer is reddit. It is the only platform that is simultaneously:

**-High Bandwidth**: permits long form, nuanced discussion — no constrictive character or size limit and a culture that celebrates long form text posts

**-Multi-directional:** decision makers can talk to consumers, consumers to decision makers, and consumers to each other

**-Multimedia**: video, text, image commingled

**-Transparent:** anyone can come and see the conversations that are happening

And, perhaps most importantly, *some of the important conversations already live here*. For a clothing company, like ourselves (at r/MeritStore if you're curious), that means rich design discussions from subs like[ r/MaleFashionAdvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/), sourcing conversations on subs like[ r/EthicalFashion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalfashion/), and more.  This general approach of getting users even lightly involved in the process of making goods could have an impact in almost any type of company, though.",1,1582806554,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fabdrd/marx_locke_reddit_and_the_impact_of_being/,DIY,1

fa8hd2,sort_of_hungry,Screws falling out of chipboard tabletop?,"Hello, 

I have a chipboard table that has a problem with racking. I've been working on the racking by using what I thought was better screws (the other screws were too small so some of the legs were loose) but what I've discovered is that with the new screws in (button head screws this time) and the table up, if I move the table a bit the legs buckle and the screws just fall out due to the leg bracket moving. 

Can I do anything to fix this? Otherwise I'm thinking about just replacing the tabletop with something a bit stronger, but I've never made a table top before so that's only sort of on the cards.",11,1582788312,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fa8hd2/screws_falling_out_of_chipboard_tabletop/,DIY,1

fa3uee,apeirophobicmyopic,I fixed my own garbage disposal and I couldn’t be more happy!,"My garbage disposal stopped working entirely and was making no noise at all.  I saw sites online that said that they must be replaced if this is the case after you make sure that the electrical outlet is working.  I just wanted to let everyone know that it is possible and easier than I thought to diy and to possibly save on a replacement bill!

Here is the link to the YouTube video I followed for a visual reference: [How to Repair your garbage disposal](https://youtu.be/5xFUJIUsHVI)

First, I made sure that the outlet was working.  After that, I made sure to unplug the disposal.  Next, I checked to see whether the small red reset switch located underneath the unit was sticking out (if something has jammed it, it will be sticking out about 1/4”).  It was sticking out, so I pressed the reset button and plugged it back in.  It made a faint whirring sound when turned on, and I could tell something was stuck in it.

In the very center of the bottom of the unit is an little hole that you can place a 1/4” Allen wrench into and physically rotate the inside of your unit.  The YouTube video said that sometimes you can dislodge whatever is jamming it by turning it, but this did not work in my case.  I could, however, tell that there was something lodged in there.  

Once again, I unplugged the unit and disconnected the pipe from the right side that connected it to the drain (very simple, shown in the video).  Then I used a screwdriver to rotate the metal disc that attached the unit to the bottom of the sink and removed it.  The video used 2 screwdrivers, but I found it fairly easy with one.  The unit is very heavy, so be sure to support it from the bottom.  

Then I had to take off the rubber top (it’s not connected to anything, but I had to use a flathead to pry it off.  The unit in the video is very clean, but if yours has stopped up you may have some gunk in there like I did.  I placed a bucket under the pipe sticking out of the side and flushed everything out with water so I could see what was going on in there.

Somehow, a small rock had made its way into there, and I removed it.  It must have happened when I was washing out my plant’s pot (will NOT make that mistake again..)

I placed the metal disc and rubber top back on and connected it to the drain pipe.  You have to be careful lining up the metal disc with the bottom of the sink where it screws on, or it will only catch one of three grooves and won’t work.  

I plugged it back in and it is now humming like new!",5,1582765322,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fa3uee/i_fixed_my_own_garbage_disposal_and_i_couldnt_be/,DIY,1

fa3tcb,blockyworld9926,Steam Engine Model For School,"I'm making a working ""steam"" engine for a school project. However, I decided against using steam because it it hard to make and pressurize at school, and it can also be dangerous. 

Instead, I'm powering the engine from compressed air (its a fairly small engine). The engine needs to run for about an hour, so I need some sort of compressor/pump. It needs to be quiet because I'm taking it to an event with lots of people, and it needs to be small enough so that I can fit it in my backpack. (Also not that expensive, something under 15 bucks. I know, I'm a broke high school student)

As far as air flow demand, all I need is about 10-15 psi with decent air flow. Do you guys know of any pump or compressor thats up for the job? Also could there be a better way to power it than compressed air?",5,1582765202,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fa3tcb/steam_engine_model_for_school/,DIY,1
fa3nav,cnhn,Building a unit in the back of my property. Which Professional do you engage first?,"Long story short I have read all my cities permiting package preparation, I have had the city conduct their parcel information search, so zoning and everything is good. So up next is to develop real cost estimates for the project.  Among the various plans I need to submit are three that seem to be crosslinked, but I can't figure out which goes first.

the three are:

* architectural 
* site
* foundation

Foundation is in there because it contains not just the foundations but the retaining walls.  this project is definately going to need retaining walls, but I don't even know if it's possible to make it a slab or pier and post

site is in there because it would show where it's going but if I don't know the where's and whys of the retaining walls, I think I would end up getting a current version and then going to get a permit version

architectural is there because it can either drive the retaining wall locations or the retaining wall location would drive the architectural.

So who likely be the correct professional to get something on the baord so I can start working up an estimate?",21,1582764464,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fa3nav/building_a_unit_in_the_back_of_my_property_which/,DIY,1

fa3bu4,Srapture,Trying to install aux port in 2003-2007 (7th Gen) Honda Accord,"Had this car for a couple months or so and loving it, but my current music solution of bluetooth radio transmitter isn't giving me the audio quality I would like.

I've seen a couple of aux kits which connect to the bottom of the radio, and some Bluetooth kits as well.

Problem is that the Bluetooth kits seem to either run up to £120 (insane prices) or there are £25 versions from China that would take 2 months to get here. I don't remember that being the case, even from China, in recent years. Seems like a ridiculous wait.

I don't want to get ripped off here, so I was hoping someone could fill me in on some information:

Firstly, does this port have a specific name? Searching ""Honda accord aux port"" makes me feel like I'm searching ""PS4 controller cable"" because I don't know what a USB port is called. Like, I'll get some relevant results but way less than I could be.

Secondly, I haven't found the exact part for my car, specifically, but there seems to be small ~£10 wiring harnesses to convert the connector to a different aftermarket standard. I can imagine these kits would be way cheaper and easier to find with generic connectors. So, is this the case, and would the radio controls still be able to change tracks via Bluetooth (A2DP?) or would this functionality be lost.

Would appreciate any help here. There doesn't seem to be a large community of people knowledgeable about this sort of thing (that I can find)",68,1582763113,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/fa3bu4/trying_to_install_aux_port_in_20032007_7th_gen/,DIY,1
fa35ls,SpunkMunkee001,Looking for ideas for Personal/Portable/Micro Steam-Room.,"So my idea began with this nifty portable clothes steamer that my cousin got me for Christmas.  It's great at what it does, and I've been loving it, although I've been also using it just to steam my face when I wake up and before I go to bed, inhaling a bit of the steam.  This lead me to the idea of creating a micro steam room to further the experience.  My idea is to construct a 2'-3' diameter tube from visqueen and metal/bamboo hoops.  This ""tube"" would be capped at one end, which would hang from the ceiling.  The tube would be collapsible, and able to be secured in the ""closed""/retracted position.  To be used, get underneath, drop it down, and either hold the steamer or put at feet, and relax for a minute.  The only part I can't figure out is how to quickly mitigate some of the steam, like within 30 or so seconds.  I realize this is not a job for a typical dehumidifier, but rather what I'm looking for may be some kind of steam filter?  I'd like to just get most of it out so it doesn't mold the place up.  Maybe I'm being anal about it, but it would be quite a bit of steam.  Anyhow, looking for ideas, improvements in general, and with emphasis on the steam mitigation.

f9xwoy,ufo_pilot,Plumbing for 2 vanity's,"I am redoing my bathroom, and I have decided to 2 individual vanity's, instead of dual sink single vanity.  I am going to move the waste line into the wall, but I am stuck on how to connect both drain lines.  Every image I see is for a dual sink vanity.  So I have to configurations, andd need to figure out which one is best.

https://imgur.com/gallery/rywUgZL

Option 1:
*Both vanity's have a p trap that leads into the wall.  
*The left vanity will then have a 90 elbow that leads a 1 1/2 PVC pipe to a Wye fitting.
*The right vanity will have a 90 elbow that leads the PVC straight down into the Wye fitting.
*From there it will connect to the existing drain line at either a 90 or a tee, depending on how it is connected.

Option 2
*Both vanity's have a p trap that leads into the wall. 
*Both vanity's have 90 elbow that leads to a tee
*From the tee, the PVC heads under the house to the drain

Is there an option that is more acceptable?  I see option 2 more often, but the sinks will be more than 30"" apart.

I know I have to vent them, I need to locate vent first, I just want to figure out this part.",6,1582742500,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/f9xwoy/plumbing_for_2_vanitys/,DIY,1

f9v3bn,Pyronic_Chaos,DIY Heated Insoles - What mistakes am I making,"https://imgur.com/a/1y0fWue/

Making heated insoles for ski boots as the $70 heated socks on Amazon are junk (barely produce heat). Plan is to use nichrome wire embedded in an insole to generate heat, powered by 2 18650s either strapped to my calf or sewn into a pocket of my ski pants.

Salvaged 18650s (2.5aH LG cells) and bought a few parts off of Amazon, controlled by PWM. 

Parts: 

 - [18 AWG Nichrome 80](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMYBIA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
 - [PWM controller](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PNBG3X2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
 - [18650 sleds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DF4ZFG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)
 - [18650s salvaged](https://secondlifestorage.com/showthread.php?tid=1938)

Super basic right now, 2 18650s in series, connects to a PWM controller and runs through about 2ft of 18awg Nichome 80. At 2.7A/2.7V (~7W) it maintains a wire temp of ~150F. I'm still experimenting with wire length to get optimal wattage without crazy hot wire.

I'm just a novice diy'er, what am I missing in this design that will come back to bite me? Currently under this load the PWM mosfet doesn't get hot, batteries are well under their current load, and PWM controller is well within spec from what I can tell. Am I missing something?

If there aren't any glaring problems with this setup, further plans:

 - make a 3d printed box
 - change the rotary pot to [trimpot](https://www.amazon.com/Trimpot-Variable-Resistor-Potentiometer-Assortment/dp/B071WW6VN8/ref=sr_1_14?keywords=10k+potentiometer&amp;qid=1582731354&amp;sr=8-14) (harder to accidentally bump it too hot)
 - add a 3way switch with a [TP4056](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Lithium-Charging-Protection-Functions/dp/B07PKND8KG/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=tp4056+type+c&amp;qid=1582731263&amp;sr=8-3) to charge the batteries (unless there's a solution to charge two batteries in series rather than individually?) Right now I just eject the batteries
 - Add a dual volt/amp meter so I know what wattage I'm using
 - Maybe upgrade the PWM controller to a smaller module

Also, there's a high frequency whine/buzz when the controller is functioning, I'm guessing that might be a cheap capacitor or something?

Once I'm done, each insole will only cost a few dollars to make.",20,1582731778,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/f9v3bn/diy_heated_insoles_what_mistakes_am_i_making/,DIY,1

f9ni0p,DoesntReallyLikeCats,Checking my understanding - How to add C-wires for smart thermostat install x3,"I'm in the process of installing some smart thermostats (Nest Thermostat E) to replace my old ones. I have a boiler radiator heating system with three zones. Two zones are straightforward heat only (main floor and basement). The third zone (upstairs) also controls AC and uses an air controller for forced air. The air actually blows over a radiator coil (I think this is the right term?) to supply the heat in this zone. In other words, there are no traditional radiators upstairs, just the forced air system blowing air over this radiator coil inside the ductwork.

I want to replace all three thermostats with Nests. None of the current thermostats are using a C wire. I understand it's not strictly necessary to have a C wire for the Nests, but they will function better if they have one. I'd like to wire them with C-wires and I think it's doable with my system. After studying up on all of this and researching what I have, I think I understand what I need to do, but I want to double-check and see if anyone can point out anything I'm overlooking or not understanding correctly.

**Background**

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/OCt5ZeZ) is the diagram I put together trying to map out how everything connects together in the current state. A few notes:

* Bottom left transformer, the boiler (controlled by [Hydrostat 3200-Plus](https://hydrolevel.com/fuel-smart-hydrostat-3200-plus3250-plus/)), and the three zone values are all in the basement.
* The bottom right transformer and the air controller unit are in an upstairs closet.
* ""Air Controller #1"" and ""Air Controller #2"" are both components that are located inside of my air controller unit. One seems to be controlled by the W1 wire from the thermostat, and the other from the G wire from the thermostat. So it seems like the W1 wire triggers the boiler as well as the air controller. I'm not sure why the G wire doesn't just power the air controller in the event of both calls for heating and cooling though?
* I didn't see any labels for the bottom right transformer, but I'm assuming what makes sense is that the red wiring coming off the transforming is the ""hot"" (R) and the green wire coming off is the ""neutral"" (C). That seems to make the rest of the diagram wiring make sense in my mind at least. FYI this transformer is a [Supco T45](https://www.supco.com/web/supco_live/products/T45.html).

**Adding C-wire**

I think what I need to do is:

1. For main floor and basement zones, make a connection between C coming off of the transformer (bottom left, where green wire meets the two orange wires) and an unused wire in both of the wires going to the main floor and basement thermostats. There are spare wires to be used in these.
2. For the upstairs zone, make a connection between the splice that joins the 5 wires (4 red, 1 green coming off the transformer) which is located in the air controller, and the thermostat. There's no extra wires available going to the thermostat, but it'll be easy to add something here since they are close. Again, looking for confirmation that this 5-wire splice is where my ""C wire"" should originate from.

Does this seem like the correct interpretation and approach to take?

**Other Questions**

* Should I worry about the number of items on a transformer? For example, the transformer in the basement (bottom left in diagram) is currently powering two zone valves. If it is also powering two Google Nest Thermostat E's, will that be too much? I can't find a VA rating on this thermostat, nor any model or labels at all other than the R and C terminals.
* In reading up on adding C-wires, I saw mention a few times of isolation relays (for example, [this thread](https://diy.stackexchange.com/questions/51999/wheres-the-c-terminal-on-my-boiler-control)). My interpretation is that these are necessary sometimes when you need to add an external transformer, and that they separate the circuit that is supplying the C wire to the thermostat from the circuit running within the boiler controller. I'm assuming I'm OK in my situation because the zone valves are ""isolating"" the circuits involving the external transformer (bottom left) from the circuit within the Hydrostat boiler controller.

Have a hairline crack in the grout in the corner of my shower.

Bought a tube of **MAPEI Keracaulk S** sanded caulking to hopefully fix it.  Only not sure if I should use it.

Can I just run a bead of it over the crack to cover it and seal it?

Do I need to actually remove the existing grout and redo it?

Should I use sanded or unsanded?

f9mv7m,pookeye,rinnai tankless + mini tank heater to solve wait time for hot water.,"I have a rinnai tankless water heater,   I'm in the process of remodeling my home, this is my first time using a tankless and I found out that tankless water heaters take a good 2 minutes to get hot,   which seems much longer than I want.   So I did some research and found the following  [https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-Electric-Mini-Tank-Heater-2-5-Gallon/dp/B0148O658Y?pf\_rd\_p=efbffffb-5fb9-462d-a69b-b368170a3995&amp;pd\_rd\_wg=t5nnM&amp;pf\_rd\_r=GZP9PV0JB3Z9KCVEHYG4&amp;ref\_=pd\_gw\_cr\_simh&amp;pd\_rd\_w=liGwP&amp;pd\_rd\_r=69051f9d-0ce3-460f-bdf4-3112b340d9d2](https://www.amazon.com/Bosch-Electric-Mini-Tank-Heater-2-5-Gallon/dp/B0148O658Y?pf_rd_p=efbffffb-5fb9-462d-a69b-b368170a3995&amp;pd_rd_wg=t5nnM&amp;pf_rd_r=GZP9PV0JB3Z9KCVEHYG4&amp;ref_=pd_gw_cr_simh&amp;pd_rd_w=liGwP&amp;pd_rd_r=69051f9d-0ce3-460f-bdf4-3112b340d9d2) 

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if adding this to my water system would work.

&amp;#x200B;

so the idea would be water main to tankless water heater,  then connect the hot water output to the 2.5 gallon tank above,   then that output goes to the rest of the house.   

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this would essentially fix my wait time for hot water,   but I cant seem to get a good answer to this,  (since the diagram in the above link seems to have a re circulation  pump)  i'm also wondering if i would have a cold water sandwich as well.",18,1582687724,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/f9mv7m/rinnai_tankless_mini_tank_heater_to_solve_wait/,DIY,1

f9l2q3,DaagTheDestroyer,"I built an industrial style blanket chest to give to my girlfriend on her birthday, and also included an engraving of a very important question.","I began working on the chest just before Christmas. I started by drawing up plans in AutoCAD and welded the steel frame. I machined the hinges on my lathe, and a friend of mine who works at a cabinet shop took on the responsibility of the walnut panels (I would've done it myself, but he offered to help and since I was on a time crunch and also working 12 hour days. I needed all the help i could get, also he didn't charge me anything for the lumber. Seriously one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.) My next door neighbor TIG welded some of the smaller parts that I was unable to do with my MIG welder. Another friend helped me out with the laser engraving. I used boiled linsead oil on the walnut and finished it only hours before I gave it to her. Yesterday I hired a pilot and took her on a private flight over a Zion National Park. In the meantime, my brother and a friend dropped off the chest at her house. After the flight and a dinner date at her favorite restaurant, I took her home and told her I made her something for her birthday. I turned on the light and walked her over to the chest and told her there was a note for her on the inside of the lid. she opened it and took a step back and looked at me with the biggest grin. I got on one knee and put a ring on her finger. I stood up and she said ""yes.""

f9l1sg,dynamanda,Diy tub replacement possible?,"Cross posted in home improvement 

We bought our home a few years ago and the master bath had a non-working jacuzzi tub. That was fine until the plastic of one of the Jets cracked and my bath water began leaking to ?? whatever surface is below the tub. (Slab foundation, one story home.) Around the time this happened we had a new baby and we were just exhausted with life so the easiest solution was I'd just take showers from now on. The tub hasn't been used in two years. I nerve noticed any water damage but I wouldn't know where I would be able to notice it anyway because the bathroom is the farthest corner of the house on an outside wall. So where would I see damage? 
 
 I want to buy a new tub from Lowe's and have it delivered. I want my husband and his two brothers to remove the old tub and install the new one. One brother is a skilled maintenance man for a large apartment complex and can fix just about anything. Other brother is skilled as well, with a perfectionist streak. We plan on staying in the house only another 2 years or so, and then selling. I want a working tub for as little $ as possible. 

My experience with diy jobs is that they always end up being more money and work than you expect. Is this a job that 3 capable men can do? What's the worst possible scenario lurking under the existing tub?  What should I prepare myself for? Here's a pic of the tub and surrounding cultured marble things around it.
