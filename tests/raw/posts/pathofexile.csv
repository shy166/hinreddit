fso7ch,Zivole,Can we talk about reflect mechanics?,"With reflect being a wall many builds, including mine, cannot overcome, I think clearing up the mechanics would be beneficial for the community. I was a bit surprised when i died to reflected damage even with 100% reduction, so I decided to have a look at it. 

More specifically; what modifiers require the player to have more than 100% reduction of reflected damage to be safe. According to the wiki, modifiers that increase damage taken works additively with reduced reflected damage.
In other words, with the abyssus used as an example one would need 140-150% reduced reflected physical damage to be safe from physical reflected damage.


Sources of increased damage taken that I currently know of:


Abyssus: increases physical damage taken

Curses: elemental weakness, vulnerability, etc.

Sextants: x additional packs that deal cold/fire/

lightning/physical damage - players and monsters take x% increased cold/fire/lightning/physical damage


I assume shock/shocking ground also requires a higher investment in reflect reduction to achieve safety. 

If anyone knows of other modifiers to be aware of it would be nice of you to comment with them!",3,1585698294,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fso7ch/can_we_talk_about_reflect_mechanics/,pathofexile,0

fsmsd6,TallDann,Does Plaguebringer seem awkwardly designed to anyone else? [Discussion],"I am late to the party on playing a summoner build (MIA four leagues), but I noticed that the Necromancer's Plaguebringer node feels really clunky to get the most out of it. You are encouraged to

a) cast offerings frequently

but also

b) have unconsumed corpses around

Essence Glutton is the same deal. How are you expected to both be casting offerings but still have corpses around when offering eats every single corpse desecrate puts down? I understand you could manual cast desecrate, but this tends to be prohibitively slow (and in delirium, dangerous) to do, or link desecrate to a support to double the corpses, but gem slots on a summoner already tend to be extremely tight.

It just feels like as designed, two of the nodes in the Necromancer class are really hard to get the full potential out of. Shouldn't there be something in the necromancer tree that increases corpse production via desecrate? Or increases duration of offerings while decreasing the number of corpses they consume? I understand there is a lab enchant, but at this point with what like, 300 helm enchants? It just isn't viable to farm for that in SSF, or even really in trade league when you are playing off meta builds since people aren't going to be spamming enchants on diadems. Just feels like some small changes would make it way most consistent of an ascendancy class. 

Note: a lot of this pertains mostly to bosses, as corpses during mapping are way easier to get obviously.",9,1585693427,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsmsd6/does_plaguebringer_seem_awkwardly_designed_to/,pathofexile,2

The exploding heat seeking missiles were quite OP but that's all been fixed and honestly all you had to do was not walk over the shinny sacks on the ground (which were easy to see). The league is even better now and rates up there with Legion to me.           
        
- Yes, there is A LOT to do in the game but that's our fault for all the posts toward the end of the league begging GGG to make ""insert league content"" core. They are just listening to us.                
       
- I have zero problem with the mid-league nerf. It was the most powerful build EVER in the game, it was unintended, and if you're a veteran player you know that GGG has been trying to limit the role of HH without gutting it because it's such a unique chase item. STOP ABUSING IT SO WE CAN HAVE NICE THINGS!          
        
- I personally like trading and understand the time sink vs reward philosophy. It was the same way in Diablo 2 LOD. Instantaneous auction houses do not work in these types of games because most of the loot is not gated behind timed events like in MMO's.        
       
- You don't have to play the game fast if you don't want to. Exalts and valuable items drop at a pretty decent rate. You can fully gear 1 or 2 characters a league by playing at your own pace AND if you do play slower the visual clarity is drastically improved.      
       
This communities attitude since Betrayal/Synthesis is the real problem. Some of you spend more time on here than actually playing the game. If you no longer enjoy the game for some reason then take a break and play something else then come back and try again in 6 months to a year.         
           
The real problem with the game is the amount of bots flipping currency. It is inevitable for a game this size and nature not to have bots like this as it happens in ever game I've ever played with a living breathing economy. I don't know to solve this correctly but I'm sure the GGG is throwing everything they have at it.",36,1585691295,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsm478/am_i_the_only_one_who_doesnt_have_major/,pathofexile,0

fsle2u,HepNuk,GGG Replenishing Presence Nerf goes against your general philosophy.,"I might be a minority here but i definitely think the upcoming nerf to the ""Replenishing Presence"" Notable which reads as follows  :   
Auras from your Skills grant 0.2% of Life Regenerated per second to you and Allies, 8% increased effect of Non-Curse Auras from your Skills

The nerf consists of halving the regen this node gives to 0.1%. -"" [https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2815906](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2815906) ""

I think this nerf goes completely against their philosophy of nerfing or changing stuff mid league that are not actually unintended mechanics or bugs. They told us Purposeful harbinger would not be nerfed and that we should enjoy it this league. They did fix the unintended interactions it was having with other ""non skill auras"" such as Tailwind, HH Buffs and Shaper's Presence which is fine and it never should have worked like that from the beginning. This is all fine and deserved.

However, what I find irritating and stupid is nerfing a node that A LOT more than just some herald stacking builds were using (namely guardian which was already nerfed due to the fix to how the node worked)  the nod being you guessed it Replenishing Presence. I think it is completely unfair to nerf other builds that have decided to invest and build around the capability to use this node to its fullest such as Aura bots and other builds that were stacking 2-3 auras and were planning around getting that node for some nice Regen. BUT purposeful is left at full power (minus the fix). 

They will be having the regen of many builds who chose to use that node just for the sole purpose that some herald builds were abusing it too. Why couldn't the the Purposeful harbinger itself (the bigger problem) be slightly nerfed (lets say 8%) instead of a node that other builds were using. 

After this Herald stacking builds will still be of the most (if not the most) broken build ever while other builds suffer for a node that only some herald stacking builds use.

On a small of how this could affect some builds, as an aura bot i decided to skip out on skyforth (which gives 6% reduced mana reserved) and chose to spend a lot of time and effort getting enough reduced reservation to not run those boots, SIMPLY because they read You have no Life Regen. so that i could benefit from this node. I could have a much easier time getting wicked ward and putting on skyforth and stacking faster es start but instead i chose to use a harder to process to build around a node that will be nerfed MID LEAGUE, because of another build that is broken.

TL;DR - Nerfing Replenishing Presence is unfair to every other build that has built around it to use its power because of another build that should have been nerfed instead DIRECTLY ant not indirectly (which in the end wont matter for that build).",22,1585688961,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsle2u/ggg_replenishing_presence_nerf_goes_against_your/,pathofexile,8
fsl9q9,Spr09,"Having everything gated behind t14+ maps makes the endgame impossible to access if RNG is bad. I wasn't annoyed before, but the atlas is absolutely awful this league.","The title says it and I just need to let a built up rant out.

How were these changes supposed to help this league when done together?

* Atlas missions as rewards are tied to awakening objectives, which can only be completed by running t14+ maps
* Lower-tier maps than how many are required no longer spawn conquerors, which takes away usefulness of white+yellow maps if you have defeated conquerors 4 or more times.

I'm sorry, but this combination is god awful and at least one of them needs to be reverted back. I have 113 awakening objectives so far and in 30 (yes I counted) t11-t13 maps I got 0 red map drops and 3 missions total, 2 Niko and 1 Einhar, neither of which help me complete atlas content, which I thought was supposed to be the gateway to nearly all endgame content.

Not having t14+ maps means the following:

* Zana does not sell maps that are at or above t14
* Zana missions (If you happen to get them) can only have t14 maps in t13 if you have them, t15&amp;16 will not spawn, including any unique maps and shaper/elder boss influence maps.
* Shaper and Elder bosses are completely gated, no influenced maps are available unless Zana is selling, meaning ALL influenced items are gated unless they drop from delve/incubators/delirium.
* Conquerors will not influence regions or spawn if you have hit the point of needing 4 watchstones.
* More maps will not drop of similar tier.

I've hit the point of now not being blocked by difficulty, every single map I run is rare and very often corrupted for extra IIQ/R and I get nothing. How is this fucking fun? How is this okay? Literally all of the higher-difficulty endgame content is gated from me and it's beyond my control outside of trading which is an awful and expensive experience. I physically cannot obtain items needed to strengthen my build any further, I cannot fight any harder bosses, I can't get any more watchstones, I can't do level 83 temple or safehouses, I will never see elder or shaper, and I cannot fight even begin to access Sirus.

Fuck this atlas and there's no point to running it for me now unless map drops change. If it's this RNG gated and everything requires access to the top 3 tiers of maps that I simply cannot acquire, then there's no point in playing.

fsksd8,self_mad,(Insert qualifier) opinion: I like masters not spawning naturally,"I believe I'm affected by the ""no natural spawn"" bug (at least in more than hundred of maps I think I never saw a natural master spawn). And so far I think it has improved my game experience quite a bit. 

First, it prevents annoying things like surprise Betrayal inquisition popping into deliriumed breach, which is not something my old laptop can handle very well. If I want that sudden risk spike, I'll take some precautions (e.g. if I think I can handle Delirium or Betrayal, but not both, I'll simply opt out of Delirium on Betrayal-ed maps) 

Secondly, it creates more incentive to kill bosses, which in my opinion is great. Now, it admittedly creates a perverse incentive to chain multiple lower-tier maps to get easy access to masters, but since there's an opportunity cost attached to that (i.e. not running higher tier maps for better xp and loot) I don't think it's too bad.

Thirdly, it brings the idea of player agency further. If I don't want to bother with incursions right now, I'm going to simply ignore that they exist. If at some point I want/need some temple content, I'll simply chain Alva quests. Or, if I need to find the pesky remaining labyrinth trials, I'm gonna chain Zana for the ""Solve Labyrinth trial"" quests. With Alva specifically this is especially great, since you get a better control over your temple level.

Now, I agree that insofar as it simply reduces amount of master encounters you get it's an unwelcome nerf. But that can be fixed by tweaking the chance to get a mission for completing a map.

Overall, I have a conspiratorial hope that GGG is running an experiment with control group to see if getting rid of natural spawns is a viable idea, and this post is a data-point I wanted to share.",2,1585687067,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsksd8/insert_qualifier_opinion_i_like_masters_not/,pathofexile,0

I’ve gone through like 3 chapters without changing a thing because the gear I find in the field just has too little gem links and don’t match. Mind you I have very little orbs of fusing, chromatic, or—anything. 

2. Around what level should be doing my ascension trials? 

3. How do I find better flasks at my level, or is that even necessary? 

That should do it. Thanks guys!

fskf72,procrastination_,Suggestions to make Sirus not bullshit,"Here are my suggestions/opinions, bad or good:  

1. Put a cooldown on the meteor teleport to stop the teleport into storm bullshit  
2. Trigger the voice lines when the apparition does something. I like playing up close builds and having to focus on Sirus on the edge of the ring only to get off screened by the apparition is not good fucking design. At least if i can hear that the whole arena is about to get degen zones or be blown up by that rain of stars, I can react.  
3. I got 4x beamed by Sirus after entering the arena, but not while inside his ring. Another offscreen that i couldn't react to because there was a storm blocking every escape route. So my suggestion here is to disable Sirus' (not his apparition's) skills while the player is not inside his ring.  

I understand that you wanted to make the fight harderbut dying to Sirus feels like encountering a bug, not being 'outplayed'. I can't do anything about being teleported into a storm or being offscreened with no cues and no escape. For example, if i die to shaper slam I ran too early and thought I was safe or I reacted too late and I can learn and adjust my strategy.   

So please GGG, make Sirus a challenge, not a QA test/bug report.",1,1585685919,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fskf72/suggestions_to_make_sirus_not_bullshit/,pathofexile,0

fsk2oo,Bongmasta666,Fog Mechanic is just Bad,"While running a graveyard map today the mirror happend to spawn just outside the arena. The reward was divination cards and I had the option to chase the fog around or go fight the bosses. The intuitive thing would be to go and fight the several bosses while under the fog since getting to the arena is essentially the goal. So that's what I did. After finishing this multiphase battle the fog had dissapeared and the rewards had stacked up. A whopping /2/! The sum of rewards was 2 uselss div cards and 1 simi shard. 

The trailer showed tweaked out bosses and talked about how we'd be chasing this fog down choosing when to turn back when danger got to substantial. There's even a challenge to beat 500 bosses while in the fog. But going to fight a boss in the map is the last thing you want to do and once you've reached you're third /5/3/1/ in any map it's impossible to chase the fog anymore.

So this is just a personal opinion, but this fog nonsense is just dumb. Damage scaling was never really an issue, and the volatiles having changed is nice but never really bothered me too much. What bothers me is this back asswards counter intuitive design. Let alone the terrible performance issues and the fact it's pretty much a rehash league. 

That all aside. Metamorph was true perfection and I hope too see more of that design in the future.",1,1585684861,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsk2oo/fog_mechanic_is_just_bad/,pathofexile,0

fsjona,UberSquirrel,"I know some thing are frustrating, but....","The way some of you people are expressing your concerns with the game on this subreddit is genuinely baffling. I get it, there's a bunch of stuff bothering me, too, like the performance issues (I've crashed out of my Simulacrum more times than I care to recall) and the absolute state that is the trade API.

But take a moment and think. The devs are working from home right now - they've already announced this does hamper development and asked for your patience as they sort things out. If you honestly think they are unaware of the issues, I don't know what to tell you. If they don't get fixed, it's not because there hasn't been another whiny-ass Reddit thread pointing it out, it's because either the problem's origins are unknown or hard to fix, or (in the case of the lack of a better way to trade items) because changing it goes against core game philosophy.

So, please, feel free to be critical, or to come up with an interesting point when considering the percieved shortcomings of the game or the league - we already know GGG does take those into account quite seriously.

fsjffj,errant,Idea to Partially Solve Trading Issues Related to Price Fixing,"Price fixing plagues almost every item and wastes player's time. However, this only works because, ethics aside, there is nothing stopping players from listing items for sale which they have no intent to sell. To stop this, GGG could charge a 'listing fee' in-game without a need for an auction house. 


For example, you want to list an item for 100c. To list it for sale you pay 3c to list the item (if 3%). If you delist + relist, you have to pay again. Price fixers would be much less willing if doing so would eat into their profit margins. This would also reduce the load on the auction house because people would think twice before making uninformed listings. Additionally, it would also double as a deflationary mechanism as currency is continuously being removed from the market, which helps counterbalance the inflationary nature of league play.

fsi089,tempolamp9,"Arakaalis fang with zombies, finally found a spell that kills the worms 100% of the time!!!","I assume that everyone reading this knows about the headache of summoning spiders while having other minions around before they kill them first so I wont get into that. Also, this is not about having spiders up while mapping with Speakers Wreath, this is about summoning spiders with no enemies around, and besides that extra ""minions can only kill ignited enemies"", Speakers Wreath sucks for summoners.

I have tried all the spells in the game: Orb of Storms, Cyclone + infused channeling + increased area of effect + desecrate, rain of fire etc etc. They work sometimes, but its not 100%. I think its because the aoe is too small. The the worms always fly out in random directions so you might miss them with a smaller aoe, or maybe the attack speed of the skills/spells are too slow and your other minions are faster. Also, when you are in combat and needs to summon spiders FAST you dont want to try to get in the exact right position and get the perfect timing for whatever spell (and in combat you usually have a bunch of corpses around so u dont need desecrate).

Anyway, the one spell that ALWAYS kills the worms before your minions is Divine Ire. Put down the desecrates, channel divine ire and use ur flask. It does not matter if your zombies are standing on top of you and all around, divine ire will still be faster.

fshukf,Soepoelse123,Spawn time on delirium mobs.,"Toucan gods hear my prayers.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive recently made (the mistake of creating) a cyclone character, and melee feels kinda bad with delirium encounters (not the delirious maps or simulacrum), as the mobs only spawn once youre on top of the spawning baubles. That leads me to have a fairly long tail of juicy delirium monsters following me, that i know in my heart i cannot kill due to them exploding on me (and backtracking or whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

My best idea to solve this issue with relative ease, is to make the spawn area bigger so as to spawn them before you get to them, or just drop the entire mist spawn animation (or just greatly speed it up). Because the problem isnt that they explode IMO, but rather that they force you to kill them at range or backtrack into their explosions.

&amp;#x200B;

fshp9v,ImmaculateEjaculatio,Mana reservation bug?,"EDIT3: False alarm, I'm an idiot and forgot to take off essence worm since I was still transitioning my gear and skills. Please feel free to laugh at me. 

I've respeced into a guardian herald build because I wanna try it before it get nerfed - I'm more or less done with the league anyway and stayed away from it till now but might as well check what all the hype is about before I head off. I'm following the ""immortal man"" build with every herald, every purity aura, etc. Something seems wrong though. I have 2 heraldry passive nodes allocated and every single ""reduced mana"" passive node on the tree, as well as a conqueror's efficiency jewel in there, but my heralds are still reserving 20%. Shouldn't that be way lower? if Heraldry reduced it by 10%, that would be 2.5% per node, so it seems like Im only getting the 5% reduction from both heraldry nodes and nothing else? Am I missing something or is this bug? Anyone else had this issue? I was told that 2 heraldry nodes is all I'd need to fit in all the auras assuming Im using an Alpha's Howl and all passive nodes with reduced mana reservation on the tree, but as it is I can barely fit in all the heralds plus 2 or 3 big auras, never mind all the purity auras, etc.

EDIT: Can also confirm that wrath is taking 50% still and Discipline 35% since heraldry does not affect them so it seems like none of my mana reservation passives are having any effect. If I equip an Alphas Howl it does have an effect so it seems to be an issue with the passives only.

I got helped by a friend who knows the game much better than me to gear it all up, i have almost everything you see in this video except like helm with 1 additional projectile from ice spear , but the class just looks underwhelming af: waveclear is really fine, but considering how squishy it feels i would expect more tbh ; also i really really struggle against bosses (like conquerors with 4 gems or tier 14-15-16), ice spear fails to hit if they move just by an inch and the damage is far from being good anyways. Maybe i have big expectations because basically every class i see on youtube oneshots everything, even bosses. My friend claims ""my class i super squishy so i do huge damage"" , but my actual class feels both squishy and low in damage, only waveclear is fine. The last chance i want to give it is by buying the helm with 1 additional ice spear projectile so, my questions would be :  


  
How does this additional projectile work? It 's like a completely new flow of spears or is it just 1 more hit amongst the other 10000 fired from the totems? Do you guys think it would be a huge upgrade?  


  
Should i change class? This one is okish (fun-wise) but i really gotta be supercareful,cast totems before i enter any room, waiting for them to clear, then go on and repeat, making it super slow, since damage is not superb and survivability is even worse. If you think i should change class/build, what would you recommend to me? I like some melee stuff like marauder (seeing youtube) but i fear i would die even more because i melee everything while spinning.  


Sorry if this post looks like a huge complaint and if it may just be my low skill at this game, but youtube maybe pumped my standards , as everyone just walks and everything nearby dies.

It helps to have a linear/open field layout and the ability to also kill the boss for some extra splinters. (Strand, Promenade, Jungle Valley, Tropical Island, Beach etc.)

Go AGAINST the mist direction at first, reach the border of the map and start zigzaging from there along with the mist's direction while stepping on as much things as you can.

Path of Gems is pretty simple really: it accepts a Path of Building URL, it downloads the build, decompresses, fetches some gem/vendor/quest data and then displays it on a timeline. All on your browser! 🔥

Each section corresponds to a level, so you know when you can use the gem and where to get it.

You can toggle which gem you already have and your build is saved for when you come back.

fsfwk9,ProfessorNox,"[Information] Spellslinger + Cold Snap is amazing, and Spellslinger Cold Snap + Poet's Pen is sick.","I figured I'd share in case it wasn't widespread knowledge yet, but the cooldown that Spellslinger puts on the linked spell is usually a hard ceiling on its power. Because that's a technical limitation of the Spellslinger skill, it's difficult to push to insane levels. It's feasible, definitely, but it requires a lot of CDR investment which can be daunting and/or costly.  
  
  The cooldown Spellslinger applies is _on the skill itself_. As such, while you can't Spellsling Frostbolts faster than the Spellslinger cooldown, Cold Snap has always let you bypass its cooldown by consuming Frenzy charges, or Power charges if you have [Winter's Bounty](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Winter%27s_Bounty).  
  
  Yep. That means you _can_ spam Cold Snap at the same pace you attack with your wand. Contrary to my initial intuition, scaling damage on Spellslinger alone with an _extremely high damage_ Physical DPS Wand is worse than using Poet's Pen on top of Spellslinger, especially since you can add Wave of Conviction for Cold Exposure application.
  
  I'm bringing this up because it seems like there have been a few conversations around making Spellslinger work with something like Poet's Pen, and Cold Snap seems a good solution. You can use Poet's Pen to trigger spells like Wave of Conviction / Blade Vortex, all the while getting Spellslinger to quite literally _spam_ Cold Snap all over the place at the pace that you attack.  
  
  There's also a corner case of multiple Cold Snaps being cast simultaneously from Spellslinger, or by having another Cold Snap in Poet's Pen, etc, which I haven't looked into. I think a properly built character with a 15% Spellslinger Mana Reservation enchant could maybe even stack multiple Cold Snaps at once for some absolutely idiotic damage output, provided a sufficient amount of Power Charge generation.  
  
  The trick is also finding a way to make your wand attack efficient to make Spellslinger trigger as much as possible. My favorite way to do that currently is to use [The Hungry Loop](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/The_Hungry_Loop), socketed with Kinetic Blast (or Power Siphon!), having consumed:  
- Faster Attacks  
- Power Charge on Critical Strike  
- Ice Bite (for Frenzy charge generation &amp; Freeze, if you need it)  
- Increased Critical Strikes _or_ alternatively just raw damage increase with Elemental Attacks/Focus,etc.  
  
  I'm pretty socket-hungry right now since I'm scaling damage off of the general Harbinger shenanigans, but for what it's worth the effective DPS of the build without _any_ of current Aura abuses (Cane, Solstice, Headhunter, Vaal Auras, Tailwind) etc. is in the 15-20M baseline. Once you factor in Vaal Haste &amp; Tailwind alone, the build skyrockets in the 40M range of DPS, and gets even more absurd once you enable Vaal Righteous Fire/Vaal Cold Snap/Vaal Blade Vortex, pushing into the 70-80M range. PoB doesn't do a great job of accounting for the automatic casts from Spellslinger as it calculates skill damage from your natural cast speed rather than your attack speed.  
  
   Even without _any_ of the Harbinger scaling, I'm sure there's a way to push this combination into insanity, but I'll need to work on that later. So Poet's Pen degenerates unite, it's time!  
    
  I'd also like to mention that [Skyforth](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Skyforth) provides a solid Power Charge generation mechanism, paired with great mana reservation for the Spellslinger links (and other Auras you might have). Obviously, Assassins or the corresponding Ascendancy from Scion provides a baseline Power Charge on Crit that's _extremely_ relevant, as you no longer need to worry about that aspect on the gearing side and can focus on other stuff.  
  
  And while we're at it, might as well mention the [Precursor's Emblems](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Precursor%27s_Emblem) that can provide ""#% chance that if you would gain Power Charges, you instead gain up to your maximum number of Power Charges""     
  
  So yeah.

fsfw58,99_in_eating,I would love to have a Sandbox PoE,"As a relatively inexperienced player, I am often overwhelmed by the complexity of the game. Path of Building is an awesome tool to theory craft and see potential effects of changing a certain piece of gear or changing passives and I'd like to thank everyone involved with the project. 

However, to truly know if a build will be good or bad is a big challenge for me. Even if PoB gives me all the numbers, it is hard for me to truly understand what they mean. There is no way to know if a build ""feels"" right. It helps a lot when optimizing a build that is known to be viable but not when trying to design an entirely new thing (not for me, at least). 

I feel there is so many builds I would like to try but decide not too because it would be too much of a time investment (leveling the new character + all the time spent trading, which we know can be painful) to try something that might not even be fun to play.

I don't know if the idea was ever brought up but, what I would absolutely love to see is some sort of ""Sandbox league"". In this ""Sandbox league"" your character only has access to the hideout and map device. You can set the character level (with some command) and spawn items with some UI or command (i.e.: you could copy the data for an existing item and submit a command have it spawn). This would allow players to experiment with builds that they would otherwise never try because of aforementioned reasons. Obviously, this ""Sandbox league"" could be time-constrained, meaning it is only available for a few days at a time and comes back every so often. Once the ""Sandbox league"" is over, all characters from it are deleted permanently.

In this ""Sandbox league"", it could be an idea to also allow players to acquire mtx for free to preview different sets and allow them to try to mix and match different pieces to see how well they fit together, thus increasing potential revenue stream of MTX.

Another reason to have such a feature implemented is... testing. As much as GGG wants to be able to test everything, there is so much elements here that it would be practically impossible for them. However, a mass of players messing around in this ""Sandbox league"" could help identify bugs more rapidly (stuff like overpowered builds that require nerfing mid-league, new items/skills/passives that don't behave as intended, broken MTX, etc..). You know, the kind of things that never happens.. \*wink\*.

The idea is implemented in Old School Runescape and is known as ""Unrestricted worlds"". 

TL;DR: would love OSRS's equivalent of ""Unrestricted worlds"" in PoE.

fsfjes,hatwarrior,"GGG should allow Guardian's ""Radiant Faith"" to be counted as an aura from your skills for the remainder of the league","Last league, many Guardians were using the ""auras on you"" chest and the [Whakatutuki o Matua](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Whakatutuki_o_Matua) shield to scale their Radiant Faith aura and despite asking in the mechanics thread multiple times whether or not this was intended, there was never any clarification. Even this [guide](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2663126) with over 300 pages of responses suggested using it for aura effect multiple leagues before Delirium.

At this point it had become common belief that this was not a bug at all and intended. Nobody building their Guardians around Purposeful Harbinger saw this as a bug, but rather a powerful interaction. With the new change, these already existing builds will have their ES halved, or in some cases cut to a third of what they had before because of lack of clarification from GGG.

It's completely understandable that the items granting buffs were removed, but unlike items, people can't just equip another ascendancy or passive tree. This build is already nerfed heavily with the new changes and will not clear at HH speeds or outregen Sirus storms anymore, so I think it would be reasonable to have Radiant Faith function as an aura for the remainder of Delirium because it's a permanent aura which functions nearly identical to skill auras.

fsffm6,kufra,"Mechanics and game ""difficulty"", why do we play PoE?","After last week drama about the herald build it got me thinking.

Why are we complaining that the build is too broken? What is actually the problem with the build being unbalanced? Why do we enjoy the game?

I think my view on this may differ from the broader audience, but I would like to post about it anyway. 


I play this game mostly for the character development. By this I mean the sense of progression, with increase in character power you are able to do higher tier content. And when at the ""highest"" content level you start to improve the speed at which you can clear, or the safety in the way you clear. All this is connected to the power of the character.

This game is extremely good in this regard. We have lots of mechanics to scale the character, complex itemization system with hard to achieve top end and content where we can benchmark our characters.

So when it comes to game difficulty, it's for me a matter of, can I do this content without dying? Can I do it faster? I want the content to be a mix of gameplay and build power, but actually mainly build power. I do not want PoE to be dark souls. 


I also do not see an issue with content being trivialized by character power. I see lots of comments with complaints about different builds trivializing content and I mostly do not agree to this. I want builds to be able to scale into the level of trivializing all content in game, but I want the way to get there to be a long grind. Let me stress this point cause it's the most important part of this post. I want characters to be able to progress such that content becomes trivial.

We actually have this in the game already. Every patch have had different builds trivializing content and farming maps/bosses, often times involving headhunter.


In history of PoE we have had some really fun builds or mechanics, chase builds if you like. So let me just list a few of my favourites:

* ShatterChuck, CoC without cooldown and projectiles that shotgunned
* Lowlife aura snapshotting
* Vaal pact instant life leech
* AFK uberelder RF build
* Wormblasters yes all of them!!

There are more but just to name a few.


So why bring all this history up? 

I'm very disappointed in the nerf to the herald stacking build this league (coming up). Every day, someone found a new ""aura"" that could be scaled. Players invested exalts, even mirrors into this build to make the most out of it. And as I just explained, this is a good thing in my point of view. Some leagues it's more easy to play the best builds some leagues it's hard. This time, it was easy to achieve the basics with maybe a few exalted and some time, but to go all in you still need to heavily invest, which means farming. 


So, why nerf? I hear the argument that rich people use the build to trivialize content and farm more Currency.

This has always been the case. Headhunter have existed for several years and has been abused by the wealthy players for a very long time farming juiced up content. 

And the argument about trivializing content, well read this post :)


I was looking forward to chase after this build myself. The whole build became a big chase build, solstice vigil, voices, tailwind boots, good unset rings with chaos resist. Some gear that is usually shit became the best.

As I said, every day someone posted new ways of abusing the aura scaling. Empyrean even outregen the sirus clouds after investing 3 mirrors(?). Great! 


Is it only me? Am I alone in paying this game with the main enjoyment of playing with mechanics to try to trivialize the content?",57,1585670232,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsffm6/mechanics_and_game_difficulty_why_do_we_play_poe/,pathofexile,10

fsfcjd,lddiamond,"I hate to say it, but I've quit the game I loved for the last 5+ years. I don't regret the money I spent here though. I'll only be back if major issues are address.","It seems every league they move further and further ahead while ignoring issues that get worse and worse. 

Trade is the number one issue, it quite simply is the biggest hold back to this game and becomes worse the more people play the game. I'm not going to beat a dead horse here, as it's all been said numerous times. But you know trade is bad when you are happy you find a bot to trade with. 

League mechanic bloat: Quite simply stop adding everything to the core, cycle some out for a time, with everything added to the core many interactions conflict with others.

Timed League mechanics: It makes interacting with others for trade or whatever next to impossible if you want to do the mechanic. So many times I get messaged a question or trade and I don't have time to respond because I'm too busy trying to get as much done with the timer counting down.

Game engine performance: It's gotten worse, and a lot worse. I'm lucky I got a high end system but I remember playing this game on a 550ti back when it released, while it wasn't perfect I managed to enjoy it. Now people are having trouble with set ups 3x stronger than what I originally played with. I understand its 2020 and people should have stronger systems, but not every long term player can afford to upgrade their systems that often and they are getting ignored or insulted because they haven't upgraded their system. 

Global Chat: Its a toxic mess. I have turned it off for leagues now, and it feels like its a part of the game I miss, having people who used to be helpful in chat. 

Well I'll leave it there for now. I'm icing this until POE 2 and hope a lot of these issues are address. 

I fully expect to be downvoted to oblivion or have some other toxic response to this post. You don't have to agree with me, but please don't insult me just because I feel this way, feel free to voice your counter argument. 

Also the game is still growing at a fast pace for new players each league, so I know me leaving means nothing at the end of the day. GGG will only be forced to re-evaluate some of their ideas when a critical mass starts leaving. 

Anyways I'll end by saying thank you GGG for the amazing game, I don't regret supporting you over the years, I hope I do find it worth while to come back at a later time.",286,1585669955,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsfcjd/i_hate_to_say_it_but_ive_quit_the_game_i_loved/,pathofexile,5

The performance is so bad, I can't play the game, I really can't. I takes 5 minutes to get into the hideout, another 5 minutes to load every texture, item, aura, particle and all that, another 5 minutes to get into a map and wait for everything to load, and after that the first second a moster moves or I cast a spell or I do anything, the game goes to 0 fps and then goes back to 60 fps. The stuttering gets so bad, the game actually crashed, and it takes another 15 minutes to get back into the map. It's a pain, but somehow I still love the game and I try to play every single day for a few hours until I get tired of fps drops, lag spikes, stuttering and crashes.

I tried every possible fix I could find to fix my issue. I was thinking my rig wasn't good enough, because I expect it not being it able to run at ultra settings, but it should be at least have some constant 30 fps. I tried disabling things in the windows registry, cleaning, uninstalling and reinstalling, switching from steam to standalone, nothing would make the game enjoyable, but I'm still somehow playing it. 

Also, the trading site is a complet mess. It takes forever to load, after you have to click the search button 1000 times.

I'm a newer player, started playing at the end of 3.8 (played BL Miner), missed a good chunk of 3.9 (played baron necro) and am just now able to start this league. I know I'm a little late to the start, but I just figured I'd throw a quick question to the masses. I've read that Delirium is pretty rippy, but they may have been patched now. I have been able to read up on a few builds and think I've narrowed it down to what might be good. It seems that a well rounded build is recommended since boss HP/defenses can get bumped in the higher tiers, as well as their damage. I have a friend who stated they could donate me a Tabula Rasa and about 5 chaos. They just got done with act 10 and is starting maps. in the past two leagues combined, I have yet to earn enough currency to have an exalted orb, so keep that in mind. I was looking at these, but don't know which may be the best...or start out decently enough and be able to scale well with investment:

1) Storm Brand Heirophant using new archmage support (looks well rounded)

2) Poison Blade Vortex build (looks fun, maybe a little weak on defenses, but speed/poison makes up for that)

3) Wallach's Freezing Pulse Totems (seems underrated, but watched a full simulacrum deathless run)

4) Bleed Lacerate

5) Bleed Bow

6) Cyclone Impale Champion

If the problem is how easy you can get purposeful harbinger jewels (not the heraldry or endbringer ones, just purposeful harbinger), well, at least you need some investment to play the build, and you need to level up as something else, since the tree sucks for leveling, while for necromancer you could literally league start it and scale as you go

Necromancer also could clear maps really fast, maybe not to the same extent, but it was one of best non-headhunter clear builds

fse40u,VulpineKitsune,Why is friction needed for items to keep their value? The items have rarity and we have crafting.,"I've seen this repeated again and again and again and it never made sense to me.

""Friction is an important aspect of the game's economy, without it items would have no value""

No value? What in the universe are they talking about. The value of the chaos orb doesn't come from how annoying it is to trade an exalt for it. It comes from what you can do with it. In leagues where people use chaos orbs more (ex, better zana mods, chaos spamming being worth it etc...) the value of the chaos orb rise. In leagues lacking those things, the value of the chaos orb falls.

Same thing applies to Exalted orbs. They have a basic high value based on the fact that they are rare. Their exact value varies depending on how useful they are and how valuable chaos orbs are. 

I do not understand how those values would change if the transactions were to be automated in some way.

fsdp2k,Optimal_Version,Do these Blighted maps normally give so much loot??,"So, I'm level 84 Arc Witch - this is my first real season, actually getting to maps and endgame. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ran my first actual Temple incursion today (watched tutorial on how those work and killed Omnitech).

&amp;#x200B;

I then had a T2 White Blighted map - which I used an Alch on to make it gold.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy cow! I've done the Blight ""sidequests"" before - but this was absolutely insane. I managed to survive the entire 5 minutes (still not sure what I'm doing, but I spam build all the towers and just try to kill everything?) and at the end, my entire bottom ""rewards"" bar was filled.. I easily had over 30 ""blight cysts"" to open! 

&amp;#x200B;

This is absolutely insane - my entire screen multiple times over was filled with insane loot - even with the strict filter. Is this normal for blighted maps? Did I just happen to get lucky with this one instance?

fsdp06,zheavy,Sirus fight Broken mechanic or intended?!,"So I've just done A8 Sirus for the first time, i lost all portals on \~15%, I have a decent build cyclone impale 6k+ life and \~3-4M DPS.

I managed to understand the entire fight as I've done him a couple of times on A5 and A7, but I always have trouble in the last phase when he says ""Die""

I'm not sure if this is broken or intended and i'm just not understanding on how to dodge it.

What is basically happening, after he spawns the 10+ clones in the air and they all shoot at me, he teleports back and instantly does the ""die"" mechanic, i can mostly dodge it with whirling blades, but sometimes he teleports in front of me - OFF SCREEN - and instead of using my whirling blades around the edge of the circle as i usually do, i'm finding myself running towards the beam because i CANT see where he is, i tried also running towards the center but to my luck he was sitting opposed to me so how am i supposed to dodge this?!

  
This also happened when i walk back in to the arena and he off screens me before i enter the circle, i always try to run zigzag to the arena due to this happening a couple of times to me but sometimes it's just unavoidable and the clouds are too cluttered together and there is no delay from when he yells out ""Die"" to the actually beams shooting out.

&amp;#x200B;

fsd5id,asdanjer,"Wey nurfing "" Purposeful Harbinger "" is a huge mistake","Is the build to strong? Yes, but does is break anything? no

Is there massive lag, resulting in a problem for servers? no

Does it make you immune to damage or even any specific kind of damage? no

Does it deal unparalleled amounts of damage? no. It does a lot, but not more than other good and expensive builds.

It does break absolutely NOTHING. it only uses an unintended mechanic to scale damage in a creative way. Should the build be nerved? yes

But should GGG break their policies and stifle creative build creators by doing this mid-season? no

If it really is a bug like RF scaling with gems socket after activation, no one would complain, but patching out unintended mechanics and changing the rules mid-season is stupid and GGG not doing this was one of Path of exile coolest features. You never had a situation where you spend 10-20 hours just to make a build and find out it does no longer work a week later.

The problem is the president it sets for the Future. Are GGG now going to nerve any unintended Build mid-season if it does too much damage or is too tanky? where is the threshold between a good build and one ""too strong""? Do we have to guess what GGG thinks bevor making a build?

Also at least respond fast and decisive. First, it was ignored, then bug which basically only seriously affect this build was fixed. And the A TWO WEEKS later it is now to be removed? what is that?

I don’t think GGG should repel this decision as the already made it.

fsd3rr,SamuraiOfProg,Path of Exile: Trove league,"Just saw a post about Mimics and it got me thinking... What about a league where chests in the game (not including female chests) would become more interesting? I call it: ""Path of Exile: Trove league"". One instance spawns three ""Trove chests"" across the map and there is an icon on the minimap, which tells you what chest is a Trove chest (the icon appears on the minimap, even if your character is very far from it).  

There is also an icon that hovers over the chest, that indicates what the chest holds as it's trove. When you open a Trove chest, a lot of magic enemies will spawn simultaneously, which you have to kill. Sometimes deadly rare or even unique enemies can spawn too, but the event won't last all that long (depending on build, maybe something like: 10-20 seconds).

Some Trove chests can hold old-leagues inside of them, acting like ""Pandora's Boxes"" (every Trove chest has a 25% chance of spawning like this). The chest also has an icon that indicates what leagues it holds and when you open the chest, it will unleash all the leagues inside of it simultaneously, but the leagues are of course a bit toned down, in order to prevent content bloat and too rewarding rewards. 

The leagues are also leagues that have no alternate zones, for example: Temporal incursions. You can have between 1-3 leagues inside one of these kinds of Trove chests (they're also not weighted, so just as likely to have three rather than one). Things become insane, when you have a combo of something like: Beyond, Breach &amp; Delirium. These chests don't spawn the additional enemies you have to kill in order to open them, but instead will just spawn the leagues simultaneously after opening.

Every Trove chest also has a chance of spawning as a: ""Mimic"" (10% chance). These Mimics are unique enemies and are very, very tough (similar to juiced up Metamorphs), but any content that they hold are twice as rewarding. And about rewards, all Trove chests are pretty rewarding (think Blight chests), so this league can actually be the most rewarding league so far in the game, if you think about it. All three chests in a map are just as rewarding as Blight chests (sometimes even more rewarding) and you don't have to complete any super long event, to open them! 

Oh, by the way... Some Mimics (when killed) can drop Reliquary keys, some Metamorph organs and some even an endgame area map, which has far more Trove chests to experience and have fun with! The endgame area's availability is also not abysmally low (Not too sure about a correct drop chance, but maybe 10%?), so anyone farming maps can get to experience them. The endgame area map also can't drop in the story, only in maps! This is just a fun idea I had, what do you guys think? :)",1,1585662098,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fsd3rr/path_of_exile_trove_league/,pathofexile,1

I probably started to play HC at the worst time. Last League I didnt have much time for PoE and thought I could try to get into HC. I failed misserably since the Bosses got buffed hard. But it was to be expected as I dont really know for example the boss emchanics of dominus, whom I couldnt get past in 5 (3 different) attempts. I stopped there.  

   

This league I started again and failed even faster due to lag, brain lag und finnaly got to Act 4. I played a more durable class Templar and strived for a Archmage Stormbrand Build with Mind over Matter in the lategame.

And still died misrable in the fight against Daresso. Now again I dont know the mechanics of him since I never had any problems in the non-HC leagues I played before and even if I died once I usually got it on the second try, which is why I never bothered. As I was looking for advices for Act 3 Boss Dominus, I noticed, even in youtube you wont find much because the story bosses probably never cause any problem to the people.  

  

What I'd like to know is, was I badly prepared considering my stats or do I have to play though the main story in league to get to know everything before I can try it again? Because in my eyes I even put my found currency into some leveling gear and was pretty strong till this point. Imho most other build which are interesting to me right now are way more squishy. Which is why I am a bit discouraged and not sure whether I should drop HC or try it more, but the time invest of the first 2 acts is pretty much and if I try to speed through it I died too which was to be expected but I got impatient.  

  

What do you suggest? Playing an ""undying/op"" build just to get more HC experience and later try it with this again? Play through non-HC with a squishy class to get to know the mechanics of all the bosses? Are there milestones I can go along with? I heard something about \~300 life per act as an orientation for the bosses. Are there any specific and most important 3.9+ guides for HC beginners?",9,1585659674,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fschvc/hc_ps4_noob_got_a_bit_demotivated_starting_in_hc/,pathofexile,1

Then 4 link cast when dmg taken with steelskin, the recall gem (convocation I think) and spirit offering as a defensive layer. Trigger steelskin and recall minions to kill whatever is hurting me automatically. 

Then 4 link skittetbots with curse on hit and elemental weakness to make my mages hit harder. This last will only work if skitterbots trigger curse on hit ofc.

Same thing is happening in everywhere. I have to portal out regularly to get my FPS back while mapping. Which is really frustrating..

fsbmfe,borkenschnorke,My Delirium league journey,"I am going to write a lot about what I did and how I felt about Delirium and if you are not interested just stop reading and move on.  


Planning:

My plan was making a very cheap starter and just playing for 3-4 days saving some currency. The plan from there was to flip items for about a week or two to make a lot of currency and fund a very strong built. I started as a ED/Contagion trickster and even with really bad gear I managed to do t16 maps. The other build I had my eyes on was Bow Bleed Gladiator/champion but I felt it needed way more investment early on than ED. It was not very fun in hightier maps though with my really really bad gear. I had a 6l Sadist garb with 350ES and 1300Evasion and that was pretty much 99% of the worth of my character, everything else was 1-5c items.   
Flipping worked a little but not really well. Even with having 40ish livesearches active I couldn't really get a lot of items since I was late on almost all items. I just kept playing and tried getting the one or other unique here and there and bought some divcards to turn in and sell the outcome with a profit. I made a view exalts trading but I still made most of my currency from playing the game at that point.   
Delirium was bad at this state. It was really high risk with little reward. I was very happy after the delirium mechanic changes.  


Since trading didn't really work out I decided to reroll a Spellslinger necro. The leveling process was very enjoyable and when I reached maps I had insane defenses (12k ES with a lot of leech and reg). The damage however was lacking hard. So I decided to throw a lot of currency on the char to go crit instead of EO. I barely reached 1mio Shaper dps on really good gear. I crafted a +1dex+fire amulet and hit a lucky critchance+crit multi. I crafted a +1fire skills 300ES Shield with T1 critchance, 650ES spellcrit Body armour and the damage felt okay. I beat Awakener 5-6. At that point I could buy an awakened spell cascade and my damage got decent, not great but decent. However triggerbuilts are kind of laggy and with awakened spell cascade the game turned totally unplayable. I could still map but it felt horrible and I could do a view uber elders even with my fps was so bad that you should call it seconds per frame instead of frames per second. At the weekend after league start the game was now totally unplayable. I even had lags when putting items into my stash. So I rerolled SSF, like I do a lot of leagues.  


SSF start.  I still sold items worth 30c or more and crafted around with my currency trying to hit a mirror tier item but didn't get it.  
I started as a hierophant with stormbrand and archmage. I started playing the game (pretty noobish though) at a time when the last boss was piety and before even dominus was added. I started playing seriously in prophecy league and I came back for every single league since then. This storm brand archmage guy was the by farm most powerful starter built I ever played. When I reached maps I was deleting bosses with ONE tick from the storm brand. My defenses were decent with 4.5k Life 1.5kES and 5k mana. I beat Awakaner up to 8 on the char. For Endgame maps its a bit clunky to play and it dies a lot. The damage being totally over the top compared to the little investment needed. If this does not get nerved archmage+anything might turn into my go to league starter from now on.

At a some point there was a patch and the game started to run smoother than ever for me. I always had some lag-spikes and stuff but since that patch it is smooth like a babies but! It felt like a being almost blind and gaining back your eyesight.

I wanted a faster mapper and something decent to maybe, if I enjoyed it enough push to 100. So I started my 2nd SSF character as a Gladiator since I got my eyes on that built for a while now. I crafted a decent bleed bow, phys over time amu and gloves and started the character. Mapping on this guy feels really good. He runs faster without quicksilver flask than my hierophant with the flask. The defenses are decent at 6.5k life with motel shell, 76 resits and some armor. What the character lacks however is single target damage. In over 10 Simulacrums I was not able to get the Snipe helmet and I am chancing every studded belt for rythlata. Getting more than one or two lucky awakened gems in SSF also is not really doable and I did not get a hunter influenced quiver yet. Apart from that I am happy with my currency gear. I am still struggling with single target dps. It works for map bosses but I will not be trying awakener, Elder Shaper, etc anytime soon.  


The league in total was a good one. Delirium felt great after the changes. Really rewarding and makes you go zoom. The favorite map system is the one thing I really missed last league and is great. It is a little buggy however. I noticed getting the maps I selected for about 3-10 maps and then it stopped. Removing the favorite map and replacing them seems to fix the issue really well.  
I am currently a little burnt out and thinking about other builts but I don't have the energy right now to farm the uniques I need for those I would like to play on SSF. I will turn back my hours from now on and do some other stuff. Maybe when I get a good idea for a built I will grind another one and If I get a tanky character together that can kill map bosses at a decent pace I might push to 100. I am sitting at home quaratined anyways....  


Hope you guys are having a good league. I am open for recommendations for my gladiator. I'd like to push the single target damage without loosing defenses and it has to be realistic for SSF.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having some issues with map sustain and didn't know I was doing something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier in the league I farmed a Shavs by double Favoriting Tower maps and then basically running the atlas at A7 with no stones in Lira Arthain. It was awesome. The only t5 maps that dropped were Towers, and the only T3 and T4 maps that dropped were maps that could upgrade into Tower. It took me all of 6 hours or so to farm up 8 Offerings. I had more tower maps than I could run. The sustain was amazing.  


Now I'm trying to farm a Poet's Pen through Scriptorium. I'm trying to do it through Scriptorium because that has a stable figure-eight layout and museum is a mess. I'm attempting the same trick where I have that zone specifically lower (this time I have two watchstones in the Valdo area so I can get some extra packs from sextants). 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem I'm having is that maps don't drop....at all. I'll 100-120 quant corrupted map with fragments and just no maps drop. There are 8 t9 maps including Scrip that drop so it would have a 21/28 chance if a t9 map dropped, but I'm not seeing any maps at all. I don't know if my atlas is bugged or if I'm doing something wrong. Any help would be appreciated.

fsb1os,Zaryphos,"Trading this league is slowing us down more than the league mechanic ever could, and not only because the site is slow","The trading site very slow, sometimes even returning an error, but that's been known for a few days.

Another thing that wastes us a lot of time is buying currency. The first 30 or so listings on most currencies are either sold/afk/pricefixers. And this is becoming more of a problem with the increasing number of players. 

I don't want to make this post too long but i'll try to give an example. Imagine all players who try to buy ex will message the listings on the site, in order. Let's see some numbers

\- if 5 players want to buy 1ex at the same time, the slowest of them will have to message 5 people  
\-if 50 players want to buy 1ex at the same time, the slowest of them will have to message 50 people

Of course, on average you will have to message half of that, but you can see how this scales to our dissadvantage, even when there are also proportionately more people selling ex as there are buyers. 

And this is if consider most listings to be real. A lot of them are just pricefixers or afk people slowing everyone else down (this also overloads the site, because you have to browse it for longer, maybe refresh a few times, until you finally find a trade).

fsb0ci,The_Squelched,"State of the Game &amp; ""Multiplayer""","I'm sure this has been ranted about before and it might get a spam of downvotes but I don't care. I needed to share my feelings and thoughts about mid to end game. 


Over the last handful of leagues the atlas has changed a lot and new things were introduced. Sirus and the new guardians are neat and while I have cleared that new content I can't say it was without it's downsides. I have a group of friends I have been playing with since Talisman league. We have a guild discord server and in-game guild as well that I put money into. Up until Awakener of Worlds (AoW), there was no problem with us mapping together and even killing shaper and uber elder; we worked together and got credit together, including the memory fragments.


After the altas changed again with the release of 3.9.0, the Metamorph league, and AoW, that all changed. We could map together and gain only the atlas bonus, but not the awakened atlas orbs from the guardians? Now this wouldn't matter if the chosen host was always on and we always were together, but that's never the case. Every gamer in the world has been online and wanted to play when one of their friends hasn't been online. Squading up is always tons of fun. On day 0, of each new league, we party up and go through all 10 acts together. Since the change, we have been forced to split up at maps and complete our own atlases, which can take a couple days to a weeks worth of work depending on RNG. Quite frankly, it just becomes boring to play by ourselves since we want to be able to end game stuff when no-one else is online, especially since it takes so much longer to complete than the previous atlas versions.


I know that Path of Exile 2.0 is going to come out soonish and we don't have all the details yet of how things are going to work. But please GGG, for the love of this game, please make the core of the game more multiplayer friendly.

fsa846,GlbdS,Question from a group of casuals,"Hi people,

With a couple colleagues we were thinking about playing PoE together some time, should be 4-5 of us. I went in yesterday with one of them and leveled up to 11. 

I'm starting to get how it generally works and like it, but I'm getting a bit scared by how important the meta seems to be, with having to constantly reroll and stuff. 

So my question would be: Do you think that this game can be enjoyable casually with a couple friends? Is it really that important to start building a specific build right away? Would just taking ""whatever"" in our passive skills be very damageable in the future? I don't think any of us it planning on playing this that much, just enough to have fun a couple nights a week for the duration of the quarantine. If you also have advice on how to make it as enjoyable as possible, we're of course takers!

fsa5t0,matrixkid29,So i just reached act 2. Im totally new to this genre of game.,"This is my first time playing this genre of game. I made a Templar and I found a couple spell/gems i like that i put in a staff. Ive been using smite with ancestral call and a lightning buffer. I also found a spell called frost blink which i use alot with its own buffer.

In an attempt to contain the games massive learning curve, Im just spending my skills based on those two spells as well as staff and armor. So ive been moving down toward a couple groups of staff skill sets and then ive also been moving up to a small group of skills (storm skills i think they are called (lightning and frost)) because those are the two damage types i use.

I don't ill be changing much up until the game throws something at me I cant handle. The more i play, the more i realize that this is all just practice for a second play through. Or at least until all this new jargon becomes a bit more natural to me.

Why am i posting? not sure. Maybe a bit of a time capsule to look back on and chuckle at when im level 100.

fs9m3t,crotchgravy,A small Trade QOL that may make a huge difference,"So as much as it would be nice if trade was more automated I can also understand that too much convenience could cause more harm than good.  

There is a simple change I think even GGG couldn't refute and it would make things a lot better for everyone.  

The main frustration is just simply getting people to respond to smaller trades such as maps, currency, fragments etc.  What if all GGG did was have an option in their trade site to see where the player currently is by clicking on their name.  This way we would know that if the player is in their hideout there is a much higher chance that they would respond.   

If you are going through a list of 20 people all listing at a similar price it would be great to just click the name quickly and see which person is more likely to respond.  

 We could even go one step further and GGG could give players an option to toggle a status when you are in your hideout.  A toggle that says you are ready to sit and trade for a while.  If the site wasn't too laggy it could then update the color of your name, or perhaps show up when you click the name to see what the players status is.  

These are just some very simple options that would not take much from GGG's side to implement and make trade a less frustrating problem for everyone.",8,1585645398,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs9m3t/a_small_trade_qol_that_may_make_a_huge_difference/,pathofexile,1

fs9jzw,JuicyRibeye,We Need an Auction House in the Game/Individual Loop Drop,"Trading is so tedious in this game.  Not only I have to be online at the right time to just buy and sell items, but I also have to use a website to do so.  It's extremely inconvenient, or rather frustrating for many players without saying.  Many times when I get an item with decent stats drop, I gotta go on the website to check the prices for similar items.  It kills the flow of the game really.  If I wanna sell my stuff, I have to be online and not doing anything that takes a long time.  It restrict me from actually playing the game if I wanna sell.  I wish the buyers can just take the items and give me the currency without me actually being there to trade with them.

Buying stuff is even more frustrating.  When I search for an item on the website, it only shows the sellers who is currently online.  I can't really get a good look at all the possible items that fit my criteria, cuz 90% of them are not showing due to the sellers being offline.  Finding an item that you want in a limited item selection is one thing, but getting the sellers to respond is another.  9/10 sellers I whisper don't even reply.  I know the reasons why people don't reply, and the website doesn't update in real time, but it upsets me when I get ignored, which ruins my game experience to a certain degree.   
 Sometimes I have to spend an hour to search an simple item and find a seller that actually responds, and most of the time when that happens, the item is usually overpriced.  

All the problems and frustration can be solved by simply implementing an auction house.  Trading already exists, why make us suffer to just have access to a function that the game already supports?   
 Let us check prices in real time without going out of the game, sell items without being interrupted or being online, and buy items from both online and offline sellers with just a simple click, so we can just keep playing the game instead of staring at the screen waiting for someone to whisper/reply.  

If GGG wants players to interact with each other, this trading system is definitely the wrong way to go.  It only kills the game flow and frustrates people.  Making the loop drop be individual drop to promote coop play is a much better way to make players interact with each other.  I don't know why this isn't a thing, coop can make the game so much more fun for players and attract more audiences who enjoy playing with others.  Even though you can play with others in the game, the shared loop defeats the purpose of playing the game.  People like to get awesome loot and become more powerful, but shared loop system makes the game basically a solo game.  I bought a ton of micro-transactions, a small part of that is because I like to make myself look cool, but the main reason is I like to show my customized character to my friends.  However, the solo aspect of the game made me never play with my friends.  Most of them never even seen my character, which is very sad.  What's the point of dressing up, if I can't even show off?  Most F2P game with skin micro transactions promotes coop, so other people will want to buy cosmetics too.  It's a good marketing strategy if you think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

RL;DR: Auction house can solve the pain and suffer of the current trading system, it keeps the game flow and helps players to focus on playing the game instead of staring at the screen wasting time, and makes the game more user friendly.

Individual loop drop promotes coop play, which improves player interaction in a fun way.  It also attracts a wider player base who enjoys playing with others.

fs990e,jaggysnake57,Should 3.11 be pushed back?,"  

so first off this is my first post (I think) I rarely comment so please be gentle. 

I think we all know that 3.10 has been a disaster. from the overturned mobs to poor visuals, poor performance, broken builds, poor Sirius fight mechanics.... it’s a mess. it also seems to have shown all the weakness with the game now. 

trade is a mess, as PoE has grown trade just is not fit for purpose anymore. The trade site struggles with load, trading has become slow, cumbersome, and clunky, not to mention the number of scammers out there. Bots make some trading better but that is a terrible situation to be in. when you have use methods against the ToS to make your system work, your system is broken.

Loot has also become dated. If most of your players hide 50% of loot dropped then why drop it? Its just a waste of resources. Surely it would be better to have quality not quantity, from a development point of view. 

Given the current global situation, and the fact that many including GGG are in lockdown surely, we can’t be expecting 3.11 on time. Surely it must be delayed. I think this is the perfect time to halt development on 3.11 and instead work on fixing the issues that the community have talked about over the last month.

fs8vuf,Nagasuka92,GGG is failing more and more each league.,"Where do i even start? Maybe with recent Herald stacking build. Just before the league launched, people were already saying that Herald cluster jewels will be probably busted and strong AF. They didn't even bothered to test this shit. And now here we are. Bex said it won't be nerfed, so people invested time and currency into this, then suddenly GGG changed their minds and decided to Nerf it. OK, i understand, it deserved nerf, but do you guys even test this game before throwing shit like this into our faces, is this Public test realm or what?

Second: Each league performance is getting worse and worse, some people still cant play Because you fucked up something in one of the millions of patches you release every week. crashes, disappearing textures, latency reaching the sky or tons of other shit, that is going on with this game. Disabling sound effects in config file to boost our frames.. Seriously? How the fuck something like that can even happen.

And last, the best, and biggest fuck up of the whole game TRADING system. Every day, every week, every month, every fucking League people are complaining about this hideous and outdated thing. Do you guys really think alt tabbing, going to slow-running site's looking for an item and texting 50 people to do a trade is a fun thing to do? No, this is fucking frustrating. Frustration is the worst thing that can happen playing any game, and this shit kills all the fun. Are you going to do something about it in this league or next, or even in 2020? Probably not, better thing is to listen some reddit whiners about herald thing and nerf it mid league, even when we said just before the start, this thing will be broken.

I dont remember such craze about certain items since mjolner and shavs  were dozens of exalts long time ago. (correct me if im wrong , ofcourse)

I'd like to hear what particular ""gamebreaking"" thing about it jumpstarted the idea of nerfing it mid league? 

Was there something previously unheard of that happened? 

Something dev's didnt even think would be affected  a week ago? 

What exactly changed between leaving it be a week ago and deciding to do something about it now?

How does the process about deciding what to do with it, work even?

is the number of people who invested in to the build affect how  the nerf will go ? (aka, not nerfing the mechanic of the  item, like..  what if it only affects auras from skills, but not auras from items? so it would still be really good but not 10 milion dps after 2 headhunter buffs type of good) 

and what was the first moment you(devs) realised this might be a problem?

fs8cjx,aemerzelis,Increased Effect of Arcane Surge,"I've been running into an issue where it feels like Arcane Surge isn't being calculated properly.

I am utilizing Orb of Storms + Archmage + Culling Strike + Arcane Surge (lvl 20), and Arcane Surge level 20 is proccing on every cast.

I also have the cluster that provides increased effect of Arcane Surge allocated fully, yet it does not seem to work as I think it should.

Here's my [POB](https://pastebin.com/8mmpLGLp)

Standing in hideout, if I cast OoS my Lightning damage goes from
(27529-35780) to (39925-51893)

This is an increase of 45% 

Level 20 Arcane surge support provides 20% More spell damage from Arcane Surge + another 19% more spell damage from the support gem.

The way I think it should work is I should be getting 1.32 (base arcane surge 20% with 60% increased effect from the passive cluster) * 1.19 = 1.57, with the first part working on all of my spells. This does not appear to work, as I am clearly getting 45% more and not 57% more.

My storm brand in this setup (which is not supported by arcane surge) is getting 21% More damage from the Arcane surge (((115524+12855)/2)/((94879+105577)/2))

Moreover, the stat in POB (community fork) doesn't seem to be doing anything, even though it isn't redded out.

I would like to play somewhat strong winter orb build if possible, and if not, just a string aura stacking build.Thanks in advance!

I'm not great at this game, i don't make mirror and headhunters each league but this time around i played enough to make more money than ever. I ended up with really nice geared cyclone glad and saved up decent amount of money ontop of it. I was planning even on getting my first 100 lvl.

Than i saw that it is possible to play winter orb with the interactions of the herald notables and guardian and have a really strong build. Seeing how prices were going up and GGG confirmed its not going to get nerfed i started selling my stuff and buying items like soltice vilgil and voices.

As we all know it will actually get nerfed and this cost me not only money that i lost by selling my items underpriced (cause i wanted to play the build asap) but also things like soltice dropped from 35-40 ex to under 10 ex overnight. In total it cost me more money than i usually make in entire league.

I was pretty devastated i wanted to quit the league immediately, but after cooling down a bit i decided that i might still might give it a shot after i saw some comments that you can still make the build work.

I don't really have the knowledge to make it myself so this is where i need a little bit of help - i have around 40-50 ex left, x1 voices and 3 jewels with notables. I would like to try and still play this aura stacking thing with nice skill (winter orb would be great).

I was wondering if anyone has pastebin or maybe could direct me to a guide i could use to try and reroll something similar to this:

fs707n,ProphetWasMuhammad,"Apparently, the Mods of this subreddit is Removing All Negative Feedback.","Both my feedback on the upcoming Aura nerfs as well as questions regarding how to refund supporter packs have been removed.

The reason for such removal was supposedly that it was similar in topic to another post. Yet the front page is filled with posts regarding the nerf, all of which are positive. So that was believable. Anyway, here is the post. As you can clearly see, it's a perfectly reasonable angry post.

This is an angry post because I am angry. 

It's one thing to completely gut my build. It's another to treat me like an idiot while doing so.

The former usually not done because changing the rules to destroy those people who were winning the game is generally reserved for trollish party games and communist dictatorships. A tournament which suddenly bans all Koreans half way through would be treated as a joke, not a needed balance change.

This is especially egregious when some of the players have invested a hundred hours of work into theory-crafting, farming, and making the build, and the said balance change involves destroying that work.

That said, the former can only destabilize the self-contained economy, demotivate being the best, and make a joke out of the notion of competition. How can players compete seriously when being the best is punished, when the rules can change at a moment's notice? It can only discourage theory crafting, punish build sharing, and encourage paranoia. After all, who knows whether my build will be nerfed next?

I don't feel the need to go in-depth why the former is a bad idea. If I can figure this out, I expect GGG, whom I've drawn inspirations from, to already know this. I expect GGG to know that the former sets a precedence and has consequences far more long-reaching and worse than having a supposedly overpowered ""build"" (quotation marks lifted from announcement) in a league with the most build diversity.

From now on, whenever I want to make a build that I intend to play for more than a day, I'll have to ask myself: should I really put in 2 weeks of work to get it online when it might randomly go poof?

I won't go into the former. But the latter? The latter offends me.

This change was made because some vocal amount of people who base all their information off of some 500 ex build in a video, who has never played the build, decided that it was OP and cried loud enough. And GGG caved. But because they are unable to actually put in the significant amount of work necessary to actually make a reasonable change - a completely understandable situation given the quarantine - they went with a band-aid fix after deciding that destroying people's efforts is fine if enough people cries out about public benefits.

Since this is the case, could GGG not also insult our intelligence and just admit this truthfully? None of these excuses about what was ""intended"" and what players ""don't think as auras"".

First of all, the game is never crystal clear about the mechanics. Nine tenth of the interactions are obtuse and undocumented, half of them by design! GGG has always hidden information from us and encouraged us to experiment to figure out the rules of the game.

Does anyone remember GGG's response when it was finally revealed that ""prefixes cannot be changed"" overrides scouring orbs after a year of misinformation, allowing select players to make 50 ex bows for 10 ex? ""Working as intended. Keep experimenting to find new ways to exploit the game!"" Why should we when what we figure out can be immediately destroyed?

Second of all, if the passive were originally supposed to only affect skills, it would have been implemented as such. All the aura buff effects on the normal tree explicitly say ""auras from skills"", and only affects aura from skills. This one doesn't. It clearly was meant to work with ALL auras.

Finally and most egregiously, ""things [...] players don't think as auras"". I'd like to believe that players are capable of understanding the notion of aura, and being able to associate it with the words ""you and nearby allies"". Many headhunter buffs are clearly aura. We can clearly see the rares having effects on nearby mobs. sNot to mention, the Summon Harbinger of Time skill literally says ""create a slipstream AURA"".

So now we have this unenviable situation for everyone involved. Builds are destroyed. People are demotivated. Trust is lost. And what has happened? GGG has changed one confusing system into another and expects us to figure out how things work now? Figuring out the rules of the game is only fun when it doesn't change at random intervals, unless we are playing the game of Mao.

What is a skill anyways? This doesn't say ""skills from players"". If my spectres give an aura. Does that count? Consecrated Path creates a consecrated ground. Does that count? The slipstream aura from Harbinger of Time seems like it is a skill cast by the Harbinger, so does that count? Unwavering faith is currently affected by ""increased effect of Non-curse Auras from your skills"". Does that count?

After completing ruining all out work at figuring out these kind of things, are we expected to try to figure out the rules of this new game?

I can accept Golems, or tailwind boots, being removed from the aura pool. GGG can justify them as bugs. But there are limits. GGG cannot obfuscate half the rules of the game, encourage us to figure them out, and then claim we are abusing unintended mechanics.

Thus ends my angry post, but not my anger. I've spent the last two weeks theory-crafting, farming, experimenting, and slowly putting together my Guardian build. It just got to 7k ES. Now, it's going to be a bad version of a Smite-Ball Lightning build.",12,1585631782,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs707n/apparently_the_mods_of_this_subreddit_is_removing/,pathofexile,1

fs6o68,gabsonuro,new player stuck between game leagues,"I’m a newish player, this is my second league and i’m stuck in between leagues where i don’t really have an option.


I’ve played softcore and it’s fine and all, but the two things i really really dislike:

1. I hate trading, it’s tedious, annoying, most of the time i cant even buy the stuff i want since most don’t respond. Plus getting hundreds of pm’s for stuff. I don’t exactly know the price of most items since game knowledge, so i tend to place them in a dump tab thats set around 10c and whatever i get whispers on must be worth something. Obviously with the issues with trading sites right now i get pm’s for stuff i re-priced a day ago or sold a day or two ago.

2. When i do end up getting the gear i need i lose interest since i feel i’ve “completed” the character. I havent done shaper or elder or any of the uber encounters, but it feels pretty de-motivating running maps to farm currency when 99.999999% of the stuff that drops is worthless crap.


I tried a character on SSF and i liked it, however i also had some issues

1. Clearly i don’t have the game knowledge to fully play SSF, let alone picking or creating a character that is strong enough

2. End up stuck and having to grind a metric shitload to get a specific item, or a specific craft. Thousands of alterations or alchs take a while to get even on soft core, and with the probability so low to get the stuff you want it can be pretty frustrating

3. Delirium/simulacrum encounter is really really boring and frustrating particularly on SSF, its just endlessly ridiculously tanky mods with no particular strategy or mechanics, its just kill impossible to kill stuff (unless you have some super mega dps build) or be killed

fs68ok,lehmannthiago,It`s the first time I`m leaving a PoE league this early. Delirium design is just too much.,"This is not an angry rant, just my personal opinion with a bit of frustration. I\`d like to hear other players opinions because I usually play by myself.

I love the game, played thousand of hours since Talisman league, never left early. Usually go for 24 to 36 challenges. Lately i\`ve been playing SSF (for the last 6 leagues i think) and I really enjoy the feeling of building and crafting your own stuff, not worrying about making cash.  


Delirium, for me, is just a bland league. You\`re always running against the clock, mobs are always exploding and even after the update it\`s still hard to understand the clusterfuck under the mist if you really juice up your maps (specially on maps like Lava Lake). Killing bosses in the middle of the mist is just dealing with health sponges and doing simulacrum is just a less exciting version of the Blight maps. Apparently making leagues overlap turned a game that was already chaotic in to absolute chaos. It feels like Breach gone wrong.  


I hope PoE 2 manages to slow down the game a bit. It\`s kinda hard to enjoy it when you feel compelled to just go for the most powerful build in order to actually see what the league has to offer. I\`ll probably take a break and return later in the league cycle to play a bit more.  


I get the feeling it\`s the first time in many years that the early game was more interesting than the end game, just for the pace and visual clarity.  


Anyone else feeling this way about the league ? I usually play alone so it\`s hard to have conversations about the state of the game.

fs5fxw,AT1313,Delirium boss fights need fixing.,"While the splinter drop at the end of the fog is a good thing, the fact that the fog can dissipate during a boss fight is frustrating. While it can be done by applying delirium orbs, the fact remains that we can't pause the fog in a boss arena. Furthermore, the fight is dependent on your build and if you can't insta murder a juiced red map the boss within 10seconds with your build, it's a waste of splinters. Worst if the boss has phases.

Delirium was marketed as 'fight the bosses but stronger' but what's the point if the fog dissipates while Innocence is immune? 

It would honestly be better if they did what they did with  some of the league mechanics where the fog pauses. Maybe it only pauses in the boss arena and a certain radius around a open area boss.

fs5cys,digbatfiggernick,Arbitrage - Simple Money Making Tips,"Some currencies have shards that can be collected and combined into that currency. Take exalted orb for example, you need 20 shards to make one exalted orb.

For all practical purposes, an exalted shard is 1/20th of an exalted orb. The price of exalted orbs fluctuate throughout the day and logic dictates that the price of shards too will fluctuate. However the change is not instantaneous. Sometimes you see the change in orbs before shards, and sometimes it is the other way around. 

Lets say one exalted orb goes for 100 chaos and one shard goes for 5 chaos. Someone buys all exalted orbs listed at 100 up to 109 chaos and now best ask price for an exalt becomes 110 chaos. However, at this time, a shard still costs 5 chaos. You can then buy 20 of such shards, make it into an exalted orb and sell it for more than what it costed you to buy up the shards. This is called arbitrage. This example is simplified because it is rare that a shard is 1/20th of an orb, as usually it is slightly more expensive, but that is the gist of it.

fs55nn,ProphetWasMuhammad,An Angry Post about My Last Angry Post Being Removed,"This is a follow up angry post because my last angry post got removed. Now I am even more angry. In my anger, I shall copy and paste my last angry post here.

https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs4xa1/an_angry_post_in_response_to_the_purposeful/

This is an angry post because I am angry. You know I am angry because I am making a new post instead of commenting on Bex's post. I want everyone to know how angry I am.

It's one thing to completely gut my build. It's another to treat me like an idiot while doing so.

The former usually not done because changing the rules to destroy those people who were winning the game is generally reserved for trollish party games and communist dictatorships. A tournament which suddenly bans all Koreans half way through would be treated as a joke, not a needed balance change.

This is especially egregious when some of the players have invested a hundred hours of work into theory-crafting, farming, and making the build, and the said balance change involves destroying that work.

That said, the former can only destabilize the self-contained economy, demotivate being the best, and make a joke out of the notion of competition. How can players compete seriously when being the best is punished, when the rules can change at a moment's notice? It can only discourage theory crafting, punish build sharing, and encourage paranoia. After all, who knows whether my build will be nerfed next?

I don't feel the need to go in-depth why the former is a bad idea. If I can figure this out, I expect GGG, whom I've drawn inspirations from, to already know this. I expect GGG to know that the former sets a precedence and has consequences far more long-reaching and worse than having a supposedly overpowered ""build"" (quotation marks lifted from announcement) in a league with the most build diversity.

From now on, whenever I want to make a build that I intend to play for more than a day, I'll have to ask myself: should I really put in 2 weeks of work to get it online when it might randomly go poof?

I won't go into the former. But the latter? The latter offends me.

This change was made because some vocal amount of people who base all their information off of some 500 ex build in a video, who has never played the build, decided that it was OP and cried loud enough. And GGG caved. But because they are unable to actually put in the significant amount of work necessary to actually make a reasonable change - a completely understandable situation given the quarantine - they went with a band-aid fix after deciding that destroying people's efforts is fine if enough people cries out about public benefits.

Since this is the case, could GGG not also insult our intelligence and just admit this truthfully? None of these excuses about what was ""intended"" and what players ""don't think as auras"".

First of all, the game is never crystal clear about the mechanics. Nine tenth of the interactions are obtuse and undocumented, half of them by design! GGG has always hidden information from us and encouraged us to experiment to figure out the rules of the game.

Does anyone remember GGG's response when it was finally revealed that ""prefixes cannot be changed"" overrides scouring orbs after a year of misinformation, allowing select players to make 50 ex bows for 10 ex? ""Working as intended. Keep experimenting to find new ways to exploit the game!"" Why should we when what we figure out can be immediately destroyed?

Second of all, if the passive were originally supposed to only affect skills, it would have been implemented as such. All the aura buff effects on the normal tree explicitly say ""auras from skills"", and only affects aura from skills. This one doesn't. It clearly was meant to work with ALL auras.

Finally and most egregiously, ""things [...] players don't think as auras"". I'd like to believe that players are capable of understanding the notion of aura, and being able to associate it with the words ""you and nearby allies"". Many headhunter buffs are clearly aura. We can clearly see the rares having effects on nearby mobs. sNot to mention, the Summon Harbinger of Time skill literally says ""create a slipstream AURA"".

So now we have this unenviable situation for everyone involved. Builds are destroyed. People are demotivated. Trust is lost. And what has happened? GGG has changed one confusing system into another and expects us to figure out how things work now? Figuring out the rules of the game is only fun when it doesn't change at random intervals, unless we are playing the game of Mao.

What is a skill anyways? This doesn't say ""skills from players"". If my spectres give an aura. Does that count? Consecrated Path creates a consecrated ground. Does that count? The slipstream aura from Harbinger of Time seems like it is a skill cast by the Harbinger, so does that count? Unwavering faith is currently affected by ""increased effect of Non-curse Auras from your skills"". Does that count?

After completing ruining all out work at figuring out these kind of things, are we expected to try to figure out the rules of this new game?

I can accept Golems, or tailwind boots, being removed from the aura pool. GGG can justify them as bugs. But there are limits. GGG cannot obfuscate half the rules of the game, encourage us to figure them out, and then claim we are abusing unintended mechanics.

Thus ends my angry post, but not my anger. I've spent the last two weeks theory-crafting, farming, experimenting, and slowly putting together my Guardian build. It just got to 7k ES.

But the type of reward has to be specific to that league. Theres no point in rendering other content like delve, breach, lab, blight, metamorph, legion and pretty much everything else useless because the league mechanic will just give you so much rewards of those types.

Why even run a breach or a blight when you get more in delirium? Why even enter the mine and delve when you already swim in fossils doing maps? Why even fiddle with the immortal syndicate to get some valuable scarabs when the market is flooded with scarabs from delirium.

One of the strengths of Path of Exile in the last year was that there were different mechanics you could farm or concentrate on. Now you get everything just by running a map. Everything is so inflated getting a gilded scarab drop isn't something you're exiting about anymore. It's just another random item that is worth nothing because it's value is so inflated.

fs4h2k,derivative_of_life,"Why the Trade Manifesto is not based in reality, and a possible solution","For those who haven't read it, the infamous [Trade Manifesto](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2025870) from ~2.5 years ago. AFAIK, Chris still stands by everything he said here.

&gt; People who are heavily engaged in trade perform fewer item upgrades to achieve their final build. They get there in fewer steps, because they can easily buy items that are close to what they need. Simply put, their character progression is more about trading than it is about getting items from monsters. We believe that it is more fun to slowly and iteratively upgrade a character over time and to have a longer journey to gear a character up. Knowing that a monster could drop something that improves your character is a great motivator for playing one more level!

This does not reflect the current state of PoE. It didn't reflect it two and a half years ago, and it's only gotten worse since then. That's just the reality of the situation. When was the last time you picked up and ID'd a random rare in a trade league and it was better than the item you already had equipped? Maybe while you were leveling, but once you're well into maps, the idea is laughable. Pretty much the only items high level players bother to pick up are currency, things which are easily exchangeable for currency, and crafting bases. To be perfectly honest, if GGG thinks finding strong gear is still a major part of their game, then they need to wake up and smell the fossils. As far as I'm concerned, that starting misconception invalidates the entire trade manifesto.

The reality of the situation is that there's so much build diversity in PoE that even if a piece of gear is strong, it's very unlikely to be what you need for your specific build. And that's okay! That's why trading exists. It's still exciting to find a piece of gear that's strong for some other build, so you can trade it for something that works for *your* build. And that brings us to the next point:

&gt; Compare two hypothetical games. In the first game, trade is very difficult. The majority of items that can't be used by your character are not traded to other people. In the second game, trade is very easy. Many of the items that you can't use are traded to other people for items that you can. In the second game, because of trade, you have a much higher acquisition rate of useful items. While that sounds great if you want instant gratification, in reality it means that the second game either receives reduced drop rates relative to the first, or ends up being a whole lot easier and less challenging to achieve goals in.

We all know how much power creep there's been since the game release, and trade is the main cause of it. A player's chances of finding 3 Voices and 9 cluster jewels with Purposeful Harbinger themselves are approximately nil point nil. As the player base grows larger and larger, it becomes easier and easier to find the perfect gear for your build. Just last league that had to multiply endgame boss life by a factor of *four* to keep things even slightly challenging, and that's with drops that are already so bad, most high level players filter out literally 99.9 percent of all items. GGG's current strategy as outline in the Trade Manifesto **is not working**. That is an indisputable fact. Every single player knows it, and it's time for GGG to admit it too. Please, Chris, for the love of god, you know it's true.

It's ultimately up to GGG how they want to solve this problem, and I'm not a professional game designer or anything, but I'll give my suggestion anyway. As I said before, the problem here is that there's so many players now, it's almost certain that someone will have the exact item you're looking for. The solution is to limit the pool of sellers. PoE has gotten big enough that it needs some sort of realm system, which limits how many people you can trade with.

Literally the first day of the league he buys 100 exalts and a mirror.

But looking on a certain site there is a seller with an inventory of over 100k exalts and over 1k Mirrors. Either these guys are hacking (which must be obvious if they were) or someone is running like a 30,000 strong bot farm. It seems so suspicious.

Make us find that warlord or elder base...
Make us farm delve fossils for crafting.. just make them more abundant....I could go on.

Uniques I would say should still be traded as they are special... this gives you the ability to obtain uniques from parts of the game you dont plan on focusing on.

This idea would add challenge and accomplishment to the game, you can't buy maps anymore, you have to progress efficiently on your own.

Needless to say the drop rates would need to go up a little to make it fair but i think this would ease a lot of the burden of trying to find the best rare peices for your build when you can make then yourself...the way the game was originally designed.

They said we want to slow the game down; they make a league where only zoom zoom builds feel like you are not missing out on the league mechanics ( unless you count having to back track your map sometimes to finish it/pick up loot) . they said they where not going to nerf that jewel mod and guess what? Mid-league nerf.
 I am prbly just salty because this is my most disliked league in a year or so but come on. I know this company can do a whole lot better. I really hope the success isn't getting to their heads. IE the while thing with Chris saying pretty much ""cuz we said so and that's what we want. Sirus fight is a joke but don't have time to fix it and make it engaging.

fs3s4v,whssp,PSA: Even after the Temporal Chains self-curse nerf you can still easily reach the slow cap and have 80 seconds HH buffs,"The baseline slow expiry cap from TC on players is 20%. 

With Solstice Vigil you need 175% Curse effect on Temporal Chains to reach 75% slower expiry rate of buffs and debuffs.

Without Solstice Vigil (if you wanna use Zerphi's Heart) you need 275% Curse effect on Temporal Chains to reach 75% slower expiry rate of buffs and debuffs.

So how we get to 175% curse effect?

* 30% Temporal Chains Curse Effect helmet enchant
* 11% from 22% quality Curse on hit gem
* 4% from Conqueror's Potency
* 120% from 3 medium cluster jewels with curse effect (you can use Voices jewel)

You need 6 passives on curse jewels. You get 10% curse effect from  Dark Discourse notable. What people forget, the small passives give 5% curse effect. You can roll 25% increased effect on small passives on cluster jewels. So Dark Discourse + 5x 6% curse effect is 40% curse effect on one medium jewel. One Voices branch with 3 medium cluster curse jewels gives 120% curse effect.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point we are at 165% curse effect. Occultist gets 25% from ascendancy or you can just annoint Skittering Runes, resulting in over 175%.

&amp;#x200B;

Compared to previous leagues you now have to spend around 25 extra passives to reach the expiry cap. Doesn't sound too good but remember with this much curse effect you are also increasing your damage from Elemental Weakness and relative defense when slowing down the monsters.

fs3hts,dannik42,"The Purposeful Harbinger fiasco, trust in GGG regarding nerfs?","It seems apparent at this point  from GGG's completely inconsistent approach to nerfs and flip-flopping that they have yet to determine a clear path for what is acceptable in the game.  As a player who tries to do the most powerful thing when possible, it is understandable that balance changes will ultimately move that target around.  It's a different matter entirely when at any point a mechanic your build is designed to take advantage of gets changed well into a league.  The problem is exacerbated when you get confirmation that the mechanics you were counting on won't be changed in the league, because it acknowledges that they know it is too powerful but is fine to exist until the next one.  

Many players invested countless amounts of time and currency into creating a build that they were assured would function for the whole league, to be stripped of all that time and currency out of nowhere.  

Is the point that we \*shouldn't\* be trying to do the most powerful thing in the game?  I think that is core to what aRPGs are to a lot of people.  To argue that ""this was clearly too overpowered"" is drawing an arbitrary line, which, yeah, GGG admitted as much, but with the caveat that it could survive for a league.

On a further note, all communication surrounding this situation has been lackluster.  Should every player be mandated to keep refreshing Reddit to make sure the build they're intending to play hasn't been scheduled for execution in a Reddit post?  Spending all your currency to purchase something and then finding out that mere minutes ago it was drastically devalued by something you have to dig to find is demoralizing.

What I personally would like to change in the future - 

**Clarity on Power Level**

We should be able to ascertain from the devs what an acceptable level of power is, and for how long we're allowed to play above that threshold before it gets nerfed.  The game is being continually re-balanced on a league-by-league basis, how are we supposed to predict what is ""too good"" to survive a single league?

**Better and Accurate Communication**

Bex is awesome, and hopefully this situation has impressed on everyone that giving players the ""All Clear"" isn't something you can do lightly.  If GGG has made a decision that affects many players and the game economy, we should not have to dive into a Reddit thread to get that information.  The first place it should be posted is on the official website, preferably with an in-game notification.  

PS -

fs301e,maggieforyou,"We don't need an auction house, we need a player-controlled smart loot system","TL;DR at the bottom



### What's the problem?
Recently reddit has seen a large number of requests for an auction house or trade improvements due to player dissatisfaction with trading. Trading is tedious, unintuitive, and time-consuming. Original game design intends drops to be meaningful, as evident from the lack of a central currency or gold system, where players are encouraged to craft their own gear, or make whatever gear they find ""work"". GGG don't want players to simply pick up items, liquidate them for currency, and buy whatever they want. A core aspect of the gameplay loop is picking up items, identifying them, looking at the mods, seeing if they will work, and then using orbs on them for a chance at improved stats. This is a meaningful loot system because players engage with the loot qua loot, if players simply vendor everything for currency then there is no loot, only currency one step removed and the next step is for players to request that all loot drops as vendored (tramsmog tempest anyone?).



### Why would I want to pick up rares?
GGG has talked about making measurable improvements to rare items (one of the exilecon talks I believe), some kind of smart system that makes these items strictly better for the players and reduces useless items from dropping. However they have said that the only thing players notice is that the number of items dropped decreased, and even though the few that do are _better_, they do not compare to what the player wants, and they don't even notice. This issue is perpetuated by the functionality of loot filters, which serve two main purposes. The first being that they customise the way items look and sound, they are able to draw more attention to what players want through colours and sizes and sounds and everything that is great about them. However they also completely hide items that are deemed too worthless to look at, items that the player does not want to even think about. I agree that hiding items is necessary in the current state of the game, the screen clutter introduced by showing every item at once in juiced maps and encounters can make those encounters unplayable. This is where GGG's solution comes into play, reducing the quantity of items, but increasing their quality would greatly reduce the number of items that loot filters hide. If players felt that it was worth their time to look at items, if there was meaningful loot that players engage with, then the game would move towards the environment that GGG wants, away from maximising chaos/hour towards increasing items per hour. Farming and efficiency have always been a part of ARPGs, and this would remain, however the dynamic would change, players would be able to farm for items they want and need, and not simply for guaranteed profit. This would significantly reduce the need for loot filters to hide items, serving mainly as a customisable way to display loot, not to make judgements about item value.



### Why would anyone want to farm for items when all rares suck?
A smart rare system. This idea is not new, and I'm sure GGG have tested and implemented things behind the scenes to incrementally improve rare items and test ways of making them more valuable for the player. However, the complexity of builds, mods, item influences, etc all make this very difficult if not impossible. The solution to this would be allowing players to choose what mods they want. This could be implemented as a new master, act NPC, or whatever system GGG wants. Players should be allowed to select bases they want to drop, and mods they want to drop, and then weights of items dropping would heavily favour these bases and mods. For example imagine finishing act 10 and wanting to fill out defenses, you might want to select mods that relate to life and resistances, and choose that dex base you want. Once you hit maps you might need to get some more int for a skill gem and you have a shitty pair of boots, no worries select those str base boots and choose int and movespeed and start identifying items. This system would be adaptable to suit the players needs in a way that an automatic system would not. I am not proposing any specific method for doing this, or costs associated with changing mod preferences, or weights involved, that would all be up to GGG to determine what they want players to get out of it. However a system like this would encourage players to pick up items they need, and have loot be meaningful for players.



### Issues with this
* Performance: The server would need to store and calculate weights for each individual account which may prove unnecessarily straining on GGG's infrastructure.
* New players: New players do not understand mods and bases and would not know how to use this system would need introductions. However, the system does not always need to be ""active"" and potentially new players could ignore it and use some sort of ""default"" setting, similar to how loot filters work.
* Links: Players will still want to trade for items with links and colours that they need.
* Uniques: Same as links, however by having a preference for specific bases there may be room for providing pseudo-targeted unique farming, making item rarity as a stat valuable.
* Selling the ""best items"": People may want to choose to mods that fit the current meta and sell items associated with that to efficiently farm currency, the idea however with the system is players don't feel the need to buy items they want if they can farm it, but this problem will likely exist.
* Maps and currencies: Trading for these items especially in bulk is awful and this would not change that.



TL;DR: Players should be able to select item bases and mods they want to drop, while nerfing the number of rares that do drop, to make items meaningful to the specific player and their build's current needs.",6,1585615344,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs301e/we_dont_need_an_auction_house_we_need_a/,pathofexile,1

fs2jhv,anotherthrowawaykek,trading improvement idea: the marketplace,"Seeing the disaster that trading is and how it gets worse and worse every league, I thought of a scenario that checks all the boxes both for GGG and the players, and that scenario is the marketplace. 


The idea is that you can create a shop and sell your stuff in a marketplace. A marketplace has a limit of 20-30 shops and a limit of 20-30 players visiting it at the same time (i don't know the game engine's limitations, imagine the marketplace as oriath where instead of selling your loot to lani and lily, you buy stuff from other players). New instances for marketplaces are generated when people login and their shops are replaced when they log off. 


The seller doesn't need to be at the shop, you just mind  your own business, doing maps and playing the game.


The buyer who finds an item on the trading site can get an invitation/portal that takes him to the corresponding marketplace. Here, he needs to actually walk to the correct shop and buy the desired item. He also has the option of looking around at the other available shops, while other players will also do the same looking for their own items (your usual oriath experience, but instead people go here to buy stuff). 


This way a lot of issues can be solved not to mention new opportunities to sell cosmetics (everyone wants to pimp their shop and attract more customers). Bots will have trouble navigating this marketplace depending each shop's position, you can limit how fast a player can trade by making the marketplace larger thus taking more time to walk around (this is useful for people who want to create a monopoly on something and then pricefix, instabuying everything new on the market), not to mention a new experience, seeing areas swarming with people ever time you wanna buy something will make the game feel more alive and more like an mmo instead of a single player RPG. I really like this idea and I think is one of the few options where trading can be fixed without any compromise on GGGs trading ideas.",5,1585613680,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs2jhv/trading_improvement_idea_the_marketplace/,pathofexile,1

fs2cv5,Orlyi,Mid season nerfs SUCK.,"So, here I am having a decent league playing VD Spellslinger. Made a good bit of currency and pretty happy with my build. Day 2-3 of the league I hear about the Aura stacking going on with Purposeful Harbinger and think... that's pretty broken, and if they nerf it, it will be in the next few days.

Couple days go by and I'm still liking my build, but as I progress and juice my maps more the latency and framerate associated with the build begin to hamper my enjoyment.

Then Bex says purposeful harbinger won't be nerfed and the prices of everything skyrocket.  I can't even roll beyond on my maps anywhere near prime-time without having unplayable latency spikes (only have this problem with VD since 3.10)

So I figure I've got about 100 EX if I liquidate my gear. with this I can get in on the Purposeful Harbinger train. I did this YESTERDAY. Today I read its being nerfed mid - league. All the equipment I bought, ALL my accumulated wealth is now worth 1/16th of what it was when I bought it IF i can even sell it.

Shame on me for playing a broken build, but I figured ""If you can't beat them, join them.""

I hesitate to say this next part because I don't want it to sound like a threat and not an honest piece of feedback. The league will end for me when Purposeful Harbinger is fixed. Not because I don't think it should be because IT SHOULD BE, however I trusted Bex, and I got burnt.

fs1m5w,stropi,Just a reminder that it was possible for a few leagues to be 100% immune to all damage. There might be more important stuff to work on right now than auras seeing the bad state of many things.,"Do you know why current resists are hard capped at 90% ? In case you didn't know, back then in both Breach &amp; Incursion league you could reach 100% resistance to everything. Not a single thing could damage you. I only remember these two leagues (that were 1 year and a half appart so I wouldn't be surprised if it affected a few leagues in between as well).

[Incursion league damage immune build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxYcRsMxqtU)   

Don't get me wrong, things like black cane etc shouldn't be considered auras and it is indeed a bug. But to everyone jumping the gun on auras and stuff like purposeful harbinger clusters should be fixed right now in the middle of the league, you clearly have no idea what happened during previous leagues and how some stuff was way way way more broken. For even cheaper. And didn't get nerfed till way later.   

Not only that, but the fact many players still have really poor performance, the fact that sirus is a huge mess or the fact trade APIs are completly fucked among many other serious issues, I really think this subreddit could use its energy for anything else than crying about auras that'll be nerfed in 2 months anyway.",17,1585610306,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fs1m5w/just_a_reminder_that_it_was_possible_for_a_few/,pathofexile,1

Builds online usually pair it with Winter Orb and CwC, but I feel like it's not good enough. I don't know, maybe I never invested enough currency to make it viable as I usually only manage to amass a few ex each league.  
This league there's a lot of I.S. + Cyclone in [poe.ninja](https://poe.ninja) and a few daring outliers using totems, mines and winter orb. I know it's kind of hard to pair it with something that allows for some form of map clearing, but, couldn't it be paired with (as an example) a bunch of ice golems? Could something like that actually work?  
All in all, I am really deep in the dark here, making a build even if it's based on existing ones, feels so daunting.

fs024q,Austiclees,Doing my part to occupy bot's time,"I had 3 Wraithlord Bone Circlet's for sale for 1c each; nothing special.  Then out of nowhere I got spammed at least 50 times for people that want to buy them.  Being generally curious, I asked them who made a build recently to make these things fly off the shelves.  I refused to sell to anyone that wouldn't reply.  Guess what.. no one replied.  After a while, I got tired of the spam and set the price up to 5c.  Well, here we are about 2 hours later and I'm still getting spammed for the 1c price.  

&amp;#x200B;

I started inviting them all to my party and copy pasta ""reply to me or you're a bot.""  I just kept on leveling my new toon and let them sit in my ho.  They stay for about 5 minutes, and then just leave.  Unfortunately, I cannot invite them all, as my party stays permanently full with them.  As soon as one leave, a new one joins to play the sit in my HO game.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, here's what I find absolutely fascinating.. they are all level 75 to 77 Necromancers.  Like, wtf?  literally every single one that has joined my HO party have been this, without a single deviation.  Also, all of their names are just slamming on the keyboard, which is to be expected.

&amp;#x200B;

Question 1:  Why this helm?  Why now?  Price-fixing a 1c item?

Question 2:  Why all Necromancers?

Question 3: Why waste time leveling them?

frwrmv,Malokyte,"The problem I have with Delirium isn't the difficulty, but its clarity conveying the difficulty.","TL;DR: Delirium isn't clear on when, or by how much, content scales up. It is also not clear in expressing how difficulty compares across content. As such, for me at least, it creates an uncertainty paralysis when participating in the content that burns me out faster. Implementing a previously mentioned feature by GGG, an indicator that states how deep into the Delirium you are, would immediately solve the ""when"" on difficulty scaling, and provide a baseline to start comparing content difficulty. This would solve most of the problems surrounding this league's difficulty scaling by telegraphing more information about the content for the player to make judgement on.

&amp;#x200B;

I've generally been burned out by the league at this point, and it's been hard to put my finger on why. The content isn't mechanically boring. I just have this frustration with doing league content that I couldn't pinpoint. I struggle with it occasionally, but I struggled with a lot of previous leagues' content and still played through 2/3rds or more of those leagues. So why was I getting burned out twice as fast? So I looked back at previous leagues I played and remembered there was one other league in recent memory I burned out fast on because of the league content, and it was Synthesis.

Drawing parallels between them, it made me realize that the problems I have with this league is that I don't know how much and in what ways the league content is scaling, so when I struggle against it I can't pinpoint why other than some vague generalization. I feel lost trying to participate in the content, and it makes me frustrated. I don't understand why I hit a wall sometimes, so I feel reluctant to expend resources to try to climb it, since I don't even know where that wall is, let alone how high it might be, so I don't know if those resources would be better spent elsewhere. 

As such, I feel doubly like I'm missing out on content, since the readily available content feels inconsistent in difficulty, and the later game content like Simulacrum and Delirium maps feel too risky to run since I can't evaluate if I can even run either of them safely, let alone profitably. It creates the same uncertainty paralysis I experienced with Synthesis, which makes me not want to participate at all. And, unfortunately, this uncertainty that I experience from Delirium is currently worse than Synthesis.

The uncertainty I got from Synthesis was because the systems were overly complicated. The information was available, I just didn't have the time or inclination to learn about it. The uncertainty was due to my own willful ignorance. In Delirium, while the systems causing the uncertainty are much more straightforward, the information about the systems are largely hidden. I don't know how much everything is scaling the deeper I go into the mist until I feel the scaling have a strong impact on progress. It's arguably worse than Synthesis because I could at least answer when I felt like the content would become problematic before I experienced it, even if I couldn't express why. In Delirium, I can't tell when it will happen, and I can only vaguely answer why. 

It's also a drastic shift away from other league content in expressing how something is scaling, either through stated information, or visually conveying that information. Metamorph told you outright what mods and moves your build-a-boss would have, even if you didn't know the strength of it you could at least narrow down what might be causing it and what to avoid. Blight telegraphed pathing, monster resistances, and boss spawns. Legion visually indicated what would spawn and where. Incursion states the rooms and mods affecting temple. Delve lists mine mods. Betrayal has a consistent baseline of member abilities and explains additional effects. Even Bestiary gives an approximation of beast strength through minimap UI. Delirium does not convey this type of information.

So how to solve it? Oddly enough, I believe GGG already has a solution, they just haven't prioritized rolling it out due to the problems surrounding the visual clarity of this league taking precedence. They had mentioned implementing an indicator that would tell you how far into the mist you had gone into, and I believe that indicator would be a simple solution to most of the problems with the mechanical clarity of Delirium. By having some metric to evaluate how deep into the mist you start struggling against content you can start quantifying, even roughly, where you start hitting a wall. This allows you to not just have better control over the league content through greater clarity of scaling, but start comparing difficulty scaling across content. If you can determine that Tier 10 rare maps at Delirium level 3 or something like that is comparable in difficulty to Tier 10 rare maps at 20% Deliriousness, then you can safely determine which league content to run without worrying about wasting resources, which makes content more accessible to players who do not make lots of currency. This way, while it doesn't necessarily explain how high the wall you're hitting is, you at least know it's there and don't need to run into it if you don't want to.

To summarize, Delirium suffers from a lack of conveying enough information about its difficulty scaling to give the players some control over said scaling. Not enough information is provided as to when and how the scaling occurs, which can lead to frustration due to hitting seemingly arbitrary walls while participating in content. Furthermore, this lack of information makes it near impossible to evaluate late game league content without running the content, as there is no metric to compare across league content, something that previous leagues and core content have been good at doing. Implementing a Delirium depth indicator would solve most of these problems by allowing the quantification of content difficulty, which would enable players to make educated judgement over controlling the content's difficulty, and allow players to extrapolate their performance in regular Delirium content to late game content such as the Simulacrum and Delirium maps, giving more player agency in managing difficulty scaling.",0,1585594574,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frwrmv/the_problem_i_have_with_delirium_isnt_the/,pathofexile,1

frvz5t,intangible_s,Herald and Aura Stacking is Killing the League (and medium cluster jewels),"GGG has commented that they would not be nerfing Purposeful Harbinger or Endbringer. I think this is a huge mistake.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's make a few rules here. First, we will not use the argument ""play the game however you want"" or ""don't worry about other people's builds."" Second, lets assume that the average player wants to use cluster jewels. And third, let's assume that this player wants to optimise their jewel/socket use.

&amp;nbsp;

Here lies the issue. Endbringer and Purposeful Harbinger are so staggeringly overpowered, players are drawn to using them. Except, maybe you don't want to use them? Instead you look at other jewels. Except, when you look at these jewels you think ""huh, 20% damage? 30% Damage? but with heralds i could get 100-125% damage!""  And the result is ""Wow, these other jewels are really bad! Let me try and fit Heralds in.""   And a final conclusion might be ""Heralds don't work for my build, but I don't want to use these other crappy jewels.""  ""Maybe I should switch to a herald build?""

&amp;nbsp;

With herald notables in the equation you are forced into this ugly cycle of comparisons and you are generally forced into a playstyle you don't want, in order to be competitive and feel like your build is good. (Again, see rule #1-#3.)

&amp;nbsp;

I'm sure there is some really awesome psychological stuff that could explain all this, but unfortunately I'm not qualified to speak on that.  

&amp;nbsp;

At the end of the day, it just feels shitty.  I've actually stopped playing several times when trying to make some cluster jewels work on non-herald builds because heralds are just so overpowered and I couldn't fit them into my build, or my build became too complicated that I didn't have the energy to play anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

Auras are the exact same issue, but luckily they are so ungodly expensive that the ""draw"" isn't so bad as Heralds.  But I imagine people in the higher tier probably have similar feelings for ultra tier builds except they are all probably running auras now.

frvyh3,hyperwheeze_,The good and bad of PoE,"Let me start this off right. I love GGG. I have played this game for almost 5 years and have accumulated around 4500 hours on it, and do not intend to stop any time soon. GGG is the most community involved company i have ever seen and it brings a smile to my face every time i see bex respond to even the smallest question on a reddit thread. This game tackles every aspect that i look for in a game perfectly. The character customization is so immense i still feel like i have only tackled a tenth of what this game has to offer. The skill selection is huge (though i wish it was a bit larger), and the whole ""Ascendancy"" thing just brings the customization to a whole new level. Now that ive outlined some of the big positives, let me touch on the negatives. Performance in this game is awful. Bottom line it is just horrible. I have a $1500 machine and i am lucky to get 90 FPS in my hideout. Some of my friends crash 10+ times a day, i have a guild of around 200+ people and a discord with about 300, all of which play path of exile, and the amount of complaints i get daily about server lag / fps lag (In betrayal still BTW) is immense. I could go on more about this but im sure GGG knows they need to fix something, nothing my complaints can really do on that end. Now let me focus on arguably the biggest problem in Path of Exile. Trading. The trade system at a base level makes some sense. List the item in trade chat (Lol ok GGG) or buy a premium tab and list it there. Someone PM's you for your item, you invite them, trade them, and go back to your business. Currently, after i sell an item, people continue to pm me for hours after its sold because the trade API or whatever it is is sooooo slow. I want to list my item in a tab, someone comes with the currency in their inventory, and purchases my item without me ever having to interract with them. Now i dont know the numbers that GGG has to pull in revenue yearly, and im sure stash tab sales helps immensely with reaching that number, but what if they SOLD the game. Imagine it wasnt free to play, but instead cost, lets say $15? which if im not wrong is about the price of a premium stash tab bundle. Im sure plenty of people are going to fire my ass up for this, but if i were to guess why GGG doesnt make the trading system less player interactive, my guess would be money. they need to make it somehow, but i feel like the game might be at that point where there are too many players for such a broken trade system, and selling the game might be the best plan of action unless they intend to change it. This is just my opinion, its backed up by my personal experiences and that is all. Leave your opinions below, id love to hear what more ""casual"" players have to say.

frvxkm,AmLier,F my bis chest due to server bug,"There is a sad story, a roller coaster of emotions.

Prologue: Playing selfmade stone golemancer, build includes such rarely used item as Cowl of...(reduced resists), focused on primordial eminences(quite high hp regen). I can't transition to cowl since league start since build required an two \~5ex worth rings to cap resists. And the problem isn't in moneys but that there is just no such rings on market. Also since start of the league I wear random 15c 6L corrupted chest, hence i decided to upgrade my chest first.

Action: Was looking for +1active gems &amp; t1 life recovery warlord chest, even bought cheap one. Wasn't able to link it and decided to look for +1\\t1 &amp; high life chest, annul and multimod it into spell dodge &amp; double resist. And then i had seen IT. The bis chest for my build: all mods I need, 95hp, linked, two 40+res mods, open prefix for spell dodge  for only 5ex... it was just... **I had to buy it** *i thought.* I was shot on moneys at that moment and offer 3ex to man. he doesn't answer anything, so i said him that if he willing to accept my offer - i'll be glad to hear it tomorrow and I left to sleep. 

Next morning I decided to sell 4ex chest from my alt to cover my shortage &amp; to add him to friends to see when he will be online. I sold my chest quite quickly, but adding to friends i had saw the message ""You cannot add as friend people who ignored you"" !@#$%\^ *\*what a very bad person\*.* shit. Okay then, gladly I have one friend who was still able to buy it and we start waiting. We have been waiting for 1.5 days before seller comes online. I was at work but hopefully my buddy was able to buy chest with only single crash during process. He put it into guild stash and I was happy about it. Really happy. And it was only 5ex for chest that i had to spend much more if I wish to craft it myself.

Then, half an hour ago my work day ends and I was login into the game, hovered mouse over my chest in guild stash, clicked it, transferred halfway to my inventory &amp; .... ""Disconnected: This action required authorization to apply""\~. Well, thought I, it' cannot be that bad, ggg is so good and I never able to lost items as long as it's already in my stash. I was login again. There was no chest on cursor or anywhere else . . .

F my bis chest. 

Also, unfortunately shadowplay turns out to be not working at that exact moment, so no video unfortunately. But there is [ss of chest in buddy's inventory](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/344500994333474817/694173773393559572/unknown.png) he sent me in discord

frvmz9,GodLame,"What would be the best craftable alternative to Voices, the Unique large cluster jewel ?","Newb here (it's my 2nd league).

I saw the hype building around Voices and Herald but i made the wrong decision to craft the medium jewels (heraldry, endbringer and purposeful harbringer) first instead of buying the large cluster jewel ASAP.

With my limited play time, 3 days later and 10 ex spent in crafting currency, i'm all set with 6 medium jewel with endbringer/purpo and 6 heral/purpo but the prices of voices went trough the roof, way over my budget.

I'm looking for pointers on how to make the build work with 3 Large Jewel with 2 slots as an Elementalist or Guardian. 

I looked over [\[POE 3.10\] Searchable new cluster notables list with descriptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r_cmwKmslsaZNv5I6pXxClB2XLIm5ii_5JdqdjLVAIw/edit#gid=0&amp;fvid=76517078) and [poedb](https://poedb.tw/us/mod.php?cn=BaseItemTypes&amp;an=Large+Cluster+Jewel) but i can't come up with a definitive choice. 

I was thinking of 4 jewels :

* 4x Vengeful Commander (Anger/Wrath/Hatred has 30% increased Aura Effect)
* 4 x 2 Jewel
* If affordable, an another good notable like -Resist

frvd52,jwexile,This Game Needs: Enchantment Orbs,"Right now the way the lab is set up, it’s rather hard to find the right enchantment you want on the right item. If you find a good helmet, you have to run the lab yourself x100 number of times to get your desired enchantments, if you run the lab for profit, you don’t know what enchant you’re going to end up with, so it’s luck of the draw on which helmets get which enchants. So you end up seeing helmets with the enchant you want, but it’s on the wrong item base.

The solution to this is to add enchantment orbs to the game. Right now you can seal a prophecy and trade it. You can buy beast orbs and capture beasts in them to trade to others. If there was a way to have an orb that you can place an enchantment in at the divine don’t, you can then trade that orb to another, who then clicks it to apply it to his desired item. Make it a currency type item that drops or is a reward from some treasure chest in the lab or trials of ascendency. They wouldn’t necessarily be easy to get. You would probably have to have “boot enchantment orbs”, “helmet enchantment orbs” or find a way to select this at the divine font.

I think this would give the lab a far more interesting dimension.",12,1585590159,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frvd52/this_game_needs_enchantment_orbs/,pathofexile,1

fruftw,Archangel_117,Why does trade suck? A PoE history lesson.,"I saw [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frq2uk/trading_is_an_absolute_fucking_nightmare_give_us/) recently and in the comments were many people who seemed to be relatively new, wondering why in the world no AH style system existed in PoE, or at least why so many of the frustrations that are present haven't been fixed in any number of simple ways. I can speak on this, as I have been playing since Closed Beta and I'm a bit of an econ hound myself (though far from the level of experience of many other veterans).


As a disclaimer, **I personally** would greatly benefit from the existence of an AH in PoE. I know how to use auction houses, and I know how emergent market forces work in game economies. If an AH were introduced in PoE, **I personally** would feel that my experience had improved. Keep this in mind as you read on.


First of all, the feelings of confusion/puzzlement over the lack of an easy-to-use exchange system are completely normal, given that most games that allow exchange of items between players don't seemingly arbitrarily hold back the smoothness of their own trade system. It is a perfectly legitimate question to wonder why in the world GGG haven't taken any number of simple steps to assuage so many of the frustrations that exist with the current trade system. I can explain.


GGG and Chris Wilson himself have made official statements (and a manifesto) about this issue over the years. Trade as it exists now wasn't always so, and when GGG made PoE, they carried over the player-to-player barter style economy from Diablo 2, PoE's spiritual predecessor. At the time this was a perfect fit, and made sense. Veterans of Diablo 2 had yet another dose of familiarity in this system, and the ARPG scene in general wasn't thick enough with entries for such a system to seem out of place to new players, since there wasn't much else to compare it to. MMO's had moved onto AH style exchanges and had been there a while, but APRG's were rooted in a different place, so the difference wasn't so stark across genres.


GGG and Chris Wilson wanted a game where players interacted with the game, and with their loot. The orb system exemplifies this, with many ways in which to interact with the items that you personally get as drops, modifying them and molding them to your build (which should also be unique, given the extensive customizability of the tree and such). Exchanges could be made between players, but in the original view of the game, should be rare enough such that the majority of what you use still comes from what you get yourself. The drop quantity and quality of items in the game was balanced around this very idea. A by-design efficient trade system would go directly against this idea and Chris has directly stated himself that GGG would have to nerf drops by as much as 75% in a world with an instant trade system.


So if this is the case, then how did we get where we are today? How did we go from players being seemingly satisfied with the old D2 style barter and small-scale trade system to people wanting an AH or bust now? Well, it all started with Premium Tabs. GGG wanted players to be able to show off their items in the forums, so they allowed Premium Tabs to display items in showcases on their website. Since this included the stats of the item, people now had a way to ""showcase"" their items for sale, rather than pride. Shops started popping up, with people sorting their items into categories on their forum threads. Programs like Procurement and Acquisition allowed searching of items that were publicly indexed, creating the first pseudo-auction-houses. Things progressed from here until eventually entire websites started combing the public API data and indexing every item that was in a publicly viewable Premium Tab. Then GGG realized that they had to offer a first-party option to these sites so they wouldn't have innumerable sources indexing from their API and slowing it down. This brings us to where we are today. But at every step, GGG was not ""advancing"" the mechanics of trade in PoE, they were *capitulating* to emergent player demand. They were only doing what they now *had* to do given what had already been done, and it all started with allowing items to be publicly indexed.


GGG never wanted people to economize and commoditize their items. Exchange was to be a rare and organic thing (player interaction) that would happen with the main focus not being on any raw currency value. This was built into the original design of PoE, having no actual currency system and all the orbs being of some actual use in-game. They didn't want a liquidity-based market from the start, and wanted the focus to be on characters and their items, with the occasional exchange if some melee found a good wand for their caster friend. Sure, players would be encountering items that they knew someone else might value, but the original idea of the game was such that a player wouldn't care enough to bother trying to realize the full value out of every item they got in loot, and the lack of an infrastructure for formal trade reinforced this. You weren't supposed to be ""able"" to commoditize your items, but the gameplay wasn't supposed to make you care enough to miss being able to. This design allowed GGG to create a more loot-heavy drop system, since the lack of liquid exchange would mean that players largely wouldn't be moving items around to their most efficient economic endpoints. GGG wanted to capture that magic of finding an item *yourself* that was an upgrade, and the lack of a liquid-exchange meant they could crank up the droprates to chase that magic.


Unfortunately, what we have now is a shit situation, and I don't envy GGG the position they are in. The game is fundamentally rooted in the above concepts. People obviously *will* extract value from their items if they can, and the economization of the game over time due to public indexing and the days of Procurement and Acquisition have caused players to start seeing certain orbs as currencies first, orbs second, something GGG never wanted. Increased trade efficiency means increased item flow, and because of the way markets work, that means more items landing in places where they are most efficient. This shifts the loot focus from one where you get your power from drops, to one where you get your power from the market. GGG's magic is in jeopardy here.


The lack of an exchange in modern times is GGG's grasp at retaining what magic they can. The more frustrating trade is, the less likely at any given turn that a player will utilize it. Even when players regularly trade to some degree, the amount of time it takes on an item-by-item basis means that they still won't be trading *as much* as they would if they could simply click a button (I know this because this is me, I'm a goblin through and through). GGG has essentially made the best of a bad situation, by making the worst of bad circumstances. They didn't specifically implement frustrations into their current trade system, but they aren't against taking advantage of the natural presence of such circumstances if it holds back hyper liquidity.


Many say that the playerbase for games like this (multiplayer RPG's in general) has moved on in the age of connectivity that we now live in and exchanges should be standard (I'm one of these people). However, despite my own views, I can certainly appreciate and sympathize with GGG's current situation, trying to hold on to the magic that was one of the cornerstones of the game in the first place.",334,1585587227,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fruftw/why_does_trade_suck_a_poe_history_lesson/,pathofexile,1

frtj08,AlfredsLoveSong,Just for fun: An idea for how ascendancies could work in Path of Exile 2 without the labyrinth.,"We know that PoE 2's campaign will do away with the lab and its trials. We also know that it will follow a seven act story structure, but GGG wants its length to be comparable to the original campaign so that players choose the leveling process that they find more fun, not the one that's shorter. Obviously they want to incentive the new content over the old, as it looks better for the game's public image. 

So here's my proposal: take a page out of the books of traditional MMOs by giving player-selected questlines in order to achieve ascension. These would be ""optional"" (insofar as you want an ascendancy), thematic questlines that are offered to the player at specific moments in the primary quest, depending on the actions that you initiate. 

In the way of an example, let's say that we begin the game as a witch. 

In act 1, we'll be offered a choice of which ascendancy the players wants to build an affinity toward. There are multiple issues simultaneously affecting Wraeclast, but there isn't enough time to engage in all of them and the player must make a choice. 

1) A crazed scientist has concocted pylons that aim to serve as a bridge between this world and another of mysterious origin. Something has gone wrong, and electrifying beasts from Esh's realm are pouring through the gates. Slay the beasts while standing near the pylons the squelch the invasion, but as a result of your proximity to the experiments, you feel something radiating through your veins...

2) A strange whisper is emanating from the dark recesses of a catacomb and haunting the citizens of (Act 1 town name here). Upon investigation, a mysterious book has been left upon an altar, blood oozing from binding. Like all good characters in horror movies do, you decide to read from this spooky book, out loud, which causes zombies and skeletons to erupt from their tombs and attack you. Once you've defeated the waves, you begin to wonder: Could I channel this new-found power to serve me? 

3) A curse has been placed on a pregnant citizen of (act 1 town) by a foul, malformed solitary witch who seeks control of the infant upon its birth. You offer to help by slaying the demon, but it came at a cost: that curse has been reflected onto you. It tingles in your fingers and courses through your being. You feel it hurting you...yet you can't help but like the feeling. 

_____

Once the choice has been, you've selected your ascendancy but do not receive any actual nodes in that ascendancy (maybe this first choice can be a passive point quest?). 

You'll be offered another choice questline in act 3, 5, 7 and in maps. Again, each of these will serve convey that you are attempting to exploit these newfound powers and grow them in unimaginable ways. The player's character should be actively seeking and growing these powers, and depending on the nodes that you want to get first, you'll run these quests in different orders. Some questlines don't open up until others have been completed first (what would normally be four/six point ascendancy nodes), while others are offered as early as act 3.

Theoretically, you might not even need to level lock these quests. Do them the same way that lab works (for example, normal lab will be level 33 no matter what, but I can run it as early as level 2 on a character with the requirements met), but require some stipulation to met for the questline to be offered. Killing cursed enemies, achieving a certain # of simultaneous summonings, inflicting # of elemental ailments. I'm not super keen on this, but it's an idea nonetheless. 

____

I don't really know what the point of all this is. I just wanted a break from my at-home work and the idea struck me. GGG likely already has an idea they're running with (that's way better than this) and this is all pointless. Not to mention the crazy amount of work this would take (~144 quests assuming each new ascendancy would have eight nodes...and the player would only experience 8 of these in a given playthrough). Just thought it'd be fun to explicate this thought.",5,1585584326,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frtj08/just_for_fun_an_idea_for_how_ascendancies_could/,pathofexile,1
frtizj,Remedyyyyy,I quit the league because of the aura stacking build,"So GGG says that they won't nerf the build because a lot of people have invested in it (and even way more since then). Yesterday I decided to quit the league because of it and I think I won't be the only one (but probably a minority compared to the people who might quit if they nerf the build). I just wanted to share some thoughts why the existence of this build made me quit the league even though I wanted to hit my first level 100 and play the whole duration of the league. 

\- The devaluation of my own build. Since the legacy league I haven't invested this much time into POE and my character. My build is (or was at this point) probably 100-150 exalts worth which feels kinda pointless now since it isn't even close as powerful as the aura stacking guardian especially counting the investment which frustrates me.

\- the change of economy. The value of my items are way lower now so I probably lose a lot of currency if I would switch the build. Not only is the price of the build relating items going through the roof but all other items are losing a lot of value. First it felt great to find my first Starforge ever but then realising that the value has dropped more than half in a couple of days made me feel quite bad.

\- Knowing such a build exists that crushes every content more than twice as fast as I do sucks out all the enjoyment I had this league. I don't mind having more powerful builds in POE and it is impossible to balance everything, but this is just too much.

&amp;#x200B;

So I just wanted to vent a little bit and show that there are two sides of the coin: some people (like me) quit the league because of such a build existing.",15,1585584325,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frtizj/i_quit_the_league_because_of_the_aura_stacking/,pathofexile,1

frtglj,v7af47OTy2F793X,"There's too much ""stuff"" in PoE now.","I suspect I will get flamed for this, but I am going ahead and posting anyway. Maybe people can point me to some good guides or give me information I need to understand some of this stuff.

I played PoE since 2013, I have thousands of hours in the game and I played it regularly up until around Breach League.

After the disaster that was Bestiary League, I took a break from the game and recently came back.

There is so much random stuff in the game now, and no matter what I do I just can't wrap my head around them all.

Atlas seems overly complicated, I still have no idea what I should be doing with it, or whether I'm doing stuff wrong and irreversibly damaging it in the process.

Syndicate is so strange, it doesn't even look like it should be in PoE, graphically it just doesn't fit and I still don't understand what I should be doing with it.

Delve just seems like an easy way to add never ending levels to the game easily. I don't know whether people even bother doing this? Do you get anything special for doing it or just more random loot?

The Menagerie is something I think the game could have done without. The Beastiary League was one of the most disappointing Leagues in the game, I don't think anyone really liked it. I gave up within the first few minutes of seeing what the game expected me to do. I feel the crafting via the Menagerie could have been added to the crafting table instead.

Currency used to be rather straight forward once you wrapped your head around them, but at this point they've added so much currency it's hard to know what is worth using and what isn't.

I still love the game, but it was at least coherent in end game back in the day. It just seems to be so convoluted at this point. Nothing in a game should be so hard to grasp that it requires hours of research just to understand it at a base level. I understand there may be some people who like this, but I also think a large number of people preferred the game how it was before a lot of this stuff was implemented.

I miss the days of just mapping and finding gear through that. I always thought the Diablo series was oversimplified, but in my opinion PoE has become far too complicated for the average returning player, even more so for the new player. I think the sweet spot is somewhere in between, a place that PoE used to fill before it got so convoluted.

## Update Notes:

This update contains the major economy update of the league and incorporates the new colors/icons/light into the filter. The latter is an ongoing process that isn't yet complete but as of this update the bulk of the work is done. With the large number of colors/icons to now choose from virtually every item type has its own icon with no overlap (i.e. stars only represent unique items now, links are now on pentagons instead of being shared with stars).

The most noteworthy major change of this update is that Uberstrict has finally started hiding trash uniques. The combination of easy magic map sustain even in HCSSF along with increased number of uniques dropping (via Delirium and other sources) has made this change somewhat inevitable. It's important to note that the list of hidden uniques is curated and takes care to only hide uniques with no shared bases and that are absolutely at the bottom of the value list as well as being rather common. Note that the default unique animation/effect will still play on these hidden uniques and cannot be disabled. Uniques that are very rare but are low value / bottom tier due to meta swings are still shown. In addition this block will always be OFF during leaguestart updates and enabled during the first update of the league once all new uniques are known (Raiz you can relax now).

Unique filtering has also changed a bit. Cyan star now represents Upper Variable Value (shared bases where at least 1 unique is very high value), brown star Variable Value, red star for jewels. The Prophecy purple border block has been retired as it's been useless since the day I put in it. The purple border from that block has been repurposed for a ""shared boss bases block"" - what this effectively means is that if you see a unique with a purple border it's because the only valuable unique on that base comes from a boss. So you can ignore it unless you've just killed a boss. This particular block has no icon associated with it.

Lastly, Perfidy appears to only drop in Simulacrum so I'm leaving unique Glorious Plate on the gloriously white background.

Important/notable changes:

- Large cluster jewels below 75 have reduced highlighting and no sound. Unfortunately it's impossible to filter by number of passives.
- White leather belts, coral rings, and 2-stat amulets now show in strict during levelling ranges for essence reasons
- Extended level at which general sounds early/leaguestart uniques until 77
- Regret and Scour orbs have swapped tiers
- Adjusted league-specific uniques. A few more bases (jade amulet, amber amulet) are now in the no-sound block but the no-sound block now always has the blue star minimap icon like the sounded block does. (reminder that the design goal is that if you see a blue star minimap icon but are in an area where no league specific uniques can drop, you can ignore it)
- Retiered unique maps
- Redid animate blocks
- Moved all oils up in value slightly, leading to Silver now having white bg and Verdant no longer being hidden in Uber
- Removed purple borders from rare chests in all filters, they now use 2nd tier borders at highest (blue)
- Resist shield bases now show during Strict levelling
- Resist shield rares now stop showing in Strict when red tier maps start, high HP base shields always show
- Added some more IDcraft checks for Talismans
- Uber now hides all talismans that don't pass IDcraft checks
- Uber now hides a large number of trash uniques


Icon/Color Changes:

- Map minimap icons now match the map tier color
- Influenced items and Atlas bases now use the new cross icon
- Catalysts, prophecies, and veiled items now use the new moon icon
- Oils and splinters now use the new raindrop icon
- Unique jewels now use cyan stars
- Incorporated the new colors, lights, and icons across the filter - numerous changes too many to list

Influenced highlighting adjustments:

- Increased highlighting 83+ elder bows and axes, moreso for siege axe and citadel bow
- Increased highlighting elder axes when 83+, moreso for siege axe
- i80+ Warlord HP base shields, i80+ Hunter quivers to semiwhite, broadheads to white
- All coral and unset influenced rings i80+ are on semiwhite now
- Moved shaper/elder heavy/leather to semiwhite
- Moved all 80+ influenced ring highlight to white border, the previous ""brighter color"" border was insufficient

Unique Tiering changes:

- HV to SV: Citrine Amulet, Colossal Tower Shield
- SV to bottom: Crusader Chainmail, Silken Hood, Short Bow, Soldier Gloves, Soldier Boots, Necromancer Silks, Sharktooth Arrow Quiver, Silk Slippers
- HV to max: Deerskin Gloves
- VV to UVV: Cloth Belt

Divination Tiering Changes:

- Betrayal from low to high
- Cheater from high to max
- Strategist mid to high

Minor stuff:

- Put higher tier delirium orbs on a slightly different highlight
- Fixed hidden bismuths making sounds in Strict during levelling ranges
- Reduced font size resist shields pre-A5 kitava
- Condensed map fragment section
- Added Mirrored False to all non-jewellery IDcraft blocks
- Adjusted tiers/highlighting for divine flasks in Strict (again)
- Some catchall blocks which missed the ""all levelling blocks end at 67"" treatment in the league launch update have now been forced to fall in line
- Simplified quiver levelling subsection of ranged levelling

frsmh8,blackfairy20,Help Defeating Sirius?,"Hi,

Can someone like help me with defeating Sirius? I am a summoner (Yeah you are probably thinking this fight should be brain dead using Summoner) and lvl 92 using Kay’s Spectre build with Enhanced Vaal Fallen. Damage wise, it shouldn’t be a problem.

Ok so AL5 came for my first Sirius. I went in blind (I don’t know any mechanics) and made it to phase 4 with like 1-2 portals left and died on this offscreen Beam (the big one not the “Die” one). I was pissed but I was like well I did not know mechanics so next time I will kill him for sure. I watched videos of it and so next time I know.

AL6, can’t even reach phase 4 for some reason always 1 shot me. I was pissed again because I am going to grind map again just to spawn him and learn again. This time, I do not have the corrupted blood gem immune so that is my fault so I went ahead and bought it. Also, I went ahead and bought Devouring Diadem Unique to try Eldrich Battery and MOM for more defense since before I am using speakers wreath helm that goes to my Arakali Fang for mapping (Though on bosses I do not use the arakaali fang dagger but ofc use a convoking wand with minion +1 and trigger socketed gem on skill). I do not even put a 3rd aura just to get more mana for more effective HP using MOM.

AL7, confident that I can beat him. NOPE! Cannot even reach phase 4 again. I have like 6.7k hp, with almost 1k ES and 500 mana still for MOM but these dude can 1 shot me still, I mean do mechanics? Yeah what mechanics can I do if its super-fast paced and 1 shot me. I have 75% elem res across and -18 chaos res. There is this skill that killed me multiple times, it’s like a AOE meteor (it is not the one where you need to get out of the circular maze since I know that). For some reason this AOE meteor has no cue and just fall on me and 1 shot me. I am like moving all the time just to make sure it will not hit or anything for that matter me since it is not a problem since I am a summoner but still manage to fall on me directly where I am at the exact location. I tried Bone offering for extra block too.

I saw youtube videos killing this guy and lol these guys take only like 10% to 25% of their hp while only having 5k hp and almost no ES. While I cannot even react with this 1 shot. Seems like my best attempt is when I yolo it my first time. I am almost at the point of giving up. Yah I know its only 3 times but it is damn frustrating. Never mind when I also try Elder, probably experience the same thing. And by the way each phase for me probably only last 10-15 sec with my spectre dps so you can see i have good damage but you can also see I cannot even manage to survive that long. After he comes down from chair, in about 10 sec or less I am dead.

frrh4l,viod__,Strange voice story lines,"I haven't seen a collection of the lines said by the Strange Voice during the story line (granted I haven't looked for it for too long), so I rerolled a char and went to every zone to open every mirror.

In the first 4 acts, it's only whispers and undiscernible things, voice lines that appear in chat started after killing Innocence in act 5.

I also collected a few of the lines I've seen in maps, but I'm still at 2 watchstones and likely won't see the endgame this league, so I rely on other people to collect those!

Another mildly interesting thing, if you open a portal in a zone where a god resides after killing the god, the line seems to be picked randomly among the lines used in maps. I haven't tested this out too much so it might not be entirely accurate.

Finally I've noticed two potential bugs:

* in the ossuary in act 5, the mirror was spawned near the end of the zone, where we pick up the item. Bug number  3 653 433 512
* in the ossuary in act 10, I couldn't find the mirror. I tried twice just to check, in both cases I couldn't find a mirror. Bug number  3 875 166 626

Here are the lines:

# Act 5

* slave pens: none
* control blocks: none
* oriath square: none
* templar courts: none
* chamber of innocence: none
* torched courts: Farewell Innocence, and hello, my agent of anarchy. It appears I've returned just in time for the party...
* ruined square: I know you can hear me, exile. You're not mad... not yet...
* reliquary: If only you knew what this place truly hides...
* ossuary: What magnificent monuments to mortal absurdity. Yet it is somehow... aspirational.
    * mirror spawned near the end of the zone, bug number 3 653 433 512
* cathedral rooftop: Flames and madness. I'm so glad I didn't miss the fun.

# Act 6

* twilight strand: One person's beginning is another's end. I wonder what your end will begin...
* coast: Death still crashes upon the sands. But who are these new inhabitants?
* tidal island: Feel compelled to stride beneath the waves? Perhaphs you should.
* mud flats: The God of War has reshaped this region. He's always been... unimaginative.
* karui fortress: Tukohama is expecting you... Don't keep him waiting.
* ridge: New paths lead to new nightmares.
* lower prison: Are you any more free than the bones trapped down here? Or are you caught in a prison of a different kind?
* prisoner's gate: The Soul Drinker... Abberath awaits...
* western forest: The Puppet Mistress is calling your name...
* riverways: Can you hear it, Exile? Madness approaches.
* wetlands: Life would be so much simpler if you accepted Ryslatha's offer...
* southern forest: Salt on the wind... The river sours. The King has returned.
* cavern of anger: Are you being led into a trap?
* beacon: He calls to you from beyond the horizon...
* brine king's reef: The Lord of Salt and Sea shall set you free... Well, your soul anyway.

# Act 7

* broken ridge: All these rotten rattlers were brought down by your hand. Will they return the favour?
* crossroads: It was madness which strangled this place. You can feel it, can't you?
* fellshrine ruins: Look what faith does. Ignore not this lesson.
* crypt: Noplace better to hide your heresy than right beneath the bishop's nose...
* chamber of sins level 1: Skill bound by logic built this grim sanctuary. Madness tore it down.
* maligaro's sanctum: Such magnificent talent. And you wish to ruin it...
* chamber of sins level 2: Deeper still, Exile. Deeper still.
* den: The walls are closing in...
* ashen fields:Ralakesh... My brother has been busy, hasn't he...
* northern forest: Can you feel it? Despair, thick as cloth.
* dread thicket: Gruthkul got a lot less fun after, you know, all her children died. Not my fault.
* causeway: Great work requires a touch of insanity.
* vaal city: An entire civilzation caught in a blood-hungry frenzy. What a delight it was to witness.
* temple of decay level 1: The Mother of Shadows makes herself known.
* temple of decay level 2: Nice of you to help rid Sin of his former lover. I'd have told him exactly where he could put such a request.

# Act 8

* sarn ramparts: What were such large walls trying to keep out? Or... keep in...?
* toxic conduits: Take a deep breath, Exile. That is the smell of civilised society.
* doedre's cesspool: Why do mortals insist on burying all the fun things?
* grand promenade: Parade your victories, hide your defeats. Mortals are so insecure.
* bath house: That little creep is near. How exciting.
* high gardens: Yugul, the silver terror. Now we shall see what you're made of, Exile.
* lunaris concourse: I'd not have wasted so much stone on these sisters.
* lunaris temple level 1: Lunaris was always the moody one.
* lunaris temple level 2: It wasn't hard to turn them against each other. A little nudge here and there. That's all it took.
* quay: My greatest regret is not being there to witness the bedlam that led to the state of this city.
* grain gate: Run through your tunnels, ugly little rat! Pick up your scraps! Beware of the cat!
* imperial fields: This looks like a lovely place to lay down and die, Exile.
* solaris temple level 1: Oh, this brings back memories. Solaris was not so gaudy when I knew her.
* solaris temple level 2: They used to be so close, you know... The Celestial Sisters.
* solaris concourse: Such grand monuments built to honour a petty hot-head.
* harbour bridge: You wish to fight the very skies themselves. Win or lose, this will be a pleasure to see.

# Act 9

* blood aqueduct: Take a sip. What's the worst that could happen?
* descent: You're quite the slaughterer. Should I be wary of you?
* vastiri desert: Savour the sand that stings your face. It is a reminder that I still let you live.
* oasis: Sin is sending you to slay his daughter now, too? You'd think he would be more upset...
* foothills: You cannot slay gods. Gods are immortal. Do you question what you are told?
* boiling lake: Why do you believe Sin can be trusted?
* tunnel: It was Sin's creation that brought about Wraeclast's ruin. We are simply here to restore it.
* quarry: Garukhan nests near. What I Wouldn't give to relive the halcyon days of ancient Keth, when we kept mortals in their rightful place.
* refinery: Technology is a poor substitute for power.
* belly of the beast: I will not miss this thing's strangling slumber.
* rotting core: The smell is bad, but the tenants are worse...

# Act 10

* cathedral rooftop: Once more into the bleeding heart of fury and depravity.
* ravaged square: You seek to end the madness, yet you were its herald. It was you who allowed Kitava's return.
* ossuary: mirror not found (bug 3 875 166 626)
* torched courts: Order is ephemeral. Chaos is the natural state of things.
* desecrated chambers: Nothing shatters sanity quite like blind faith.
* control blocks: Faith is born in the strangest of places.
* reliquary: Such fine trinkets show their true value in times of crisis.
* canals: Kitava will welcome you with open jaws.
* feeding trough: You walk through the corridors of madness and into the mouth of death itself. I do believe you have finally lost your mind.

# Maps

* Pleased with yourself? Feel all high and mighty, o powerful 'Godslayer?'
* With all the gods dead, I suppose I should turn my full attention to you. We shall see how far you can be pushed.
* You are the only one who matters.
* All suffering in this world stems from your actions.
* What will be the straw that finally breaks you? I will find it.
* The strength comes from within, and I know for a fact you are empty.
* You have experienced no real pain. That will soon change.
* The unrighteous will be turned to ash.
* Your life will end, and you will be forgotten.
* You are rotting from the inside out.
* You destroy that which you cannot control.
* Why don't you lay down your weapons and talk it over...?
* They are using you. Everyone is simply using you.
* This is all in your head.
* Everyone you have slain had a life, had a family. Your turn will come one day.

frr2nm,Elminister,[Suggestion] Merge some currencies,"Over the years as Path of Exile has evolved and amount of content in the game has reached obscene levels, I feel like it's time to make certain simple tasks less of a chore. Currency management has become more and more cumbersome over the years as each new league seems to introduce more and more new currencies. My suggestion is simple - merge some of the currencies that do similar things:

1. Merge Orb of Transmutation and Orb of Alteration - upgrades normal item into magic item or rerolls random mods on magic item.
2. Merge Orb of Chaos and Orb of Alchemy - upgrades normal item into rare item or rerolls random mods on rare item.
3. Merge Blacksmith's Whetstone and Armourer's Scrap -  improve the quality of a piece of armour or weapon.

Same could be done for few other currency types.

While these orbs have been around for a while and there's certain flavor to them, I feel like PoE has too much flavor these days and it's time to downsize certain things.",7,1585575981,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frr2nm/suggestion_merge_some_currencies/,pathofexile,1

&amp;#x200B;

We spent around 48.5 Ex in preparation for this project, but I'm super happy with the results!

**Notable drops:**

Nurses:58

Exalts:20

Unnatural Instinct:1

Cospri's:2

frqk68,Ackherst,"Want to slow the game back down GGG? Make intuitive, built-in trade offs for extreme-speed (not death effects)","I don't mean mob effects that ""counter"" fast characters. I mean literally built-into the game logic. Currently armour inherently reduces your movement speed - I think this is excellent because it is completely logical and intuitive.  In the same way, have an inherent &amp; intuitive penalty tied to extreme-speed. Examples:

&amp;#x200B;

When movement speed is above some base value (say 30%)  have a inherent, sliding penalty that starts at ""1% Less HP and ES"" and scales up to say ""25% Less HP &amp; ES"" when movement speed is huge.

For very high attack speed, have a sliding penalty for Less armour, evasion, block, dodge.

For very high cast speed, have a sliding penalty for Less mana and resists.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this would require some heavy re-balancing. POE 2 would be the perfect time to make this type of change. If there is concern that ""hidden"" penalties like this would hurt new players, then make it like Kitava's affliction - or whatever the POE 2 storyline equivalent is. Have them kick in after some event around level 30 and level 60 with a notification to make it obvious. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I think more trade-offs that are built-into the core mechanics (like armour = less move-speed) would be a brilliant way to bring more balance to the speed meta.

I love the game, but would enjoy it even more if it was more like it started years ago. Not slow, but not at the insane pace it currently is in either.",1,1585573996,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frqk68/want_to_slow_the_game_back_down_ggg_make/,pathofexile,1

frq2uk,PlusLiterature7,Trading is an absolute fucking nightmare. Give us real trading tabs.,"Whether you're using poe.trade or the official site, trading is a complete mess. It makes me *irrationally angry* even as someone who loves profiting from market inefficiencies and makes most of their currency that way. 

Let's go through the list of hoops any new player has to go through to even make mundane trade:

* Learn that the game doesn't have any auction house or any built-in trading system, really.
* Read about chat channels. Try your hand at #global and $trade messages. Get absolutely nowhere.
* Read about tools like the official site and poe.trade (bonus: stumble upon [""the list""](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/List_of_Path_of_Exile_related_websites) and nope the fuck out right then and there)
* Peruse offers and find one you can actually afford. 
* Message a guy who doesn't respond because he's in a map and a &lt;1/5/10/50 chaos trade isn't worth their time and/or portal*. Get confused because you don't know why he doesn't answer until days/weeks/months later when/if you start listing items yourself.
* Message 16 dudes out of frustration. 2 of them answer that the item was sold already. The rest don't answer.
* Get told that the community site you're using (poe.trade) is bad and that you're a noob.
* Finally get invited to a party, then get promptly kicked by the seller: ""Sorry, that one's sold already""
* Message a guy who finally instantly responds (woo!), invites to party and trades. Notice they're using only pre-made sentences and wonder if they're using a program for quick-chatting using hotkeys, or if you just gave currency to a bot.

At each of these little steps, a percentage of people give up. Even a massive portion of those that don't and decide to get a premium stash tab to sell items will eventually fall trap to:

* Market manipulation. Why the fuck are people allowed to put in offers and never fulfill them? This is done on almost all popular items to get people to list their items much lower than they're worth, buying up the supply from the naive folks for easy money. **Fake listing is a problem that vanishes by having a proper exchange.**
* Scams. As far as I'm concerned, few games actually care about banning scammers because ""YOu SHOuLD HavE bEeN mOre CArEFUL"", completely oblivious to the fact that this is victim blaming for an issue that thrives entirely because of the lack of consequences. **Scamming is a problem that vanishes by having a proper exchange.**
* Canceled offers and stacked invites. Because you need to spam 50 people to get to someone who isn't price fixing/can't be bothered to answer, you'll get no replies for a bit, then receive 5 party invites at once. So, someone messages you, you invite them 10 seconds later and it's either ""sorry, got one"" or they get in your party, chill there a few seconds, then leave without a word, never to be seen again.
* Massive delays. ""Hi I would like to buy your Glyph Stone Medium Cluster Jewel for 1 exa in Delirium"" -- even though that jewel was sold over an hour ago.

So, GGG, I don't care if you want us to buy superior timeless super-premium stash tabs to trade with others directly. This trading system is ass. It promotes the creation of bots. It's a breeding ground for scammers. It's convoluted, requires paying to really participate in, it's annoying even when everything goes well and it's insanely prone to having people corner the market.",917,1585572109,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frq2uk/trading_is_an_absolute_fucking_nightmare_give_us/,pathofexile,1

**Lootfilter**

Augs are 5:1c and alterations 4:1c. This means you should highlight those currencies in your lootfilter if you haven't already. If you are still doing chaos recipe, this means its more profitable to identify rares and sell them like that. Rare rings and amulets should also be visible as they are a fast way to gain more of this newly discovered valuable currency

**Crafting**

Medium Cluster jewels are king now. Purposeful+Heraldry will net you a few ex. Easiest way to get it is on 
*Minions deal 10% increased Damage while you are affected by a Herald* jewel beating out 
*10% increased Damage while affected by a Herald* jewels by about 30% higher chance to get this lucrative combo. 

Other medium cluster jewels should be vendored for a chance to get one of the lucrative ones by using 5 same rarity medium cluster jewels in hopes of getting a base of aforementioned jewels which sell for up to 50c at current time of writing

**Bosskilling**

Shaper is king again, at Solstice selling at 30ex+ at current time of writing. With fragments setting you back about 150c and guaranteed drop being worth ~70c it's a worthwhile gamble.

frp6i6,ionutMadalin,Sugestion on improving Sirus fight without making it easy," Hello, please hear me out on this.  
So lots of people complaining on Sirus beeing to hard ( most casual people, or players who just don\`t go meta and max block build). So they want to make Sirus easier, this will please them until the go one month in the league and have expensive builds that would melt a simplified Sirus. So what can you do to avoid Sirus being an easy boss and also make the fight accessible for non-meta build?  
Here is what I think would work:  


1. Make a icon of sirus on the minimap (just like delirium boss) so you can see when you might get offscreened)  
2. Add one more second between Sirus atacks, so we can chose on dps-ing or positionate better. ( sometimes I noticed that we are transitioning to a new atack I remain out of movement skill charges, or speed potion empty).  


I think this two suggestions would drastically improve this fight, because it would still be challenging and also you would need to have a maxed build in order to overcome. We just need to slow down a bit the fight not nerf the numbers.",2,1585568202,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frp6i6/sugestion_on_improving_sirus_fight_without_making/,pathofexile,1

frnfa4,demon-stom,Is scaling getting out of control?,"Last league I made a berserker with about 6k hp that would die to a wind blow. Understandably, he was quite fragile due to his berserker notable.

This league, I made a champion with perma fortity, took one fortify wheel, have 6k hp, 76% res and much more and I am absolutely immortal in regular maps. Delirious maps are another story.

Even in 60% delirious maps, stuff that would barely tickle you will downright almost one shot you. It seems like ridiculous design to me and goes what they said regarding hp scaling rather than damage scaling. But health scaling is also a problem of its own. I can clear regular t16 maps with my eyes closed. Bosses die in 2 seconds. I can insta phase uber elder.

t16 60% delirious maps? It takes quite a while just to kill a beyond boss and kosis takes quite a long time to kill (and rewards are so bad, but that's another story).

I won't even mention stuff that's mildly scary in regular maps will definitely one shot you in delirious maps (such as bameth if you have no chaos resistance). Ephij barely tickles in regular maps. In delirious maps, I can't outleech his lightning orb nova and I need to constantly pot up to offset his damage.

That's just my perspective from doing 60% t16 maps with absolutely no damage mods (I usually do at most one defensive mod like extra life, but I avoid damage mods completely, maybe except turbo but I need to pay extra attention). Even then, I end up dying couple of times in those maps, so I usually don't run these unless I leveled up recently.

Out of all previous leagues, this feels the closest to playing diablo 3 in high greater rifts where even regular monsters take forever to kill. It's no wonder everyone went to rerolling to quite literally the most broken build in poe history. The content kinda demands it and if you're like me and want to run the hardest possible content (which would probably be t16 100% delirious maps with double beyond), you would want to do just that. That being said, I don't have any intention on rerolling to harbinger stacking because I don't like playing spellcasters in arpgs, it's just not my style. I'll invest hundreds of exalts into my build to do that kind of content if necessary, but at that point, what's the point anymore? You can just level to 100 in delve/regular maps without using any hands.

One thing is certain. Path of exile wasn't made for this in the sense that performance gets atrociously bad if you stack too many monsters on the screen doing too much shit. I don't know what it would take for this game to run decent, while also keeping a decent resolution (without resolution scalling) and a good fps, but doing double beyond in delirious maps puts me at 5-20 fps at most and needless to say, my resolution gets scaled to as bad as [this](https://i.imgur.com/kjXGjPx.jpg).

frn3xo,Vinopous,First time HC - reflect - where?,"So I decided to play this league on Hardcore for the first time. I enjoy this mode more than I imagined, the amount of adrenaline rushes ive had from a game is unparalleled.

I think ive died 7 times so far and two of these have been from reflect (not as a mod on a map). When I played softcore I didnt contemplate my deaths much, just get some more HP and go next map, therefore I didnt know that there were other sources of reflect apart from map mods.

My first death was in Lab and my latest death, 10 min ago, was from the charging bull in racecourse map.

So my question is: what other sources of reflect except from map mods are there in the game? Do you have any tips or tricks to avoid the reflect from e.g. Lab? I died so fast both times I didnt have time to analyze my death, but maybe one source of reflect is treated like a curse and the situation can be solved with a immune to curse flask or something like that?

This league I played Softcore and traded everything. My goal was to to even see the Elder, Shaper, Awakener. I played a Shock Nova Crit Hierophant. 4K Life, 4K ES, 5K Mana with MoM, Arcane Cloak and 2.6 Mio DPS (all buffs, flasks) active. Pure dps from ingame (around 550.000) 

I could kill tier14 boss in a few seconds. 

When I arrived to the tier16 bosses they 
1) Instant one shooted me
2) I barely give damage to them, even after 3-4min hectic fight they still survived around 20%

Endgame stuff like Catarina, or Delirum map I could not finish either.

Why the hell did it make such difficult. 
Because of Corona I had a lot time last weeks, otherwise I could not invest that much time into Path of Exile. 

I am a bit sad with the outcome.

frmtuh,Gnorfindel,"I used to love melee, after this league i can never go back","This is going to be a bit of a rant, please bear with me.

I've been a regular since Betrayal, and most of the time i played melee builds because that was what i liked best in other ARPGs. My success with it was somewhat variable, and i thought that was mostly because i didn't understand Endgame gearing and optimisation well enough. (To be honest, that's prolly still the case.)  My forays into selfcast didn't go that much better either, but i could probably do better today.

This league i tried an ED/Contagion Trickster. I was told that bossing doesn't go too well with that, and my build is mostly lacking in cast speed and ES.

The game still feels so ridiculously easy compared to any build i've played before. I never realized just how fuxxored melee really was, but now i can compare. Even bosskilling, which is not exactly ED's forte, goes so much smoother, and i've never had so few deaths on the way to red maps. 

Something is seriously wrong with the balance of this whole game. Please do something, GGG.",13,1585555938,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frmtuh/i_used_to_love_melee_after_this_league_i_can/,pathofexile,1

frlyus,moglis,Farming for lab enchant is the most miserable gaming experience i have had,"Last time i tried farming my enchant, was back in Incursion for my Arc chain helm enchant. Took about a week but i finally got and told to myself never to run lab again. And here i am after a whole night of farming lab for my boots enchant. I though heck its a boot how long can it take. 200+ enchants later and from a lootable of 16 enchants i havent seen the one i want (i know they are weighted but still its around 1.x% to get it).

RNG is essence of arpgs, except the process here is worse than a boring 9 to 5 job. You are basically walking through traps slowing you, to reach a target over and over for hours. Theres no density to enjoy your build, the rewards are shit compared to mapping, theres traps that make you clip in weird ways when desyncing, theres no xp, theres a boss that gets instaphased but still continues attacking for 10s until he goes to switch, theres micromanaging buying offerings and twice enchanted prophecies blah blah blah. I can grind the same map for hours on end. After the first hour of lab farming i was almost nauseous. Took me 5-8mins on average to do the full run. I would rather have an enchant device at the end of each map with a 20min cooldown than this snoozefest that is labyrinth.

I think GGG are completely out of touch on some aspects of their game. I really wonder if the guy who thought of that enchant system has ever bothered with farming a certain helm enchant.

30% increased Lightning Damage

I would like to know how this interacts with shock effects not caused directly by the player, such as skitterbots and beacon of ruin.

frlljt,IndirectCell,Arcane Surge Spell Damage Confusion,"[Arcande Surge ingame](https://i.imgur.com/4ID7txh.png)

As i read it... i think i confused myself, hopefully you guys can clear it up.

    Gain Arcane Surge after spending a total of X manas with supported skill
    Arcane Surge Grants 11% more spell damage, 11% increased cast speed, and 0,5% mana regen
    Arcane Surge lasts 4 seconds
    Supported skills deals 11% more spell damage while you have arcane surge

But when i equip it i see no difference, it might be the spell im useing and that it has low damage as im still low level.

It says 22 to 44 cold damage down at my hot bar before equipping the gem in my weapon with a linked connection to the freezeing pulse spell im useing, i double checked it is a spell, but it doesnt have the duration tag if that is required for the damage added. Anyway ones the gem is equipped theres no change, i cant tell if im casting faster and i dont see any rise in 22-44 cold damage, it should be 24-48 i think, and 26-52 when the arcane surge triggers for that additional 11%.

Of corse again as i mentioned it might be that its only for duration spells, as i dont have one at the moment to test.",8,1585549249,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frlljt/arcane_surge_spell_damage_confusion/,pathofexile,1

![img](my6a4aql0rp41)

Bow was made with fossils. +1 str and +1 int gems are faceted-fossil-only mods. It sucks that +40% fire DOT and 80% fire damage are NOT craftable on bows. I realized when getting to the final steps of the craft. Minion damage works if I take spiritual aid. Socketing RF in this bow lets you have a LV 30 RF. The bow is already stronger than most similar-budget staff or dual wield sceptre options, but you can have a quiver on top of it.

Quiver was made using an awakening orb to guarantee the Fire DOT and +2 max fire res (hunter + warlord). If you craft ""cannot roll atk mods"", it's very easy to slam a life prefix and other cool mods like movement or AOE. Got pretty lucky, but I hope to craft another quiver to try to hit T1 life.",3,1585547860,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frlbhy/righteous_fire_bow_and_quiver/,pathofexile,1

frl8eh,SmiteVVhirl,"Trying to decide the best path forward with ascension for my dom blow Necro, MoM build or Commander of Darkness","Hello interwebs. Quarantine has allowed me to play some builds that might be a bit wonky but I really am enjoying them. This new build is Dominating Blow necromancer. I really love how the build is coming along but now I'm a bit stuck on where to proceed. I was leveling and generally enjoy using mom... that being said now that I have to make ascension choices i'm tempted to move away from my initial plan of using mom and stacking a decent number of auras (maybe 5?) on my character to power up my sentinels. One problem with that idea is that I was planning on going Brutality support which is great until I want to use elemental damage auras. I don't think a single aura is worth the ascendancy point... but maybe I should go into commander of darkness?

&amp;#x200B;

Do you guys think one is objectively better? MoM is more defensive but building into the auras is pretty great for damage/speed. Commander of Darkness would come at the cost of Essence Glutton, I would swap them one for one. The two big ascendancy points here for Dom Blow are Mindless Aggression and Unnatural Strength. This choice will also decide what I make my last ascendancy, Bone Barrier is better if I'm not using Arcane Cloak (which I currently am thanks to having so much mana) but if I stay mom my plan was to get Mistress of Sacrifice.",0,1585547406,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frl8eh/trying_to_decide_the_best_path_forward_with/,pathofexile,1

frkwp2,Adislash,Effects of unethical builds on game economy?,"For the sake of discussion, let's always specify if we're talking about softcore or hardcore.

I am a softcore player. I already feel like this league has become a ""play this build or miss out"" kind of league. Yes, we are talking about guardians with the purposeful harbinger.

Now, i wasn't around enough time to have played the previous op builds (HH self curse temp chain or something) so i didn't figure this out before it blew out of proportion. After you get the voices setup, you can complete the build with a skill of your choice there are plenty to choose from who get a lot of dmg with this build.
So you have no reason not to like the build, it might get boring but even playing it for a week and doing all endgame should net you enough currency to account for your next chars of this league. Even if i would want to do the build, it is just to expensive for a casual player like me who has at most 2h of gaming a day and some days i can't at all.

Since GGG said that it doesn't get nerfed this league, all i am hoping is that the economy doesn't feel as painful if a lot more of the playerbase can tackle all endgame content with this build thus, hopefully, creating more supply than demand and lesser efficient builds don't need a 1120402141 ex to get to the same level (at least dmg or defense wise, not both at the time).

Maybe if the same cluster jewel notable could stack a maximum of two times, that would make it balanced by not being as op as right now and not entirely inefficient compared to the tree unless it's a perfectly rolled jewel. But who am I to suggest balance changes.

Mid-league changes should be universal for all builds. Either don't change anything after the league release or do a balance patch after a month or so for everything. 

What then should I expect in future leagues? I have no idea if I should invest in an OP build because it may or may not get nerfed.

frierl,Vashtar_S,"Void Battery, Spellslinger Frostbolt/Ice Nova ?","Hi everyone, 

So I've been contemplating making a Void Battery-based build, but had no idea which spell to use (I do not want to use totems, mines or non-elemental skills like BV), so I looked at all the spells on which it could potentially be good/fun to play, and this one thing interested me, but I have no idea if it could actually be viable or not even worth trying. (I'm very bad with PoB so that's why I'm asking here, for the opinion of people who actually know how all of this works).

Basically, the idea is to use DW Void Batteries along with Precursor's Emblems, a +1 max power charges corruption, all +1 max power charges nodes on the tree with Occultist ascendancy to get 10+ max power charges, Kinetic Bolt as the wand attack or Power Siphon depending on whether I can make the PC sustain good or not, double curse on hit (most likely Frostbite/Assassin's mark) on the wand attack and maybe a third one somewhere, 3L Spellslinger Frostbolt setup and 6L Spellslinger Ice Nova setup (not sure which supports to use yet). Maybe go for low life ES with a Shavronne's if the build/my budget allows it. 

On paper, this might seem like a very strong combination, but since I've never made any complex build at all I'm not sure, or rather : I have no idea how this could turn out. 

Any thoughts ?",1,1585534726,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frierl/void_battery_spellslinger_frostboltice_nova/,pathofexile,1
friepf,Ormcrab,Requesting a sticky thread where people can post game breaking mechanics before the start of next league.,"Alright, so here's what I'm thinking; We should have a sticky post open a few days before every new league, possibly open it after patch notes are out.

This thread should be used by theorycrafters to point out severe flaws \_before\_ the league starts, so devs can take a glance there to see some highlighted flaws in a good format.

Add some strict rules to the thread:  
\* All posts need to point out an issue  
\* You need to explain how this issue can be abused  
\* Try to estimate the severity level of the issue  
\* Trolling in the thread enforces a 7 days ban  
\* If you don't understand how the issue can be abused, reply and tell the poster to explain instead of just downvoting

The reason for this is to prevent cases where someone sees a really broken feature and tries to get it fixed before leaguestart but end up getting massive downvotes so the thread dies, example of this can be seen in the link below posted 2 days before the start of the league and now here we are in a place where everyone is abusing purposeful harbinger for really gamebreaking effects.

friek9,Aglaranga,My 1st post ever (Narrative based feedback),"Just wanted to let GGG know that I've played Path of Exile since beta days and this league provided to me the most enjoyment I ever had in this game (second only to the Conqueror's expansion). 

The main reason, I'm a narrative/lore oriented player (""Explorer"", Bartle's taxonomy) and although I love tinkering with mechanics and builds as anyone does, for me they are only the means to achieve the end, the gist and sweet nectar of it all - the lore, the atmosphere, the narrative. 

So, I really wanted to encourage the developers to continue in this narrative building direction if possible, as much as possible and give my BIG thanks to the writers and whoever gave them the creative freedom to work their magic up!! Many, many, thanks! :)

...And some additional thoughts on this league's narrative structure. (The introduction of the trickster god). 

In my experience, this is one the most brilliant narrative designs ever implemented into POE.

The trickster commentator directly speaking through you but not as an actor-agent in the world but rather as a part of the environment, the environment-suffused narrator, fits in tremendously well with the conquerors going mad, the true nature and intention of other gods, opens up many lore questions (is ""Sin"" actually the ""Trickster""? :O ), and keeps me constantly engaged with endgame farming while I await to hear more from the ominous god-voice and the future it has in store for Wraeclast and my character. 

That being said, I do have a small critique. The mirror mechanic's implementation since level one makes little sense when viewed from the perspective of logically sequential story telling.  Narratively, it should not be strictly possible for the mirror-effect to enter into Wraeclast before the moment of Beast's death, as the Beast was the barrier which prevented the gods from entering into this earthly realm (from wherever their essence was slumbering) which also entails how and why they weren't able to manifest their powers. I understand how this was mitigated through the trickster-god's voice manifesting after Innocence's death but still there is this obvious (although perhaps small) misalignment between the mechanics and the narrative. 

Summed up, thank you for the wonderful narratives which make POE a far superior game than it ever was before. I am keeping my fingers crossed for the POE2 lore and immersive narratives as I extend my warmest thanks to the writers and creative directors!",1,1585534702,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/friek9/my_1st_post_ever_narrative_based_feedback/,pathofexile,1

If the div card is this low of a drop rate, is chancing my next best bet? I've gone through around 1k chance orbs so far.

Suppose I have isolated a single prefix on a rare item. From here, I'd like to add two more prefixes via the multi-crafting, then add the prefix lock. This brings me to 3 prefixes and 2 suffixes. From here, scouring deletes the multi-craft and the prefix lock so the item would be 3 prefixes, 0 suffixes, correct?

If this is true, could I hypothetically add another prefix lock and chaos orb spam to add more suffixes until I end up with two desirable ones?

I started playing POE 4 days ago. After finishing the 10th act, i watched a lot of videos to improve my knowledge on the game. I found out that the Atlas is the main thing to do after the acts.  


The fact is that i followed a guide in which the guy managed to reach the end of the atlas with a 50 chaos stuff. I'm confused because it means that he doesn't need to change his equipement and will complete the main part of the end game pretty quickly.  


I guess i'm wrong on some points so my questions are:

1) I don't really see in which ways we need to modify our stuff after having all res cap and pretty good rolls on items

2) Instead of the Atlas, which other contents should i do ?

frembr,Nutteria,Honest question - Can someone explain how splinter drop rate works,"This weekend I finally managed to get all the core stuff for my build to be viable in endgame maps.  


Result of 25 maps with tier 4 or above delirium reward level is as follows (these are all T13+) :  


Castle ruins - 7 to 10 on average  
Precinct - 3 - 5 splinters  
Waterways - 5 -7 splinters  
Hydra map (ran 2) - 1 and 0 splinters respectively  
Precinct with Eradicator Elder Guardian - 2 splinters  
Chateau - between 4 and 7 splinters. Two times it gave me 10+  
Port - 17 splinters (ran 1 only)  
Carcass - 6 splinters  
Lava lake - 3 splintes (rand 3 of them)  


At the same time I ran 18 beach maps T1 with sextants and got a TOTAL of 19 splinters. That is little more than 1 per map.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran 5 T7 40% delirium burial chamber maps and got a total of 19 splinters excluding the 10 splinter drops from the delirium bosses that spawned there.

freluv,Gheorghe_Gheorghe,Shields with melee,"Two handed weapons have alot of damage

Dual wielding gives 15% more damage alongside some attack speed and 15% chance to block 

Using a shield gives around 100-300 hp( maybe more ehp for es builds) and a bit more chance to block compared to dual wielding

300hp and 10-15% block chance is never going to be better to killing everything 15% faster, at most the defensive options are going to be as good as the boss simply dying faster and dealing less damage in total, but with the current speed meta the extra damage still is alot better

This is balanced by the mechanic of blocking a hit, the problem is, its not.

So using a shield for a melee character is simply not worth it over dual wielding unless the defensive capabilities of the shield are a fair trade to the superior firepower of dual wielding 

In the case of the gladiator ascendancy it is worth it through investment in the ascendancy  itself, giving the player a big boost to block chance and and spell block chance, which is currently unachievable anywhere else, which opens up the opportunity to cap the chance to block with a bit more investment in the passive tree, while still having good damage/ehp/clearspeed

So how do we solve this problem?

One solution could be reverting the chances made to spell blocking in the past
In the past, chance to block spell damage was gained through certain items granting a percentage of the chance to block attacks to also apply to spells. This was relatively recently changed to a flat chance to block spell damage, regardless of our chance to block attacks 

This change could be reverted, or at least keep some items/passive skills to work the old way, with lower percentages, while keeping the others working the new way

Another elegant solution could be to ignore block chance at all and make having a shield grant another defensive buff. But spellcaster I think are currently in a good spot regarding weapon usage, so we shouldn't buff shields for them too much. Something like ""10% reduced damage taken from melee hits"" could be a good solution, as melee character tend to take more melee hits, being up close to the enemy, while spell casters tend to be more in the back and take less hits. Ofcourse every shield base type could have something different, for example giving evasion type shields ""25% increased blind effect for melee hits"" and armor/energy shield type shields have ""20% of chance to block attack damage also applies to spell hits from enemies on your consecrated ground,10% chance to create consecrated ground around you when you block""

We dont even need a complicated buff to make slapping a shield on a melee build become a competition to dual wielding and two handers",3,1585520529,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/freluv/shields_with_melee/,pathofexile,1

frcqpu,evouga,Master Farming Analysis: the new system is a *buff* to the chance to find masters!,"I'm seeing a lot of posts concerned about master spawning, with players running hundreds of maps without finding a native Jun. I'm far from a GGG apologist, but I think that a lot of the concern is misplaced and due to misunderstandings about how master missions behave under the new atlas system.

**Tl;drs:**

* the main source of master missions starting in 3.9 is the map completion bonus, \*not\* native master spawns. Looking just at the native spawn rate is not useful or relevant.
* to farm a particular master (say, Jun), run maps, adding Jun or Zana to the map whenever possible. Your chance of encountering Jun each map is 9.0% at 0% awakening bonus and 11.2% at awakening bonus 150%.
* **even at 0% awakening bonus** you will encounter more Juns per map, on average, than under the old master mission system (where you had an 8.6% chance to encounter Jun each map).
* none of the above conclusions take into account the free daily master missions, sextants, prophecies, or free Conqueror maps, all of which give you additional opportunities to find Jun.

&amp;#x200B;

**The math:**

Let's say your awakening bonus is A%. Then your probability of receiving a master mission on completing a map is p = (35 + A/15)/100.

Let m be the fraction of maps you add a master to using the map device. The maximum sustainable value of m satisfies

m = p \* (1+m/5) + p\*(1-m)\*1/50,

where the right-hand side is the probability that you will get a master mission back from the map. There is a base p chance you get a mission back directly. A fraction m/5 of the maps you run will be Zana missions which also have probability p of giving you a mission. Finally, the second term accounts for a native Zana appearing in 2% of the (1-m)  fraction of maps you run without a map-device master, and the chance of receiving a bonus master mission in her map.

Now given m, we can calculate the chance of finding Jun while running a map:

j = \[m/5 + (1-m)/50\]\*(1+1/50).

A fraction m/5 of maps you explicitly force Jun; you also have a 2% chance of finding Jun natively on maps where you don't force a different master\[1\]. Finally, you have a 2% chance of finding Jun in Zana's map, whether because you forced Zana or she appeared natively.

Simplifying the above, the formula for the probability of finding Jun in a map is

51/50 \* (3A+2075) / (23425-3A)

when you have A% awakening bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

\[1\] You can \*very\* slightly increase your chance to find Jun by ignoring other non-Zana masters like Alva etc.",17,1585513949,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frcqpu/master_farming_analysis_the_new_system_is_a_buff/,pathofexile,8

Their AI is idiotic beyond comprehension. They are either cuckolding in the corner of the map, waiting to be slaughtered, or outright throw themselves in your path like stupid deer trying to cross the road in front of a semi.

Even when a huge amount of care is taken to carefully herd them towards the next mob pack, their possession triggers remain mysterious. They refuse to possess mobs after they take damage. They don't do it when given more than enough time - up to the point of letting them escape.

And when they finally decide that ""THIS IS THE MOMENT"", they often go for the crappiest white mob they can find - even when mobs of other rarities are available in the vicinity.

&amp;#x200B;

Come on. The gameplay mechanic is plain and simple - take care not to oneshot them, herd them through the packs of mobs, let them possess somebody - reap bigger rewards.

GGG, you were talking about slowing the game down - this is how you do it properly, not with shitty one-shot explosions in the mist and billion particle effects.

There are corresponding sextant modifiers. There is whole Alva's Temple room for these fuckers. But the whole system just falls apart because they are so idiotic.

Step 2: Complete most of the map then go into an Alva mission.

Step 3: Die to something, not sure if it's important what(In my case, I thought I could kill the incursion boss before he slammed me, I misjudged)

Step 4: Approach a separate Alva, but don't talk to her yet. She might have ! over her head

Step 5: Full clear map

Step 6: Try to do incursion only to find out she doesn't have the option to complete it at all, it seems like she didn't register that the original one finished.

frbusp,Synchrotr0n,Your old friends is back.,"Seriously, when is GGG going to take actions against RMT spamming? The spam is getting worse every league and it's already at a point where there's more spam messages than messages sent by real players in the chat.

I don't want to hear how difficult it is to fight against botting, because the strategy to counter spamming is not the same as the one to fight against currency-farming bots.

It would be trivial for GGG to create an account-wide flagging (similar to how we can permanently unlock Scion), which would enable new accounts to be able to send messages in the chat channel. This flagging would occur when the account met some kind of milestone (beating Merciless Lab for example), and then the owner of the account would be able to send messages in any chat channel. Those who didn't reach the milestone would still be able to read any channel, but to actually talk they would be restrict to chat channels number 1 to 100.

Yes, it would still be possible for botters to manually get their bots whitelisted to talk in chat, but considering how fast spam bots get banned it's just not feasible for them to waste so much time on something that will bring them so little benefit (that would only work for currency-farming bots that stay undetected for much longer).

I do recognize that this would have a negative impact on legitimate new players that joined PoE, but for an actual human, the task of beating Merciless Lab is quite simple even for an inexperienced player. Moreover, it's not right that the majority of the veteran players in this game have to suffer just because of a minority of new players can avoid a short, temporary restriction when trying to talk in chat channels.",5,1585510886,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/frbusp/your_old_friends_is_back/,pathofexile,0

But I just wanted to try another build/character. Don't like the way cyclone works tbh. Im literally wet paper while not spinning, which is kinda annoying if u want to loot.
And I feel like my boss dmg is pretty bad. Aoe is fine.

I just started delving and it's pretty fun for me. Especially till it's a good way to earn currency. At least for me.

So does anyone has a good recommendations for a build that is good at delving and good for the delirium thingy? I wouldn't mind to kill bosses relatively quick as well. But that shouldn't be my focus. If its can kill bosses faster than my cyclone I'm fine with it.

And I don't think I like evasion based builds. Tried one and just got oneshottet all the time. (probably because I didn't know enough about the stats and stuff).

And it shouldn't be too expansive to get started. Till I'm just a poor guy. Currently at 2ex and 500c (still got a lot of fossils to sell).

fr9slo,KaneDrakkonis,A serious (sirius) thread from someone new to the fight,"Been playing PoE since closed beta... blah blah the old days blah blah blah blah...

K thats done..

Fought many bosses in many incarnations, I didnt go super meta hardcore until legion honestly, and thats the first time I killed shaper, and elder, and even uber elder (cycloneleaguelol). 

Path of Exile to its credit  has been getting steadily better and more easily accessible for the most part once you understand the fundamentals of crafting and trading (Thank you Ziggy/Zizaran/Mathil etc) for providing the community at large for this.

To the main point ---

Just tried Sirius A4 for the first time, running a animate weapon necro with 16 weapons that can mow thru juiced sextanted awakened 3-4x delerium orbed maps and clear them (albeit a little slowly) have 5k life 1k es, bone armor, flasks etc etc.

Minions taunt and all that good stuff, surrounded by a wall of 75k hp taunting meatshield zombies and I dodge well...


So... who designed Sirius? A boss that literally you cannot attack for 95% of the fight while he floats in the air and does incomprehensible screen wide death storms, lazer beams, explosions burning ground, etc...

He seems to come down and be attackable for all of 3 seconds before, ooop hes up in the air again throwing bullshit attacks all over the screen (which you can largely not see) 

I mean... I cant even begin to describe the level of WTF orbiting my head (even after reading guides and watching videos) of how in the name of hell I am supposed to do this fight.

Shaper, elder, uber elder, the conquerors, atziri, map bosses, metamorphs... everything pretty much else is its own varying degree of difficulty.

Are you supposed to just... use a completely broken build and 1 phase/shot him out of existance this league? I didnt give much credit to all the SIRIZ IZ HARD posts until I experienced it myself and... yeah...

This is not how you design a boss. I get you want something ""challenging"" but the design philosophy seems to be turning towards ""lets give boss X number of invulnerable phases so the players have to dodge through absurd random BS mechanics because they do too much damage, also make those mechanics all nearly 1 shot the player because they have too much life/resists/etc"" kay...

sorry for the little rant, but its horribly disheartening to me to know now that I simply cant progress unless I embrace some meme cluster jewel build. 

No I am not playing a cycloner or melee, because ... no... not this league.",4,1585503705,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr9slo/a_serious_sirius_thread_from_someone_new_to_the/,pathofexile,0

I've combined a few builds I've seen into this one I'm running and have intentionally shaded more towards DPS with cluster jewels.

Are there significant gear upgrades I could make to this build (I have roughly 4ex only to invest)? Are there substantial changes to the tree I should make (have around 80 regret orbs)?

I've been playing saboteur for several seasons. Started with arc trapper in betrayal season, and played an arc miner in metamorph after the mine rework. Basically I feel that the two are identical. Sure, you wait for mobs to trigger the trap, while you denote mines. But with chain reaction and blastchain mines the two just feels identical, and DPS wise mine is way superior. 

It is really unfortunate time for trap lovers. I don't see the point of using trap now. Before the mine revision, you need to use ranged spell/attack like arc or GC for mines, because the mine drops near you, while you can throw traps to the mob. Now this difference is gone. I feel that GGG should either give trap some love, or just fully remove it from the game and evacuate some spots in the talent tree for other skills.",1,1585503453,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr9q2g/dear_ggg_either_totally_remove_trap_skill_from/,pathofexile,0

fr9ltb,Nutteria,Stacking cluster jewels should not be possible and it breaks the entire philosophy of the game,"Aura stacking, warcry stacking, double damage stacking, %ES/%Mana stacking, impale effect/reduced phys ress stacking, Unique cluster jewel stacking. Stacking, stacking, STACKING.

Every recommendation now is to stack cluster jewels. The entire passive tree has become a burdensome maze, where one needs to figure out the best way to get as many cluster jewel nodes as possible. The pool of available build items shrank so heavily the cost of exalts dropped from 130 to 105 chaos in a matter of days.  


At the same time the power creep became so big, people are making Siriuses per hit DPS builds, Mega Immortal builds, 200% IAS and 700% Phys dps perma stun/freeze builds. Headhunter and chase items? Who needs that shit. There is a 5 ex immortal build with 15 million damage.  


Items and loot? Who cares?! You need 4-5 abusable uniques and the rest can be whatever. Ress on gear? KEKW! Farm currency for the more expensive cluster variants with all res nodes.  


Itemisation barely matters. Crafting barely matters. Trading is a trickle (the site is not helping either) and on TOP of all this. If you dont play any of these super broken builds, your delirium loot will feel completely STUPID compared to the alternative. Happy with your 10 splinters, well the aura DPS guy has 50+ on average. Simulacrum feel tough and sweaty, just pay someone 2ex to clear it for you, 5-way legion style.  


This needs to STOP. NOW! I am not sure what are you watching and playing right now GGG but I 100% sure this was not the outcome you wanted.  


To make this even more concerning. You let this continue and the next league will have to be balanced around all these builds, making them the new meta and basically forcing you to spit on your entire game philosophy.  


I am not sure whether my opinion is unpopular or others feel the same way I do, but the reality is that with the current way these cluster jewels are implemented, the game feels stupidly broken, much MUCH more so than what it was in Synthesis.",23,1585503045,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr9ltb/stacking_cluster_jewels_should_not_be_possible/,pathofexile,6

Thank you everyone for your support and feedback! We had a lot of fun making this episode and we hope you enjoy it! Remember to thank GGG for working from home to keep PoE going for us while Covid-19 changes everyone's lives.

fr8hys,CaptainStronk,Announcing Path of Exile: Quarantine,"A highly contagious pathogen has spread throughout Wraeclast. As you progress through the story it becomes increasingly clear that something is amiss.

Our two week expansion contains the Quarantine temp league, the new Brewing system, new hideout activities and design options, powerful new map modifications and further improvements to the trade system.

During this temp league players will have the option to start new characters to trace the source of the pathogen. New enemies will be found in all area's, some of which have built a natural resistance to the pathogen. Players will occasionally find new items which can be brought back to their hideout to begin looking for a cure.

\- Trade improvements: Players will practice social distancing and now be able to trade from within the atlas, the labyrinth, as well as in the depths of the mine.

\- After recent updates to the map device, and in line with the theme of the league, NPC's will no longer visit your hideout. The crafting bench can be used to unveil items as well as dismantle unwanted items into basic currency. Similarly currency items can be dismantled into shards.

Introducing the **Hideout Farm** system:

Your hideout is the safest place in Wraeclast and the perfect location to experiment with the newly found items. In rare cases players will find seeds dropped from plants that have demonstrated a resistance to the pathogen. Einhar has prepared an area next to the menagerie for you to begin growing your crop. Plants grown to maturity will yield materials for the new Brewing system.

**Brewing** system: Players will be able to experiment with ingredients to create their own flasks. Flask mods will be uncovered by mixing ingredients from your farm and the flasks themselves will need to be refilled in your hideout after a number of uses. Will you brave the effects of the concoctions you create (or will you wait for ZiggyD to put out a guide)?

*Farm crops will function in a similar fashion to oils. Gold Tier ingredients could for example grant immunity to reflected damage when used in the brewing system. Fertilizers can drop alongside catalysts to speed up crop growth.*

\- New NPC voicelines: Einhar was heard to be muttering something about a particularly bad Rhoa soup recipe he experimented with...

\- Spellslinger support has been reworked to bring it in line with the recently released Archmage Support Gem (which Chris created after accidentally taking a double scoop of pre-workout supplement). Supported skills will now do 20% more spell damage.

\- Melee has been nerfed. All of it. So has conversion trap.",1,1585499112,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr8hys/announcing_path_of_exile_quarantine/,pathofexile,1

fr88ud,TheOutsideWindow,"Leveling isn't fun, why does it have to be that way?","Leveling feels unrewarding. There is so much stuff going on that by the time you finish it all, you are massively over-leveled for the area, but your gear is crap, and as a result, you do pathetic damage in the higher level areas that you should be in. You need to clear low level junk for more gear, but there is so much useless crap that you could gain another 3 levels by the time you are done. You're also poor while saving the world from their greatest demons, so casual crafting most of your gear is out of the question until around level 40-45. Because you can't craft many items, you spend way too much time looking for gear that you will be ready to vendor in another hour. 

If you try to skip this annoying circle of pain, the higher level areas your character is leveled up for are not balanced around this wild variance in damage due to gear inefficiencies, so you have moments while leveling where you just don't feel powerful at all and it takes 20 seconds to kill a rare with life regeneration. It's even more fun when there are timed mechanics in the area.

I've generally always disliked leveling in Path of Exile. I never found the game's campaign to be immersive enough for me to be engaged or actually care about what's going on in the world. Going from zero to hero just doesn't feel special. Leveling skills are very bland, I can hardly see Split Arrow on my screen, and Ground Slam just looks like salami dirt after a while.

Can we stop chasing anxiety filled dopamine rushes and have an experience again? Let's have things like crazy loot explosions at low levels, and tons of common crafting orbs so we can make all the crappy blues we need. Leveling should be fun, because we have to do it every league!",2,1585498185,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr88ud/leveling_isnt_fun_why_does_it_have_to_be_that_way/,pathofexile,1

More than half of the fight is waiting for clouds to move away (or Sirus to get closer to you) and the rest is waiting to die with random skill spams wishing it's not Corridor Blast at the first 3 phases before you are out of your portals.

I'm pulling myself back for a couple days from now not to create a thread about this piece of shit because i thought it's me being a noob but like i see other people and my friends complaining about the fight aswell. I don't know maybe it's still me being a noob but i just don't feel like i want to play the game anymore after because it feel like you are forcing yourself to face something very absurd.

Im looking for some help or advice to do with my Path of Building.

Ive had this issue on and off for a long time now. 

As far as I know, PoB is up to date, having used it a few days ago and checked it.

I always start up PoB through Administrator, the usual window opens up showing what files are loading in and then PoB window opens. Its just a black screen, and if you click anywhere on it, it then stops responding, and I have to close it via Task Manager.

There is no other version of PoB open in the Task Manager either. 

Sometimes it works, but on days like this I  cant get it to load up even if I restart the computer.

I have to redownload and install it as last resorts.

fr7vbk,Minisculptor,I love Delirium.,"I love it pre and post nerf, for different reasons. Yes, the visual clarity was needed, and based on the polish of it, i’m guessing they simply didn’t have time to get it out on release (Ahead of schedule doesn’t mean done, btw) The challenging, scaleable nature of the additional difficulty pre patch was fantastic. The clarity, unintended stacking ground effects being removed, excellent. Hear me out. For a long time, Deep Delves have been the only “aspirational content” in PoE. This is a design philosophy from MMO’s- creating content that perhaps only .1% of players will experience, but is a goal and challenge to work towards. Delirium, as advertised, effects almost every aspect of the game, scratching that challenge itch, but allowing you to interact with the mechanics of your choice.

fr5iam,Sunhallow,A discussion about the current viability of Winter orb and it's viability in future league's.,"Okay this might just be me being Biased alright. But I just want to vent my opinion and how I see it for the past 3 league’s.

But GGG why is it that the skill winter orb has had to be nerfed so hard that the viability of it is only possible with the current oversight of herald aura stacking.

In my eyes it’s unreasonable to even have this skill be nerfed as hard as it should be when the original investment of it was fairly high to even make the build work in high end gameplay in the first place. Especially with the new atlas which would limit the amount of eternity shrouds in the trade league which would turn it into a chase unique like your philosophy wants builds to have.

I’m just going to draw a comparison here with a few different skills and how they are doing in the past while in my eyes.

1. Blade Vortex : This skill has been a staple of the game for a few league’s now ever since badge of the brotherhood has been added the popularity of it has risen even higher than it was before. (note i only came back in betrayal after a long hiatus from talisman league (which is still one of my favourite’s so I don’t know how the skill was in between.) this skill can be played in a fair amount of different ways and all of them are equally strong ( although the Beeftain build is kinda death now as far as I can tell.)
2. Cyclone : It was hella strong in legion with its area getting to the size of the entire screen and it was a beast at single target as well. But even after it’s nerfs it is still strong with impale which is fine since you can scale the skill with a reasonable amount of investment and the size is toned down to actually be fairly balanced. Or you can go the facebreaker direction and do an unarmed build with cyclone which arguable is the strongest one you can do right now purely based on DPS the size of the cyclone is really not my style.
3. Tornado shot : It was nerfed after dominating bow builds for a good while and is now clearly outclassed by “Iceshot + barrage” or even the new perforate + split arrow which seems very interesting because of the new snipe helmet. But nonetheless you can still scale this with enough investment that is not going into the ludicrous point where you have to be a trade king to even come close to making the skill work.
4. Miners : Most of the mine builds can be heavily invested in and can do absurd amount of damage (although it think this is less of a mine problem and more of a low-life build problem which i will come back on in a bit). The main mines are not even the problem it’s the conversion of skills to mines that are just blatantly strong like Glacial cascade or Arc mines. (and that is fine in my opinion as long as it requires investment)
5. Herald of agony/Herald of purity : These builds can go to a ludicrous amount of DPS for the investment that requires it(although agony is pretty nerfed now a days and you are just better off with Purity). You can make a build that can beat the above named builds in dps with not even 1/10th of the investment. The downside to these builds is that they can be fairly slow (they are relaxing as hell to play and you are tanky as well which is pretty fun in my opinion for a change of pace compared to going zoom zoom. )

All 5 of these builds have some way of making them work or have been consistently strong the past league’s without getting any actual touches or are still strong after getting touched because of new mechanics.

Now we have Winter orb. A skill that was able to shine for 2 league’s then got gutted in such a way that it’s just nearly impossible to scale at all. It was a personal favourite of mine.

But the fact that we need to abuse a certain game mechanic to get even close to slight comparable dps with the aforementioned skills is ludicrous for me.

Over the last 2 league’s I have been PoBing Winter orb builds seeing if I can make it work some way or another and it never comes to even getting to the point where it is viable even with a stupid amount of gear that would cost 2-3 mirrors it could not even fix the skill. And I mean like perfected gear with double corrupts everywhere I got to maybe 1.5million while standing still and being squishy which is really not something you want.  why even bother having a skill like that in game.

The main issue for this is the change in 3.7 that made the cast speed of Winter orb 1.6 compared to the before 0.8 when you are moving. The stages of winter orb decreasing is fine that can be fixed with skill duration and solstice vigil(which is currently stupidly priced because of aura stacking). But the 1.6 projectile frequency completely fucked the skill over.

Now this league we have this clearly busted build because of cluster jewels which we all know is not going to be present in next league which is clearly good for the game to be removed. We can get to a ludicrous amount of dmg on certain skills with this. Like some people are PoBing RF builds that go well above 15+ million dps. And then we have winter orb. The best scaled version I have seen of this in this aura stacking bullshit is 8.5 million and requires more then a mirror of investment in total exalts. 

All I want to say in this post is if anyone of GGG reads this. When you fix this dumb as shit build that trivializes all content next league. Please for the love of god just look at winter orb and fix the skill. It’s not in a state where it’s clearly just a unusable skill because of the entire design behind it(yes I’m looking at you conversion trap) small amount of changes would fix it and make it playable for people. Without having to abuse a clearly unintended mechanic.

And if anyone has any suggestions of how to fix this skill just post it so we can at least show ggg we have slight idea's on how to fix it.

Sincerely a EX-winter orb player that is lost in builds every league now because nothing just feels right anymore after it got nerfed.

**Tldr;**

Why does a skill that was a fan favourite for 2 league’s have to be so gutted that the only way to make it viable is abusing a mechanic that was an oversight in a new system. While other skills have been left alone for ages or are still  viable after a nerf.",78,1585486680,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr5iam/a_discussion_about_the_current_viability_of/,pathofexile,1

fr529e,Th35tr1k3r,Reroll to Guardian or try to make elementalist work?,"Hey guys. The last days I bought and rolled a set of voices and herald jewels to try the buff effect stuff that is going around. I rolled an elementalist since I heard it should be good and pushed to maps and finished lab. I'm sitting at around lvl 80. The build is... Fun I guess?  Blade vortex, rampage, elusive and tailwind make me go real fast and I can clear even higher maps reasonably. But it only goes smoothly till I hit a bump like an extra beefy pack, delirium boss or the map boss and I just. Die. 
A big cause for that is obviously my tiny life pool. But it's not very easy to get much of that. 
I have neither a HH nor a solstice vigil and I don't think this character could farm those in its state. My stormbrand trickster is more reliable. 

So I was wondering: should I reroll to Guardian? I have a 6L shavs in my sale tab that I could use and the rest of the gear shouldn't be to hard to aquire. My question is: does guardian also go fast? Is it able to clear bosses without ridiculous investment or at least can hold up to a light breeze?

fr4l18,MasterZalm,Wicked Ward and Eldritch Battery,"I recently decided to look up and follow a guide for the first time in years, and saw the eldritch battery and wicked ward combo. Now I'm kinda confused about the combo.

Wicked ward makes ES recharge even if damaged recently, at the cost of regen and leech speed.

Edlritch Battery places your ES on your Mana, causing your skills that cost mana to be taken from ES instead of mana. This also lowers recharge.

I was under the assumption that Eldritch battery ES recharge didnt stop since casting spells was not considered 'damage' to the ES. It simply required a few seconds before recharge kicked in.

Mind you, it has been a long time since I actually used EB, as I dont normally play that way. Am I incorrect? Could someone explain to me the reason Wicked Ward is now on the tree, and used with EB?",4,1585481791,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr4l18/wicked_ward_and_eldritch_battery/,pathofexile,1

fr4kbk,galenorla,Path of Exile lacks weight.,"Reviewing the footage for PoE2, I had this constant feeling that something felt off. For all the graphics/gameplay imrpovements, one thing that I noticed hadn't changed was the lack of weight.

What do I mean by this? 
When the character gets hit by the giant bell in the Crowbell fight, or the twin-spirit nuke from Lachlann, the character freezes for a tiny fraction of a second and continues walking as if they didn't get chunked for 80% of their health.

In any game that aims for some measure of verisimilitude, I would expect the character to be knocked over, or sent flying when struck by something large and heavy. What you would expect to have a large impact on your character is represented only as a brief pause in animation and a lower life total.

When the player gets charged at by swarms of werewolves, instead of tackling, they stop running and slap the player with their claws. This just feels wrong. I would be much more scared of white mobs if they could rush me and tear me to shreds. 

GGG needs to introduce support for a system that allows enemies/players to get knocked down and knocked away. How great would if be if every fireball you chucked threw enemies to the ground as it exploded? Stun recovery would be a relevant mod again, and players would feel the weight of the world they are playing in.

As a side note, life energy shield have no visible impact on gameplay (until you die) unless you're constantly eyeing the corner of your screen. If GGG introduced a visual component to energy shield and life loss I think it would be a HUGE improvement. 

Imagine getting hit by an enemy while you have a large amount of energy shield, and seeing waves of white light ripple through a spherical barrier of energy that surrounds your character. Imagine that when your energy shield breaks, your character is stunned briefly as the arcane feedback causes you to lose your balance for a moment (stun duration scales with the size of the energy shield relative to your life to prevent getting stunned after losing your measly 7 es from your Facebreakers). How much more impactful would that be?

I'd love to see trails of blood running down my character's arms/armor when i get injured, and sprays of blood flying off me when I get hit by a devastating attack.

What do you guys think of how weight is represented in PoE?",9,1585481688,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr4kbk/path_of_exile_lacks_weight/,pathofexile,1

fr3ryq,electronicdr1p,Delirium thoughts from a long time returning player,"There's a lot of threads making really good points about what they don't like about Delirium and I think many of them are correct but there's a few other points I haven't seen brought up probably because most of the people just blow through content till later maps.  
  
The main thing is, Delirium feels GREAT while leveling. It adds a sense of urgency while still not really punishing you too bad for stopping to pick up items. As someone who hasn't experienced the last.... 10+ seasons of content, it was really fun to level with Delirium.   

That said, once I started mapping the problems became apparent. One of the biggest frustrations is seeming to not get more than 4 levels of Delirium completed. While I was leveling if I absolutely murdered a zone i'd hit 6 easily and 7 on occasion. Those moments felt REALLY GOOD. Then I hit end game and I'm never having those 6/7 completions again, it feels.... Really bad.   

Back when I played this game a lot (before the atlas) there was a lot of mechanics in the that made the game frustrating. I've always thought anyone who really loves PoE has to have some sort of masochistic side to them- however, the way Delirium currently functions, it ""takes the fun away"" the more you progress and introduces... A new level of punishment that just isn't fun any way you look at it.   
   
Anyway, I'm still enjoying the hell out of the game and having a blast exploring all of the new content/ qol features that have been added.

fr3pwh,OverGreenFish,POE is one of the most punishing games that i ever played,"To make it clear I do like hard games, i am a big fan of Dark Souls serie and i strongly believe that every game should be challenging in some way. 

Every challenging game have its own punishment mechanic and it makes gameplay much more intense. Some games have fairly low punishment for failure while other might even force you to start game from the beginning (yep i am referring to HC-like games).

Of course POE have HC mode as well but it is optional unlike the other punishment mechanic: limited portals.

* Failed to kill Sirus? Run another 20 maps and defeat another 4 conquiers.
* Failed to kill Shaper or Elder? Run another n maps and defead another 4 guardians.
* Failed to kill Uber Elder? Run another n \* 4 maps and defead another 16 guardians 2 Shapers and 2 Elders.

Do not get me wrong i do like to grind maps as every other POE player... Unless i am forced to grind it as a punishment for my failures.

I completely understand that players should not be allowed to farm endgame bosses for free. But why the heck even if player is not able to defeat boss he is still forced to make all pre sequences in order to respawn him?

When Uber Elder was introduced for the first time i spend like 5 sets of portals to defeat him. Although even then i was a bit annoyed that i had to spend currency in order to try again. But after endgame redesign it become much worse. 

It looks like entire system was made just to make players feel bad for their mistakes. And it is very effective, at least in my case. I do not even remember when i got so much negative emotions from the game due to not being able to kill a mere boss...

tl;dr: Portal system is bad i hope it will get revised in POE2.",14,1585476814,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr3pwh/poe_is_one_of_the_most_punishing_games_that_i/,pathofexile,1

fr3ckx,gobthepumper,"From backtracking to extremely long boss rpg invulnerability phases where the mist doesn't stop to rewards not changing if a boss was killed in mist, this league feel like it wasn't tested at all or thought out too much","In the trailer for the league one of selling points seemed to be that Delirium affects all bosses including Shaper/Elder ones.  GGG, have you ever fought an Elder fragment boss?  Because I just cannot believe that you have if you think there is ever enough time to kill them during Delirium.  The only possible way you might be able to kill an Elder boss affected by mist would be to immediately rush the boss room of a given map.  Now let's look at bosses like the one in the Palace map.  Good luck having the mist up with that insanely long RP or the Tower boss.  I am playing a 50 ex build that pretty much one shots everything while I run but boss invulnerability phases are way too OP.  I just don't get how someone could have possibly tested this.  

All you had to do was deck out a character in whatever build and make them clear a map occupied by an Elder boss/a boss with phases and it would have been crystal clear how bad Delirium works with them.  I don't really care about loot too much but 3 extra splinters or whatever for a boss killed in the mist is pretty boring, especially if it is a Conqueror or Shaper boss (the ones you can just barely get).

Then we get to backtracking.  While some changes were implemented, it just isn't enough and should have never been as bad as it was.  Syndicate encounters with mist are still awful if you want to actually make smart decisions.

Simulacrum is a pretty massive waste of 20-30 minutes.  The most valuable thing you get from it is probably a ton of scarabs but it is really hard to justify that time investment with just selling a simulacrum for 80ish chaos which is about how much you would make with an averagely lucky Simulacrum.

Honestly, I would love to see the league after next as something akin to Metamorph where it is very simple and GGG just works on revamping/fixing old content.  Maybe that is the plan with POE 2.  I hope it is because the clutter needs to be cleaned up.  Talisman may have been beaten hard lately so it goes without saying this absolutely needs to be either improved or removed.  

Delirium has/had a lot of potential and it isn't the worst shit ever in my opinion but it definitely is disappointing a lot of ways.

fr32ox,LittSalamiForKatten,We can't only have simple leagues with no timer.,"I get that the delirium timer feels more stressful than the others, but saying no timer ever while having previously communicated that you don't want complex leagues is a bit much. Not everyone plays the game as you guys do and just like GGG makes sure there's something in every league for all the different players (bossing, crafting, new items, new skills etc), every league cannot be tailored to your needs.

I enjoy complex leagues the most, and if there's a simple league I prefer it with a timer. I am 100% fine with there being some leagues like blight and metamorph where it feels like I am playing standard, but if that was every league I would not be playing this game anymore. Maybe there's other people who feel this way about all simple leagues, or all leagues with no timers. There needs to be variety in the leagues for different players not to get burnt out. 

There's a huge variety in preferences in the PoE community about all kinds of things. Some players love theory crafting builds in pob for hours, but for mapping they prefer just alch and go red maps with little thought. Some players love making spreadsheets and theory crafting endgame strats, but just play the same build every league. Some players will enjoy both types of theory crafting, some neither. This example just just one of the many, many preferences you could find in Poe players. 

Every type of player has an equal right to enjoy the game, and have some content tailored towards them. If a majority of the playerbase prefers something, it should obviously happen more often. But these requests of no timers ever are extreme and a sign that these people have no idea what is good for the game and are only interested in having GGG tailor the game purely to them.",37,1585472987,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr32ox/we_cant_only_have_simple_leagues_with_no_timer/,pathofexile,1

I can kill regular enemies 1hit no problem. They can't hurt me. Easy.

Delerium.. Oh wait. Can't kill them. They instant kill me. Fun.

Temple is can't kill fast enough, die. Fun.

fr0e7t,CynicDiscord,Thoughts on Delirium,"I feel like this league had so much potential to be good, which really sucks given how it turned out. It went from, on trailer, seeming like one of the most unique and interesting leagues in PoE's history to the worst in PoE's history in my opinion. There are a lot of (I would think, correct me if I'm wrong) relatively simple improvements that could help a lot.

Timer - I see why they choose not to remove the timer, as the point of the league mechanic outside of delirium orbs is figuring out how to clear the map fast enough to escape the timer. However, there are significant problems with the way it's currently implemented

* No reliance on mobs killed, meaning that in super juiced maps its easy to run out fast because mobs are clumped so closely together and they take more time to kill.
* Not stopping to allow for old mechanics to be used (They tried to fix this, and it made things like alva worthwhile, but some mechanics such as abyss it's very easy to end up backtracking out of the fog if your rng is bad.
* Partially fog issue, partially timer issue, but the inner circle in the mechanic that expands and clears out the fog is just bad design. It makes, I dare say, most map layouts feel awful to run with the league mechanic because clearing the map as it's supposed to be cleared results in delirium running out way before you can ever reach the boss.
* Speaking of bosses, in some maps with phased bosses it is almost impossible to kill the boss while under delirium. Complementing this issue is the fact that GGG's idea of making a boss that was once affected by delirium always have delirium as long as you reached it didn't make it into the final patch.
   * **Possible** solution - Make it work as the equivalent of a map wide incursion **with fog across entire map**. The two circles system is a bad idea imo, the outer circle sometimes doesn't spread fast enough and the inner circle can spread too fast making certain map layouts bad for the mechanic. Killing monsters increases the timer by however long (.25s/monster?) so you still have to clear fast and try hard to maintain the timer, but it's not total rng as to map layout, boss type, not running into old mechanics. I would keep the system as it is now as far as the change with zoning - the fog timer should not run out while in another zone.

Mob Design/Looting

* I don't think the nerf to monster hp was necessarily warranted, however I do think the monster damage in the beginning was overtuned (which is not just in this league by the way, but all of path of exile - see hunter maps that have hidden snake packs that instakill 7k ehp chars if you get unlucky). 
* On death effects make no sense. I've had this opinion for the longest time with this game. Why do so many monsters exist that are significantly more damaging and dangerous to the player after they've already died? This causes looting problems even after the visibility changes - now that we can see the on death effects, we have to waste precious time waiting for those on death effects to be gone so we can loot that exalt or doctor or chaos orb that just dropped in the middle of 10 explodey orbs or meteor showers. This fundamentally doesn't make sense with a mechanic forces players to run maps fast, as they have to slow down significantly or backtrack to gain their valuable loot. 
* They've been prevalent for a while, but in my experience with this league allies cannot die auras and to a lesser extent divine shrines have become an even bigger problem. How am I supposed to see in the middle of 100+ normal+delirium+beyond mobs where the single rare mob or totem with allies cannot die is? I've died more times than I can count to this in simulacrum. Not challenging gameplay mechanics, but forced difficulty in something that I can't possibly stop without getting lucky hitting the right mob. Why do these still exist in the game?
   * Solution - Don't add so many monsters with on death effects in the game. The ones we have (volatiles, bearers) are okay, easy to dodge, and actually make sense. Having them constantly while trying to loot doesn't make sense. Also, a gradual shift that I feel needs to be made in poe - scale down monster damage and scale up monster life. That way a proper build with defense can handle the same monsters that a glass cannon build can. When a 7k life champion can sometimes die a similar death to a 4k life shadow, what's the point of trying to build defense? **Make defense impactful, not just with 5 different layers like it is right now but with 1-2.**

This went on way longer than I first anticipated, but I wanted to share my input on the delirium situation. I think some of GGG's design choices make sense (hp increases, timer of some kind in non-delirium orb maps) but they need to rethink how these choices are actually implemented into the game and their rippling effects throughout the game structure.

TL;DR

Timer: 

* Make it rely on mobs killed, make fog across entire map until the timer is over
* Pause for league mechanics and boss fights, or at least let delirium on bosses with phases persist

Mob Design/Looting:

* HP nerfs not warranted, PoE would do well with increased monster hp and reduced monster damage to make enemies a bit more impactful
* On death effects often feel more unfair and obnoxious than actually skill-based, and prolong looting times
* Why do allies cannot die auras/divine shrines still exist?",6,1585458651,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr0e7t/thoughts_on_delirium/,pathofexile,1
fr0e77,Mattmxm,Why people do not like there being such an overpowered build.,"The most common argument people will use to defend it is that it ""doesn't effect your gameplay."" I agree it doesn't but it certainly hurts your mental. 

I believe the response by GGG to not nerf it isn't a good response and actually hurts more people than it helps according to them. (Although they could just reasonably nerf it instead of killing it completely). Lets say that 50% of people chose their build because it felt like the strongest build for what they intend to do this league. Over two weeks investment into that character only to have a build so grossly overpowered that you feel like you should reroll. 

Would you rather have the builds of a small amount of people affected nerfed or have a large portion of various classes/builds feel pointless to play in comparison to it. At the time GGG was aware of it, it may have only affected a handful of people, but now they gave the green-light for it, making people feel obligated to roll one. Why would you want to play with 99% focus when you can play more efficiently, faster, and easier than what you are currently doing. 

Most people defending it would respond to this by saying ""play what you enjoy instead of the meta,"" but you gotta understand how gimped some feel when there is something that reaches heights your build, however strong it may be, won't ever be able to reach.",24,1585458647,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fr0e77/why_people_do_not_like_there_being_such_an/,pathofexile,1

fr09g7,Drumbsy,Player proposal for delirium improvements for GGG,"1. GGG please make the map bosses incl. guardians and conquers stay in delirium state if you would reach them in time while in the fog.
Most of the time you don't have the time to kill fogged boss, because fog runs out. It feels frustrated. I would very much like to try kill existed bosses with Delirium features but most of the time you just can't do it in time - boss have a lot of HP, multiphases and etc.
Also we have a challenge to kill 500 map fogged bosses. Current count is like 20 in like 200 maps...
I don't feel going 500 white maps straight to the boss.

2. Add some extra 5-10 sec to fog or make it closer slightly slower if player kills in past 4 sec.
I hate backtracking the map, extra time to loot while progressing the fog will help a lot.

3. Add delay for fog while you encountered delirium bosses in the map ( red minimal icon ).

Guys if you feel the same please sign so GGG could see this.

&amp;#x200B;

Before you guys say anything.. i LOVE this game and no, its not just ME or my computer. I have an i7, 2080ti, 64gb of ram. Also, I've played this game on a 1070, 1080, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every single league there is a problem with FPS lag. Every league there is thousands of people talking about how poor this game runs on EVERY DIFFERENT COMPUTER SETUP no matter what your budget is. It's either server issues, or fps issues. Every league there are 100 fixes in the coming days/weeks that SUPPOSEDLY fix fps issues due to the ""new league mechanics"", but still never correct any issues. If I go and play softcore with no added mechanics I am sure it will run smoother.. but there will STILL be the spikes in FPS when the game is under load 100% of the time. Isn't it ridiculous how this is still an issue after so many years? One day someone will release a competent game and I don't think GGG realizes that. It feels like GGG has their heads so far up their asses at this point due to the success of this game that they continuously put performance, the most important aspect of a video game, on the back burner and just abuse the fact that people love to play their game so much that they will continue to play regardless of the dog shit fps/mechanical issues. Your game gets BOUGHT out by a massive CHINESE investor, and you STILL have the SAME issues? You are so greedy you can't redirect some of the \[i\]UPWARDS\[/i\]\[u\]\[/u\] OF 100 MILLION DOLLARS that you received from Chinese billionaires back into the game that made you those millions?

Like I said I am NOT a hater and I have thousands of hours in this game. I feel like im  just almost at that point now. Anyone else done with this fps/latency/mechanical BULLSHIT or is it just me?

fqyeu2,dobbstar13,Help progressing build,"Hi all.

I recently just started T13 maps (Currently have 14 watchstones with 2 left to get at 3 socketed watchstones) and my build is starting to fall off damage wise and die a fair bit (Probs about 1ce every 5 maps or so) I was looking for some help either progressing it or just straight up changing it

It might not be my gear that's letting me down, could be my play style and just not paying attention to map mods (excluding reflect phys). I find that delerium on maps where a conquer has infulence I can't really do them as there is just too many mobs and I'll usually die before my zombies can get in there and kill. I very rarely have zombies die but about 1ce in every 11 maps or so 1 or 2 zombies will die.

I have 3 ex and 320C (can probs get more if I sold more of my hoarder stash) and If I'm switching gear and selling my old gear here is a quick price check that I did Weapon 60c, helm 10c, neck 120c, Ring 1 60c ,ring 2 60-90c, Chest 50-80c, Gloves 5c, Belt 10-20c, boots 5c. total=410-480c

Here is my current character PoB :[https://pastebin.com/62ur907W](https://pastebin.com/62ur907W) I have my animate guardian's gear as a second set in the item section, I'm using 2 frenzy apes and 1 power charge ape there is also another belt I have sitting in my stash that I can swap to (currently unused in the item section).  My current playstyle is to pretty much keep up flasks and regular molten shell (about 7K for 7 seconds) cycloning every few seconds for the offering, and convocating in my minions into packs when they start falling behind. I also pop Vaal molten shell when I feel like I'm about to encounter something a bit tough (legion, map bosses, delerium bosses ect) and I get about 22K for 21 seconds. Then on bosses/rares I generally try and stay close enough to them to get them inside my Flesh and Stone aura so they are maimed.

I was following [https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2642810](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2642810) But from what I can see he only plays standard so I'm now taking his guide with a big grain of salt.

I do also have a stormbrand archmage that I leveled up to 75 and then kinda stopped playing him to focus on my necro [https://pastebin.com/mAn0iaPf](https://pastebin.com/mAn0iaPf) so I could swap back to him if you think currency is better invested there.

fqxgms,Illsonmedia,Animate Weapon is unplayable,"I am, for the first time, playing AW.

I am noticing a lot of ""feels bad"" clunkiness from it.  But that's fine.  Maybe there's ways to get around that and/or you just start getting comfortable with it.  That's kind of the fun part for me about PoE: This doesn't feel really strong; how can I build around it to make it better.   Therefore, I'll forego the clunkiness for now.

**Point #1**Outside of Clunkiness, there's a serious problem with AW, and it relates to entering new instances, especially given all the sub-zone mechanics that are currently present.

I think the best example is when you enter a Vaal Side Area:  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/568121274?t=05h21m46s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/568121274?t=05h21m46s).  Granted, Uber would have died regardless of whether his AW were up or not, (which leads me to ***point #2*** below) but the fact that he needs to recast all his AW in this side area, and then again when he leaves it, is just stupid.  Now I don't know how much of a coding nightmare this might be, but ideally, ""all active AW continue to the next zone with existing Duration remaining).

**Point #2**: What are the mobs targeting in this Uber clip?  I thought long ago they made it so that minions could not be targeted when entering a new instance?...  This is an unacceptable consequence of Summoner builds.  I notice it a lot when entering Incursion areas.  Even if you have just a Golem up, you'll get spammed with projectiles.  


*Edit: As a subnote, packs spawn way too close to vaal side area instance entrances. The linked clip above is a good example of ""too close"".  If you make all minions/allies/players invulnerable, then maybe it's fine, but otherwise it is a problem.*",8,1585446517,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqxgms/animate_weapon_is_unplayable/,pathofexile,1

The quest says that I should search Haewark Hamlet with at least 2 socketed watchstones to find her. But no luck.

I am mostly confused because in the past it look like as soon as I got conqueror anywhere, doing 3 maps would spawn a mission. I assumed there is no RNG if I will find conqueror spawn on an influenced map. Just do 3 maps and that's it. But this time it is different, I've run much more than 3 maps so far. Am I missing something? Is just RNG not fair to me today?

For some reason I haven't really seen people talking about this jewel for leveling before though. Now, I am still somewhat new to the game (I started playing halfway through metamorph) and I am sure there are much better options for leveling but I still think this jewel deserves some recognition.

fqw6q4,lunarwolf00,Fantastic Idea to integrate Delirium into core. Ideas?,"I fully understand that there will be a certain few who depend on them, but hear me out.  
I think while Delirium has an excellent premise now alot of things have been.. fixed (not everything),  
I applaud GGG for their work either way. I look forward to more performance patches etc.  
Meanwhile, I feel that integrating Delirium, it will be awkward lumping it into the endgame once again, IF it is kept of course.  
We have many ""rewards"" which are 4-links, potentially these could be replaced by Large cluster jewels later into the game, after releasing the trickster god, alike the other gods.  
By the time these are given as a reward, we have enough points to which we could build onward to, or refund to.  
Delirium has such as massive effect on the game, after a bit of fine tuning and balancing NOT GUTTING certain jewels, I feel that this expansion would be extremely beneficial for the long-term health as opposed to Synthesis. Even if Delirium itself was removed, just adding the Cluster jewels should be a long term benefit for customization, hopefully GGG goes more vertically building more on what we already had, like the betrayal and vaal expansions. (At their release, were absolutely amazing)

Upon further inspection, if GGG has a similar approach to how they handled the QOL with some of the features, Map device, end of wave drops etc etc. on their previous expansions I think alot of us would be very happy.  
I'd love to see more suggestions!",0,1585441769,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqw6q4/fantastic_idea_to_integrate_delirium_into_core/,pathofexile,1

I'm using a 3.10 necromancer build by Furty on  PoE Vault, but I'm unsure about a couple of things I don't see covered in the guide.

1) Should I be prioritising raw health or energy shield as a necromancer?

2) Am I better as a caster with wand/whatever best buffs my primary attack spell, or should I be aiming to use a physical weapon once I reach endgame mapping? If so, is there a specific physical weapon class I should use that best suits the necromancer playstyle?

3) Should I prioritise wearing light armour, or are there benefits that I'm overlooking in wearing heavier armour pieces like better resistances or complementary stats to this build type.

fqvjc5,streamermanbad,Can we put an ICD or at least improve visibility of zombie hands during delirium?,"Why has almost every single mechanic like homing explosions, artillery, etc, been adressed but this has not? This is hands down the most punishing mechanic once you start trying to juice up maps, and it widely has to do with RNG. There doesn't seem to be a cooldown on how often the zombie hands can spawn and slow you(the slow feels to be at least 90%?). Any time you stop moving in delirium-&gt;death. So why is this a thing?

I can understand counterplay if they spawn-&gt;use mobility to get out. However I have ran multiple maps where zombie hands spawn-&gt;dash out-&gt;another set spawns right under where I dashed-&gt;death.

On top of being basically invisible(grey zombie hands on grey mist over grey blobs and grey mobs? Thanks!), your life in t16 juiced maps with 4+ orbs is basically revolving around whether you get unlucky enough with RNG. You can't dodge it either like with artillery or missiles, as it's an instant slow.

Please GGG, either at least put in an ICD on spawn rates, or improve visibility. I think the homing missiles taking a second before exploding was an excellent change, why has that not been applied to this? I really enjoyed the recent delirium changes, but some things like this are lacking! The recent changes gave me some way to at least outplay most delirium mechanics and be rewarded for it, but this bullshit does not deserve to stay as is.",0,1585439400,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqvjc5/can_we_put_an_icd_or_at_least_improve_visibility/,pathofexile,0

Another thing I've noticed is that some people like to use bows with SoulRend, and I'm not sure if that is the route i should go going forward.

I'll turn off multi-threading (rip performance) and see what happens.

# Testing done

Opened a low-level area and started casting.

No problems when casting ""alone"" and not hitting anything. Waiting for brands to expire, recalling once, twice... all fine!

Killing monsters with ony storm brand (no recalling): no problem.

Killing monsters and recalling once max: no problem.

Recalling the same brand(s) more than once: weird log appears immediately.

**Maybe noteworhty:**

Sometimes there are more brands on the floor than the buff icon shows, like 4 active brands and about 3-6 ""dead"" ones. The reverse also happens, where the buff icon seems to register more brands than I can actually recall.

# Edit: Done some more testing

The log seems to appear when brands are recalled while they are attaching to enemies (in-flight) - possibly a weird interaction with the damage being enough to 1-hit enemies.",15,1585433224,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqtpsl/something_is_seriously_wrong_with_brand_recall/,pathofexile,1
fqtno6,KatCut2,Making Path of Exile more intuitive to new players with POE 2,"This game is extremly unnintuitive for new commers. I played this game for 2 years and i love to be challanged on things that are of my interest, that's why i think i stook around poe on my early days, because i was challanged all the time and didn't mind doing some research of my own. But most people aren't that way, most people just want o play a game to take off some stress they had during the day and just want to have fun, do not want to be frustaded much and really can't be botherd to research on a game they just discovered and haven't had a connection with yet, so they quit before they can have the knowlage to have fun with the game. I really hope ggg is going to focuse on making the early game much more intuitive and it's mechanics and introduse them gradually. If it makes the game seem a bit lackluster for  hardcore  players, due to lack of complexity, then hint em with greate complexity that is clearly not needed for the timebeeing for new players not to get overwhelmed. I know ggg is reworking a lot of the game in poe2 including rebalancing, old league mechanics and the skill tree, along with more things they didn't share with us yet.

fqt15z,Keyenn,Cry Wolf: Warcries will become your best frriends!,"Edit: Damn, this title typo is ugly :/

Hello, I wanted to do a guide about Cry Wolf, a New Notable from the jewel clusters. It's not a build guide per se, but I wanted to highlight a very strong and build defining notable, with very large applications and a lot of way to play it. It's also very, very well rounded as it will gives you a lot of increased damage, a lot of attack speed, and a lot of life regeneration.

I wanted to say it is not theorical at all, and I played it across multiple builds, among them:

\-A dominating blow Necromancer

\-A Gladiator bleed bow

\-A berserker Impale Bladestorm

First, what is cry wolf?

&gt;Cry Wolf  
&gt;  
&gt;30% increased Warcry DurationWarcries count as having 10 additional nearby Enemies30% increased Warcry Buff Effect

You are also getting a minimum of 15% warcry effect from the small passive (and you usually get one, so we will considere than 1 Cry wolf is also accompagned by 1 passive, for 45% war cry effect)

The first glance may say ""Meh..."". But you would be wrong! The heaviest mistake about cry wolf is considering it with only one exemplary. Yes, if you pick one cry wolf alone, it's shit. But you are always strongest in number! Indeed, cry wolf is a notable which effect is demultiplied with multiple exemplaries. Because it's giving base amount of enemies, AND war cry effectiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, let's pick the most obvious pick (and the core of the build, to be honest), Rallying cry. Rallying cry is giving 16% damage + 178% per 100 enemies around you. Without cry wolf, you would get 16% damage (well, you wouldn't get the buff is the first place, but for the calculation). With one cry wolf, you get 1.45\*(16\* + 0.1\*178) =49%

The first cry wolf is giving 33% damage. It sucks. Yeah, it's true, one Cry wolf sucks.

However, and that's where the magic appears, let's check how much damage the second cry wolf is giving:

1.9\*(16+0.2\*178)=98%

Wait, the second cry wolf is giving 49% damage, or one and a half as much of the first one? Yes, yes it does.

The third:

2.35\*(16+0.3\*178)=163% (+65% increased damage from this cry wolf alone)

The fourth

2.8\*(16+0.4\*178)=244% (+81% increased damage from this cry wolf alone)

The fifth

3.25\*(16+0.5\*178)=341% (+97% increased damage from this cry wolf alone)

The sixth

3.7\*(16+0.6\*178)=454% (+113% increased damage from this cry wolf alone)

Yeah, the last cry wolf is actually giving no less than 113% increased damage. Also, the most fun part about it is the fact it's global. Meaning that it increases everything you do. Yeah, including these physical or chaos explosion you do without a proper way to scale them 95% of the time. My bow bleed glad was doing 120% life damage per explosion. It's obviously overkill, but it's fun.

&amp;#x200B;

""Alright, cry wolf is giving a good amount of increased damage, what about it? It's still bad for the amount of point required!"".

If you had rallying cry alone, it would be true. However, you have a quite forgotten warcry, stackable with rallying cry, giving attack speed. I named Intimidating cry, from Farrul's Chase (you know, Aspect of the Cat boots).

&amp;#x200B;

The functionning is nearly the same. 10% attack speed, + 20% per one hundred enemies around you. It also intimidate for free, which is always great. With 6 cry wolf, you get no less than 3.7\*(10+0.6\*20)=81% attack speed. Permanently. (You get duration from cry wolf, and it's enough to chain it down).

So, we barely started, and we got already 454% increased damage and 81% attack speed. What else?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, you can also use a 3rd warcry, I named Enduring cry. While the effect per enemy is useless (well, you get your endurance charge cap immediately), enduring cry is greatly benefiting from warcry effect, to the point the regeneration become relevant. With the basic setup, you get no less than 1457 life per second for  2s, or a 3K heal on demand. It's like a great flask, but without charge, and giving you endurance charge on top of that. In a regular build, I get around 2000 hp/s and the duration is higher than the cooldown, so...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, we did break the interest of Cry wolf so far, but a lot of question remains. ""Damn, son, it's expensive, How can I get 6 clusters jewel while also getting my life nodes, my damage nodes, and all the rest"". Well, it's impossible, so you don't :D

A cry wolf build has to forgo every single damage node from the tree (well, you can afford for one if it's giving very specific stuff you can't find anywhere else), and get ONLY defense and life. The damage comes from Cry wolf + farrul anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, my Berserker impale tree:

[http://poeurl.com/cOZQ](http://poeurl.com/cOZQ)

Don't be fooled by the lack of impale nodes, or any dps node. The dps is over 15M, for a RT build. I still have 177% life from the tree, a decent amount of armor, a fortify buff, etc. If I prefer, I can get soul of Steel, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, to get 6 cry wolf, you have (had?) two options:

\-Two cluster jewels with two Voices. This option became extremely expensive recently due to Purpuseful harbringer. I wouldn't recommand it anyway, as it's not really superior to the second option, except for minions builds (and not all of them).

\-Three cluster jewels with two jewels each. The large clusters jewels have to be 8 passives. If you get great notable on it (for instance, Deep cut for an impale build, Tempered arrowhead for a bleed bow build, Blanketed snow for a cold build, etc), it's jackpot. Compared to a Voices setup, it's a bit more expensive in points, but it's also much stronger since you are not paying dozen points for zero stat.

&amp;#x200B;

You also have the third option, which is Voices x3 for 9x Cry wolf, but even before talking about the price, calcalations has shown that except if you are using 1pts voice (lol), 6 cry wolf is better if you invest the rest of the points into the small notables.

&amp;#x200B;

Because yes, once you have your 6 cry wolf, the insanity of the stuff doesn't stop here. Every single small passive is giving 15% warcry effectiveness. It means that EACH point is giving 3.3% attack speed, 18.42% increased damage, and 60 hp/s. And then... You can roll 25% small passive effectiveness on jewels so it's giving 25% more that.

Basically, Cry wolf is giving lot of damage, and is scaling very well the point you are throwing at it.

&amp;#x200B;

\-You are also getting a lot of mana regen from Rallying cry (usually between 60-75), which reduce the need for mana leech, or remove it altogether.

\-Since you get life regen from Enduring cry, you are not completely screwed on no leech map. The build also makes for a great delving build as you can go into the darkness easily.

\-You can also get a ton of side effect with cry wolf. Get a cry wolf + mob mentality, and you get Rage for free. Get Provocateur or warning call, and you get a lot of crit damage/crit chance. Etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, Cry wolf has also several cons:

\-You are screwed on no regen maps (no mana regen from rallying cry, no life regen from enduring cry)

\-You have to use two more active skills on your main bar, which can be difficult sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Battle cry or not battle cry?

Battle cry is making Warcries instant. It may seems like a no brainer and a ""I NEED IT"" choice, but it's not that simple. Instant battle cry are great, it's feeling great. However, it cut you from linking them with second wind. Because yeah, Battle cry with second wind is great, and it's also feeling great. Second wind allows you to cast two battle cry in a row, and given that Intimidating cry need you to have a charge up (else, it's skipped and you lose the buff) and will consume one when used, I would recommand the following:

\-For berserker, given the low cd of warcry, instant cast is feeling good enough. You can forgo second wind.

\-For anyone else, I would recommand second wind. However, given how long rallying cry lasts, it won't feel really clunky. The real problem is that you won't be able to instantly react with enduring cry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you liked this presentation, and you got ideas from it. While stacking cry wolf is not as powerful as purpuseful harbringer, it's giving a lot of stuff, and is actually balanced. It won't break the game, but can be included in a lot of builds.

By the way, Rallying cry and Intimidating cry are giving the buffs in AOE, so it also makes for a great supportive build.

&amp;#x200B;

fqt0oa,frostisgood,How to make some chaos orbs quite fast early on in the game,"I used to struggle with this all the time when I was first getting into PoE and found some good ways through YouTube, Google, Reddit and just my own playing experience.

So if you are a beginner and need to make some chaos orbs for your builds, I hope this helps.

The first way is through collecting **sets** of gear. That includes:

Double handed weapon/ one handed weapon and shield

Chest piece

Helmet

2 rings and an amulet

Boots

Gloves

Belt

Now once you have all these things you need to remember 2 very important things: all these items have to be **rare** and need to share at least one stat.

For example: if you watch a YouTube video or anything like that on the chas orb vendor recipe you’ll probably hear something like “resistance set” etc. What this means is that every item in the set you collected to sell has at least one stat that gives you resistance. And that goes for every other “_____ set”

Another important note to remember about these is that *identified sets give you 1 chaos orb* and *unidentified sets give you 2 chaos orbs*.

The second way is *Labyrinth* . Now that’s his one I found through my own play time. 

There are 2 ways of getting chaos from Labyrinths.

1. **The end reward chests**

When you finish a labyrinth and open the treasure chests, you have a chance of opening a “currency chest”. This chest won’t have any uniques or gems. But it will have a lot of currency. This can be orb of fusing, chromatics, orb of alteration, chaos orbs etc and if you are particularly lucky you will get an Exalted orb.

2.**Puzzles**

When you find and complete something like a 6 switch puzzle, once you complete it a door will open with a reward chest inside. These include gear, gems and currency. The most I got from these is 5 chaos and a few orbs of fusing but you will usually get 2-3 chaos orbs, and a bit of everything else: orb of fusing, alteration, chromatic, scroll of portal/wisdom, etc.

*I know it doesn’t sound like these methods are super profitable but if you are a beginning player, the target audience of this post, then these methods should be more than enough as your builds should include gear that usually cost 2-5 chaos each.*

Once you reach end game and finish the campaign then you can probably forget about these methods and just focus on mapping since that will be your main source of income then.

Also as a final note all the rewards listed above  from the labyrinth are from the very first labyrinth,The Normal Labyrinth. I cannot speak for the Cruel, Merciless and Uber Labyrinths but I assume that they would be more profitable.

Thank you for reading and hope this helps you.",13,1585431024,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqt0oa/how_to_make_some_chaos_orbs_quite_fast_early_on/,pathofexile,2

But in PoE, while it is told, that EM ""allows using more than a single core of your CPU"", it actually affects GPU too, so my tries to disable EM led to an about 40-60% framerate drop, depends on the scene. Ppls who have, for example, Intel processors, which have awesome single-core performance but are much less effective in multi-thread scenarios, potentially could use this function, because most of the modern processors with multithreading (aka ""logic cores"") are overpowered for gaming scenarios.  But they actually can not because it will shut down about at least ""half"" of your GPU.  
Take a look at screenshots.  


[The game just started. Look at the fps, frame time and the CPU and GPU load percentages and graphs. Also, a description of MT, as GGG imagines this to themselves.](https://preview.redd.it/8fn4topa7gp41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f22c2dc4b755f29c3dd837fa7386deeb482b263)

&amp;#x200B;

[MT OFF. CPU shows three times load drop, but GPU as well shows load drops down to 34&amp;#37; from almost 90&amp;#37;. Framerate also drops to 50+ from 120-150.](https://preview.redd.it/vaoidrbg4hp41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9681788a6efa99c44eacdd3d3cfd65336e9db27d)

[MT ON again. A load drop gap caused by MT OFF could be seen in the graphs.

fqs5cf,ArmaMalum,Policy Discussion (Part 1 - Leaks),"^(Foreword: To anyone considering posting *another* corona named item, it will be removed regardless of context. It was barely funny the first time, and far from it the 70th time. Now with that out of the way….)

Hey all!

First and foremost, we hope all of you are as safe and healthy as possible. Most of the mod team has had minor to major disruptions to their schedules over the last week, as I’m sure many of you can relate, which has caused disruptions in our moderating capabilities. We’re just about stable again and as such we wanted to talk about a number of things regarding the sub and how it’s handled.

###NOTE: We have a number of additional topics to cover, hence the ‘Part 1’. We are quite aware of strong opinions in other areas but please keep it to leaks for now!

##Our current policy

For those who don’t know, we’ve had a reactive policy for leaks. We’ve been largely spoiled (heh) with GGG’s decent lockdown on league info pre-release and *most* of the time there’s very few leaks. When there are multiple leaks, we make a spoiler-filtered megathread to consolidate/isolate them as a compromise between the spoiler/no-spoiler crowd. This has only been needed once in the past year.

If there’s simply one leak roaming around and we’re within 24 hours of launch, we tend to not bother with a megathread as leaks by nature can be unreliable and without new material, the megathread itself tends to get buried and defeats the purpose of the consolidation (people post the same leak because they don’t see the megathread and we remove the post anyway. There’s no functional change after an hour or two). A good example of this was for Exilecon. There was a single 4-5 second clip showing the revamped Lioneye’s Watch/Hillock roaming around. We stuck to removing that specific leak until more leaks popped up (which they did) and at that point we consolidated as normal.

##Why it’s not working anymore

In case you missed it, Delirium league had a portion of its patch notes from the Chinese Realm leaked a few hours before the official announcement. This put us in a very awkward position for the following reasons:

* It was one single leak, which put us in the aforementioned bind of a megathread being a 1-2 hour band-aid at best.
* It was being advertised as from an official source (specifically the post in question linked to the Chinese forums, we later found out the patch notes weren’t there but we had to treat it at face value at the time).
* It was a discussion heavy piece of content. In the past leaks were limited to a sentence or two in a press release or a simple screenshot. This leak had a lot of big number changes that naturally got people talking/discussing. This will only happen more in the future.

Combined with the sub’s explosive growth over the last few months, we’ve come to the realization that dancing between the lines of allowing all or no spoilers has become haphazard to enforce and (understandably) hard to interpret from the user end.

##What do you think?

It’s hard for a good faith user to know what’s being done about leaks if they’re all being removed and if we (the modteam) highlight leaks ourselves, we’re unintentionally supporting their distribution. So our best bet is to be proactive and iron out a clearly defined policy that the sub can *see* and more importantly can *expect* league after league.

To that end: what are your thoughts? 

* Should we remove all spoilers as they come, leave them for the votes to decide, or stay with our current stance?
* What do you think about leaks/spoilers in the post title?
* Does another subreddit have a leak policy you like?
* Additional suggestions are welcome, but bear in mind we can’t pin a third post!

We’d like to hear from as many people as possible so please feel free to discuss.

I have not in a season ever seen 'dozens' of exalts.  The furthest I have progressed was Metamorph (Sirius 8 defeated), where I decided early on to spend Regrets to transition my starter into my only character. 

Builds I have played: Necro(all kinds), Cyclone, Totem, Power Siphon wand, Righteous Fire, Blade Vortex, Glacial Spike, Windripper tornado shot, Tectonic Slam, Poet's Pen, Facebreaker, Essence Drain, Sunder

Most enjoyable builds: Poet's Pen, Necro, Righteous Fire, Totems

Notable Meta builds I have not tried: Mines/traps, lacerate, several bow builds

Typical # Exalts 3 weeks in: 3-5

Playstyle: My Diablo days were Hardcore only.  The one-shot mechanics of POE (death without info) is the only reason I stopped playing HC.  I don't trade much at-all (1-3x per day on weekend), and could easily slide into SSF if I had more playtime.  I am not the fastest player, with a juiced map taking about 5-6m.

fqqi0u,tempolamp9,Things in PoE that makes you want to stab yourself in the eye with a pencil,"We all (at least most of us) love PoE, thats why we are here!

That being said, there are a few (*serious understatement*) things in the game that sometimes are so annoying that you just want to headbutt yourself to death against your computer screen. I have myself just now encountered a few of those things and I feel that if I dont blow off some steam and write about it here, something terrible will happen. If anyone else feels the same way, feel free to chip in down below.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Using leapslam to travel fast in a map only to end up getting teleported back to the location you started at.

\-Being in a delirium trying to pick stuff up in a huge ocean of items but the game is so unresponsive that nothing happens when you press the item and you end up looting 2 blue mauls that fill up all your inventory space.

\-Having items drop behind portals or npcs that makes it impossible to pick them up in maps that only allows you to teleport out one time.

\-Slowly dying to tornadoes in Pillars of Arun because its impossible to dash/leap/etc to the next platform.

\-Purchasing a new computer to play poe on higher settings only to find that the game barely runs at all even at the lowest settings and trying to figure out why.

\-Having  60% of your screen covered by auras, debuffs, the hud, the minimap, quests (at least u can close the chat) making it close to impossible to see what you are doing.

\-Suddenly dying seemingly without any explanation as to what happened.

\-Whispering 100 people on poe trade trying to buy an item without anyone responding.

\-The fact that you cant right click items to equip them and that you cant move or equip items in your inventory while vending them

fqoqdc,Wowfanperson,If there is a huge balance change that involves trying to slow down the game. One thing that has to go is player immunity to ailments and effects.,"Basically stuns, Freeze, Shock, any none damaging ailment needs to not be complete immunity, things like poisons, ignite, can't be immune but can be responsively removed. This is a huge part to why monsters later on in the game lose more of their identity, when you become immune to everything, and very fast theres only so much diversity a fight can have.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, we should be able to build partial resistance to things. Like say a cap of ""75% effect of freeze"" so say freeze is a 100% action speed reduction, its now 25%, say chill would be 30% action speed reduction, 75% of that would instead be around 7.25% or something?

&amp;#x200B;

fqod8b,lachdanan66,RF in 3.10 is fine! (SSF Awakener 8 deathless),"I keep reading how RF is dead or countered by awakener and/or delirium and just wanted to showcase that isn't the case at all. The delirium debuffs are hardly noticable, especially if you keep moving and ""don't stand in the bad"". Sirus' degens are also pretty fair - with the exception of stupid maze/corridor TP's.

I league started in SSF as RF chieftain and have been going very well. I've had little to no issues with any content and have completed shaper/elder and their guardians, cortex, 20/20 simulacrum, all conquerors and of course, over a dozen awakeners (most @ AL8) The only reason I haven't killed Uber Elder yet is due to getting wrecked by the fragments from elder (5 of 1, 0 of the other).  
This is my most recent Awakener kill: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNP2e1a9x6U&amp;t=9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNP2e1a9x6U&amp;t=9s)  
I haven't focussed much on delving this league (\~190 depth) but RF is generally awesome for running in the darkness thanks to the regen).

While I agree that RF isn't nearly as powerful as a lot of the more meta skills, I disagree that it's ""dead"". It's certainly viable, and capable of handling all the end game content. 

I feel like loudest voices on here just regurgitate the same ""delirium counters RF entirely lul"" so I'd like to hear the perspectives of other RF enthusiasts, or other's that may have tried RF recently.

Tbh I only recently began playing poe again after a pause of like 3 leagues so the whole conqueror thing is very new to me, but still I would describe myself as an intermediate player.  
Now in the last week my map sustain was relatively good. I managed to get 16 watchstones in a span of  a week approximately and didnt need to buy any maps and I was happy.

 Now I tried breaking throuh that wall of sirus and getting to T15 T16 maps and getting the 17-20 watchstones, but all my t13 and t12 maps didnt drop any higher maps and i rarely sustained them. I thought that maybe I was just having bad luck (I quanted, alched, vaaled and master missioned them all). So I started running white t5 maps just to use up all my white master missions and confirm my theory that I was just having bad luck.  
But now after having run like 10 t5 maps I actually almost exclusively got t4 maps and lower, and didn't even sustain these low tier maps! And I am completely flabbergasted as to how this si possible! Just thought normal mapping I have 20 t5 maps left over, and now I can't sustain them?

fqkvnf,Warnora,Notable stacking is far from being broken and is what makes cluster jewels interesting,"I've seen posts about cluster jewels being broken, people complaining about an interaction they don't understand or care about, but since notable stacking seems like the big new op thing that this league has brought upon us, we see more people against it than people for it, as it is the essence of reddit.

Except notable stacking is not new, has been in the game since a long time, and requires a lot more thought than just getting good cluster jewels.

Yes, the interactions aren't clear but you need to invest passive points into them, potentially missing out on interesting normal jewel sockets which give you lots of benefits for only one or two points spent to get them. 
Normal jewels also don't force you to rethink your tree, it's extremely common to have 3-4 normal jewel sockets in your build by the time you're level 90 since you should have taken all important notables by then, and will need extra stats for a minimal point cost.

Cluster Jewels require you to invest a lot more points into a jewel to get benefits out of it, and even then, let's be honest, most of the notables by themselves are not worth the investment and you'd better stick to the ones on the original tree.

Notable stacking is great. Really. 
It brings what cluster jewels lack, it brings stats.
As I said before, normal jewels give you lots of stats for little investment, they're basically notables that you can craft, and they also stack. 
Yes, normal jewel stacking is equivalent to notable stacking, same jewels, same stats, multiple times, stacking.

It's inherently better than cluster jewel notable stacking because if you really want to use it, you have to plan your build around it, prepare several cluster jewels with the notables you want, get large jewels that will benefit your build, path towards the extremely spaced cluster jewel sockets, invest at least 3 points to get the socket, at least 3 other points (on a rare large cluster jewel that grants 8 passives and 2 jewel sockets) to get one of the sockets on the jewel, 2 points again to get to the second one and 3 points + 3 points at best to get all of the notables you want on a medium or small cluster jewel socketed in the aforementioned sockets. 
That brings us to a total of 14 passive points on minimum rolled ""adds # passives"" cluster jewels just to get 2 same notables stacked. 
Imagine doing this with not perfectly rolled jewels.

Rinse and repeat on at least another jewel socket, spend another 14 points, and there you go, 28 points for 4 same notables stacked. 

Yes, you also get the benefits of the small passives inbetween, and yes, you can stack 4 different notables with the same jewels if you use medium or small jewels with 2 notables, but for 28 points spent I really hope that you do get something out of it.
And that's without taking into account that you have to path from your starting point to the cluster jewel socket cluster (before spending 3 point to get the socket)

Notable stacking is costly, and going for 3 or more cluster jewel sockets to stack 6 or more notables is very risky, as pathing to get to the sockets and spending points into the jewels will inevitably sacrifice offence or defence that could have been provided by other notables on the original tree or normal jewel sockets for less point investment.

Theorycrafting has never been more fun, and I really mean it, removing notable stacking will remove what makes cluster jewels great, and we will all stick to the classic tree and normal jewels since it won't be worth the investment anymore.",6,1585404695,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqkvnf/notable_stacking_is_far_from_being_broken_and_is/,pathofexile,1
fqktgn,forsenK,'Trigger socketed spells when you focus' not working correctly?,"I just crafted the 'Trigger socketed spells when you focus' craft on my helmet and I'm a bit confused and disapointed as I thought, that this might be the first time I'll ever use the focus skill.  


It seems to be different than the usual trigger.  First of all it triggers all skills socketed, which is good, BUT the order seems off. Usually trigger trigger after each other, the focus skill seem to trigger things at the same time. ( [https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Trigger#Order](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Trigger#Order) )  
Here's an example: We got 1 green socket at the top left and 1blue socket at the top right sockets in our piece of gear. If I use the focus skill it should trigger the red gem and the blue gem a in that order, right?   
So the following thing should work: We put desecrate into the green socket and an offering into the second one, so there should be immediatly corpses which can be consumed by an offering as the trigger order should be green-&gt;blue. BUT when I try using it that way it spawns corpses and does not trigger the offering, so there is either an unusual triggerorder, the craft triggers all the skills at the same time or the trigger is too fast for the offering to recognize that there are corpses?

&amp;#x200B;

Is it intended to not work like that? I mean it could be a cool craft I would surely use more often and believe other people too as you can trigger 2 skills or more that interact with eachother at the same time. That would need less slots in the bar and also less pressing of keys.

If it is not clear what I mean please ask, I'll try to answer that",3,1585404481,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqktgn/trigger_socketed_spells_when_you_focus_not/,pathofexile,1

fqkg0l,samuraigregmeister,The solution to dead/alive gameplay that noone wants,"Reddit is mainly for people to complain about PoE. Everyone that is enjoying the gameplay is playing, so this is where all the frustrated players come, and its only the people that love the game that come here to complain. When people hate or dislike a game, they just go to another game. Its only when someone loves a game and thinks it can be better that they complain.

#In keeping with that spirit, lets talk about the dead/alive gameplay that PoE has evolved into. In other words, the one-shot mechanic.

As most anybody that plays this game for any period of time, for tuned, geared builds, pretty much every death is from a one-shot. 

Many people don't like this, especially in the face of the fact that most of these come from overtuned league mechanics and off screen/low visibility bullshit. That's besides the point though. Even if we discount ""unfair"" one-shots, they are still the primary method of death. (bearers, slams, etc.)

##Why do people only die to one-shots?

It is because one-shot mechanics are the only thing that can actually kill a player in many cases.

##Why are one-shots the only thing that can kill a player?

It is because characters are almost always at full life. When almost all damage is instantly recovered, no amount of successive hits can kill a player because the damage of each it recovered in the time between hits.

##What is the solution to this problem?

The nerf of recovery.

##Does anyone actually want recovery nerfed?

Hell no.

##Why?

Its gonna feel really bad.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The only way for players to die to non-one-shots is to spend a meaningful amount of time below full health.

The only implementable way to achieve this is to nerf recovery so that getting back to full health is a difficult/slow process.

Nerfing recovery always feel bad. It takes getting used to, and you're gonna die from things that you didn't die to previously. you can't play as haphazardly as you used to, and the gameplay slows down because more caution is required.

Slowing down gameplay has almost never been well received. Look at BF:V. People fucking raged about guns getting nerfed. Look at when the gold rubberband was introduced to dota and games started taking longer. Same thing. Communities generally don't like moving from fast gameplay to slower.

No need to look to other games really.

Does anyone remember what it was like when Vaal Pact got nerfed?

It fucking sucked and everyone hated it, even though it was necessary for game health. But people eventually got used to it.

Remember not that long ago when Immortal Call got nerfed? People bitched and moaned about that too. (It didn't really go away it just got replaced by Molten shell but the point stands)

What about when GGG gutted spell leech?

The fact of the matter is that power creep has hit the game in more than one way. Its not just damage that has increased, but survivability.

The game is not fun when there is no danger of death, do GGG had to keep killing players, and they did that by increasing monster damage. Which in my opinion was the incorrect decision that has lead us to the current gameplay of Schrodinger's Box: Video Game Edition.
------------------------------------------------

From now on, I am working off the assumption that monster damage is properly tuned and they do a moderate amount of damage, not enough to one shot, but not nothing either.

For players to die to non-one-shots, the health bar must decrease somewhat slowly (Ideally this is done in a manner where there is counter play) from safe region of high health to a danger region of low health.

There are several ways to do this.

1. Monster damage slowly ramps up on an individual scale. The longer it takes to kill a monster, the more damage they do. This is a horrible solution for several reasons. One, it ties survivability to damage, which kills build diversity. Two, power creep has made monsters trivial with players usually one-shotting white mobs, blues, or even rares. Players do too much damage for this solution right now. Three, if you forget about a monster or just don't see it for long enough, it will one-shot you.

2. Unpurgeable, stackable DoT effects. Think about what the game would be like if the entire game was like a milder form of the delve darkness. However, there are several problems with infinite scaling damage in game health, but I digress. (This solution is essentially the same as 4 but achieved in a radically different manner with severe side-effects)

3. Slowly ramp up the number of monsters. This idea works along the lines of the first solution in that it ramps up monster damage, but it does it in a way that can't result in one-shots. However, I think we can all see that increasing mob counts in a loot based game is unimplementable.

4. Nerf Recovery. If you want people to die at low health and only at low health, they got to spend time at low health.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Power creep has affected player health pools in some limited capacity, moving from 4k to 8k over the years, but in that same time frame, I would say that player damage has increased by factor 100, and recovery has increased by factor 10.

**The reason that only one-shots kill players is because players are always at full health and monsters have no way to ramp up damage**

-------------------------------------------------------------

How recovery has gotten out of hand
- life recovery more multipliers
- energy shield recharge rate multipliers
- wicked ward
- more sources of stackable recovery (ascendancies, items, skills)

How to nerf recovery
- removal of ""more"" multipliers of regen (belts, ES recharge rates)
- lower leech caps
- fewer sources of recovery (marble amulets are bullshit and recovery is built into too many skills, removing investment)
- Nerfing Ascendancies (This is the biggest one, almost every ascendancy gives provides some form of ""free"" recovery, trickster is super bullshit)
-wicked ward moved off main tree
-fewer sources of leech/harder to acquire leech

Combined effect of nerfing all forms of recovery

 I wanted to try a Champion Hollow Palm build back after my first char (Sabby - Trapper, because why not) hit maps. I got in before the hype train spiked the cost and it's been a quick and breezy ride... yet I'm confused by the other Hollow palm champs I see on POE.ninja at the high end of the leveling spectrum. 

 Am I missing something? They're all dual wielding wands or Thor-hamma's. Is it just POE.ninja looking for offhands, or is there some sort of benefit to wielding weapons with the beautiful Jewel of Unencumberdance. Trademark pending.

 Also, if anyone has suggestions to improvement I'd love to hear em. I've drained most of my cash making tweaks but it's been such an easy ride I don't think throwing more ex into this is without merit. Cyclopeon is an obvious, if I can juggle the resist drops on everything else. Removing the Praxis would be nice but I've gotta balance that mana drain.

fqhzsw,Koppernicus_,A sad realization about POE,"This is going to be somewhat long, but there is no way i can TL;DR this, POE players like the grind anyway...

# Issues

There are many issues with POE right now, and most players fall into a category of complaints. BS boss fight mechanics, the trading system, fps drop, power creep, splinters, visual clutter, basically invisible effects, take your pick.

What we all have in common, regardless of our pain, is that we feel ignored, nobody is listening, and i assume this is expected, it's very hard for anyone to gauge the collective feeling about something based on public message boards of any kind. This includes us, as a ""hater"" i don't know whether I'm being a loud obnoxious troll, hating on a great game, or signaling an issue with the game, but I chose to assume that the issues i see are real.

# The sad truth

What all of these issues mean, is that the people developing POE have stopped playing the game. I, as a casual player (casual in POE terms), can find the argument that i need to get good and stfu, but there are a couple of questions that need to be asked, is it only me who thinks these are issues?

1. When is the last time the game designers fought the awakener? Do you look forward to the fight? Do invulnerability phases where you dodge 2 screens wide storms mean ""good design"" for you?
2. Did you gear up a character? Try to buy some fusings to get a 6-link, how is the trading working for you? Try to start a new character 2+ weeks into a league, and use your first 2-3c or alch to buy some gear, see how that goes. I don't think anyone who actually uses the current trading system enjoys it.
3. Why do we have splinters in game? It's just lazy design, you might say that you want to smooth out the rewards, get an idea of your progress towards a goal, but the same people will tell you that sometimes it takes 40 fusings to 6-link, sometimes it takes 4000, RNG is part of the game. There is a certain joy you get when something good drops, an ex, a valuable unique, a Smoking Blunt Quiver, etc, picking up splinters trades this joy of finding something valuable for the frustration of picking up countless worthless fragments. Would someone who plays and enjoys the game say that more splinters are a good idea? Ever?
4. Play some delirium, it's a nice idea for a mechanic, it's what the game is about, slaying endless waves of mobs for rewards, why do we have to pick up splinters and have invisible BS kill us? POE players are generally pro challenge, pro difficulty, we like to see how far we can optimize our characters, how strong can we get, but the challenge created by dying to a group of exploding shit that just appeared under you while you were picking up a splinter is challenging you tolerance to frustration, as a player, rather than your in game character, this is not difficulty, it's again, lazy design. ""Let's just deal 20.000 damage to a player randomly and call it difficulty""
5. Trying to dodge all the BS detonate dead, on death stuff, projectiles etc, makes you feel like you are playing a ludicrous version of Chicken invaders

These are the first signs of devs losing touch with the community, this ends with a bunch of corporate career people looking at charts and statistics, deciding that having to use a ""toilet orb"" every day is a good way of keeping people playing the game.

Please GGG, actually play your game, and fix the things YOU will find frustrating.

# Ideas

I'm sure this machanics-horny community can come up with a bunch of ideas for balancing the game, but here are mine.

1. Make ""reflect"" an integral part of the game. Reflect could occur a lot more often, be unavoidable, and reflect a very small percentage of damage. If mobs reflect 0.5% of damage, there won't be a 100mil dps viable character, players will have to balance offense and defense, and maybe you won't have to balance the boss fights by adding invulnerability phases
2. A delirium type encounter could end by gathering the remaining mobs into a metamorph type fight. This means clear speed characters can take advantage of their good map coverage to make the end fight easier, while single target DPS is rewarded for being able to handle stronger boss fights, thus completing the same encounter with less clear speed. The end fight could also drop all the loot, which would make a lot of people happy.
3. Make trade requests appear without being in the same zone with another player, when trade is accepted stash opens on the right, instead of your inventory, trade window on the left. (maybe include a picture of the other player's character with every trade, so you can keep pushing microtransaction awareness and getting fat $ stacks)
4. Add more corpse destroying mechanics, so we can avoid offscreen detonate dead killing us randomly.
5. Add AOE attack resistance, so we can gear/skill towards avoiding death by invisible fog zombie appearing and detonating under us.
6. Generally, we want to be able to find solutions to problems when we die, my character dying should point to an issue it has, not point to a GGGGotcha mechanic under the pretense of ""difficulty""
7. The simulacrum boss should be a bong smoking Empyriangaming, spreading all that smoke and ""delirium"", how is this not obvious?

I lied in the beginning, this all sums up to ""GGG please play your own game more, and fix the shit parts"".

fqhusj,irecki88,A6 boss GPU usage,"Hey everyone

As most people here, I am also having issues with getting stable frame rates today. About 12 hours ago game was playable, then the patch came which caused my game to have massive lag spikes, following that hotfix arrived which didnt do anything for me.

I tried to tinker with graphic settings (you can see on the picture, everything set to low except resolution - native for the screen). I also reverted my graphic drivers (using DDU, Rx Vega 64)to ones from January - did not help / didnt make it worse. 

Stumbled upon this accidentally, all graphic settings set to low, no auras, no mtx, but standing next to a6 boss statue causes AMD overlay to show GPU usage at 100% and kicks gpu fans into higher gear... just for standing there with camera zoomed in - what gives?

I have now deleted content.ggpk file hoping that having fresh one (rather than having it updated)  will make any changes.

Here's a league mechanic where you will automatically lose if you stop for anything. One that does not function with all map layouts. One that premiates looking at nothing and running blind as fast as you can and faster - just a quicksilver flask is not enough.

I don't really mind too much. Just confusing.   
Metamorph premiated slowing down, Delirium will actively punish you for anything close to slow.

There is plenty of awesome lore scattered around the world in voice logs. Problem is that it's very inconvenient to consume them. Current system does a great disservice to the people who work with story. Want to know the motivations of Sirus? Listen to his journal when it appears after conquerors kills. But don't you dare moving, or you'll have to start over. What if you skipped first couple entries of the journal? Go find it on youtube I guess? Of course majority of people doesn't bother with that.

Persistent voice logs alone would fix a big part of the problem.

fqgzmn,Nekuromyr,"Splinter droprate is THE SAME. It wasnt nerfed, its just distributed more evenly now...","Ppl need to understand, that poe started to behave like any modern mmo when it comes to loot distribution.
It´s fixed and not a dice roll, set by higher-ups to ensure best longevity and maximize player retention! (Computers cant really dice-roll anyways...)

So about the splinter drop-rate here is what happened:
**Before vacuum:**
Many ppl tried to rush the mechanic to reach the end/boss.
If a splinter dropped too far behind them, they didnt pick it up. Going fast they didnt backtrack the whole map either. 
Since GGG set the limit of splinters per hour/day/week/minute to lets say 1000, that means rushers like me only looted for example only a total of 10 per hour, while others in juiced maps would loot the rest of them and gain 990 in total.

**After vaccum:**
Not a single splinter is ""lost"" by zoom zooming anymore meaning everyone now gets all splinters. So normal players suddenly take sth like 700 splinters, leaving only 300 for the highend.

Now heres the catch.
In BOTH scenarios, the droprate was 1000 splinters per XYZ minutes. 
**=&gt; The droprate hasnt changed!**

Its just distributed to many more ppl than before... And as a highend player, you will notice that immediately, cause you cannot get the ""lost"" splinters anylonger. They were now taken, by ppl like me that skipped them before the patch for like 70% of the time!",13,1585388312,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqgzmn/splinter_droprate_is_the_same_it_wasnt_nerfed_its/,pathofexile,1

fqfvco,OanSur,Question about CwC VD,"I always liked the idea of this skill combination, but the idea of utilizing cwdt and basically discarding all damage reduction was too much for me, and considering the difficulty spike of Delirium, playing as such glass cannon to me is not really fun.
  
That said, i was meddling in PoB checking the chieftain variant of the build and noticed that ""Arohongui, Moon's Presence"" was lighted up extremely in terms of Total damage increase. That gave me an idea, idea that probably someone already tried. 
  
For VD we would use standard linking: 
Cyclone-CwC-VD-Spell Cascade-Concentrated Effect-Elemental Focus/Combustion.  
  
As for corpse generation, well... 5linked:  
Spell Totem-Multiple Totems-Faster Casting-Desecrate-Spell Cascade-Desecrate. Throw in Flamedash for sixth socket.  
  
And 4 linked Spell Totem-Faster Casting-Unearth-GMP. 
  
That setup leaves us with two 4-links for auras and defensive cwdt. We can now use annointed charging offensive with Scold's Bridle to generate frenzy and endurance charges without losing cast speed due to damage reduction, and immortal call for the same reason. Not to mention we fix our problems with mana and life sustain.  
  
Desecrate corspe cap number is 10, so is with Unearth, only they count separatedly, so we can have 20 corpses at once.
  
I know it brings some issues, like having to stop spinning to plant totem, or probably not being able to precast crapload of orbs since if im not corrected i believe spell totems will only start casting when an enemy is around (which we can fix with Writhing Jar for example), but considering the benefits, this would make a nice leveling option, especially for chieftain.  
  
But maybe i'm wrong. Maybe there is something i dont see and this wouldnt work. If so, enlighten me before i waste currency to try this out.",1,1585382107,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqfvco/question_about_cwc_vd/,pathofexile,1

I didn't bother pulling up the fps menu since I knew it was going to be crap.  Dynamic res did it's job and the game ran pretty smooth, even in delirium, albeit with very bad pixelation.

I recently swapped to a 2080s and 27in 1440/144.  FPS is spiking up and down nonstop.  This is also on lowest settings.  In hideout with no movement it jumps from 80-150 constantly, while moving the low can drop as far as 50.  What's confusing me is even with dynamic res set to 60, I'm stuttering like crazy in delirium while fps drops to 20's.  Outside of delirium I drop as low as 40's with less stuttering but it's still present.  Doesn't appear to be dropping my res to compensate.

Some other points:

\-Vsync, foreground disabled.

\-Multithread enabled.

\-Running monitor off gpu.

\-Also using a 1080/60 as second monitor, disabling had no noticeable difference.

\-Predicitive mode.

\-GPU drivers updated.

\-Screen set to 144hz.

\-Gsync enabled.

\-DP cable.

&amp;#x200B;

Potential issues?

\-I see that the ACER kg271 is on the nvidia freesync list.  I have the kg271u.  Would that be causing such a drastic change?  

\-Am I suppose to turn on freesync from somewhere or is it on out of the box?

\-I know the r5 1600x bottlenecks the 2080s.  Could this cause this much erratic fps spikes?

fqethk,greendragon2194,Keep Cluster Jewel as a CORE GAME MACHANIC NOT LEAGUE MECHANIC,"Cluster Jewel is one of the most creative and build enabling item in the game since the introduction of influenced items. It creates so much more build diversity and I really enjoyed it. The mechanic fit in perfectly to GGG game design which is diversification but also the jewels itself balance out by making you spending passive points (which is a significant opportunity cost as well). The more you use cluster jewels, the more you potentially lose out on passive tree nodes and not to mention the pathing points towards outer jewel sockets. Whoever designed this really deserved a pay rise to my opinion.

Please GGG do not make these jewel be a league mechanic. I have been enjoying my build enabled by cluster jewel and I DO NOT WANT MY BUILD ENABLER to be gated by being ""League-exclusive"" or the stupid 10% league mechanic occurance (if Delirium make into core game).

fqe4ii,Okodokodoko,This league has finally broken me. Don't ever try to make unleash work.,"I thought I could try starting this league checking out what animate weapon was all about with the new changes. Started off okay, but the clunkiness of only summoning one weapon at a time + having to do the motion in 2 separate parts meant standing still. So when pushing deep into delirium random mobs killed my blades or they exploded due to random events, I'd stand still, then die myself; Caught in the paradox of not having knives out meant they'd eventually kill me anyway, but stopping to summon knives got me killed...

So I swapped to a miner. I got a 6L tremor rod and a kaom's, trying to push into high level things and ball lightning seemed to some what do the trick? But once again, I found myself going deep into delirium, the mines not killing the mobs and myself having to stand still to place my mines; A familiar paradox where if I don't gt them down, the mobs will kill me all the same, but the act of standing still to get them down kills me.

So I reroll again: I try something novel. I go Trickster Unleash Archmage Arc. I've never done unleash before, and I like Trickster. 6L Cloak of Defiance, the whole shebang. I decided to go Elemental Overload because getting moderate defensives and going crit was basically an impossibility... Tooltip DPS looking good! And t10-11 maps seem to go really well! Right up until I start pushing delerium... 3 seals worth of arcs would wipe perhaps the white mobs, but a single rare, using arcane cloak and fully charged seals would lose 10-15% of its hp unless it was literally right beside the mirror.

So I got my +1 seal annointment for an additional cast. I bought a helmet with +1 seal. I now have 5 seals. I adjusted some of my jewels, they're more efficient. Fevered Mind, replacing one apep with better wands...And yet: 

I cannot scratch Kosis. I cannot even make his ES tick down on a 2 person delerium. I had decent defensives, but at pouring EVERYTHING I could into making a non-crit unleash build, it didn't even scratch the surface of the ""content"". 

Greatest part, when they don't die in the unleash and you have to spam it? Aside from having your mana blown out, you also don't EVER get to see the benefit of the seals that were painstakingly acquired because it NEVER STACKS UP THAT FAR AGAIN. I only realized that too late. A 50% more hp (no other defensive mods) Dunes boss took me over a minute of watching my arc seals charge up to do 5% of his life.

I respecced from Trickster to Assassin. I finally feel like I have some damage, but I watched a blue mob walk up to me an punch me twice to kill me from full after I got stuck in a hidden slow aura pool.

I will not be rerolling a 4th time. I invested so much time and money into an unleash character in an attempt to match the desperate pace this league asks, and I feel there is no happy balance between damage and survivability. ESPECIALLY when party playing. 

Conclusion: Unleash is an untenable mess that doesn't, on its own, provide even CLOSE. An IOTA.. enough benefit to use it over things like spell echo, or just having other things cast your spells for you. You have to throw so much money into it that at that point you could just use virtually any other build to greater effect.

TL;DR I'm ranting because I'm sick of trying to make novel things work and watching my effort produce no results. Unleash is horrible. Even with +2 seals.

1) Tankier than every other tank build

2) More damage than 99% other builds (with gg gear you can push damage into tens of millions dps)

3) More movement speed than 99% other builds (seriously stacking movement speed + tailwinds makes for consistent 300-400% increased ms)

4) With some gear swapping you have explosions as well while mapping so same clear as top tier speed clear builds

I never got problem with high end builds that defined the meta (legion cyclone afk, blight summoner afk) but this shit is just too much. It does everything in the game better than every other builds, theres no area where it doesnt excel (except maybe running some map mods). There were always trade offs, even for juiced HH builds, untill you stacked auras you were vulnerable to some things. This new guardian is a zoom zoom, insane single target, bring your own support do everything build. Its just stupid, theres no trade off.

[The story of the little Dutch boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates)

When I ticketed and explained that all they had to do was read the context of the conversation to see what it was about and what it meant, they literally argued with me that a particular word that has been used as the name for Holland's sea walls for more than 500 years was now hate speech in *any context*. Of course, they didn't know the word was a real word and had a real world history. The conversation with the manager (whom I escalated the ticket to) was utterly surreal.

Possible fix is allow pets to pick up select currency. Since you can have 2  you could have 1 set to picking up Orbs and have another set to picking up maps or 1 set to scrolls and one set to maps. Armor and Weapons can stay on the floor so people can sort through the good stuff.

fqbjqd,Nidion001,Trading Improvements/Idea,"I know the idea of an in-game auction house is a touchy subject, but I just thought of a decent solution to the current (and on-going for years now) trading problem. I don't know anyone that actually likes using the main website/3rd party websites to do all their trading. It's slow, you have to deal with price fixers and bots, and you have to whisper 20 people before you get one invite sometimes.

Here's an easy solution. A trade NPC/Master in your hideout. He acts as a shop, that connects directly to the main trade website. And functions similar to premium stash tabs. We could even have a very limited inventory for him too, if people think it's TOO easy to sell things with him. But he would function completely offline, people would see your listing on the poe trading website, and be able to teleport to your hideout, interact with your trading Master and he'd see every item you listed in their, with their exact prices. They could even leave messages, like offers or something, or they could just buy the item directly from him. Then when you log in the next day, your currencies sitting there waiting for you.

There's probably some holes in this, idk. Something I jsut thought of. I've never been in favor of a straight up Auction House in PoE. MAYBE one only for currency/maps/etc, but even that leaves room open for terrible market manipulation etc. This seems like a really cool way to implement better in-game trading, and add a bit of QoL having it function offline as well.",7,1585362558,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fqbjqd/trading_improvementsidea/,pathofexile,1

fqaxb0,f24np,Help with progressing farther past red maps? Caustic Arrow Trickster,"Hi all,  


Delirium is the league where I've gotten the farthest in my PoE history. This was the first league I've made it to 90 and to red maps (and getting to 90 in under 60 deaths was good for me). Last league I played was legion to level 87. 

I'm currently level 91 in red maps, but my progression has halted. I'm following Brittleknee's Caustic Arrow guide and I loved the build up until this point. Single target DPS was a little lackluster, but the clear was nice. I died a bunch this morning and decided I was gonna swap to her CI tree and invested in some CI gear. I'm still wearing Cloak of Defiance because I'm poor and don't have anything with better ES ratings with the right sockets/colors (and I'm out of chromes). My DPS went down a little bit because of having to spec out of my cluster jewels for more ES nodes. PoB has got me at about 460k Dot DPS and I have 5.7k ES. I still feel very squishy - everything is fine until I'm one shot. I have a +3 bow with a 6 link and 20 qual gems. I'm not sure what the next step in my progression is.   


Can anyone take a look at my path of building and also tell me how I should be progressing to get that DPS number up so I can handle red maps? I'm not sure if I should retire this character or not. It's been my only character this league so far. I only have 60 chaos to work with.

Personally I feel like the next league should be dropped to focus purely on optimising the game. Every league it gets worse, and every league there are numerous performance issues.

I'm playing champion cyclone with this new body armour 'Perfidy' 

There are a lot of them at the market and drop rate seems quite high in this league's content. 

I decided not to use fancy astral plate with -15 mana cost and explody stuff  after using this armour(did -3 craft to all my accessory). 

Its really satisfying, would like to share some info.

\-looks cool. You would not think any other mtx, even wings. You are carrying two banner at once and its cool. 

\-Duration of buff: war banner grants u 'Adrenaline', dread banner grants u 'Fortify'. First time, I link them with 20/20 duration gem and it lasted about 9 seconds. Now, I'm not using increased duration and it lasts about 7 seconds. 

\-Im lazy to do math, but fortify and adrenaline themselves are ""buff"" not ""aura"". war banner gonna grant u 20% + increased physical damage taken. 

\-Stage qol: in map it goes to 50 in 2-3 seconds. In boss fight, it is slower but still reliable. 

\-Buff exists only in placed banner area. You can think its range as bottled faith consecrated area. 

\-Press more button: u should use two skill key slot for banners. I use q and w slot. placing it is instant and it does not really bothering as blood magic suicidal champion stuff. 

\-My current link for banners: Enhance(4) + Dread banner + War banner + Blood rage(juicy attack speed). 

\-linked two banners with enhance support. Read them if interested but not enough to find wiki.

fq9nv0,BenjaCarmona,"When there is clarity, even death can be satisfying.","Just wanted to say that most of the new changes to clarity on delirium mods skills are amazing. I have been doing some delirium maps (just 20% t16 for now, with beyond, sextants, Alva, scarabs, the usual juice) and, even though they are deadly, the new effects are super clear. Specifically the lightning ones (the deadly X and that singularity explotion thingy) are really clear and look like something that will one shot you. I died once to a singularity and I knew I was the one who fucked up... I didnt get mad at all and even laughed at the fact that I got killed.

The amount of attention and engagement that these maps require is an amazing experience IMO, past leagues, even though I died a lot, since those deaths were practically random or because I didnt have defence for something that I couldnt manuver around, playing juiced maps was as mindless as running t1 white maps, just because there was no point on engaging with the live gameplay mechanics (still was the design of your character to survive some stuff, and building it, but the gameplay itself tends to be more mindless). Now I feel like my ACTIONS, not just design decisions for my build, matter, and that is amazing gameplay.

Please please please, we need more clarity in the game, that way we can actually get challenges that are deadly, but at the same time that feel fair.

tl;dr: More Shaper slams and delirium (updated) lightning Xs, less Sirus projection meteors (or anything that involves the current Sirus fight) please.",10,1585355654,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq9nv0/when_there_is_clarity_even_death_can_be_satisfying/,pathofexile,1

I play efficiently, and the issue is not to fund my gear this i learned ways to do (bossings, selling maps, jewellers) but it's about the ""big"" drops. Exalts in particular. I play the exact same way, or more efficiently, as a few friends of mine. Multiple 99, one 100 (no breachstone cheating), juicy maps, scarabs, fragments, master missions. I clear league content too. And every league (literally EVERY league) i see my friends doing the same thing just playing less time droping ex, after ex, after ex. A bad day for hem is one ex or two. A regular day is a 3 and good days are 4 or 5. 

I for myself sit on a 98 char now (and muuuuuuucccchhhh ore exp than this considering all the deaths, 9 days /played with few downtime), 32 challenges self farmed (about 3500 maps, 500 map bosses in ist completed long ago), with 2 ex droped. Last league I droped 1, 18 days /played. In Blight (got one lvl 100 one 99) literally 0 ex drop. And this goes on, and on and on since closed beta.

Big ticket items too. 90 sirius last league : 0 gloves 0 sword 0 gem. Siting at 16 w8 sirius this league : 15 helms 1 large jewel. In blight : 40 uber elders : 0 jewel, only worthless items. Same friends: 10ex gems, 100ex jewel, a mirror on two consecutive leagues, fated connection every single league for 3 years, etc.

I seriously wonder, even though i can't really believe it: is it possible that there are issues with the RNG seeds, as there was in i can't remember which league with a specific ite that could simply not drop on some accounts due to a messed up seed ?

I mean... Sample is starrting to be big enough. And even ""casual"" players drop an ex every 20ish hours of play from what i see in my guild. So why don't I ? And I am not the only one, sometimes i encounter someone telling me the exact same story : old player from closed beta, with a crazy streak of bad luck to the point it's not anymore a streak but something you learn to live with/play with.

[https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Triqah](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Triqah) 

I've followed Esoro's Lacerate Gladiator league starter build, and i'm currently stuck.   
I tried using impale, but it just felt underwhelming.. this could very well be due to a few mistakes i made with itemisation, gem links, jewels and so forth... 

I have read a few few guides where they generally recommend two well crafted siege axes with elder influence, however i have been running into mana problems without the 'Soul Taker, Siege Axe'. 

I want to transition to a bleed stack build, and would appreciate any advice as quite frankly i have no clue what i'm doing. Any up to date link with relatively decent dps and consistency would be appreciated!

And that there are Players out there who study the market on poe ninja and find market mistakes and holes and all that. And I stumbeled upon one.

It all began as I watched this Essence drain Streamer arphain (or sth Like that) making t17 100% Delirium double Beyonded map and looked it up because I wanted to the same build. I saw that He had a shield with 5% Es recovery when you Block. So I checked on poedb where it can roll. Okay. Ilvl 86 shaper base. Checked the base, 9 exalted. Nope to expensive because I only had Like 3 exalted. I then realized it rolls on a ilvl 86 crusader base as well. Checked the base. 5 to 6 exalted, too expensive as well.
then WAIT A MINUTE, lets Check crusaders exalted orb. 3 exalted. -&gt; MHHHH I gave it a go. Bought a ilvl 86 titanium spirit shield and a crusaders exalted orb. Combined it and priced it for 5 exalted. Insta bought because it Was below average price of 6 exalted.
Then the proudness of my accidental income began. Rince and repeated it with 2 exalted Profit every time.
And thats how I got 40 exalted in one day.

I hope you enjoyed my little tale and I hope I didnt destroy someone elses strategy. But sharing is caring right?

fq6y6r,M_sanity,@GGG PoE Game Files Keep Corrupting,"Steam version.

Nothing wrong with my SSD.  I have about 12 other games on it that have zero issues.  I also checked the drive multiple times for errors - none.

This has happened 7 times this league - and only this league.  I'll be doing my thing like normal then the game will close itself moving to a new instance.  If I try to log back in, the game keeps locking up and half loading textures.  if I somehow make it in the game, half the game is missing visually.

I verify the integrity of the files on Steam - it want's to redownload all 25Gb every-f'ing-time.  That means that the gpk is getting corrupted.

Why?  It's only been this league.  Been using the same drive for under a year.  No other game has this problem.  My Unity and Visual projects are perfectly fine.  My Recordings are perfectly fine.  The drive scans as error free.

fq6rsh,NeverSinkDev,[LOOTFILTER] NeverSink's itemfilter - version 7.8.2 - Major improvement to higher strictnesses and Economy Update #2,"----------------------------------
[LOOTFILTER] NeverSink's itemfilter 7.8.1
----------------------------------

This version contains a huge number of improvements. Most of these are focused around balancing out higher strictnesses (very strict and up). They've become more strict in general, better in identifying valuable items and should feel right at home for the high-loot-delirium-gameplay.

I **highly** recommend you to take the time to read the changelogs.

On top of that we've also adjusted and updated https://filterblade.xyz as well!

Changelog
----------------------------------

- [TIERING] Most tierlists have been adjusted to better match the current state of the game. Affected tierlists are: uniques, divination cards, unique maps, fossils, incubators, prophecies, scarabs, high level crafting bases, oils, fragments, shaper, elder, crusader, hunter, redeemer, warlord, vials, currencies, deliriumorbs

- Simulacrum splinters now come with a tierlist. Stacks of 3+, 12+, 30+ and 100+ (if you can reach it) have different appearances and sounds!

- the rare belt, ring and amulet section has been reworked. It's now split into rings+amulets and belts. The 65/75 level split has been removed, all items are now explicitely listed. ""Bad"" belts are now hidden on strict. ""Good"" belts are now hidden on very strict (because stygian is the one true good belt).

- Added basic tiering for delirium orbs

- Atziri sacrifice fragments (non-midnight) are now hidden on uber+ strict!

- T4 uniques are now hidden on uber strict instead of uber+ strict

- T3 uniques are now also hidden on uber+ strict

- Low Quality gems are now hidden on very strict, instead of uber-strict.

- T3 uniques no longer contain uniques that are boss-exclusive drops (these have all been moved to T3boss)

- The ""large perandus coin stack"" threshhold has been increased to 20. Uber+ strict hides anything below.

- Essence filtering has become stricter in the endgame. Uber+ strict now also hides screaming essences

- Economy-updated versions now retier all catalysts and more general currency

- Improved the tiering strategy for Kaom's Heart and a few other items with a similar conundrum.

- Low tier oils are now hidden on uber strict (instead of uber+). They no longer produce map icons on Very Strict

- Adjusted endgame flask highlight. Random non-quality Utility and top tier Life/Mana flasks are now only highlighted until T2 maps (instead of T4). Their strictness also went up.

- Generic Talismans are now hidden on very strict (keeping them visible, because you can easily sell them for mass alterations and those are going up in price like crazy). Their fontsize has been reduced.

- Strictened up highlight for mod-detected talismans

- Ilvl82+ magic abyss jewels are now hidden on uber strict

- Ilvl82+ rare abyss jewels are now hidden on uber+ strict

- rare random abyss jewels are now hidden on uber strict

- magic generic jewels are now hidden on very strict instead of strict.

- split small/large armours in the T1 rares. This split is purely functional and is only relevant for filter generation and filterblade.

- random normal/magic ilvl84-85 item bases are no longer highlighted on uber strict

- Breach rings are now hidden on strict.

- Slightly reduced the highlight level of the sound and map icon for T1 gems below level 4.

- Introduced a new section for enlighten/empower/enhance level 4

- Slightly reduced the highlight of T15+ blighted maps

- All Outlevled maps are now hidden on very strict

- Removed section for eyes and livers.

- 2Abyss Socket uniques are now correctly highlighted (and no longer picks up 1 abyss socket uniques)

- Non-84+ normal/magic atlas bases are now hidden on very strict.

Filter and Styleversions
----------------------------------

*Strictness-es are filter configurations the affect how much/little a filter shows. The general rule is that: as you clear faster, you want to pick up less, because in the time you'd take care of a higher quantity of items, you can kill more monsters and get a higher chance at rare loot. You can start with Regular/Semi-Strict first (great for new players and leagues) and simply up the strictness from the option menu, once you feel like you want to see less.*

Nr | Name | Short Description
---|---|----
0| Soft | Shows too much. Includes low crafting bases, magic jewellery in the endgame. Not recommended for regular gameplay.
1 | Regular | Shows a lot. Recommended for beginners, new leagues and slow-clearing gameplay. Shows all rares. Good for chaos recipes.
2 | Semi-Strict | Healthy balance. Great for new leagues and beginners and medium-speed endgame gameplay. Hides the worst rares. Good for chaos recipes.
3 | Strict | Hides bad-base rares and scrolls. Universal and recommended endgame strictness. Hides random gems (hold alt in the first zone if you level with it). Bad for chaos recipes.
4 | Very Strict | Hides most rares, scrolls, augments, armourers. Good for the endgame and for speed-farming.
5 | Uber Strict | Hides all low currencies and rares. Great for quantity-farmers.
6 | Uber**+** Strict | Shows too little. Sterile screen. Hides all kind of stuff, including mediocre divination cards, all kind of crafting material etc. Recommended for speed-clearing quantity-parties or as a base for further editing. Not recommended for regular gameplay.

*Styles have no effect on how strict the filter is, but change the visual and audio configuration. Find one that pleases your eye most or make your own on https://www.filterblade.xyz . FilterBlade also comes with a preview comparison/feature for styles and strictnesses*.

fq6mc6,Urazhill,[Suggestion] Performance Issues,"Hello Exiles!

Firstly I know very little about programming and debugging, however, I figured I'd offer a suggestion to players who are having performance problems, and since these are desperate times, any suggestion may be considered.


Personally, I have not taken any advice from anyone about changing coding, launch settings, or clearing caches. All I know is that prior to the most recent patch, I was having insane ping spikes and frame drops to zero. After this recent patch my game runs more or less as intended. 


For reference, I am running the game on Windows 10 with 16bg RAM, 8GB 1070, an i7 7700 @ 4ghz, on a basic SSD, with graphics settings turned down all the way except for textures, post processing, and texture filtering. I have my FPS set to a cap of 119 even though my refresh rate is 144 because it seems to keep frame time steadier. Windowed full-screen, 1080p, no sync. Now on to my suggestion.


Presumably GGG is patching the game based on its DEFAULT state. When people run into performance problems they will haphazardly make changes to many areas of the games file system, configuration settings, and other setting in order to fix the problem. Now here is where my potential ignorance comes in - I don't know if patches revert these changes automatically and I don't know what YOU individually made changes to before or after these patches. All I know is that something GGG may have adjusted or implemented might not be working well WITH those changes and it COULD be why you are now having bigger issues than before. My guess is that since they are trying to fix everyone's default game state, it may be possible that your game is reacting differently than when they test these patches in the office. 


If I were you, I would try to reinstall and make sure any changed files are reverted to their default state and see if it helps at all. I just want you all playing, having fun, and picking up mirrors. 


Thanks for listening. If my advice is rendered invalid because I'm flat out wrong about how these things work, I'm happy to hear it!


Tl;Dr - Patches may have effected your game negatively because of all the weird adjustments you may have made to fix performance issues on your own prior to patch. Why not try reverting all of these adjustments and do a CLEAN reinstall of all related files.",4,1585345706,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq6mc6/suggestion_performance_issues/,pathofexile,1

fq6b0y,Melotronical,Angry reddit thread about angry reddit threads.,"First of all i think GGG made dellirium one of the best and most enjoyable leagues yet. Maybe not for HC but well its hardcore your problem if you play it. 

I think its disgusting how the ""angry redditors"" are circlejerking about how bad this and that is and how its unplayable and they die all the time and its not rewarding enough...

Maybe you have to play another build this league or adapt to it and not just metacucking the same build every league.

I enjoy poe for not beeing an easy game and to actually think about how to adapt to the new league mechanic. And for that i manage to solo 100% dellirium t16 full juiced maps with a total offmeta build. And please dont cry about not clearing endgame on a 5c budget.
Or ""its too hard so noone wants to join in and sooo many people are at home right now but dont play poe because the season sucks."" 
Poe isnt made for the casual gamer or a broad mass its a high performance arpg with very complex mechanics. People who enjoy this are playing it already and the others probably not... who cares?

fq64yw,Flextapedmysphincter,PoE 2 Fog appreciation thread.,"The fog tech they are using from PoE2 is very nice. It has almost 0 performance hit(atleast for me), it reacts to the environment, dissipating when there are ground effects or blight lanes or delirium boss spawns.  In some rare instances I also get much stable 60 fps while doing things in the fog which would've caused drops on normal circumstances.  

Most of the positive from this got offset from their decision to use gray for everything delirium related.

People have been making a lot of angry threads about game needing performance improvements, but I think if this fog is just a small slice of the improvements in PoE2, then GGG already is working on it.  I hope they keep adding in more of the new tech in poe and also work on optimizing or reworking the old stuff.",0,1585344278,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq64yw/poe_2_fog_appreciation_thread/,pathofexile,1

fq62vz,wetfangs,Question about going claw with bloodseeker instead of foil on my reave/bf champion.,"Should i go claw with bloodseeker and a 400 pdps off hand claw. i know bloodseeker is lower like 250 pdps so instead of the ingame pob thats 12m pdps if i would dual wield x2 400 pdps foil, i would get 5-7m dps thats still big enough right? the general idea is that bloodseeker instant leech paired with offering of the serpant overleech gloves could make me facetank or really tanky. Im just unsure on how well it would goes in high level contents considering i could get much more dps going foils and still have leech just not instant with the gloves being still on so overleech.

since my english is not the best im making tldr :

bloodseeker + 400 pdps claw + offering of the serpant = less dps but instant leech + overleech OR

dual 400 pdps foil + offering of the serpant = higher dps no instant leech but still overleech.

There is no get away and it behaves buggy in many scenarios,"Its so frustrating lol. I tried to jump inside the impact. I tried to dodge the impact waves. I try to run away to the other side of the arena. I try to hide behind walls or other cover. It gets me everytime, merciless one shot.

Some other random strange scenarios:


- Sometimes when I see the jump coming I can make it to the other side of the arena in time. He lands but the shock wave doesnt trigger!! When i get close to him again the wave is coming from no where suddenly even if its 10 seconds after he landed. One shot

- When the shock wave kills me, I had a scenario where i entered the arena through the portal again and INSTANTLY get killed from the shock wave again. But its not a new attack he is not jumping. Its weird, as if the shock wave that killed me didnt finish its animation and killed me again when i reentered

- that wave has a ridiculous aoe. Sometimes it gets me when im like a mile away. Its funny as in other cases the attacks aoe is way smaller, i dont understand it.

- it totally ignores any walls or any sort of cover. There is no escape lol it covers the entire arena. Boom one shot

Also you have like no time to prepare. Its so sudden . sometimes he spams it twice in a row . usually he waits for like 10 seconds.  Don't get the cooldown of it. Sometimes he jumps at you from off screen,no chance at all.

When do those messages pop up? Every hour, on the hour.   

Today while working, I noticed that my remote X session hiccuped like I noticed in the game on an hour boundary, and I just realized that I have my background images set to change every hour.

Related? Yes. You can test this easily by changing the frequency to 1 minute and notice the frame dip when you're not doing anything.

**TL;DR: If you don't want to bother at all testing, but want to save performance in game, disable the desktop image shuffle.**

To test quicker, see below; technical details follow:

----

Open up `regedit`, and navigate to:  

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Personalization\Desktop Slideshow  

Double-click the 'Shuffle' key and change the value to `1`  
Double-click the 'Interval' value and change the value to `10000` (value is in ms)  

Now, you'll need to restart Explorer to test this:  

1) Open task manager (ctrl+shift+escape)  
2) Find `Windows Explorer`  
3) Right-click it and go to `Restart`  
4) Open PoE and you might observe frame dips every 10 seconds now  
5) To undo the changes, just open the `Personalization` app in the Desktop right-click menu and change it back (preferably higher)  
6) Go back to PoE and notice there are no more dips every 10 seconds",4,1585340680,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq4wx7/if_you_rotate_your_desktop_background_on_win10_on/,pathofexile,1

fq2wcq,Musestricken,Unpopular opinion: I actually like the delerium league.,"I've seen a lot of grief for GGG about this league, and I understand that on PC the game usually runs smoother than it is currently, but holy smokes give the team a break. They have given us a ton of QoL improvements we've been asking for, they've reworked the league significantly since launch, and are working from home due to getting quarantined for corona. 

I actually don't mind the timed delerium encounters since it adds a sense of urgency. If I lose out on something I wasn't pushing hard enough. I also don't mind backtracking since I just play to relax anyway. Another couple of minutes to pick up stuff isn't that big a deal. And this league is running smoother on PS4 than metamorph ever did, which I was worried about when I saw the fog in the league teasers before launch. Sure there's room for improvement, but holy crap stop whining please. Just makes the fanbase look like a bunch of spoiled brats.

It is possible to feed Your animated guardian a Fishing rod. With the Chains Of Command chest it is also possible to spawn alot more fishing rods. It usually takes me about 6-8h before my first fish. Using this tactic i get about 1-2 fishes/hour.    
I also suggest you get  ""Spirit Guards Viridian Jewel"" It lets 8 of fishing buddies go ranged mode, wich will result in larger fishes. The further out to the sea you go = more Valueable catches.

I've been trying to make a glacial hammer berserker for the past few days. So far it's going pretty good, got my pandemonious today and even dropped an inspired learning gem. I can steam through t15 and t16 quite well, except for Bosses. The Map Bosses themselfs don't really pose a threat, they just take incredibly long. Conquerers after level 78 take even longer, especially Baran take forever and manages to kill me here an there.

My question now is if anyone has a idea how to scale single target damage on glacial hammer. I'm using Ancestral Warchief, Frostbomb and some Cold Pen, but that still seems not nearly enough.

fq1m6z,Snow_Regalia,"GGG, while Simulacrum as a whole is awesome, the actual fighting in the arenas sucks","For anyone who has attempted the Simulacrum, you'll probably have noticed two things: first, it's a cool design with the waves and the way the encounter functions, second, that the arenas themselves suck.  

I get that the idea of fighting in the city areas is appealing, but these arenas were not designed with fighting in mind, and it shows. Hysteriagate specifically is just absolutely abysmal. Keep in mind that Delirium has the following super common mechanics:  

 - Giant line attacks of frost/chaos damage with a medium width 
 - Delayed aoe blasts on mob death  
 - Delayed aoe blasts from mobs periodically  
 - Bosses with absolutely massive aoe attacks 
 - Kosis dropping black holes similarly to Sirus that take 2-3 minutes to despawn.  

A big part of the fun/frustration with Delirium in regular maps is that the more open maps feel better, because you can see the abilities and also have enough room to dodge them. The closed maps are a death chamber unless you're a tank, and are spent more trying to outrun the aoe than dodge it. The problem with Hysteriagate and the Simulacrum arenas in general is that there's a huge lack of space. Hysteriagate is entirely narrow corridors, spaces that give no room to dodge and are constantly spawning additional monsters and effects. At least in the Bridge Encampment arena you have a large space to dodge around in with a long lead in from the portal. 

Speaking of the portal, it is ridiculous that there is no safety spawn area for Simulacrum encounters. My main build this league is a Storm Brand Assassin. It's great at dodging around and killing things, but like many builds, it takes a couple seconds to get going when entering a map, because I can't cast Brand in my hideout and have them come into the arena. At later waves with high delirium, it's basically game over if I die, because the mobs instantly kill me when I enter the arena before I can place Storm Brands. Every other end game boss fight in the game gives you a staging area, whether it's walking in from a map like Uber Atziri or giving a small room before the main arena, like Elder, Shaper, and Sirus. 

I love Delirium and Simulacrum overall, but there's a few design decisions that really make me feel like it's not about how well I play, but whether or not I get lucky and get given a specific map.",3,1585331073,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq1m6z/ggg_while_simulacrum_as_a_whole_is_awesome_the/,pathofexile,1

fq0abk,Pulco6tron,Huge performance issues.,"Hi here

I wonder if i'm the only one to have tremandous performance isssues during betrayal and Legion encounters.

Normally my  game runs at 120 fps easily sometimes it's spiky but i guess it's inevitable when, you have like 1000 mobs on screen in juiced maps even more with delirium activated.But i can definitevely say when i'll have a Betrayal encounter or a Legion encounter when i enter in my map because, then my fps are this low, that it fell like playing to a novel game or a slideshow. Furthermore, most mob's texture aren't loaded making mobs either black silhouette or litterally invisible. Have you ever fight an intervention while Cameria Jorgin and Vagan are both invisible and the game running at 12 fps average ?Some elitist chad would say that this is the true ultimate hardcore gaming experience. When i succeed i effectively fell an accomplishment i actually beat the game, even if it used irregular/treacherous way to try to make me dead, after all. But most of the time, when i die, i just fell disgusted, it's frustrating to be one shotted by something you can't even see and/or react properly on specific conditions even more when the rest of the time the game is fluid.Those issues are particularly noticeable for intervention encounter (yes the most profitable one, the one when you die it's wasted ... so fun), Fortress betrayal encounter and Legion encounter (it's even worse if there is a Legion boss).  Once those are defeated the game turn back to normal. Even during bargaining with syndicate members still kneeling on the screen , the game is already back to normal and their texture finally appear. The issues are here since like 2 league or so but is really disabling and systematic since this league.

That's pretty sad since i wanted to invest time in this content for so long. I am actually barely able to clear this content properly and safely because of this. Most of my death are from this issue i hope it will be fixxed once or twice, the sooner the better.

I assume that i'm not the only one to have issues like this. it would be nice if GGG could noticed us if this is a known issue and if they are working on it .",7,1585327215,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fq0abk/huge_performance_issues/,pathofexile,2

Currently playing around with a Ice Crash build with Hallow Palm Technique and I was noticing that the ice crash was not shattering anything so Herald of Ice was essentially being useless.

Was just curious to why that may be, is there something I'm missing?  I currently have it converted to 90% cold so I'm doing mostly cold damage and fair bit of it.  I've had monsters shatter with much less cold damage in setups before?

  
Is it just the skill is considered physical so it doesn't have the effect or something?

Current skill gem lvling setup is:  Ice Crash &gt; Inc Aoe &gt; MultiStrike &gt; Pulverise &gt; Elemental Damage with attacks &gt; Melee Physical

fpzt1b,obscurehamster,I really like this league despite all the negatives,"Normally i am just a lurker and i dont post or comment on anything but i want to say how much i actually like this league.  I understand that there are people that dont like to back track or they dont like zooming through maps but for me this league has been nothing but fun.  Even when the delirium was buffed like crazy and it was super rippy, i play on softcore so obv for HC players that was a problem, but that was engaging and fun for me. I havent been playing POE for long, only a few seasons and i never play to the end of a season, but isnt like every build fast? I have never prioritized speed on a single build but just getting a quicksilver flask + 30% movement speed on boots + a movement ability makes me go through the maps pretty fast no matter the main skill i am using. 

I dont know everything about delirium and what it brings to the maps in terms of increased quantity/quality while the delirium is active but i dont really get that far into the delirium in a map. When i see a delirium portal i dont kill any mobs around it, i pop the portal and then i kill whats around it and like 1 other screen and you are already at 2 of the first drop most of the time.  You kill 1-2 more screens and you are at 3 with 1 of a second drop. Most maps i only get to 4/2 of the first 2 drops. I have a fully kitted character and also 53 exalts and a crazy amount of the other currency. Again i am fairly new to the game so for me thats a TON of currency and all of it was just from killing t-16 bosses at the end of the map and getting synth maps and items that sell for a lot. For me delirium is usually closed by then so thats just the reg map mods. From the delirium itself i havent gotten any crazy drops from it and i have only gotten about 3-5 exalts to drop from it. I think most of the people are giving too much credit to the drops of the delirium (in a reg map).  I have never seen the delirium being anything other than a fun encounter, the constant stuff you have to dodge, the random bosses that spawn, and the increased amount of mobs on the map, all of that is super fun to deal with imo and this league is really fun for me.

The delirium orbs that you apply to maps are also crazy fun, you dont have to rush it since there is no timer and you can make it as hard as you want and really test out your min/maxed builds.  The reason i usually quit a league is because i run out of content. After Killing the final boss, sirus, on awakened 8, or uber elder or w/e the season boss is at the time, i run out of spark to keep it going. I could make a new build but then i would just be doing what i already did on my previous character but with different buttons. The delirium league for me extends the play time for which i will get bored. Trying to complete higher maps with more delirious%  is extending the life of the league for me. 

With the backtracking to pick up loot i dont really have anything for that.  I dont usually have to back track but i use leap slam so i can kinda just leap to the item and pick it up and not really be worried of death, if there are tons of mobs still there ill just kill the mobs first then loot. At the beginning of the league i was always trying to get the highest drop count from the delirium as possible but after getting to red maps and getting more awakened levels, i completely stopped caring about how far i go into the delirium per map. So for me to back up a few feet to pick up loot its whatever. The only problem i had were the splinters since after they buffed the drop chance they were sometimes dropping like crazy and that was a lot to loot during the event but now that it drops at the end with the loot explosion i dont have any complaints with it. 

I understand that for some of you this league has been frustrating but i would just say to try to ignore  maxing out the drops from the delirium and just try to enjoy the fight. Dont focus on how much loot you can get from it but how to maneuver the mechanics and stay alive. Again these are my thoughts from a relatively new player and i could have the delirium so wrong that i am just not doing it right and it actually drops a crazy amount of stuff but that has not been the case for me 1 time and even then this has been my best league for currency/drops. I am sorry if my sentence structure doesnt make any sense or some things i say dont make any sense, i dont really post much. Thank you for reading my post and i hope you all have a bountiful league.",35,1585325792,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpzt1b/i_really_like_this_league_despite_all_the/,pathofexile,2

fpzgxv,legiononeps4,Request: purchasable porter for loot,"So the quick and easy of this post so you don’t have to read my rambling, I would like to see the intragration of a npc that follows you around picking up loot.

So if you have played Poe for more then a minute you know inventory management is key and space comes at a premium. One of the worst things imo of this game is the crazy amount of “trash” loot left lying on the ground, trash what can be easily converted into valuable currency when sold to the vendor. There’s two problems though when looking at the trash on the ground one who has time to be bothered to pick it up, and two there no possible way to get everything within six portals and backpacks worth of trips. So I’m coming to this community to suggest (I’m sure this is not an original or first time said idea) the integration of an npc that follows you around and picks up items that fall on the ground.

So there are two ways I can see this feature ring brought in as. The first and easiest way would be create a premium npc pet that you can buy additionally, ggg can incorporate stash tabs for purchase to the porter like your stash box and give a base porter out as a quest npc.I know this could be called a pay to win feature and ggg seams to be against that so I have one other idea. The second is create a new minion skill gem let’s call it “mule” that has no attribute or level requirements to use and is a white gem like portal. I don’t want to go to far into breaking this idea down but it could level up and gain backpack space with each level and increase the radius of pick up range as it levels.

I could keep blabbering on about this and different features like having the npc only pick up items that are in your loot filter, but the post is getting too long for my liking so I’ll stop here. Please do let me know good or bad what you think of this idea.

fpz201,Kryt0s,Can someone explain why Conqueror Influence is not spawning for me?,"Hey guys, I skipped the last two leagues and am a bit confused by the new atlas. 

I understand that if I want to spawn a missing conqueror I need to 1) socket the amount of watchstones required and that 2) I need to run the correct tier of map for the amount of stones I have socketed. 

Now here is my problem: 

I want to spawn the blue and yellow conqueror in Valdo's Rest. [As you can see here, it says I need 0 watchstones to spawn either one.](https://i.imgur.com/14X0Nvm.jpg) So I ran around 10 maps of the correct tier but nothing happened. I then though that maybe I needed to socket the watchstones I had already obtained. So I did and ran a view tier 9 Graveyards. Again, nothing happened. 

I heard about the hideout bug so I changed my hideout (not sure if this bug is still around) but that did not help either. 

I also checked Zana and Kirac if they had a conqueror encounter for me which was blocking any new influence from spawning.

I'm honestly just really confused and frustrated with the lack of ingame information regarding the atlas.",2,1585323521,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpz201/can_someone_explain_why_conqueror_influence_is/,pathofexile,2
fpz1qp,Areophany,Debate: Stacking of Notables is only really problematic for a subset of Builds and should only be removed for them.,"Title gives basics. Stacking notables like the aura effect on Herald's, extra HoP and HoAg have to go with 3.11. They'd have to balance the skills around them and therefor ruin them for the majority of the player-base who can't afford those notables on multiple jewels. It is therefore good for them to go. Arguably extra Impale also falls into that category although you might make an argument for diminishing returns there.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this subset of builds should NOT define notable stacking for the majority of builds, because it isn't problematic for most of them. I've played an ignite build these days and I'm absolutely loving how nicely you can optimize them now. I'm working my way towards 3 million shaper dps on Fireball Ignite. This is enabled through stacking some of the better ignite notables (3x Burning Bright, 2x Blowback). Ignite BESIDES Burning Arrow basically gets good damage numbers by having access to multiple notables. I am certain there are other sorta off-meta builds that benefit in a similar way.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR -&gt; the broken notable stacking should not define the whole system since a lot of other builds can stack them in a non-destructive manner to improve underplayed / underpowered builds without necessarily requiring multiple of them.",11,1585323499,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpz1qp/debate_stacking_of_notables_is_only_really/,pathofexile,1

I realized that the Nr 1 reason for me quitting PoE in a season is that i am tired of stashing everything i find. Every single piece of currency/splitter/essence and so on, with every league the list goes on. Its not fun. Seriously, is anyone having fun with that? I feel like it is a chore and i just cant understand why they dont do ANYTHING at all to make it less a chore, but more fun. 

Even implementing something that would automatically sort my inventory just a little bit would be a major improvement. I love doing maps, i love looting. But man, i really hate this chore to sort everything into my stash. It has come so far that i started not picking up certain things and instantly sell uniques without checking them.

I've read lots of posts of ppl complaining about the performance issues. I've been playing almost 4 years in a row, and performance is getting worst every league. As an IT guy, who has worked in development companies, I'm wondering how are you guys at GGG testing and developing your game? It's impossible that every league, has even worst performance, something must be wrong there. 

GGG says (And Chris also) that they think HC is the real game, I doubt about that. Even streamers (Like Zizaran, Mathil, etc) are in the same state of the game on which performance and lack of QOL ingame stuff (like hotkey to stop delirium) are a major issue. I want to know srsly who plays delirium in GGG without a hotkey in HC, who can move mouse cursor to the arrow while getting hit by 20 delirium mobs in a 100% delirium map, who?.

As per the league itself, I'm skipping it. I refuse to keep playing a game that crashes, has a lot of bugs, has performance issues, its not fun anymore. Maybe next league, things will be better in this terms, and i'll give it another shot.

fpx838,Markleblatt,Animate Weapon QoL AoE summon?,"Playing Animate Weapon Necro this league, and it's pretty fun.  Clear is decent (not amazing) but boss DPS is bonkers.

My one complaint is the setup at the beginning of a map (getting all the blades up) and having to continuously pause to summon a few more periodically via loot filter.  For a league where it's dangerous to stand still to loot, it's also dangerous to stand still to target a particular item to animate.  

It would be nice if Animate Weapon would animate all lingering blades in a small area so that I don't have to cast for each individual blade out of ~17.  You'd still have to do this if you want to target a particular item on the ground, which is fine, but it would be nice if it shared the same functionality as Blade Blast where it detonates all lingering blades.  Could you imagine if you had to blast every blade individually?

Other than that, it's a nice active playstyle juggling flame dashes, occasional bladefall for more blades, convocating minions over, buffing with flesh offering, flasks, etc.",1,1585316903,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpx838/animate_weapon_qol_aoe_summon/,pathofexile,1

fpwx9q,Eclune,Discharge bug with Forbidden Power,"TLDR:
Me use Discharge. Forbidden Power give Power Charge. Discharge use Power Charge. Power Charge gone. Discharge no do Lightning Damage. 

[Discharge](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Discharge) is an active spell skill gem that spends all of your (frenzy/power/endurance) charges to deal damage, adding bonus damage per charge. It consumes all of your charges *when damage is dealt*, no sooner and no later, allowing you to gain charges as a result of the skill's hit. Additionally, it cannot be cast if you have no charges to spend. Works pretty well. 


[Forbidden Power](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Forbidden_Power_\(Ascendancy_passive_skill\)) is an Occultist Ascendancy node that grants this line:

    Gain a Power Charge after Spending a total of 200 Mana

Which straightforwardly gives a power charge whenever you spend a total of 200 mana. If you spend 200 or more mana at once, you always gain one power charge and no more. Also cool. 

So here I am, an Occultist with [Voll's Devotion
](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Voll's_Devotion) and a decent ""[chance that if you would gain Power Charges, you instead gain up to your maximum number of Power Charges](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Inya%27s_Epiphany)"", using a 200 mana cost Discharge. I expect this to happen:

1. I have 3 endurance charges
2. I Use Discharge, spending 200 mana
3. I gain a power charge from Forbidden Power, sometimes gaining my maximum number (7) instead
4. Discharge hits, dealing some fire and some lightning damage
5. I crit because it's important to crit! (really)
6. I ignite and shock the enemy, something I wouldn't have been able to do had I not crit due to my 0% chance to ignite and shock

Alright, so what's the bug? Well, apparently, at step 4 above, everything goes wrong. Discharge *doesn't* do lightning damage, but only fire damage. No shock is applied. 

[Discharge with 3E and 7P initially](https://streamable.com/z4fui)
[Discharge with 3E initially, 7P gained from mana spent](https://streamable.com/nobpx)

What I think is happening:  

* Discharge decides how much damage to deal at the beginning of the cast, before mana is spent
* Discharge consumes all charges at the instant damage is dealt, regardless of whether those charges were counted in the damage calculation",2,1585315683,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpwx9q/discharge_bug_with_forbidden_power/,pathofexile,1

Delete the folders ""CachedHLSLShaders"" and ""ShaderCacheD3D11\_GI""  
(This might be a good time to clear your logs, so delete your logs folder aswell)

Your game will stutter a little harder the first 10-20 minutes, because it needs to cache shaders again, but most likely you will notice some improvements afterwards. Just run some T1 maps until the game cached most shaders again.

**2. Try Process Lasso to reduce CPU Load in processor-heavy situations**  
Alot of the stutter and lags is produced by too heavy load on your CPU. Thats the reason, why turning off Multi-Threading is helping so much people. I completely fixed my stuttering by using Process Lasso, which automatically adjusts process settings, when a process is overloading your threads.

Process Lasso can be downloaded free from here: [https://bitsum.com/](https://bitsum.com/) (Never trust any executables offered by strangers btw, do your own research before blindly downloading stuff). Process Lasso will most likely handle anything on its own, so theres no really need to setup anything. If you don't know what you're doing, its fine to just click next every time in the setup.

You may want to right-click your poe\_64.exe though and enable performance mode on this particular process.

**3. Change your Network Mode to Lockstep, if you're experiencing rubber banding, especially with skills like Flame Dash**  
Do so, by going to the Login-Screen of PoE, go into your settings and change Networking Mode to Lockstep in the UI tab. If your connection isnt very stable, you might be better off using predictive, otherwise lockstep will most likely solve your rubberbanding.

I hope those fixes make the game playable again for atleast some people.",17,1585312136,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpw3ao/psa_some_possible_fixes_for_your_performance/,pathofexile,1

fpvrmq,TexusDark,Useless build : 90% less damage taken will leeching,"Hi!

Today I present to you my unnecessary build, 90% less damage taken will leeching.

How does it work?

Simple, I use the Lethal Pride's Keystone : Strength of Blood where for every 2% of my maximum total recovery is transformed to 1% less damage taken.

So in this PoB : [https://pastebin.com/QZhHVJsn](https://pastebin.com/QZhHVJsn)

With the new clusters jewels, im searching for ""maximum total life recovery per second from life leech"" and we have 2 of them : Adrenaline and Drive Destruction

But i also use the notable from the berserker ascendancy : Pain Reaver for extra 50%

And finally i took Vaal Pact for 100% more.

So at the final i have 160% maximum total life recovery so 80% less damage taken.

But but but ! We can also add Fortify that add 20% less damage taken from hit so : 0.2 \* 0.8 : 0.16 (84%)

We can also add enfeeble and with the new curse clusters jewels we can have an enfeeble increased by 70% so the less damage taken from Unique and Rare goes of 15% to 25.5%.

So : 0.2 \* 0.8 \* 0.745 = 0.12 (88%) in theory.

But if we want to max this we can add Dread Banner that at the max stage when used gives us 100% increased fortify effect so 40% less damage taken.

At the end we have : 0.2 \* 0.6 \* 0.745 : 0.0894 (91,06%)

We can have perma 91,06% less damage taken with Soul Tether that allow the life leech to continue at full life.

This build is useless for mapping but it was fun to make, searching for 100% less damage taken seems impossible but if you have other idea to add more ""less damage taken"" im in !",5,1585310650,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpvrmq/useless_build_90_less_damage_taken_will_leeching/,pathofexile,1

What they meant by 'we want to slow down the speedclearing meta' was actually making every non-meta builds to dumpster and adding crap load of backtracking time, so in the long run people spend more time in the map backtracking and not killing the mobs.

I still love this game and do enjoy it, but I can feel that GGG is becoming way too over confident about their theory (for instance, timer meta ffs)

Active communication with the users is great, but if there are so many negative feedback, first thing you need to do is revisiting what you are doing in the fundamental level.. not just keep pushing your misconception to people.

you know what's the best case?

least amount of communication between company and user base because the game is GREAT.

Why is it good? You get to run your favorite master missions more! you still can do every master. This prevents non-favored missions by players to stack up.

This way a delver gets more Sulphite and enjoys the delving more. A person who loves syndicate can progress more, can use Zana for map completion more. With no downside.

I am a new player who never reached maps during a season before, so I am using this season to learn.

My objective is to reach the Tanky version of the King of all summoners build, and while doing so I am understanding that the writer of the guide has access to items that are extremely overpowered and expensive.

How do I progress from here?

I have in stock 34 chaos (I should probably start selling what I don't need)

In my stash I  have a 5 gems, 5 linked , iLvl 71 white Warstaff. SHould I try to craft somehting out of it?

Or should I try instead to buy a new Femurs of the saints with 5 links?

You can play at your own pace, no need of worrying about backtracking (after they quickly made the organs auto-pickup), and the existence of a second boss after each map just feel so good. Not to mention the markings of all elite packs and bosses on the minimap, that was pure QoL goodness.

(I REALLY don't like the animation lock of minefield. following [this guide](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2636456) loosely, the conversion to fire is nice for on death effects.)


plus the aforementioned 27ex.


I'd like to get to the point where I can if not one shot those bosses at least kill them extremely fast, and if I can get a lot more tanky in the process so I can grind to 100 through delirium and clear 100% delirium maps I'll take it.


fhe question is : how do I achieve that? since it's my first time playing miner, I'm probably missing a lot there...


any advice appreciated!",6,1585297081,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpt9my/i_have_a_geared_bl_miner_27ex_and_i_want_woke_8/,pathofexile,1

fps2mc,MasterZalm,Delirium league is awful.,"I obviously share this sentiment with many other players, as see in the GGG forums as well as the reddit. This league is the first time I have ever decided to ignore the league mechanics, actively avoid them if possible. Even after apparently 3-4 patches to try to fix some of the delirium aspects, such as damage amount, enemy numbers, animations, on-death enemies, etc, the league is just...sub par. Any and every league I have ever played has always been either good, or meh, and I played during the Closed Beta. I have seen bad mechanics within a good league. I have seen amazing mechanics within a lack luster league. I have been seen rougue exiles when the first released, and I have played a part of the build a boss mini game.

But Never, and I mean **Never** have I avoided a league mechanic in its entirety. I'll avoid certain leagues during leveling, like the Harbinger League. Wasnt very worthwhile to fight the enemies until mapping, but then it was a blast. Sometimes I avoid certain mechanics due to map mods, because I will be damned if I fight in a Bestiary map with a Beyond mod. Or Fleet. Ive even avoided certain leagues at end game, but used them alot during leveling, like the Incursion stuff. I do not like the map mechanics of incursion (and generally avoid Alva as a master as well).

But Delirium has got me avoiding the mechanics in both mapping, and leveling, no matter the mods. Being rushed past loot, in order to sustain the mist, never being allowed to stop, or risk getting killed (even with something as tanky as a max block, or RF build), and essentially being made to run an area three times, or a map twice, just to loot after killing has run its course of how interesting the league is. And honestly, many times, the loot isnt worth it. Chests, Rings, Weapons, and assorted(boxes) always end up dropping trash, way wrse than the gear on the map itself. Currency is always Alchemy, Chromatics, Scours, or other low end trash. Uniques never drop anything of real value, and end up always being vendor trash. As much as I love the perandus coins, and you get a decent amount, its not usually worth the risk involved. The rest of the rewards are exceptionally bitter tasting, and never worth it.

And all in all, the worst part about this? I love the challenge unlocks for this league. Each one is simply amazing, and for the first time in years, I want to try for all 3. Want, being the key word. I want to try, but I wont. I'll end up grabbing the first, lower tier, and nothing more. Because this league has got me avoiding it worse than the plague. I was interested in the story behind it, but not any more. I was interested in the new Breach like mechanics, but not anymore. I was interested in the challenges, but not anymore.

Oh, but thanks for the Jewel Clusters. Most of my builds end at 60-70, so I get 20+ skill points usually spent on BS, but now have a purpose.

Seriously... the longer you take to fix the performance the harder it will be to turn PoE into a real top-quality game. 
The only reason people still come back to PoE is because the game design itself is great and the game is fun in good conditions, but the end game itself, which should be the most important part of the game for player retention in my opinion, is having lots of troubles keeping up with all the different effects, monsters, etc.  

If Poe 2 ( 4.0 ... whatever it will be called ), aims to be the next generation of arpg we need huge performance improvements asap.

fpqxuh,SVNihilism,Purposeful Harbinger Needs Addressing,"Bex has made comments that this will not be nerfed until next league, however it's completely unethical and broken in its current state. I don't even think it's arguable that it's the most broken mechanic to ever exist in PoE, and if there is an example of an ability that would need to be live patched it would be this.  


I think there's plenty of room of toning it down without completely bricking the ability. First we could address it buffing specific abilities:

Tailwind 

Harbinger of Time

Golem Buffs

Shaper's Presence

Guardian added aura effects

&amp;#x200B;

Or it could just be changed to read:  10% increased Effect of Auras on You if a Herald is affecting you or 10% increased Effect of Auras on You for each Herald affecting you, up to 50-100%   


A 400%+ increase to auras is just too much, and any backlash a live patch would cause would outweigh the consequences of allowing it to continue to exist. You're almost forced to play it in some form (flow untethered is budget version, HH being optimal) because it's so overwhelmingly better than any other build that it's almost a waste of your time to map with anything else. Especially with how versatile it is, most people can make harbinger versions of what they are already running to trivialize any content.  


I understand many people have sunk a lot of currency into it already, and you're going to have a lot of unhappy people, but it's pretty much unanimous among people using it that it's just silly at this point and probably should be changed as soon as possible.",60,1585284754,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpqxuh/purposeful_harbinger_needs_addressing/,pathofexile,1

fpq6qj,luminoray,Any fixes for laggy instances?,"It now seems that half the instances I create now are extremely laggy.

The lag is tied to the instance, as if I enter a map the ping skyrockets, but inside hideout everything is buttery smooth. This can also be replicated in delve, since a new instance is created when accessing a node, and sometimes it runs fine, and remains that way, and sometimes it just unplayable, in which case I just go back to hideout and back to the node, which recreates the instance.

I can't do this in maps however, since I can't recreate the map instance, which basically means that map is essentially bricked, and also lost my Sirus instance to this.

After looking this issue up, it seems that a possible issue is that sometimes the game creates an instance in a server to which you have very inefficient network routing, which is what causes the lag to that specific instance. Also found that when such an instance is created, other players may still have a smooth connection to it.

Is there anyone that used to have this problem and managed to solve it somehow? Like changing DNS or whatever.

fppq5i,SeanLandDGeorge,Reach Epilogue for the first time and as an ARPG 'veteran' but I have some questions.,"Hi Reddit.  
So, as title says, for the first time, I got through Act 1 to 10 and reached Epilogue. I've an ARPG fan with about 1500 hours spread across Grim Dawn, Diablo 3, Van Helsing and other smaller games and this is the first I got the sink my teeth into the game, as the first time I played, some time ago, the game didn't have a 5th act.  
I do however have some questions/observations from playing that I hope folks can answer.  


1: Is it just me that find bosses absolutely infuriating and unfun? Playing through the game, the numeros boss fights were easily my least favorite parts. I love the dungeons, I love mass clearing but I absolutely hated 90% of the boss fights. It feels like the bosses are all needlessly tanky and repetitive and slow and dull. For example, in Act 9, I'm fairly sure I spent more time in boss fights than the rest of the act. Am I doing something wrong?  


2: Why is respeccing so incredibly costly? One of my joys of games like Diablo and Grim Dawn is reaching endgame and then mix/maxing, fine tuning or entirely respecing my characters for different situations and bosses. In Diablo 3, I'll regularly rotate armour sets and abilities to keep things fresher and in Grim Dawn I will full reset quite often just to go at the bosses and skeleton key dungeons with a fresh loadout. However, I notice in Path of Exile, its is INCREDIBLY punishing to build 'incorrectly' or respec at all and I wonder if theres a reason for this? I originally started this league on a Witch, got to 52, my build really badly fell off and I stopped enjoying myself, only to realise that I couldn't respec properly and ended up starting again (I came pretty close to just quitting there and then). Have the developers ever spoken about why this is the case?  


3: Rare and Elite mobs feel really unrewarding and paintful. In Diablo, especially at endgame, I will always actively search out Rares and Elites for currency, drops and other such stuff. Similarly, in Grim Dawn I know I'm almost always guaranteed something good from rares and elites. However, in PoE it feels, almost like a waste of time, having to stop and kill a rare who'll take 3x longer than the mobs around him, only to not get any specific currency or items guaranteed. I don't think I've ever gotten a unique or something off a rare I've got ""wow"" at and ESPECIALLY in delirium, it feels like a total waste of time to kill anything higher than a normal mob. Is it just me or am I doing something wrong?  


4: Are there plans for an ""adventure mode""? After this season, it is very likely I will NOT play Path of Exile again, primarily because I will have to go through Act 1 to 10 AGAIN and unless whatever mechanic is in the next league dramatically changes something, I wont be able to keep attention. Diablo's adventure mode allow me to jump straight into lategame content, at just about any point in the season and I wonder if PoE ever intends to add something like this?  


Just some thoughts and questions, I've had alot of fun with some of my friends and had a polite time with some folks I've traded with in game, thanks very much Reddit! :D",27,1585279319,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fppq5i/reach_epilogue_for_the_first_time_and_as_an_arpg/,pathofexile,1

fppndg,ManyNiinjas,I'm afraid Reddit's criticisms could steer PoE away from Chris and Jonathans initial philosophies,"As the title states, I'm afraid that Reddit's criticisms will eventually steer this game away from Chris and Jonathan's initial philosophies. So many of the threads I see here revolve around making the game easier to play and more ""convenient"". I know a game just like this, it's called Diablo 3. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not naive enough to believe that this game has zero problems and with quality of life improvements it will suddenly become another Diablo 3. I think we're far from that ever happening and many improvements are most certainly needed. I'm more concerned with complaints about ""clear speed meta"", picking up items and trade.

If GGG significantly slows the game down, many veteran players and anyone used to the ""feeling"" of PoE in general will likely not enjoy the new pace of gameplay. Seriously, I've been playing this game for years and a slower pace will honestly just feel like shit in most cases (maybe this can change in PoE 2 but not the current game). 

Also I agree, picking up items in most cases is inconvenient and sucks. Especially do to the ""clear speed meta"" mentioned above. But I think this is more a problem with how 99% of the items that drop in PoE are filler items. There's a lot of garbage in this game and while I think it's necessary to have bad items to amplify the feeling of getting good ones, PoE takes this to the extreme (GGG has talked about this, maybe it will change?). Regardless, any type of auto-pickup option is an awful idea for this game. Items should have weight, it gives them more significance. While that may be inconvenient it's necessary to the core ""feeling"" of playing PoE. Again improvements can be made but they should be just that, improvements.

Now let's talk about trade. I'm a huge outlier on this one and I accept that. I actually don't mind PoEs current system of trade. I don't think an ""auction house"" will improve the experience of PoE at all. I think it will significantly ruin the experience by making the game too convenient (maybe this too can be fixed with an item system change?). Now Ironically many of the players that complain about ""clear speed meta"" want an auction house. This seems counter intuitive to me. If we want the game to slow down why would we implement a feature that significantly speeds it up. I've played many games with auction houses, I don't play those games any more for a reason. It becomes stale fast and often the top 1% of players control a significant portion of market. Also that juicy item you got suddenly drops in value and becomes less juicy because their everywhere and everyone has them. That sounds terrible to me.

I agree that PoEs current state isn't great and a lot of improvements can be made. To me much of the game feels bloated now and certain systems feel like they simply just don't belong. There's just too much going on and that kind of gives PoE this unpolished feeling. But I fell in love with this game for reasons mentioned above. And I just hope that some of these core mechanics don't change too drastically as the game evolves and Reddit's complaints continue to pop up here. Change needs to be slow and steady because one wrong move and your closer than ever to becoming a Wolcen. Yikes.

My initial thoughts are the Templar, both for the lore-y quality of the archetype but also the safer, more remote playstyle. Definitely not cycloning on an HC char... Would glacial totems be a good fit? I *hate* the mine/trap playstyle, and already have a brand build on another toon.

Any good HC guides/builds I could follow, as I'd be jumping in blind and also usually die a lot to taking on way too much? Does this essentially mean avoid mechanics/delirium the entire leveling journey? 

Really, my main goal is to stop and smell the roses. There's so much rich storytelling and development here, and I'm kind of tired of rushing maps and having no idea who tf Piety is or what all is going on with Innocence etc other than killing them all a thousand times.

fpnk03,kichr,Better herald of agony and herald of purity sustain,"I´ve been trying to do both of these builds (separately) with the new notables ""Pure Agony"" and ""Disciples"", and I've been struggling to sustain both skills, even when I do my builds around mostly damage.  


**Hoag:** With 6 additional pure agonies and disciples, I could theoretically get to 70 virulence (6 pure agonies), but even with 180% (6 disciples) slower virulence decay, I can't get to 70 on single target. Maybe we could have more ways on the tree, or new notables so that virulence easier sustain? The trade-off would be not being able to invest so much in defenses, since more then half the tree are on 2 Voices + 2 Medium cluster + 2 small cluster jewels. Didn't have the time to level a path finder to get another 50% slower virulence decay to see if it gets any better, but then I'd lose all Necro benefits for minions.

**HoP:** In minion builds, as far as I know, its hard to get the damage to kill monsters yourself and summon sentinels of purity. Usually we need to use zombies/holy relic/something else to help clear, but that gets really bad/slow in red maps. Unless we try to do something hybrid, the skill just summon sentinels in bosses, and still they de-spawn too quickly and slow to summon again, making it hard to sustain 10 sentinels of purity. Maybe we could spawn them when our minions kill monsters, or for the kills we have ""kill participation"" or something, that would help a lot already, even with sentinels summoned the clear would not but that fast, maybe it would be comparable to a Skeletons + Holy relic build in terms of clear, with similar single target.  


I'm not trying to use them both at the same time and having everything on them ramped-up, but at least it could be possible in builds 100% focusing on one of those skills.  


Also, can we have virulence decay numbers/formula? How much 180% virulence reduction helps? Or 230%? They fall-off really quickly even with all the investment.",6,1585270571,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpnk03/better_herald_of_agony_and_herald_of_purity/,pathofexile,1

fpnf4w,Shadruh,GGG shifty about mid league nerfs,"GGG claims that they don't nerf builds mid-league, which is a lie.

Yes, HOAG was nerfed preleague, which we all knew about.  However, investing in the new jewels allowed HOAG to reach higher virulence levels.  I spent A LOT of currency investing in a HOAG build.  After the first week and patch they nerfed that interaction to cap HOAG at 40 without the agony notable.  Okay, I was disappointed in that and it completely gutted HOAG to the point where it wouldn't even kill map 7 bosses.

fpndox,GregoryOwO,I miss speaking to Alva,"Remember when you found Alva and you opened your little temple map, and she offered you the choice to decide between upgrading your room to Level 2 Breach room or changing to Level 1 Currency room? 

Remember stopping for a moment from your blood-thirsty, merciless killing to think for a second about how you want to set-up your temple? Weighing the value of your temple room choices and all that?

&amp;nbsp;

Now think about how uncomfortable the feeling is that EVERY SINGLE SECOND you spend *not* killing, you're missing out on a reward? Knowing making the wrong choice in a moment of urgency may also lead to you missing out on a reward.

&amp;nbsp;

Alas, we need to back-track anyway right? So we SKIP THE ALVAS, get the Delrium reward, run back, pick up our stuff and set-up our temples.

I don't care if PoE2 gets postponed 6 months, but are we stuck with this shitshow of an endgame fight until who the fuck knows?

It's impossible to see 90% of stuff due to red red red color pallete, he gets offscreen every single fucking time. If you are playing in melee range, get fucked cause you have to run for 10 minutes to hit the guy for 2 seconds. His beams are so large, wide and are placed so randomly that sometimes you end up in a 2mm corner with nowhere to run or dodge. I don't even wanna start on the labyrinth aoe attacks and on the random teleports to fucking Narnia.
 
I'm asking please, please make this a top priority issue. Imagine someone who can't play 4-5 hours a day to reach this fight in 1 or 2 months time and fight this mess.
If you can't fix the fight atm, I'm sure you could revert it to its last state before 3.10, keep the damage increase, heck buff the life if you want. But the core endgame fight of an ARPG shouldn't be this bad.

I saw the tag mirrored and I did not think much of it. After spending 200c to buy one, I tried to scour my new base and found out that we cannot modify mirrored items. 

I know I wasn't necessarily scammed, but just feel down that there's other players making a profit in uninformed casual players like me. Its not a terrible amount of currency lost, but it still hurts. I just wanted to make a PSA for casual players like me so others may learn from my mistake.

fplwy0,aphelion_perihelion,Idea for POE2: on-death player helplessness/ragdolling,"One thing that's always been a sort of morbid fascination for me in video games is the sense of despair and helplessness at watching what happens to the player character at the instant they die and in the moments after. Most games handle this by playing some kind of player death animation and/or sound, but otherwise the action stops and enemies &amp; environmental effects either walk away or stand there, maybe sometimes they’ll heckle or respond to the player death.

Check out this collection of death / failure scenes from the game INSIDE:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guTsQXIs4Pw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guTsQXIs4Pw)

Whenever the player dies (in all the various ways there are to die in that game), there is an elaborate, played out aftermath showing the player character being ravaged by animals, strangled, or dead and lifeless as things fall or move around them. The body ragdolls, flails, convulses, struggles before succumbing, and otherwise provides a very real, visceral experience of the player character in and after their final moments living and fighting.

I’m reminded a little of the death scenes in Path of Exile’s Sacrifice of the Vaal trailer, which I thought were really cool:
[https://youtu.be/6dxx8NNxROE](https://youtu.be/6dxx8NNxROE) The zoomed-in effect of the player characters being surrounded and falling to enemies is really intense and cinematic and I'd love to see it taken a step further.

I think it would totally fit in the dark, gritty theme of POE for, when the player character dies, to be shown getting ravaged, soul siphoned, cut up, tossed around / ragdolled, or whatever other insanity you guys can think of in POE2. Imagine Kitava killing the player, then scooping their corpse up and eating it (a la the painting “*Saturn Devouring his Son*” by Francisco Goya https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Devouring_His_Son ). It’d make for some awesome cinema. I’m not sure how it’d play out in party play but that’s a technical / gameplay design hurdle I’m sure GGG can work around.",0,1585264527,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fplwy0/idea_for_poe2_ondeath_player/,pathofexile,1

fpkgq4,yellowpainIG,Why bother with too much mob density ?,"GGG knows very well whether or not their leagues are going to be laggy. 

They disabled beyond for blight, the manifesto during blight talked about the sheer amount of monsters causing too many calculations which resulted in lag. And finally before delirium league Chris had to say this https://gyazo.com/281234e1e1e7e43244a13e067965f93f . The same mistake that was made for blight was made for delirium. Too many monsters that take a while to die.

They knew very well that the league was going the be incredibly laggy and yet decided to go with a very high density of monsters.

Im a Slayer Flicker Striker currently flickering with a Terminus Est. I heard that the DMG of the Terminus is weak so im looking for ways to change it.

I tried gaining Frenzy Charges with self inflict bleeding jewel, the boots (FC while bleeding) and changed the sword to unique Ezomyte. The damage was definitely better but i kept dying randomly because of bleed... Forget to use flask one time and youre dead. Get attacked by a monster and youre dead. Thats not it for me. I have 1800 armor and the bleeding dmg is just insane.

Are there other ways gaining Frenzy Charges consistently? I couldnt find anything on google.

fpjxva,Utlegjarl,"Why must there be ""loot explosion"" at all? Remove the core problem itself - unnecessary loot!","So there's been a lot of discussions and heated concerns regarding several delirium aspects. One of these concerns is the topic of loot explosions - and the issue of having to pick up items and risk a high chance of dying, or backtrack. 

So, we've been told that loot explosions are an issue. Even so, we still get a massive amount of loot currently. So much loot, that everyone (have) to use loot filters to filter out bad loot. We only pick up a tiny amount of loot in the later game, yet it drops a massive amount.

I propose that loot should be scaled upwards in map/monster levels, and reduced accordingly. Lower tiers of magic/rares, items even the most basic filters remove. It'll save up a lot of resources, and make space for the possibility of better looting options. 

TLDR: Remove filters. No, I'm kidding. Still need them. 

Correct me if I'm looking at this wrong though. My two thoughts. I love this game, and really enjoy Delirium so far by the way.

fpjbiy,spezz,[Suggestion] How I think delirium encounter could be made better.,"These changes would allow players with slower builds to interact with the mechanic, and would allow faster builds to loot without worrying about falling behind. 

1. Remove the fog timer. When you enter the delirium portal, the map/area acts as if a Delirium Orb were active on it.

2. Reduce the base reward multiplier, since speed is no longer part of the equation.

3. Instead of making difficulty proportional to progress made in the map/area, spawn fog containing plants/eggs (whatever fits the theme) throughout the map. Stepping on these would increase the difficulty (fog density) and reward multiplier. If the enemies are already too difficult you avoid stepping on these. This allows players to interact with the mechanic in a more consequential way.

4. How to end the delirium event would have to be thought about. The ""fast forward"" button could be used, but not sure if the button should be the only way for it to end. Maybe exiting the map/area or dying should end it.

So, a friend has gotten me into playing PoE since I can finally run it now, but the concept of hardcore mode is very enticing for me.

I'm going to be playing this game at a crawling speed since I really don't want to die, but the skill tree is intimidating and I guess as a support in other MMO's, I'd want to do the same here.

My question is: Is it possible to be a support or, at the very least, an aura bot with the Shadow or Duelist Class? They interest me the most in the character selection. Which skills should I work toward to? And is it possible to be a mage with either of them? While the witch would be the ideal mage since she is a mage starter, I wanted to have more of an unconventional build with a duelist or shadow...

fpgcr7,LegatusDivinae,"GGG, please give an alternative to story acts to level to maps","Since 2.1, my second league (I started playing in 2.0), I started dreaming about having ""adventure mode"" or something similar. As an alternative to levelling. 

And then 3.0 came. I had some fun. But then in 3.1 I started wishing for ""adventure mode"" or something similar, again.

You see, I hate levelling. Despite the fact that levelling is the same thing you do in maps, despite the fact that it's faster to relevel than to farm equivalent chaos to respec (and even then you're only limited to one class). Despite the fact that you can do it in 3 hours comfortably with twink gear. 

I know it's probably irrational and that I should listen to advice of ""just relevel, tabula+wanderlust and you are in maps in 3 hours or less"". But I hate it. I simply hate levelling. I recognize the finesse and speedrunning aspect. I recognize the possibility to improve and reach fairly achievable 2 hours or less.

But I simply hate levelling, and if I could have something like mindless infinite ledge or scaled down randomized maps, I'd love it.

So even though it probably won't happen -  I wish for an alternative to levelling, again.",6,1585245918,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpgcr7/ggg_please_give_an_alternative_to_story_acts_to/,pathofexile,0
fpgbts,jvtin7,Question: Need help with new character,"I returned to Path of Exile after a couple years of not playing. I am using [Enki's Arc Witch Guide](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1147951) for my first character, an elementalist witch using Arc as the primary damage skill. Currently, I am level 76, having just completed Act 10, but have not started maps.

My gear is all poor quality, just rares that I picked up along the way. For my damage setup, I'm using a 4 socket armor, not having found anything with 5 or 6 linked sockets yet.

However, I was proceeding fine until a level ago or so. My Arc damage was around 24k, I was killing mobs easily and hardly ever dying. I had saved about 10 passive skill points. Then after I completed Act 10, I assigned those passives [according to Enki's guide](https://pastebin.com/r3EEZjCa). My passives are now exactly as recommended for a level 80 character in the guide, *except* that I'm missing 4 points in staff-related skills leading to Serpent Stance (I'm still using 2 wands instead of a staff).

However, this new passive assignment has completely broken my character. The combination of Zealot's Oath, Mind Over Matter and Eldritch Battery means that I no longer have energy shield protecting my life pool, I have no life regeneration. Currently, my stats stand at 3273 life, 1256 mana (of which only 50 is available, the rest is reserved for Zealotry, Flesh to Stone, and Discipline). And I have a 1633 point energy shield protecting my mana.

The result is that without an energy shield for my life pool and without any life regeneration, I die to mobs I used to easily kill just one level ago. I'm not even talking about maps, I'm talked about level 65-66 mobs (10 or 11 levels below me) in delves. Just half an hour ago I died 7 times trying to clear an azurite node in a delve.

I'm having to mash my potion buttons constantly in every fight. Sometimes I can't mash them fast enough (or the potions run out), and then I die. This never happened before I reassigned passives. From level 1 to level 76 I died maybe 2 times total, both times by being lazy or careless, not because my character was weak. But after the passive reassignment, I can't even kill Act 10 mobs without risking death in every fight.

I was wondering if anyone has had experience following Enki's Guide and could tell me what I'm doing wrong. I mean, I expect the character will get stronger with better gear, but right now I'm looking at weeks of pain trying to get that better gear, because I'm dying in damn near every fight. That doesn't seem worth it. What am I doing wrong?

Any suggestions are much appreciated.",6,1585245843,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpgbts/question_need_help_with_new_character/,pathofexile,1
fpgav1,Dranzus,Need help with accuracy on burning arrow chieftain,"So, this league i tried one of my friends builds, a burning arrow chieftain with xoph's.

So far it's been awesome, but unfortunately, a gem he used (Tempered Mind) to fix the low accuracy of the build, no longer gives accuracy, and as such i'm left with an 80% chance to hit, which is pretty bad in harder maps...

Any idea how i can get some more without having to sacrifice my current stats/build? Precision is a no go due to mana pool restrictions, and gear kind of veers off the build path, so i'm not sure what to do,

fpe2e4,DrBirdie,Big ol' list of QOL changes,"**General** 

- Protective bubble when interacting with masters (reading) that makes you immune to damage and/or negate agro from monsters (so they don't pile up on you)
- Proximity shields need to either not reduce damage by 100% or be breakable after a threshold. 
- Remove shotgunning 
- Remove all doors or make them all auto open. Every time I'm in Cells I find myself wishing I was in a different map. 
- Make unidentified maps reveal after you finish them (kill boss?) to see what kind of mods you were dealing with. 
- All bosses, unique, and significant monsters (e.g. beyond bosses), need a minimap icon
- Beasts and legion (frozen) need to be more evident when you ""kill"" them, for beasts it could be as simple as making their icon go away as soon as the threshold is reached. 
- Notable monsters need to have their hp bars always shown (option in menu?) mouse over is garbage
- Map loot icons should be map wide. Could be an option in the menu to disable/enable 


**Syndicate**

- In game information on what each member does in each section. I am sick to death of having to alt tab and open up the spreadsheet.
- Option to do nothing (having the best option to be to walk away and losing encounters is just terrible) 
- When unveiling allow us to swap items from inventory without having to take out the one in the crafting slot first.  

**Blight** 

- 1 break halfway through blight maps (monsters stop or stop spawning) to allow you to breath  and setup towers, the breaks in simulacrum feel so good 
- Easier/different way to put up towers (bindable keys to erect/upgrade tower closest or under you). The current system is not adequate IMO


**Controversial changes**

- Auto sort items into unique stash tabs so only currency, cards, fragments, essence . There are too many different items to sort these days and it's only going to get worse 
- Increase pickup radius 
- Nerf map mods that delete builds (they should reduce effectiveness to test them not completely invalidate how they work). 
- Remove cannot regen mana map mod. While there is counterplay it just ends up being annoying/infuriating 
- Remove all reflect mods. With the amount of maps we get these days there is no reason to include this mod anymore as an incentive for people to sell maps. Also the whole  joke of ""haha he didn't read the mods, stupid streamer rip xd"" is overplayed af 
- Zana in map missions basically do nothing and are distracting (either make them give a tangible reward or remove them)",44,1585238649,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpe2e4/big_ol_list_of_qol_changes/,pathofexile,2

fpdq1h,PineappleDelivery,Is there something officially broken/wrong with the Delirium rewards?,"I know they're nerfing Harbour Bridge because, ostensibly, it was too rewarding.

But this morning I've completed ~20 T6-T7 maps, ALL juiced/alched up. I go straight to the mirror and kill 80-90% of mobs on the map (including all ""sacks""/pods and Delirium monsters), including the map boss when possible.

I ALMOST ALWAYS only get 4/2/0/0 rewards. And almost ALWAYS it's General/Armor/Weapon/Talisman/Jewelry rewards. ONCE I got to 5/3/0/0, but only because I had Alva show up.

Literally, I'm not joking, &gt;90% of these Delirium encounter rewards are worthless garbage. Meaning there is NOTHING valuable to pick up. Just rares, maybe the occasional 4x stack of chromes or a fusing. Usually get 2-4 Simulacrum splinters as well, which seems weirdly low.

Harbor Bridge was WAY more profitable/rewarding. Metamorph at these tiers was also WAY more rewarding.

What the hell is wrong? I kill practically everything killable, and my build is one of the faster ones available. I can't imagine what the slower builds are going through.

Is there something bugged with my character's RNG seed or something? Are they going to fix this? Or is this the designed reward system? Because it feels incredibly unrewarding.

4 hours of playing, and I have close to zero profit from it. I might as well just do delve this league...

----

Edit: Instead of downvoting if you're not experiencing this problem, then explain what you *are* experiencing. It's possible some users have artificially nerfed rewards, while others are not. Just like with 4-socket resonators in Delve league. It would be nice to know if some people *are NOT* experiencing this issue (if it is one).

Clearly there are plenty of players this league not getting past 4/2/0/0, and not getting any masters spawned in their maps (I've probably seen one master out of &gt;100+ maps).

fpdhsq,Philedermaus,Thoughts about the current state of the Awakener fight,"Yeah...another topic about the awaknener...yay...

(Technical issues aside, I'm sure GGG are aware of those and working on it)

I think most people here agree that in 3.9 the fight was too easy and the Awakener, as the ""final boss"" of the game, was to easy to kill, even on AL8, and needed some adjustements.

(When I talk about builds, I mean actual builds by people who know the game, not meme builds or something like that, you shouldnt be able to do a boss with a 1.5k life raider wearing abyssus and iron reflexes)

The fight by it's design favors certain build archetypes (i.e. DoT's, brands, minions, CI and LL, avoidance), for which it was just a pushover and disfavors others (true melee, life, mitigation), for which there was an actual challenge left.

The problem I have with the figt in it's current state is that the buff's Awa recieved, hit those builds the hardest, who where already struggling, while the favored ones are still easily able to do the fight (deathless, as many videos here show), and this divergence is the elephant in the room.

This results in a feeling of being punished for you preference of what kind of character you like. Of course there always are (have been and will be) stronger and weaker options out there but before it never felt so frustrating, the gap is widened to much.

I was childishly looking forward to the endgame and especially the Awakener runs, Grind your maps (with improvements to the atlas even) and every once in a while get a little treat in form of a cool boss fight and the chance of dropping something nice. Now every 20-30 maps you get a kick in the b\*\*\*s, and a ""haha, thats for liking what you like"". Really takes away my motivation to play at all

(English is not my native language, i hope you still understand what i say and get my point)

fpdfhr,Optimal_Version,Xbox Character Progression Tips? Following Enki's Arc Witch Build,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am curious how you would proceed with character development - upgrading items, etc.

Here's a direct link to my witch atm:  [https://www.pathofexile.com/account/xbox/view-profile/Dopish/characters](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/xbox/view-profile/Dopish/characters) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never progressed a character to maps, and I'm at a loss with how to find better gear upgrades. Using the trade market on Xbox almost seems impossible. If I want to find a 2h Staff to replace my wands for example, it seems like there are no ways to filter out the staffs so it shows the affixes i'm looking for. Are there websites for trading on Xbox as well or is the in-game trade market the best?

&amp;#x200B;

On a separate point - what items should I prioritize gear-wise? I think my wands could use an upgrade, and then my helm/rings/amulet and I know the general rule of thumb is ES + Resistances + Life. Anything I should be concerned about right off the bat?   


I have ran up to T6 maps with (relative) ease, and tried a T13 unique I had and definitely struggled (could kill blue mobs, got 1 shot by a rare)

&amp;#x200B;

I've also started running the Mine Delves with Nico - Enki says in his guide it's a great way to farm currency quickly, should i be focusing on any other masters in my hideout as well? Was never a fan of metamorph monsters, but what about incursions/syndicate stuff? Worth doing or just ignore for now?

fpd3iy,Troyaner7,A NEW FEATURE in PoE that will allow you to find out the exact DPS that your hero inflicts!,"Hello GGG, Reddit!

I know that you are really busy with new patches but I wanted to highlight my suggestion (which I tried to deliver to your top management on 28 February 2018).

You just can think about it and if it will be nice for you - just add this ticket to your JIRA's backlog or something.

So, as a rule, players find it difficult to accurately calculate the damage to monsters (for ex. impale, poison, etc)

Sometimes many factors are not taken into account while you are highlighting the skill and it is difficult to assess all the damage.

I suggest you create an immortal NPC in a shelter that players can do damage to check their damage per second (also, as many builds have mechanics which depends on the count of nearby enemies - give a possibility to create a few such NPC's).

Players will hit this NPC and the damage dealt will be highlighted above it. And will calculate the average damage for this immortal NPC. You already have all the functions needed to calculate damages and that's why I don't think it will be a problem.

You can add one more button for the player in the shelter (like the ""Edit"", ""Hideout"" button) and name it ""Damage test"". (or something like this).

In this mode, the player can set some parameters to his hero:  
\- charges (power, endurance, frenzy)  
\- buffs (fortify, herald, onslaught, etc) (or debuffs)  
\- flasks  
\- etc

I think many players will enjoy this.

fpckyd,GoGoGadgetTotems,Could someone help me understand how to progress in the new Atlas system without constantly having to buy maps?,"I've found myself having to buy almost every map I run this league, so I figured I must be doing something wrong.  I'm progressing this way: I got the first 4 watchstones by running maps in the 4 corner regions and socketed 1 watchstone each in 4 different regions.  In order to spawn the conquerors again for watchstones 5-8 I need to run maps in each of these regions with 1 watchstone but also of the correct tier.  But socketing a watchstone reveals new maps, of which I have none (since I don't think they can drop at all until revealed on the Atlas) and the existing maps get upgraded in tier.  So the only maps I have for that region are now of the wrong tier, meaning they can't spawn conqueror influence.  So then I buy 3-5 maps of the correct tier for that region, run them, spawn the conqueror and get the watchstone.  But if I socket the new watchstone in another region, it again makes all my maps for that region invalid because they now don't match the upgraded tier, so I again have to buy all maps I run in order to spawn influence again.

Is there any way to move smoothly through the Atlas questline and keep spawning conquerors without having to buy new maps every time I socket a new watchstone somewhere?",12,1585233520,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fpckyd/could_someone_help_me_understand_how_to_progress/,pathofexile,1

A few days ago I finished white maps - trading on [poemap.live](https://poemap.live) was extremely good. I often had much more pairings (and whispers) than I could handle. Or in other words, I traded missing maps faster than I could play them through in packs of 8-12 at a time.

Now that I've put in a few watchstones, I'm entering my higher level missing maps just as usual. I have about 50% of yellow maps covered so far - all of them by finding them myself. I think I have not had a single trade for yellow maps so far (multiple days).

I recently activated the ""ignore map tier"" option, but that didn't change anything.

Is there some effect going on that I'm missing? Obviously in yellow maps there are not that many choices, so the chance to get a pairing is slimmer. But ... none?

fpb7j0,Grimneco,[Discussion] Idea to Fix Unveiling: Decouple It From Items,"Just another idea to reduce loot bloat and easen the seasonal unveiling process. I suggest that the unveiling process is decoupled from items and instead made its own resource like sulphite. This would remove the cumbersome unveiling item management process and make the Mastermind encounter more valuable.

# Esoteric Knowledge
New limitless resource that can be used to unlock crafting recipes. Esoteric knowledge can be acquired in the following ways:

- Clearing Syndicate encounters. Each cleared encounter grants a small amount of Esoteric knowledge.
- Clearing Syndicate safehouses. Each cleared safehouse grants a medium amount of Esoteric knowledge.
- Defeating the Mastermind. Each cleared Mastermind grants a large amount of Esoteric knowledge.
- Using Scroll of the Djinn. New tradeable item that will drop in place of current Syndicate rewards from non-Syndicate events and chests. Amount of Esoteric knowledge depends on item level.

# Using Esoteric Knowledge
## Suggestion 1: Unlock Recipes From the Crafting Bench
By accessing the crafting bench player will be able to purchase the upgrades they wish by spending Esoteric knowledge. The crafting mods can still be tiered, with each tier costing more. 

## Suggestion 2: Records of the Djinn
A new interface would be implemented where player can unlock recipes from [a branching and expanding crafting tree](https://i.imgur.com/H7xrsal.jpg). In this concept the player is gated from the best crafting mods until he gets the prerequisite mods. I'm purposefully keeping the concept vague, as there are many ways this could be implemented. For example, the branches could be grouped by theme or equipment slot.

# Signature Mods
If Grinding Gear Games is keen on keeping the concept of signature mods, they could be gated by the following three methods (one or combination).

1. In addition to Esoteric knowledge, unlocking a signature mod requires some interaction with a Syndicate member. For example, you need to defeat certain Syndicate member X amount of times, you need to defeat certain Syndicate member while they are the leader of a safehouse, or you unlock it as part of their ""Bargain"" option when resolving an encounter. It can even be multiple requirements to unlock the best tier of a signature mod.

2. Introduce a second resource or an item (Fragment) that is solely acquired from the Mastermind encounter: Forbidden Knowledge. This would be consumed to unlock the most valuable crafting mods.

3. In addittion to any Esoteric knowledge value, Scroll of the Djinn has a chance to roll rare mod that unlocks a signature mod. This would make signature mods tradeable.

# New Currency: Veiled Exalted Orb
Unveiling items via Jun would still be possible via a new currency that adds a veiled mod to any item (similar to Aisling  research). The pool of unveiling options should be decoupled from the players recipe progress (to prevent abuse). This would require fine-tuning the new veiled mod pool. For example, should veiled mods include all tiers of a single mod and should signature mods be included in the pool.

---

# Pros:

- Less item management and vendoring.
- Lore friendly. Help Jun find the stolen records of her Order.
- No waste of old content.
- Sense of pride and accomplishment as player makes constant progress towards the crafting mods he needs.
- Knowledge rewards can be adjusted according to map, safehouse, and Mastermind tier.
- Encourages party play (Jun rotation).

# Cons:

- Crafting services might become less popular as any player can make progress towards the select crafting mods he needs.

fpaz4z,U_N_O,Looking for tanky build for computers that freeze/lag a lot,"Took a break last league and I'm coming back to poe now, but in delirium my computer performance is really bad and it freezes a lot. I just started playing this league a few days ago with an animate weapon build, which feels pretty strong damage-wise and got me to early maps with almost no investment. But whenever I do the delirium fog thing, my computer lags a bit be I die a lot. And according to the animated weapon build guides I've read, they just don't have a lot of defensive capabilities and often relies on flasks to regen life etc, which is pretty difficult to do for a laggy computer. So I'm planning to switch to something else early.

In previous leagues the tankiest build I've played was a strength stacking baron+soul tether zombie build which gives like 12k+ life/es combined, and a lot of leech through zombies. I also used the CWC+desecrate+spirit offering for a lot of shield regen even when my zombies aren't leeching. But I think spirit offering no longer grants es now? Anyway that is the kind tankiness I'm looking for, which can help me survive game freezes and maybe facetank some large hits etc. 

So any build this league that can do the same? I'm fine with most type of builds, attacks/spells/minions/totems whatever, just no channeling skills please (cyclone is fine).

I'm slowly making my way through the atlas.  Running t14+ maps to spawn my last 8 watchstones.  I say slowly because I rarely have enough maps for any given area.  I chisel, alch, and vaal all t14+ maps and make enough currency and enough maps to keep going so long as I bounce around.  Its alright.


Now I'm annoyed AF because I ran 5 straight maps (all 5 I had) for New Vastir without ever spawning influence and notice that the last pantheon guy I need is available over in Glennarch Carirns and I want my chaos dot res, so I go run that one map.  Drox spawned in the region.  Now I have Drox on Glennarch Cairns but I already have all my stones from there and I have to run 7 more maps for a stone I already have and of course I don't have more than a couple maps for the area.

fpamas,Draak0,Earthquake Jugg survival problem,"Hey guys!

So i was playing a 2-hander EQ Jugg, level 92 and was farming T16 maps. I dont do trading so my damage is not very high, so it doesnt feel good to kill T15+ bosses, but everything else defensively is kinda like in the top Jugg EQ forum thread on the PoE forum. 5k hp, 7 endurance charges, Unbreakable + Unrelenting ascendancy, 76 resists, 15k-ish armor, whatever. Im not saying that these are superb, but when it comes to spell damage or i guess chaos (?) as well, i feel like im a 1-2 shot. And i wouldnt mind if i wouldnt see otherwise in recent youtube vids. I mean, they blast throught all content without like taking any damage from anything, and when i check their gear, i dont see anything else defensively than what i have, not more hp, not more chaos res, not more all res, not more armor, etc. With all of the above in mind let me tell you, today i wanted to kill normal Atziri and when she spawned the clones i avoided all ground aoe spells and avoided hitting the reflect clone, yet somehow i died instantly. I went back, entered the arena, 0,1 seconds after moving i died instantly again. Went back again, started fighting the clones, avoiding, hitting, etc, boom, instant death again. I have played many seasons as SSF before and never ever had a problem with normal Atziri, even with much weaker characters.

After checking other's builds, forums, guides, i genuinely do not know what i am doing wrong, its embarrassing as hell. So here i am, asking for any tips you guys may have.

Because otherwise massiv lag spikes, freezes and stutter wont have a chance to kill you.

Lab would be to easy if you could dodge the traps, or telegraphed attacks from Izaro. But here comes in the sad garbage that is performance from this game. I mean they tried to kill us with black on black bullshit, now they do it with grey on grey and on death bullshit but hey, back to the roots. Why not try to kill all motivation to play the game with some really basic old stuff. Labyrinth traps are fun and fair if you have a fluid game. You see them, dodge them or outheal them. Same with Izaro, he can do a lot of damage with his slow attacks that normaly are easy to dodge. All this shit goes out of the window if you dodge and suddenly you are dead, 10 meters back where you shouldnt be standing anymore. Also nice is if you are in a safe spot and the game thinks ""hey how about you contemplate existence fore a few seconds while this traps rolls up to you?"".

Do we need to pay more that more developer can be hired? Do we need to buy more MTX so that servers can be upgraded to handle the code?

I just want to play the game and not get frustrated that a game that was made in 2013 runs worth on my pc (with all the performance hacks mentioned on reddit + all settings on low) than a game that came out in 2020 with everything on ultra high ...

fp9nhb,Neanditaler,This league really highlights the game's biggest flaws.,"Yes, obviously ""the biggest flaws"" is subjective. The point is not to bitch, but to communicate my confusion that GGG released a league that has a really fun and interesting concept overall, but also draws even bigger attention to areas many people keep complaining about.    

*1. Clearspeed and a timer that forces you to go fast*  
That one is obvious and even goes against Chris' own opinion. One thing I'd like to add is the work that obviously went into designing new attacks and monsters, as well as changes to existing monsters, that you never really get to notice while rushing through the map and trying to stay alive.  
*2. Clunky mechanics.*
Opening screenfilling menus in a map was horrible before with monsters suddenly attacking you even after you had cleared 2 screens around the encounter, now it's much worse due to more stuff spawning with a delay and an additional timer. Even the short animation Alva does before actually opening the portal annoys me now (additional time loss), while before I hardly noticed it.   
What's worse: The league mechanic actually forces me to play that way if I want to use it effectively.  
Also: the flood of items with little or no use falls into the same category. Decreasing the overall number of items while increasing the chance for something better/bundled drops of lower currency would already go a long way. Also, announcing 100 splinters and then tripling it. Seriously.  
*3. Trading*  
That's also a clunky mechanic, but a very important one. Yes GGG, I understood your reasoning on this, but there must be some better way.* Right now, there's a lot of situations where trading or even answering are just difficult/impossible/deadly. I don't like not answering to people, it's rude. Please stop stubbornly insisting on balancing item prices with an extremely annoying mechanic.  
*4. Bad map layouts and backtracking.*  
Bad layouts have been terrible before, this league they punish you even more.   

*Bonus point: Visibility*  
Enough has been said about this this league and I'm glad to see you're working on improvements. It would be great if that mindset was taken into the future and also to fix existing issues (e.g. Catarina, lab traps in the dark).  
  
Thank you for reading, stay healthy!

So, you need Level 5 to get the Exclusive Arcane Horns, and I accidentally found this out and it is currently working. I was unsure where to report this bug but this subreddit seemed like the place for it.

Linking your Twitter, Discord, Steam, and Twitch all give 5 ARP (10 with the Booster) but unlinking them removes only 5 ARP. So you can use this to get infinite ARP.

  
**Steps:**

1. Wait till Day 3 and activate your booster.
2. Link your Twitter, Discord, Steam, and Twitch. (+10 ARP for each)
3. Unlink your Twitter, Discord, Steam, and Twitch. (-5 for each)
4. Repeat.

....HOWEVER....to summon spiders you have to be the one actually doing the killing or at least getting the killing blows, not your minions. This means that all the kills done by your minions, be it zombies or spiders, wont resummon any spiders. To summon spiders you have to use the writhing jar that summons worms and try to kill those worms before your minons do it. You can kind of trick away your minons using desecrate and use orbs of storms or rain of fire to kill the worms, but its a headache to redo this at least once a minute.

Are there any one socket spells/skills/auras that does enough damage so you can use it to make sure you get a few killing blows every now and then?",8,1585216785,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp8wso/need_help_figuring_out_how_to_self_sustain/,pathofexile,1

fp7zkn,welpxD,What Build Diversity means (or used to mean) in PoE,"I posted this as a comment in a different thread, someone told me to make a separate post for it, so here it is.

I think most people who play PoE have a misconception about what ""build diversity"" is. They think if the sword guy using a sword and all items with little sword icons is viable, and the necromancer build with all gear with little skulls on it is viable, and you can also make an old wizard wearing robes and shooting lightning, that equals build diversity. 

If the sword guy can also use axes, and the wizard can also shoot fireballs, that's still not build diversity. If the necromancer can shoot fireballs and swings swords, THAT is build diversity.

Most PoE builds are basically the same. Skill + support gems that match the skill's tags + passive nodes that have those words + ascendancy that has those words + gear that has those words. This is what GGG's ""[archetype design](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2255049)"" means. And GGG removes the builds that don't fit that exact pattern, just like they did with Dark Pact spellzerker years ago, or non-poison Scourge Arrow just last league (SA used to be 30% of bow builds, now it is 3%, [and they are all poison](https://poe.ninja/challenge/builds?skill=Scourge-Arrow&amp;weapon=Bow)).  Another word for this would be ""illusion of choice"".  You can make a non-poison SA build... but you shouldn't.

PoE was not always like this.  I remember my 2-hand mace CoC Vortex ignite Pathfinder from Legacy League, that I made specifically to tackle max-sextanted T15 maps.  Or my Spell Acro poison Bladefall Berzerker that routed from Marauder start up through Templar through Witch to Shadow and down to Ranger.  Builds like this, on the whole, simply are not possible anymore.

Not only are they killing the ability to create niche builds on the design end, but they're also squeezing all builds to hit all the same categories on the balance end. Your build needs good clearspeed, good defense, and good damage. If it doesn't have all of those, then you can't play it. All builds must match the same basic outline.  This is why a lot of people complain about the Delirium timer, by the way.  And it's why GGG is probably not going to remove it.

At one point PoE was a ""do anything"" kind of game -- bow-wielding Templars! lightning-chucking Marauders! -- but GGG has decided that they don't want it to be that anymore. At this point they might as well remove the passive tree completely, because the endless scope that the passive tree symbolizes is not what PoE is about. If anything, it misleads people into thinking they have more agency than they really have.

It's a damn shame. You can't even play that ""do anything"" game anymore because of the live service nature of PoE.  I know not everyone likes that game, but it was the reason I started playing, and the reason I poured thousands of hours into it.",79,1585211518,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp7zkn/what_build_diversity_means_or_used_to_mean_in_poe/,pathofexile,1

fp70qn,WeePacifier,Explode on/after Death isn't a good mechanic.,"The truth is, Explode on or after Death is a horrible mechanic. It feels horrible to play with, and it's just a bad solution to a problem. Be warned, I'm gonna break rule 3 here.

Playing with explode on death generally just pisses you off when you die to it. Although in a good game, being frustrated from dying is not always a bad thing, however in this example it very much is. For example, when you die in Dark Souls or Sekiro, you can almost always just chalk it up to your lack of skill. Although you get frustrated from always dying in these heavily skill-based games, you know it's because you aren't the best player and make a lot of mistakes. Even in a classic example like Mario, if you die, it's because you weren't good enough to time your jump on that goomba just right. No problem, you'll do it better next time. In Path of Exile, if you die to Explode on/after death, it just pisses you off. How are you supposed to improve? Not kill monsters? Or maybe it was your fault for wanting to pick up one of the 50 simulacrum splinters that dropped on your map. In moments like these, it's very difficult for the player to blame themself. What was the mistake here? Deciding to stay in the same spot for more than half a second? Backtracking for loot? Furthermore, there is no counter to this mechanic. If you kill a pack of porcupines as melee, you are dead unless your build is insanely tanky. There is no item or skill that can counter explode on death. We should agree that after a monster is dead, it should not be able to kill you. How the fuck are these porcupines/delirium flying testicles more deadly while dead than alive? It strays from all common sense or logic. And you can't counter the damage at all if you decide to play a melee build that's squishy. You just die for killing monsters. There's no item or notable that can stop it. It's even hard to dodge, as juiced Delirium maps spawn so many monsters, and everything is black and white. How will you notice a group of testicles floating toward you who are also black and white, the same color as the fog that's hiding everything? As a matter of fact, I have some solutions right here:

Unique Jewel corrupted implicit or Watcher's eye mod: Death effects are nullified

Possible Notables/Modifiers: Monsters freeze for 2 seconds after reaching 0 hp, Monsters fucking stay dead after they die, Monsters deal #% less damage to you after they die, #% less damage taken from volatiles. Monsters with ""explode on death"" modifiers are highlighted in yellow.

The next major reason is that it's a horrible solution to slowing people down. Pretty much, to avoid the death explosion, you have to go even faster. This doesn't slow people down, it just encourages them to speed up. Furthermore, it's just a bad solution to the problem of speed-clearing. Imagine a family living in a house, and all of a sudden, their ceiling starts leaking and as a temporary solution, they put a bucket under the leak. So now, every time it rains, they just leave the bucket there to catch it. No, you fucking idiots, patch up your ceiling. Is no one going to address the elephant in the room? Many GGG employees themselves disagree with the explode on death mechanic and agree it should be removed. It works as a temporary solution to speed creep, but wouldn't you want a more proper solution like patching up the ceiling? I will give you the benefit of the doubt and say that the few GGG employees that spoke out may not reflect the whole company's viewpoint, but they sure as hell reflect a majority of the players' viewpoints. With the removal of explode on death mechanics being brought up by multiple GGG employees and nothing being done about it, it can only imply to me one of two things, or both. It makes me feel like you are lazy, because no one wants to put the bucket away and put the work in patching the ceiling. Or, it reflects incompetence because a whole board of game developers are unable to solve the simple problem of speed creep, and it's just easier to leave the bucket there. I'll give you a solution right now. To prevent speed clearing, just make the first delirium ring spread out slowly toward the end of the map so that if you go ahead, you are out of the delirium. It may not be a good solution, but it's better than leaving the bucket there. This solution will be hated, but if your true intention for keeping this in is slowing people down, there are a plethora of significantly better ways to do it.

TL;DR

Explode on death feels shitty to play with because it can't be countered in any way. Also a shitty solution to slow people down because it just makes you wanna go faster to nope the fuck out even faster.",32,1585206126,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp70qn/explode_onafter_death_isnt_a_good_mechanic/,pathofexile,1

fp6gne,cyantaco,Can you guys suggest a strong build for under 10ex? Any good cyclone or spellslinger builds you'd suggest?,"I'm looking for something that can go further than I can on my ED contagion. I have 10ex about rn and some gear I could sell to have like 15ex if I really wanted. Rn know my DPS is limited. I want to be able to do most activities besides maybe the very hardest. Simulacrum is something that I've wanted to do, but know I wouldn't be able to handle it right now. 


Clear speed is important, but I don't want to be lacking so much in boss fights like I am now. I was thinking a cyclone build as I heard they're cheap and OP this season (so I hear). But there are so many. ED is my first build so far since starting this league. So keep in mind that I won't know which directions to take the psssives, so I can't go off of just POB. 


I also thought spellslinger looked cool also, but a lot of guides don't list the cost, and it's hard to gauge the prices of a lot of rare gear without doing hours of research for each potential build. I figured it'd be easier to ask and see what you guys are enjoying this league. The friendlier the guide the better, and I also don't want to have to craft everything. Right now what's holding me back is this extremely expensive recipes. 


 I'm sorry for the really long post, and I know there are a ton of decent guides out there this league, but I don't know where to begin. It's hard telling which build variation is better without going off pure DPS.

Just imagine how frustrating getting a decent jewel would be if the notables pulled from the full pool. This could so easily have been the case.


It also surprised me that cluster jewels refund all of the passives when you unsocket them. I expected that I would have to refund them with respec points if I wanted to switch jewels around, but fortunately this was not the case.

After getting some experience under my belt, and learning a bit about what makes items desireable, I realized that in order to be profitable, I had to stop ROLLING OVER valuable rolls. Every time you roll over a valuable affix, you're basically throwing away money. 

If I had tunnel-vision and I was only looking for T1 ES/T1 Movespeed, I would miss the T1 ele resists, or T1 stats, or whatever. Selling that stuff helps to pay for the rest of what I want to craft.

I've accidentally rolled a bunch of T1 life gear this year. And I've made a bunch of money, because EB/MOM is alive and well despite the fact that I'm playing CI.

I just hope more people get into crafting because it's a lot of fun. What tips do you have for new crafters, or what questions do the new people have?",7,1585195434,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp4vtn/discussion_friendly_tips_for_players_that_want_to/,pathofexile,1

fp4sjb,HunnidsDood,Can something be done about these server issues? I live on the East Coast and can't even play on Washington DC realm.,"This has been a constant problem for the last 3 leagues for me and many other players to the point where we no longer play on Washington realm and the only times when we do is when Texas also shit's itself. I'm just sitting here in a simulacrum with the himilayan mountains as my ping. It is constant spike after spike and borderline unplayable at points when you have the sheer density of mobs like Delirium. I just don't understand why the server issues constantly go untouched and ignored by GGG for leagues. Then when ANY server issue is brought up, peoples internet is to be blamed and majority of the time it is not their problem. As I've been streaming and playing multiple other games with perfect ping all day and poe is the only game that causes massive amounts of lag. Like can we get some word on whether or not we're gonna see servers fixed? It's so fucking annoying having to play on Texas realm when I am a fucking East Coast player.",16,1585195047,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp4sjb/can_something_be_done_about_these_server_issues_i/,pathofexile,1

fp3wm4,TheNetbug,"Mainly playing SSF, saved up splinters and went in blind to do Simulacrum twice. Here's my thoughts.","To start this off, I'm by no means an expert PoE player but I killed pretty much every boss in the game so I wouldn't say I'm a terrible player either. I went into this with an ED build with roughly 50% atk and spell block, ES on kill and ES on block. My build can clear pretty much all content relatively safely. 

The Simulacrum is a whole different story however;

* Half of the difficulty is in getting a good arena or not. Act 7 town is extremely easy to get high rewards on waves but nigh impossible to kill a double Kosis + Omni spawn. Act 4 is the exact opposite, annoying as hell to get high rewards, but okish to kill the bosses (the small paths are extremely annoying though). 
* Regardless of GGG rebalancing the rewards, pretty much every single wave is a combination of talisman, armour, weapons, ""misc items"" siding with 1 good roll like fossils, incubators, scarabs, etc. 
* No GGG, it's not because a wave is a combination of exploding virus balls, porcupines or a stack of rare monsters with buffing auras that the simulacrum is hard. But for the love of god why is allies cannot die a thing in there, like, for real? Sidenote, I had a ninja rare with allies regen life in a corner near Kosis, good memes until I found out why I couldn't kill him. 
* I spawned a Kosis + Omni on wave 17 in act 4 town and that's where my run ended. I had no idea how to deal with an inc AoE, inc Crit, added damage as chaos and whatever the slowing thing is called buffed Kosis. Him exploding his balls in the small hallways was ridiculous at best. 

To finish this up, I've always wondered when GGG would add wave-based gameplay to the game which usually is amazing. But god damn do I wish they never did it this way so I could experience it in a proper way. This ended up sounding more like a rant than intended but I'm really dissapointed by how these runs went.

fp3n7a,artosispylon,trying to buy delirium orbs to enjoy the leagueendgame is the worst part about the league,"its insane how bad this experience is, i need a bunch of these orbs to play the leagues endgame (simulacrum is horrible and not worth doing even if you can full clear it)

&amp;#x200B;

trying to buy orbs i would want to get at least 2-3 orbs from the same guy to save some time even if these are often 5 chaos more expensive but even then 90% of them are afk, next step would be to go to the botters with 100+ but these guys charge 40 chaos for a orb worth 10 so i just cant bring myself to do that since there is no way i can make that back.

&amp;#x200B;

farming them myself would have been ok if there was a way to target farm them but as far as i know i cant do that and usually get 1 orb per 10-15 map despite full clearing maps.

&amp;#x200B;

A question came up when I was trying out a few Cluster Jewel notables: How do I know which notable will be where in the cluster before I buy a cluster jewel?

This can be important in some circumstances, for example when only wanting 2 specific notables and there is a third trash mod that you want inbetween the 2 jewel sockets. (so you don't have to path thorugh it to get to the jewel sockets and continue to medium cluster jewels)

To further explain my question imagine this cluster jewel here: [https://imgur.com/tOlRHjW](https://imgur.com/tOlRHjW)

Left notable: Martial prowess (suffix)

Right notable: Feed the Fury (prefix)

Top notable: Fuel the fight (prefix)

I tried coming up with some kind of pattern after trying out 10+ of these jewels, but neither chronological order nor prefix/suffix or order of text on the jewel did anything to give me a clue.

Can someone with more cluster jewel experience help me out?",6,1585185546,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp2hj2/how_do_i_know_which_notable_will_be_where_on_a/,pathofexile,1

Why not use a two handed 6L with +1 minion, +2 socketed, aspect of the avian, minion damage and all the bells and whistles? Wands seem to be a disadvantage.

Is it because you can run a shield too and that’s good for tankiness? Does it have something to do with EE or victorarios charity or arma brand?

If we have to backtrack to pick up items, we have to backtrack. That's fine. But what if the loot filter icons on the mini were always visible, regardless of whether you were in range of the item or not? (obviously until you pick the item up) This would be a nice QoL change to make backtracking significantly faster by knowing exactly where we need to go back to, while not trying to change the core Delirium gameplay loop that GGG intended.

This would prevent having to search the entire map making sure we didn't miss anything (please tell me I'm not the only one that does this) or remember where every item dropped.

fp0uaj,GreenTree28,"My Delirium Timer Rant: I Feel Like I Am ""Missing out"" by Not Playing Meta Builds","I think much of the fun in PoE for many players is trying out unique and/or self-generated build ideas. Since Legacy (when I started), at least once a league, I have tried out something janky and/or weak compared to what was popular. Over the course of those leagues, I never felt ""punished"" for doing so - I am completely fine taking a minute or two longer to clear a map or kill a particularly difficult beast, metamorph, etc. in return for playing something I think is fun. 

People have already expressed quite a bit of distaste towards Delerium's timer mechanic here, but for me, every time I run out of time due to map layout and/or failing to kill a mob, it's tough to convince myself not to reroll something like Ball Lightning Mines in order to fully experience league content, which shuts off completely if you are not fast enough, as opposed to simply taking up more time. 

I personally have never before felt more pressure to just play what everyone else is playing, as not doing so ""gatekeeps"" content as opposed to just taking longer to get to that content.",46,1585179417,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fp0uaj/my_delirium_timer_rant_i_feel_like_i_am_missing/,pathofexile,1

(Itai no wa Iya nano de Bōgyoryoku ni Kyokufuri Shitai to Omoimasu.)

The main concept is, that she's pretty damn tanky while using some weird skills she got ""due to reason"" to beat her foes. 

As base i decided to settle for scion/ascendant.

Her main attack Hydra i'm  trying to substitute with cobra lash, as secondary source of damage i'm using Herald of Agony (as equivalent for her Predator skill)

What i am are sure about is, that there's plenty room for optimizations regarding defense and offensive potential.

&amp;#x200B;

The build does not exactly have to be super fast or super efficient. being able to run every map tier is enough for me - after all, it's basically a joke character :)

&amp;#x200B;

So i'd actually love to get some feedback and ideas how to make her work better, because currently i'm quiet a bit behind in sturdiness and maybe a bit in damage

foyer7,cs_whistler,jewelled foil craft questions,"Hi guys

Been a while in the scene, but I just recently picked up crafting as a serious thing the last leagues. 

This time around i'm trying to craft a good jewelled Foil, hoping for a minimum of 400pdps. In this regard I went with the old school alt/regal and I usually tend to hit the flaring mod. As the weight is rather low and as i'm unsure of the chaos vs weight, would it be worth imprinting and hoping to roll and additional affix such as ATS, imprinting once more untill I hit a good affix on the magic -&gt; rare upgrade? The mod pool is pretty small afterall. I think the only relevant mods would be either crit chance or ATS. Would love some guidance in this regard.  


Additionally, the typical crafts leaves a prefix open (multimod nerf), which leaves me to the case what would be the best option to do with the last affix, once I finished with a flat phys, inc phys, ats, quality and crit? I could slam and hope for the hybrid phys, but the chances are little to nothing. Alternatively, a warlords slam offers ats/dmg hybrid or bleeding which of both would be relevant to me. naturally the ats/dmg is more beneficial.  


I really hope to get some guidance from all of you hardcore crafters. I still have a lot to learn.

Now, I may not have graduated from college yet, but I'm pretty sure that 4+2 is greater than 2+2+1, which means reward tiers are not the number of ""loot crates"" you get, but rather indicates the quality of the crate you open.

foy5dq,Lorefin,Can you recommend me cool and edgy HC build? (long story ),"Hi, I died and idk who to play X.X  
Its important its not marauder/templar/duelist  


My 1st idea was to make a gladiator (I went like OK lets play this ugly duelist)  
I was meant to hold a bloodseeker claw in offhand and yellow high dps in another one  
Play with double strike for fast attack speed and get instant heal, block + armour  
But I died to one of elderslayers and had really really bad DPS xD The DPS was horrible and had to sacrifice 2 slots for ancestral call and melee splash....  


2nd fun build I had was deadeye spectral shield throw  
This one I had a lot of hp and all the DMG with shield nodes, projectiles etc. I ended up having quite good armour and some evansion or iron reflexes i dont remember, clearing speed was really cool (deadeye's fast projectiles and tailwind) , free DPS u only needed high armour shield and DPS raised by a lot, easy lvling cool looks (ranger).. versus mobs it was cool, you didnt have to aim too much, just hit one mob and the chaining shield picked rest of the targets....  
But the trouble begins when I run into a boss...  Versus mobs I healed instantly with thief's torment, flying shield generated a lot of hits and i could refill my hp really fast but against boss I was just standing and going slowly ""hit hit hit""... just healing 30 hp from thief torent every hit XD i couldnt chase too much etc. as the boss would often jump to me... and he ripped me, these attacks were too slow to kill him ;\_;  


My 3rd build was very cool, I bought arakalii fang and ran necro with spiders, spiders had really good damage i had no other minions with HP only spiders and the DPS for me was great but well I ripped xD Kinda sad right now because sometimes I made a boss in 1s.... I turned out having around 5800-6k hp, MoM with ES as mana and 4200 armour....  but one mistake I ran too close to a mediocore boss and I died to phys dmg.... It could be a fun build if I hadnt make this mistake... But I spent a lot of money for dagger, devouring diadem.... Its not a build u just can just have on the league start.... Well I had duration build, I thought maybe I can have similar character on the league start, use srs and then swap for dagger and for check I had 4-linked SRS and well... it made no DMG xDD maybe I would have to play with minion instability and explosing SRS because regular ones just made no dmg at all xD

&amp;#x200B;

I tried some other things like: slayer leecher scion with normal spectral throw, at least u can have the same amount of hits vs the boss unlike the shield spectral throw but it was too rippy (I tried it on standard )  


NOw I saw a build that used Scion - she grabbed her HP and jewels and went to witch starter asc and went straight for the wand cluster... She used unique helmet to 6l kinetic blast on the helmet and on body she had power siphon with barrage support.... Her other ASC was slayer... So I thought nice, maybe she has good clearing with kinetic and then switches to barrage power siphon and leech against bosses... I turned out having no DPS at all.... damn idk how she had the DPS xD  


IDK who to play now or next league, maybe some explosive SRS or modify the spectral shield throw build to do better against bosses? :C I really dont want to play Jugg xD  


I was also thinking about smth based on HoA... I saw one necro with thief torment and life on hit and barrage... she propably healed herself fast with that and triggered HoA....  


Since minion damage increase your global dmg if you have that node, I thought about Toxic Rain necro archer, minion damage would increase my chaos dmg from Toxic Rain and would also boost HoA's minion...  


Or HoA Scion toxic rain archer? Like grab HP and go for Shadow starter point asc? Becuase normal shadow wouldnt have access to Scions HP",5,1585170019,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/foy5dq/can_you_recommend_me_cool_and_edgy_hc_build_long/,pathofexile,1

i wanted to try something new.. that's why I chose a EH-Deadeye build and got into the upper 80s. Mapping feels alright, but some bosses (e.g. the conquerer bosses) are actually a pain in the a\*\* -.- I can't even finish a single blighted map, because i don't deal enough damage and cannot kill the bosses. 

I'm using this build:  [https://www.poe-vault.com/guides/elemental-hit-deadeye-build-guide](https://www.poe-vault.com/guides/elemental-hit-deadeye-build-guide)

foxcyw,vahlic,Explode on kill from multiple sources.,"How does it work when you have multiple explode on kill sources.  Currently referencing the crusader influenced chest mod: ""Enemies you Kill Explode, dealing 3% of their life as physical damage"" The effect on Asenath's Gentle Touch: ""Enemies killed near corpses affected by your curses explode, dealing 3% of their life as physical damage,"" and finally Unspeakable Gifts: ""Enemies you kill have a 10% chance to explode, dealing a quarter of their maximum life as chaos damage.""  Do all 3 of these apply per kill, or does one override all of the rest?  I am most confused by the Asenath's Gentle Touch version as somehow there are corpses actually remaining with temporal chains still in tact, meaning the other two on kill explosions didnt remove the corpse.  Does Asenath's Gentle Touch somehow make a corpse remain as a bug?  Does the Unspeakable Gifts proc happen instead of the chest/glove versions when it does proc?

2.increase the difficulty and rewards the further in the fog/mist you go
3. Allow us to end the delirium when we feel it is getting too hard.  This end button should start a timer that counts down when the delirium will end. I say a 10 second timer sounds fair.

The whole point of the league was for us to let it interact with other league mechanics and bosses. Give us that power and remove the timer.

What are your guys thoughts on these? 

Make this league hard. Make it so the further away from the portal we go, the harder it gets, but also more rewarding. 

We can't make it the longer the delirium last, the more difficult it gets. This would be due to fast builds would be able clear them before they get difficult.

fovss0,UntilOppressionEnds,"Daily Delirium curbstomp thread, come share your woes. March 25","I'm now convinced that GGG legitimately thinks that clicking items on the ground is what makes the game fun for us and that they know what we want more than we do. They tried to pull it over on us last league before they made the organs automatically collected and now they just don't give a fuck. They could just vacuum the drops, or at least the splinters, and drop them at the end where there's already a vacuum like loot drop. What do they have against doing it anyway? This league is basically like the mine except they are super against a loot vacuum for some arcane reason. They act like they want to broaden the meta and then come out with the most restrictive league I think I've ever seen in terms of map pool and build viability. When asked about why they aren't making changes they always say some ambiguous bullshit about not changing the league like it doesn't go along with the spirit of an ARPG or something to that effect as if they are the gods who determine such objective standards. 

What makes this league especially bad though is that they have mechanics in the game to counter what they want us to do. As one example, they want us to stop and go back to pick up loot to risk losing out on the delirium rewards but have the volatiles that are the same color as everything else, unkillable, spawn in just like everything else, and are basically impossible to see through all the carnage on your screen one shot you to counter you going back to pick up loot. The alternative is that they really think people want to spend 50% of their time running back through an empty map having so much fun clicking the items on the ground.

fovjnk,HealthyCarrot,Worth to start playing as a new player? Also: some questions.,"Hi all,

I currently am looking for a new game to play after not being too happy with how The Division turned out.

There's a few questions I have, generally wonder though if it's worth for a new player to dive into the game or would I always ""lag behind"" since most of you have been playing for years?

I honestly don't even have any idea how/ what the endgame is, but given the age of the game, I wonder if it will be something like ""to run mission X you neex gear Y""...and then gear Y is some kind of super rare item you need to have grinded for months prior already.

That being said, how many ""low lvl"" activities are there? Every mmorpgish game I played so far I was greeted with basically empty low lvl missions/ quests to a point that you sometimes even barely could progress for the sole reason you were not finding people to play a group-activity with....because everyone was at the ""endgame"" already or people were running premade groups with twinks and didn't want to support actual low lvl/ undergeared players.

Other than that, some more questions would be:

* are there actual roles so you can play tanks or healers?

* are there clans/ guilds, generally, how group/ coop oriented is the game?

* how p2w is the game? I usually don't mind to spend a few bucks in f2p games for cosmetics and maybe bigger inventory space but tend to not bother with games that come with any clear p2w mechanics.

* does the game have a healthy population overall so you can find people to play with easily?

I'm sorry if such posts are not allowed here. I've seen the questions megathread but I never had luck with such threads since my actual questsions always seem to get burried and forgotten there.

Just a little post to say that now it's possible to have a warcry every second with this setup:

War Bringer : 100%  
Battle Cry + Warcry Cooldown Speed : 30%  
Second Wind (lvl 20 &amp; 20%) : 29%  
Mob Mentality (x4) &amp; Haunting Shout (x1) : 100%  
Dual wielding axe with ""axe\_basilisk"" mod : 50%

So it work every well with War Bringer, 25% Life and Mana every second is very huge and allow us to have a free flask slot (remove life flask). Moreover we can also have Endurance charges up with Enduring cry with a perma 500 life regen and/or a good amount of damage with Rallying Cry.",11,1585160294,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fov7nc/regenerate_25_of_your_life_and_mana_every_second/,pathofexile,1

fov4a7,Cactusonpizza,How do you counter high gpu temps in PoE?,"I'm trying to combat my gpu being fried by PoE. My setup consists of:

**CPU:** Ryzen 5 3600 running at stock speeds

**Mobo:** MSI B450M Pro 

**GPU**: Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2060 Super Windforce OC 8G

**Case**: Cooler Master NR400

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm running this RTX2060 card in a small form factor case which means everything is pretty close together. I also got 3 screens (1 34'' 1 27'' 1 24'') hooked up to my card.

Idle temps are around 40-45c (104-113f). I'm playing the 64-bit PoE version in windowed mode on Windows 10. Temps when in town are around 75c (167f), as soon as I go mapping though they go up to around 80-84c (176-183f). 

**What I've tried:**

\- Custom fan profile in Afterburner. It works ''okish'', I can keep the fan down but my temps will go up past 85c nearing 90c but at least it's silent..

\- Turned on Vsync in Nvidia Control Center

\- Playing full screen

\- Ingame settings:  https://imgur.com/undefined 

What more can I do to keep my temperatures down? Or should I consider my temperatures to be normal when looking at my setup? 

Maybe I shouldn't worry about it, if that's the case I'd love to hear it because right now I'm feeling like my temps are way too high..",8,1585159969,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fov4a7/how_do_you_counter_high_gpu_temps_in_poe/,pathofexile,1

I can get the conquerer taunted in a region, but if I run the correct tier map in that region (if it's T15 e.g. I match the tier) it doesn't consistently taunt the conqueror.

I need to run 9 maps to taunt, but I get a taunt like every 10 maps even though I have the 4 wacthstones in. 

I thought it was supposed to be more consistent.

In boredom, I tried running white maps in the region like last reason because these used to taunt them, but it seems that's no longer working.

Anyone else with the issue?

fotvds,YOUR_BOOBIES_PM_ME,"@GGG: Do not let the peak numbers during Delirium's launch confuse you. Those numbers were due to the success of Metamorph, and the new Atlas. If you want to see that level of excitement for the next league, you must fix Delirium.","The new Atlas is great. It will keep people playing a league longer than usual, as long as the other mechanics are fun. This is what happened with Metamorph. The combination was great, and many players were playing Metamorph right up until the end. This is why a record number were around for the Delirium launch.

The best part about Metamorph was that players got to clear maps the way you wanted, at a speed that was comfortable for them, and then choose their reward type at the end of the map. Brilliant.

Delirium is the exact opposite. Delirium requires that players make frustrating decisions for every single map. 

Do I skip killing mobs until I find the mirror? That requires me to backtrack after finding the portal, but it feels necessary to maximize rewards.

After activating the mirror do I skip looting in order to kill the most monsters possible, and then backtrack to pick up loot? Again, this is just a shit decision. It leaves you feeling like shit no matter which choice you make.

The core idea is great, but Delirium is not fun. Being forced to play a fast killing, fast moving build, just to participate in the league mechanic, is not fun. Being forced to run back and pick up loot on every map, just to participate in the league mechanic, is not fun. Delirium is not a success.

fotsti,Chnams,[QoL] Allow us to vendor 1 exalted orb for 20 shards so we don't have to go check out exalt values every time someone asks for X.5 ex or something.,"Title basically. Ex shards are super convenient for those pesky 4.1 ex, 3.7 ex, 0.9 ex (etc) trades, but they are pretty rare.  

It would be handy if we could vendor 1 ex to get a stack of 20 shards that wouldn't turn itself back into 1 ex instantly until you take 1 shard out of it and add it back (much like how splinters act).

Ideally, exalt shards shouldn't turn themselves into 1 ex in the stash (or currency tab) either unless you take 20 out, take 1 shard out of the stack and add it back to the stack. 
Exalt shards are rare enough that it really shouldn't add a lot of micromanagement to creating exalts from them when you loot them naturally, and it would help trade a fair bit.

However this leads to a surplus of master favour so I like to suggest having more ways to spend it. I think master should sell items related to their theme instead of just decorations. For examples  


**-Zana**: Still sells maps and chisels but instead of buying with orbs we buy them with favour instead.  
\-**Alva**: Items with Incursions mod,favour levels determined items level and at max level she can sell rare items or even League specific items instead (pre-sacrifice version).  
\-**Jun**: Selling veiled items and with higher levels she has a chance of selling specific Syndicate member veiled mod.  


\-**Einhar**: ~~Nets~~  Tallismans because he's an Ezomyte, higher level mean higher tallisman tier  


\-**Niko**: he is fine as of right now, no need to change him.  


\-**Helena**: selling all decorations which is categorized based on theme, master favour/level and process of questline",3,1585152582,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/foswuo/master_favour_rework_suggestion/,pathofexile,1

The forums seem a bit... messy with builds. There are only two I can see that really deal with the skill combo, and they're all so vastly different with trees and gems. I'd love to follow a clear guide here as I'm new to the style of play. Any thoughts? YouTube also only has like two.

Secondly, is storm brand really completely better than armageddon brand in every way? I only ask as I sometimes like to play off-meta things, but if that's like throwing damage down the toilet I'll give in and get on the bandwagon.

foqz5c,Gmorrk,"As a disabled player, I wish the controller would be made usable for the PC version of the game.","As a newly disabled player, I wish the controller would be made usable for the PC version of the game. At least in a separate SSF-League.

Just like many of you I have been playing PoE for almost ten years now. ARPGs since Diablo. Due to events in the last two years it has become impossible for me to use mouse and keyboard without pain for longer periods of time. Using a controller and sitting back in a chair is fine though. But my favourite ARPG has no controller suport.

Looking at the console version of the game makes me wondering - wishing - that it would be possible to use a controller for the PC version of the game. The controls and UI exist after all.

Now I know that two control schemes for the same league might spell trouble. Cross play betwen PC and Xbone would be big trouble. But some kind of ""Controller SSF League"" without the newest league mechanics or the option to migrate characters wouldn't upset any PC players?

I know this is asking a lot of GGG. Surely I am not the only player that would want to use a controller, but we are a very small minority. Still, I hope GGG might consider adding the option some time down the road.

How is it now? The fog goes forward and only stops when you do certain encounters, it doesnt seem to matter if you are wiping dozens of packs, if the fog is gone its gone.

Instead i would love it if the fog would expand further the more shit you kill, i did SO many maps where i could not get the 5th reward literally just because of the map layout!! If the map is circular so that at one point you have to go TOWARDS the mirror again, you can already just stop trying, while other maze-like maps like waterways are simply impossible with all the dead ends.

I really dont want it ending up with running the same 2-3 maps over and over just because they have a neat linear layout like burial chambers.

foq4eu,SisterHell,Easy 80 second Headhunter buff with 300% increased effect is possible this league,"[https://youtu.be/TaGFei8WXJI](https://youtu.be/TaGFei8WXJI)

&amp;#x200B;

Hello,

so this league with purposeful harbinger node, you can get 50% aura effect on you per notable with 5 hearlds.

Solstice Vigil's shaper's presence is also considered aura.

Currently, anything with some AoE tag gets amplified by the notable.

So, with 6 purposeful harbinger, you get 300% aura effect on you.

Which means, 20% slower \* 4 = 80% slower. It gets capped at 75%

so your 20 second headhunter buff becomes 80 seconds.

Furthermore, any HH buff with auras, such as speed, and damage aura, gets amplified by 4 times as well.

&amp;#x200B;

You just need solstice vigil, headhunter, and 6 purposeful harbinger for maximized HH buffs.

With patch coming this week, negative effects are no longer amplified so it's better.

So, this build makes ALL delirium content trivial. 100% T16 maps can be cleared within 2 minutes with this build.

This is the time Headhunter is **MOST BROKEN EVER**.  


So if you have Headhunter this league, enjoy your buffs",168,1585142288,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/foq4eu/easy_80_second_headhunter_buff_with_300_increased/,pathofexile,1

fopmvj,HoldMySoda,[Technical] Performance Post: Comparing Setups/Bottlenecks/GPU &amp; CPU Performance/Settings,"#Introduction

Hey there.

I wanted to wait for my new GPU before I made this post, and it arrived today, so here we go.

Before I upgraded my setup roughly 2 years ago, I was running the following:

* OS: **Win 7 Pro**

* Mainboard: **ASROCK 970 Extreme3 R2.0**

* RAM: **Kingston-something 4 GB** x4 = 16 GB, more I can't remember/find

* CPU: **AMD FX-6300, 6x 3.50GHz**

* GPU: **Sapphire Radeon R9 290 Tri-X OC, 4GB GDDR5**

* Storage: **1 TB HDD*

This setup was ok up until ~2018, though performance really wasn't good. Sometime later, I was only able to afford to upgrade my GPU.

I bought an **Nvidia GeForce GTX 970**. I was running that with the same setup until early last year, knowing full well that my HDD and CPU were bottlenecking hard. I couldn't afford more at the time.

Early last year, I upgraded some parts again, ending up with the following:

* OS: **Win 10 Pro**

* Mainboard: **ASRock B360M Pro4**

* RAM: **G.Skill Aegis DIMM Kit 16GB, DDR4-3000** (x2 for a total of 32 GB RAM)

* CPU: **Intel Core i5-9400F, 6x 2.90GHz**

* GPU: **Nvidia GeForce GTX 970**

* Storage: **120 GB SSD**

This setup was working fairly well, though my GPU was bottlenecking my CPU. I knew that. So, today my new GPU arrived: **Zotac GeForce GTX 1070 AMP Edition, 8GB GDDR5**

My framerate immedtiately went up a lot and overall performance is way better. More to that below.

---

#Comparing CPUs and GPUs

Let's get a bit more technical.

I used several sites to compare different setups and to see the relative performance of my parts.

Let's start things off by comparing my two CPUs:

**FX-6300** vs **i5-9400F**

According to [cpu.userbenchmark.com](https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i5-9400F-vs-AMD-FX-6300/4051vs1555), the **i5-9400F** has an overall performance increase of **+94%** over the **FX-6300**. When I bought this CPU, I was looking for a cheap alternative. And, my god, is it a powerhouse for that money. I remember the immediate performance increase after this little upgrade.

Now, let's compare my GPUs:

**Radeon R9 290** vs **GTX 970** vs **GTX 1070**

According to [gpu.userbenchmark.com](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-970-vs-AMD-R9-290/2577vs2171), the **GTX 970** has an overall performance increase of **+13%** over the **R9 290**. Nvidia just seems to work better in general for PoE, in my observation. It's also the popular opinion.

According to [gpu.userbenchmark.com](https://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GTX-970-vs-Nvidia-GTX-1070/2577vs3609), the **GTX 1070** has an overall performance increase of **+52%** over the **GTX 970**. Can confirm that this was immediately noticeable with over 200 FPS in hideout.

Finally, I also referred to [this website](https://pc-builds.com/calculator/) for bottlenecking.

According to said site, I can gather the following:

* Using the i5-9400F and the GTX 970, I get a bottleneck of: **11.95%**. Meaning the card was bottlenecking the CPU.

* Using the i5-9400F and the GTX 1070, I get a bottleneck of: **0.72%**. Meaning I have a much better equilibrium between CPU and GPU.

I play in 1080p because I haven't found a way for OBS to record in 4k for me. It's fine. I also play in Windowed Fullscreen because I Alt-Tab a lot. I left some sounds enabled because they are important, e.g. for Shaper slams.

#Summary

Hopefully this might help some of you folks identifying issues. Maybe you can find your bottlenecks and do something about them.

On a final note, I want to say that the 3.10.0.d patch (I think) broke something for me, with Conqueror mobs spawning in maps causing lots of stutter. It's slightly better with the new GPU, but it's still an issue.

foov9e,BendicantMias,Delirium Orbs need to drop a LOT more,"First off, I'll note that Delirium orbs aren't *that* rare i.e. it's not like you never see them, like we never saw Blighted maps in Blight league. The most expensive Delirium orb currently (Scarabs) is 35c. The cheapest ones (Talismans) are 3c. However, those lower tier ones need to be a **LOT** cheaper. And by a lot, I mean pennies err, alcs. Or even less. For 2 reasons -

1) You can stack upto 5 of them PER map. This means that those who do want them want a **LOT** of them. If your build can handle it (and mind that you don't need to rush if using an orb), then you ideally want 100% Delirium - per map, per player. In a sense, think of them as Cartographers Chisels, except we can stack one more of these than we can chisels. But the major reason is...

2) I think it's pretty widely agreed by now that the timer on the league mechanic sucks. At least, I haven't seen anyone praise that element of the leagues' design. And it doesn't look like GGG is gonna remove it. Of course, some people hate the rest of the league too, but there's likely enough people out there who'd like the challenge and/or extra density of Delirium maps so long as they aren't forced to rush. Well, Delirium orbs remove that issue. Sure the idea of throwing a Talisman orb onto a map sounds unappealing - the reward sucks - but that's not what you do it for. Basically, those lower tier Delirium orbs now have the responsibility of somewhat salvaging this league by allowing people to play it the way they want. Hate the timer? Throw on a cheap orb and enjoy the extra mobs to fight. But no one's gonna chew through them like candy  when even the cheapest orb is selling for 3 chaos.

So yeah, if GGG really wants to insist on the mirror functioning as a timed encounter, then at least give us another way to engage with the league mechanic - to play it how we'd like to. You've already got that way implemented - Delirium orbs. But you've got to massively up their drop rate (at least for the less popular ones) in order for us to not have second thoughts about using them.",4,1585136463,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/foov9e/delirium_orbs_need_to_drop_a_lot_more/,pathofexile,1

fooh8x,Zelniq,I think people are misunderstanding the point of this league,"I've seen people all over Reddit and top streamers like ziz say, in reaction to the paragraph on the on-death mechanics in the manfiesto that the whole point of punishing fast clear speed builds with that mechanic goes against what they assume is their goal, to slow down the game, since the fast builds deal with that mechanic better than slower builds. 

I don't think that's what their goal is with this specific league mechanic. I think they're trying to push players to go as fast as possible during the encounter, while still making things dangerous and challenging. Chris recently said in the AMA that they'll likely keep the timer because it's part of their core principles, they'll likely not budge on this. 

And the way the mechanic is designed seems to me to be intended that you're not supposed to be able to clear the entire map with delirium on, which makes sense to me as what other league mechanic affects the entire map.. all regular breach, incursion, abyss, synthesis, betrayal, blight, etc. encounters are all just a small part of the map and never affected the entire map, why would this work differently?",10,1585134458,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fooh8x/i_think_people_are_misunderstanding_the_point_of/,pathofexile,1

fomlsb,ttt_tyler_durden,PoE could have an amazing trade system based on hideouts and stash tabs.,"I can see the reluctance to add an auction house to PoE since, in general, AHs usually enable a type of arbitrage that tends to detriment normal players.  However, I find the current trade system a bit frustrating especially since I feel like PoE has all the building blocks for an amazing trade system just sitting there waiting to be leveraged.
I mainly have a single complaint about the current trade system.  I spend too much time trying to whisper people that don't respond.  I know some are arbitrage bots, but others are normal players.  I whispered one of the players doing it the other day and they explained their strategy to me.  They dump all the items the loot filter tells them to pick up into a 5c buyout tab.  Then they go back to playing.  If they get a ton of whispers for an item, they know it's valuable and worth spending the time needed to list it for real.  It's brilliant and that person gets to play the game while I stand around in my hideout whispering into an echo chamber.
So, what I'd like to have is some type of trade system, but not necessarily an auction house.  Putting vendors in hideouts is often suggested as an alternative, which I think is a great idea because the system could be built in a way that supports rate limiting.  For the sake of conversation, consider a trade system that works like this…
Add a trade themed master to act 1 that unlocks your first hideout.  The master would let you search for and appraise items.  This would be done by opening the official trade browser in-game, but with a slot where you can drop an item to automatically create a “filter by stats” search (to appraise an item).
When you find an item you want to buy, the in-game trade browser would have a button to create an orb of trade that would drop an orb specific to that item.  The orbs would have to be able to drop in your hideout and would contain all the info needed to make the rest of what I describe work (ie: item id, seller id, price, etc.).
Once you have an orb of trade, the trade master would offer a limited number of daily missions where you could provide the orb and the master would enchant it.  The enchanted orb would open a portal to the seller’s hideout.  The seller’s hideout would need to have a vendor at a well-known location and that vendor would sell the item for the listed price plus the orb of trade.  This allows for a transactional trade in a way that doesn’t cost the player one of their daily missions if they crash or if the seller change the price.  They can log back in and re-visit the hideout to purchase the item.  If an item is sold, or the seller changes the price before the purchase happens, the orb could be given back to the master to get the daily mission refunded.
The limited number of daily missions would allow rate limiting within the trade system, but in a way that’s thematically compatible with the game.  The number of trade missions allowed per day could be increased as you progress through the game.  The exact numbers could be adjusted as needed.
The master could also be used to interfere with bots.  The enchant could have a variable length cast time.  The master could teleport to a random spot after the enchant.  The master could spawn in a random location in your hideout every time you visit.  Etc..  I’m not really sure about the capabilities of bots TBH.
Selling via trade could also be unlocked by the trade master at some point, but only if gating or rate limiting sellers provides value against bots and scammers.  I can’t think of a scenario where a bot listing a ton of items that could be bought on demand for the listed price would be detrimental, but I bet someone will.
Regardless, each player should get at least one trade tab for free at some point.  Premium tabs and specialty tabs could be used to facilitate rate limit increases by granting you more daily trade missions.  Basically, anything that costs real world money could be used to increase rate limits since (I think) real money and payment info tends to reduce the number of spammers, scammers, and bots.
That would hopefully allow the rate limits to be adjusted in a way that bots using free accounts aren’t worthwhile, but real players wouldn’t be affected by the rate limits.  That’s assuming high level players that trade a lot have bought or will buy tabs.
The existing whisper-based system could be left in place without any rate limits.",6,1585123862,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fomlsb/poe_could_have_an_amazing_trade_system_based_on/,pathofexile,1

fomgtg,choquella,Animate Weapon is great! Here is how it can be better.,"I have extensively been playing Animate Weapon this league and very much enjoying it. To the point that I am willing to spend over 30ex min maxing my character and still continuing to do so. [Here](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/Choquella/characters) is my character in case anyone is interested. I have done a few big changes optimizing my build, and still have the goal to self craft every piece of gear I am wearing before I finish this character.  


As awesome as the buffs are awesome and well deserved, there are some very minor adjustments to this skill that could really help the quality of life of this skill even more to bring it up in tier of other minion skills. Enabling us to create weapons without picking them up constantly and reducing the mana cost so that builds no longer require weird setups such as Eldritch Battery, Spell Totem, Large unreserved mana pools has been a **huge** improvement to the skill, animate weapon remains a minion skill in it's own class so it still needs to be treated as such. I would consider this skill as a sort of hybrid between Summon Raging Spirit \[SRS\] and a permanent minion skill that is supposed to follow you throughout the content.  


The 2 main issues that still bother me after almost a week of playtime are that the weapons do not persist between zones. While this is a duration skill, (I am 100% against permanent weapons) during their long duration, I should be able to run content fluidly as I swap between zones such as leaving my map for a trade, entering a vaal side area, or loading a new delve encounter. The duration would still be ticking, but this allows me to portal out of a map to do business, and reenter ready to get back into the action.  


The other issue is that the weapons just aren't tanky enough. My build has level 31 animate weapons, permanent fortify from my Animate Guardian, Bone Barrier, 116% minion life, and plenty of regen. Their base life total feels punishing and losing all of my minions is extremely punishing for a build that has to ramp up so much to feel good. I even find myself playing like an SRS build at times that is constantly switching between bladefall and casting 3-5 weapons per pack to make sure I have minions out on particularly rough encounters. I have killed Sirus Awakener 8 a few times on this build, and losing my weapons to storms or getting 1 shot from small lasers causes me to have to portal out to ramp my weapons back up again. There was a cluster jewel added this league that gives minions invulnerability for 4 seconds upon being summoned and this makes sense for SRS which are designed to constantly be summoned, but I don't believe this is the main philosophy of Animate Weapon.  


Animate Weapon has felt better than ever this league (possibly overtuned on the damage side haha) and I am grateful that this skill has seen some good major changes. I am just asking that a bit more quality of life love be added to make this skill feel even more comparable to spectre/zombie builds that are still managing to dominate the meta with their ease of use and not having to ramp up every map.  


Exiles, Please let me know what you think. Do you like these proposed changes? Is Animate Weapon overpowered and needs to be nerfed back to it's previous state? Or, do you think that it could use some more love to make it comparable to the other meta minion skills currently available. I have played many minion builds since I first picked up PoE back in 2013 and this build has definitely made it to my top 5 builds that I've played.",8,1585123071,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fomgtg/animate_weapon_is_great_here_is_how_it_can_be/,pathofexile,1

foj56b,ijustmadeanaccountto,"Fossils and crafting. Why, just why?","So here I am once again another league same old process, my favorite part, trying to selfcraft slowly but surely piece by piece my gear.

After having crafted quite a bit in standard and in past leagues, I just don't understand, why.

Do you want us all to run around in fucking rares with 2 resists and 80 life?

Why the heck are there all those mods out there in influenced parts if you can't use them under considerable, half measured, botched efforts?

Do I need to have a stack of 5k alts to see tailwind once? Do I have to wait 1 month till i've gathered a decent chunk of veiled crafts or beg mathil for a craft every single league? Do I have to chaos spam -9 phys reduction nearby mode on my helmet? Cause I'm pretty sure jagged are incapable of that after 50 of them.

You killed multimod, you raised the ilvl of bases for most crafts to 85. You split the bases between the 4 influences and made fossils obsolete at the same time, without giving a decent alternative to obtaining the same sort of gear. If you didn't like how ""easy"" it was to craft said gear, you could simply mess with the rarity of the components, not blow the entire process to fucking smithereens, the market would reach an equilibrium making them less accessible with you at the helm finetuning how high or low.

 Every single step of the way rng gate after rng gate. I still didn't like the % of luck that was involved with fossil crafting but it was sort of deterministic to get an ok result, i'd gather up my currency and build what I needed in my build in a reasonable time frame with 5\~10ex for the hardest pieces. 5\~10ex is considerable effort especially first week of the league, but that was that, w/e.

If i wanted to gawk at unattainable gear, guess what, I could play a korean p2w mmo or better, visit real life. Burning ex after ex in fossils and bases to end up with absolutely nothing, is not exactly very enticing to keep playing.

Also the content is so fucking much and obfuscated as it is, that even if I achieved god tier mirror crafts that you so despise, it would still take me a month to complete the content anyway still playing like a maniac. Now I'm just chipping away at my patience. That's not fulfillment that's just feeling forced into tedious and possibly pointless farming.

TL;DR : If i wanted to gawk at unattainable gear, guess what, I could play a korean p2w mmo or better, visit real life. Bring back the crafting synergy. Stop murdering those very nice mods you created before they are even rolled in the game. They are meant to be played, not sitting in a stash tab for mirror service.

I got my char going pretty well (running 10-13 tier maps with delirium to lvl5 every time), but i don't know how to get my defenses up, even though i have 7.7k hp, i can't really survive against delirium bosses for example (i mean i kite and kill them, but i can get one-shottet easily), general maps and delirium itself are no problem, but i can't do simulacrum on late stages 17-20 (got lucky once, and had no bosses in late stages), especially if i don't have space to dodge all that sh\*t from bosses, and my sustain is pretty weak. 

Idk mb i should go armor/block somehow (mb use [glancing blows](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Glancing_Blows)), but i'll lose life then, and armor won't save me from ele hits/degen. I've never really cared about defenses before, because i didn't try to push my char anywhere, i just played a bit and dropped it, but this time i wanna really invest into my char, so that i can do t16 maps with delirium and stuff, i probably won't ever try again to do 100% delirius map, it's just a chore imo, especially bosses which take 10 mins to kill and drop like 12 splinters or smth.

I started playing at the end of Synthesis league with an HDD disk and the game would take way too long to load and would eventually crash on Betrayal encounters due to so much lag. For this, I \[b\]upgraded to an SDD just to play PoE\[/b\]. I was fine for a while and played accepting the eventual lags that come with every league. Last league I had to drop the graphics configuration to minimum and even remove the sound to try and amp up performance. Since the start of this league I have been dropping constantly to 0 fps and the load times are insane, so I thought today: ""Let me check the system requirements for this game, maybe I am off or something..."". This is the result:

[PoE Steam system requirements](https://preview.redd.it/yul1a1771qo41.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4a291e527457ee0ca2c459a1a621e49eb1f19c64)

My PC is no ""Streamer PC"", but I've played most games that have launched in the past year without any problem whatsoever. When I look at these system requirements all I can think of is: ""Great, I am above the recommended"", but that is not true is it? I was playing fine in legion (except for the massive lags that everyone was having at the end game with generals not rendering and such). So this is basically what I experienced:

\[b\]Synthesis league:\[/b\] Too much lag due to using an HDD. Bought an SDD and the game worked beautiful.

\[b\]Legion league:\[/b\]Game running smooth, but end game was trash for almost half the league, crashing and dropping fps really hard.

\[b\]Blight league:\[/b\] Legion encounters were almost impossible to do due to a lot of lag. Had to lower every graphic setting to minimum for Blighted maps and even so I would lag horribly and die sometimes. And I was not just the problem, console players couldn't even play blight if I remember correctly.

\[b\]Metamorph:\[/b\] The league was fine (except for horrible visibility of metamorphs), however the conquerers were also added and here we had a problem. Whenever the Crusader influence came up with all those hundres of mobs just popping in and spamming, my pc would almost explode. Should we talk about Drox influence? It was just horrible. Whenever I had influence, things would simply slow down and I would literally be scared to die because of lag.

\[b\]Delirium league:\[/b\] And now we are here... Delirium fog is simply waaaay too laggy and I haven't even tried it with conquerer influence yet! The game seems to be unstable with fps and performance in general (again...).

&amp;#x200B;

[This is basically the standard now.](https://preview.redd.it/8xr4r1ct4qo41.png?width=207&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db4eccc76e83a304811100f6a9d6e6e7836708bb)

This rant is not a: ""I'm gonna stop playing this shit""... It is more of a: ""get your shit together, because this is what makes new players avoid a game"". I already invited tons of friends to play this game and they just complain of lags and bugs. Eventually most of them just look for something else since these things just stresses someone out. We need to make a stand about this now or else I'm assuming Poe2 will just be this same mess. I just hope they learn soon that quality and performance is a lot superior to quantity of content. It is cool to get a league every 3 months, but was is the point is a ton of players just avoid it because of a laggy/buggy game? Why not be less ambitious with a league and focus a little on performance? I don't even know how consoles can handle this game...

Last but not least: TEST YOUR GAME ON THE MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SUGGESTED, I DARE YOU!

That is all, thanks for your time.

TL;DR: Performance is very poor even in some configurations above what is recommended for the game. FPS drops, increasing loading times, etc are making the game less appealing to new players and even old ones.",14,1585100928,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fohwmj/performance_rant/,pathofexile,1
fohvb6,Brenhawk9,Need Help Beefing Up My Defenses,"Hi, I'm currently in low red maps (11-12) and dying a lot. This was my first time ""making"" my own build, in the sense that I followed no build guide and just looked at what other people on poe-ninja did in order to come up with a general layout of the build. I'm dying a lot and I understand where the build could be better if I restarted it, but for now we're trying to work with what we got.

My current defensive layers:

Elusive

Soul tether (effectively makes my ES function like an extension of my life)

7.2 total ehp (the pob will say different, but I have a doryani timeless jewel next to Chaos Innoculation)

Vaal Molten Shell + Granite flask (about a 5.2k shield)

CWDT Immortal Call

A decent amount of leech (I know it's only .4, but in game it  actually is feeling like a lot atm)

&amp;#x200B;

Current problems I see:

Chaos resistance

Reliance on a mana flask which sometimes locks me out of accessing my leech

lack of armor (but I feel like with the links I need that it would be very hard to get that many blues on armor bases)

&amp;#x200B;

The Planned upgrades:

atziri's acuity vaal gauntlets, this will double my leech and is an insane upgrade for this build (currently out of the price range though)

Helmet, chest, and boots with similar stats as current but with chaos res

Jewel next to phase acro, to get it without getting acro

&amp;#x200B;

If I restarted the build, I feel like more evasion rating and armor would be the right call. But honestly I'm just trying to get the last 4 tiers of maps cleared and then I'm moving on to something else, so I want to fix this up just to get that done. I feel like with my current defense that that would take WAY longer than it needs to, and wanted to know what you guys thought I could do to beef up those defenses a bit.

I use Arcane cloak to add defense and damage to my arc and vaal arc.

&amp;#x200B;

While leveling and into maps my aura bot friend and I crashed around 40 times before lvl 70. I crash sometimes 2 to 3 times per map. The crash is just a full screen freeze then both my friend and I crash to desktop at the same time. I tried changing all my MTX and had my friend leave group and ran some by my self and I still crashed, He did not. Im not sure the reason behind the crash but i took out archmage and i didnt seem to crash anymore, but it took me 10x the amount of time to clear a map so it was harder to get a large sample. I will continue to run maps without archmage and report back if i crash again. Im also guessing it has nothing to do with my computer seeing as it was crashing my friend also.

I stopped using arcane cloak a bit ago and it stopped crashing. I recently put it back on to see if i would crash again and crashed 3 times in one map.

I am just linking this in reddit to get visibility of my bug report.

* Delirium Orbs

* The expanded boss abilities
* Cluster jewels

However, keeping all of this will be hard IF it's implemented as a ""10% of maps"" league mechanic and I'm not sure many won't want the Delirium mirror in every map. The best idea might be to heighten the drop rates of orbs of Delirium and make them drop from packs with Delirium-specific modifiers, maybe?

fogsqz,Darkblitz9,Suggestion: Make a trail on the minimap to show where we went during a Delirium encounter,"In case you might not know, Chris Wilson said specifically that timers would not be removed from Delirium as it's core to the mechanic. 

In this regard, asking for timers to be removed is not going to happen, and it's wasting time to suggest it. 

So instead here is my suggestion: Delirium Trails

When playing a standard Delirium encounter (without the orbs being applied to a map) you move along the map and kill enemies, moving to keep pace with the fog, and often forgoing loot for the sake of building more rewards. This leads to backtracking.

The largest issue with this backtracking is: knowing exactly where you went during the delirium. 

You could look at your map once the delirium ends to figure out where you traveled through it by seeing what parts are revealed, but this doesn't help you in the long run as traveling anywhere else on the map will reveal it the same exact way, making it confusing. 

Would it be possible to have areas on the minimap toned a different color to show areas that you traveled through while specifically in a delirium?

This would give players a clear path of where to look for their forlorn loot during backtracking, and would also perhaps give them an idea of just how far they managed to travel during it as well. 

**TL;DR** - Paint the minimap a different color based on areas traveled through during a delirium in order to make backtracking for loot easier for those who might want to run around after finishing but before backtracking.

fogho8,PiMaster123,The Sirus Fight Should Die,"A bit of a rant here, hoping it will make me feel better. I have failed Sirus twice already, my build is perfectly capable of doing him with enough dps and enough skill (albeit garbage) for me to actually kill him within 6 portals. However, both times I lost at least THREE portals due to some bull shit listed down below:

&amp;#x200B;

**Storms** ???? Last league, the storms somewhat made sense, there are storms that hover around a certain area most of the fight. However, this league, they don't even feel like they're moving. I feel like I'm one of the balloons in btd vs a well placed juggernaut. Moreover, I had storms near the bottom left/right side of the area. When I respawned, one of the storms somehow navigated to the entrance, how the fuck does this happen?

**On ground degens** Okay, I see them, props for that (for once), but how am I supposed to fight Sirus if they stay there for like a decade? Compounding this onto the already limited area is just... why...?

**Where the hell is he?** Everyone in metamorph said one thing about bossing was amazing, BEING ABLE TO SEE THEM ON YOUR MAP, is it really THAT hard to implement that? Yea I see my FOV changing but that doesn't give me any sense of direction until he snipes me from down town. -1 portal EZ

**Walls** Last league I was trapped INSIDE his walls during his hallway attack (how is it possible that I cannot use a blink skill to move away from the wall?). I didn't think much of it since I got many more chances to fight him (much easier to spawn, just a minor gripe with the spawning now). It happened again this league, except this time the meteor killed me (meaning I lost the fight).

&amp;#x200B;

Please GGG, I know you're able to make this shit better, if you want to make the fight harder, by all means do so.

fofuzl,PatnessNA,Optimizing for Blights [SC] [Necromancer] [3.10],"Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/SZX14GnY

Decided to take Animate Weapon for a spin, built the summon swarm around the idea of dual cold-iron points (because that's now a physical spell), and pushing the limits of the Carrion Golem passive buff as far as sanity takes them. I scaled back EHP by about 1500 hoping to ramp up the damage until I hit around 480% increased buff effect on a level 34 golem.

The damage is still lacking, IMO. I was hoping to roflstomp white Blighted maps.

But I also wonder if I'm just not accounting for blight mechanics effectively in the build - AOE damage, that sort of thing. Giant-ass bosses are usually what takes down the pump.

fofuap,Mechanoz,Feeding Frenzy interactions?,"So I've been testing some different Infernal Legion builds, and on a whim I decided to throw Feeding Frenzy on Summon Skeletons (something I never tried for whatever reason and despite it lowering my DPS quite a bit in PoB).  It wasn't as bad I thought, as the skeletons started using some kind of skill that lets them rapidly dash to targets.  I was under the impression that FF would only make their AI more aggressive so that they'd attack further out?  This dash skill ended up helping with clearing and even chasing teleporting bosses.  Without Feeding Frenzy, I haven't seen them use this skill and they just walk after targets.

Curious, I started testing Feeding Frenzy on other minions.  I haven't seen the same results.  SRS seems unaffected.  With Spectres it was kind of hard to tell.  I tested with Flame Sentinels and Slave Drivers, and didn't notice much difference.  I haven't tested zombies yet.

The wiki doesn't mention the ""skeleton dashing"" thing.  Are there more interactions like this?

fofj23,Frogsplosion,biggest aoe builds in path of exile?,"So I've been playing a double strike berserker this league, and though it's been fun, it's not really what I would normally be looking for in a build given that it's short range, incredibly squishy and just does not have the same satisfaction level of casting an enormous aoe nuke and erasing everything in the general area from existence.

I've tried kinetic bolt which went poorly given that there really wasn't a guide for it for obvious reasons, but i've never actually made a successful big aoe build. I've seen a few things that look interesting, kripparrion was playing some kind of trap or mine build last league that was screenwiping literally everything with massive fire explosions which seems cool. I'm also curious about bane pop, I've seen a couple videos referencing it but none of them have actually adequately explained what exactly it even is besides showing me a giant aoe burst of some kind.

I'm still more or less experimenting with stuff as I think most of my successes are just a result of copycatting, I haven't really come up with anything on my own that's worked with any degree of success. I played necro last league with summon raging spirits which was pretty cool, I was wondering if skeleton mages are still viable, might not exactly be big aoe but sort of fulfills the same aesthetic need seeing a billion skeletons shooting balls of fire and ice at things.

So yeah I'm kind of drifting in the wind here, not enjoying delirium quite as much as metamorph so I'm both thinking of trying something new now to possibly use next league, and looking for cool builds I don't know anything about that are big, flashy and screenwipe super easily. I don't necessarily need it to do bosses super well, plowing through maps and delve content is fun enough for me at the moment and I haven't really gotten the minmaxing down for it, my gear is always pretty shit compared to whatever build I'm ape-ing because it all seems to be so goddamned expensive, I rarely get more than an ex or two to my name each league.

I like the idea of dual wielding either of these weapons, but I can't seem to find a build / skill that would work well with then. I even tried to peak at poe ninja builds, but a total of 0 players use Avarice, and only a handful use Dyadus, but I couldn't make any sense of their builds.

I rolled OoS/Storm Call Assassin for my league start. I have no complaints about the build in general. Leveling was quick, damage is there, clear is bonkers, single target surprisingly good if you spam SC inside OoS, shits on delirium, and it’s fast. Problem is I haven’t focused on any defensive layers for the build so if i’m getting hit hard it’s generally a death. I’m level 85 now and working on clearing my atlas, i’ve almost finished white maps. I am dying about once every 5-6 maps and it’s generally unpleasant. Sometimes it’s obviously my fault but if i could cut down on deaths I would be very happy. My question is there a way that i can maybe squeeze in a defensive layer? I was thinking of getting ele weakness gloves to open up some sockets for maybe a steelskin or IC link but that will be pricey and the rest of my gear isn’t great anyway. I could drop some nodes and path for life or ES but I’m unsure of the best nodes to drop and big life is kind of far away. I’m not a very experienced player and this is the first time I rolled assassin. The other leagues I played I rolled max block glad so I was beefy but comparatively slow. I really enjoy the speed and spammy nature of this build but I’m not sure I want to take it to the next level and drop a lot of currency if I can’t cut back on dying.

-Extreme amounts of unneeded clicking (try doing a Perandus orb on your map and click 20 stacks of coins instead of 1)

-Back tracking due to being unable to loot items (multiple stacks of same item, pickup distance being tiny). If there was a vacuum for only splinters during Delirium I think the league mechanic itself would be fine.

Fortify should support Animate Guardian's Weapon, from a gameplay point of view, since it supports Animate weapon and every other melee minion.

The reason why I think it doesn't is because the skill is ""triggered"", and with that tagged as such and Fortify doesn't support triggered skills.

&amp;#x200B;

If this is the case, it's obviously a ""bug"" in big quotations, since fortify is supposed to support the weapon's attack and not the summoning/trigger of the skill. But since support gems are passed down through the skill, into the minion's skills, the ""triggered"" tag on the skill prevents any interaction, and with that, prevents fortify support from reaching the minion's attack skill.",2,1585083446,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fod14u/fortify_support_does_not_support_animate/,pathofexile,1
fod0po,CheifBigNug,Another suggestion for people struggling with performance issues and what finally did it for me,"Hey guys just wanted to give a suggestion to people who may still be struggling with performance this league that I haven't seen and what I finally did today that seemed to have helped. 

I simply cleaned my computer and though it may sound stupid I kid you not it has completely helped with my performance issues.  I went from struggling with FPS in maps going from 50 to 15 constantly to just getting done running some maps and averaging about 100 FPS with little drops.

So while it might sound a little gimmicky, if you have the time which many people do right now I suggest just trying to clean you case fans, CPU coolers and get that inside all cleaned out of dust.  All my temps are down its running quieter and I can finally play POE again.  Hope this can maybe help someone out there.

focxk8,Got_Bored_Enough,A bold request for GGG,"Add different game modes that are balanced differently to poe. Poe2 is the perfect time to do it.

We currently have 2.5 game modes in the game all being treated as one game mode. 

Hc complains when their control gets taken away because they only get to die once. Taking control away is an easy way to add difficulty to SC. The only reason the logout macro exists is because the game has aspects that were clearly not balanced with hc in mind.

Sc complains about the game being boring and easy when it is balanced for a fair HC experience because it's slower and more methodical.

When ssf is doing well trade crumbles. When trade is doing well ssf crumbles. 

We have a large gradient of players for this game looking for something different. Some enjoy the zoomy gameplay with timers being the challenge, some treat it like their worst enemy as they want slower more methodical gameplay. Some are casuals that don't want to restart all over again and some are try hards that want to make the stakes as high as possible. 

The players will argue constantly over what troubles afflict the game and the ways to alleviate those problems. I assume it's the same for the devs to a much lesser extent. So why focus on one thing trying to appeal to everyone when you can make several smaller parts that will appeal to the individual groups more? I know to a lesser extent this has already been done with the expansions to the core game.

My bold request is to choose a different focus for poe and poe2 and don't compromise between the two of them. If a change needs to be done to one, it should be isolated and changed based on the goal that the devs set for that campaign rather than trying to appeal to everyone with the difference being the setting and nothing else. 

My last request is if you do decide to do this: don't make the post game cross play. Giving a cross play option along side it is fine. Making it a coop focussed cross play option along side is even better imo, but making the post game cross play makes for the same kind of compromises we currently make without any room to experiment without stepping on the toes of a good chunk of players. It also saves a good bit of rebalancing as the new ascendancies wouldn't need to compete with the old ones. 

I'm curious to hear the other members of the subreddit as well as the devs thoughts on these requests.",9,1585083136,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/focxk8/a_bold_request_for_ggg/,pathofexile,1

[Bug Report](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2805950).  Essentially EB should add unreserved ES to unreserved mana to calculate archmage's benefits,  per Mark's statements on the [gem release post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fh78tk/path_of_exile_delirium_gem_information/fk9ceh4/):
&gt; if you have EB it will compare the mana cost to max ES plus max unreserved mana

Instead, it does nothing.

I have 6106 mana currently and 1990 ES, none of which is reserved.  Allocating EB should make my pool for archmage calculation be 6106 + 1990 = 8096, which is about 25% more than 6106.  Due to archmage support this should both increase the mana cost of the skill substantially and its damage, instead neither of which are happening.  

I thought maybe it was because of this line:
&gt; Supported Skills gain Added Lightning Damage equal to (70-127)% of Mana Cost, if Mana Cost is not higher than the maximum you could spend

and there being some interaction where even though it should consider ES+Mana, but if the ES alone couldn't support the mana cost it would fail.  That's not it because even removing other links so that the cost would fall way under my ES amount it still has 0 effect.

TL;DR EB doesn't do anything with Archmage support atm, missing out on substantial benefit",4,1585077189,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fob3uc/archmage_eb_interaction_doesnt_seem_to_be_working/,pathofexile,1

c'mon, this one is a bit too much.

you gave us Delirium Orbs that remove the timer, as an uncommon reward from the base Delirium mechanic.

REWARD. how often do you reward your players by ""removing the entire point"" of your gameplay mode?

scratch that, how often do you implement something that ""removes the entire point"" of the gameplay mode it comes from?

scratch THAT, how often do the clutter-league-bloat-currency-that-exists-to-drive-stash-tab-sales ""remove the entire point"" of the league? if they were pointless people wouldn't even want to pick them up.

it's very obvious that the timer is there to create artificial difficulty, and the orbs to give us a way to experience Delirium as it was meant to be.

fo8ks5,Soma5356,I don't like the new Atlas.,"It's going to be difficult for me to say this without sounding whiny, but I will do my best. I absolutely HATE the new Atlas/Watchstone system. I've played PoE for 3300 hours, and it's never really felt grindy at all to me (until 3.9).  Needing to finish a map, then finish it as a red map, then finish it again after it's Awakened is awful. I'm not expecting to finish my Atlas in a day, but I DO expect to finish it (I'm only on 21/36 Watchstones) after a few weeks, playing 8+ hours a day . I've been trying my best to push my Atlas as fast as I can. It'd be a lot easier if trade wasn't in the worst state it's ever been, where you have to message 37 people to buy a single map, or 32 people to buy jewellers, etc.   


Please do understand that this is only my personal opinion on the state of the Atlas, and I still very much enjoy creating and playing builds in PoE very much, and it's my favorite game of all time, this isn't meant to be an only negative complaint, but it's something that has been bothering me this entire league as the only thing I've been doing is slogging through maps to try to make it all the way up to a full Atlas.",7,1585069204,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo8ks5/i_dont_like_the_new_atlas/,pathofexile,1

This is a AutoHotKey script that helps you quickly find maps with a single click on the button of the desired region.

This is my relatively pretty modification of the original script that [/u/FallMakesHideouts](https://www.reddit.com/u/FallMakesHideouts/) posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fbdeqj/poe_region_searcher_overlay_110_sort_your_maps_by/).

This version uses compact icons, transparency background, the ability to move the entire interface whatever you want, change or remove at all the title, ability to change transparence.

Also completely removed the original functions of tracking influences and watchstones.

**Features from the original script are still there:**

* Click on the icon with region name to search your maps by region. Works in any stash tab with a search bar. (Make sure your stash is open when you do this or nothing will happen) .
* Show/Hide overlay by pressing F2
* Move the icons wherever you want and save position for next time you open/reload the macro. Show and hide interface by pressing F2 once to save the current position.

**But it have some other changes:**

* ""Always on top"" now work only in Path of Exile window.
* Fully transparent background.
* Options for change Title and transparence.
* Correct work in Windows systems with *any keyboard layouts*.

... and ofc you can customize the hotkey, title and transparency in Settings.ini 

&amp;#x200B;

**How To Use:**

\* Install AHK [https://www.autohotkey.com/](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

\* Put all files in your prefered path.

\* Open Region Selector 1.2.6.ahk

**Credits:**

\* \_AHK-just-me\_ for [Class\_ImageButton](https://github.com/AHK-just-me/Class_ImageButton/)

\* \_Fall\_ for original script [PoE Region Searcher Overlay 1.1.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fbdeqj/poe_region_searcher_overlay_110_sort_your_maps_by/) and images

**It will be great to add the following options:**

* Track of conqueror influences in region by changing color tones of icons.
* Track number of stones affecting the region/received in the region (needs to think about the right solution).

Probably something like this 

[Variants](https://preview.redd.it/2yyjkq8qfmo41.png?width=228&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10ea981c83fff9de8ce25b7d073a5aab9319c896)

Only this is not possible, since I completely do not know how to implement it.

**Known problems:**

* When the keyboard layout other than English is enabled in the Windows, pressing buttons to search regions can enter letters in different registers. Usually this is not problem and search still works.
* AHK code not fully cleared in some strings.I could not completely remove the code from the original release because the options of writing and reading the window position in the Options.ini always lost. So far it has not been possible for me to fix it.
* AHK cannot fully correct show transparent PNG-16 images. That's why cross in move icon at the right from buttons not enough smoothest.

fo6hj8,BigBadSuzie,I LOVE the Delirium concept! It's brilliant. But...,"tl;dr

Switching Delirium end trigger from time-based to action-based could make the mechanic more enjoyable and open it up to more types of builds and player styles.

-----

I really like that by stepping through the mirror, you juice everything in the area; loot, monsters, boss fights, all with one action.  That concept is brilliant.

But you also have to switch Delirium off, and the devs chose to do that with a timed event, using a limited amount of fog sliding out of the area.

Imagine if the devs had instead used a player action.  For example...

You step through the mirror, the fog spreads all through the area, but the fog doesn't move.  A golden path starts from your char and snakes across the area; this is the path to the exit point.

You can go anywhere you want in the area, poke any pods, fight any monsters, even the boss.  Take as long as you want.  Pick up all the loot drops at your own pace.  As you kill the mobs, your Delirium loot icons progress, just as they do now.

When you're done, follow the golden path to escape the Delirium (see how that works?).  At the end of the path, walk through a second mirror to return the area to normal; that is when your Delirium loot drops.

This change lets any build or player have a real shot at finishing a Delirium area.  Wanna zoom?  Go ahead, speed clear all you want.  You will clear way more maps than I will in an hour, cause I'm no zoomer.  But we will both run the area at the pace we enjoy.

But wait, there's more!

(Optional)  Once you kill enough mobs (say the Delirium count reaches 9 or so), another icon appears at the bottom of your display.  When you click this icon, a large, white pod with a monster trapped inside appears near you.  This is the area's Delirium boss.  Hover on that pod to see the boss' attributes (life regen, uses fire, drops gems, etc).  If you like what you see, click the pod three times to unleash the boss and start the fight.  Loot from this fight drops in the area (and you might get a buff in your Delirium loot??).  Like the MM fight, you control when and where the boss spawns, so you can take advantage of local terrain.

A large number of recent rants have focused on removing the countdown timer, but the countdown timer is not the problem and removing it alone won't fix Delirium.  But I think switching the end trigger to a player action could make a huge difference.",4,1585061960,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo6hj8/i_love_the_delirium_concept_its_brilliant_but/,pathofexile,1

fo62a4,007sparta,Game stability: To Chris from the HC playerbase,"Unsurprisingly to the entire player base, the game is in its least stable iteration since launch 7 years ago. Server lag, instance lag, crashes to desktop, this league has demonstrated how much of a mess PoE has unfortunately become. Understandably, much server lag can be attributed to a heightened use of internet infrastructure with the global pandemic, but this cannot explain away the incessant crashing to desktop and FPS/CPU implosion issues players have been noticing.

This is particularly damaging for players who only play HC/SSFHC. Problematically, losing a character to a bug like this, for many players, will push us away from the game faster than anything imaginable. Seeing your game crash to desktop, only to relog  to find that your character was killed while the game wasn't even open usually results in one quitting the league. As GGG is focused on player retention, perhaps you should reconsider your stance on deciding not to implement and adjustable DC timer.

An adjustable DC timer, as has already been discussed several times over the years, would allow players to modify an .ini file to change the default 6000ms server-based disconnection threshold. The server would, on initial login, check this value and adjust that player's timeout disconnection threshold.

I argue that GGG's stance that it would ""frustrate"" players who set the threshold too low, overestimating the stability of their own connection, is completely groundless. Excuse me from being so vehement about this, but GGG's only argument supporting their refusal to implement this is, IMHO, a position that is not only incomprehensible, but an affront to their players' intelligence. Obfuscating the procedure by not implementing it in the game's UI would prevent those who have no idea what they are truly doing from destroying their own game experience. Clearly, anyone who messes in this file and finds the game unplayable will revert their change. To think otherwise is to consider your players to be utterly clueless human beings; an objectively false statement as they are attempting to play PoE, not Diablo Immortal.

The truth is, omitting this essential tool, especially given the current instability (client and server-side) is immensely damaging player retention, particularly in HC leagues. What is the sense of playing at all if I know that my character is 95% likely to be killed by a crash/DC, and only 5% likely to be killed through a fault of my own? Understandably, and with content gated behind dozens of hours of game play, I am much more likely to crash and die before reaching my end-game goals, than I am to reach them at all. In this context, it is understandable why anyone would go play something else.

This is not a rant post, it is a suggestion for GGG to reconsider their ideas to improve player retention. In the meantime, I will see you next league.

I'm not super versed on the end game Delirium mechanics yet, haven't ran a delirium map as i'm still working to unlock my first Sirus fight, but are the weird scarab prices due to how the various rewards/mechanics interact with the delirium orb maps?  I see div scarabs are king right now by a significant margin..


While we're talking about economy... i'm also surprised catalysts and metamorph scarabs are so cheap this league.  Is that guaranteed catalyst reward enough to completely offset no longer having metamorph encounter in every map?  Did crafting changes make catalysts less valuable?

fo547h,Jkysler,GGG needs competition more than ever.,"This league’s release has had mixed receiving, seemingly more on the bad side. I personally will not touch the league. It also seems that there are two constant circle jerks of either shitting on this league or praising this league. One thing is for certain: remove. The. Damn. Timer. 

What brazenly opens this league as the worst though is the massive performance issues that a lot of the player base has had. I've personally had performance issues since the introduction of Betrayal ninja-behind-you portals from the assassins. Which still is a problem for many, mind. 

Only, this league has stood out to amplify this problem 5 fold. Constant reports of performance issues seem to fall on deaf ears and even so far as to distastefully being told to lower our graphics settings. (Like most people don't already.)

After being bought out by Tencent, one would think that GGG would regroup and work on old outdated content or fix their present problems, but no. They insist on bloating the game with content. Adding league after to league to base game. 

GGG's complacency with their now cookie-cutter formula is getting stale and a lot of people have voiced their distaste with how tone-deaf they seem to be. GGG needs competition so that they'll actually start listening. 

They've become too comfortable being on top of the current ARPG market. Using outdated ways of game mechanics is just not wanted anymore. I sincerely hope that Wolcen can pick up its feet, or that Diablo 4 will make GGG realize that they can't abuse their playerbase with 2012 mechanics anymore.

I start Delirium with Arc saboteur and it seems to be a bad idea. Not tanky enough, not has high DPS to kill the endgame boss in the 20/20 waves even using Ball Lightning. I want to reroll. I search youtube with keyword ""Simulacrum"" and with the time ""last week"" and I find a few build but they are all expensive, e.g. Storm Brand - ArchMage hierophant, Mana guardian Icestorm, Bleed Bow Gladiator, Imaple Cyclone Champion...etc, all of them have high-end, expensive gears.  


I am not good at making exalts so I look for  
1. budget build(less than 300 chaos)  
2. tanky(maybe only shaper, sirus and delirium monsters can oneshot)  
3. good enough DPS.

fo2zzr,Nimyron,How to rush a Marauder to Act 5?,"Basically title, what gems, what strat, what gear?
From my research I found this :

- Dual wielding hatchet for a balanced attack speed/damage
- Taking blood magic + mortal conviction and vitality to get rid of mana problems (which can be managed with mana flask until then
- Using ground slam, then sunder, then tectonic slam

I've also added to use double strike for single target because the three aforementioned skills are not good at that in early levels.

Problem is, it feels super slow, you can rarely one shot enemies (although with other skills like arc, you can, even without supports) and I'm not talking about MS since I have +10% MS on boots and the basic quicksilver flask.
And bosses are even worse, double strike works during act 1, gets a bit harder at act 2, but I seriously struggled to kill the vaal oversoul (I mean I was 2 levels below but still)

Currently I have sunder+onslaught+melee phys dmg and double strike+chance to bleed+ruthless

I'm also using holy flame totem for a bit more damage and some sustain.

So do you have any tips as to how to do a better rush to act 5 with a marauder? Maybe better gems or some uniques that could be used?",9,1585046293,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo2zzr/how_to_rush_a_marauder_to_act_5/,pathofexile,1

&amp;#x200B;

* In my experience so far it's difficult to justify taking more than one outer socket, or even one sometimes, took hours in tinkering in PoB to barely eek out a tiny numerical advantage with GG jewels I don't have. In the end I took one for utility I can't get anywhere else and accepted damage drop. Wish I could afford to take another one. My preferred change would be if the outer sockets would not have two preceding minor travel nodes to lower the massive opportunity cost, it already demands traveling near the outer sockets and then wasting extra 2 skill points on top of that is too much.

&amp;#x200B;

* Most of dropped large cluster jewels are useless, do they really have to roll up to 12 skills where in reality only the 8-pt one are useful? Perhaps they could roll 8-10 skills instead, or have weighting to prefer 8 point ones. As it is you basically have to get them from trade.
* Wet dream but rather than using poedb would be nice to be able to somehow view in game what sort of notables can roll on what jewel.

The ultimate victory was to discover a build so over the top that GGG had to specifically nerf it the very next patch.

The game has bugs, it always did. There was the unspoken contract that a f2p game like this could only push 4 massive releases a year if players were willing to accept less than perfection, and that GGG would work tirelessly to fix things as fast as they can. 

I'd argue that GGG hasn't changed but the player base has.

fo1izh,obaobab,Lags in 3.10? Fix! (unordinary method),"Hi everyone!

Here is my unordinary method to fix lags in Path of Exile 3.10. This method helps me play RDR2 on my PC without ANY lags and it works on PoE 3.10 Delirium as well!   


Works like magic, but i have explanation why it works below. So here we go.  


**How to fix lags in PoE 3.10?**

&amp;#x200B;

* Download tool BES 1.7.7 ([official site](http://mion.faireal.net/BES/))
* Open Path of Exile
* Open **BES** and press **Target**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qye89cnvvko41.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d67f06c3d9488fca10d509865496f8409c58c14

&amp;#x200B;

* Find file **PathOfExile\_x64.exe** (or steam version of exe-file), pick it, choose **2%** at the bottom and press **Limit this**

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img nv6m9w1wvko41...*

* Finally, answer **Yes** in popup window

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img gn70q0o5yko41...*

**That's it! Enjoy your lag free PoE.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Ok, why it works?** When you chose ""2%"" in this tool, you are basically limit CPU usage of .exe-file you chose. After enabling limit, picked .exe file **CAN NOT use more that 98% of your CPU.**

**And that's the point.** Your PC do not lag anymore cause PoE using 100% of your CPU while intense fight especially in delirium zones.

**Here is an example**. That's how graphic of CPU usage looks *without BES* while i'm playing PoE:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 1jb1wsg5wko41...*

But when i limit PoE with BES graphic looks like this:

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ax47nsfcwko41...*

So basically your PC not freezing while you playing and that's why you get lag free PoE. Like i said, it works for me in RDR2 on this CPU. I played at almost high graphic settings, 60+ fps.  


**Some important things:**  


1. **Shader Cache** must be enabled in NVIDIA settings (GGG told us about it last patch).
2. **Engine Multhithreading** must be enabled in game settings (100%).
3. Enable **Dynamic Resolution** for best performance. Disable it if you always have blur on your screen. For me (GTX 1060 6GB) personally blur appears not very often, so i enable Dynamic Resolution. It helps when Delirium goes really wild.
4. All in game setting on **low**.  


And yes, you must limit PoE.exe with BES every time you start the game. It took like several seconds so no big deal.  


Sorry for my bad englando. But i hope it helps you to fix lags in Delirium :)   


For me right now it's totally lag free, even when screen go wild and i'm flickering all that stuff.",318,1585038183,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo1izh/lags_in_310_fix_unordinary_method/,pathofexile,1

fo0ozf,HaveAShittyDrawing,Large post about performance fixes that I recommend trying.,"Just some info from player that has played since torment. There are many newer players that don't probably know these tips and tricks.

So I thought I should share my settings after seeing how many of you are suffering from dog shit performance with decent rigs here is how I get 100+ fps most of the time with borderless windowed. 
True Full screen gives 70+ fps more.

My system specs: win 10, i5-4570 nvidia 1060 3gb. With single 512gb ssd

**This is not fix for those 0fps drops** and my fps still fluctuates between 70-144 most of the time. 

* First things first. Basic computer maintance: run ccleaner and registry cleanup, check for malvare and clean your computer from dust.

* Delete shaders and minimap catches

C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile

Frees couple of gb memory for older instals, shouldn't affect performance that much.

* multitreading 
- works for some, for me it does effect performance in a negative sence so it is disabled.

* dynamic resolution
- same thing as with multi treading, depends on computer. Test it.

* production_config.ini

Aka extended settings you can find it in : Users\Name\Documents\My Games\Path Of Exile folder

Here is what I am running https://pastebin.com/fccieAQe change resolution to your preference I run 720p for fps boost. Change this line for capping max fps to match your monitors frame rate: framerate_limit_max=144

It isn't perfect, but the game runs decent enough for me. If you change something set the file to ""read only"" in the properities.
You can also make your custom ini. I am not sure what i have changed over the years, there was some testing done probably, maybe. 

Other stuff:
If you run PoE on steam disable steam overlay from settings &gt; in-game and uncheck enable the steam overlay while ingame. This fixed some of my fps issues on destiny 2, not sure if this applies here as well.

*Sound settings
There was recent post that you should check:
https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fjw702/nvidia_users_disable_those_2_for_a_huge/

You could disable sounds via start command, but I don't think that is necessery anymore.


* --waitforpreload and --nopreload
Wiki has explanation for what they do: https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Launch_options

Since Poe Is also CPU oriented game running chrome in backround isn't recommended. 
But since I run poe.trade/reddit on my second monitor I have limited it to medium pririty task using process lasso. You can set up some rules with windows task manager as well,
Like setting PoE to higher priorety task. But I set up few rules in process lasso as well specifically to poe. 
I used Bitsum highest performance profile, and set up following rule to poe in cpu limiter: when cpu usage is over 98%, set it to use one core less for 1 second. 
This was the fix for rdr2 microshutters on pc and I copied it to poe as well.",5,1585033344,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo0ozf/large_post_about_performance_fixes_that_i/,pathofexile,1

For a copy you can interact with, [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12y6-oojO6uFwOrYalUkN2vXBMpQJl4qjK6NhSq3KWjE/), click the link at the top-left in the sheet, or use File -&gt; Make a copy. May require logging in to a Google account.  It's a *lot* of data* and calculation, so copying and sorting can be a bit slow.

This list should contain all monsters capable of being raised as spectres, but some of them on the list may not actually be raisable, such as ones with the ""unusable corpse"" tag, ""CannotBeUsedAsMinion"" mod, or enemies that just don't spawn (Like Snake Flower Man or DrTestopus).

Most stats will update with whatever level is put in the ""Spectre Level"" entry, but a few like resists assume map-level spectres for simplicity.

DPS estimates include the most common skill stats (global damage, cast, or attack speed multipliers), but not more specific stats, nor mods on the monsters themselves, so treat them like a rough guide, rather than gospel.  Also, a lot of more recent enemies have trigger-based skills that I can't parse well or at all.  Furthermore, the AI scripts can heavily impact if or when skills are used, check the PoEDB listings for entries like ""TargetIsPlayer"" or ""IAmNotSpectre"".

fo045y,Kotobeast,Delirium on-death effects are still too frequent and volatile blobs too numerous,"Despite the nerfs, delirium is still not enjoyable due to the sheer amount of on-death/delayed damage and number of volatile pods throughout the map. It makes clearing delirium a chore rather than a fun addition to base content. 

The difference with blight and metamorph, relatively enjoyable content, is that their effects don't constantly try to kill you. With blight, there are only occasional dangerous mob types such as leapers, proximity shields, and bosses. With metamorph, only the encounter at the end of the map is extra dangerous. With delirium you can't choose. No matter how deep or shallow the delirium, you get the same amount of pods and same amount of on-death effects. 

The idea of the league is great, but further changes need to be made in order for it to be enjoyable, repeatable content worthy of inclusion after the league ends.",9,1585030070,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fo045y/delirium_ondeath_effects_are_still_too_frequent/,pathofexile,1

Anyone having performance issues should check this out and try it. It was a literal game changer for me. The sound in this game is majorly tied to performance and the only way to stop the game from using processing power on the sound is to disable it completely through the game files. The obvious downside is that you don't hear any music, abilities, ambient noise, etc. You can still hear the voice dialogue and item drops from your loot filter however. For me it's a no-brainer since I usually listen to music while playing anyway.

1. Tried to do a T16 100% delirium map with a friend (toxic rain miner), he essentially had to offscreen the mobs or get instantly killed, while I couldnt even approach them as double strike / flicker. It was literally impossible to clear the map. Similar experience on lower tiers

2. Most on-death explosions seem to be localised at mob locations, so if youre clearing anything as melee without jumping out between attacks, you're likely to get killed from the sheer amount of stuff going on.

3. Kosis is overtuned in Simulacrum and in maps in general. T10 Kosis with 40% delirium took a solid few minutes to kill, and took off 80% of my HP at times.

But it's not yet enough. I just had to do more than 100 maps to get my first Redeemer spawn. You might think that's just terrible RNG, but let's stop and think at the consequences. Because I couldn't get any conqueror spawn for many hours, I was softcapped as far as atlas content go (t8 max), which softcaps my currency farming and thus my items. One of the appeal of the game is the endless grinding that never stops going up…as long as you progress. But here, the game was stopping my progress with piss-poor rng. 

The atlas is the core of the endgame, there should be no reason that maps of all tiers, except unique and special content (shaper, elder, etc.) should be behind such a rng-dependent mechanic.  
Using pseudo-rngs, Conquerors should spawn in a reasonable amount of playtime, less than 1h in average and no more than 2h if you're-so-unlucky-don't-get-outside-or-you're-going-to-get-corona-from-a-bat.",4,1585015979,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnwzjo/unlocking_more_watchstones_and_conquerors_should/,pathofexile,1

Currently the only way we know to fix this is to relog to reset them when it starts becoming unbearable and almost about to crash usually wave 14-15, we shouldn't have to waste 2 portals just to make the game not a power point presentation

It seems to me that developing simplistic league such as legacy 2.0 would be for benefit of both sides - devolopers and also players

I remembered a similar thing happening to me with the Circus/Harlequin theme boxes. So I thought I'd give the old mystery boxes a whirl again and hope for a portal or wings.

I bought 10.  I received 4 copies of the Scientist Gloves... hmm.  I'm not a mathematician but something seems off.  These are classified as an Uncommon reward with a 35% occurrence rate.  There are 12 possible Uncommon rewards.  I also got the Scientist dog twice, and the Project Gloves for a total of 7 Uncommon rewards.  I also got 2 commons and 1 rare.

So, mathematicians of Reddit I ask this:  What are the odds that I get 4 copies of the Scientist gloves out of 10 tries given numbers are supposed to function as intended?  Did I hit a jackpot??

P.S. - I know this is a small sample size but give me break, I'm not rich enough to buy more.  &lt;3",7,1585013318,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnwbes/mathematician_needed_thaumaturgy_mystery_box_odds/,pathofexile,1

fnvyuj,Matt-As-A-Hatter,2H weapons need to be looked into. Bows are OP.,"It seems as a caster to choose a staff over a bow with a quiver is almost always the wrong choice. Even as a Chieftain I'm looking into bows for Blade Blast.

18% players with bow
8% with staff (50% are using Tremor Rod)
Note: That 8% is warstaff and staff combined.

Bows shoot projectiles. You don't hold the end and cast it like a wand. I feel like this is a weird mechanic forced into by the presence of a quiver with the lack of pairing item for a staff. You lose a slot with no benefit.

I feel like there's room to add another line of items for 2 hand use that don't allow bows to stand out. Staff based, hammer, axe, sword. They all need some love too.

2% 2H sword
0.9% 2H Mace
0.3% 2H Axe

Everyone seems content with 1 6L skill (chest) and as result normally avoid these bases. Kaom's is the only tunic that utilizes the need to link a 2H skill. There could be one that stacks ES and one that does mana. That could also help with the popularity of 2H weapons.",4,1585011923,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnvyuj/2h_weapons_need_to_be_looked_into_bows_are_op/,pathofexile,1

I recently returned from 3.7 and basically play on and off since open beta, but I've never seen some crazy sht like this map mod. I randomly ran a T16, and EVERY three meters was a rare corrupted strongbox ([37 boxes](https://i.imgur.com/YcUL0Cc.png) in total!), sometimes four in a single room, plus two unique boxes. I was like ""wtf, is this a bug"" at first..

I play SSF so finding a 6L is a big deal kinda, even if it's shit. This map alone gave me five sixlinks, four of which I vendored for a divine, but one is actually pretty good. Plus an insane amount of currency and valuable div cards (had four diviner boxes!). Only problem I had was that my lootfilter couldn't handle all the loot anymore. Definitely a lot of fun this mod.

fnuc9x,notSkrublol,Need a build recommendation for last(?) build of the league.,"I already made a couple of level 90 characters and I'm getting burnt out on the league (mostly due to the timer and the absolutely insane lag)

Now i just need a fun build for my last or pre last build of the league. (Wanted to play hollow palm but Mathil made a build with it, so the prices have been launched into space, will make a build with it when prices come down)

My definition of fun is something completely bonkers overpowered that can do anything in the game with ease, would have fast clearspeed,  and have good boss damage. Doesn't have to be super tanky since if you want to survive this league you have to stack defenses to the max anyways which obviously wont happen when you want super high damage and clearspeed, and no I'm not going to play a HoA mana guardian/jugg.

At the moment I'm thinking of CI CoC ice nova/frostbolt assassin, but maybe there are better options?  
I know necromancers are the obvious choice but they did just get nerfed pretty hard. Also I  feel like their clearspeed is only above average, though I'm not sure about that and if you can prove me wrong then necromancer is definitely an option.

My budget is about 12 ex flat, closer to 17-18 ex if i liquidated my whole currency tab. I know its not much but it's enough to get started with most builds and upgrade as i go along.

Tl;dr What would be a super overpowered all content viable  fast-pace build that could get off the floor with about 16-17 ex to start?",12,1585005805,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnuc9x/need_a_build_recommendation_for_last_build_of_the/,pathofexile,1

So I ran a single elder scarab. My next map had Al-Hezmin spawn. After 3 days of trying to get conq influence, and failing, I got it the first map after using an elder scarab.

fnt9uq,TheMrTortoise,Dear GGG: Please stop making things easy,"My current active account is my third account, it is 6 years old. I have been playing this game for ages

I learnt to play hardcore on this game and i love it. That said I have had kids and so play softcore mainly now.

But in all that time I have never sat down looked at league mechanics and gone. Right AOE clear speed -&gt; ED contaigon + blight. I got this.

No I don't f'ing trickster ffs moving to es is a big mistake. I was 3 days in when i threw in the towel. I was proven that infact I did not understand the word inconceivable and I was humbled once again by comedy mechanics.

So I sit down \*for the first time ever\* and theory craft something from scratch to beat this (rather than google some adonis like mathil and pay hyper inflated prices for whatever shitty unique hes made work this week). I have \*layers\* of defence built in from the start. I have inquisitor, no elemental resist on crit, I have my shit planned and sorted. Moreover I have a plan for every stage of the game until about t16 where I dont normally venture beyond.

I start levelling and basically play SSF because \*I FUCKING GOT THIS\*, then you release a patch to make it easy mode. I was like holy fuck my build just got stronk. Flip back to my ed build and its face rolling now. THAT FEELS SO BAD IT MAKES ME WANT TO STOP PLAYING. Dont do this to me. I've played nearly every build in many ways, I love it but I am getting \*seriously\* tired of the 10 acts. I think id prefer to go back to 3\*3 or 3\*4 than the last 5 acts - even though they have great bosses because its less to master and easier to grind - its only people like tyty producing great racing content that keeps me in that. IE that guy is earning you monies - along with all the other community stuff.

Last league I dropped a mirror. It was amazing until I bought a game melting build and was bored to fuck.

You just gave me a mirror in the form of mass nerf. Now im bored, now I cba playing.

&amp;#x200B;

Please, most of your playerbase is gone in 2 weeks. the ones that are left need to quit their bitching and embrace the league. You made this too easy and now you cannot make it harder - big mistake I think thats what I am trying to emphasise. Some of the death effects and mechanics made it exceptionally hard ... fix just those please. Don't make everything trivial.

Im trying to give you a counterpoint to the bleeting. I have fulltime job, 2 kids hardly any time to really invest. But every league has provided a hard challenge and then it gets nerfed. It needs to be hard, it needs to be publicised as 'This Is fucking hard, it will kill you lollalalol'

I was there for the stupid hard races, they were some of the best poe moments.

I just want you to know that I sit here giggling everytime I die because that is the entire point of this game - and I think that is what is being lost. You don't get to choose anything in this game except how you die - people think they can choose not to die and that is \*really\* bad for the game. I can't help but think some of that is people seeing these people hitting 100 and racing for it but not really understanding \*all\* the painstaking work that goes to getting them to that tiny fractional pinacle.

fnsy4j,HairyFur,Why is the Sirus fight still in the state it's in?,"I have now died twice on awakener 8 Sirus.

&amp;#x200B;

This fight is extremely unfun, unfair and plain dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

Issues with the fight:

&amp;#x200B;

* Once you die once in the final stage, it's EXTREMELY difficult to get back in to be able to dps. When you re-enter his circle, he can instantly teleport offscreen and lazer you.

&amp;#x200B;

* Black clouds appearing underneath/in his arena when you are fighting him - again, when you re-enter his circle, often there are now the storm clouds in the arena, but they don't damage you. What they do do is provide zero visual clarity and make it even harder to track Sirus.

&amp;#x200B;

* Actual time available to dps the boss - is practically zero, if GGG think the way to stop people bursting bosses is by turning them into platform  games, they are going completely the wrong way. All this fight is making me think of is pushing for MORE damage, so I can make this terrible phase 3 as short as possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No other boss in POE behaves in this way, bosses should have mechanics that can be read and avoided, and if you make a mistake it's your  fault. You can literally be lazered before Sirus is on your screen if you are re-entering the arena after a death. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at uber atziri, she can one shot 10k and it's hard to avoid BUT, it's fair and telegraphed. That is how a boss should be designed, whoever at GGG thought they were being smart making a boss who kills you with no visual queue needs to to have a serious rethink about what reason they think people play games for.",7,1585000848,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnsy4j/why_is_the_sirus_fight_still_in_the_state_its_in/,pathofexile,1

fnsm0v,TallDann,A Message to GGG,"Path of Exile is an excellent opportunity to itch at my need to play games like Diablo 2, whereas new games like D3 and other tend to have gone in a different direction that I don't enjoy. But this growing disconnect between the devs and player base HAS to stop. Let me elaborate.

Performance Issues - These have been around forever now. We get it, it's a big game with growing content, and tracking these down is a headache. But at this point, acknowledge you have a weakness in designing optimized content. Delirium is a convoluted mess of memory eating sounds, visuals, and monsters that honestly don't add a ton to my entertainment. It seems like the intent was to have an immersive experience, but you accomplished the complete opposite by introducing substantial FPS drops. If the intent of Delirium was to have a ""go deeper"" feel, then why not just have it be an incrementing buff that builds as you move and kill enemies. Why do you need to cover the screen in performance destroying fog, that I can't see through, and that doesn't actually make it clear at all if I'm ""getting deeper""? This segways into my next point.

Challenging is only meaningful if it's interactive - The difficult gimmick of Delirium, FPS jokes aside, is that apparently there are a ton of dangerous pods and on death effects that easily kill through 8k+ HP. Okay, weird choice. But then you mix this with a fog, that makes it substantially difficult to see any of these instant death effects. Would a game where you blindly wander through a mine field and see how many steps you take until you die be fun? Probably not. So why is it fun here? Sure, it's hard. I've died more in delirium already than I think I did in Legion, which is saying something. But it's not meaningfully hard. It's trivial, added difficulty. It's frustrating more so than it's interesting. It doesn't really create much for build diversity, as atm I'm now building into some hyper tank and still dying constantly.

Stop using timers - Seriously. Just stop. Anytime you have something timed, you will always and I mean always push that league towards mass aoe off screen clears. If you want content to be progressed through slowly and experienced, then get rid of damn timers and introduce mechanics that accomplish slowing the game down. Timers are shitty for what you want the game to be, they are shitty for us as players because backtracking ruins immersion, and I just don't get what they ever accomplish. You are adding a DPS check by adding a timer. Why do you want DPS checks in a game that is being slowed down?

Seriously evaluate what a new league mechanic accomplishes - This one is extremely bothersome to me. So far, I've seen refusal to vacuum splinters, and that the existence of self destruct insta death mobs is so that we ""experience the content more"". Is this seriously the best idea your team had for forcing playing to engage with content? Let's talk about proximity shield. The point of proximity shield was to disallow squishy range only builds. It does this in a way that isn't total nightmare. How do you go from designing smart stuff like proximity shield, to instead whatever the heck delirium is? And how the heck is vacuuming little tiny splinters which are otherwise dangerous to pick up because of all these suicidal death mobs that are in this league something that we can't have? No, I don't want to lose 10% exp to pickup a splinter. No, I don't want to backtrack. These are awful. There is a reason delve is so fun to do. In fact, Delve is basically everything that Delirium was trying to accomplish, but not crap like Delirium is. If you don't want to vacuum, make the loot drops at least lower quantity but more impactful. Picking up 300 tiny loot pieces in mobs of death, that is what Delirium is. If you need ideas for how to make player engage with content, simply have minions that need to actually be killed from closer range. You buff bow builds and enable off screen AoE death and then wonder why we all play these builds. 

Seriously GGG, I have genuine faith in yall. But please, really listen to us this time. Delirium is scarily bad. You guys even had a golden chance here with so many of us self isolated due to Corona. And this is the show y'all are putting on. I think y'all forget, that even just the feel of a league reset with good quality of life improvements is very engaging. I don't know why every league reset instead just adds more headaches than it solves.",4,1584999688,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnsm0v/a_message_to_ggg/,pathofexile,1

fnrwvz,LeOpinionHasArrived,Path of Exile - Redemption (Legacy League 2.0),"# Summary

The central league mechanic begins as an alternate leveling method for Levels 1 through 68, leading up to unlocking the Map Device per usual. It would be a league focused on Quality of Life updates, performance, and letting players enjoy their favorite content while leveling - but in a new way! This is how I imagine a sequel to Legacy League should be implemented.

# A New Adventure

In PoE Redemption your Level 1 character begins their adventure in Oriath at a new office managed by the High Templars. You are informed by the Templars that they have paid for your bail and you will work for them until your debt to Oriath is paid in full.

You should have been exiled to Wraeclast, but the Templars are giving you the chance to redeem yourself. This means the Act 1 - Act 10 story is happening at the same time in parallel, but not to us specifically.

The Templars show you a device called the Reality Loom, a Map Device prototype that is activated with Spools of cosmic string!

A long time has passed while you were in the 12th Spool. You are now in the Epilogue leading up to the Atlas of Worlds content.

You are assigned to the Reliquary in Oriath Square where the latest model of Reality Loom has been constructed. It's the Map Device, but it will still accept Spools.

    Tier-13 Spool - 5 Zones Area Level 56 to Area Level 60 (+3 Skill Points)
    Tier-14 Spool - 5 Zones Area Level 61 to Area Level 65 (+3 Skill Points)

                    2 Ascendancy Points &amp; Resistance Penalty 3 of 3
    
    Tier-16 Spool - 1 Zone containing Zana

Zana admonishes you for helping the Templars create a functioning Map Device. As she introduces you to the Atlas of Worlds, one of the Exiles you didn't pick (Witch, Scion, Duelist, etc) appears in the map instance, summons a Projection, and tries to kill you both! Zana casts a spell that causes the instance to begin to decay, and you barely make it out in time.

This chronologically takes us back to the Epilogue as we know it currently - Picking up the Pieces.

# Spools of Cosmic String

Spools ranging from Tier-1 to Tier-16 are reusable quest objects that function like Maps, except you weave them into a custom experience using an interface similar to Metamorph's.

The Spools are destroyed after you successfully complete it, which is when you'll obtain the Spool for the next tier. You do this until all 16 Spools are complete, which should give players a full leveling experience (complete with Ascendancy points) leading up to the Atlas of Worlds content.

Spools have 2 to 5 zones. They're generated as instances similar to how Synthesis League handled memories, and each zone is customized by the player based on the Cosmic Threads of their choice. Each Spool instance can have six attempts, and certain objectives (IE: Blight,Delve) will return you to Oriath (consuming an attempt) if you fail it.

I am going to assume the rewards these zones grant will scale with area level, as content in PoE typically behaves.

**Delirium Thread**

&gt;This zone is affected by a layer of Delirium  
&gt;  
&gt;Additional threads have 20% higher intensity  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat Kosis (if they're present)

**Metamorph Thread**

&gt;Monsters in this Spool drop Metamorph parts  
&gt;  
&gt;This zone has 2 additional unique monsters  
&gt;  
&gt;Final Zone Objective - Defeat the Metamorph

**Blighted Thread**

&gt;This zone contains a 2 minute Blighted Map encounter  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Protect the Pump

**Legion Thread**

&gt;This zone contains a Legion Monolith  
&gt;  
&gt;Additional threads are more likely to add Generals  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat the Generals (if they're present)

**Betrayal Thread**

&gt;This zone contains a single-person Safehouse raid  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat the Syndicate boss

**Delve Thread**

&gt;This zone is in a small, randomly instanced Azurite Mine  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Guide the cart to its destination

**Abyss Thread**

&gt;This zone is underground in the abyssal depths and contains an Abyss boss  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat the Abyss boss

**Harbinger Thread**

&gt;This zone's occupants are replaced with Harbingers  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat the Harbingers

**Breach Thread**

&gt;This zone is in a Breachlord's domain  
&gt;  
&gt;Zone Objective - Defeat the Breachlords (if they're present)

**Perandus Thread**

&gt;This zone is similar to the Perandus Manor map  
&gt;  
&gt;Additional threads increase the chance of encountering Cadiro

# End Game Spools

Once you make it to the Atlas of Worlds Spools and Threads will begin to drop as regular loot. The Spools and Threads that drop in the Epilogue are not quest items, they're normal items. Therefore they can be modified with currency items, and we can assume there would be Unique ones too.

One of the Unique Spools could be a end-game boss encounter with the Godslayer, a powerful exile of legend who was banished to Wraeclast and eventually slayed Kitava. (You know, the player characters that weren't us this time around!)

fnrr77,mzypsy,A petition to GGG: please extend the season for one month,"While the DC server is down, I am petitioning GGG to extend the current season for another month, even though it just started less than 2 weeks ago. Here are my reasons:

1. [New Zealand is having a month long lockdown due to the coronavirus crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/kiwis-go-home-new-zealand-to-go-into-month-long-lockdown-to-fight-coronavirus).  So all the staffs in GGG need a break or work at home. The game is great at the moment, and your staffs deserve that break. The players definitely want the great team to bring us new contents in the future.
2. The additional month buys GGG some time to test the new contents for the next season. The current season have some issues in the beginning, which you guys are already trying your best to address. I believe that many of these issues could be addressed well before it goes online, if GGG test them more. With the current virus crisis I believe that the test for the next patch will be very limited. With the additional month, you guys can do more tests and bring us a less-buggy game.
3. GGG could do some activities to fill this month. Maybe do a flashback season like in the past, or have a SSFHC competition to encourage people to play deadeye/slayer.",0,1584996902,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnrr77/a_petition_to_ggg_please_extend_the_season_for/,pathofexile,1
fnrqrt,Boboar,Delirium timer is clearly a developer's baby but it needs to die.,"At this point, there are no compelling arguments being made as to why the timer should exist. It seems to go against every overarching development sentiment such as slowing down the meta and making things challenging and rewarding, etc. 

Thousands of people are complaining about the timer on a daily basis and it is the cause of so many ""feels bad"" moments in gameplay. Can't loot because the fog is moving. Can't do master missions and other league content because the fog is moving. Can't go into vaal side areas cause the fog is moving. Can't do bosses with phases cause the fog is moving (although who does these anyway). Even after engaging a boss there's no feeling of relief because you can get it down to 5% health but if the fog passes you get nothing. 

The fog makes everything else feel worse to do and it is literally only because of the timer. Imagine if some maps it was impossible to complete a blight encounter just because of the map layout. Or if you had to loot killed mobs in an incursion while still inside the incursion otherwise you lose the loot. That's what the timer feels like to pretty much everyone.

Remove the timer and suddenly master missions are more compelling. Bosses can be experienced with fog effects. Players can actually interact with the league mechanic instead of racing through and collecting loot by backtracking at the end (which feels TERRIBLE).

To date the developers have made numerous changes to the mechanics of the game, (some of which are still broken unless I'm not expected to be able to surpass 4-2 loot) and it still feels bad to play delirium without the orbs.

The only two reasons I can see them sticking with the timer are because of the orbs or because the devs who came up with the idea for the moving fog are too enamoured with it to admit it sucks. If it's the orbs, well that's easy. The orbs guarantee that particular loot type in addition to the normal random loot and also increases the difficulty by a set amount. Boom. Problem solved.

So what is it, GGG? Who's baby is delirium? The baby has cancer. We can operate now and save it or you can let it grow and kill the league.

Please make the right choice.",472,1584996858,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnrqrt/delirium_timer_is_clearly_a_developers_baby_but/,pathofexile,1

fnri8g,Archangel_117,"Delirium should go core, but only the Orbs, not as a random map encounter.","Despite the shaky start and overall community response, Delirium is essentially mechanically well-received. The issues that do exist aren't all directly attributable to the league content and the way in which it is engaged with. Performance is certainly an issue, but one that has been for a while. Delirium only exacerbated an already present problem there. Monster Health and Damage is tuneable, but not a functional problem with the league mechanic itself.


All in all, the only glaring problem that *is* directly attributable to the mechanical function of the league itself is the fog timer in the regular Delirium encounters. Going forward, this could present an issue in conflicting with the way other content is interacted with if Delirium Mirrors are a 10% map mechanic like other league content. Finding a Mirror midway through or at the end of the map would be terrible, since the value of the Mirror is directly diminished by other content you may have completed on the way. Orbs however work in a much preferred manner, allowing control and scaling of the content by the player.


For core implementation, the 10% chance of league encounter could be moved to a 10% chance for the map boss to drop a Delirium Orb, falling in line with GGG's desire to continue to make boss engagements desirable.",73,1584996066,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnri8g/delirium_should_go_core_but_only_the_orbs_not_as/,pathofexile,1

I killed him countless time at Awakening 8 deathless and never encountered a bug and found the fight ok-ish despite his poor design.  

I just killed him at A5 as soon as I had 20 watchstones. Oh boy, I did some prep but I wasn't excepting that. I entered the arena, go near the boss as usual, as soon as Sirus appears on my screen I'm dead. A meteor one shot me without any indication on the ground or whatever. Ok cool, maybe it's just a visual bug.

I go back in the arena, no more weird invisible attack so I go under him to get him off his throne. He doesn't want. I try once more. Nope. Once again ? Nope. I literally ran for 2-3 minutes under him until he finally decided to come down.   

Ok cool, can we fight now ? Nope ! As soon as he gets down, I cast a frostbolt, getting ready to get in position and spam Ice Nova on my sweet frostbolt. Except that the same exact frame my frostbolt goes through him, he get back on his throne and spawn a storm. 

I kite him out of his storm, go under him and get ready to fight again. He comes down, same stuff I cast frostbolt, he mounts his throne again and pop another storm. Three fucking times in a row without me being able to remove a single digit of his Energy Shield.

After that the fight went as it should have been since the beginning. All in all I spent something like 5-6 minutes before I could actually fight him. Also fuck the camera.

fnqh0x,halberdierbowman,"alternative ""timers"" requiring killing mobs, not walking in fog","Imho the disappearance of Delirium fog could be based either on how recently it's been since you opened a nest or on how many mobs are being killed. The core loop is killing mobs then collecting loot, not platforming from one place to another. In Incursions/Zana maps, you get more time by killing mobs or touching standing stones, and I think we can take the best of all these ideas. Delirium seems pretty cool, so I just want to offer a couple alternates to the fog timer mechanic.  


**Overlapping breaches option**: about one screen of fog could be spawned each time you trample a nest, and each nest would reveal a few more nests to trample. This would also give a strategic decision of trampling the traps that don't have mobs, because maybe it's worth it in order to expand the fog. Rather than having a global timer, each of these puffs would evaporate on their own hidden timer, so the fog is expanding in front of you and disappearing behind you. If this is too much calculation, then there could just be one timer that increments itself by trampling nests/killing mobs, and all the fog could disappear together. Rather than depth being based on distance, it could be based on how many overlapping fog layers there are, a closer proxy to how quickly you're progressing.  


**Wave defense option**: the fog should have an invisible (or not?) strength counter that decrements when monsters spawn and increments when monsters are killed or nests are trampled. Each second, 20% of the total will be spent to spawn mobs (in addition to the nest mobs). This means that if you are continuously one-shotting mobs as they spawn, they'll continue to spawn at an increasing rate until they're so tanky that you can't kill them and they naturally spawn less. If you're failing to kill the mobs, the fog will evaporate on its own. This will feel more player-influenced and gameplay loop-relevant, because it will be based on your primary goal of killing mobs as fast as possible. The more mobs are alive, the higher the floor of the fog is, so the fog will evaporate when the counter reaches the strength floor of the existing mobs. Mobs can be spawned from the direction of the center of the current fog, to entice players in that direction quickly (or do I have time to grab that loot?).  


I think both of these options give players a stronger feeling that their actions are directly impacting the fog, and both would reward the player for actively participating in killing mobs. They would also allow for the difficulty to ramp itself up as quickly as the player could handle along a logistic curve, meaning that players would always be rewarded for having a better build.

You can play for 8h a day for a week, and don't have enough legion splinters to open a battle. Even if you could, no jewel would drop. Even if it would, you have 99/100 chance of it being a useless one. Breachlords drop 0 loot most of the time. But the whiff! They can drop the good stuff! Just keep playing! The awakened gems, I've killed like 100 atlas bosses combined from this and the last league, no single one dropped. Killed awakener lvl 8 around 20 times, no sword, no orb, no nothing.

fnoeon,Coyoteee12,This league is bad.,"Long time player here, been pretty hardcore since abyss but played for 2 or 3 leagues prior to that. This league flat out sucks imo. It's not the league mechanic for me that has made it awful. It is not the one shot mechanics. To me the worst part of the league is nothing seems viable. By viable i mean fun and doesn't die every two seconds. 

So far I leveled a EDC which felt like it took too long to get its damage off in delirium due to the agro nature of the mobs in there, this guy was not very geared. From this I tried the bleed rain of arrows build. This one wasn't bad but also not great since damage isnt front loaded, it left a lot of room for bs to occur. Next I tried the poison variant of BV. This one was fine killing things and honestly my best experience this league but still died way too much. Spent 2 days at 90 due to deaths. BV was pretty substantially geared as well. From there I wanted to try a wander, i made the mistake of rolling scion ascendancy.  I couldn't get the damage scaling properly by BA so I retired that guy there. Next I rolled with a Archmage storm brand. I read that a lot of people are doing well with these. To me the damage was ok, however game play for mapping feels clunky.  Finally i bit the bullet and rolled that character into a mana gaurd in hopes to just bang out league achievements, get the wings and be done with this league. All was fine until I got to Sirius. Couldn't manage to get over 20 stacks for HoA until the corridor part, but that's no longer a free damage part for casters, so I phased him and tried following him around as he teleported every two seconds. Me not able to maintain stacks  couldn't deal enough damage. 

Open to suggestions on what could potentially clear all content and not make this game a chore. So far I have a fairly good setup for mana guard but dont think he will be viable without watchers eye and some of the really expensive corruptions.",14,1584985982,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnoeon/this_league_is_bad/,pathofexile,1

fno7rq,Wuffkeks,The loot dilemma,"Disclaimer: This post is from the view of a casual player, this may not apply to people who played 200 hours since league start.

Path of Exile is in most cases a grinding game. Regardless of what you build you will grind with most likely more than doing other stuff. Yes challenges are a thing, map completion and the story also but for most of theses stuff you need to grind to find gear or buy gear from other players. While the first is easy until a certain point it becomes really hard to find anything that upgrades your gear at some point. Luckily there is the option to trade with other players and this is where the grind comes from. You need currency to buy stuff, and here comes the dilemma. Due to the quite different rarity of currency most things you find is not that much worth. All other currency types are outshined by exalted orbs.

Right now exalted orbs are around 130-140 chaos orbs. Fusings are 270-280 neccesary and below that it will be hard to trade even for exalts because the trade window is to small. Sure you can trade your way up but every drop is basically worthless if you drop an exalt. I exclude all the higher tier stuff because most casual players wont see a mirror or one of the special exalts early in a league.

Additional to that most uniques are worthless, rares that are worth more than a few chaos are only to be found if you ident every good base and most of the other stuff (catalyst, gemcutter, incubators, fossils, etc.) is mostly used on your self and wont be sold in bulk to make it comparable to an exalt.

This league shows it again in a way that is more benefical to run 20 low tier maps to get an exalt drop than to run 5 high tier maps in the same time. At least as a casual player.

I dont know what can be done at this but i find it kinda awful that i cant get exited for basically any drop that is not at least exalt level. If you find a few early in the league you can get your character to a reasonable power level to get through basically any content and need to start a new character to even find a way to ""better"" yourself without grinding hours over hours to hope that another few exalts drop for a possible upgrade.

fnnvvm,Euphmoria,"Proposed change: Delirium mirrors: 20% LESS monster damage, 200% MORE monster life.","&gt;!The content of this post applies only to the delirium mechanic, not sirus or graphic bugs or whatever else is aggravating this subreddit.!&lt;

I hate making the game easier, I really do. League has been out for 10 days and I have 6D16.5Hr /played so when I read reddit I feel frustrated and annoyed by alot of these reddit posts asking for nerfs, and I think alot of the more ""dedicated"" or ""hardcore"" players  also feel the same way.

But I have also realized that when you kill people for what seems like no reason, the only thing they get out of the experience is frustration. A lot of new players simply don't have the game knowledge to know that having 300 more ehp, or 10% more block, or taking MoM would've saved them from dying. Having 20% more survivability will eliminate 80% of your deaths at endgame. 

So for the delirium mirrors found in maps: remove 20% of monster damage so players stop getting 1shot, double monster life so players still feel like the content is challenging and motivated to progress, and the content isn't just nerfed. It's much easier to see your progress when you build damage than it is when you build defense, because a good defense just means not dying, while more damage feels like more rewards, positive reinforcement.  

The timer stays, the mechanic exists to  push players to enhance their exiles. Ie: Before you could only do 10% of the map, now you can do 50%, that's progress, wraeclast isn't a place for handouts. 

Most top end players are now farming maps using delirium orbs so the changes to the mirror mechanics shouldn't have a huge impact on the economy.",5,1584984356,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnnvvm/proposed_change_delirium_mirrors_20_less_monster/,pathofexile,1
fnnv76,BenjaCarmona,"Petition to get something like ""combined skills"" into the game.","These last patches have introduced some different ""active"" gems that modify other active gems, like spellslinger and bane. This + my early experience in beta, where I didnt knew before getting to Brutus that ""support gems"" were a thing (back then you got your first support gem at lvl 8 getting into the prison) and thinking that you would link different skill gems to get something new, got me thinking about an idea that I would love seeing in the game: Combined skills that are unlocked by llinking two skills with some kind of affinity.

You would get 4 skills in total (at least I thought about it like that): The two base skills + two extra skills, one each more similar to one of the base skills.

One example: Ice crash + Tectonic Slam. You get Ice Slam and Tectonic Crash.

Ice Slam: The cold version of tectonic slam, you get the same effects but you instead consume frenzy charges and instead of converting damage to fire you convert to cold, also the colour of the slam is now white/blueish. Since you get one less link, you get some damage from the combination (or you can tweak the numbers to make it in line with other skills that can get 5 regular supports).

Tectonic Crash: Same concept, you get the fire version of Ice Crash, with changed visuals and changed scalling, you convert to fire and you do a fiery crash.

This allows for some different playstyles, since you can now have, for example, a Raider using Ice Slam and Ice crash for different purposes (like Ice Slam for clear and Ice Crash for single target). I would of course give a bonus to damage to the base skills if they are linked with their respective affinity skills, to keep them in line with the rest.

I would love to see something like this with different skills, since it opens tons of different possibilities for different builds and gameplay styles!",5,1584984297,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnnv76/petition_to_get_something_like_combined_skills/,pathofexile,1

fnn6nn,Sacr0,Question regarding Archmage and Indigon (bug or intended functionality?),"Hi, 

i've found a downside regarding the combined use of archmage and indigon and wanted to check if that is intended behaviour or a bug.

Archmage reads:  ""Supported Skills gain Added Lightning Damage equal to (70-127)% of Mana Cost, if Mana Cost is not higher than the maximum you could spend ""

Let's assume i have 4k maximum mana and no mana reserved. i use blade vortex with archmage and some fevered mind jewels in tree. I DO NOT have indigon equipped . mana cost is 3.8k. Everything works fine, i get a huge lightning dmg boost.

If i do the same but DO HAVE have indigon equipped, something strange happens: first, my mana costs goes up to 8k+ due to indigon increased mana cost of skills per mana spent. Fine, but here it comes: **I will loose all the added lightning damage from archmage support, because the mana cost is now ""higher than the maximum you could spend"" as the archmage gem reads. Even the already casted bv will loose it's flat lightning dmg bonus.** Is this intended behaviour?

fnm1lm,freetimeisthebest,Next League - Path of Exile: Optimization (Patch Notes 3.11 Preview),"#**Content Update 3.11.0 Patch Notes Preview -- Path of Exile: Optimization**

##**The Optimization Challenge League**

- Challenge leagues are a great opportunity for a fresh start in a new economy. All of your old characters and items are still present in the Standard and Hardcore leagues, but you're encouraged to join the new leagues, complete challenges and demonstrate your mastery of Path of Exile!
- You'll experience Optimization in each area of the Optimization Challenge League. Upon entering the area, your gaming PC will run at maximum FPS and your computer will run cool. Inside the Optimization, optimized monsters appear and existing foes become more dangerous. Pushing deeper into the Optimization will increase visual clarity and grant even more rewards.
- Among the spoils you may find Mirror Shards. 
- You may also acquire Optimization Orbs from high-level Optimization encounters. Optimization Orbs can be applied to maps, enhancing the whole map area in visual clarity. You'll also find Optimization fragments which can be combined to gain access to the Optimization Realm. It is in the Optimization Realm that you'll find visual clarity and most rewarding fights.
- With 3.11.0, there are Standard, Hardcore and Solo Self-Found variations of the Optimization challenge league available. They have the same core mechanics and items. You can create private league versions of these leagues, with mods that make the game harder.
- The new challenge leagues include a set of 40 new challenges. When you complete 12 challenges, you will receive the Optimization Halo effect. When you reach 24 challenges, you will receive the Optimization Pet. At 36 challenges completed you'll receive the Optimization Armour Set. These microtransactions are only obtainable in this league.
- From the 19th challenge onwards and for every third challenge after that, you will receive pieces of the Optimization Totem Pole decoration to display in your hideout. The Totem Pole permanently showcases how many of the Optimization challenges you completed during the league and increases the FPS in your hideout.
 

##**Major New Content and Features**
- There is no new major content.
- An auction house has been added to the game. Players can place up to a maximum of 5 items in the auction house every hour.
- No new gems are introduced.
- All gems and skills have been nerfed.
- Movement speed boots have been capped to 30% increased Movement Speed.
- Maximum movement speed is hard capped at 150% increased Movement Speed.
- Removed Talisman, Torment, Delirium, and Perandus mechanics.
- Bots will be actively removed. Submitting tickets and taking videos and/or screenshots to help us aid removing bots will award players with a free Weta pet microtransaction!
- Added the Optimization realm, an endgame encounter accessible by collecting four Optimization Fragments from Optimization encounters. - Take on a sequence of increasingly difficult fights for more and more Mirror Shards.
- Removed 50 uniques from the game not designed by Supporters.
- Removed 50 Divination Cards not designed by our Supporters.
- Added a new type of currency, Optimization Orbs, which can be applied to maps to plunge the entire area into Optimization. Each Orb also adds new rewards to the map, and each map can have up to five Optimization Orbs applied. Be careful, as each Orb will also make the map substantially more optimized.",3,1584978147,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnm1lm/next_league_path_of_exile_optimization_patch/,pathofexile,1

fnm1bi,Lossen,Looking for players. Active and social for private leagues.,"  

**Hello there fellow Exiles.**  
 

We’re a bunch of lads, mostly *dutch* and *danes*, who are playing private league during every league start. We’re about 5-12 active players every league, but looking to expand our player base in our guild, as we’d like more guys to participate. I don’t wanna sit here and tell you we’ve got some requirements, but ideally we’d like guys to be atleast a certain age, as we’re all ranged from 25-40 and we’re very active on our discord during our grinding sessions. We’re helping each other out and put a lot of effort into the social aspect, as we host lans during league starts aswell as invite the dutch guys up to the danes for events.  
 I know this might be a long shot, but if you sit out there and feel like trade league is boring and would like a challenge gear-wise, aswell as having an extra bit of fun and need someone to play with in a more closed setup, please let me know through either PM or here in the comments. We’ve got guys who have got a playtime range of 300-4k hours, so there is space for newcomers aswell as the more ‘hardcore’ grinders and experienced players.  
 

And for the rest of you, I hope you would be willing to comment with any input or if anything is on your mind, as we’d like the visibility to create a bigger community. **Thank you for your time.**",0,1584978121,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnm1bi/looking_for_players_active_and_social_for_private/,pathofexile,1

fnm12j,_symp_,Why does GGG still get the benefit of the doubt every League?,"Sure, reddit is protesting about several things which is the absolute right thing to do when you consider the state of the game

-Performance is in a absolutely disgusting and unplayable state for many many people. There are so many people that actually cant play your game GGG and its already released for 10 days, when do you fix this? (And no the patch from today didnt help most people, me included)

-Delirium mechanic itself, backtracking,visibility,doing other mechanics in delirium(picking alva room/betrayal for example)

-Perfomance while playing in a group, this is a problem since how long?
There are many more things I could list but these are some important points and maybe others can point some more out that need a revision.

At the end of the day GGG will fix maybe even all of this in the upcoming weeks and everyone is happy again so GGG can repeat the same thing for the next leaguestart again. Its a cycle that repeats itself every season for the last 4-5 maybe more leagues. 

And to clarify this at the end, I love the game, I love GGG, what they do and did to the game and its progession but there are clearly things that need to be addressed and changed not only for this league but for the future leagues.",15,1584978093,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnm12j/why_does_ggg_still_get_the_benefit_of_the_doubt/,pathofexile,1

The other half, me included, are so infuriated of the treatment that GGG gave Sirius that I can't possibly grasp on what grounds they were made. Quite a few are old school PoE players, and we all had little to no succes with the current changes:  


\- in the last phase, his audio queue has been toned down to the level that it is allmost impossible to hear once the beam is shot. Result is usually that you die.

\- the choice of zooming in the angle (was an issue pre patch as well), makes it impossible for you to predict the direction of his skills. Result is usually that you die. 

\- The choice of increasing the beam size takes up the majority of visibility that in combination with the two above gets you to a point where your overview is close to zero. Result is usually that you die. 

The ones above is just some of the few, yet very frustrating to experience. I get that the boss needs to be different, but the way I see it, a perfect boss is Uber Elder. If you know his mechanics and don't lack offenses/defences, you suceed. If you don't you die. This is the optimal setting of a boss.

So basically I crafted on my warlords gloves to get culling strike. I multimodded them and thought I can craft life and hybrid life which seems to not work tho.

So I have an open prefix on them now and thought about what I can do with them.
I saw there is a mod 10 % chance to get unnerve or something like that. It's a hunters prefix.
If I slam a Hunters Orb on these gloves, will it only add a random hunters Prefix? Or can it has other ""normal"" outcomes aswell?

fnlfsz,Throwawayacc666x,Trading and niche items,"Hello everyone!  


This post is meant as a sort of message to the PoE community and more precisely BAD sellers.

As someone that plays only self-made builds, I tend to use a lot of items that other people have no use of. Do to that, I always end up having hundreds of exalts in currency, but little to none gear upgrades to spend them on.

My ""upgrades"" however are (as you can guess by the title) some very niche items that are considered trash by most of the playerbase.  In rare cases, they are something that can be considered more expensive. An example would be a Coral Ring with incursion %ES and t1 light radius with an open suffix (just an example really, never got anything like it but it's to make things clearer). An item like that would cost probably 1 chaos, if someone even puts one like it for trade.

As you can see by that, the supply of my very specific items is insanely low, and I usually can only catch one per league, since nobody bothers selling them. They do exist however, and sometimes I do find some and then wait for hours for the seller to come online.

Now, the usual way I find them is by someone dumping them in their public tab and in most cases they are not priced.  In many cases, they've been sitting in people's stash for a week or more. Of course, to make people actually willing to bother selling them, I usually offer a decent amount of currency, often an ex and over. Because as we all know, nobody will bother leaving their map to sell you a 1c item.

So what's the problem with all that? The problem is people increasing the price. Say I offered an ex for the above mentioned ring - it's complete garbage, but the person will ignore my whisper and then list the item for 2 exalts. When I whisper again, they will once more get greedy and up the price to say 5 exalts. The amount of times this has happened is really frustrating. And every time people do this, I have to wait for another item which might not happen, and they end up with an item that won't ever sell.

I'd like to use this paragraph as a message to every seller out there - if you want more money for your item, that's fine, but reply to the offer and we can make a deal, instead of just raising the price over and over and ignoring the only person interested in the item. I am sure many people would be grateful if everyone started actually interacting with the interested buyer instead of just endlessly trying to squeeze a bit of extra currency and ending up with nothing.",13,1584975950,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fnlfsz/trading_and_niche_items/,pathofexile,1

This solves a few things


1) Players get to engage/play their build for 90-95% of the fight

2) Helps minion or other builds with corpses

3) Restores flasks

4) Fits with the story - Sirus conquered both Shaper and Elder, but was corrupted in strange ways by them
