But I still mostly get fish and really little “treasures”. I can stand there for up to an hour and still only have gotten like 3 or 4 books and a few fishing rods and bows but loads of fish?

fsoadb,Aurora1324,"Does anyone play Minecraft Bedrock Edition on Mac? If so, read below...","I have a MacBook and have Minecraft bedrock on it. Unfortunately I have to use a Linux Launcher in order to access it but I ran into a few problems so far:

1) First couple of months I used it, it ran okay but shortly after I began to run into a ""nonzero"" error for versions newer than 1.12.1.1. Once newer versions began to come out I wasn't able to access certain servers/realms/worlds. Shortly after I was completely unable to access anything. 

\-&gt; To expand onto this, someone created codes which you had to download onto your computer and it allowed you to access version 1.13.0. Unfortunately I'm still unable to access worlds/realms.

2) A few days ago I ran into another problem: the server I usually play on displayed a message when I tried to join ""outdated server"". I talked to a few people and they suggested i uninstall and reinstall everything. I have yet to try this but I doubt it'll do anything for me considering only version 1.13.0 is playable right now.

\~ If anyone can help please let me know, I'm not sure what exactly to do nor do I know of someone who can help. I seek either new places i can access Minecraft Bedrock from on my mac or a solution to the problem as a whole.

Here is the linux launcher: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIF47GiyMOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIF47GiyMOs)

fso0f8,ImDoo_liss,Speedrunners hear me out.,"Someone should start a series where you accept world seeds from people voting on them. And you race through on their seeds. 

I played a random world last night. And while I'm somewhat familiar with minecraft speedruns, I'm no minecraft speedrunner. In that world I'm 100% certain that world in the right hands would make the world record. I just wish it wasn't wasted on me lmao. I beat the game, someone whose only ever watched minecraft speedruns, in about 2 and a half hours last night. That wasnt even my intention. I was just messing around and saw how good this world was. And it just kept getting better.


I play on xboxone so im bedrock (oof). But let me tell you about it anyways.

I spawn in a desert. Next to a village. But wait. I see another one in the distance. Excellent. Loot those.

Walk out with 65 bread. Not bad id say. Then see a Sahara in the distance. Cool. Immediately gravel in the river bed. I grab flint. Look up. What do ya know. Another village.

On my way i find a lava pit. I'm like &lt;1000 blocks from spawn. So sahara village. Has cauldron and fletcher thing. I dont know how to do the villager reset thing. But I just waited it out and l got my pearls. Made a quick portal. The nether kinda sucked. Just a tad. But i made it work. But i left the portal. Threw an eye. And looked around. Where did it go? Oh, it went to my feet! Dig down and low and behold. I'm already above the strong hold. It has the absolute worst silver fish infestation ive ever seen. However I still made it to the portal decided to make some armor. And went in.

I died like twice but i still did it all in under 3 hours. 

Which leads me back to my first sentence. I want someone who maybe doesn't suck. To run that seed. I want to see what other amazing (or maybe awful) seeds people can send in for someone good at the game to take on. Thats my 2 cents thanks for coming to my ted talk.

I wanted to know what i could do to use up the massive space I have, any suggestions?",6,1585693508,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsmt9r/moving_into_a_woodland_mansion/,Minecraft,2

fsmr2u,BurakHitman,Quick question. Does anybody remember the name of a YouTube hero brine series that started with all of the characters going to a place on a large boat?, It was meant to be completely fictional and had a higher production value than most at the time. Would have been maybe 8 years ago that I watched it. Just looking for that nostalgia hit during lockdown.

for a few days I'm trying to have just night in minecraft. I LOVE dark mode and sometimes my eyes just burning for the day. I do NOT want the mods that will turn you world to always night as light level will be at 0. Thats the problem. I wasn't able to find the way to just change the day sky texture to black or just night sky texture. Any ideas?

Thanks

fsmmzy,Act__,"We're making a UHC server for some friends, and I need some help.","Hey all! So my friends and I are making a UHC type server for us to play on. Here's the plan.We all will have 2 days to collect items and get ready to fight. You'll be able to collect items anywhere from 2500X to -2500X, same with Z. You'll be able to travel to the Nether, but not the end. During the 2 day ""Grace Period"" PVP will not be allowed and if a player dies, they will keep all their items. After that everyone will be put on a simulated Hardcore mode, so if they die they will be put into spectator.

I have couple of questions on how to do certain things. For some extra information, the server is running Spigot 1.15.2.I can't find a way to make it so that after the grace period, if someone dies, they'll be put on spectator.I can't find a way to slowly shrink the border without killing the players who may be offline when it is shrinking. I can't find a way to disable the end. I want to disable the Nether once the border gets to less then 500 blocks, but I can't find a way to do this without killing the players that were in the nether at the time.

Does anyone know how to do any of the above things? Thank you!",1,1585692961,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsmmzy/were_making_a_uhc_server_for_some_friends_and_i/,Minecraft,2

I’m not sure if this is the place to post this (if it isn’t, I’ll gladly delete it) but, I recently started playing Minecraft again, after almost 5 years. I had a really crappy PC which was the reason I kinda stopped playing. 

But now, as I have a good laptop (not the best but really not the worst), I can’t understand why the game only runs in a 45-50fps. I have a Core-i5-9300h with a GTX 1650. Are these frames normal for this type of hardware or if this isn’t normal, do you know what I can do to make it run better? 

Also, there are some weird white lines between the blocks: any idea why?

fsl1qs,tahirtayyab,Bedrock version feels...too easy,"Hey everyone. Hope you're doing well. I'm not sure if it's just me but mob spawning (especially of monsters) seems nerfed in the Bedrock edition compared to the Java one

This is with me playing on 'hard' mode setting in both games. Monsters spawn much more frequently in Java and I've encountered often groups of many zombies etc continuously while in a cave. On the other hand, Bedrock's caves seem almost uninhabited and yes, the mobs are definitely there but in substantially lower numbers

Now obviously everyone has their own feel of how a game is defined as 'difficult' but I had a lot more fun in Java due to the added challenge. Just wondering if anyone else feels the same. I mostly play on the switch by the way and occasionally on PC

I design **a new biome for the Nether called The Abyss.** The main feature is due of **the mist** **that ashes formed**, your vision will be affected, so you need to use **""Soul light""** (Soul fire, torches, lanterns) to **purify areas.**

Here the change-log:

\-**New block** Ashed Netherrack (I am not very good with block textures...)

\-**Mist!** This will affect the player's vision until soul light purify an area.

\-**New Particle** Ashes falling from the Ashed Netherrack!

\-**Fatu, a brand new mob!** From blazes' family, here arrives the fatus. Exclusive mobs from The Abyss who lights this terrifying  biome! They are very hostiles, so careful to bother them!

\-**Forgotten Towers!** New structures that was inhabit by mysterious creatures long time ago.

\-**New Item called Light Ashes!** An exclusive item from this biome that will use for alchemy stuff.

\-**The sentence, the status effect of doomed souls...** This status effect for potions will deal damage to nearby hostile mobs around eight blocks radius.

This isolation period I decided to try and do all game advancements on Hardcore mode. On my ninth attempt I spawned on a tiny island in the deep ocean biome. Immediately saw an Ocean Monument. Thought I was lucky. Did some exploring and found out I was within 30 sec boat ride of three!

Are they this common in the right area? I thought they were pretty rare. Never explored an ocean monument before and have just been getting ready. Also made my base on a nearby island that had a mine shaft directly below it!

fskg0j,kristen87forever,A couple of commands that might make your creative world a bit easier,"these are just a couple quality of life commands that make my creative worlds just slightly easier. 

/give @ p minecraft:diamond\_leggings{strength:5,display:{Lore:\[""\\""Strength V\\""""\]}}

* gives you a pair of leggings that have a tag that allow them to be targeted by following command. and a fancy name

effect give @ a\[nbt={Inventory:\[{Slot:101b,tag:{strength:5}}\]}\] minecraft:strength 1 4 true

* when put in a repeating command block it will target your leggings and give you strength 5 as long as you wear them allowing you to kill most mobs in a few hits, saving you the hassle of having to grab a sword out of the creative inventory. (ex. it takes 2 punches to kill a villager compared to 3 swings plus the time it takes to grab a sword. maybe not much but it makes my life easier lol)

/give @ p minecraft:diamond\_boots{jump:3,display:{Lore:\[""\\""Jump III\\""""\]}}

* same as before pretty much but more bouncy applied to boots

effect give @ a\[nbt={Inventory:\[{Slot:100b,tag:{jump:3}}\]}\] minecraft:jump\_boost 1 2 true

* maybe not a game changer but if you use an elytra a lot to travel your creative worlds (or maybe i'm weird) it makes it easier to activate it  (more jump = more time in the air = more time to activate elytra) plus its fun to just jump everywhere.

(p.s. dont put a space in between the @ and the a or the p)

fsidoz,BeastCoder,"UPDATE #2 - Downloading Pictures For List of Seeds - ""Good Seed Generator"" [Devlog] [Java] [Bedrock]","# Intro
Hey everyone and welcome back to another devlog update post for my ""good-seed-generator"". In this update, I built off of the last thing I built: a list-of-seeds generator. 


# Research
The research for this update includes:
* A video on threading from Corey Schafer: https://youtu.be/IEEhzQoKtQU  This video helped because it showed me that I needed multiprocessing **not** threading
* A video on multiprocessing from Corey Schafer: https://youtu.be/fKl2JW_qrso This video helped me to run multiple automated browsers at once
* This question from StackOverflow which helped me to get the image of the seed (I used the second answer): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15018372/how-to-take-partial-screenshot-with-selenium-webdriver-in-python
* This StackOverflow question which helped lead me in the right direction for changing the zoom slider on the [ChunkBase Biome-Finder](https://www.chunkbase.com/apps/biome-finder): (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17911980/selenium-with-python-how-to-modify-an-element-css-style/17912095 
* This post from Karlo Abapo which helped me to update the slider after I had moved it to the left (I could move the square on the slider but the image wouldn't zoom out, by moving the slider a little to the left even if it couldn't go anymore in that direction it updated the zoom): https://karloabapo.wordpress.com/2018/03/18/how-to-move-a-slider-element-with-selenium-python/
* This StackOverflow post which helped teach me how to scroll to an element on a webpage so that it was in view, I needed this because the zoom wouldn't update unless I had the slider always in view. I also used it to get the seed back in view: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3401343/scroll-element-into-view-with-selenium
* This video about the Pillow library from Corey Schafer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qs3wObeWwc
* I also used the knowledge I had from the Corey Schafer video I posted in the last update about file manipulation


# Code + Stopping Progress Updates on GitHub
All of the code for this project can be found on my Github Page for it: https://github.com/CodeForeverAndEver/Good-Minecraft-Seed-Generator. In the last update, I also mentioned that I would be giving more frequent mini-updates on the Github page but have decided otherwise as it only slows my progress down.


# Coming Up Next
The next thing I am going to work on is creating an algorithm to check if the seed is ""good"". In this development process, I am only going to classify something as good if it has certain biomes near spawn. For example, I want to start by checking if it has a Mooshroom Biome, Mesa Biome, and Jungle Biome by spawn. If you want to influence this development process leave what you think is a good seed in the comments of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fmjh19/thinking_about_making_a_goodseedgenerator/). After that, I am going to take a while and learn PyQT and make a GUI to interface with the project. I also want to include different options for what you want in the seed. For example, if you want a jungle biome and mooshroom biome, there should be checkboxes in the program for whether you want them or not. But that is a much later update.


# Release Date Prediction
I think that the very first version of this should be out 1-2 weeks from now. However, this will most likely be an exe file that just looks for mooshroom, mesa, and jungle seeds with you choosing any options. The first version with a GUI I expect will take much longer and I may decide to do mini-updates for that instead of these large ones,


# Stay Up To Date
To stay up to date, keep checking the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fmjh19/thinking_about_making_a_goodseedgenerator/) where I will keep posting the links to each update! Note: This is also the same link where I am asking for what you consider to be a good seed.


# Leave Any Thoughts In The Comments
If you have any suggestions or want to show some encouragement, anything, just leave them in the comments. :D

fsid29,RoyalTeaCompany,Help with shadows in shaders,"Hi, I'm running Minecraft on Xbox and have downloaded a couple of shaders/addons and tried them one by one on my worlds.

fsi5h1,aidey1113,Future Functionality of Smithing Table,"I’m not active on this sub maybe this has already been mentioned by others.


I think what we see of the smithing table being used to make Netherite armor might be what’s the beginning of changing Minecraft’s endgame tools and armor. I think Mojang could add other resources that could be used on the smithing table (with cave update being in demand I could definitely see it). I think this where the smithing table comes in.


Diamond Armor will remain the base material but then you’d add a different resource to it for different armor and tools. Depending on which resources you choose it could give different ups and downs. Netherite could be a more defense oriented armor, while other resources might be a movement or offense based armor. The reason I think all of this is because it would make no sense for Netherite tools and armor to be the only function for this block. Or at the very least there’s something after Netherite you’d use the table for.

I've only ever played Java and I'm distinctly hazy about the details of the non-Java versions however I am aware that the controls are typically pretty annoying on mobile devices.

Obviously they could both play on iPads but my daughter would prefer to use a computer, her Android phone and an iPad in that order.  I know she could play Java on her Pixelbook but I believe that the Android app doesn't work on Chromebooks any longer.

fsh1xk,mkern1200,Need help with ImpulseSV’s villager breeder,"Hi all! So I built the villager breeder from ImpulseSV’s tutorial ([here](https://youtu.be/VTseLpa9Iyc)), with the added trap doors to prevent the farmer from getting into the beds ([about two minutes into this video](https://youtu.be/XSi8dmO7nxA)). That didn’t keep him out, so I added his own bed next to the compost bin inside the farm area.

That fixed the farmer trying to sleep in the beds beneath the breeding chamber, but now one of the villagers is breeding with the farmer, instead of the two in the chamber breeding with each other. It’s still producing baby villagers, but it’s super inefficient because they’ll only breed while the farmer is throwing them food. The second villager in the breeding chamber just stands around doing nothing.

All three villagers are sleeping in their beds and seem to be exchanging potatoes just fine, but for some reason the two in the chamber just won’t breed with each other. I’ve let it run for about a week in-game now, and it hasn’t changed. Like I said, it still produces a baby villager every once in a while, so it’s at least semi-functional, but if anyone know how to make the breeder work properly, I’d be very grateful for the help!",11,1585675396,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsh1xk/need_help_with_impulsesvs_villager_breeder/,Minecraft,2

fsgvjh,mr_zoup,Looking for multiple inventory plugin,"Im looking for a plugin that allows me to save a players inventory, wipe it when they are in a certain area, then restore it when they leave that area.

To go into further detail: I'm making a battle arena on my server. Its a survival server. so naturally players will be in survival mode. When they enter the battle-field as combatants, i want to save their inventories and empty them, so that they aren't bringing in their own food/weapons/armour. Then be able to select a pre-made kit to use during their fight. Once they either die or finish the match alive, and are teleported out of the battle-field, I want their battle-field inventory wiped (not saved, so they start fresh next time they go in) and restore their original inventory. I know there are plugins that do this if you teleport between worlds, but the arena is on the survival world.

fsey45,Bonke_117,Auto-Crafting Block,"So this block would be interesting. So you have your sugar, egg, and pumpkin farms, for pumpkin pies but you have to make the sugar and pumpkin pies manually. But now you have a block that autocrats theses items. You craft it with a crafting table in the center followed by iron and diamond blocks around the outside in a iron-diamond pattern. It drops the items immediately so you have to connect a hopper to it. The menu looks the same as the book with all the crafting recipes. The crafting block can only craft one certain item, so you would need two for your pumpkin pie farm, one for sugar and one for the pie. This block will also need a constant red stone signal to work. 

This is obviously a later game item when your focused on big builds for fun and not needing to worry about food. I purposely put a couple limitations on it because this would be way to op with out them. I kinda just came up with this off the top of my head lol but this would be a cool mod if it doesn’t get added to the game (which I doubt it will)",8,1585668631,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsey45/autocrafting_block/,Minecraft,0

I’ve had survival worlds but I never got into redstone and farming, I might have if I stuck with them, but I would get bored and play another game or just rage quit and not come back. IDK why I made a prologue xD. Anyway I’m wanting to make a sorting system, one that’s not laggy, expandable, it can require pretty much any resource, except lots of slime balls as I’m still working on a slime farm, but I don’t think they are very common in sorters.

fsdjvv,GussleCrow,Tag game for Bedrock servers (probably works in java too),"**Tag Game for Bedrock (and probably Java too)**

This is a game i designed for a realm i play on with a few friends,
Most of this probably isn't optimized as i haven't messed around with command blocks too much.
To recreate it enter the initialization commands in and then setup the command block chains in the order listed.
Hopefully this isn't too hard to follow, if you have any questions let me know and ill try to answer them.
I've also added a compass feature to it, works perfectly without it. Also works fine without the scoring, just ignore all the stuff to do with the Score objective.

*Features*
*one person is it at all times
*running into another person ""tags them""
*players can't tag back the person that tagged them
*a running scoreboard keeps track of players scores
*the person who is it gets a compass that points to the closest taggable player

**How it works:**

*main game:*
a repeating command block constantly checks if the player who is it comes within 2 blocks of someone who is both playing and can be tagged,
To keep track of these qualities people are assigned tags:
*playing: part of the game
*it: person who is currently it
*safe: someone who can be tagged 
then a process of swapping tags changes who is it and who can be tagged

*clock/scoring:*
a repeating block runs every 30 minutes
this travels down a line of chain command blocks that also have delays to trigger at certain times
at the end scores are adjusted and the person who is it is killed

*Compass:*
the world spawn is set to the closest hitable player
compasses are removed from everyone and given to the person who is it to avoid compass buildup

**Initialisation**

*sets up scoreboards:*
    /scoreboard objectives add Tag dummy Tag
    /scoreboard objectives add Score dummy Score
    /scoreboard objectives setdisplay list Tag descending
    /scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar Score descending

*first person who is it:*
    /tag &lt;player&gt; add it
    /tag &lt;player&gt; remove safe

**Command Chains**

*Registration chain*
    IMPULSE: /scoreboard players add @p Tag 0
    CHAIN: /scoreboard players add @p Score 0
    CHAIN: /tag @p add playing

I have looked everywhere and there is just nothing relating to bows anywhere. The best I found was completely useless because it was just a snip of the code used, which I can just get from minecraft's assets anyways. And before anyone says ""then why are you looking"" even if I have the code, I don't know how to make it custom data. I've tried in the past and it seems almost impossible. The best I got working was the charge up animation but the standby bow never rendered. Don't know why or how, since it should've been correct but apparently not. I did make a post before about this, and did receive the code I used to get the almost-good result, but the person stopped responding and I couldn't get an answer as to why it wouldn't work completely.

fsd52w,Ingenieur_Aleatoire,(Advice) How to get back into Minecraft (Gone since 2015),"Quick Backstory

I started playing Minecraft heavily back in the 2010 Alpha stages and quickly fell in love. At that point I was 11 years old and play continuously for the next 4 or 5 years. My friends and I all had a server together and would play together all the time. Well in 2015 we all  turned 16 and all became super busy. It was at that point that I stopped playing. The last update I remember was 1.8 but I never played that update.   Over the last 5 years I have occasionally watched some youtubers play, I am mainly into the technical farming/grinding side of things, and now that I am graduating college in a couple months I think I want to get back into playing again. I started following HermitCraft season &amp; heavily and this has pushed me to want to get back into playing. The only problem is that there is so much new stuff that I feel as if I will have to relearn the game all over again. I feel overwhelmed and this is keeping me from starting back up. Does anyone have any tips or guides that can help me get back into enjoying the  game that I was once addicted to? 

&amp;#x200B;

Played Minecraft heavily from 2010-2015, stopped playing for 5 years, now I want to get back into but am overwhelmed with all the new changes.

I have been trying to fix this issue for about 3 hours now and i'm at the point of giving up.

I have build the design of villager breeder of impulseSV and noticed there was a bug that the farmer villager could sleep in one of the beds and this would lock him out of the farm area en put him in the box with the other villagers. I looked for a fix and found that by adding a second trapdoor on the bottom of the gap to the other villagers (as shown in the picture) should fix this but as you already thought i'm here because it's not fixed... I don't now if i just did something wrong or if I am just stupid. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anyone that nows what I need to do?

one gold ingot is 1/9 of a gold block, and a full set of armor is 24 ingots and a block of gold is about 19.28 tons (19 280 kg) so its

19280 : 9 x 24 = 51410 kg

then i considered which block/item is the heaviest in the game. Of course my first tought is about the notch apple, but the crafting was removed from the game. Then i thought about the blast furnance. Its made from furnance (8 cobblestone blocks), 3 stone blocks and 5 iron ingots. That makes about 32000 kg. I thought that is pretty much the heaviest thing in game but then i thought about anvil but that is about 25000kg or sth. At the end i thought about blue ice. It is made from 9 packed ice, and the packed ice is made from 9 ice blocks each. I googled that a cubic meter of ice is about 916,7 kg, and that makes:

916,7 x 9 x 9 = 74,252 kg

then we have to count how many blue ice blocks can we fit in our inventory. It is 36 slots + 1 (left hand). We can take 37 shulker boxes, we have 27 slots in each that makes 999 slots. We can fit 64 blue ice blocks in each slot, that gives us 63,936 blocks 74,252 kg each.

63936 x 74252 = 4 747 375 872

At the end I added the armor.

4 747 375 872 + 51410 = 4 747 427 282 kg

4 747 427 282 kg is about:  
115 790 boeing 737s or  
3 500 000 ford focuses or  
almost a whole pyramid of giza or  
13 Empire state buildings or  
about 60 000 000 people or   
47 473 758 720 chocolate bars, which is about 6 bars for every human on earth

Also 4 747 427 282 kg is 10 466 285 581 pounds",4,1585657698,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsc1ku/how_much_can_steve_actually_carry/,Minecraft,1

(one of the top minecraft youtubers in 2014-16+). I was very surprised. Stampy used to have millions of views but now although he has 9mil subs his videos cant even get 500k views. I thought this was because of the abrupt ending of his lovely world series, I now have found that most of the minecraft youtubers have moved on/quit/uploaded less. Alot have quit, moved to other games or just uploaded alot less. And I am pretty sad. But what I would like to know is why because most of the minecraft youtubers I have watched have less views than subs (which normally would be the other way around) Meaning that they used to get more views and in Stampy's case, it was really significant. from like 4-10mil+ views down to 50k for most vids and 400k for Minecraft ones. But the main question is... why?",2,1585656401,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsbr7i/minecraft_youtubers/,Minecraft,1

fsbp96,TubaHorse,Poor performance on a reasonably powerful system,"No matter how many times I've updated my system, Minecraft remains the one game my system refuses to play with. Here are my current specs:

* Ryzen 7 2700 3.2 GHz base clock, not currently overclocking
* 32GB DDR4 RAM overclocked to \~2934 MHz (would be 3200 but CPU can't do that)
* MSI Tomahawk B750 motherboard
* Nvidia RTX 2070

From everything I understand, this system should be quite capable when it comes to playing Minecraft of all games. Other games I play like Warframe, BF1, the new Call of Duty that was bundled w/ the card, etc. all play around 120-144 FPS. Then in Minecraft, if I look out horizontally I get maybe 54-60 FPS. If I look down at the ground or up at the sky this shoots up to a smooth 120, but looking around horizontally makes it start chugging. I really have no clue why. I've allocated 8GB to vanilla Minecraft, and am about to try 16GB, but have never seen the RAM usage get full in the F3 menu.

fsbo4w,x13warzone,What to do for April Fools tomorrow on a minecraft server?(Need ideas),"Backstory(skippable): So I started a survival minecraft server with some friends 'cause quarantine and all, and we've played for about a week so far. There's 3 main players that play everyday(including myself) and 4 or 5 others that play every 2 days or so. We've got iron gear with a few diamonds, we have a carrot farm, zombie farm, sugar cane farm. Yesterday, we just split up to go forth from spawn to find a place for a permanent base for each of ourselves. We've started building the foundations today.

Now I'm just wondering if there's any fund pranks or activies/events I could do. Some general requirements they have to follow:

-No griefing. No lava that kills people, no tnt, no destruction of bases or foundations or personal items.

-Fun for 5ish people

-Vanilla minecraft(datapacks are allowed, just no mods)

-Doesn't take too long to setup. Anything that takes less than one hour to fully setup is fine.

fsb42v,belarskio,I really dont like the direction Minecraft is heading,"Im probably going to get a lot of hate for this but just hear me out. Most of these new updates that are scheduled for Minecraft are just gimmicks in my opinion and  just serve to bring people back for a week and leave or to appeal to small children. Dont get me wrong, I dont dislike the updates but the people who actually stick around for the game and play a lot truly dont care about the updates and the devs time would be better spent adding stuff that truly brings more to the game. The reason they are doing this is because the people who pay more are the players who come back for a short period of time because they buy skin packs and possibly new ports of the games while the people who really like the game bought all they are going to buy for the most part. Also small children buy a lot of texture packs and skin packs. The reason its so effective is because a good portion of the community just came back temporarily. Dont get me wrong I dont dislike those players I just dislike what Minecraft is doing, Goats? Termites? Pandas?(yes im aware pandas are from a while ago) Really? Examples of really good updates are Village and Pillage, aquatic, end update, Adventure update. Those updates really brought stuff to the game while these ones are mainly just things you look at once and go, hmm interesting and move on. I am certainly not insulting anyone because I am fine with temporary players, small children and people who just generally like the new updates but Im just saying my opinions.

In other words these new updates bring nothing to the game and I really dont like them except for a couple exceptions.",23,1585653295,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsb42v/i_really_dont_like_the_direction_minecraft_is/,Minecraft,1

fsa1xe,Spook319,Getting kicked off my server every 10-30 seconds," I recently bought a realm server and i'm getting kicked off every 10-30 seconds with the message ""an existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host "".

I have seen hundreds of posts with the same problem, with some providing solutions, however none have worked. You might be thinking, why am i writing yet another post on a problem that can't seem to be solved? Well, i recently found a post recommending trying to use a VPN, which i did, which worked flawlessly. That let me to think that, since it works using a VPN, there must be some more permanent solution? Maybe by changing something in router settings? I'm in no way a technical genius, hence why i'm writing in here hoping someone, who understands this stuff a bit better can explain why a VPN works, and if there is a way to change something permanently, so i won't have to use a VPN.

To those of you looking for a quick fix, i use Windscribe to play.

Here is a list of the things i have already tried - If you're just experiencing this problem, you could go through it and try your luck, however none worked for me.

Restarting my router completely.

Uninstalling minecraft

Updating / Uninstalled Java

Allowing java through my firewall

Flushed my DNS

CMD -&gt; Ipconfig /release -&gt; ipconfig /renew

Checked the website for [https://minecraftirc.net/support-articles/known-incompatible-software/](https://minecraftirc.net/support-articles/known-incompatible-software/)

\- Had none of the programs that should be causing my problem - Please note that i installed the VPN after trying to resolve it for a few days, so it cannot be the VPN causing the problem.

For reference, my internet is 100/50 - Contacted my provider twice, they can't see any problems with my connection. Did a speedtest, 97/49 so it shouldn't be a problem.

What Mojang has to say about it: This is a technical support issue, not a bug. In this case, this is caused by something blocking your connection, which can be either a program on your computer, a bad setting on your network or a problem on the server. This issue is not caused by Minecraft, and then there is nothing Mojang can do for fixing it.

I also did contact the realms support, but i highly doubt i'll get an answer. Others have tried the same and as far as i know, still no answer.",2,1585647760,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fsa1xe/getting_kicked_off_my_server_every_1030_seconds/,Minecraft,1

Anyway, I decided to sail out and I found another island village quite a far away: This one is more expansive and has lot of villagers, but the island itself seems to be smaller and there is no ravine/obvious cave entrances (from what I have seen).

So, here is the question: Should I move to the new island village with the only villager from original village? Or should I stay and try to ""import"" another villager from the new village to repopulate the town?

I have been also thinking about building a simple bridge between these two islands, but that requires a lot of materials and time as well.

fs9f20,KyokoKirigiri12,Biome Idea! The Ancient Caverns!,"Hi so uh, this may be a crap idea but who cares. I like all the Nether Updates, but what about the Underground of the Nether? 0\_0 I had this little idea in my head that I think would make Caving much more exiting in the Nether, a Cave Biome? Now the Biome would be exclusively underground, but thats doable.

This Biome would be a large Cave system made up of Basalt. Wither Skeletons spawn here, and Wither Roses can naturally generate. Above the Basalt portion, a large deposit of Soul Sand and Soil can be found.

If you mine around the Basalt and are at the correct level, you will find increased amounts of Ancient Debris. It won't be a huge change but it would be noticeable. Anyway, there's the whole shebang of the biome. Not a whole lot, but I thought it was a cool enough idea to share.

Also theres a picture of the crappy concept lol. Item Frames in the back have a Wither Rose and Ancient Debris in them.

fs9d51,AilBor,theoretical minimum achievement run (need feedback),"i started theorycrafting a minecraft achievementless run and these are the problems that i found:

**problems (unavoidable achievements)**

obtain a lava bucket (needed since obtaining obsidian and diamonds to mine it would give achievements)

obtain a blaze rod (as in 1.14 villagers don't trade ender eyes)

enter the nether (to obtain blaze rods)

enter a stronghold

enter the end

eat something (this run would already be extremely hard, it would be impossible doing it without eating)

**achievements hard to not obtain but possible**

obtain a crafting table (the entire run would be done using loot and the villager's crafting tables)

obtain cobblestone 

obtain a stone pickaxe

obtain an iron ingot (gold items could be used in the run)

enter a fortress (if you spawn there it doesn't give the achievement)

kill a mob (the entire run could be done pacifist, the ender dragon doesn't count)

kill or be killed by an entity (may be possible by finishing the ender dragon with beds/tnt)

trade with villagers (may be the best way to obtain ender pearls)

**minor roadblocks**

obtain iron armor

obtain an iron pickaxe

shoot an arrow at something",2,1585643991,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs9d51/theoretical_minimum_achievement_run_need_feedback/,Minecraft,1

fs8fb6,BinaryPirate,Advice needed!,"Pretty much a minecraft newb here but I have gotten into the game as my son rather likes it so have been playing this with him .

That said we are playing via lan just me and him on his ""main world""  which is on mc 1.9.4 where he has a nice diamond house in a village he found in a small desert area and he has put lots of work into it, I have helped him a little too.

Thing is we like mods most notably we like the xaero's minimap and world map mod very much and would like to keep using this one.  However we would like to use more mods that add more building options.

Would be great if we could use mods that added more block types and tnt types and I would very much like a mod that lets us build different ship we could actually use.

I found a mod called ""Ships Mod"" see here: https://www.planetminecraft.com/mod/beta-ships-mod---make-a-sailable-ship-out-of-blocks/

However it only seems to work with 1.7.10 and our ""main world"" doesn't seem to want to work with this mode even when I load in with mc forge 1 7 10. I even tried removing xaero's minimap and wolrd map and still crashes on start up...also I found that mc 1.7.10  does not have all the items we used in building in forge 1 9 4.

Is there mc version that will let us use a mimimap/world map like xaero's, some mod to add more building material or block types, a mod to allow us to build usable ships like Ship Mod etc etc?

Also can we have say a mod let say xaero minimap mod for example for version 1 9 4 AND also have the same mod again but for say version 1 15 2?  Or will this cause crashes since both jar would be in the same ""mod"" folder?

fs819o,dbrsd123,"Gentlemen, are mob grinders bad?","Recently I've been playing on a server with my buds and they were sad to realize that I was fish farming. Fair enough that one might be a bit OP. But then spawned the discussion. Oh boy. Simple question. Are mob grinders bad? Do they destroy the game? Personally I'd say no. There are some things in the game that simply require too much XP/ Mob drops that would not be fully functional without a mob grinder. The prime example being the gunpowder for elaytra rockets and the mending enchantment. 

It exploits a feature of the game to the players benefit. Yes. But so do the redstone logic gates that people have built. And you can not say that redstone is a broken feature. I mean just because it's a smart contraption doesnt make it bad right? Are villager spawners broken too? I mean ultimately it comes down to the game developers right? And I dont think the team has made any effort to stop things like this. It's just smart. It's not a glitch.

Home coordinates: X: 3650, Z: 331. Nice place, a desert temple I hollowed out.

Woodland Mansion location: -11038, Z: 19525

I thought it was weird that the dot on my map wasn't getting any smaller, but I didn't realize just how huge it was until I noticed my hour-so long music track had started and stopped multiple times. On the way there I ran into 4 Desert Temples, 2 Underwater Temples, 2 Pillager Lookouts, a dozen villages, 50 cooked steaks chewed through, and tens of thousands of blocks, all to make it to this mansion. Some time may have been spent looking around at shipwrecks as well.

My inventory was full of loot by the time I *got* there. I was so determined to find the stinkin' mansion, I had to quietly ignore the voice in my head reminding me there was a *return* journey too.

But anyways, if I bring a lot of pigmen into their house through the portal, and log out... when they log in, will the pigmen still be there?

Pretty much what I want to know, is will the pigmen will despawn or not by then or not?

And how does the anti xray plugin work? How does it know what texture I use for the ores? My thought was to change the texture for them so I can differentiate the fake ones from the real ones.

I don't know much about how these things work.

&amp;#x200B;

And would it be possible to bypass anti-x-ray plugins?

If there was a mod again that works in newer versions of Minecraft that could download a world from a server. And open it in single-player, and it could use the ore coordinates from that world, could that work? would it be possible?

fs73b6,thomkiedinkie,I've two problems and some questions.,"Well, I am coming back to the game after some time. And I wanted to make my gameplay more confortable, by using some mods.

I am playing version 1.15.2  
With optifine, terraforged, and a texture resource called Faithful, all current versions.  


* The first problem I am having is that when I use faithful I have no texture for the double chests, they show up like this :

[screenshot showing two double chests without textures](https://preview.redd.it/pwqs6qg0zxp41.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1c09c4fae4298544d21ec1362f7c4afe287af75)

I have checked the texture for the chest in the texture resource folder and it is there, so I don't really know what is the problem.

Still about the chests, but this problem now also happens with the normal single chest is a glitch in the texture where the chest lid touches the lower part. I can confirm that this was happening even with the default texture pack.

* The second problem I am having is that whenever I load my game I am forced to lower my chunk render distance to something like 10 or less - I usually play on 48 -; If I don't do this the world loads as a vast open space with nothing loaded other than the player. After the load is complete I am able to turn it back to 48 without no problems. The game is completely playable with this problem, but I'd like to get rid of this annoyance if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my questions are:

* After a power outage in my house, I went back to the game and my horse - which I was riding - had disappeared. I know something like this happens as it has happened with me before. It in fact becomes invisible - I think -, is there any way to get it back? The last time it happened the horse was on a leash and I was on a boat, it disappeared and I don't remember what I did to make it reappear back.
* Is there a way to extend the render distance past 48?",1,1585632207,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs73b6/ive_two_problems_and_some_questions/,Minecraft,1

fs5y60,BeyondElectricDreams,"Progression, farms, and endgame: A way to fold farming into the base game experience while adding more mining to minecraft","I've been thinking a lot about interactions with the community I've had lately, several from people quite hostile to the idea of making mob farms (specifically, farms like iron and gold ones) and the common complaint was that they required utilizing game rules in obscure ways to create the farms in question. 

I, personally, find that to be part of the fun of minecraft in the first place - bending the game to my will to create factories that produce the resources I require without needing constant input. It lets me focus on other things while still generating necessary resources. 

But on the other hand, I can see why people would prefer a solution that was ""baked in"" to the main game. And so I thought of an idea that would help make the concept of factories and farming more a part of the base game. 

The idea? Add new resources in The End that allow you to make special blocks - machines that will convert certain items into others, with a feed similar to a hopper, and a timer similar to a furnace, but with no fuel required. 

Let's call these new resources Ender Jewels. You can have a variety of ender jewels, with different ones required for different machines, and better machines requiring more of the rarer gems.

For simplicity sake, let's say there's Blue, Purple, and Yellow, with blue being the most common, and yellow the rarest. 

Maybe, to make an iron machine block, you'd require a purple and two yellows. Maybe for gold, four yellows. 

The idea here is to allow the creation of these resources but to have a firm, end-game cost associated with it. It would additionally give a reason to go to the end, and larger farms would of course require more farming and more jewels. 

You would now need to make a TNT cobblestone machine to feed your machines, which would then spit out iron. But here's the beauty - the rate of gain can be tuned on a per-machine basis, meaning if you want a glorious iron farm producing double chests full of the stuff, GREAT! - you'll need to farm up tons upon tons of purple and yellow gems to make the tons of iron machines you'll need, but that adds an endgame farming cost associated with the production of these sorts of farms.

It also firmly plants these farms in endgame territory, preventing a player on a new world from immediately procuring unlimited iron.

This ""machine"" concept could be used to create any and all block types that are otherwise nonrenewable - it could even create a solution for the TNT duplication droppers that are relied on for large scale farms. Simply make a TNT machine using Ender Jewels and place it inside your factory. Boom, done. Still need to time it with redstone, but the supply issue is sorted out. If the machine fires too fast for one tnt machine, add two or three to keep pace with the machine's demands. 

These ender jewels could have another use, too - a progression system above and beyond Netherite as we know it now. Make the jewels give a special property to armor when applied, but you can only apply one gem per slot. Maybe yellow is night vision. Maybe blue is leaping. you get the idea - it would add further progression to armor without adding a whole new tier above Netherite. 


Anyway, what do you guys think? I think it would be a great way to have your cake and eat it too - it keeps farms in the game, while incorporating them into progression systems. Heck, if they make the blocks require redstone input, and/or spit the resources out, it would require entire farm designs for them. It could be great fun.",5,1585627066,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs5y60/progression_farms_and_endgame_a_way_to_fold/,Minecraft,1

fs57l6,Th3Rush22,Block Pallet suggestion for Death Star themed survival world,"So I have FINALLY found some sort of inspiration for playing Minecraft. I enjoy the technical aspect but my worlds have always fizzled out after I hit endgame because I dont have a real inspiration or drive to change the world I have created.

This time I am trying to change that. I have always used a Stormtrooper skin and so inspiration struck me. Each of my bases will be themed with a Star Wars planet in mind. My swamp base will be dagobah, I can make a desert village like Mos Eisley. My Nether base will look like Mustafar (possibly with Vaders castle), I can make a Hoth base, an Endor Base, Mas Kanatas castle, etc... all with a purpose. Are not simply decorations but functional farms and such with a specific builed theme in mind. 

The Grand Central Main Base of my world is going to be the Death Star. I am going to build everything I need in the sky and then skin it in a giant globe and make it look like the Death Star. 

My problem is that I have never been a good builder and dont know what blocks to use, lol. Specifically for the Death Star bits as that is what I am starting right now. It’s a lot of grey, but I dont know that stone is the correct choice. Plus I feel like there should also maybe be some black and white too. I am just looking for some block suggestions so let me know what you guys think.

tldr: what blocks should I use for my builds to look like they could be found in the Death Star?",1,1585623931,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs57l6/block_pallet_suggestion_for_death_star_themed/,Minecraft,1

fs4vwk,Hans_Undertrench,What is the point of beetroot,"Like seriously, I cannot find any aspect in which I would genuinely use beets in Minecraft.

-For food: A single beet restores 1 hunger bar. A beetroot soup restores 3. Beetroot soup is literally useless since you can’t stack it, and there are way better alternatives such as cooked food.

-For breeding and/or harvesting: Just use carrots or potatoes, they’re as easy to obtain as beets, if not easier. Plus, each harvest grants you around 1-3 each in comparison to beets which only grant you 1 and you need to have separate seeds to plant them.

-For dyes: That could be the “best” possible use, but poppies and rose bushes are fairly common. 

-Unless you are in a huge need for red dye for some project, or literally have no other food source, I cannot find any use for beets.

-I think that beets should be buffed in some way or another, perhaps they could be used in brewing to create some sort of new potion.

-In general, the food variety in Minecraft is pretty decent, but for the late game, everyone just goes with cooked steak and most of the other options go basically obsolete.

If we had a sawmill bloom that shared the same function as a stonecutter, it would be more convenient. Also, this block could serve as a workstation for a Woodworker villager. 

Novice-

Trade 1-16 random logs(excluding nether    logs)=1 emerald

Trade 2- 2 emeralds=three saplings. Random sapling type excluding nether trees.

Apprentice-

Trade 3- 28 sticks=1 emerald

Trade 4- 1 emerald=48 planks. Random plank type to be given, no nether planks.

Journeyman-

Trade 5- 16 leaves=1 emerald. Random leave type to be accepted.

Trade 6- 1 emerald=9 bonemeal. Iffy on this one, thought maybe as a fertilizer for trees.

Expert-

Trade 7- 3 apples=1 emerald.

Trade 8-2 emeralds=9 chests.

Master-

Trade 9- Need a suggestion. Could not think of one.

Trade 10- 7 emeralds=Diamond Axe with 1 level 2 enchantment.

So I'm on android and I can't connect to my friend who's on switch. We've tried changing our skins, making the world invite only but nothing works. The loading screen just doesn't end.

However the weird thing is that we can both connect to our other friend who's also on android. Dunno what settings she has but this is how me and my friend can play. But we have no clue why we can't connect to eachother. 

We're using P2P and not realms btw.

I wanted to build a fairly large base cut out from the inside, but discovered after laying down the outline that the mountain really wasn't that deep. 

Logically, rather than move to a larger natural formation while I was ahead, I decided to spend much longer expanding the existing terrain. I made a temporary switch to creative and use World Editor to copy, paste, and fill terrain. It doesn't look exactly like spawned terrain, but it's close enough for my uses.

fs1z00,codonnell35,Thinking about starting a realm.,"Hello all!

I'm considering starting up a realm (JAVA) Although, I have no trustworthy friends that worn grief/steal etc. If be looking for the players on the realm to be just as good of friends in game and out of game (eg, friends enough to add on Facebook or whatever it play other servers together etc)

I have a strange satisfaction with the way the hermit-craft server works and I would like to base my realm on that as much as possible. For example, having the members be very active. Having the members be friends enough to colab on projects etc too. As well as having a shopping district that we can use in the same way they do (exchange diamonds for goods). Although, that's why ALL the members have to be trustworthy to ensure that no one grief's the shops or other builds generally and to ensure that no one will steal goods/diamonds from the cheers in the shopping district too. 

I am considering using the hermit-craft season 7 seed as it has almost every common biome near spawn so everyone can live relatively close to one another and overall have a better community and experience. I may try to alter the current map to add some extra dungeons and more exploration activities that we could do too. I am, also, a fan of command blocks and would probs add some of them so that, for example: one player sleeping works on the server. Although, it will be totally vanilla. 

I am an 18 year old male from Scotland UK. And I would be looking for the members despite being trust worthy to also be familiar with the time zone so that there's more opportunities to all play at the same time. I would like the members to me mature too (no cry babies or spammers etc etc), that doesn't nessessarily mean ""old"" either. I know a very mature talented 14 year old player too. You would not have to be good at the game (allows more opportunities for colabs if, for example you are bad at pve so can't defeat the wither boss) although it would be great if you had some experience with the game and know how it works etc.

All this is an idea, please, if you'd be interested leave a comment if enough respond I'll happily make the realm ☺️

Torches only react to two tick pulses. Pistons spit out their blocks when 1-tick:ed, which makes them behave erratically. Comparators need 2 ticks to process values. Observers need something else to invert them AFAIK. 

I've even tried to build a machine that closes trapdoors to funnel dispensed items to different hoppers, and one that uses one set of pistons to block another set of pistons with observers to detect which ones couldn't extend (though trapdoors in general might have some merit still)

I had only been doing it for like 5 minutes when my friends buddy (the owner) came down and told me to stop x-raying. I mean it was pretty obvious I was, but out of fear of getting banned from the realm I played dumb. He told me he has something that sends him notifications when people use hacks on the realm, and then proceeded to ban me. I deserve the ban so theres no point in going and trying to ""prove"" I didn't, but it just made me curious. Is there even such a thing as this??

fs08ve,PresidentCabbage,Orc settlements,"This idea is about adding another mob that can trade (orcs) and it could be the gateway to add much more.

Features this could add:
New biome- redwood forest (with new tree)
New mobs- orcs (with variants), deer, and bears (black and brown)
New weapons- spears, hammers, battle axes
New items- amethyst (new ore), pelts, animal heads, spiked barricades (from Minecraft dungeons)
New structures- orc settlements (villages)-watchtower and a few houses all in the settlement and a blacksmith also in the settlement 

Orcs Variants:
(Can trade with orcs using amethyst)

The guard: a type of orc that can spawn with a spear and some armor also has a chance to spawn with a bow if it spawns in a watchtower (will be a part of the settlement) it can not be traded with

Blacksmith: can be traded/barded with, it can sell/buy the new weapons (spears hammers and battle axes) that’s how you get them otherwise  they are non craft-able

Hunter: can be traded/barded with, this one will sell/buy pelts (bear, deer, wolf, fox) and animal heads (bear, deer, wolf, fox, and pig)

Trading/ bartering:
Since they added bartering with the piglins I think this is how they can make it more refined with the orcs (this idea does not apply to piglins). You would right click an orc with amethyst then it would make 1 grunt sound meaning it wants more so you would give him another then it would make 2 grunt sounds meaning it’s ready to make a deal (you can give it more to get better stuff later on) so then it would cycle threw the items it has to trade with, then you would right click it again to pick the item it is holding so it will throw it to you. They barter like this with strangers so you would be able to properly trade with them once they trust you. The way you can tell they trust you is similar to the villager badges. They start out at level one with one pelt around their waist you barter with them to get to level two then they would have a pelt around their waist and a new pelt over one shoulder it is not until level three where they would have pelts over both shoulders and one around their waist that they trust you and will now trade with you (with a UI). 

Amethyst:
The new ore that you would use to trade with orcs. It would be more common than diamond but less common than iron and gold. 

Pelts and animal heads:
The charged creeper thing would not affect the animals that would only work for the mob heads that we have now. The way you would get animal heads and pelts is trading/bartering with the orcs or killing the mobs with a battle axe (has a small chance to drop). The animals you can get pelts from are bears (black and brown), deer, wolfs, and foxes. The animals you can get the heads from are bears(black and brown), deer, wolfs, foxes, pigs, and hoglins (you can sell hoglin heads for a lot of amethyst with the orcs because they have never seen them before). 
Also pelts can be placed on the ground like a bed and if they are big enough like the bear and deer ones you can sleep on them but it would not reset your spawn-point it will only skip the night. 

Orc settlements:
They can spawn in Tyga, redwood forest, and spruce forest because that’s where the animals that they like to hunt spawn (bears and deer and other).
The settlement would spawn with a barrier of spiked barriers like the ones in Minecraft dungeons and the guards would be out front you would have to pay at least one of them with amethyst (one amethyst should be enough) to get in. The orcs would live in houses and sleep on pelts and what would register a place as an orc settlement is spiked barriers orcs and placed pelts. If you break their pelts or their barriers they will try to kill you and if you hit them they will try to kill you so don’t mess with them.

Also as an idea maybe the orcs and the illagers don’t get along. This doesn’t mean they like villagers either but they have enough to deal with so the orcs won’t do anything to them because they are peaceful (and to an orc that’s boring). 

But all of this is a suggestion I just think that it would make a very good addition to the game. Especially pelts how cool would it be to have a mobile bed that doesn’t reset your spawn.",1,1585605585,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs08ve/orc_settlements/,Minecraft,1

fs04kk,GucciDaddy,Corrupted worlds and seeds,"So for whatever reason my minecraft save has been corrupted three times now within a relativley short period of time. Playing on OptiFine 1.14.4, not sure if this is a common issue.

As per the guides online I made a new world and copied it's level.dat file over the corrupted file in my original world. This worked fine. However, I've done this three times now with different seeds, as I was not aware that the level.dat file also included the seed (sort of new to this). 

Does this mean that my world, apart from the already explored segments, is a complete mess consisting of 4 different seeds?

I've already seen some wierdly loaded chunks near my base. Is there any way of reverting this? I actually have a screenshot of my original seed if that helps. Not sure how damaging this is for the overall experience when exploring later on in the game.

Would be grateful for any advice!",2,1585605201,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fs04kk/corrupted_worlds_and_seeds/,Minecraft,1

This is my first post so sorry if it is the wrong format or breaking any rules. 

My kids love playing Minecraft on LAN sharing worlds and going on adventures. 

Now sometimes in this COVID lockdown they also want to play against/with classmates using their Microsoft accounts. They are set up as children in my family. 

Now, when they are logged on using their Microsoft accounts they cannot see each other in LAN view. 

I have given them an Xbox one log-on add added each kid as a friend, but still no LAN games are visible. 

Does anyone know what I am doing wrong? 
Oh yeah and the kicker - to host a server to play with classmates - they need to be signed in.

But the internet was working normally on all devices after that. I considered it being because Java was outdated, but I downloaded the game on a completely different computer and I still have the same problem. I also turned off the firewalls. Still nothing.

Other servers work perfectly fine, I'm just having issues with the Aternos one. My friends are playing in it normally -- it seems I'm the only one with issues. It's a cracked server -- I use the premium launcher though -- and it has the SkinsRestorer plug-in.

That's why the credits role when you kill the dragon and go through the portal. If you build stuff in survival you are wasting your time. That is why they have creative mode. Survival is for SURVIVING. Creative is for CREATING. Do not mix these two up! and another thing, minecraft is always updating, so when the new update comes out your world gets corrupted with the new changes. Making all old worlds broken. Like when the Nether was updated just recently it BROKE all the worlds that had a nether already. And if you are REALLY trying to do survival why do you cheat to give urself items? That is literally even cringier than trying to have a long term survival world. The thought that people even put ""hard work"" into making their survival worlds last forever is stupid.

This might be the wrong place for this but idk🤷🏻‍♂️

I was wondering if someone could help me 

Me and a few friends are looking to play minecraft windows 10 edition together with a few players on Xbox and a few on Pc. 

Is it possible to create a survival game mode server that is open 24/7 (willing to pay) and if so could someone instruct me how to send to a place that can tell me? 

This could be a really obvious thing but I’m new to all this so I have no clue. 

For simplistic sake this is a brief run done-

A survival game 
Open 24/7 even without the host 
For Windows 10 edition (so both Xbox and pc can play together)

frxuig,xXN3MOWENXx,There Should Be Lizards In Minecraft,"There should be lizards in minecraft, they would spawn in caves and when you kill them you can get a lizard tail. The tails should be able to be made into swords, it would be as good as diamond. The extra part would be the sword can regrow over time like lizard tails or mending, but instead of xp mending, it will mend when you sleep and your hunger is full because that's when your own body can heal. To keep it from being overkill, maybe it only mends 20% durability every time you sleep with full hunger to keep from over mending as you can only sleep every 10 minutes. In addition you might need multiple tails to make it since the tails would be small as lizards are to. But maybe the lizards would be big like spiders and then you would only need one but they would just be hard to get. (Edit) Reading the only comment I had I noticed that when you have something that makes tools it doesn't just make a sword or just the armor it takes everything so, what makes these stand out is that they fix themself if you sleep. Depending on you hunger status and what tools your using it fill fix them a different amount. This would be useful when you mining if you have a underground base where you want to conserve your wood. Since Mending is very hard to get you can use these tools/weapons. If you underground and have limited wood you don't want to need to be making new tools because you would need the wood for other things to. So if you have these lizard tools just like lizard tails they will slowly heal them self, but to keep from over use and making it overpowered you just limit what it can do. Like gold it was a perk but it also has bad things, it's very fast but it breaks quicker, so for this it heals itself but only a certain amount. I hope someone from minecraft sees this as this would make a whole new part of minecraft letting people live underground for longer periods of times as they wont run out of wood making new tools. Underground is a very underrated part of minecraft. Above ground you have villages, pillager outposts, desert temples and the ocean. But underground all you have is caves and mineshafts, i really hope this makes it into minecraft as it will completely change minecraft gameplay as you would be able to stay underground for longer periods of time. Not needing to go above ground to get wood, and hopefully other things will be added to.

[I designed this to match the existing swords as much as possible with the dark bottom and lighter top. I decided to as texture and some colors that pop out more so that it seems more lifelike and natural like a lizard tail. The one part i dont like is the bottom gem thing it looks to clean for this. But I not only added texture to this because its a lizard tail but also to match the new textures that are coming in to minecraft you can see what i mean by comparing the old diamond stuff to the new netherite.](https://preview.redd.it/vx0tn4td6vp41.png?width=659&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=054008b5adf09b0e1ac09414b7a2b022d0b99d64)",1,1585597867,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frxuig/there_should_be_lizards_in_minecraft/,Minecraft,1

frxh26,DeadendEndeavor,Armor against Creepers on hard is broken and it's the reason why hardcore always ends with unfair deaths. Testing done.,"Did some testing. 

**Diamond armor reduces damage by 80% from:**

Players on all difficulties

Zombies on all difficulties

TNT on all difficulties

Creepers on easy and normal






**Against Creepers on hard... it provides less than 16% damage reduction. (can't get exact number because it one-shots though full diamond, but even a few layers of protection enchantments don't save you so I'm guessing it's less than 10% damage reduction) **

Just creepers, and just on hard. 

Not creepers on all difficulties. 

Not all mobs on hard. 

Not explosions. 

**Just creepers, and just on hard.**





And yes, this applies to all armor as well, just a higher degree of less effectiveness.

Why? And how has no one called this out before?

It's the reason creepers on hardcore are near impossible to counter (as they **OH SO OFTEN DROP DOWN AND EXPLODE POINT BLANK WITH NO WARNING**) . And it makes no sense why they alone should have this immunity to armor defense and only on hard.

So until you can get full enchanted high level protection (or a mix of medium level protection and blast protection) diamond armor, surprise creepers will end your hardcore run because **the damage reduction of armor is BROKEN against just creepers and just in hard mode.**

TLDR: if armor followed to rules of how armor should work in all cases, you should be able to survive suprise creepers if you're well equipt with full armor. And that is something that is needed in hardcore.",13,1585596702,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frxh26/armor_against_creepers_on_hard_is_broken_and_its/,Minecraft,1

frxe2a,untilweslaughteryou,Help with nether hub linking [1.15.2],"So I've successfully linked the portal in my base to the portal I've set up on the nether roof for future hub/fast travel network.

However, I still want a portal from my overworld (somewhere close to the base ideally) to link to my old portal on the nether ground (set up a base blaze farm, honestly sick nether spawn with two fortresses closeby and a nice flat area) 

So far, attempts have not been able to separate the two - I want the base portal to go to the nether roof and the portal I've set up 20+ blocks away from my base to go to my old nether base. 

If it matters, the portal in my base is at y=6 and the one outside is on the ground, so 60s. I've put the portals in the nether at the exact coordinates /8 and rounded, but can't seem to separate the two linking sets of portals.

What am I doing wrong? Do they need to be WAY farther away in my overworld? Did I screw myself making my portals at bedrock level in the overworld? Can't seem to figure this one out.",3,1585596437,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frxe2a/help_with_nether_hub_linking_1152/,Minecraft,1

I'm building a glass tunnel at the bottom of a river, that will eventually have a rail cart running through it. I thought with the way water works that as soon as I seal the whole thing, the water inside will disappear. I'm not done building it yet, but I sealed it up to test it, and it's still full of water. There aren't even any air pockets. The tunnel starts in the ground and the water is flooding into there and eventually just slopes off into nothing. Do I have to stand at that end and bail it all out with buckets, or is there a better way?",5,1585594287,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frwocw/beginner_here_trying_to_figure_out_how_to_unflood/,Minecraft,1

frvwa3,Spanky2k,Any tips for optimising my server?,"I've been running a Minecraft server for some friends for the last couple of weeks (first time I've really played Minecraft). There are up to about 6 people on at any one time. Some people have built some redstone contraptions, we've all built our own houses etc. I'm running Minecraft Forge but the only server mod right now is Terraforged. I'm getting a lot of ""Can't keep up! Is the server overloaded?"" messages and at times, I've seen the RAM usage almost get to 8GB, the amount the server currently has allocated. With 2 people on, it peaks at about 6GB. I originally had 2 CPU cores dedicated to it but increased it to 4 last week. I plan to up the RAM to 16GB later today but I thought I'd ask to see if anyone has any other suggestions on how to optimise things.

I've heard about pre-generated chunks helping. Any ideas how I can do that? Any other suggestions?

fru70w,DakotaTheAxe,I hate Minecraft PvP,"I hate Minecraft PvP. It is by far the worst part of the game. Servers like Mineplex and Hypixel have so many games dedicated to it, and it is sold as a very fun experience. However, whenever i join a game like Skywars, for example, all it is is 12 tryhards circlejerking in a corner with speed bridging and combos. Its not fun. Its boring. Its frustrating. And would you believe that this is only an introduction?

Combos: They're dumb. Like, really dumb. Yes, if you master them they're good and blah blah blah. The part I hate about combos is the part where you cant get out of them. Its dumb. On your screen, they'll be hitting you from 5 blocks away. Its so stupid. Combos are inherently flawed, just by the fact that they're so hard to get out of. 

Also, more on the topic of the tryhards looking like they're hitting you from a mile away, why? Why does it look like that? It would be such a simple fix. Just change the camera view to your hitbox. That would be such a simple solution.

Another aspect that I hate is the sheer amount of toxicity. I went into 20 Skywars servers and asked the question: ""Why, whenever I get put into a combo, it looks like they're hitting me from 5 blocks away?"".  in 13 of the 20 servers, at least one person said something along the lines of: ""You're just bad at the game."" That's absolutely ridiculous. Maybe Skywars players are like that. I dont know. Also, of the 7 remaining servers, not 1 person answered. It was just empty in chat. Nobody spoke. Out of 20 servers, nobody answered my question.

And Minecraft PvP tryhards, feel freen to downvote. I don't care. Just, if you downvote, at least tell me why in the comments. Don't downvote just because ""Oh, this guy hates Minecraft PvP, let's hate on him!"". Don't do that.",10,1585586446,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/fru70w/i_hate_minecraft_pvp/,Minecraft,1

fru2c2,Naxreus,Suggestion for 1.16: doNightSkip gamerule.,"Hello, im planing on making a serious roleplay realm and we are looking into some realistic gameplay, for that we need to be able to disable night skipping on beds but keeping the rest of bed functions like laying down and setting spawnpoints.

Basically a way to get this working is to have some acount always in creative AFK so the night cant be skiped even when the rest of players got to their beds.

Having always an active AFK acount on the server preventing everyone from skipping the night is not optimal, this could be solved with a simple gamerule that we currently dont have and seems like there is no plugins for the last versions to solve this.

Would be great if the mojang team reads this and help us with that simple gamerule. Many players that like challenges or want to get a more difficult experience may like this suggestion.

frskmf,LimeGNinja,Requesting help with using Minecraft for Teletherapy with Children,"Hello, I'm a mental health counselor for children and during these strange times I'm having to provide therapeutic services virtually through video chat. I had an old copy of Minecraft that I revived and claimed my Win 10 version of in hopes of being able to better engage with my kids by either joining their games or be able to invite them to my own. However as a mental health professional I'm concerned about not only the logistics of joining and inviting my clients to games but from what it seems like I need to add my clients to my friends list (and they would need to add me to theirs?) which could create an issue with confidentiality if my friends are allowed to see who is on my friends list. I've gone into my xbox profile and set all privacy settings to BLOCK except for the ""others can communicate with voice, text, or invites"" option in hopes that will do the trick?

I'd appreciate if someone here could explain how joining/inviting others to games works (and if there's any considerations that I need to take into account with inviting/joining someone that's playing on a different platform) as well as if I have my profile set up to be entirely private so that even friends aren't able to view my friends list or see my history of players games I've joined.

frrugy,petrosxo,Instructions on how to turn an online hardcore server into a survival one.,"*(I'm just posting this because I found no information available online on how to do this)*

# Step One:

* Download your Minecraft world file. (The way you do that changes based on the host of the server. For example, if your host is aternos [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MJwmylv3sI&amp;ab_channel=Aternos) is how you do it.)

# Step Two:

* After you are sure that you have downloaded the world files and that they are safe, delete the current world from your server and create a new, survival, one. (Again, the way you do this can vary based on your host, in aternos, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9ea-5WL01M&amp;ab_channel=Aternos) is how you do it.)
* Make sure that the new world has every setting you want it to have (It is not hardcore etc.)

# Step Three:

* Download the new, survival, world.

&amp;#x200B;

(***Note:*** *Before step four I would make a backup file just to be sure that nothing goes wrong.)*

# Step Four:

* Replace the level.dat file from your old world with the level.dat file from the new one.

# Step Five:

* Upload your old world with the new level.dat file to your host.",2,1585578751,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frrugy/instructions_on_how_to_turn_an_online_hardcore/,Minecraft,1

He leaves his character logged in to keep an xp farm active and running overnight and this morning he logged in to find he died in lava (his spawn area was under lava)  


Someone logged into the server we don't know, and ran around basically blowing up anything they could find with spare TnT we had in a chest, they made an effort to go to each chest and smash them, then blow holes in most of the structures we had built.  


it's almost all recoverable but it's senseless vandalism that destroyed hours of work.

frpge7,technitaur,Which is easier on the CPU for continuously transporting items upwards: Hopper Minecarts or a Dropper Elevator?,"One of my favorite pasttimes in the game is to create an infinite chicken generator (or Poultry Infinium, as I like to call it).

I've come up with a number of designs. The two best designs are both very successful, and they also use a sorting system to separate the eggs, feathers and meat. One design uses a chest minecart running continuously around a rail to collect and deposit items between hoppers/chests, and the other uses a dropper elevator. All designs use dispensers to constantly crack collected eggs against a wall to spawn more chickens into the 'engine room' for me to breed, kill and cook for xp.

The chickens are all kept in the same area, and that floor is made of hoppers. As the number of chickens approaches 900, I get out my sword and cull them down to about 300-400 to keep the game from lagging too much.

I want to tighten and improve the design further but I'm not sure, from a CPU standpoint, which is the more efficient approach.

Bearing in mind that there will always be at least 300 chickens in the vicinity to ensure lots and lots of eggs always being produced, does anyone know the game code well enough to recommend one method over the other? I think my minecart method involved two or three minecarts, and the dropper elevator employed around a dozen droppers to get the job done.

I want to minimize redstone-related lag as much as possible, because as the number of chickens approaches 1000, the world starts to get extremely laggy, and I'm not really sure how much of this might be induced by the redstone components.

Any advice you guys might have for reducing entity lag would be great, as well. I've tried doubling and even quadrupling the memory allocation to the game, but there was virtually no change in how many chickens can be in there at once before the game lags.",0,1585569430,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frpge7/which_is_easier_on_the_cpu_for_continuously/,Minecraft,1

Underground makes for mega lava and water pits, and unreachable ledges with everything in your way from shooting, bedrocks wither also has this op charge attack which drops every block in the universe making you lag tf out.

Believe me, there is nothing left after I got the TNT out. my question is how many portals does Xbox one bedrock have? and where should I try and look? I found one north and the other one south (1400+ blocks away). thanks for any help or suggestions. 

playing on Xbox one world download in case anyone is interested. -1949016968

first one from spawn will take you to it the 2nd one that I found is at 149-38-1428 (library) 

I made my main base practically at spawn.

I was quite mad but pulled myself together and me in my friend (cause I did that in a multi server that me.and my friend have) and yesterday got everything back. I grinded like crazy. I got a sick spawn in one of the portals after lilling the dragon again and got spawned near an end city with an Elytra. I got it, I got some shulker shells and went to the emderman farm to get some levels. I got them, put the last enchants I needed - Unbreking III and Mending on my Elytra. I was back in business. Or so I thought. I put down my Ender chest do reorganize some stuff. When I was ready I mined it and right at that moment there was a tiny bit of lag that was enough to make me mine the block right beneath my feet. And right there, at that moment I felt how my super happy face that aas because of the amazing End City spawn and lucky enchants I got, just dissappeared in seconds. I didn't have time to put on the Elytra nor get the rockets. Once again, I lost all the progress which I just acquired in a matter of seconds. And today I am taking a day off of Minecraft. Cause boy I was tired of grinding and need some rest. But hopefully on tuesday I get back stringer and get all the stuff back... again.

frmbqe,YeojIsCool,My suggestion/opinion about netherite,"Personally I believe that a meta change in minecraft was very necessary to keep the game from becoming stale, however I don't believe \*just\* adding the new ore was the way to do it. I believe that if you keep just adding new ores its just going to cycle the same feelings from getting diamonds to getting netherite. I believe that netherite should be in the game but it should have a twist.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing to consider is incentive, If you make the netherite tools/armor a minuscule upgrade from diamond, there will be no willingness to get them. So I do believe they need to have some actual power to keep their value.  


I also believe that diamond shouldn't be straight useless once you have a complete netherite set with all the enchantments and stuff like that because it is still the rarest ore in the over world, so it should keep some incentive as well.  


The way I would solve this problem is to make it so that netherite armor is much better than diamond, like it is now, but make it so you can not put mending on it. This would make it so you have to keep up with the armor and eventually get new armor. Once the armor breaks it goes back to being Diamond armor which then can be upgraded again.  


I would have this same suggestion with tools but also possibly give them special features such as auto-smelt for the pickaxe, or being able to shoot short fire shots out of the sword. I think these upgraded tools would create an incentive to use them, and would give them the power over diamond that the meta needs.  


Please tell me what you think about my idea :D",4,1585553135,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/frmbqe/my_suggestionopinion_about_netherite/,Minecraft,1

Also another one that has been on my mind is mc 1.9 beta pre release 2 I think.  This one included potions being made by simply using a cauldron only. (At least that is what I have seen on YouTube).   So a player would simply toss something into it while it has water and it would create a potion.

frlxzf,Cr4zydood,I've Had Enough with Our Save Data Going Missing,"My best friend play Minecraft on Xbox, not Xbox One Editikn. We keep losing our data on our worlds, seemingly at random. It's not a corruption where the world is gone, it just syncs the world and then BOOM! Hours, days, and weeks of progress gone. It's happened three times. Twice to one world, and so bad the second time that we had begun a new world! This new one has now experienced the same issue today and I'd estimate about 15-20 hours lost.

We've tried everything we feel that's in our power. We play online, and we've tried playing the world on mine and his Xbox, with no dice on either end. We've deleted console save data, restarted the game app, deleted/reinstalled, restarted the Xbox, hard reset the Xbox, and nothing. I fear the problem may be something with these updates that are rolling out, as maybe loading the world on an outdated version COULD lead to progress loss.

Let me formally say I have no idea what's going on. And nobody online seems to know either. I'm not much of a Reddit poster but this issue is a big problem that REALLY lowers all of our esteem to even play the game at all. And we were just beginning to get a ton of people onto the world.

THE PROBLEM I've noted is that you'll load up Minecraft, go past the new update info, blah blah, and then the world's thumbnail will be black and white. Load it in and then you seem to have irriversibly lost a gut-punching amount of progress. Is there any hope for our lost progress?  I spent the whole spring break dedicated to this world... And I just got my elytra too!

We're mildly infuriated and we feel like there's no point in recovering the hard way if it'll just toss progress in the trash again....

frlcp4,DanRileyCG,How to Set '/Clear' Minimum + Fast Sell System (Minecraft Bedrock),"Hey guys,

[**Here's a quick demo of the system in action!**](https://youtu.be/Ep9ODGw2TFo)

[**Video of full system**](https://youtu.be/f7L_IKUqRvI)

These systems were designed for Bedrock (but they may work with Java too, I don't play Java these days so I wouldn't know). I don't think there's any reason that they wouldn't work for Java. So long as the systems are in a ticking area both systems can be activated and then will continue to function properly even if the player using them leaves the area. They will still properly target the player who activated the systems.

This IS my first Minecraft related video on YouTube-- and yes, I know, it's perhaps too long for some. My apologies. My thought process was that there will be people watching with all ranges of command skill and I really wanted the viewer to understand how and why the system works, rather than just going from block to block and show the commands without context. If you understand how and why it works in conjunction with the commands you're far more likely to succeed while building it and building other advanced systems of your own in the future! If you found this helpful please like and subscribe! :D

# Set /Clear Minimum System:

This system is the only way that we can impose a /clear minimum on the player--or more simply this is the only way that we can make sure that a player has enough items to either sell or buy into a system.

* This systems were designed for both buying and selling.
* This system is very smart and won't target the wrong player.
* This system was design specifically for realms and servers (but is fine offline).
* This system will continue to work flawlessly even if the player using it disconnects mid use.
* 1 variable controls the item count that you're testing for so it's very easy to modify it.
* This system counts as fast as possible (unless functions can double tick) at 20 items a second.
* The system will never cheat the player and the player can never cheat the system.

#  Fast Sell System:

This system will sell the specified currency item into your currency system as fast as command blocks will allow (20 items sold per second).

* This system sells items as fast as possible (unless functions can double tick) at 20 items a second.
* This system is very smart and won't target the wrong player.
* It's very easy to adjust the value that an item is worth or which item is being sold.
* This system was design specifically for realms and servers (but is fine offline).
* This system will continue to work flawlessly even if the player using it disconnects mid use.
* This system will always accurately give the players the correct money for the number of  items that they have on them (it won't cheat them).

Lemme start at the beginning. The first time I was exposed to Minecraft was in early 2011. I had received my first internet-enabled electronic (an itouch) for my 11th birthday, and I rapidly discovered youtube. Like most other kids, I eventually stumbled across a minecraft video and was absolutely transfixed. I spent hours watching let's plays, hunger games, mod reviews and the like. Like many other preteens at the time, I believe part of the joy of watching these people play minecraft and share their experiences was the feeling of connection it could bring. I was not the most gregarious kid, and I generally only kept to my younger brother (age 7-ish) and a couple close friends. 

After a year or two, I successfully badgered my parents into downloading pocket edition on the family ipad (my old itouch could not support it). My (now 2) brothers and I would spend hours taking turns playing it. Sure, it was very limited compared to what the pc and consoles had in terms of features, but all that mattered to me and my brothers was that it was Minecraft, and we could just build whatever we wanted.

One day, the older of my younger brothers saved up for a kindle fire, and we began playing on LAN in a 256x256 survival world. We never built anything too grand or too special. We had one main house, a two story wood house. It was built on top of a hill, and there was absolutely nothing special about it. But that didn't matter to us. It was our house and we could do what we wanted with it. We spent months in that tiny world, building very little but making the things that counted. I remember one specific time when we worked for a day to smelt enough glass for an underwater house and built it over the course of a week. It was tiny and crude, but it was a huge accomplishment. We discovered the LAN duplication glitch and filled a chest in the house with diamond, gold, and iron blocks, and felt satisfied. It was enough to be able to show our work off to friends who came over for LAN parties.

It's hard to pick specific memories from that time to highlight, but one in particular does stand out to me: our youngest brother (who was around 3 now) got on the ipad, found flint and steel, and accidentally burned down our ""grand"" wooden house. I remember going in and seeing a mass of fences, doors, beds, and slabs just floating in midair on top of freshly grown grass. Sure, we were mad at him for it, but we couldn't do much about it. We decided to duplicate a massive amount of tnt and blow the entire mountain apart, and when there was no mountain left, we kept going until we created our own unnatural cave system. We decorated this cave with crags and spikes, and then took out all the torches and left it as a ""gauntlet challenge"" for us and our friends to run through, fight monsters, and fight each other in. Minecraft's simplicity combined with our simple ideas seemed to create endless hours of magic.

Then one Christmas (I think it was 2014), my parents got us an xbox 360 and a used copy of the physical minecraft disc. Many features from the current editions were missing on this copy, but the few new features we did have were enough for us and our friends to spend more countless hours, except this time we made it grand. We spent over a year in one world creating a gigantic theme park, filled in every section with unique games, puzzles, redstone contraptions, and even a tnt cannon testing field. We even made a gigantic pyramid of sandstone stairs lined on the inside with glowstone which covered nearly a 10th of the entire map. We spent many hours here and in other worlds, but as time went on those hours were fewer and farther between. We eventually did get xbox live and install the new updates, but now our friends, my brothers, and I were all preoccupied in our different levels of school. Friends moved away, we moved places, and everything on the gaming front became a little quieter.

I still spent some time watching minecraft videos for a while after we logged off the xbox for the last time, but even that dwindled. Hours of time spent on youtube were slowly replaced by school, work, and increasingly complex social circles. Everyday stress began to eat at the joy I used to feel when gaming. Soon enough, I couldn't even play video games without feeling like I was wasting time that would be better spent working on school or work, because maybe then my stress would be riddled with obligation rather than guilt. I grew up and got swept in the hate towards the game I once loved. I am ashamed to admit that I even derided my youngest brother for playing minecraft, undertale, and roblox. I don't know why, but maybe stress from school, working, and social drama made me jealous of the joy he derived from gaming that I could no longer feel. 

I don't remember much from this time, maybe because I don't want to, but I do remember my mistakes and my weaknesses. I remember harassing my brother, trying (thankfully unsuccessfully) to make him feel bad for doing what he loved. I remember social groups that imploded due to drama and my attempts to glue together groups that weren't meant to be. I remember phases of stress which led to problems I needed therapy for. But one thing did stand out: I learned. I eventually did learn. The hypocrisy I held in bullying my brother was revealed to me after I saw my other brother participate, not because he felt the same animosity I did, but because he wanted to follow me and didn't want to become the target of my ire. I figured out which friends of mine were true and which ones I held onto for the sake of a status quo long since past. I took up habits where my stress could be channel both artistically and physically into works of both art and true personal growth. I finally discovered a passion for the fields of physics and mathematics that I could see myself striving towards. Above all, I grew out of the bitterness and spite that stress and ""grown-up mindset"" had left me, and I learned to appreciate the usefulness in ""useless"" things, allocate my time effectively, and work towards fulfilling goals. It was about time to revisit old ghosts.

Now it's been about 2 years since I started bettering myself. I'm now in college, and at the beginning of the fall I purchased and downloaded minecraft on pc for the first time in my life. I played it quite a lot in the first month of the fall semester -- stumbling through survival, multiplayer, and whatnot -- but I hadn't played it so much. The few moments I did have outside my busy first semester at college were spent watching videos explaining how to play this game I used to understand. However I can't shake the feeling that I won't reexperience the exact same things I did in my nostalgic days. Don't get me wrong, I love the new features, but now I feel it's hard for an old newcomer like me to decide what to do. I love playing this game the few times I think of things to do in it, but i feel I'm hitting brick walls when I try and decide what to do. I've spent the past few days booting up the launcher on a whim, creating a world, and asking ""what now?"". What do you build when you're eager but barren of ideas? What do you do when your friends and brothers have moved on to other games and view your nostalgia-seeking as something quaint and boring? 

Despite this somewhat lost feeling, this drive for nostalgia with no destination in mind, there may be a solution. I haven't finished formalizing this philosophy, but I feel it's promising. Maybe the real way for old-newcomers like me to re-experience minecraft is to create a whole new experience. Maybe I should let go of the past and start creating things untied to them. Like the beginning, nothing has to be grand, I can be content with what I can manage. I could probably go the whole rest of my life without using some of the features that have been added in the last 4-5 years. I could probably never figure out what the redstone comparator does and be fine with it. All that matters right now is that I build something new. And maybe, just maybe someday, I'll be skilled enough again to realize some truly grand ideas.

Thank you if you read till the end. I'm not the most subtle or skilled storyteller, but I felt getting my story out was a necessary step to help me move forward.

frjsan,TravisHalls,"I am Looking For a Specific Public Castle Map, PLEASE HELP I HAVE SPENT HOURS TRYING TO FIND IT!","About 6-8 years ago, I found a castle map on I believe Planet Minecraft.  I have spent about 4 hours going through the listings without and luck.  I am hoping someone here can remember it as it was a pretty popular map.  

Here is a description: It is a randomly generated map.  The castle itself has 10 or more levels, each floor has a specific theme.  One Floor is a prison(which led to a fighting pit), another was an armory, another was a guest/officer sleeping quarters, one was a safe, and so on and so on.  Surrounding the castle was an outer wall housing a stable and archery area.  Surrounding that wall was a long wall that had a town and a drydock.  The town was largely unfished and had block pillars set up for what appeared to be McEdit tools.  That wall had an even longer wall which acted as a frontier wall.  Right outside that wall, there were various outposts.    


Another mark of the map was all the hidden passageways and secrets.  I remember that there was a wall water fountain that led to a secret library and sleeping area and the chests were filled with gold and diamonds.

&amp;#x200B;

The Kappa would be a nuetral mob and attack in groups. A Kappa will attack passive mobs at night. They can spawn in any biome primarily swamps and rivers. A new structure they would bring is a Kappa Hut, a 3 x 4 x 3 structure made of Kelp Blocks and Dark Prismarine Blocks , that can generate a chest filled with random Kappa item drops. The drops that a Kappa can drop if killed are a 1% chance of dropping a Turtle Shell, 19% of dropping Lily Pad, 30% of dropping Slime, and the other percentages are for a random aquatic item that can be dropped in game; Sponge, Nautilus Shell, Seagrass, Coral, etc... Upon dying, a water source block will appear in its upper bodies place. Like Piglins, you are able to barter with these mobs using Prismarine Blocks.

frj1wh,Earthern-Hunter,"Some questions about modding, recommendations, etc.","Hi, 

I'm looking to get into minecraft on the pc which is something I haven't done before, it would be with a few friends and I was having a look at some mods to see what would be cool to have. 

I came across a mod pack called Roguelike Adventures and Dungeons and it got me thinking. I like the idea of having a game with quests, dungeons, roleplaying and character building, from what I understand this mod pack contains those things, though as I say, I'm not really that versed with modding in minecraft, and was wondering if anyone could confirm that. 

Additionally, would anyone recommend any similar packs that would cover those things? I also like the idea of it being a medieval or fantasy kind of theme, even using a different texture set for the world and creatures, etc. 

The only other thing I wasnt sure about is, does it matter who you host the server with? Do modpacks only work with specific versions of the game so I would need to be running that version, and once a server is rented, how do I add the mods? 

I've ran a server for rust before, and the mods were added by going into the folders of the server and adding files, would this be the same? 

I wasnt sure what flair to put this under, I assumed data packs was talking about mod packs but may be wrong.

frit7y,FoulerHorizon40,Help Finding a Server,"On [minehut.gg](https://minehut.gg) (if you don't know what that is then look it up), there is a popular type of server which has upgrade paths for your gear. An example is killing some sheep to get mutton, trading mutton in to a villager to get a weapon, and then using that weapon to kill something stronger, then using the loot from the stronger mob to combine it with your current weapon to get an even stronger weapon, etc. Same goes with all other gear like armor, pickaxes, bows, and other items. If you don't know any specific servers of that style of upgrading/grinding, do you have any ideas of what I could possibly look up to find that style of server. The reason I don't want to play on server that's on minehut is because they are very temporary and usually get shut down very fast.

I'm sick of it. I tried requesting minecraft support and it was the WORST thing I've ever seen in my life they stated ""Log out and back in again."" I was so incredibly PISSED at that response I almost requested an account deletion. There is no way for me to do anything at all on minecraft so I'm gonna ask

Well in this save, I happened to find 4 all within 100 blocks from each other less than 1000m from spawn: Two zombie, two skeleton (and I just found an abandoned mineshaft in the mix as well, so i imagine I'll find a couple cave spiders spawners as well (wee!) Anyway, I lit up/stopped spawns on the two under ground, and turned the topside two into grinders. They were both working fine until I add hoppers and auto sorters to them. Before, I'd afk for a bit, come back and have so many in the kill chamber that it was miserably laggy. Now, I'm lucky to pool 16 in half an hour. What have I done...?

I used xisumavoid's dig out plan from like 8 years ago (without the Redstone crusher).
I only drop them a few blocks, no fall damage.
I don't think they're despawning.
I afk right in front of kill chamber which is within 16 blocks from spawner.
They aren't close enough to each other to run them both at once, but just in case, I went and lit up the topside zombie spawner too so I could try and get max spawns from the skeleton spawner. Didn't seem to help.

frh7x9,funkyturtl,Question: Nether: How does game relate 'Earthy' World to Nether World?,"Me: Newish to Minecraft; Don't understand portal mappings from Earthy World to Nether

Context: Currently in a Realm with two others. There are four portals in Earthy World, and two in the Nether. Three of the portals in the Earthy World connect to just one of the portals in the Nether (the other mapping is 1 to 1). 

Question: Why do these three Earthy World portals connect to a single Nether portal? 

My thoughts: These three Earthy World portals are sufficiently far away (with respect to y axis, North/South, these portals are really far away-- like half the map away-- one of the portals is half a map north of the other; with respect to x axis, East/West, the portals have similar x-coordinates; wrt z axis idk). 

I read on the wiki that the algorithm for nether portal generation neglects one of the coordinates (the y coordinate). Does this have something to do with what's happening here (and is my coordinate system description helpful?), or perhaps is there another element to Nether Portals, and traveling among them, that I do not know?

Get a Zombie Villager (I think it's a 5% chance everytime the game spawns in a zombie)

Heal Zombie Villager

Give Villager the Librarian Job by placing a Lecturn near the villager

Make sure one of the first trades is emeralds for bookshelves 

Level up the villager to level 2 so that one of the level 2 trades is books for emeralds.

The discounted prices lead to the villager selling you more emeralds than what the books are worth
