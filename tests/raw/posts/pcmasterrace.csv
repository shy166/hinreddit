fsog51,tonynca,Is there a DP to HDMI 2.0b adapter?,"Ok, so I have 3 4k monitors. 

(2) LG 27UD68-W 

(1) Acer XB273K Pb

The issue I'm having right now is that this Acer monitor is so beastly that it requires 2 DP cables to reach 144hz. Problem is that most graphics cards are usually 4 ports (3 DP, 1 HDMI) but my stupid LG monitors cannot output 4k @ 60hz on HDMI it requires that I run DP to get that resolution and refresh rate. 

Is there an adapter of sort for me to convert my DP cable to HDMI 2.0b so I could plug one of my LG monitors into the HDMI port? Thanks in advance.",8,1585699150,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsog51/is_there_a_dp_to_hdmi_20b_adapter/,pcmasterrace,0

fsms1u,Mcfragger,Question on unmounting a RAID 0 drive for /spotfix,"Windows 10Drive in question is 2x 1tb samsung evo 860 in RAID 0

Hey there people!  I've recently been having some issues with my system randomly shutting down, so I decided to investigate.First I checked windows event log, and there was a nice fresh error, staring me in the face.

\***Volume D: (\\Device\\HarddiskVolume1) needs to be taken offline for a short time to perform a Spot Fix.  Please run ""CHKDSK /SPOTFIX"" locally via the command line, or run ""REPAIR-VOLUME &lt;drive:&gt;"" locally or remotely via PowerShell.**\*

So I opened up cmd and did a chkdsk /scan on D:Here is the result

**Stage 1: Examining basic file system structure ...**

**92672 file records processed.**

**File verification completed.**

**20 large file records processed.**

**0 bad file records processed.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stage 2: Examining file name linkage ...**

**19 reparse records processed.**

**101412 index entries processed.**

**Index verification completed.**

**0 unindexed files scanned.**

**0 unindexed files recovered to lost and found.**

**19 reparse records processed.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Stage 3: Examining security descriptors ...**

**Security descriptor verification completed.**

**4371 data files processed.**

**CHKDSK is verifying Usn Journal...**

**41873112 USN bytes processed.**

**Usn Journal verification completed.**

**Windows has found problems that must be fixed offline.**

**Please run ""chkdsk /spotfix"" to fix the issues.**

...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, I went to do /spotfix and I got this ARE YOU SURE message, which is where I need some advice

**Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another**

**process.  Chkdsk may run if this volume is dismounted first.**

**ALL OPENED HANDLES TO THIS VOLUME WOULD THEN BE INVALID.**

**Would you like to force a dismount on this volume? (Y/N)**

&amp;#x200B;

Now here's the thing, my D: is actually 2 SSD's in RAID0.  This drive contains everything on my system except windows, which is on its own boot drive.If I go through the spotfix, will I come out with a usable drive?  Or is it going to break the raid configuration and leave me with 2 unusable drives?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR is it ok to run a /spotfix command on a raid 0 volume??

Let me know if I can provide additional info!

fsm0zd,PlanetZack,Is it a bad idea to build in a cardboard case?,"It's finally happening. With the help of a hefty tax return and not buying coffees at Tim Hortons for a very long time, I have finally purchased everything I could have possibly wanted for a PC. This isn't my first build, but it may as well be because it's my first solo build. 

Now here's the problem: everything except the case has arrived. 
Add some stress: Covid-19 has got my work place setting me up from home. Tonight 830pm. I arrive home approximately 615pm.
Small relief: I have a macbook pro, which I use on a regular. My goodness do I wish I had a little more power to play more games.
Slightly more stress: My work place is able to install my work software onto the iOS. But, they're likely not going to want to do it twice (for the PC) as they've got about 100 other people to set up as well. 

Now that the scene is set, what do you think my chances are that I can go from parts in boxes, to functioning PC in 2.5 hours. My case is set to arrive on Monday, I'm not particularly opposed to being a little more patient, but I am because I don't want to work on my macbook for the foreseeable future.

fsksqk,Beefi1123,Help Me Diagnose during Quarantine!,"Hi everyone,

I've got an aging Lenovo y510p from 2013 that I've fixed multiple times including the LCD, HDD, RAM, and sound board. Once again, it went out today.

It starts to boot, but then immediately shuts off after \~5-10 seconds, never getting past the boot screen. Then, automatically, it rinses and repeats continuously. I initially thought it was my power block, because its wires have been fraying for years, but then here's the spooky part (and note that earlier in the day this was different):

It won't turn on at all if it's plugged in, but if unplugged, it goes through the boot-shutdown cycle. If it was the battery block, I assume this wouldn't happen.

Any ideas?

Also, please don't just say motherboard unless you really know what you're talking about. I'm not gonna just trash the thing based on random internet opinions.

I've been trying to add an additional standard 1 TB HDD but every time I do the PC fans &amp; motherboard lights will turn on for a split second and then turn off.

When I tried the 5th SATA port the PC booted but the drive was not shown in Windows 10. I looked down and the SATA data port was smoking on the motherboard. Fortunately, I powered everything off and other than my SATA port being melted everything is functioning properly.

I want a board that looks good this time, because my current board is ugly AF. If I didn't care about looks, I would just go to best buy and get an X570 TUF Wifi (which IMO is very ugly, but well reviewed)

I was looking at those two options, being that: 

A) I don't have a pci 4.0 ssd, and I don't intend on getting one any time soon. I think it will be like another 5 years before the gpu's come close to maxing the 3.0 x16 bandwidth.

B) don't really care too much about the wifi, mostly just that it has some bluetooth function, which both do.

C) I have a R5 2600 currently and have no issue with updating the bios, seeing as I don't really feel the need to upgrade CPU this time, and wait for the 4000 series. 

Since I play at 1440p, I'm not really CPU bottlenecked.

&amp;#x200B;

I like the crosshair because it is pretty much a high end board, although its older. I also like that it doesn't have a chipset fan, which I hear they can be pretty loud, thus ruining my watercooled silence.

I like the features of the Aorus pro, but it costs another 30$ more, and I'm not sure the 4.0 pci and 5.0 BT are worth the extra money for me. Also the chipset fan thing.

fsk869,LaughinTucker75,"New build, old tech","So I recently decided that I would use a good portion of my tax return to build a new PC for gaming and 3D rendering.  I'm a senior in computer engineering, so I avoid build-it-for-you sites like the plague.  I wanted some serious upgrades from my FX-6300, 8GB DDR3, MSI Twin Frozr III Radeon HD 7970 3GB GDDR5, HDD setup.  I decided on a Ryzen 7 3700x, Asus ROG-Strix B450-F, G.Skill TridentZ RGB 32GB DDR4 3600, ML240L liquid cooler, and an SK Hynix 1Tb SSD.  At first, I was going to keep the old case (Corsair Carbide Spec-02), graphics card, and power supply (BFG EX-1000), however, the liquid cool wouldn't really fit in the old case, so that was the first extra replacement (cue me disassembling the new PC and rebuilding it in a new case, then rebuilding the old pc with a 320W PSU and Nvidia GT440 I had lying around).  With the new system, I saw boot times and systems speeds I had only dreamed of, but there was still something missing.  Note - the B450-F, Ryzen 7 setup says that RAM speed maxes at 3000; after playing in the bios with the latest update, the system is running fantastically at 4.1GHz CPU speed and 3570 RAM speed.  Everything is running perfectly...except games, which are stuck in low graphic settings on the 9 year old graphics card.  So I bit the bullet and purchased an Asus ROG-Strix Geforce RTX 2070 Super, and let me tell you, I love it!  I'm now running all of my games on ultra graphics with no issues.  It seems that I have everything I want in my new build right down to the full custom lighting, and I even have my old PC up and running (with an upgrade to 16 GB RAM, although way under-powered with only a 4 pin CPU power connector).  On the other hand, it might be worth it to upgrade the power supply with everything else, although I never intended to replace half the parts and tried to stay under $900, at this point I'm in it almost $1400 and there's only one part not replaced.  The old PSU, which I got in a trade for an old laptop, is 11 years old now.  I see people not giving the best praise for BFG power supplies, but dang I gotta give this thing props.  I've been using it, second hand, for over 5 years and it has never let me down, and is still running great with the increased demand of a new PC.  The debate I have now is this:  do I keep this old PSU in the newbie til she gives up or do I upgrade again, or do say the heck with it and push the new build over $1500 and get a new 750W or 850W (less power but newer and warrantied).  If I stick with this ol' reliable, I don't need to rebuild the PC (again) and I can keep going how I am, but if I get a new PSU, I can put the old one in the old PC and be able to use the HD 7970 in it, which would make it not a bad build for it's age.  I'm torn on this right now as I really shouldn't be putting any more money into this project, let alone what I've already spent on it, but it's so close to being a 100% new PC.  I am totally open to any advice this awesome community is willing to give.  Sorry for such a long post, I know I'm not the only one who shares this passion for nerd stuff and It's awesome to have a place to share it.  Thanks for reading, have a good one Ya'll!

Now my problem is that the CPU stays constantly at 100%, running anything newer than 2014, Battlefield 1, 5, and 4 are unplayable because of the stutters. (4 worked fine untill a few years ago), red dead redemption 2 gets a max of 20FPS on a sunny day, It refuses to boost past 3.1 Ghz, on a single core, I can't run firefox at the same time as minecraft, and The Witcher 3 gets more than 60FPS for 20 seconds then freezes.

Its not thermal throtling, temps are under 80\* at max load, Replaced thermal paste but still the stock cooler. spikes to 100% just editing word files, no dust in the heatsink, Every performance enhancing option turned on in the bios. 

I tried to find an unlocked bios, just so I could get it to atleast 3.5 Ghz, as I've seen some videos where it dropped the cpu usage to 80% in BF1. 

Cant really get a new cpu because the country is in lockdown, And not many people need a photographer during a pandemic.

What should i do? Should I just try to unlock the BIOS myself? I have some limited assembly knowledge so I could try...",13,1585682703,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsjeem/how_can_i_squeeze_as_much_performance_as_i_can/,pcmasterrace,1

My options:

1 - Western Digital P10 Game Drive 5TB - 149,99‚Ç¨

Good point is because have a lot of space for the low price - I don't know if is safe buy this one because is made for ""games"".. I don't understand if will work or not for what I want, but for low price and have a lot of space - USB 3.2

2 - Western Digital My passport 5TB - 179,90‚Ç¨

fsizsy,the_baboo,What do I upgrade?,"I am currently in the market to upgrade my gaming PC with a budget of about $620. 

My current build 

* GPU: ASUS 1060
* CPU: i5-4690 quad core
* RAM: 8 GBs
* Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H97M-HD3
* Case: Xigmatek Aquila (Micro ATX, [Link to case specs](https://www.xigmatek.com/product_detail.php?item=135)). 

The games I am currently playing are things like Escape from Tarkov, Warzone, and occasionally LoL. When I play games like EFT and Warzone, my computer struggles to do other tasks like running Chrome or Discord. 

I was planning on upgrading the following: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/M8tgtp](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/M8tgtp).

Linus and several other people tried that on their channels and it worked for them too. My graphics card were already crashing games so I was like ""fuck it, will do"" and now it's working again, like it didn't even start to die in the first place.

Wanna have a discussion about it with people who already did the same thing. How long it lasted after the ""baking method""?

This WONT be my main monitor as I do photo editing on a BenQ PD3200u, so IQ is not a big concern although I wont mind if its decent.

I was pretty much set on the XL2540 after reading a lot and seeing how many Pro gamers use that one but then today I learned about the XF252Q that has newer panels and the AORUS KD25F ( I got other Arous gear so not a bad look :D). 
I am using a 9900K @5Ghz all cores and 1080ti (waiting for next gen before upgrading).  
So if someone can guide of as to which of those is a better option, I would really appreciate it. The XF252Q is $50 cheaper than the other two and all arrive on Friday if I order soon which will make for a perfect gaming weekend lol

fshxgm,SharkOnGames,Arctis 9x Wireless and Windows 10. How to get Windows to see it as a headset and not an xbox controller?,"Hello!    


I've got a new SteelSeries Arctis 9x Wireless headset and I've got it connected to my Windows 10 PC using the xbox wireless USB dongle.  

The issue I have is that windows recognizes it as a xbox controller and I cannot control the volume of the headset inside windows (only the volume control on the headset works).  Meaning if I mute my speakers (using speaker icon) or turn the volume up/down in windows it has no effect on the volume in the headset.    


I've set the headset (which shows up as xbox controller) as default device in audio settings in windows already.    


Any idea on how to get this thing to show up has an actual headset so that windows can control the volume?    


One of the benefits of this headset is that you can connect both a bluetooth device and a wireless device (through the xbox usb dongle) and mix the chat volumes in the headset (using the mix wheel on the headset itself), but this doesn't work for me at all and I think it's because windows isn't able to control the volume.    


I really like the headset otherwise.  Please help!",0,1585678159,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fshxgm/arctis_9x_wireless_and_windows_10_how_to_get/,pcmasterrace,2

Then I have massive frame drops that can last seconds or just wont go away. Tabbing out has my mouse glitching all over the place and generally hard to do anything.  It even happens out of games too! Like watching videos or browsing the internet also.
Restarting it works sometimes but it usually happens again almost immediately.

No programs are running in startup. Not sure what it could be. I‚Äôm assuming hardware at this point since I‚Äôve done fresh installs about 4 times over the past few months. It also worked perfectly fine when I first built it!

So far I‚Äôve tested the memory and I‚Äôm in the process of testing GPU but I thought if my GPU was failing it would be more...dramatic?

fsfwdx,sabrefudge,Laptop for..... Sims 4?,"PC Master Race,

I am but a humble console player myself, but my girlfriend plays games on her computer.  Specifically Sims 4.  

She currently plays it on this old low end Thinkbook so it‚Äôs constantly freezing and crashing.  Very frustrating as you can imagine.  

We‚Äôre hoping to get her a new laptop specifically to play Sims and the occasional Nancy Drew or similar game on.  Doesn‚Äôt need a super high frame rate, 4K resolution, etc.  She doesn‚Äôt use mods.  Just something she can play these simple games out with less issue than her current setup.

I‚Äôve purchased and modified computers for video editing before, but PC gaming is a completely foreign field to me.  Which is why I thought you all might have insight.

Money is tight, so we need to keep it under $500.  Hoping this will be possible, given the limited nature of her gaming.

Any recommendations?

Thank you.",2,1585671714,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsfwdx/laptop_for_sims_4/,pcmasterrace,1

fsfqgu,coaltrain895,Problems regarding 100% cpu usage,"Hello all, I‚Äôm fairly new to the pc world, i built my first rig a little over a year ago.  It has been flawless all the way up to this past weekend. i have been noticing it‚Äôs getting ‚Äúlaggy‚Äù, for lack of better terms, from time to time. It just seems like the whole system studders.

My best example is when playing american truck simulator, i will get random freezing and an occasional conplete game crash. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not the game, as i have never had any issue‚Äôs with the game before. 

Well i know i don‚Äôt have the best of cpu‚Äôs, so i decided to pull up task manager and keep an eye on the cpu usages. Task manager was using between 7-15% on average with it being the only window open.

i then started and played the game on top of task manager. Keeping an eye on usage it would peak near 85% but in that time the game did not crash nor even stutter. i also noticed this morning, i had forgot to close task manager before shutting the computer down last night. When i booted it back up this morning task manager was still open and was showing a pegged 100% usage for a solid 2-3 minutes.

I‚Äôm not the most knowledgeable when it comes to this type of trouble shooting. i included my parts list below. Could it be that my cpu just isn‚Äôt enough to keep up with the rest of my setup or could it be nothing hardware related at all?

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!

first of all I don't know if this is the right subreddit for my topic, but let me get straight to the point.

After first day of use I noticed my lower back and legs hurt a little bit. After playing around a bit I set up the correct height and backrest. But nothing has changed. Also, I don't use the lumbar support pillow, I find it to thick. My question is should I use the lumbar support or no? Maybe that is the problem but I just don't feel comfortable enough. Also, how is it possible to feel more comfortable on a classic wooden chair you can find in any kitchen, did anyone have similar problems?

For some time now, my computer's monitor hasn't been working - I know it's the monitor, since for awhile I was still able to access the computer itself via chrome remote desktop and steam remote access as a (clunky) workaround, but as of a few days ago it must have disconnected from the wi-fi entirely, as it is no longer online, though everything else *appears* to be fine and still running. Now, however, the monitor itself just says ""Power-Saving Mode"" as if the actual PC didn't exist.

Previously when this happened, I just disconnected/reconnected the [monitor cables](https://www.google.com/search?q=monitor+cable&amp;hl=en&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02quzTIDT6lCgunTdjh1Ib-Vaf-Tg:1585667584476&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrzeqIgMXoAhXhYt8KHbprBCcQ_AUoAnoECBEQBA&amp;biw=1385&amp;bih=717#imgrc=C5iuExSDVsTmzM), but now even that doesn't work, and the monitor still says ""power saving mode"". Does anyone know what's wrong/what I can do to fix it?

fseqav,Fordari,Best fans I‚Äôve used,"For all those endlessly searching for fans that provide high airflow and low noise, search no more. 

After using fans such as; of Deepcool‚Äôs RF/CF 120‚Äôs and 140‚Äôs,  PC Cooler Corona, BeQuiet! Silent Wings 3, and Noctua‚Äôs NF-F12, I was sorely disappointed by their noise levels, especially at idle. 

What many reviews dont discuss or mention, is the fact that some fan bearings, from the factory, are noisier than others. Each of the fans above had some sort of bearing issue causing them to make a ‚Äòbrushing‚Äô or ‚Äòtapping‚Äô noise around 500. Some people may not perceive noise at this level, but for me it makes all the difference in a silent build.

Of the fans above, I give credit to PC Cooler for being inexpensive but also allowing one to remove the blades of the fan which in turn, enables one to clean the bearing and re-lube it as necessary.

At the end of my search, I stumbles upon Blacknoise‚Äôs NoiseBlocker eLoop‚Äôs. Not only do they have a neat design, they are extremely quiet at idle speeds (450 rpm). The bearing is inaudible, and from what i‚Äôve seen, allows blade removal if the bearing needs to be cleaned. 

After going through many fans, I can say that I‚Äôm sticking to these NB-eLoops for the rest of time!",3,1585667917,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fseqav/best_fans_ive_used/,pcmasterrace,3

fsegc2,nollie_shuv,Need some windows wizards to help me have a happier PC/PS4 life,"I'll try to be as concise as I can here. I am an avid PC gamer and have been for as long as I can remember. My brother is unfortunately a console peasant so we play together that way. I have a nice set of optical headphones that I use on my PC and switching them over to my PS4 is annoying since I play them interchangeably quite often. To solve this issue I started using the Remote Play feature. What this does is allow me to channel the audio, video and controller through my PC (my ps4 controller plugged in to PC) so I don't have to swap headphone connections each time. This for the most part works well but since my connection is through this horrendous Remote Play app on the desktop it leaves me vulnerable to disconnects for some reason. It works nicely 90% of the time but if the controller becomes unplugged or there is a blip in the network connection it totally bumps me off of my party chat with my brother or causes the controller to be unresponsive until I restart the program. This obviously sucks for competitive gaming and any games that require a constant internet connection since even unplugging the controller will disrupt that connection let alone it happening on it's own randomly. Sorry for the rambling mess here but I'm just curious if anyone has any ideas that could help, my latest idea is that I just go back to playing straight off the PS4 and find another shit pair of headphones to plug in to avoid this headache. The remote play seemed great but it's starting to wear on my nerves.

I‚Äôve been looking at what parts to buy from EKWB, but stumbled across two different distroplates, a [side](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-classic-dp-side-pc-o11d-g1-d-rgb-ddc-3-2-pwm) and [front](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-classic-dp-front-pc-o11d-d-rgb-spc-pwm-5801) one. Is there a difference between these two? &amp; if not, which would you recommend? 

I've also been looking online and I like the idea of seeing the plate at the front, but as I am planning to have a radiator at the top and bottom of my case, the space where the side plate would be is going to be empty if I decide to have a front plate.

fsduhp,VeryPaulite,Possibly busted Monitor or Broken GPU (Port),"Hey I hope it's ok that I post this over here, I have posted it as a question in the r/pcgaming subreddit as well, but I hope to reach a few more people:

Guess I should start with the specs first:

I use a delidded i7 7700k, a GTX 1060 6 GB and 32 Gb 4x 8 Corsaird Dominator Platinum 3200 mHz RAM, and I have windows 10.

Now my problem:

I use a MSI Optix-MAG271CQR, and I love it dearly.

But, because of the virus, I had to move my system home, so I packaged it all into the packaging it came with and drove it home in my car. I can't imagine anything happening to it, since it's packaged rather well in Styrofoam, I even took of the stand and all so it's just the display safe in its original shipping.  
Though upon returning home, I set everything up, including my secondary monitor, some LG Ultrawide, MSI through DP, LG over HDMI. But I can't help notice, on the MSI Monitor, some weird ""streaks"" where there are weird lines. Upon turning it on, some of the pixels were white and sometimes, the image seems to move and then return. It's as if someone took a screenshot, pushed it down to the left and then made it translucent, if that makes any sense.

Now what I've tried is running the monitor via HDMI, and I don't see this effect, I tried both DP Ports on my GPU, and it all appears either way. I have also tried connecting the LG Monitor via Display-port (that's what I'm currently using to type this) and the Effect doesn't seem to happen.   
That, to me at least, suggests that it's not my GPUs Display-Port being dead, but instead something being wrong with my monitor. Though on the other hand, since the problem seems to be limited to the Display-Port, maybe it is ""just"" a software Problem? Is there anything I could do, to fix it myself, or do I just package the display again, and send it in? The Display is still under waranty, the GPU is not.

fsdtbz,Magnezone13,RGB Capabilities Help,"I am looking for a very specific solution and I am not sure if anyone has the answer, or if the answer even exists.  I'm reaching out to seek help from anyone with experience in addressable RGB ecosystems.

My problem: I want to add software control of addressable RGB products in a way where I can individually control the color of each LED. I would like to add the new Lian Li Strimer Plus cables to my build and this ability will help them stand out and be a unique showcase within the system.  I'll list some of the ideas I have had below and their limitations/why I think they won't work.  If anyone has ideas or advice that will help me, I'd love to hear them!

Asus Aura Sync:  My initial thought was that the Strimer Plus is already compatible with Aura Sync boards, so it should be able to be controlled there.  The problem with this, however, is that Asus does not let you individually control the colors of each connected LED in an addressable strip, instead opting for moving effects.  To me, this defeats the purpose of an addressable strip, as I would prefer to set individual static colors on each LED.  I searched around for a bit to see if there were any third-party softwares that would allow more control of the LEDs than Aura provides, but was unable to find anything (which is not to say that it doesn't exist, I may just not have found it).

iCUE:  My next idea was to use Corsair's iCUE since I already use it for their light strips and have used it for their fans in the past.  I have access to 2 Lighting Node Pros, and third-party cables exist to connect non-Corsair products to the ecosystem, so this would be easy to set up.  The only issue with this solution is that the number of LEDs on each channel of the LNP is limited to 40 by the Corsair software (likely due to power limitations of the hardware). The Strimer Plus 24 pin has 120 LEDs while the 8 pin has 108, so this prevents me from using iCUE.  The Strimer cables have their own power delivery, so the power limitations of the Corsair hardware would not be the limiting factor here, just that the software will not allow more than 40 LEDs per channel at once.  If there is any way to bypass this limit, this solution could work.

NZXT CAM:  Similar to iCUE, CAM also allows individual customization of LEDs on its strips, and I do have a spare Hue 2 that I am not currently using. Again, due to power delivery issues, each channel is limited to 40 LEDs, creating the same issue as the Lighting Node Pro.

Thermaltake Ring Plus RGB:  This is a bit less common than the previous two ecosystems, but Thermaltake also has a software-controlled method of individually controlling LED colors using their Pacific Lumi Plus hardware.  Again, the number of LEDs per channel is limited, but this time, it is implied that only 36 LEDs can be controlled at a time.

Asus ROG Terminal:  This solution is the worst of both worlds.  It has a limitation for the number of LEDs that can be controlled and it also is controlled by the Asus Aura software, meaning that there is no per-LED light customization option.

Arduino/Pi:  This is the only solution that I am confident would be able to do exactly what I am looking for, but I do not know where to start.  If anyone has done a similar project and can give me some initial direction, I would gladly set up something using one of these controllers if there really is no better way.

fsdlpk,MrMelleJ,Multiple 4K Monitors,"Hello /r/pcmasterrace, I'm currently using one 4K 60Hz monitor and had another one 1080p which broke down today. Due to the fact I already wanted to replace it (due to it being a small one) it's not that big of a deal. I wanted to get a similar one then the 4K I already use due to it (assumingly) looking good.

The main question I have if is my videocard (GTX1070) is able to properly run both 4K monitors and also still able to get 'decent' results when trying to run games. I'm planning on using 1 as the primary monitor where the game will also be on, and the other mainly to view other programs on (Spotify, Discord, Firefox, Netflix and YouTube etc.). Currently that gave no issues to me and I was completely happy with it but I'm not sure what the impact of having a 4K monitor instead of the Full HD one is.

fsckrl,Petroviczech,bluetooth audio device lagging after a while,"Hey guys,

I   have a problem with my audio bluetooth devices. I am mainly using   Marshall headphones. They have a microphone for phone calls and it is   connected with audio device. It sounds like the old phone calls - when i   am using the device for calls the microphone sounds like i am talking   under a pillow and the sound I hear sounds like it is under a pillow -   so it is a device for phone calls. (I hope you understand)

And   then there is a normal device - headphones without a microphone and   that is the main device for sound - good quality. But after a while when   is nothing playing or there is no audio it starts to lag. I have found   out a solution that fixes it for some time but it is only few seconds -  I  can switch the audio device to the headset for phones calls and then   switch back and it works for a few seconds. Or I can play something on   background for example music on spotify and mute it. PC thinks that   something is playing although i cannot hear it and it doesnt start to   lag.

But this is very frustrating.   It does the same thing when i use bluetooth speaker with small   microphone. Does someone know what to do with that lagging? Thanks and I   hope you can understand me.

fsccjt,biskitman12321,"Sold a laptop that was working, they claim it's not turning on","I have had an MSI gaming laptop for a year and a bit now, i7 and 1060, and have had a few issues with it.

It started blue screening when playing any game and just generally being a pain. I eventually sent it off to MSI for repair, where they said they successfully repaired it by doing motherboard repair and swapping a RAM module. 

When I got it back, it was reset to factory settings, with all the default software etc. Having enough of the laptop and being short on money, I sold it on Gumtree for ¬£700 as I believed that it would be working just fine having just come back from MSI themselves. It turned on okay, worked fine for google etc.

When the guy came to buy it, i let him turn it on, use it and connect it to the internet, and eventually he considered it okay and we did the deal. Now he is calling me up saying the screen is black and it won't turn on but there is a power led on.

As I sold it (to my knowledge) working, would I have to give a refund?

fsbylf,daddyodevil,Trying to gauge the performance of AMD 5600M and 5700M.,"Here there is a spec sheet of all the AMD cards, https://www.techarp.com/computer/amd-radeon-rx-5700m-5600m/

I am trying to approximate what will be the performance difference from a 5500M. Though all the specs of 5600M have a higher value than 5500M, the clock speed is lower, thus I am not being able to factor it in.

As for 5500M and 5700M -
Max pixel rate and ROP are about 30% better
63% more processors
About 70% more in everything else assuming very little difference in clocks.

I did a calculation without any knowledge of any of the specs mean, just fyi.

So the 5700M can be about 200 or 225 or 250 or 270% better than the 5500M under controlled environments which in this case will be adequate cooling and thermal management of the laptops.

The Nvidia cards have the following approximate hierarchy -

1660Ti = 5500M + 20%
2060 = 1660Ti + 20% = 5500M + 44%
2070 = 2060 + 27% = 5500M + 80%
2080 = 2070 + 8 to 10% = 5500M + 100%

That is given everything same 5700M might be equal to 2080 mobile or better.

But then if 5600M is less powerful than 5700M, so can it be 2070 equivalent ?",0,1585657327,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsbylf/trying_to_gauge_the_performance_of_amd_5600m_and/,pcmasterrace,1

fsbrcy,eatTHEnut,Apple's transition to ARM - what does this mean for existing software and PCs?,"--I understand you might feel strongly about Apple, but please keep this civil--

[There are numerous rumors Apple will be shifting to ARM based CPUs with their Mac lineup](https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/24/apple-to-release-first-arm-mac-without-intel-processor-in-next-18-months-predicts-kuo/). It all makes sense to me due to numerous benefits of the ARM platform, especially for the Mac (better efficiency and performance) as well as giving Apple independence. Even one of my EE professors (an amazing engineer!) was always saying that ARM will prevail.

My questions here are:

1) What happens to all the software written for x86? It will probably have to be recompiled (is this possible?) for ARM.

2) Does RISC have any disadvantages compared to CISC? Especially when it comes to more complex programs and powerful computers.

3) And since everybody usually first laughs at Apple and then copies what they did,  do you think we'll see more ARM based desktops and/or laptop?",2,1585656420,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsbrcy/apples_transition_to_arm_what_does_this_mean_for/,pcmasterrace,1

fsbm5a,Delshmann,Gaming Chairs,"Looking for opinions:

Gamer / Student / Full time sitter here.

I am in the market for a new chair for my current set up.

I have no experience in the ""Gaming Chair"" industry but from research i have done, i have come to realise that most of the chairs on the market are just the same chair re-skinned and re-branded for a specific company, then sold at a marked up price depending on the name of the brand. 

My question to you is, ""what is a good chair?""

I am not looking to skimp on price as ergonomics and health are very important to me. 

I am going to be using the chair for mostly studying and then a lot of gaming, cruising Reddit and the internet, and as you might have guessed, sitting. 

I am interested to know what chairs you fellow gamers have enjoyed, what companies to avoid, which chairs are just a re skin of other chairs, and most importantly, Is there a chair that exists as the ""god of all chairs"", or if it does come down to personal preference in the end.  

For reference i am a 6'2 Male, about 75 kilos (165 pounds), with a mild case of APT (Anterior Pelvic Tilt). 

What advice can you give me, and am i right it worrying that it will come down to trying out different chair to see what suits me best. (this is an issue because i am from Perth, Australia. And we don't have the best selection of stores to go to in order to try specific chairs.)

&amp;#x200B;

The last couple weeks my PC has randomly shut off a couple times and I didn't think much of it but tonight it went to another level.

I was playing Ghost Recon when my PC turned off but when I went to turn it back on the fans and RGB turned on for a split second but then turned back off, the EZ Debug LED on my MSI mobo was on the CPU light. I unplugged the PSU and tried to find anything that seemed out of the ordinary but couldn't find anything so I plugged the PSU back in and it turned on.

So far it's turned off 3 or 4 more times and it looks like I need to leave the PSU unplugged for 5ish minutes before I plug it back in and the PC works again.

Any ideas as to what is happening?

fsb7b1,TuesdaysBrunch,New Chair causing interference with monitor,"So, randomly last night my MSI gaming monitor starting flashing black and then turning back on  and then it got to he point where it was just going black and not turning on at all until I shut the monitor off and back on. Had no idea why, thought I had loose cables, then I notice it's only happening when I stand up from my chair. After doing some research online it seems other people are having the same problem and some people even have the same chair as me. I switched from an old wooden kitchen chair to a SecretLab Titan Softweave. From what I could find, the hydraulic system in the chair can emit an electromagnetic pulse that is enough to interfere with the monitor. It could also be a combination of the fabric of the chair, and the fact that I have a steel base on carpet. The most common fix was to buy some Ferrite cable chokers and apply them to my DVI cables, so I placed that order and hopefully  that will fix the problem.

This whole situation is bizarre to me, my question is, I just built this PC and I'm very fond if it. Is there any danger to my PC itself with this situation? I bought a good surge protector where all my cables are plugged in and then the surge protector plugged into the grounded wall socket. I thought about buying an ESD mat for my chair but the only one I saw was $140 and I can't really afford that right now. 

Just want to make sure this bandaid I'm putting on my problem will fix what I need it do and I won't be harming hardware in PC over the years do to being subjected to these static issues.",23,1585653727,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsb7b1/new_chair_causing_interference_with_monitor/,pcmasterrace,1

Ryzen 5 2600
Asus Gtx 1070 ROG
Gskill TridentZ 3000mhz 16gb Ram
256gb Samsung nvme m.2

I was looking for gtx 1080 or ryzen 7 2700/2700x

But I can hardly find 1080 in decent price and in stock. And ryzen 2700 I can get for about ¬£150 and 2700x for abit less than ¬£200

Should I just wait for something better to be released?

fsahjw,Natinam,"For those who care: a funny story about how I tried joining the PC Gaming community in 2014. I was young and lived with my parents still. I thought that consoles were miles ahead of small computers. What could computers do next to loading Word documents, right ?","I always thought a few old 90s games worked on PC and that you needed a console for real gaming.

I discovered PCMR and PC gaming. It was exciting reading about the possibilities of playing old classics on a 500 $ console-killer.

I tried saving money and build my own PC. I bought an r9 270 2gb, i5 4460, 4 gb ram, 1tb hdd, a 30 dollar case, in 2014. I knew maybe a little about PC hardware. Unfortunately, my mom didn't want me building it, so she gave it to IT guys who built the rest arouns it. It cost 800 dollars!! It was maybe worth 450...

Today, after a satisfying 6 years with a bottlenecking  system I didn't know I had, 2 years of forgetting to plug the hdmi into my graphics card and not the empty slot, forgetting to turn on High Performance energy options, I finally live alone, earn money and saved for my first REAL gaming build.

I am crazy excited and I bet some of you were/are too to build it yourself. I try to consume all the information I need to construct a correct, well-balanced computer.

Still happy, this computer gave me some awesome memories, most games even run good on it today, better than the integrated GPU I had.

I'm ready to finally be able to go Ultra on Witcher 3 and AAA titles.

Can't wait to get a nice case with good airflow, a nice CPU, PSU, GPU, with MY components. SSD for the first time, of course. And I will probably be able to enjoy 1440p or higher refresh rates on it, maybe even VR in the furture.

I am very excited. Thought I' d share. I bought Witcher 3 GOTY for 14 dollars, historical low !

I can finally play more than free games or older games. I have my own money and I can buy new AAA games, all the games on Steam that I want at good PC Gaming prices. I love this whole community arouns PC gaming.

I guess my timing is good too because of RAM and SSD prices. Maybe the other components will be cheaper too? I don't know a lot about that, though, ha.

How did you discover PC gaming? What was your first build? What build do you have now, as a probably richer, older person ?",2,1585650103,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fsahjw/for_those_who_care_a_funny_story_about_how_i/,pcmasterrace,1

fsaeig,ams365,Dlss 2.0," 

Hi, how are you?

WHAT is known about DLSS2.0? will it really be as functional as they say?

This is dedicated hardware that only Nvidia graphics cards have, right? so the new XboxSeries X and PS5 consoles can't have this?

How strange that consoles, especially Microsoft's Xbox does not have DLSS if it is precisely Microsoft who invented DirectX12 Ultimate with DLSS2.0.

Steam statistics say that more than 95% of the PCs registered on the platform will be potentially surpassed by the new consoles.

DLSS is a good asset for PCs

But I insist, if the consoles and especially Xbox had DLSS it would be beastly, the death of the PC MASTER RACE. If the Xbox mounted a graphics chip like the RTX2060s it would be cheaper than the 5700 it carries and would have DLSS. And anyway ... because the consoles with AMD5700 have not put DLSS on them? Is it an exclusive NVIDIA patent?

Definitely. All this text is to know why consoles do not have DLSS, if they can and if thanks to DLSS the PC MASTER RACE can breathe easy and continue with its superiority.

I am getting a lot lower fps than I am supposed to. My fps in 5v5 matchmaking is between 60-100, when I am playing on medium settings in 4:3. If I play new Cache or Nuke I can even drop to 50 fps, and I tend to get stuttering in firefights and while molotovs and grenades are thrown.

The fps is also the same no matter the graphics settings. I've tried the very highest \*and\* the very lowest settings and I still get the same fps. Any suggestions? I have updated all my drivers and tried to find physical faults with my PC but I can't find anything. It seems to me that CS might be the issue in some way or another. I've tried to reinstall, but that didn't help either.

Here's my PC:

Graphics card: GTX 1060 6GB OC

CPU: Intel Core i5 6600k

Motherboard: Z170A PC Mate

fsa3u6,theartistperson,My PC won‚Äôt boot.,"My heart is broken right now. 

So I‚Äôve had no prior issues with my PC which makes this all very confusing. 

CPU: Intel i7 4790K
GPU: MSI GTX 1080 ti
RAM: 12GB DDR3 
MOBO: MSI H97M-G43
PSU: 620W

My PC has been running perfectly, I ended up leaving it running for like an hour.

I came back and my screens were off. I could hear my PC was running but the lights on my keyboard and headset were off except for the mouse. 

I saw the power light on my PC was off but the thing fans were still going. So I pressed the power button and nothing happened. I then held it down for 10 seconds. It switched off. But it wouldn‚Äôt turn on again. 

At this point I opened the cassis, and saw a small blue light blinking on the motherboard. I looked at my manual and the only info it gave me was that it means ‚Äòdebug‚Äô not very helpful. 

So I turned off the PSU by the switch. The light blinked for a couple seconds then stopped. I flicked the switch again and turned on the PC. 

Everything except for the power button light turns on. Every fan is spinning, the GPU lights up, the RAM lights up the HDD is spinning, SSD is working I can hear, the whole thing is performing. But, nothing on the screen. 

I smell around to check if anything is burnt. Nothing. 

I‚Äôve reset the CMOS. 
I‚Äôve reseated my RAM. 
I‚Äôve plugged the HDMI into the MOBO.
I‚Äôve checked every plug is connected properly. 
I‚Äôve plugged the PC into different extensions in the house. 
I‚Äôve left it overnight. 

I have no idea what is wrong and I have no idea what to do. 
I can‚Äôt take it anywhere as my country is in lockdown. I need to do work on the PC but now this. 

I‚Äôd really appreciate any help as to what the issue is. I‚Äôm concerned for my files, as I do a lot of graphic design and digital illustration for clients. 

I have time to try and take the PC apart, I‚Äôve never done so before, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

fs8yj6,ams365,DLSS 2.0,"Hi, how are you?

WHAT is known about DLSS2.0? will it really be as functional as they say?

This is dedicated hardware that only Nvidia graphics cards have, right? so the new XboxSeries X and PS5 consoles can't have this?

&amp;#x200B;

How strange that consoles, especially Microsoft's Xbox does not have DLSS if it is precisely Microsoft who invented DirectX12 Ultimate with DLSS2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

Steam statistics say that more than 95% of the PCs registered on the platform will be potentially surpassed by the new consoles.

&amp;#x200B;

DLSS is a good asset for PCs  


But I insist, if the consoles and especially Xbox had DLSS it would be beastly, the death of the PC MASTER RACE. If the Xbox mounted a graphics chip like the RTX2060s it would be cheaper than the 5700 it carries and would have DLSS. And anyway ... because the consoles with AMD5700 have not put DLSS on them? Is it an exclusive NVIDIA patent?  


Definitely. All this text is to know why consoles do not have DLSS, if they can and if thanks to DLSS the PC MASTER RACE can breathe easy and continue with its superiority.

This is what happened:

 Computer then turned off, (though power light was still on.) Flipped switch on PSU, waited for power to drain, turned pc back on. Began starting up, though the systems hiccuped once, (clicking sound, lights turned off momentarily,) but didn't stop boot process. Got past BIOS and to windows loading screen, then computer shuts down. Won't boot up so I turn off the power, wait for it to drain, then try again. Previously, when turning on power, an LED on the GPU would light up. Now, it blinks for a moment before turning off. Can't turn on PC. 

This is the second time this has happened, where the computer boots once and then the motherboard won't receive power.. I thought it was a MoBo issue the first time, so I purchased a new motherboard.

Could it be that the framerate was too high on the map for freesync to handle or something? Because I seriously doubt the map would be lagging due to too low of a framerate especially when it's far less of a problem in normal gameplay.

fs7ewy,GodMeyo,"HPET, TimerResoltuion - can someone give a ""final"" answer?","So i recently stumpled on HPET and TimerResolution and I'm seeing different answers on different threads in different forums and I'm now confused as to what would be the best thing to do.

This is my setup:

MSI z370 Gaming Plus

i5 8600k @ 4,7 GHZ

16 GB TridentZ @ 3200Mhz

OCed 1080 GTX

Only SSDs

FinalMouse

165Hz LCD

I was hearing about windows timings a long time ago but at the beginning it all felt to complicated but yesterday I was watching a performance guide for windows on youtube and this guy mentioned the little programm ""timer resolution"" and how it can massively tweak the responsiveness of your system etc.

So I dug around and read about the topics and some side topics for like 3 hours. the general consensus seems to be that turning HPET off is the way to go. But there are people saying the settings have to match ""on/on or off/off"" in BIOS and OS. Some say just disable OS and keep BIOS to on. Some say disable it in BIOS.

I'm starting to believe there is no right setting and I probably will have to benchmark every setting myself?

If that's the case I again say some people claiming that several latency benchmarks deliver false values in windows 10.

Also how are HPET and the TimerResolution tool related? Is it that I should disable HPET to get a higher resolution in general and ""TimerResolution"" get it even higher? Or is TimerResolution redundant if I disable HPET?

And if there's no final answer, can you give me a very small guide on what benchmarks to use and what values I should achieve?

Since I'm at work right now I just testet this on my work PC (disabling HPET in cmd) and testet it with WinTimerTester. It now gives me a value of 2.53125 Mhz but I can't tell if this is good and I don't know if I can get it any lower. I'm seeing everywhere that ""0.5"" is what everyone aims for. But how do I achieve that?

Thank you very much in advance and sorry that I have to bring up this topic again which has been discussed like a million times.",0,1585633817,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs7ewy/hpet_timerresoltuion_can_someone_give_a_final/,pcmasterrace,1

fs74ow,JackDuals,Overclocked Reference 5700 Flashed XT to 2GHz Fine?,"Hi, first time overclocker here!
I've had me PC (R5 3600 + RX5700) for about a year now and out of quarantine boredom decided to try and fiddle with me 5700.
My 5700 is a reference model, which I flashed to a 5700XT (reference bios as well).

After some reading and video watching on overclocking, I've done some overclocking using Radeon Software (20.2.2). Best I've gotten (and dared lol) with Heaven doing a full benchmark without crashing is:
2045Mhz@1195Mv.
Blower fan running at 80% max (loud I know, but I'm just trying to see how far the card can go) let the card sit at about 80-85C with 95-100C JTemp.
Power usage hovered at around 200ish watts.
Reading the GPU SCLK, it seemed stable at 2GHz during the Heaven benchmark.

At these settings it ran a full Heaven Extreme preset benchmark w/o crashing. 
I also got a jump of 200 points in Valley from 4302 to 4504.

I wanna get an opinion from anyone with overclocking experience. 
Does this first OC of mine seem safe?
Is it fine to run my 5700 at 2GHz constantly gaming for hours?
Any suggestions for better results? Whether I should tune it the frequency down a little, lower the voltage, etc.

This have been a on going issue with games crashing immediately or crashes after a couple minutes in. At first seemed like a direct x issue but then the errors changed and seem like a driver issue. I have reinstalled the driver 6 times now, tried 3 different versions on windows 10 home and after suggestion from nvidia support I reinstalled windows and have windows 10 pro and tried reinstalling them a couple times. I've updated windows multiple times, updated my motherboard bios, updated gpu bios, and have tried changing multiple settings and nothing works. Reinstalling windows did change it from crash immediately to crash a couple minutes in games. so i don't know what changed there. It depends on the game on how long it takes to crash, some games like bf3 I can play for awhile and it might not crash now but escape from tarkov will crash from 1-10 minutes. I did a furmark benchmark and got 8 minutes and I think scored around 3000, I didn't write it down, and was around 52-58 fps. Unigine heaven I got 1383 and unigine valley 2262. Even the benchmarks would crash often mainly heaven. The gpu is fine and came from a friend and worked fine for them so it's not the issue. It is attached to my motherboard with an extension but I don't think that's the issue because I have connected other graphics cards with no issue but was using a different boot drive when I did that. Here's a google drive link to the errors I had and my sysinfo file. Thank you for the help.

Currently a mining engineering student.  Using various AutoCAD software, matlab, the usual.

What is the best laptop (around or under US $2,000) for using these applications, as well as some gaming, perhaps, on the go?

Last laptop was a Dell XPS.  Good battery life, awful track pad.   I'm looking for something that has &gt;3 hours of battery life under heavy load, a good track pad, and isn't overly-delicate.

Appreciate it.",1,1585629984,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs6m54/best_laptop_for_mining_engineering/,pcmasterrace,1

By performing poorly I mean high RAM usage most the time at about 20% or 30% now this could be normal but I do think it sounds a bit high, running at 2133MHz even after I changed the Xmp-profile, and Windows is also saying I can only use 15.9 GB out of the 32GB now I have heard this is normal but I wanted to see if it is. I have no idea why my ram could be performing so poorly if someone could let me know that would be great.

As of a month ago, I've been having this problem with my PC (built myself, here's a link to all of my specs:  [https://gyazo.com/bfdd298ebcb43bc6de1297ce3f773865](https://gyazo.com/bfdd298ebcb43bc6de1297ce3f773865) ) That started off happening less frequently. While I would be in-game playing with friends (such as modern warfare etc.) My computer seems to stutter for about 3/4 seconds, with heavy frame drops and my inputs from my keyboard and mouse become unresponsive. This would happen every 5 minutes or so, but now it has become a system-wide problem with everything that I try to do, even typing this post right now, my typing would stop completely but all videos/music would play as normal, I can still control the mouse, but I'm unable to type/click anything, my mouse would drag across the screen if I move my mouse then stop, and even typing, nothing would appear on-screen while it stutters, and after it ends, all my text would appear on the screen. 

This has become a super huge issue, and I can't tell if there is a CPU problem because all of my system monitors show no spikes in performance (except when I first log in to windows) and windows is running on my Samsung EVO SSD, it's almost full, but my SSD has been almost full for forever and I doubt in my mind that my pc is running like butt because it's almost full. Does anyone have any ideas? I tried doing a full virus scan on my computer and nothing suspicious shows up at all. I recently cleaned out my rig of dust to see if there were any thermal issues that were causing the stuttering but alas, no solution has come across me.

 I'm not sure if I should do a factory reset of windows, as I have no way of obtaining an external hard drive to back up my stuff. Any suggestions would be amazing!

So um, my old laptop I got in 2014 and it was cheap (around 300$ I think) and through the years and getting dropped it's pretty bad. I wanna get more into digital art more but its kinda glitchy, prone to crashing and can only really run sai (and not that well either. 

I'm also kinda jealous when I see someone else's computer and they can have like 12 tabs open on a browser no problem. 

I also kinda wanna play more steam games? Like, I'm not quite interested in playing the top graphic games, but like any game I download (I've mainly downloaded MMOs, Sprite-based, and fighting game) lags/drop frames real bad after some time. 

I originally was thinking of buying something around the 750 price range but I can probably save money for something that's 1k+ if I should get the best of the best.

fs4ylv,greenag,Subwoofer Audio Issues,"So I did some research into my issue and couldn't find much on my own. I figured I'd post here to see if anyone else has had an issue like this? 

My setup previous to my issue...

Computer, Receiver, TV, 2 tower speakers, and a sub

Everything worked fine in stereo and windows detected the sub and music was great.

I later installed a center speaker and 2 rear speakers

Now in 5.1 or Dolby Atmos, there is nothing coming from the sub when I'm watching YouTube or listening to Itunes, however Netflix manages to utilize it. I wouldn't mind switching to stereo when i want to listen to music or watch YouTube but it wont even detect the sub anymore under the stereo option.

I've tried the standard stuff like reinstalling drivers and making sure everything's plugged in.

fs48z8,dregwriter,Is there a test to check if your graphics card has defects??? Something for GPUS like the BIOS RAM and Harddrive test???,"I'm seeing way too many graphical issues in just about every game I play now, even games that ive played in the past with zero issues but having issues with now.

Random crashes, game freezing up, weird artifacting on display, picture suddenly stops showing up correctly after sessions of play(^(bottom half of display appears at top of the screen and top of the display appears on the bottom half of the screen))

&gt;**For example**: in **Wastelands 2**, the game would look like its frozen since, anything on screen is not moving nor responding, but yet, I can still hear the characters walking, the sound of the menu opening up, and can even save the game while in that state by just memorizing where the save is at on the menu.  
&gt;  
&gt;In **Skyrim**, the game just randomly freezes, and the windows circle loading icon appears, and then the game becomes unresponsive and I have to kill it via task manager, and when I do that, the desktop has some weird looking graphical artifacting going on, and when I load skyrim again, thats where the picture gets cut in half and display both halfs on the opposite side of the screen, top and bottom. I have to hard reboot my computer because the desktop and windows 10 UI looks like there's square boxes cut out of it, giving everything a pixel look.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Division 2**, theres weird small black boxes keep appearing and disappearing really fast, so fast that you cant really catch it with your eyes, all you really see is the aftermath in your side vision, Its like trying to stare at individual falling rain drops, thats how fast they appear and disappear all over the screen. Can barely see them unless I stare at the white sky. and sometimes the game will [turn completely white with a pitch black sky](https://i.imgur.com/RN2AA70.jpg) and stay like that for a few second before turning back to normal.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Destiny 2**, the same as division but instead of black boxes, its white sparkles of light, I even see these during loading screen along during combat. its like full time fire work going off in the background and its barely visible, but on screens where the colors are solid, you can see it really well.

There's way more examples from other games I play but you get the idea

And im pretty sure its my graphics card, reference GTX1080, stock, no OC. I bought this like a month after its release date. I think this shit is on its last legs.

But I dont know of any test that checks for defects to be sure. I only know of GPU performance test for FPS, temps and such.

Do any of you know know of any GPU failure/defect test???",3,1585620140,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs48z8/is_there_a_test_to_check_if_your_graphics_card/,pcmasterrace,1

fs47bb,PersonSuitTV,ASUS XG17AHPE Portable Display Review,"The long awaited XG17APHE is finally available for purchase. I have spent some time getting to know this new display and wanted to share my review. Let‚Äôs get started.

Specs:
This display features a 17.3in 1080p screen operating up to 240Hz. Featuring up to a 3ms response time and adaptive sync (G-Sync/FreeSync). RGB coverage of 100% and 300nit brightens. Mini HDMI, USB-C for display &amp; power and another USB-C dedicated for power, headphone jack &amp; front facing speakers. It packs a battery rated up to 3.5 hours of use on a single charge. It comes in at 1060g or 2.33lbs and includes a cover that doubles as a stand.

Display:
This display is honestly gorgeous. Mirroring the same image from my 16in MacBook Pro display it was surprisingly close to the same level of quality (minus the resolution of course). They pre-calibrate each display before shipping it and provide you with a sheet with what it is actually rated at. My display was found to cover 98.8% of RGB with a .72 delta and gamma of 2.18. While it maybe 1.2% off from 100% it‚Äôs still providing a stunning picture and you would be hard pressed to ever notice that.

This display was the first time I have ever seen 240Hz in action. To be fair it‚Äôs not as big as the jump as 60 to 120/144 was but the image is just so much clearer during fast motion and I could definitely see it gaining a slight edge in fast paced games. Doing the UFO test I found the overscan was very light at max level and could not notice it until I took a picture during the test. I ran Overwatch at 240hz over USB-C without any issues and the adaptive sync worked like a charm. I also connected my Switch via HDMI and worked beautifully.

Before I owned this display I purchased the MB16ACE. This display was half the price and almost a full pound lighter. I was worried when I got the new display I would regret my purchase because of these reasons until I put them side my side. The color accuracy alone sold me. It‚Äôs not that the other display was bad, but it was no where near the image quality of this one. With everything this monitor offers it‚Äôs a clear winner over any of ASUS other portable monitor solutions.

Sound:
This unit features front facing speakers. The volume can get decently loud but if your are pairing with a gaming laptop the fans could overpower it when under load. The quality is not that great. There is no bass and it sounds very tinny. It‚Äôs passable in a pinch when your on the go but if you are using with a laptop your probably better off just using its speakers instead.

Battery:
This unit claims it can do 3.5 hours of battery life on a full charge. To test it out I connected it to my laptop and fired up Netflix. It‚Äôs running at 1080p and set to 240Hz in the OS. I set it to the sRGB preset as it has a preset level of brightness and is the setting to achieve the advertised RGB coverage rating, turned off charging and did not use the displays speakers. After having it run though several episodes of Braking Bad in full screen it lasted for 3hours &amp; 52minutes before shutting off. This was great to see and really solidified this as a great mobile solution.

Case/Stand: The case/stand works ok but does have some minor issues. When using it as a stand it has multiple magnetic points on the back giving it a good variety of viewing angles. However, it is held on to the unit itself by a magnet that could have been a little bit stronger. This can be a problem if you try to tilt it too much in a straight up position past the magnetic points it could detach due to added pressure. As for a cover its just ok and only held on by a very weak magnet.  it‚Äôs not a horrible solution for this and it does get the job done for the most part but just some things to consider when using it.

Conclusion:
If you‚Äôre looking for the largest portable display on the market that has great color accuracy, amazing refresh rate and works great for both gaming and productivity, this is definitely a great choice. Everything about the display promises amazing viewing wherever you go and the battery means you don‚Äôt always need to be near power to use it. The sound leaves much to be desired and the stand could have had a stronger magnet, but as long as your using it as intended your display will stay safe.",3,1585619969,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs47bb/asus_xg17ahpe_portable_display_review/,pcmasterrace,1

The other day my brother and I were playing a game together when his computer suddenly shut off without warning. When he pressed the power button to try and turn the computer back on, the power button LED lit up briefly and then shut off. Also, the case fans turn about a 5th of a turn and then stop. Some RGB and LED elements turn on inside the computer, but nothing else happens. As I mentioned in the title, we replaced the PSU and the computer still presents with the same symptoms. I'm going to do my best below to summarize the hardware.

&amp;#x200B;

GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 950.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 of some sort. I can't remember exactly which model.

MoBo: Some sort of Asus STRX, about 2-4 years old, if that helps.

PSU: Powerspec 650 bronze semi-mod.

Don't remember what brand the RAM is, but I believe its 16 GB DDR4.

Storage is a Tb SSD.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry I can't do much better than that right now. I built this computer about 4-5 years ago and recently gifted it to my PC-challenged brother.

But I wanted to step it up, I saw many threads about the DT 770 Pro and apparently they are very good for the money, but i have a few questions:

I game a lot of the day while i'm not at work, usually CS:GO, PUBG, MW, Arma 3, and other non-fps games, apart from that I do listen to music often, usually grime as I like the high bass,

Are the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pros good for gaming? mostly for the titles above, and will it be a decent upgrade from my Razer Kraken Pro V2's?

I'm looking for clear and high quality sound, so i can hear footsteps well, and tell everything apart. and for the music the same thing, with nice bass which I heard these provide (I'm not a bass head)

And i checked online and these headphones were made a long time ago, surely newer headphones will be better due to better technology?

fs25v0,Thatrealthing,RAM Replacement Led to No Display,"I decided to upgrade from my Corsair Vengeance 2x4GB DDR4 3000MHz RAM to its 2x8GB DDR4 3200MHz equivalent. But after slotting the new RAM in, I noticed that my monitor was displaying nothing apart from a No Signal, and my keyboard wasn't turning on anymore (the backlighting turns on together with the PC normally).

I switched the ports from the original A1B1 to A2B2 with the new ram and still, nothing had changed. Knowing that my displayport cable can be dodgy at times, I hooked the PC up to the TV via HDMI that I plugged into the motherboard (I tried this with both the GPU slotted in and also completely taken out) and still, no signal. 

I also attempted going back to the old RAM, in both A1B1 and A2B2  configurations, and those were both tried on the TV and the monitor. 

I then tried to reset the CMOS by taking it out for 5 minutes and putting it back. I tried this yet again, on both the TV and the monitor, with both RAM slot options. I literally even got so desperate as to trying to clean out the ram slots out of any dust that there may be, and even started flipping the RAM sticks about.

As I was doing all of this, I shut down the PC fully (power button held in for ~5 seconds until it shuts down), power supply turned off and taken out and I waited for the green shutdown light on the motherboard to go dark, too. 

It is probably worth noting that as I replaced the RAM sticks the first time, I also took out the GPU for a clean of its PCB with a soft unused toothbrush, brushed gently over the surface. 

I don't know if I'm being an absolute idiot and am missing something, but I'm completely out of options and I am so lost as to what the hell I could have done wrong, or not done?

If anyone has any ideas, please help me out. And please feel free to hold me to scrutiny over what I've done already, in case I missed something.

fs21t6,maddix30,My struggles upgrading an amazon prebuilt,"DISCLAIMER: I understand not many people will be interested in this so I suggest to just read this if you're bored at 1am.

So around 2 years ago I bought a prebuilt from Amazon with the hopes of upgrading it to be a decent budget system. It had an i3 2120, gtx1050ti and 8GB of ddr3 1333MHz Ram. 

A couple weeks ago I bought an RX580 8GB OC and an i7  2600. Both arrived with no issues. I first installed the CPU (as it was second hand) and it worked fine. Miles better than the slow I3 I had before. Anyway so after installing the RX580 there was an issue, no display output. None of the 5 ports would give any signal. The LED indicator showed no signs of errors. 

So after 1 night of reddit and forum browsing I narrowed the issue down to either card fault or an outdated Mobo bios. I didn't want to return the card so soon so I went with flashing a new bios. Long story short after the second flash the mobo  was done for. I got it to boot on troubleshoot mode but windows wasn't playing well. 

So now I've ordered a ryzen 7 2700x and an Asus B450m  as well as 16GB of 3200MHz ddr4 ram. Quite disappointing I killed the system but at least compatibility with newer hardware shouldn't be an issue.

Anyway that's my story folks. If you actually read it then you must be pretty bored.",5,1585611876,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs21t6/my_struggles_upgrading_an_amazon_prebuilt/,pcmasterrace,1

fs1yoe,tangosierraecho,Computer just stopped running (dead CPU?),"Hey all,

I built my computer many years ago and it was running fine until today.  The last 2 weeks I  was running Folding@Home on my computer. Last night, I overclocked the CPU and GPU which was working fine all night.  This morning, I remotely accessed my PC and restarted it, but it never reconnected. I thought that maybe I had just hit ""shut down"" instead of ""restart"". When I got home, I see that it was actually stuck in the boot screen.  I powered it off and restarted it. It got all the way to booting up windows and gave me the blue screen of death after I logged into my windows account.  I tried powering it on again and it got so far as to letting me log in and then crashed.  This happened several times before it just stopped.  

Now when I power it on, the fans start up for 1-2 seconds before the whole system powers off and then the fans power back on but that's all that happens.  It will just sit there like that.  The motherboard does not beep. The only thing that is different is that the CPU LED on the motherboard is lit red (which I don't believe was there before).  The motherboard panel reads ""Cd"".  I tried looking around online for solutions, but it was all for people who had just completed their build

Is the problem with the CPU? motherboard? PSU?

fs1rte,Boxfulachiken,Messed with refresh rates and Warzone is unplayable now on 9100f and rx 580,"I was getting steady 100fps on 720p render on warzone with a 9100f and rx 580 then I screwed with settings outside the game to try and fix the refresh rate of my second monitor and I started up warzone and got absolutely horrible stuttering. now the cpu is getting clocked to 100 the entire time and the framerate is moving between 60 and 140 but above that the game is just freezing every few seconds especially in the warm up around like 100 people and the sound stutters every few seconds. AMD radeon settings is saying the average fps was 14 and the framerate average was like 24ms and was jumping to almost 50 I think.

Whenever I have something moving on my second monitor like a video or twitch it's limiting my primary monitor to 45 Hz and I think the second monitor is running at that despite the monitor setting and windows settings saying it's running at 60 Hz.

I was messing with the refresh rates and flicked HDCP back and forth and a few other arbitrary settings like fast start up and that was pretty much it. I loaded up Warzone and it went from perfect to unplayable just like that and I've put all the setting back to what they were and it's still basically unplayable now.",0,1585610879,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fs1rte/messed_with_refresh_rates_and_warzone_is/,pcmasterrace,1

Any recommendations on how I can get the other 2 screens to work? The laptop has in total 1x miniDP, 1x HDMI, and data only USB C 3.1, and a plethora of USB A 3.0 ports.

fs1a72,thegamer93,To upgrade or not to upgrade... thats the Question,"Here is the Story of my PC Build and maybe you can help me, finding a decision on what to upgrade next.

So i sold my Skylake System and bought an HP Omen Gaming Laptop with RTX 2070 Max-Q and I7-8750H. Afterwards I regret selling my Skylake System with mit beloved Zotac 1080 Amp Extreme and my NZXT H440 Case. However I bought a cheap RGB-Mirror Case and I like the look of it. It is the Inter-Tech M-908 and it looks like this: [https://image1280.macovi.de/images/product\_images/1280/1215394\_1\_\_8829430-1.jpg](https://image1280.macovi.de/images/product_images/1280/1215394_1__8829430-1.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

I had some Hardware laying around which I bought for buying my Family a new PC, which they ditched for an family Laptop. So instead of selling those Parts I used them for my new Desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

So  I already had:

\- i5 9600k

\- GeForce GTX 1070 Mini ITX 8G

\- Noctua nh-l9x65 Cooler

\- Samsung 960 **EVO** MZ-V6E500BW 500GB NVMe Drive

\- 3TB Internal HDD

\- be quiet! Pure Power 10 700W

\- Kingston HyperX Fury HX421C14FBK2/16 16GB  Kit (2 x 8GB) (2133MHz)

then I bought an  Gigabyte Z390 Aorus Pro as ATX-Board as the Build was meant to be an ITX Build (for Family) first.

I play in 2560x1080 and I think until the next RTX oder RX - Generation of GPUs my GPU should be enough right?

**Questions:**

Some recomendations for an CPU-Cooler (No AiO) ?

I want to OC my CPU to 5 - 5.1 GHz, with 4,7 GHz it is throttling because of high temps.

Maybe Alpenf√∂hn Brocken 3 (is this a thing internationally or is this some german thing) ?

I want to save some money and on holiday season I will buy myself a new GPU + new 1440p or 4k Screen with 144hz. Would you guy change something before upgrading the GPU? Many people say, the i5 9600k is perfect for gaming. No need for the i7 or even the i9.

&amp;#x200B;

fs13oz,Johndole25,"Sever stuttering in all online games, have done everything to fix including replacing PC's","I stutter in ALL games online, Nothing I do has fixed the issues, over 3 years of trying to play PC games.

The stutter represents frametime spikes not rubber banding but don't seem to happen in offline titles.

I have build my PC twice from the ground up and no matter what I do games like Rust stutter constantly. In fact any online game I play stutters all the way. People tell me they have no stutters on the same hardware. For example a new game Last oasis (when the server weren't  down) I was playing with a group of 10+ people and they all said it was smooth. For me it stuttered horribly. It makes gaming so unenjoyable and frustrating. 

Things I have done:

1. Upgraded GPU

¬†2. Upgraded CPU

3. RAM

4. Installed numerous versions of windows cleanly with no other programs running than game testing. Over 20 Different windows installs

5. Used numerous SSSd's and HDD's.

6. DDU'd Numerous NVIDIA drivers.

7. Upgraded Router and changed ISP.

8. Tried advanced steps like disabling HPET ETC.

9. Limited FPS so not to CPU bottneck

10. Tried all setting low and high makes no difference

11. Tired a 4g connection from my mobile using a bought wifi adapter

Don't know what to do and at this point, all I want to do is play while everyone is home bound, but cant because of constant stuttering, getting really depressing and gaming is an outlet for me.

What's strange is that offline games seem fine. it's just online titles that lag and I have used a 4g connection to no avail.

The issue: Sometimes, my PC will crash. The video and audio freeze on the current frame and some corruptions appear. After this, the PC reboots automatically. After rebooting, it seems more likely to crash.

What I've tried: I have reinstalled the GPU, RAM, and PSU, and updated my GPU drivers and Windows.

Things to note: 

1 - The problem appears to be thermally related, as it usually happens during games then in greater frequency after the first crash, but my GPU temperatures are never higher than 50c, and usually not higher than 40-45c.

2 - Occasionally, the PC refuses to boot properly or doesn't have video output until I wait for a few minutes.

3 - Sometimes after crashing, it corrupts/resets the current lighting profile saved on my keyboard an reverts to the default.

Using a HyperX C2 Alpha with my pc, it doesn't pick up on the mic (using discord to test) unless I run it through my xbox controller. Interestingly it doesn't even pick up on my wireless headphones mic, both the mics have been tested with other devices and work fine. The HXC2 Alpha uses a single cable instead of a splitter, I'm worried that this could be causing the issue but I'm unsure how to fix it, tried it in my front and rear headphone ports both of which are connected, haven't used it in the microphone ports because the headphones don't emit sound if I do that.  


Any and all help would be appreciated because I don't want to replace perfectly good headphones, especially if buying ones with a split line doesn't end up fixing the issue

fs09nl,octillery,[RANT] CyberPower PC nightmare - 4 months and $2000 later - still no working PC.,"The worlds weirdest issue (sound on and look at the mouse light) [https://imgur.com/a/VZi8Ooi](https://imgur.com/a/VZi8Ooi)

For xmas, my boyfriend wanted a new PC, so I gave him some cash and he picked out what he wanted.(He deserves it times a billion.) He found a deal on CyberPower where they prebuilt the PC, and while we are both technically saavy and I have built my own PC before, having it prebuilt with custom parts seemed convenient so we gave it a shot.

We ordered around xmas, and PC arrived Jan. 22nd. Worked fine initially, then after 2 days, black screen, no graphic output. I popped my graphics card in and it worked fine, we RMAd the PC per their request because they wanted to test all the components . Fair enough, we shipped it out on the 27th after some back and forth about a return label after the 48 hour waiting period, so we shipped it as soon as possible.

We received it back February 18th, they had replaced the GPU and confirmed that there were no other issues. Bad components happen, no problems, they had been pleasant and helpful, we were patient and understanding. No big deal.

Right away we noticed that when you touch the mouse, it would disconnect the mouse and the keyboard, and reset all the DPI settings and RGB setting for the mouse and keyboards. We tested the mouse and keyboard with 2 different PCs in the same spot, yes, we are silly gamers with too many PCs, I know, but very convenient for troubleshooting. We tried a half a dozen different peripherals, they all lost power when touched. Confirming that this was only on the CyberPower built rig. I wasn't hazarding my own components to troubleshoot anymore after I saw peripherals popping on and off like christmas lights.

We called on the 20th which they are denying but we have the phone records to prove it, as evidenced here, [https://imgur.com/a/HmrtAjT](https://imgur.com/a/HmrtAjT) . They brushed the issue off but after talking to my friend who is an electrical engineer it was clear that there was some electrical issues with the PC and it has already fried one component. They advised us to wear slippers to resolve the issue...ok guys.

We called again after a few days of the issue going on, because honestly it is incredibly annoying to have to redo all your mouse and keyboard settings every other time you physically touch it and since clearly something electrical was going on, we didn't want more cooked GPUs, even with a year warranty.

So we sent back on the March 2nd (Got the label on Friday 28th, they are claiming we didn't report the issue soon enough, but our call logs and the tell a different story. )

We recieved it back March 28th, Friday. It still had the exact same problems. They said they replaced the motherboard and the ram, we confirmed because we took a pic of the serial numbers and the ram was a different type entirely.

We called today and talked to ""Eddie."" I don't know if he was having a bad day, but he wasn't on par with the previous techs we spoke with, he refused to believe we were having an issue, said it worked fine there, so we asked for a refund. He said since we failed to report the issue within 7 days (we did and you recommended \*\*slippers\*\* but ok.) That a refund wouldn't be possible. I asked for a higher up, he refused, and he refused to give us a name of a supervisor to reference in our email to the dispute center. Okey dokey. Guess we'll call back???

Great. So we are stuck with an electrical mess and out almost 2 grand, 4 months later. Honestly my boyfriend just wants a working PC to play Doom Eternal on but I guess that's too much to ask, and I feel like a shithead because he got me something awesome that I love and his gift has been an expensive bust

If not any advice for getting our money back? They said we can email their dispute department but I feel like we are really getting shafted here.

This does not happen all the time, but when it happens it will be for 30/40 sec.

This is happening more and more, and I don't know what the issue is.  
I already checked every device on the network, but this can't be the problem because I limited everyone to just 1 Mb/s (just to check) yet it's still happening (I've got 100 up and 100 down).

The only things I changed in the router settings is enabling UPnP and changing the DNS server.

This is what the developers say about the icon I get in-game (connection icon):

"" The connection icon appears when you are experiencing packet loss or latency instability (for example, when some of your packets are being redirected on another internet route). When this icon is triggered, you can experience rubber banding, hits being rejected by the game server, and abnormal induced latency. The probability of experiencing those situations is far higher when the red icon is visible. ""

I pinged my own gateway and [google.com](https://google.com) but both of them show 0% packet loss

In MAME, it seems that in general single thread performance matters more than overall CPU / multicore benchmarks.  It also seems that the GPU does make a difference especially when it's offloading the built-in GPU.

Is there a more comprehensive measurement of CPU and GPU or HW configs especially if you want maximum MAME performance?   MAME bench's i7-6700k is already 5 years old.

Single threaded CPU performance:  https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html

When my PC is in idle or I do some easy work/browsing etc, the chassis fan is slow and quiet. When I play some games for a while, the fan speeds up. So far so good.
But the problem is, it never goes back to slow speed after I stop playing the game. It doesn¬¥t matter how long I wait. But it returns to the slow speed the second I reboot the pc.
I tried MSI afterburner but it didn't help me.",8,1585603023,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frzgfv/fan_speed_keep_at_100_for_a_loooong_time_after/,pcmasterrace,1

I mean, a motherboard usually has 10 layers, which means layer 2-9 are internal and arent visible but contain a shit tone of tiny thin copper traces that potentially could break from all that flexing...WHY DO THEY BUILD ON TOP OF THE CARDBOARD CASE?! It makes no sense having the motherboard (or any pcb) on a non stiff surface while adding vertical force to it.

frxm8o,MTXjunkie,EKWB ‚ÄúCustomer Support‚Äù,"[Pics and Email](https://imgur.com/a/bblSPMA)

TL;DR
EKWB told me to submit an RMA, immediately denied it, and then told me they were sorry they gave me the wrong information and go back to PPC‚Äôs

Full version
I purchased a large amount of EKWB parts to build out my Corsair 1000D from PPCS on 3/16/20. When I got the parts in, I noticed an issue with the finish on one of the STC Torque fittings. I created a post in r/watercooling to get an opinion on the fitting. I received a few comments, but none that seemed helpful. 

So, I messaged EKWB on Instagram (3/18/2020). I did not get a response to the DM and initiated a ‚ÄúCustomer Support‚Äù inquiry the next morning. This request included in the second sentence WHERE I bought the fitting. I received a request for pictures of the fitting (3/24/20). Following my reply with pictures, I received an email stating that I should initiate an RMA request (3/25/20). 

I complied and filled out the RMA form, tracking down all of the necessary information and was instantly denied. I received an email within the hour that I need to contact PPCS. 

I explained that I was told to create the RMA and that I had done everything that was asked of me. I was then told that they appreciate my compliance, but I needed to contact PPCS. Several other emails were exchanged, including another employee being copied into the chain of communication. The communication just ended. 

Around the same time, I received a comment on an Instagram post from the EKWB account. That lead to a series of DM‚Äôs and an offer for the person to pass this along and get it resolved. The person stated that I should receive an email today, 3/30, in regards to resolving the situation and to follow up with them as soon as I had further information. 

I did not receive an email regarding the solving of this situation. I received a reminder that I did not provide feedback on my satisfaction with the handling of the situation (3/30/20). I submitted my reply, obviously a less than satisfactory reply, and was greeted by a reply telling me EKWB was sorry that I had received such poor Customer Support, but I needed to contact PPCS. 

I did reach out to the EKWB Instagram account, as requested, and they were responsive again. They apologized and asked for another chance to try and reach out to a higher up to resolve the issue. The results have yet to be seen. The EKWB Instagram manage has gone WELL above and beyond the entire time. 

This is totally unsatisfactory, in my opinion. EKWB dropped the ball in shipping out the product, they then dropped the ball by telling me to fill out an RMA, and they have continued to drop the ball by basically telling me that none of this is their problem. Let PPCS clean up our mess. That is totally unfair to PPCS. 

I have always heard negative things about EKWB, but I always took them with a grain of salt. However, after all of this hassle for an $8 part, I am done with EKWB. If they handle this situation so poorly, what will they do when I truly need their ‚Äúsupport‚Äù?",0,1585597140,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frxm8o/ekwb_customer_support/,pcmasterrace,1

The first one is the \[Samsung C27JG50\]([https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/6dfb143f](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/6dfb143f)),

The other one is the \[Samsung U28E590DS\]([https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/b20e44](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/model/b20e44))  


As you can see these are two similar monitors, yet very different. The first one is a 2k monitor with 144Hz refresh rate, and the other one is a monitor that has a 4K resolution but it only has a 60Hz refresh rate.  


From my viewpoint, there are a few very important factors. These two monitors are not really expensive. Right now both of them are around 250$ where I live. The thing is that I don't have a really good pc right now that could run anything at 4k, neither in 144fps, just a laptop with a GTX 1050Ti and a mid-range CPU. Since I kinda lost my job because of the pandemic (I only get 20% of my salary which is enough for buy the basic things, and live my life) my plans about buying a real gaming pc got delayed for god knows how long, but I really want to entertain myself while sitting at home for months, so I decided to buy a PS4 Pro, which could use the 4K, but not the 144Hz. Another point for the U28E590DS.  


But there are a few points for the other one also. \[Here\]([https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/comparison/8dba7cd95](https://www.displayspecifications.com/en/comparison/8dba7cd95)) is a comparison between the two monitors. The reason for the 2K monitors are (with decreasing importancy ranking) :

1.) I'm still planning on a high-end gaming pc, which would definitely benefit from a 144Hz monitor.

2.) Better response time

3.) Curved screen

&amp;#x200B;

Please help with some advice, I'm not very experienced in these things, since I never played in more than 60fps and in more than 1080p.",10,1585595615,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frx45l/can_you_guys_help_me_decide_which_monitor_should/,pcmasterrace,1

And my mistake was that I opened up one of those top RAM holders on my motherboard, and then when I put it back in place, put my old GPU back in place, and turned it on. 
It started, but the monitors didn't turn on, my mouse and keyboard didn't turn on, and my headset didn't turn on. I connected them directly to the motherboard, nothing. Monitors on the GPU didn't fix a thing. Both monitors I checked to see if they were on when plugged in and they kept giving me no signal.

I've tried everything but the only temporary solution I have is to switch to 60Hz and then back to 120 or reboot.

After some research I found out that I can switch to a mode (MSHybrid) that makes the iGPU appear in device manager and the display is now handled by it. I want to switch to that mode and see if it solves anything but I have no idea how to, it doesn't appear as an option in the BIOS.

I have a desire to use Linux as the main operating system.

But at the same time, there are apps that only work under Windows, and I can't stop using them (Wine doesn't offer).

I decided to use a virtual machine.

On Windows, I've repeatedly used a virtual machine. VirtualBox, Vmware. And I noticed that there is a delay during work. Minimal, but it's present.

My friend uses Linux with a virtual machine. He says he doesn't have a delay.

Installed Ubuntu 18.04, installed Virtual Box. But the delay is still present!

My question is:

Is it possible to use a virtual machine without delay?

fru87z,angry_dingo,Looking for the best RGB fans and controller,"I'm collecting my parts for my new build and I'm going full RGB.  

The case is the Lian Li PC-O11DW although I can switch that to black if needed.  

The mobo is ASUS ROG Strix X570-E Gaming.

What I'd like is to add the best and most compatible RGB controller with eight fans.  Three intake, three exhaust, and two for push/pull AIO 240mm cooler.  If I go with a white case, I'd like white fans.

I'd prefer RGB fans that light up the outside circle but if I need to go with fans that light up the blades, that would be fine.

Thank you.",2,1585586548,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fru87z/looking_for_the_best_rgb_fans_and_controller/,pcmasterrace,1

frtlb6,Shade-Tone05,A Cheap Gaming Laptop?,"Hi everyone, I am a console gamer - and have been for over 10 years. I am becoming increasingly bored with some of the games I play and want something new.

I've been looking into purchasing a gaming laptop, and I am utterly astonished at how ridiculously expensive they are. All that I really want is to be able to the mod the games that I play - to breathe some life into them, but that is not something I can achieve on my consoles.

I need to make this clear - I do not give a single fuck about mental graphics and realistic frame rates. I want something that will run games at 30fps or better and something like 720p. Literally all I want is a parallel to console gaming, I want an identical experience - just with more freedom in my games.

Is there a gaming laptop that can consistently run games at: at least 30fps and with just better than discernible graphics - that will not cost me 1k?

frsrnq,seekingstars,"Lag after PC idle and sometimes random, freezes after logon","About 2 months ago I noticed lagging and audio crackles/stuttering that started happening at random times. Mostly noticable when waking after the display turns off from idle, but other times it will happen when gaming. A restart always solves the issue temporarily.

Specs:  
Mb: Gigabyte Z370 Gaming Wifi  
Gpu: Gigabyte AORUS 1060 6GB  
Cpu: Intel i5-8600k  
Ram: 2x8gb G.skill Trident RGB DDR4-3200  
SSD: 1tb SanDisk Ultra   
External HDD: 5Tb Seagate backup+  
External SSD: 500gb Samsung T5  
External soundcard: NI Komplete Audio 6  

Here's the progression of symptoms and what I've done to try to diagnose the problem. Sorry, this will be a bit lengthy:

Lagging &amp; visual/audio stuttering continuously sometimes randomly and sometimes after PC idle, usually worse when it occurs during gaming or OVR tracking.

Noticed high system interrupts during lag

Updated Windows (no fresh install) and updated graphics drivers (with fresh install)

Noticed stuttering only occurs in audio while using mouse, completing minor operations. Progressively gets worse sometimes and lags computer. Checked to make sure the computer was in high performance mode.

Checked system interrupts with WPR &amp; WPA. Found driver interrupts were coming from the windows NT kernel. Checked hard page faults, everything looked alright there.

Checked audio latency issues with my soundcard control panel. There were major issues reported there. Then I checked the audio stuttering using LatencyMon. The diagnostics there reported possible cpu throttling, power management, or bios issues. So I downloaded Intel XTU to check for throttling and found no throttling was enabled. Checked my PSU to find the eco switch was on, so I turned it off and rebooted.

Issues persisted. Updated my bios from AMI F1 to F15a. 

The stuttering is still happening after idle, my OVR tracking was awfully jittery after the computer had been on a while, and a restart fixed as expected. Now, my computer sometimes hard freezes after login. Win+Ctrl+Shft+B doesn't work here (thought it would since my GPU doesn't load the set led color, indicating a potential firmware issue), I have to hard restart. I also had an incident where I got a blue screen upon switching my GPU's LED setting. 

Anyone know what is going on here? It's very frustrating, and I don't know what my next steps are.",3,1585581842,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frsrnq/lag_after_pc_idle_and_sometimes_random_freezes/,pcmasterrace,2

Ideally, I want everything to be compatible out of the box so it saves me the most stress when building. Is this a good motherboard to get right to building, or should I choose another? What tools should I have on hand the day I decide to build it, and should I buy thermal paste?

I only plan to game and stream in 1080p 60fps with this PC, with minor editing. This is my first time ever building a PC so let me know if I should consider a CPU cooler.",10,1585581277,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frsljz/opinions_on_build/,pcmasterrace,1

frsidm,BelgianBillie,Issue with UD3900 and USB switch. UD3900 not showing up in adapter display after initial switch.,"I have a screen that i want to share between the Surface Pro 4 and my Desktop. The screen is plugged into the UD 3900 with a DVI cable and then i plugged the UD 3900 into a USB switch that goes to my surface and my desktop. My keyboard and mouse are also plugged into the UD3900.

When i start up the desktop (which has another separate screen) it goes into dual screen mode and everything works fine. When i then click the USB switch, the surface pro 4 recognizes the second screen and mouse/keyboard and everything is fine.

Then when i switch back, the controls and mouse moves over, but the screen remains stuck on the surface, or at least the visual gets stuck on the screen because the surface wont allow access to it anymore. The mouse and keyboard moves over to the desktop pc but not the screen.

What could be causing this issue?  


Additional:  When it is plugged in directly, the desktop recognizes the display adapter in device management. If i then plug it in through the USB switch it continues to work. If i press the USB switch to move it to the surface, it moves the mouse/keyboard/screen over. When i then press the USB switch to move it back to the desktop it moves over the keyboard/mouse, but not the monitor and the UD3900 does not show up in the device manager anymore.",0,1585580995,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frsidm/issue_with_ud3900_and_usb_switch_ud3900_not/,pcmasterrace,1

At first I thought it was my CPU (Ryzen 5 2400g), but that remains at perfectly safe temps during this process. Then I thought it was my PSU (EVGA 600W), then I felt like an idiot for not thinking it was my GPU, but now I'm questioning myself.

I do know that my GPU model's cooler has a bad reputation, but I couldn't find much other info online.

Any ideas?",10,1585579258,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frrzrx/overheating_help/,pcmasterrace,1

Heyo,  


I bought these headphones - [Sony WH-CH700N](https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-ch700n); with the purpose of connecting them to the following:  


**a)** my Windows 10 desktop, that has Bluetooth 4.0 capabilities by adding an Asus Adaptor (a stick)  
**b)** my work laptop (a Lenovo ThinkPad, also Windows 10)  
**c)** my iPhone 11  


Headphones works perfectly with **b)** my work laptop and **c)** my iPhone 11, but I can't connect them via Bluetooth to **a)** my desktop.  


My only issues are with **a).**  


They seem to connect via Bluetooth, it says Paired. at least that's what I see in Windows Sound Settings, but I can't select my headphones as output.  


When I try to connect them via the cable that has come in the package, it does connect to my desktop, but my microphone doesn't work.  


Any ideas on what to do? I'm stumped.

Forza loads up and is working fine. When I press continue, few seconds after, the clock of the GPU drops, % usage drops. The whole PC is working just fine, but the GPU just gives up like that.

frqw11,proicons,My thoughts on Consoles vs Computers,"This post is directly a revised copy-paste post from the Facebook Group based on the feedback and concerns i got in the comment sections. My revisions are with Italics and some with striked text for CLARITY. I haven't deleted anything it's all there. I will do my best to answer to any question you have. In the end this post get me banned but here it goes.  (**This is a long read if you don't want to read it it's ok you can move on**)

## This post is about PCs versus Consoles. If it doesn't concern you, you can move along.

I see so many posts about consoles being better than computers and vice versa.Consoles were designed to game while Computers are general purpose machines doing many stuff, one of them is Gaming.In order to compare 2 things that they are not the same you need to have a context. In which way you are comparing them. The obviously answer would be gaming. Let's grab on to this.

## TL;DR PCs gives you flexibility to fine grain your experience, while consoles rely on Convenience and Couch gameplay with friends and family.

## The technical part

First of all the latest consoles such as PS4 and Xbox One are x86 and are pretty similar to our current computers.Xbox One is using a specific-purpose Windows 10 operating system that it will run only UWP while PS4 is using a Unix FreeBSD Modified operating system.When a company decides on creating a Console they need to think about that cost of this console. After all is a stripped out PC that is designed for gaming.There's a balance. This balance is all about price to performance. They can't use high-end stuff because that will raise significally the price and at that moment you can make the argument of opting for a pc instead.Instead they opt out for mediocre *to low-end parts* and to balance that they rely on *software* optimizations.Truth to be told the hardest part of developing a game is optimizing it.When a Developer Company decides on creating a game for a console, most of them times won't do it from scratch. They have some sort of an engine. The development all takes place obviously on a PC and then they compile it for the said console everytime. At the early stages of development all the testing is being done on the PC (*because after all that's the purpose of a general purpose device. to be able to do more things than a specific purpose device like a console*), but when they reach the final version of the game they will try it out on the Console DevKit. The Console DevKit is a way more unrestricted version of the Console that gives the developers more freedom. They will probably have monitor*ing* tools, they can check logs and they can optimize the game to reach its full potential for the given hardware.This engine i mentioned earlier is the core of any given game. The engine dictates physics, mathematics, *graphic fidelity* and everything arround the game.When you develop a game with an engine for a Computer, this engine can't have any optimizations built-in because this game is not platform-specific. This game will be available to run on million combinations of hardware. So the developers have to make the known ""Graphic Settings"" so every player can chose at which level their computer operates the best, they need to have generic Optimizations. And in the end they can't optimize the said game for everyone. Is impossible to do.Developing a game for a console is a different story. The developers know exactly on what hardware this game will run and this hardware won't change ever. So there are really no settings you can mess with because the developers found the sweet spot of graphic fidelity and performance on that specific hardware and have already done this for you. Suddenly all players playing on that console have an optimized game and all are enjoying the full potential of this optimized game on that console. *That doesn't mean that their experience will be better than playing the game on a Computer.*If we want to make a direct comparison between a console and a computer we need to find similar hardware. In this test scenario we won't be dealing with the CPU. We will remove the CPU Bottleneck and we will focus on the GPU scenario. PS4 is using a GPU from AMD identical to Radeon 7870HD. A pretty competend card. If we try to make a computer running a solid i9-9900k with the 7870HD and try to run the games that co-exist in PS4 and PC, i bet you, the PS4 will outpeform our PC. Why? Because the game is optimized for PS4 and like i said the developers have found the sweetest spot. While this game on pc has generic optimizations that won't benefit you that much. But if you try to run the same game on a  Ã∂2Ã∂0Ã∂8Ã∂0Ã∂tÃ∂iÃ∂  *modern graphics card,* you will have a lot more graphic fidelity than what PS4 can output *with better performance at most times.*  
*Thing is that Computers have the flexibility of combining the right hardware tailored for you. You can pick exactly at you want and with the hardware you chosen play whatever you want with the performance this hardware can offer. This flexibility exists only on Computers.*   
*If you were about to leave out the convenience and price part, all-arround a computer would be a more solid experience than a console.*  
Computers are about flexibility while Consoles are about convenience.

## The Convenience part.

Well i have to admit i own both a really powerful computer but i also have my consoles as well. But why?While computers are great for gaming with many combinations of hardware for you to pick for your needs they are not convenient on a couch use. (I will come back to this later)if you see every console advertisment they have this scene that you are among friends playing on the living room on a big TV or playing with your family together.  
Consoles are deisgned for Couch use with an intuitive GUI(graphic user interface) that lets you navigate to every aspect of this console (at least what they allow you to do) with a controller. That's a big deal. You don't have to jump in on 5 different windows changing settings or firing up a console and typing commands to optimize something is not. Their R&amp;D team has invested a lot of time on this so you can have a great experience doing the stuff you need with ease. That been said it doesn't mean that you can't hook your favorite console on your PC monitor and jam from your desk.PCs on the other hand are designed for a general purpose usage. You won't find this fine grained GUI out of the box. Some might say ""hey dude there are several launchers like Steam Big Picture, Playnite, Retro Arch and other stuff like that that will allow you to navigate with a controller on a TV on a couch. **Yes there are**. But what happens if something breaks. Or something doesn't work like expected? You need to do it in the traditional way (navigating these windows, or typing some commands and stuff like that)While you can certainly build a computer to have on your living room and playing games (i have this already and whatever it can't play it streams is directly from my main build over a Cat6 UTP) it won't give you the convenience of managing everything directly from your couch. You will need to get your hands dirty and grab a keyboard and a mouse and deal with many sad situations. And that really costs a lot. It costs valuable time with your friends, at this time you could certainly be playing games with your buds and having a jam, having fun -- instead you grabbed a keyboard and you are trying to trouble shoot why the game is crashing at startup, or why is lagging af because your operating system decided to start an update (Windows) or because Proton hasn't be optimized for this game (Linux). While this won't be the case everytime you play. You will most certainly face issues. On a general purpose machine there will be always the unexpected factor that is a bomb waiting to explode to ruin your experience.   
*But what is this all about unexpected factors and stuff like that. A General Purpose Device such as a computer is doing a lot more stuff than a Specific Purpose Device such as console. A Computer is running many more services to enhance your experience all-arround not only for gaming and these services might be overhead and some may cause problems.At this time i want to say that i'm Software Engineer so i can really give my points down there.*  


*Many of the workflows i'm doing requires Virtualization. Some games don't like that. They straight out refuse to start because Virtualization is enabled,*   
*Some competitive games are using some AntiCheat Solutions that they rely on Hypervisor. Well virtualization runs on Hypervisor and anticheats don't like that either so they straight up gives you a short ""fuck off"" aswell.*  
*Let's say you own some games on different Game Platforms on a Computer (Origin, UPlay, Steam, BattleNET, GOG, Epic). If you decide on playing a game on Steam, and steam have some updates scheduled for you, steam won't start these updates because you are playing and it might affect your experience along the way, other clients though are not aware that you are currently playing and they will start this update procedure . If you are playing a simulator game that's not a big deal, If you are playing a competitive game this will most certainly ruin everything. You will panic because your movements would be one step per second, and you will try to find what is causing this so you can stop this.*  
*Other problems might appear with some broken dependencies. Some games fail to deliver some dependencies and you get errors like DirectX is missing, or Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages missing, .NET Framework missing and all of that in more cryptic messages than these i'm writing over here.*  
*OS Specific issues. Windows 10 is ""optimizing"" your network connection, this optimization is not in your best advantage though every time, so you have to turn it off (through your cmd), Windows 10 while it won't install updates instantly it will download them and it might do this while your are playing.*  


*On Linux there's a new initiative by Valve called proton that is based on the well established Wine. This tool allows you to play Windows games directly to Linux. This won't work always and it will require settings.*  
*There are many things that i can't think right now but All these things need keyboard and mouse to be configured, and it short-of ruins the convenience part of it. You won't face these issues with Consoles because games are designed to run on them.*   


*Yea bugs is a thing, but exists on both so can't have this as a point for either of them.*  


## Performance Part

*Well given all these points we can't overlook the performance. This is a whole new section i managed to reply on the comment section on my previous post.Console Convenience comes at a cost. This cost is not only measured in money.Like i mentioned on the Technical Part of this comparisson they are cutting corners to deliver an experience for everybody. While you could play any game on a console that supports it, doesn't mean you will play this game at its full potential. Sure they will optimize it to work best on these consoles but the ""best"" for the consoles is not the best for the Computers as well. In order to play all the latest AAA games they will have to cut down graphic fidelity and framerates. PS4 for example the standard version plays everything on 30 fps on pretty average graphical settings. That's because like i mentioned to keep the cost low so you can afford it they had to use mediocre to low end hardware, but they managed to streamline a better experience on that given hardware so everybody can enjoy the games they want to enjoy even though they won't be playing them at their full potential. That's a compromise,*   
*The computers on the other part can have as much performance as you can afford them to have. The standards are changing slowly and you can hookup your brand new 2080ti with your old 2500k (you will have CPU Bottleneck) but boy, you can play a lot more games than your previous (980TI) in way better graphical settings.*  


## Cost Part

*Before we starting an uncessairy heated argument we need to think the other person in the room. Just because YOU can afford to build a computer and play at the highest settings doesn't mean that the OTHER person CAN. The world is not a fair place, some people the only they can afford is a PS3 and stick with it they won't upgrade to PS4 PS5 or a PC, you need to realise that everyone has no the economic capability of aquiring a high end system. A Console for them is the perfect tool for their job. They can play the games not with the greatest performance not with the greatest graphics but heck they can play it. Some perople genuinly enjoy the game for what it has to offer other than the graphic fidelity and high framerates.*  
*A console costs what it costs because they had an extensive research about Price-To-Performance and Optimizing their Software so they can accumulate as much as performance as they could.*   


*A Computer can cost anything and according to what it costs it can play games for it's price range.*  


## The conclusion part

I like to give this (in my opinion good) example about comparing these 2 different platforms. We have a Calculator and we have a Modern Computer, and you want  Ã∂tÃ∂oÃ∂ Ã∂hÃ∂aÃ∂vÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂ Ã∂sÃ∂uÃ∂mÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂ Ã∂pÃ∂rÃ∂oÃ∂dÃ∂uÃ∂cÃ∂tÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂fÃ∂ Ã∂nÃ∂uÃ∂mÃ∂bÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂sÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂rÃ∂ Ã∂gÃ∂eÃ∂nÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂lÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂nÃ∂yÃ∂ Ã∂aÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂tÃ∂hÃ∂mÃ∂eÃ∂tÃ∂iÃ∂cÃ∂ Ã∂oÃ∂pÃ∂eÃ∂rÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂iÃ∂oÃ∂nÃ∂  calculate some integrals or some advanced mathematic formulas. Which of these devices will do it faster? *Well a Good Calculator*  TÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂ Ã∂CÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂cÃ∂uÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂oÃ∂rÃ∂ because it was designed for this and this alone. Can you fire up Visual Studio on this calculator and start coding? No you can't , i t wasn't designed for that.  
*An admin had an issue with this example and i think it was the same admin that banned me so i will try to elaborate on that a bit more.There are several kind of Processors out there. There are General Purpose Processors (The ones your pc currently use) There are Application Specific Purpose Processors (Such as a GPU) there are Microprocessors and many more.*   
*When you are designing a device you need to have a context of what this device you want to do. A General Purpose Computer should do everything so you can get a General Purpose Processor. Can it game? Yeah but not well at all, that's why we got a GPU a processor made for playing games right? The GPUs are the reason we are playing games in the first place. (Note: the General Purpose Processors with Integrated Graphics Cards are General Purpose Processors with an Application Specific Purpose Processor built in inside)*  
*Lets get back to the Calculator example. When Texas Instruments or Casio design a Calculator, they don't use a General Purpose Processor. They don't need this flexibility that comes with performance overhead. They need an application-specific purpose processor that will do math faster.*   


*So if we know that a General Purpose Processor contains for example the 2 basic arithmetic operations ADD (SUM) and MUL(Multiply) this processor can do almost all the other operations by combining these 2 operations. But that will take more than one Processing Cycle (each Hertz is a Cycle)*  
*So in the end if we want to solve an integral on a General Purpose Processor it may take thousands of steps that's not true for the Calculator., You see they used an application-specific purpose processor that had this feature built in on the hardware side of things. So this operation will complete way faster than a normal processor would.*  
*Now the example is not perfect because it implies that a computer can't play games, which is not what we want to deduct, and while i said i will keep the original post and add things in italics i can say it was a fail example for the Current gen of consoles that are based of the same technology and architecture computers have right now. With the PS3 it would be valid. Because PS3 was using A RISC Processor, a way different processor than our modern ones, that till date can do some operations way faster than a traditional general purpose processor.*  
**Consoles** are designed to play games, and they are doing a great job at it *giving you the convenience of sitting on a couch with your buddies firing up the game you want and jam on your big tv*. It might not be always with the greatest graphics but most of the times it will run stable, and most surely have a good experience with it , But consoles are just it. Gaming.You want something more besides gaming? Y*ou want More from your gaming experience?, Do you want to push a game and your own computer to the Limits? You want raw POWER?* you want a **Computer.** You want both hey you can have them both. I have a computer, a media computer on my living room capable of playing some games and streaming from my  main pc, and a console, **they never got in a fight. Why would you?**",11,1585575283,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frqw11/my_thoughts_on_consoles_vs_computers/,pcmasterrace,1
frqv0y,InsaneFire10,New GPU help: RX 5600XT or RTX 2060,"I know that both of these cards perform pretty much equally, but one main thing is that the 2060 has Turing NVENC, while the RX 5600XT uses plain VCE.

frq4tw,Stevenson-15,Gigabyte GTX 1660 super fan curve help?,"Hi, I had created a custom fan curve for my gpu fans so that when the temp falls below 50, the card will stop the fans. i think passively cooled the gpu runs around 52-4 celcius with no heavy load. 

Some reason, when the temperature is between 49-50, the fans would ramp up and switch off and repeat a couple times

 I think someone said that happens when there isnt enought pwm signal or something but I made the fan curve either 0% or 25% for the first temperature node thing so that shouldnt be happening?

I prefer to run the fans off at idle to preserve the fan condition/health and reduce the dust buildup as it will be a pain to open up the card.

Can anyone suggest a better fan curve, much appreciated.

frp49k,Munzu,"High temperatures, what should I upgrade first?","I've only recently started to pay more attention to my temperatures since I started participating in the [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/) project during the night. I use CPUID HWMonitor to monitor my temperatures.

**Idle**:

* CPU: around 41 ¬∫C
* GPU: around 51 ¬∫C

Peak temperatures **under load** (folding@home):

* CPU: 89 ¬∫C
* GPU: 81 ¬∫C

&amp;#x200B;

This is my current configuration:   
[https://de.pcpartpicker.com/user/Munzu/saved/GKHYrH](https://de.pcpartpicker.com/user/Munzu/saved/GKHYrH)

* AMD **Ryzen 5 2600** (stock clocks and stock cooler)
* PNY **GTX 970** (all stock)
* **NZXT S340 Elite** case (stock case fans only, no additional fans)

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've tried:

* Clean off the dust: I've recently opened up my case and removed the dust as best as I could using compressed air, a slightly wet paper towel and toothpicks. 
* Removed front panel of the case in hopes of improving air flow. This didn't seem to help much, especially since I don't have any additional case fans installed.

Things I haven't tried yet:

* Changing thermal compound (I bought the CPU new at the end of 2018 and used the thermal compound pre-applied to the stock cooler)
* Use custom fan curves (haven't done much research on this and I don't know how to do it yet, plus I'm hesitant to do it because of noise)
* Buy a better CPU cooler 
* Buy more/better case fans

&amp;#x200B;

So my **questions** are:

* Sanity check: These temperatures *are* too high, correct? What temperatures should I be comfortable with?
* What's the first thing I should do/upgrade?

At first, I thought that maybe my CPU was overheating so I undervolted it by -100mv which gave me pretty good results (It was 86C at stress and it dropped to max 70C). But problem still occurs after 2-3 minutes of playing so I assumed that is not problem with CPU.  


Ok, so here is what I've already tried and it doesn't helped:  
\-Undervolting CPU  
\-Opening and cleaning laptop from dust  
\-Reinstalling GPU drivers  
\-Installing different version of GPU drivers  
\-Updating Windows 10  
\-Reinstalling whole system  
\-Installing game on another SSD  


I've also installed Afterburn and checked how it looks. I think temperatures are fine - GPU maximum 66C and CPU maximum 70C so i guess it's not overheated. I also noticed that when GPU usage is 99% everything is fine, game goes smooth, but whenever it hits 100%, FPS drops to 20.  


I don't know what else can I do üì∑ Any suggestions? Is it possible that my GPU is just broken? It was all fine till now...",1,1585567699,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frp2fx/gtx_1060_weird_throttling_issue/,pcmasterrace,1

frmrct,greenerdoc,Static pressure PC fan to pull air through HEPA filter? Anyone done it?,"Sorry, this is quite a bit off topic -

I am an ER doctor working in the front line currently. As we are running low on PPE (gowns, masks etc), I am trying to create a cheap PAPR (Personal Air Purifying Respirator) so I can see patients without wearing a N95 all day long (very uncomfortable and stinky since ive been using mine for 2 weeks).   

I am trying to see if I can use a static pressure pc fan to pull air through a HEPA filter through a  3D printed housing and pushes that air through a hose into a helmet.  It would be powered via an off the shelf battery source (ie: portable battery charger ideally or something like RC battery packs). I thought about PC fans because the are relatively cheap (and possibly low drain on power, although i dont know if this applies to static pressure fans).

A PAPR only requires 4-6CFM of air and most computer fans can generate up to 30CFM. The problem arises in finding a cheap fan that can pull or push air through a HEPA filter.

From my rudimentary research, it seems gamers in dusty regions have discussed using static pressure pc fans to pull air through a filter.  Has anyone actually done it?  Going one step further if this is possible, would it be able to modulate the speed of the fan to optimize air flow and battery use?

Thanks for any help in this - if this is not allowed, I'm sorry and please remove.",8,1585555559,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frmrct/static_pressure_pc_fan_to_pull_air_through_hepa/,pcmasterrace,1

frmlce,Ultra_Vee,Weird FPS drops in games please help!,"So I have had my laptop for about a year now and I have had this problem for the whole time that I have owned this laptop.

Lets start with the specs:

This is an Asus TUF FX505DU

* Ryzen 7 3750h with RX Vega 10 Graphics
* 32GB 2666Mhz DDR4 Ram
* GTX 1660ti 6gb 
* 512GB NVME SSD and 500GB 5400RPM HDD

So to explain this issue it is a problem where whenever I play games (usually graphically intensive ones), every 15 minutes or so my FPS drops to 5 FPS for about 6 or 7 seconds then goes back to running the game at the usual frame rates. During the FPS drop I monitored that my GPU utilization drops to about 3% and my CPU utilization shoots up to 100%, then once the FPS bug has stopped, the FPS shoots back up and and my GPU and CPU both go back to about 70% utilization each. 

Temperatures while gaming are at 80¬∞C  for the GPU and 90¬∞C  for the CPU and during the FPS drop the GPU drops to about 70 because of the utilization drop I'm assuming.

I have contacted Asus support about this problem about 6 months ago and they took my laptop to 'fix' it by replacing the cooling components, it seemed to work for about a week but then the problem started to happen again

Things I have tried to fix this:

* DDU Uninstall of both the iGPU and Dedicated GPU and reinstall the drivers
* I've tried only installing the Nvidia GPU drivers after a DDU of both GPUs
* I've tried only installing the AMD iGPU drivers after a DDU of both GPUs
* Cleaning the laptops cooling system
* Fresh install of Windows 10 Home
* Reseating RAM
* Reseating both the HDD and SSD
* Installed all the drivers provided by Asus 
* Disconnecting all peripherals 

Games that this problem can occur in:

* The Forest
* Grand Theft Auto V
* FiveM (this game gets this bug A LOT about every 30 seconds it happens)
* Minecraft (only with shaders)
* Fortnite
* Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
* Forza Horizon 4

More info: this laptop has 3 modes, turbo, performance and silent, all these modes control the clocks of the CPU and speed of the fans, all these modes also have the issue.

I want to try to see if this problem occurs on a different operating system, but I havent tried that yet.",4,1585554631,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frmlce/weird_fps_drops_in_games_please_help/,pcmasterrace,1

- Corsair Carbide Clear 400C Midi Tower
- Cooler Master B500 V2 KOMPLETT Edition
- Intel Core i5-7400 Kaby Lake processor

- Crucial DDR4 2400MHz 8GB
- MSI GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB Gaming X
- WD Desktop Black 1TB 3.5""
- Samsung 860 EVO 250GB SSD

Ive managed to replicate it on the sims as it crashes about 10 minutes into playing that.
When it crashes I've tried connecting my pc to the integrated graphics card instead of the GPU, but still no signal.

Symptoms-

Yesterday my pc stopped booting past the first beep ( gigabyte z87-ud3h Mobo, i7 4770 processor) . I decided to open it up and check. Upon popping open the cpu out of its socket, I found the pins to be a bit misaligned, with some thermal paste at some places, due to earlier attempts to get it on the cpu,  pic attached of the cpu socket ([https://imgur.com/a/urrH3bL](https://imgur.com/a/urrH3bL)). I need your help in order to find out how to get past this. Following are the possible resolutions i'd thought up to the problem-

1) Buy a new mobo with the lga1150 socket that the 4770 uses, if so, what would be a good alternative, to the gigabyte z87-ud3h? Does gigabyte still make these, and can i get them in India?

2) Fix the misaligned cpu pins, if so, how bad do you guys reckon the damage is, and how could i go about fixing/cleaning it up?

I appreciate any and all help I can get, this PC is 6 yrs old at this point, and holds quite the sentimental value to me, as I gamed my highschool away on this thing. What I wouldn't give to get it working again!

3700X

My issue is that I had the settings for overclocking turned on, with G-Sync enabled. I was able to get my D2719DGF to max at 155fps while at the desktop and 100+ in EFT while playing. For some reason while playing EFT, my dual monitor setup kicked the game to my portrait mode secondary display and ever since then, I can't get my Dell monitor to go above 60fps.

I have tried disabling G-Sync, turning off Overclock on the monitor itself. Restarting, and still nothing works.

Is this a sign of the GPU dying? It's never been overclocked, and it's only a few months old, so I could RMA it if needed.

frj757,sHaDovVz-,PC will not start after BSOD,"Hi Guys,

I was hoping you could help as I cannot figure out what is wrong with my PC.

I was on youtube and suddenly got a blue screen saying that something went wrong and it would restart. I didn't catch the code, but it never turned off to restart, so I held the power button down till it shut off, and now it will not boot back up.

When I hit the power button, the fans turn on, the ram sticks light up, the GPU lights up, so I know things are getting power, but the PC doesn't boot and nothing appears on the screen.

I have a gigabyte X570 Aurus Elite wifi paired with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600x. The PC has run perfectly fine for a month now, and I've done nothing to meddle with it physically. It just gave the error and I'm not sure if I messed something up by forcing the shutdown.

I have tried Qflashing the mobo, tried starting with 1 stick of Ram, I even removed the CPU to check if it was fried an it looked perfectly normal. Checked the mobo also for any burnt capacitors and it looks normal. Not sure what else I can do. 

I don't know why the hardware would have failed since it's all new parts under a month of use, and running perfectly normally. I am out of my 30 day return period on parts, and I don't want to have to buy new parts when I just got these. Any help or suggestions are appreciated on what could be wrong or how to resolve this.

I do not want to spend a ton, but I ve had some slight issues with dropped frames while streaming and the timeline does not play smoothly on Da Vinci Resolve when timeline resolutions set to 4K.

Do you think a Ram upgrade would be worth it?  Current Ram is 16GB 3200 as stated above.  My wife and I have identical computers, so I was planning on buying two sticks of 16 each, and give my 2 sticks of 8 to my wife so we will both have 32.

Ram will need to be white and RGB.

fri5id,someone-shoot-me,Reduced performance,"Hey guys, I got a question for you all. 
I have an old pc that is exceeded by modern standards, but, looking at its properties, it is still more than capable for most od the stuff.

The thing is, most of the time, it‚Äôs performance does not match the properties it possesses. In games for example (I use the pc mostly for studying and playing games) i used to have decent performance but now i have major fps drops, game takes some time to respond to my commands ( as if i have 200-300ms) in every game even if my internet is perfect. 

I used to open the task manager and keep the track of cpu and ram usage (i had 100% usage in league of legends and thats when my screen started freezing and stuff) but it seems normal (~50-60% for both ram and cpu in extereme conditions - i don‚Äôt play badass graphics games).

Can someone tell me what the problem might be. Why is my pc struggling to pull out more than 20 fps (in world of warcraft cataclysm (2012) i get even bigger delay on my commands, like half a second to respond to my movement).

Ive ran virus scans, disk defragmentations, i did change my screen from 1440x900 to 1920x1080 but theres no way it causes decent performance to become shit. 

I live in Serbia so most of my software is pirated :D but my windows is licensed. This problem bothers me for few years now, does anyone got any suggestions?

frhuvc,hyperhopper,Why do I keep getting random bursts of frame drops across all games?,"For the last few months I have been noticing random frame drops in all, or at least most games I play. These drops last for 3-10 seconds usually, and don't seem to be limited to any specific application.

Games will be buttery smooth most of the time, but then what feels like randomly, once or twice a minute, a drop in frames comes (seems like it often coincides with a lot of action on screen, but that could just be when I'm noticing it / getting bothered by it the most). All the games I'm playing are below my system's specs, and none of these games are maxing out my CPU/RAM/Graphics card.

Today when playing dota I decided to keep performance monitor open, and it appears that my cpu is dropping in usage that aligns with these framerate drops.

Picture: 

https://i.imgur.com/vzYd0pY.png

I have tried updating drivers, reinstalling drivers, different games, windows updates, making sure power settings are set to maximum performance. Nothing seems to help the issue. 

I would appreciate any help or ideas that anybody has!

frhri4,xT28arakanX,"Logitech mouse, keyboard &amp; headset upgrade","I don't know if this post is related to this subreddit, but I think you guys are more experienced than me at this. **Keep in mind I can only one buy thing, so I want to know which is the best option for me.**

&amp;#x200B;

**KEYBOARD UPGRADE**

Somewhere around January 2019, I bought the Logitech G213 Prodigy. The minimalistic design of it, the mechanical feel and the special keys (mute, sound leveling and anti-windows keys) made me fall in love with it. Even after playing intense osu!mania maps, I had zero problems, except one: it has an English layout.

This is an annoyance to me, because everytime I need to write something in Spanish, I have to change the system's input language (ENG to ESP). This caused a little bit of confusion at first, because when I pressed ***"";""*****,** it showed up as an ***""√±"".*** I got used to it, but I would like to stop changing the input language everyime (Windows key + Space). I also plan to give it a wayI also don't know what I should do with it if I upgrade.

The problem that has been explained above led me to think if I should upgrade and buy the Logitech G513 Carbon. Same minimalistic design, real mechanical feel, lightsync and a removable wrist rest (but no special keys, sadly).

I also need to mention that my country doesn't have the best economy, so I bought the G213 for $80 (it was like $60 on USA), and as of right now, the G513 is $160 (I think it's $100). I can buy it, but is it worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

**HEADSET UPGRADE**

I bought the Logitech G231 Prodigy for $40 four years ago, and it's the best headset I ever bought. It covers up all of my ears (can someone tell me the name of this type of headset?), and it feels more comfortable than any other headset I've used in the past.

The only problem is that the device that controls both microphone and volume levels is a little bit broken. Basically, if I touch it, I will only hear sound from one speaker (left or right), so I have to touch it again until I can manage to hear audio from both speakers again. I don't really know what happened to it, because I never threw this headset (I believe it has only fallen twice, but the speakers work with no problems). It's an annoyance that I'm also accustomed

Knowing this issue, I'm planning to buy the Logitech G432. I like it's colours, and considering the controlling device is no longer attached to the cable, it would solve this problem for me.

I need to add this as well: I bought the Logitech G231 for $60, and as of right now, the G432 is $135 (I don't know how much is it in the USA). Considering that this upgrade will solve my issue, is it worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

**MOUSE UPGRADE**

I'm not really sure about this, but I don't know if I should upgrade or not. Basically, I bought the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for $48 like five years ago. It gave me zero problems, excluding the double-click issue which is very rare. But, I have encountered external little issues, which I do not consider them to be a part of the mouse's problem (at all):

\- A lot of dust always concentrates in one place, and despite my efforts of cleaning both my table and the mouse's base, it doesn't go away. It's always in the same spot, and I don't know if buying a mouse pad will fix this.

\- My cable, a snakeskin type one, gets hard as a rock. I don't know what's the science behind this, but I can't manipulate it like a normal cable. Due to this, it adopted a shape and I can't change it back. I've seen some guys peel the mouse's cable, but I'm afraid I'll fuck up something so I'm not trying that. Any way to solve this?

Anyways, I've seen the new Logitech G502 Hero and Lightspeed version. Their shapes are a little different, almost unnoticeable, the actualized ***G*** logo, a meshed cable (thank god), a ten times better sensor as I've heard, and useless 16000 DPI. However, the Lightspeed version is wireless (and it can be used with cable too).

Right now, the Hero version is at $87, while the Lightspeed version is at $140. This is the latest of my priorities, so I'm not planning to buy one of this any time soon. Still, I want to know if the upgrade would be worth it.

I am right now playing COD Warzone but after about 1 game I get too mad to carry on playing so I quit and then find myself going back on it 10 minutes later. I really want to get into Warzone but I get way to angry or frustrated to play.

So theirs 2 questions in this Reddit. What games do you recommend for a fun experience and how can I stick to playing a game without rage quitting every 20 minutes :) Thank you",9,1585529811,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frh5yl/how_to_stick_to_playing_warzone_without_getting/,pcmasterrace,1

frh3h5,ButWhole95,What program can I run while gaming to force GPU to near-full load?,"Odd question, I understand. But, with the persisting issues with the 5700 XT's low clock speeds on primarily older games that dont strain the GPU, I want to experiment to see if this will possibly help. 

To describe the issue a little further:

Most of the older games that I‚Äôve played seem to run like shit, especially at 1080p. When GPU utilization isn‚Äôt at least like 80%, the clock speed will fluctuate heavily (as low as ~300MHz) and the performance will be straight ass. Which means, of course, that I can‚Äôt hardly play any old games at a half-decent performance. Borderlands 2 and GTA V, for example, run much better on my GTX 1060 6gb, which is pathetic. Destiny 2 also runs like shit. But, some games like Doom, Red Dead Redemption 2, Borderlands 3, CoD, and Wolfenstein II run phenomenally. This is apparently a very common issue among 5700 XT owners, and I honestly have no clue what to do at this point. 

Driver updates are evidently not going to fix this issue. So I am looking for alternative ""solutions"" before I decide to try to return it",0,1585529534,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frh3h5/what_program_can_i_run_while_gaming_to_force_gpu/,pcmasterrace,1

frgl15,Zeke_png,Having HUGE FPS drops - Fixes by alt + tab and then going back into the game,"Hey reddit, so me and my friend simultaneously happened to run into this issue about 2-3 months ago. Specifically in R6 siege, we‚Äôve had an issue where the game runs totally fine, for me personally I usually maintain 60 FPS with no drops at my preferred settings, and out of nowhere the game will drop to low 40‚Äôs, sometimes as low as mid 30‚Äôs until I tab out and then it fixes itself for about 20 minutes and then it happens again. I thought it was a weird issue until I found lots of old threads about other people having the same issue but with no posted solution that worked for me. 

My system:

Ryzen 3 1200
RX 570
16GB ddr4 @2667
120G ssd
1tb hdd

Latest drivers w/ multiple reinstalls and older driver attempts, locked FPS in game files as well as RTSS with no improvement, tried all sorts of different in game settings, reinstalled the game, pretty much most things you‚Äôd want to try with any FPS drop issue. Nothing has worked so far.

My friends system with identical issue:

Pentium G4560
RX570 
8gb ddr4 @2666
1tb hdd

Has tried most of the same things as me but to no avail. 

Since the only commonality in our 2 systems is our GPU I initially thought it was a driver issue with this card but after searching forums I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs been happening to people with a variety of cards from both AMD and Nvidia and I‚Äôm honestly just out of ideas.

frgdzw,Sinnedangel8027,Secret Labs Omega is horribly uncomfortable - Advice,"I recently bought a Secret Labs Omega chair and received it last week. I read the reviews and that all said its super comfortable and whatnot. So needless to say, I was excited to get this chair. I've been seating in this space seating chair for 5 years and its great but I figured it was time to treat myself and hop on the gaming chair shindig. 

So, I get it in and put it together (as frustrating as that backrest was to get on by myself) and I got to have my first sit. Its stiff but not uncomfortably so but its certainly not soft. That was to be expected. I didn't plan on working or gaming at my computer that day so I only sat in it for a few minutes. 

The next day though, I'm going to play Doom Eternal. I figure gonna be down for a long session so this new awesome chair will get a true run. After 2 hours, I notice my ass starts to hurt a bit like I've been sitting on the ground or a stiff wooden chair. I readjust, mess with the chair a bit and get back to it. A couple of hours later and now, not only has my ass started to hurt worse but now my lower back is starting to hurt. So I get up and take my dog for a walk, eat a meal, etc. Figure I'll take a break. Getting out of the chair was a relief to say the least. My back hurt a bit but it was nothing unmanageable. 

And after all of that, in my infinite genius, its time to get back to Doom. Within 45 minutes or so, the pain is back. I had read on the internet that it'll take some getting used to, so I push on through it. About 4 hours later, this pain is pretty intense at least to the point where I can't sit in this chair anymore. So I go to get up and holy shit does my back, cheeks, and tailbone hurt. I call it a night and hope that maybe I'm just stupid and sitting wrong so I'll try again tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and I sit down for some more Doom thinking that it'll be fine. I couldn't be more wrong, 2 hours in and I'm hurting again. 

Now for the record. I'm 5'8"" about 180lbs, I'm healthy and I'm not built like a potato. Nor do I have any issues with my back or anything of that sort. 

I could use some advice. Am I just stupid and sitting in this wrong somehow? I tried a seat cushion and it kinda helped for a little while, also tried with and without the included pillows. I don't see how anyone can say this is comfortable. I had my gal and my brother both sit in it for a couple of hours and they echoed the same issues.

TL;DR: This chair is awful to sit in and I'd rather sit on a wooden chair.

frfmhw,LandTrash,Some questions about gaming laptops,"Hello all,

I am looking to get a gaming laptop and have absolutely NO idea what I'm doing. I do know that desktops are the best options for gaming, however, I travel a lot and a laptop suits my needs the most.

I have come to a crossroads between two options and thought a more experienced person would notice the difference between the two:

* Option 1:  Acer Predator Helios 300 Gaming Laptop PC, 15.6 inch Full HD 144Hz 3ms IPS Display, Intel i7-9750H, GTX 1660 Ti 6GB, 16GB DDR4, 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD
* Option 2:  HP OMEN 15-dc1044na 15.6 Inch FHD 144HZ Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7-9750H, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (6 GB Dedicated) Graphics, Windows 10 Home

I am not willing to go above ¬£1300 and even then, this is a huge amount of money for me so I want to make sure I'm making the best choice. 

My main issue is deciding which has a better cooling system. I do know laptops are notoriously bad at keeping cool so I will buy a cooling pad in the future, however, in my mind having a good cooling system will ensure longevity as I do want this to last me many years. (my current laptop was 500¬£, 6 years old and still runs amazing so I have high expectations for a laptop that costs a kidney!)

Any advice would be much appreciated so thank you in advance!",6,1585524143,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frfmhw/some_questions_about_gaming_laptops/,pcmasterrace,1

The point to this post is that I still wanna be able to utilize my laptop when I‚Äôm on the go but it‚Äôs been way to slow compared to before.. it still runs games pretty good but typical things like starting it up and opening a program take so long now and I just don‚Äôt know why. Hard drive is packed to the max and I don‚Äôt have many programs on it and everything is up to date driver and windows update wise at all times. Any idea how I could speed it up and bring it back to life again ? Was think to bump the ram to 32 as it‚Äôs a single stick of 16 and to get a m.2 drive and maybe put the operating system on that but if there‚Äôs anything that won‚Äôt cost so much I would like to know !

frffd0,CaptDeadlift,RX 570 4gb or GTX 1070 8gb,"Hi guys , so I come with a question to you guys.
)I currently have a SFF build going on and have 2 GPUs at home (Zotac mini 1070 and a Sapphire RX 570 ITX).

Rest of the build consists of a R5 1600 @4.0 Ghz , 16GB 2866mhz ram for the important parts.

Tested both GPUs in the case (it has no ventilation to the gpu -raijintek metis-) and the 1070 under full load is at 82c while the rx 570 at 60-70c.

I don't really play new games (newest would probably be Rainbow Six) , mostly MMO like games (warframe , BDO and such) and none of the newer games seem interesting enough for my taste.

Should I stick with the rx 570 as it has lower temps , enough performance for my needs and cheaper to replace (I have a friend with a mining rig who can sell me couple of ITX 570s for 30$ in working condition) or use the 1070 in case I need something beefy for potential new games I might like.

Forgot to add that I game at 1080p 60fps and don't mind graphics settings. (Heard that the 570 is a perfectly capable GPU even in 2020 for 1080p)",7,1585523431,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frffd0/rx_570_4gb_or_gtx_1070_8gb/,pcmasterrace,1

It may actually be running at 633mhz, due to one having a lower speed than the other. Nevertheless, that number is nothing compared to today‚Äôs standards.

I‚Äôve been looking at upgrading to 16gb of 3200mhz DDR4 RAM, but my question is, how much of an affect would upgrading the RAM speed like this have on gaming performance? Thanks for your help guys

freok8,Integratedgrapes,My GPU died. Help me choose its successor.,"Hi PCMR.

Yesterday, my beloved GTX1080 finally died, and so I'm after a replacement fairly quickly, seeing as my partner also uses it frequently. I have a pretty hard and fast ¬£400 budget, and so far, I reckon my best options are as follows:

Option A: RX 5700 XT (for ¬£350 and shipping)

This gives me the best possible value for money, being able to run Doom Eternal at greater than 60fps at 4k, and offering an appreciable 10-20 percent improvement over my gtx 1080 in some games and after overclocks. I am aware of the driver issues, but sources I trust say these have been ironed out, and the price is right. My main concern here is that without ray tracing, I'll be missing out on some great features for the next few years and I won't be able to drool over Control.

Option B: RTX 2070 (For ¬£377 and shipping)

Having previously had a GTX 1080, no other RTX card is in budget or makes sense to me. Comparable performance to the 5700XT makes this an equally good bet for rasterised gaming and offers the great ray tracing features, but for the extra thirty pounds or so, I question how much I would use that RT capability. Given the considerable performance hit and all three games I want to ray trace, I'm not convinced that paying the extra is worth it. Dat ray traced Control, though.

Option C: RX 580 (for ¬£150 and shipping)

Obviously the least powerful option, the RX 580 still offers a phenomenal value for money at its price point. My plan with this option is to enjoy my library at 1080p until next year, when Big Navi or RTX 3000 series cards arrive. On the upside, I'll still be able to crank settings up and enjoy my library in good enough quality, and even run some games in 4K. 

Thanks for hearing me out, and if there are any other options that you can think of, I'd like to hear them.

TLDR: top rasterised performance, mild ray tracing, or value interim card.",13,1585520801,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/freok8/my_gpu_died_help_me_choose_its_successor/,pcmasterrace,1

frels6,Smithsonian518,Issue with processor in PC build?,"Hello!

My father recently has bought a number of parts for a high powered workstation he can smoothly run CAD on (he followed a build, all the parts are compatible). I made the mistake of not supervising my parents as they started the build, and they ended up calling me over for help when they were ready to do a test boot before they started building it into the case, stating that the bios wouldn't start up. When I arrived, I noticed that the CPU status light at the bottom corner of the motherboard was red, and after referring to the motherboard manual I learned that this light indicates the CPU is not functioning normally. After this I inspect the manner in which they installed the CPU, and find that while the CPU itself is seated normally, the heatsink fan was running on top the CPU only half secured on. After fully securing the heatsink fan properly, the same issue persisted. 

To be more specific about the issue, when shorting the power switch the CPU fan spins up, and the CPU status light remains red. This happens for a few seconds, it turns itself off, then back on repeating the cycle. The processor is an intel i7-9700, and the mother board is a Z390 Aorus Pro.

I'm looking for something with a bit more **oomf**.

What I'm looking for:

1. Multitasking capability. Having several tabs open at one time is necessary for work for me.
2. Entry/mid tier gaming performance. I've been wanting to make the return to World of Warcraft and a few Steam games, but unfortunately, my current rig isn't able to keep up.
3. Screen detail and color correctness would also be a bonus. I am also a photographer so having a mobile editing platform would be incredibly handy. 
4. I am 100% willing to consider previous models from 2018 or 2019. However, I am hesitant in using refurbished or preowned tech. (Internet syphilis never really goes away)
5. I am an Intel and nVidia fanboi but willing to explore the black magic that is Ryzen. 
6. Airflow. I can adjust clocking speeds and such accordingly, but having great airflow is a huge bonus for me  

Unnecessary things:

1. A webcam. Own an external one. 
2. Optical drive. External.
3. A good track pad. I'll be using a mouse 99% of the time. 
4. Audio quality. Gaming headset.

Would love to keep it under $600 but willing to push to $700.

frdqjk,NotTheRocketman,Multiple monitor/ screen setup question.,"Hello!

First off, multiple monitor stuff is new to me, so I hope I don't leave anything out.  Please feel free to ask if I do.

&amp;#x200B;

My desktop setup:

i7-6700 4.0 Ghz, 32GB RAM, 980Ti 6GB (three DisplayPort, and one HDMI)

&amp;#x200B;

I am wanting to essentially create a triple monitor setup, but not in the traditional way, if that makes sense.

What I want to do is use two monitors in a traditional setup on a desk via DisplayPort.  I don't game on this PC non-stop, but this would likely be gaming one one screen, with the other for general use, or gaming on both from time to time.

The third screen would actually be a 4K TV connecting via HDMI.  This would usually be for Netflix, Prime, etc and such, but I would run that through my PC as well.  This would probably be at the same time?  I would probably assume it is, just to be safe.  So, three screens doing different stuff, but only one or two doing the really high intensity stuff (gaming) I think?

* My questions would be, does this sound doable?  I know the 980Ti is the weakest link in the chain, but it's not *that old*, so I'm hoping it should still do the job.
* I've never worked with multiple screens outside of work, so how exactly do you control what is displayed where?  I would imagine Windows will assist with this?  Or some software that is available to help as well?
* Finally, is doing this just a bad idea?  Is it putting excessive stress on something I'm unaware of, that will cause problems somewhere along the line?  I have a great PSU (Corsair 1000W), as I know this will likely cause a bit of a strain.  I tried to over-engineer this system when I built it, in hopes that it was better to be safe than sorry.

I think that's it for now.  Thanks everyone, I appreciate the help!",2,1585517446,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frdqjk/multiple_monitor_screen_setup_question/,pcmasterrace,1

Restarting the client fixes the issue. I haven't been able to diagnose any specific cause for the fps drop.

frddqf,BasicTodd,PC stopped working right as I went into quarantine,"I have a custom built PC that I bought from a friend who had some spare parts and it's been working perfectly fine for the past few months. However, I went to play Overwatch yesterday and it gave me a message saying my ""rendering device has been lost."" I installed a new driver the night before so I tried rolling back the driver and my screen looked...weird. I was able to run the game now but it seemed pixelated and the UI had jagged lines on the edges of the graphics.
Not finding an answer to my issue online I decided to just do a system restore to a couple weeks ago because that's the only one I had available. When the computer booted up it went to an automatic repair screen. There was an option to restart my computer so I tried that. However, when it powered on it turned off after a few seconds. It did this everytime I tried turning it on. My original issue with running Overwatch I assumed was because of the graphics card so I took it out and tried again, which seemed to work at first but now it's in an automatic repair screen loop.
 I've tried multiple times to fix this through solutions I have seen online but nothing has worked. I'm not even able to completely reset the whole system - it pops up with an error message. I put the graphics card back and it's still in the loop so now I'm not sure if that was my original issue. Anyone have any ideas as to what might be my problem? Maybe a bad part? I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to computers so I might be overlooking something.

* Tried running with the fans on high all the time
* Replaced the thermal paste on the card itself (twice)

frc0w3,SquirrelicideScience,"Who are the target audiences for the various high end NVIDIA cards (specifically, 2080 ti, Titan, and Quadro)?","Sorry if this is brought up a bunch, but I've been looking into building a new rig that is not strictly for gaming. Now, I do want to primarily use it as a 4K gaming machine (why can't display makers hurry up and get more 32"" high refresh rate monitors on the market??... but I digress), but I will also be doing a lot of music production, 3D CAD, physical simulation (CFD, FEA, Thermal, etc.), and machine learning and C++ development. 

Now, I know a lot of this is also heavily CPU-centric workloads (hell, music production is often limited more by RAM after a certain tier in CPU performance) but it got me thinking: Do I really need to go all out for a Quadro for these professional grade workloads (I'd really be looking at doing Solidworks), or could I get away with only a Titan, or even just a 2080 ti?

What exactly are the distinct markets each brand is trying to reach? Put another way, what would I have to be working on to necessitate a specific card?

Its a question I've been trying to wrestle with. I know at the least I want to go 2080 ti just for the 4k performance. But should I go even further higher end? What's your thoughts/experiences?

I guess, in general, when should we start seriously thinking about workstation components?

frbgim,juggernog777,First AMD battlestation from 5 countries after gaming for years on a laptop.,"First, I want to say thanks to this amazing community and all of its kind and supportive members. It feels great to join the master race. Last year I started a new job, saved the money, and this sub in special gave me the confidence boost I needed to pull the trigger and buy the parts. I live in Brazil and as my gf from europe was coming to visit me, it was the perfect time to order all those cheaper parts from multiple countries (Germany, France, UK, Greece and Brazil), making this PC a truly diverse beast.

After 4 hours, a few youtube videos and very sweaty hands, everything worked perfectly. From someone who never had touched a pc part before, I can assure someone who is doubt that they can do it too. With patience and research (Hardware Unboxed, Paul's Hardware and Linus Tech Tips helped me a bunch), it is kind of straight forward.

The only fear I had was regarding my RX 5700 XT and multiple drivers problems. I'm glad to say that I haven't had any single issue yet. This MSI RX 5700 XT Gaming X is a true 2x8 pin beast, its pretty and runs cool and at very high frequencies without the need for overclocking. It is very heavy, so I have improved a support for it.

Cheers from Brazil and stay home!

I hadn't played a whole lot since I built it, but with the COVID-19 situation, I've had a lot more time on my hands recently. I've downloaded a couple games this week, SW Battlefront II, Madden 20 (w/ CFBM20 mod), and Forza Horizon 4. In each game, within a few minutes or so, the frame rates drop into the single digits for long periods of time, even in menus. I had assumed that with my RTX 2070, I could run all these games with their ""optimized"" settings (according to GeForce Experience). Now if I reduce the resolution from 4K to 1080p, I get generally better results (still not amazing), but it's so unsatisfying to not be getting the full potential out of your graphics card. I've tried several troubleshooting options already.  I've tried reinstalling the Nvidia drivers. I've tried overclocking w/ Afterburner, which I always have it open on my second monitor to see what's happening. It's not overheating, because I've never seen it go above 65C. It's running at it's advertised MHz. And it does reasonably well on benchmarks (8678 on 3Dmark Time Spy). At this point, I'm starting to consider sending a RMA request to Gigabyte. But I figured that before I go that far, I might try to see if I could get some help from the Internet, so here I am.

My pc had a problem where it would not play minecraft without restarting randomly but i could play all other games fine. This really bothered me as I decided to put a decent amount of money into my build so I could play any game I want for the next while.

My system is: 5700XT Red Devil, Ryzen 3600, B450 Tomahawk MAX, 650W EVGA power supply, 16GB Corsair Vengeance.

I tried everything, MEMTEST86, removing one ram stick at a time, trying different ram slots etc etc with no luck. My temps are fine on GPU and CPU. I could stress test the system with no crash, so I decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 from a usb.

While installing windows 10, I kept getting blue screens during the installation stage and I figured out the only way I could stop the blue screens for long enough to install Windows was to constantly move my mouse around(weird, I know).
Finally got windows installed and boom, before I even install any drivers, BSOD.

I AGAIN re-installed windows but same result. The thing is I can boot into safe mode and no crashes, does anyone have any idea what‚Äôs going on? Faulty MB? CPU? I‚Äôm desperate",12,1585507230,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fraske/pc_keeps_crashing/,pcmasterrace,1

I do need some assistance with a problem I have right now. It's a bit hard to describe, so here's a video: https://streamable.com/ldkdk.

It's hard to hear, but there's a slight rattling noise somewhere in my system, it comes up every few seconds, for a few seconds only. This only happens when playing intense games.

I already tried to figure out where this comes from, and it seems like it isn't the GPU / CPU / case fans.

Trying to hear it out, I feel like the PSU is the problem. Although I'm not quite sure.

I should note that I do not have a HDD in my build, it sounds very similar.

frapu3,exempore,Motherboard PCIe adapter question,"Hi everyone. So I have built my PC few years ago from scratch. I put in the ASUS MAXIMUS HERO VII motherboard and everything was running great. I picked a 4TB Seagate SSHD (6Gb/s SATA I think) for storage purposes but now running a read/write intensive games like Warhammer total war, it is extremely slow. So I thought I could pop a SSD card into the M.2 slot (Samsung SSD 850 EVO SATA M.2 (MZ-N5E250BW)). Turns out that the card is incompatible with my m.2 slot. I would like to fix that issue by getting an adapter and slotting it into one of my unused PCIe slots because I use only 1 for my GPU (PCIE_/x16/X8_1). The other 3 are free. Would you be able to recommend one? Or say if that's not a good solution and why.

My question is : may be that the problem that the PC is restarting because the mobo finds a short circuit caused by my mistake on fixing it too strong ? Thank you very much for the help, i hope someone will see my desperate question. Thank you

frah9s,Aerothermal,Requesting help finding the right gaming PC for VR. [n00b],"Hi, I've wanted a VR headset for years, having been a member at various VR gaming places. I've been putting it off due to cost. Actually, being a member, I could play twice a week for many years and still not reach the cost of a HTC Vive and high-end gaming PC.

Now I've moved, there are no nearby VR places, but I still want that experience. I've opted for a Valve Index (my second choice being a HTC Vive Pro. I know that if I don't invest in the right specification PC then I wont be able to utilise the full performance and refresh rate that an Index offers.

I've never had a gaming PC. My current laptop is an Intel i7 with a Nvidia GeForce MX150 which is great for my everyday needs but I'm sure isn't fine for gaming.

I'm just looking for advice and recommendations for what to shop for. What specification hardware will I need in order to appreciate this headset? I would like it to cost less than ¬£2,000 ($2,500) but that's not a target. I want a good value for money, so at what point does it become diminishing returns? I have looked at [this](https://www.tomshardware.com/uk/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html) ranking to use to compare GPUs, and the Valve website. It seems like it requires Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 / AMD RX480 but recommends Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or better. But if I got near to a GTX 970 will I notice a poor performance?

A lot of top result computers on Amazon have poor reviews, where people have recieved builds with the wrong hardware. Are there any gaming PC companies to trust, or any to avoid?",3,1585506106,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/frah9s/requesting_help_finding_the_right_gaming_pc_for/,pcmasterrace,0

Another friend hops in and asks for invite, he is welcomed, ""sure ill invite you after this game"", they explain how much fun they are having.

fr9rkz,1BMWe92M3,High fps but games have constant microstutter?,"Hello I've built this PC about a year ago and I've had this issue ever since I'm trying to self troubleshoot it but i think I'm stuck. 

Basically Every single game microstutters most of the time when there's a gunfight/explosion. Also it seems to be tied to fps because lower the settings the worse it gets but even max settings/low fps doesn't 100% fix it

Obviously fps drops happen but i remember on my old pc even though games ran at lower settings/fps but they were a lot smoother, sometimes it completely locks up for a third of a seconds making fps games unplayable, so either I,m stuck with very low fps, or i get high fps but crazy stutter.

Specs: 

- AMD Ryzen 2 2700

- EVGA Geforce GTX 1070

- G-Skill Aegis gaming 2x8 GB 3000MhZ

What I tried so far:

- checked if it's isp (it's not)

- Over/underclocking CPU/ram.

- Changed driver settings (performance varies but issue still persists)

- Nothing runs in the background apart from the game I'm playing and it's launcher. And I have window's debloated as well.

- Chipset and ethernet/audio/video drivers are on the latest version.

- Game bar/game mode/background apps are disabled.

- Checked thermals/Cpu usage.

- Power settings on high performance

- Windows can't install Updates automatically.

So I am asking if anyone had similar experiences especially with similar components, people online seem to say 2nd gen ryzen aren't the best for gaming that you should either go for 3600 or intel but it should't be that big of a difference right?

fr9h2u,YaBoyShredderson,Minimizing input lag on gsync compatible monitor,"I have the ASUS Tuf Gaming VG259QM, the recently released 280hz IPS monitor. I want to know how to minimize the input latency, in regards to gsync.

The monitor doesnt have the fully fledged gsync module, its an adaptive sync monitor that nvidia has certified if that makes a difference. 

Playing modern warfare, i get about 170fps, sometimes going up over 200, rarely dipping down to 140. I diabled gsync to see how the tearing was, and at 280hz i didnt notice a single one, so disabling it is fine in that respect. However, i felt a MASSIVE increase to input lag after disabling it. I turned it off in both the monitors OSD and nvidia control panel. 

Whats going on here? I thought competetive players turned it off for the sake of input lag? I saw a battle(non)sense video about that showed, with an nvidia graphics card, disabling g sync actually increases input lag slightly, but it was more than slight, it was borderline unplayable for me. Also, if its supposed to reduce latency, why do pros disable it?

I wanted to replace my CPU (Bannerlord!) from a Ryzen 5 2600 to a Ryzen 5 3600x. My MOBO is an msi x470 gaming plus so I had to update the BIOS before swapping processors. That went fine, everything worked after the update so I turned the computer off and opened her up. Removed the 2600 with no problems, but I bent a couple pins on the 3600x trying to install it. Bent the pins back and slipped it on, but had a ton of trouble screwing the heatsink to the MOBO, a ton of force was needed. Plugged it in and no power. So I opened it back up, readjusted the processor, put the heatsink back on (took less pressure this time) then plugged her in and we had power but a picture wouldn't come onto the monitor. After trying a different monitor and a different HDMI and still no picture I unplugged everything and opened back up. During the CPU installation the GPU got bumped a couple times, so I took it out checked it for any damage and all looked good. Put it back in (little light comes on, so GPU gets power) and plugged it back in, nothing comes on. Don't know what to look at or check, so any suggestions? I've never replaced parts on a computer before so laymans terms would be greatly appreciated, as would advice.

fr8vaj,keyboredYT,Could RGB affects thermals?,"This idea struck me just yesterday in the shower: 

Do you guy all remember the  **HyperX Fury RGB SSD?** Here's the [video from JayzTwoCents](https://youtu.be/vnST5rA64Oc) for who missed it.

Briefly: RGB LEDs, like other light sources, generate loads of heat while being lighted up. This is not a problem if you have an RGB strip or similar. But if you put it all over an SSD (which are extremely sensitive to higher temperatures) you will end up with terrible performance.

So could an RGB cooler pump, RAM, PSU or even a fan affect performance?

My conclusion is : it's difficult. I benchmarked my system with and without RGB on, after a 24h cool down, and the results are pretty much the same, with only 1 degree of difference (which falls in the 2% error of the sensor).

 If you do a little bit of research, you find out that the LEDs efficiency is around 75%, so they dissipate only 25% of what they consume. If you count around 1.6-2.0 watts per foot on a strip with 18 LEDs every foot, that's totally negligible. However modern PC components have up to around 75-100 LEDs in really tight spaces. In my case, my CPU pump has 10 LEDs in less thane 4 inch. Also, having such a thermal mass in such a small space make dissipation harder than on a strip with distanced heat sources. I can't say if my CPU is being affected because my AIO has more than double the CPU's TDP in thermal dissipation, so it's hard to observe a change. In the case of fanse, is pretty much the same thing: 15 LEDS in less that 12 cm, but under constant ventilation. Maybe we could see an ""hairdryer effect"", where hot hair is blown into the system.

Lats but not least, there is a difference between red, green and blue LEDs in term of power consumption because of the different semiconductor used: if you input the same voltage in all of them, you won't receive the same light. Usually, green and red are the most efficient in terms of power consumption. This is explains why on the FuryX you got such high temperature when on rainbow mode  ([bottom of the page](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/storage/fury-rgb-ssd-product-alert) ).

According  [this 2003 document](https://www.hyperxgaming.com/en/storage/fury-rgb-ssd-product-alert) , LEDs can generate up to 80C of heat if not correctly dissipated. That makes sense if you think of the dimensions and efficiency of first generation of LEDs, but now they have been highly improved.

Finally, things could change from system to system: The HyperX Fury SSD suffers from it, but the DELTA MAX SSD from TeamGroup doesn't. Some manufacturer uses old LEDs to save a little bit.

I really want to see some discussion ! Post everything you think could be related, and feel free to correct me or my sources!",2,1585500444,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fr8vaj/could_rgb_affects_thermals/,pcmasterrace,1

So can my high RAM usage be the source of these stuttering (by some how increasing the CPU's performance or via some other means?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it worth it to get another 16 GB DDR 3200 MHz RAMS to have 32 GB total right now or should I wait for DDR5?",11,1585499887,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fr8plz/can_high_ram_usage_cause_stuttering_and_should_i/,pcmasterrace,1

I recently built a desktop using the NZXT H510 case and have a question about the front audio jack.  Is the jack capable of both audio and microphone?  My sons' headsets only have one plug and both headsets have been used successfully on the PS4 and my old Dell desktop via a splitter that has both audio and mic jacks on the front.  I assumed that since there is only one plug in the front that these headsets would work just fine, but I am only able to hear but not speak.  I have the Asus Tuf Gaming Plus mobo with Realtec Audio.

First post here, so I hope this is the right place. I have an Inwin 805 ATX for my gaming rig, with smoked tempered glass on both sides. The way that my gaming room is set up, the PC can only be on the left side of the room, so I'm basically just staring at my cables on my PC. I recently saw \[this post\]([https://www.tomshardware.com/features/mini-itx-rgb-pc-build](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/mini-itx-rgb-pc-build))  from [Tomshardware.com](https://Tomshardware.com) where they build something called the RGBaby. The build uses a Jonsbo A4 Ver 1.1 with similar smoked tempered glass on both sides. I love how you can see the parts of the PC on the right side, so I thought it would be neat to try it with my rig. 

I know I'd have to at least get a new MoBo, but would it even be possible to convert my rig to where I could see the internals from the right side? Thanks for any help.

 \[InWin 805\]([https://www.in-win.com/en/gaming-chassis/805/](https://www.in-win.com/en/gaming-chassis/805/))  This is my current case.

I buy a new motherboard and power supply and my PC still doesn't turn on. I tried the paperclip test and got both of my power supplies to spin for a second. I tried multiple times to get my PC to turn on by using a screwdriver on the pins that turn the PC on, nothing. I have no idea what it could be because everything is plugged in correctly and I have been upgrading my PC for a couple years.

I made the stupid decision of participating in ASUS' and intel's cashback from last year.

They keep stalling, ignoring me and etc. Getting really tired of it. The 125 euros isn't like a dealbreaker, but I would have bought another brand if not thinking this fraud of a cashback was real. 

I'm currently considering taking legal actions, luckily I currently study law lol. 

Just thinking before I spark a process against ASUS, do any other user have a solution of how they managed to get their cashback? Can I go straight and call their headquarters and ignore their promotion team just they ignore me?

I recently upgraded ethernet to Cat7 just to make sure my ethernet is not the issue and still have the same issue.

So I will give the specs on the PC.

I dont really have the time or expertise to build myself but theres a local company that will build to request if I dont go with the pre built option,  my only concern with that pre built. Route is  that they always work out more expensive than if you can get someone to build it.

Main games I was playing was escape from tarkov an some of the total war games,  

So my advise is what parts etc would you recommend for it,    not looking max fps etc   just that it does it reliably,   thinking of a budget of ¬£800 obviously need to save that first but want to get a build in mind to save towards.

The seller assures me he tested them and everything was fine, even sent me screenshots of stress tests he did with it. He has good reviews but who knows.

fr5m1z,Who2Offense,I need SSDs for my build. I need some recommendations.,"I'm currently trying to list down parts for my build. I'm stuck at storage. I'm thinking of using PCIe m.2 SSD 500gb for boot drive, 1tb / 2tb of sata SSD for games and softwares for fast loading and 2tb of HDD for cold storage for movies, photos, etc.

I need that PCIe SSD for data transfer speed. I always need to transfer large files from thumb drive or external drive to home screen folders so I figure PCIe SSD would help with transfer speed. I'm thinking of using Adata XPG SX8200 Pro 500gb.

For cold storage I don't have any problem since they are cheaper and plenty of options.

For sata SSD, it's a bit tricky. The price is almost the same as Intel 660p for 1tb. The lowest would be Patriot P200 2tb but it's DRAM-less. Will it affect loading time for softwares and games? Which budget sata SSD would you guys recommend? I live in Malaysia btw.",10,1585487166,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fr5m1z/i_need_ssds_for_my_build_i_need_some/,pcmasterrace,1

&amp;#x200B;

||TOTAL:|‚Ç¨ 1,074.73‚Ä¨|

Parts picked  either from  [Amazon.de](https://Amazon.de) and [Alternate.de](https://Alternate.de). The biggest argument was whenever to go with Ryzen 5 3600 or even lower like Ryzen 5 1600 AF because from what i saw on benchmarks, 1600AF is still very capable CPU but is it worth it in a  long term ? If he decides to upgrade GPU lets say in 4 years, 1600 AF will definitely gonna be  bottleneck and he will need both new CPU and GPU. His budget for PC alone cant go very much higher than ‚Ç¨ 1000. I'm Intel/Nvidia person so my knowledge may not be as good as someone who is been using for AMD years. Also for driver stability and cooling performance he want to stay with Nvidia GPU.

Currently he has 1080p 60 hz monitor but obviously will be upgrading it, so 1080p 60 hz is not the goal for this build .

**Any advises on AMD CPU or even Nvidia GPU and possibly lowering the price without loosing much in performance ?** Maybe RTX 2060 would be enough which would be ‚Ç¨ 349 and ‚Ç¨ 100 less than Super ? Obviously we both know that he shouldn't expect ray tracing with these cards but he should be able to run modern AAA on High/ Very High graphics and at good Frame Rate.

I'm trying to find a possible fix for my issues, I've tried nearly everything I've seen on forums of PC YouTubers and Microsoft forums. [Here's the PC parts.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ZsdBx6)

**The PC's issues:** Freezes w/o BSoD during watching YouTube or Video games. Freezes w/o BSoD more often during video games. When it freezes the audio distorts slightly. 

**The Attempts I've Made:**  First checked the Error logs, but since their is no BSoD and I have to logs indicating what the issues and the minidump files don't indicate anything either. I've run the check disk and the Windows memory tester. Found no errors. I've tested the PC with 1 ram stick and still the issues ensue.

**Possible Causes:**  I believe that the issues pertain to the graphics card or the motherboard, since I've sort of ruled out it being a power issue since there is a new power supply in it. Other than these two I'm not sure what the solution is.

fr4fct,leethaksor,Looking for a practical wireless headset for working from home,"Hi,

So I'm looking for a new headset for working from home. I already have a few cheap wired headsets and a Nokia bluetooth headset and I'm basically looking for a new headset that fixes the issues I have with the headsets I have. I've been looking at gaming headsets because there seems to be lots of options available. I'm a bit picky on some details so can you recommend headsets that satisfies these points?

1. Wireless, but not bluetooth. I'm having constant trouble with any bluetooth device with my Macbook 15 touchbar. So maybe a proprietary wireless protocol would work better because it doesn't use the broken Macbook bluetooth. 
2. Support for 3.5 mm headphone jack. 
3. No LEDs to drain the battery. If there are LEDs I must be able to turn them off once and for all. No requirement to turn the headset on in a particular way to avoid the LEDs. I want a setting to get rid of them.
4. No propietary charging cable or a cumbersome dock. I already have plenty of micro-usb cables on my desk so I want to use them. No more stuff on my desk.
5. Preferably has an on/off button that you can simply flick on or off. Not a time-delay switch that you need to wait for like an idiot. Not a deal breaker, but I just don't like the delay switches.
6. Good quality microphone. 
7. Price below 150 dollars or euros.

fr4af5,littlenymphy,New PC trying to figure out fans and temperatures,"So I have a new PC and I've just been playing about with the fans to try and get a good balance between low temps and low noise. 

It's the first time I've had any AIO cooling so I keep worrying it's not working but the BIOS says it's running fine. The fans are all set to standard currently in the BIOS, I did try them all on silent for a bit but it didn't reduce the noise that much and the temps increased. I also tried the QFan Optimize All option but the noise level just kept going too high and the temp readings were very unstable. My problem is that depending on where I'm looking at the temperature I'm getting different values.

I have CoreTemp which is showing that my CPU is idling at about 39/40C and when playing Guild Wars 2 it can hit 70C maximum. This seemed quite high considering I have a ""gaming"" laptop that hits about 70C when playing Guild Wars 2 (although not on max settings) so I ended up downloading AMD Ryzen Master and that seems to show it idling at 33/34C and when gaming it was hanging about 50-55C max which is quite a difference.

When looking at my fans in the BIOS I had a look at the temp there and that was sitting at 41C so seems to agree more with CoreTemp but why would I be getting different temperatures from the AMD program?

If CoreTemp and the BIOS are the correct readings, do these seem high? If so, I'll have another look into the fan settings some more but if not I might just leave things as they are since my noise level isn't too bad right now.",5,1585480134,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fr4af5/new_pc_trying_to_figure_out_fans_and_temperatures/,pcmasterrace,1

Wondering if anyone has an answer to this one? 

In my research, I have found that the PS3/Xbox 360 were - in terms of GPU horsepower - around the equivalent of an Nvidia 7800 GT (Xbox) and the 7800 GTX (PS3).  

Does this sound about right? According to my understanding, the 7800GT(X) GPUs were the first in the 7800 series before Nvidia refreshed the GPUs once for the 7900 series? 

This would put the graphics capability of the 7th gen consoles at the top of the stack for the time they were released?

fr3hoa,WagonWheelie,Finding a good pc building website UK,"I have fallen out of touch with recent happenings in the gaming world. I have a playstation which I recently turned on for the first time in 2 years and without wanting to commit too much I downloaded 2 free games to test - fortnite and call of duty warfare. I'm having loads of fun especially with all this free time in isolation.

I have connected with some friends who tell me that Ps4 is way behind in terms of performance and they have all moved to PC. Let's face it ps4 is years old and can't compete with PC in the first place. I'm aware I get 60 fps max on ps4 and I can see the obvious disadvantage. I'm hooked and already committed to buying or building a PC.

I have built PCs in the past (10 years ago or more) and I'm sure not much has changed, if anything it should be easier. I'm out of the loop when somone tells me Intel is no longer leading the chipset race. With that said and graphic cards come in all sorts these days I'm a bit out of touch with what is needed to run a smooth session. Obviously faster part equals better but I do have a budget.

Can anyone recommend a UK site I can spend ¬£550 or less and get a PC that runs fortnite and warfare on 150+ fps.

I'm confident I can put one together if I have to so it doesn't have to be a package, I can build it myself if I need to order individual parts. Refurbished or used is also acceptable.

I see an offer for windows 10 for ¬£39 too but any sites Ive seen add this for ¬£70-90 just for installation which I can do myself.

If anyone is feeling helpful and has the time to recommend I would be greatful in moving to PC gaming. I'm very competitive and hate the major disadvantage of playing on console right now.

I can source monitor keyboard and mouse easily enough.

Everything was working fine for about a week.

The problem is now that I am not getting any display from my asus gaming GTX 1080, fans start up for about 2 seconds then white lights flash 2 to 4 times on top of the board then nothing. No display, no more lights. 

The two small lights on top of the power connectors are lit up white, I have tried different PCI slots, drawing power from 2 power cables and another computer and the problem is the same. 

Last night I simply removed it, put another GPU to test it and put it back in. I was careful to ground myself and the pc was completely unplugged when doing all the manipulations.

Also tried resitting the RAM, removing BIOS battery, and another GPU in the same build which works fine.

Is my GPU dead? Only bought it second hand a week ago and it doesn't seem like I did anything wrong?

fr32yk,DenDrittungen,Overheating CPU and a defect GPU... I think,"Hi all,  


I've recently been having som trouble with my computer and I can't really say what it is. Previously, it would have had no problems running the latest AAA games at high settings 1080p and reaching somewhere around 90fps, however now, it wont even do 30fps at low settings. I've tried everything I could think of, cleaning the insides of the PC, applying new cooling paste, switching Sata cables for my drives, but nothing has worked as of yet.

I built this computer almost 4 years ago now, and there haven't really been any problems of which i haven't been able to solve myself, until now.

&amp;#x200B;

To more easily try to convey what i've been doing, heres a list of events:

&amp;#x200B;

Tuesday: Everything is running smoothly, no problems whatsoever. 90fps in COD MW and around 70fps in NFS Heat

Wednesday: COD MW is struggling to hit 30fps and NFS Heat is an unplayable mess. I tried updating gpu driver, but it didn't help. MSI Afterburner shows CPU to be overheating (100\*C idle)

Thursday: Blew away dust and cleaned everything inside the computer. CPU is still 100\*C idle

Friday: Applied new cooling paste, CPU now runs at 25-30\*C idle, noticeable improvement in NFS Heat, however it's still chugging. Doom is also stuttering and struggling to hit 30.

Saturday (this is were the fun begins): Realized that all the games i've have had troubles with are on the HDD, so I tried games like RDR 2 and CS:GO which are installed on the SSD. CS runs as it should at around 250 fps. RDR 2 at around 60, and no noticeable stuttering (Although i haven't com further than the prologue). All good, the HDD is the problem right?  


No, i tried moving Doom from the HDD to the SSD, and the game was still chugging. I tried switching out the SATA-cables, however that didn't change anything. After reinstalling windows and downloading Doom again, there still was no improvement. Alright then, onto benchmarks

Cinebench: (forgot to take a screenshot of the results)  CPU is performing well and not overheating

UserBenchmark:[https://imgur.com/a0WFnlQ](https://imgur.com/a0WFnlQ) GPU seems to be underperforming

Unigine Superpostion: [https://imgur.com/a/WS3vdWD](https://imgur.com/a/WS3vdWD) 

3DMark Time Spy: [https://imgur.com/a/HBTzTDN](https://imgur.com/a/HBTzTDN) CPU seems to be underperforming

I checked Afterburner one last time, and the CPU is once more at 100\*C idle

&amp;#x200B;

Sunday (today): I'm writing this post in hopes that some of you may be able to help me as i can't really think of any solutions other than replacing almost the entire machine.

Thank you

fr2nk1,fd0263,Should I be worried about system crashes after long periods of load?,"Since the uni I go to has had a teaching break, I‚Äôve been catching up on lectures while grinding double xp on Vermintide 2 in the background for decent periods of time. My gpu never gets hotter than normal (never over 75c), but twice in the past two days I‚Äôve had to turn my computer off because of the system having an issue. The first time, all the monitors went into sleep mode and my headphones stopped playing music as if the computer had switched off but the fans were still running and the power light was on. The second time I was looking at a pdf of lecture slides which seems to be surprisingly heavy on most systems while grinding and then everything froze and did that weird purply graphical glitching on every window I had open. Pressed the power off button and it asked me if I wanted to shut down but once I clicked yes I got the blue screen of death anyway. 

These were both after 4-5 hours of continuous use. I have somewhat recent drivers and I am updating to new ones but I‚Äôm also wondering if this is a warning sign for the imminent death of my gpu or hdd (the game and the lectures are stored on the same disk, but the OS is on my ssd). I run Vermintide 2 on high settings if that matters, which usually gets about 50-60fps. I have also occasionally seen graphical glitches in the form of a small horizontal section of the screen that displays the wrong part of my fov for a split second (kinda looks like screen tearing but clearly isn‚Äôt). 

Rapid fire info in case it‚Äôs useful: I have overclocked a little in the past but usually run at base clock, all of my hardware was bought new, I use my PC for a mix of gaming and work, it gets a lot of use with a lot of time spent with lots of chrome tabs open, gaming use has been up and down since I got it but it‚Äôs been somewhat heavy use (like 10 hours a week avg), both of the times that it crashed I was not actually watching a lecture in that moment but I was playing Vermintide 2, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had two crashes in two days with my setup, I have had them occasionally, it gets to take a break every now and then when I go to eat or do something else, I have played around 40hrs this week, the lectures are 720p or 1080p 30fps and I play them at double speed which occasionally causes the lecture to skip when I‚Äôm also loading the game, the first time after each crash it takes considerably longer to start up. 

My specs

2 silent in fans and 1 loud out fan

Cpu: i5 7500 (got mid 2017, right before zen released üò¢)

Gpu: R9 380 (got in early 2016)

fr2g7s,Kathy2715,Swapping (not Hot Swap Obv) GPU from 16_2 to 16_1 is causing a BSOD crash.,"The BSOD is TDR VIDEO FAILURE. 
Originally when I built the pc I chose the second slot as when trying to fit in the first I thought it didn‚Äôt fit, now finding out the bracket was slightly bent and didn‚Äôt allow the GPU to completely click into place, but worked on the second slot. 

Anyways, I was swapping the GPU (RX 5700 xt) to the top slot, but as soon as that happened, Windows would crash maybe 30ish seconds after logging in. 

I went into safe mode to install video drivers, maybe they were corrupt? Needed to reinstall? either way, clean install. 

Coming out of safe mode, I noticed the drivers weren‚Äôt installed, showed windows basic display driver, so I installed again, out of safe mode. Restart, crashing continues again. 

In Task Manager, I noticed right before crashing, the GPU would spike, 15, 24, 40 or so, then spike to a near max Utilization, then BSOD. Every single time, I opened task manager, and yes, would spike near to max or max then crash. 

Temps are good. I tried with No OC, all same issues. 

I swapped the GPU back to slot 2, everything is working perfectly fine again. 

Any ideas how to fix this? Does keeping it in slot 2 worsen performance ? BiOS recommends slot 1. Would also like slot 1 so the GPU isn‚Äôt so close to the case. MoBo is ASUS ROG STRIX b450 f gaming.

I'm sorry if this has been asked before but I've been looking all over the place to find a proper answer. Basically I bought some components from a friend at work as he gave up with his build - the main thing I'm interested in is the B350-F mobo and looking to put a Ryzen 3rd gen CPU in it. But I understand that I would need to get an older CPU first (I don't have an AMD cpu to hand atm) in order to be able to update the bios for 3rd gen support. As far as I'm aware the board itself doesn't have an Bios flash so I'm stuck with buying a suitable CPU just to upgrade. What CPU's will work and are cost effective? seeing as I'm literally going to be plugging it in once to update. Also I'm assuming it needs to be AM4 socket as that's what the board is?

Games will be buttery smooth most of the time, but then what feels like randomly, once or twice a minute, a drop in frames comes (seems like it often coincides with a lot of action on screen, but that could just be when I'm noticing it / getting bothered by it the most).

*Processing img qxs74p49ljp41...*

Finally moved my system into the Dan A4 SFX V4.1!!

Specs:

CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K @ 5 GHz (direct die cooled with liquid metal)

Mobo: Asus Rog Strix Z390-I Gaming

Cooler: Asetek 645LT 92mm AIO

GPU: PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Blower

Drives: 970 EVO Plus 1TB (macOS boot drive), 660p 1TB (Windows), 860 QVO 2TB (data/game drive)

Case: Dan A4 SFX V4.1 (OverclockersUK had a great bundle)

PSU: Corsair SF750

Monitor: LG 32GK850G-B

Fans: 2 x Noctua NF-A9x14

&amp;#x200B;

[Cable management is not my strong suit](https://preview.redd.it/kz43wm6jnjp41.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b46630d77f46a62b2e274a2bfbfbdb1ef62b6c9f)

I lost very little performance when I moved to this case from the Lian Li PC 011 Dynamic. I originally had a 5.1 Ghz overclock but I was able to get to 5 Ghz by delidding and going direct die with liquid metal. Temps top out at 93 degrees Celsius after sustained loads and gaming is nothing short of amazing with a 2080 Ti driving my 32 inch, 1440p, 144hz, G-Sync monitor. I get smooth 120 FPS on max settings in Modern Warfare which is my primary game as of now.

&amp;#x200B;

[If I didn't go blower style.....](https://preview.redd.it/2jc1f4aepjp41.jpg?width=1536&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=381cbef0f0153c5baf618a9c2018830de38a0247)

I really don't know what temps I'd get if I went with an open air card. I'm sure my GPU would be fine (if not a bit better) but I'm sure my CPU would constantly be thermal throttling even with a more modest overclock.

I have 2 AOC 32‚Äô‚Äô curved monitors, one 1080p, one 1440p. 1080p was my only one for a few months then i upgraded. Once i upgraded to dual monitors i noticed my pc seems to run at a lower fps on the same settings. I use the 1440p as my main monitor, and i do know that fps will drop with higher pixel screens. But before, i could achieve ultra settings on most AAA games (MW, Battlefield, etc) without dipping below 80. To get 60+ now i play on medium to high settings. Is it the size of the monitors causing this? The pixel density? Could it be the dynamic background from wallpaper engine playing on the monitor not in use while gaming?",4,1585454369,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqzf0t/bottleneck_or_gpu_just_doing_a_lot_of_work/,pcmasterrace,1

fqyrzj,ReddingtonTR,Looking to upgrade my computer and need help.,"Hey, there! I have a computer that I consider fairly decent, but I'm constantly facing issues with it running at sub-60 FPS, even on low, for certain games. It's running on some older hardware, but before I decide on what to drop money on, I would like you guy's opinions on what is holding my computer back or what I should upgrade?

I ask this question before, and people seem to believe that my GPU is the biggest factor holding my computer back.

I'm just looking to run at 60 FPS on High/Ultra at 1080p on modern games, such as Borderlands 3. Idealy, I'm also looking to be able to play games on one monitor and watch videos/movies on the other without a sub-60 FPS drop for modern games.

Thanks!

fqyrhb,RadicalSnowdude,Would a PSU cause a system to freeze,"In my computer my case and cpu fans spin and the lights light up when the power supply is switched on without pushing the power button. And it stays on when windows is shut down. The only way to shut them down is by switching off the power supply switch. 

My computer would also freeze entirely (entire system, not just windows)and the bios would reset upon restart and reset ram and overclocking and stuff. 

I replaced the board with an Asus X470F just now and I switched on the PSU 5 minutes ago. But i still have the issue with the lights and fan spinning. I don‚Äôt really want to test further to see if the bios resets and the computer freezes because I don‚Äôt want to do something that stops me from being able to return the board to Amazon.

Would a PSU cause this problem? I did some research and I found out the problem with the lights could be either the mobo or psu. I replaced the mobo and that didn‚Äôt solve it so that leaves the PSU. But how would the PSU being defective explain the system freeze and bios reset?

I bought a budget pre-prebuild pc about a year ago.

This one in fact:  [https://www.amazon.com/CYBERPOWERPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A8/dp/B07VGJDKZ4?ref\_=ast\_sto\_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/CYBERPOWERPC-Xtreme-i5-9400F-GeForce-GXiVR8060A8/dp/B07VGJDKZ4?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1) 

and I am starting to get into some games that my PC really is just having a hard time running. Call of Duty: War Zone for example.

&amp;#x200B;

I am thinking that if I just get another stick of 8gbs of ram, buy a i5-9600kf, and a GTX2060 that I should be able to play most games on higher settings for the next couple years.

any advice anyone can give me would be great. If you guys think I should just start over and build my own PC that is an option for me, if I did that my budget would be like $1200ish but I'm thinking that might be unnecessary and I can just upgrade what I have.

fqy7zc,ChipsAhoiMcCoy,"Brothers, my colors are fucked.","I'm not really sure what's going on here, but I haven't really noticed it before playing my Switch recently. Basically, the switch has this range setting you can set to limited or full, which will limit the RGB range to either 0-255 for full, or whatever numbers the limited one is. So, when setting the range to ""full"" on my switch, the games look fantastic, and the colors really pop and the contrast is great. However, once I tab back into my PC, the colors and contrast just don't look nearly as good, and I'mnot sure why. Everything on my PC has this ""greyish"" or, ""limited RGB"" look to it. I've checked my nvidia settings to see if my range was set to full, and it seems to be set to full. Unless i'm in the wrong area? Not sure though. But the only real difference between these two inputs would be that the switch is running via HDMI, and the monitor is running via DVI=D I believe. Obviously the PC uses a different graphics card, but yeah. I have a GTX 1080, and an XB271HU monitor. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

As a side note, I would say my PC colors are washed out and ""greyish"" and i'd say my switch colors are very vibrant and poppy. They aren't TOO vibrant though.

ive tried creating a windows boot drive, as i lost my other one and i kept running into all sorts of problems i simply couldnt use the windows creation tool as it kept getting stuck at a certain percentage, which was 29% on the 'creating' screen so i decided to take a different route and try to do it the rufus route which again also got stuck at a certain percentage, also no luck there however it did keep getting stuck on copying a file called 'boot.wim'.

so with my efforts of trying that i have decided to try and resort to the reset setting in the windows settings which was going fine and well until it has hit me with a 'there was a problem restting your pc' which then caused my pc to undo the resetting changes leaving me back at square one.

i have ran all sorts of system checks, anti virus checks etc. it started fairly recently when i started to let my brother use my pc during the whole quarantine break, but he said that he hasnt downloaded anything, i havent downloaded anything. ive checked the last downloads have been around 2.5 weeks ago and my pc has been acting weird for the last few days ago.

so i have a friend who can make me a usb bootable drive from his pc, but the question is the bootable drive even work? or is also going to give me errors like it has been the last day of me trying to do things?

iam genuinely lost at this point as im not too good at pcs

* CPU stress using PRIME95 - No problem
* GPU stress using Furmark - PC restarts

I would also like to do this on other games where they don't have a resolution scaler, I have 1080ti and if it's 1080p and the game isn't graphically demanding it only gets used like 70% or less and that takes my fps down but if I can somehow push my render resolution and make the got run at 90% I get more fps

fqwoz2,EternallyErect,Fans live by their own rules,"Hi, I just built a PC in the Phanteks P600S case.

In the beginning I was wondering why the fan speed on my NZXT kraken cooler would be at 100% all the time, but after a bit of troubleshooting I found that it was the fan hub's fault. 

I plugged the fan hub into the CPU fan header and I enjoyed a moment of silence before the ramps kicked in, and went silent, kicked in and went silent. It goes between high RPM to low RPM (and thus noise levels go from loud to unnoticeable) all the time.
One thing to note is that I can't see the fan RPM in NZXT Cam anymore. And looking at how much the CPU temperature swings its no wonder they can't be stable. 

How do I fix these rampant fans?

fqwc7i,seabutcher,Getting with the times- how's this renovation?,"I've got a PC that's been Ship of Theseus-ing its way through the years since 2007.

At this point the only single part that hasn't been replaced at least once is the case (which, having moved house with me three times and been owned by my teenage self, is looking the worse for wear).

At the same time the single newest piece of kit in there is a secondhand 750Ti.And while I'd like to upgrade that... I think the real bottleneck here is that I'm still using a Socket 775 motherboard. Yes, the Intel Core 2 series. My long-serving Q6600 was fairly recently swapped out for a Q9550 when I found out how cheap those are since nobody actually \*wants\* anything from that decade any more.

She's doing well, I've played Doom (2016) on this duct-taped fossil of a machine (1440x900 resolution) but in terms of actual upgrades, I think there's only so far replacing the GPU can get me before I have to just accept that I won't get any more of a meaningful performance boost without gutting everything else.

My CPU could do with an upgrade. But if I want a newer CPU, I need a newer CPU \*socket\* I can't get that without replacing my motherboard. If I replace my motherboard... I'm going to need some RAM for it, because I doubt I can find an AM4 board that supports DDR3.

I just got a bonus from work, and seeing as folding@home is pretty important these days I'm trying to convince myself this is also a way to do my part for the good of humanity. So.... maybe it's time to take the hit.

I can still salvage my PSU, my SSD (also acquired somewhere along this weird and wonderful journey) and my hard drives, plus my GPU is... not exactly top-notch, but it'll fill the gap while my wallet recovers from this. My case needs to go, she's served me well but the faceplate is falling off and we don't have those modern blue USB ports. Plus, if I've got to replace a motherboard anyway, that seems like the best chance I'll get to just stick it all in a new case.

So here's my [current wishlist](https://www.ebuyer.com/lists/9BFD1252A6CF43605559D05B0F49A712), I would appreciate feedback and advice on what I'm looking at buying. If possible, recommendations to make it cheaper too (I'm already over budget here).

fqvyeg,Krythic,Why don't some laptops come without a battery?,"This is an honest question, and observation. Why don't some laptops ship without a battery, and instead have more options for storage space and better heat management, etc? I honestly can't remember a single time that I've used my laptop and not had it plugged in. So why not identify this as a manufacturer, and research how the space could be better utilized? A laptop would basically be a mobile desktop, which is how most people use them anyway. Now, I'm not saying we should completely replace all laptops like such, because portability is useful to some people, and I won't deny that. But for most people, the battery is just wasted potential/space, especially in gaming computers, where batteries last maybe an hour or two tops anyway, and cause throttling problems.

I get that some people won't agree with anything I've just said, I just wanted to have a conversation about it. Why hasn't this been done?",8,1585440950,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqvyeg/why_dont_some_laptops_come_without_a_battery/,pcmasterrace,0

fqvrh7,polinko90,4k 60hz medium VS 1440p high settings,"Hello everyone! I'm currently having a dilemma on how to play the Square Enix Tomb Raider reboot trilogy.

I was aiming for max settings on my 24"" 144hz monitor but then I had the idea of plugging my GPU to my 43"" 4K TV and here's what I got on ROTTR:

\-- High textures with AF set to trilinear and shadows set to medium: stable 60 fps at 4K resolution

or better settings for 1440p at 60 fps.

Which one would be preferable? I really can't decide.  I keep reading that the trilinear setting is awful and to always bump AF to x8 or x16 but the FPS go down to 40 using the game's benchmark test.

Maybe I should go with 1440p? or some higher options it has that are not 4K. Although I really wanted it to run at the TV's native resolution.

My GPU is a 5700XT and I'd be playing with a controller a meter away from the screen.

I bought it on Best Buy as part of a Black Friday deal for $1399. I absolutely love this laptop, it's does everything I want it to do (video watching, school, work, gaming) all in one small nice looking package. Every game I've tried works very well.

Up to this point, I tend to lock most games to 60, besides Rainbow Six Siege (I let this run unlocked reaching 150-180 FPS), since I find that anything higher in a non competitive game is not necessary. However, oftentimes I obsess about the frame rate, if the frame-time is good, messing around with the graphics options, and what not. Even locking to 30FPS for games like RDR2 which I like to max out as high as possible without going under 30fps. 

Basically, right now, I'm considering going ""fuck it"" and run all my games unlocked, graphics as high as possible without going under 30, remove the frame counter, and just game. I did it with Dirt Rally 2, and it felt good just gaming and I don't know if its because of the response time, but when it dips below 60, its not as distracting. 

To those of you who game unlocked on your laptop, whats your experience? Is a laptop like mines safe to run buckwild and not suffer overheating?

\-----

Hey y'all, I find myself in a bit of a situation, and it takes a lot of explaining so bare with me.

I am a freelance visual effects artist and video editor, massively into games and am trying to get a stream off the ground, am beginning development on a game in UE4 and just in general work on my computer pretty every day. I am currently running a 4770k + 3GB 1060 + 16 GB RAM setup that in desperate need of an upgrade...and here's where it gets fun. I've been saving for a new system for coming up on a year now, and have had a couple instances of life getting in the way to being able to pull the trigger financially.

Right now, I find myself in a better situation financially to go for something new, but now it's gotten into the year enough that new parts will be out relatively soon, so I am weighing options for new parts:

1. Recycle what I can from my current setup -&gt; 3600x (currently on sale) + 2070 to save some money - I'd get a great gaming system, and tide me over until the fall when everything from the new-gen is out. I'd be a cheaper overall investment with the plan to spend more within the year.
2. Recycle what I can from my current setup -&gt; 3700x + 2060/1660ti - plan to get on the 3000s Nvidia cards when they drop. Being so close to Ryzen 4th gen, it's hard to justify getting into the cycle right now, but it is an option.
3. Brand new system -&gt; 3700x/3800x + 2070 super (the system I have been looking at purchasing for the last 6 months) and invest in for several years to come.

Ultimately this is going to come down to how much I want to spend and when, but I am curious if any of you smart homies out here can lend some insight.

fqvam0,Couto710,Weird game stutters,"When I'm playing certain online games, sometimes I get some stutters, even though my FPS don't suffer a lot of changes. This is happening on COD Warzone, but it also happened when I played PUBG. It usually happens when there's enemies in my FOV, even if not visible, there could be 1 or 2 houses (or something else) between us, and the game would start to stutter. But I get these stutters while maintaining 60+ FPS (60-80, sometimes more). Has anyone experienced this? What could be causing this? I repasted both the GPU and the CPU on my laptop, and cleaned it up a little bit, and formatted the disk last week, and even though it improved a little bit, sometimes it still happens. I don't think it's a performance issue, because like I said i can maintain 60-80 FPS, sometimes it climbs to near 100 (which is where I limited the game, because I thought it could help).

does anybody know where i could find a suitable replacement that has an 18-key panel like the G15 or Vengeance keyboards?",0,1585437406,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fquyrb/picky_keyboard_users_help/,pcmasterrace,2

My C drive and my laptop in total has only 225 GB of storage, and I already have a few games Installed on C drive. If I partition and create a D drive, what happens to those games?

Also, does having games on another drive than C help with performance?

I just finished installing a kraken g12+corsair h100i on my gtx 770, and after struggling several times to boot into windows and some cold sweat I eventually managed to long enough to check the gpu temp, which was 93¬∞ at idle. I'm thinking 2 things, either the aio pump is dead (got the aio used) or the ridiculously rigid tubing is pulling on the mount so hard because of that almost 180¬∞ bend it needs to make to reach the gpu that it's pulling the block off the die. Leaning towards the latter as I can hear the pump, it is clicking but I read that's a common issue with h100i's and air pockets. Goes away after a bit.

So I wanted to ask, has anyone else tried to use a g12/g10 bracket with a corsair aio with those extra stiff tubes? Any similar issues, any advice? Thanks!

I've tried everything from changing ram frequency to driver updates, I'm running out of ideas before I go back to my previous build.

* **CPU:**  AMD Ryzen 7 2700
* **Mobo:**  Gigabyte B450M-D3SH
* **Ram:**  Curcial Ballstix sports 2x8 16GB 3000MHz
* **GPU:**  GigaByte 1060 6GB
* **PSU:**   Corsair CX550M

My Ram is currently running on 3200MHz.

Any ideas and help would be greatly appreciated!

When that straight white line moves or turns yellow I start lagging. I notice this happens depending on actions I do in the game, let's say if I I emote that line immediately turns yellow and I cant move and get massive lag.

If it was the internet then I assume I would lag no matter what I do, but it happens more when I do specific actions such emoting. 

What makes me think is not the game but my internet is that I'm watching other people streaming the game perfectly with no issues. I even asked them and said no lag.

fqt05p,AlpacaLps,Ryzen 9 3950X Idle/Load Temps,"Silly Questions...

I have been using Folding@Home and it's the only essentially ""stress test"" my computer has had since my build last month.  I unfortunately haven't had time for gaming or editing.  Most of the time we're just using it for YouTube or Twitch as we're falling asleep after work.  The idle temperature with a modest fan setting in my tiny HTPC case was around 55¬∞C with the Corsair H80iV2 (extra thick 120mm radiator with two Noctua 15x120mm fans in push/pull going out the case).  On the opposite side of the case, I have two Noctua 25x120mm iPPC industrial fans bringing fresh air in.

Since I started F@H, the idle temperature has been sitting around 65¬∞C, and the highest peak of the week at 107¬∞C.  Most of the time the peak is only 90¬∞C, but that still seems high, even though that is when the 3950X is at full 100% load on all cores.  I guess the question is, should I be concerned with these high temps?  I know I am already pushing more heat through the AIO than I should, but I was limited to only a single 120mm radiator by the case, so I got the thickest AIO radiator I could fit.  I had to do the dual 15x120mm fans for it to fit as normal 25mm were too thick.  If I turn up the pump speed on the AIO, is this going to help any or am I going to have it just fail sooner?

Also, in case anyone is wondering, I used IC Diamond as the thermal paste (recommended by a Microcenter employee as it was years since my last build when I used Arctic Silver).

fqsdfx,Ch3vr0n,"Swapping to 144hz, do i need new cables?","Recently (not accounting for the corona situation) i've begun gaming a little more again than i used to. My primary monitor i do this on is an Asus VG278HR (no idea if it supports gsync) connected to an [Asus ROG Strix GTX 1080A](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/ROG-STRIX-GTX1080-A8G-GAMING/specifications/). Monitor 2 is an Asus VK278Q (gsync compatible)  which is mainly used for keeping a browser open during gaming (in case i need to look stuff up real quick). It is NEVER used as the gaming monitor.

Both monitors are connected to a dual monitor stand with the VG278HR on the left and the VG278Q on the right

Now from the specifications, this monitor is 144hz capable at HDMI 1.4. I've just never been able to make it work somehow. Maybe i'm using the wrong cables. If you'll look at the GPU gallery (vertical image showing the video ports), the cable for the primary monitor is connected to the HDMI port closest to the Display port ones (2nd from the top).

I'm perfectly fine with 1080p gaming, i'd just like to kick the fluidity up a notch. My nvidia control panel only lists refresh rates up to 60hz and is currently set to ""1080p,1920x1080 (native)"" under the section ""UltraHD, HD, SD""

I checked my cables for text and the one on the primary monitor is a ""Profigold SC 11883"", the secondary one has ""CTI AWM 20276 vw1"" on it and is approx 1.8m long. I'm rather savvy in hardware but when it comes to cables for 144hz it looks like i may need a little education into the whole 144hz thing. Is it worth going for gsync?

I have a few requirements

* I'd rather swap BOTH cables out at once
* If recommended, i am more than willing to swap them from HDMI to Displayport
* 3D video capabilities MUST BE PRESERVED
* if needed, i guess i could swap the screens position but i'd rather not

Any of you hardcore gamers (i used to be one of you lol, competitively in lans/clans) cable savvy persons can eduate me what i'm doing wrong to fix this. I don't want to upscale resolution as i don't have the funds to replace both monitors.

Right now i know this

* both monitors are 144hz capable
* both monitors are NOT outputting at 144hz
* more hz = more fluid gameplay (considering i'm into shooters &amp; racers, that's a must have)

Thanks for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* edit \*\* did some digging on the monitor's connectivity

Primary monitor: VGA, DVI (Dual Link), HDMI

Secondary monitor: DVI (Dual link), HDMI, Displayport

so it looks like HDMI might be the problem here.

fqr1sk,IlIIIlIlllI,I'm rubbish with computers but I would like a gaming PC!,"Ever since 2000 I've used 99% Linux as I never really do anything with computers except word processing, web browsing and emails. My computers are very old and never really gets upgraded except when the computer literally dies and I just buy a refurbished computer! I say this just to ""set the scene"".

Recently I've started playing flight simulators with friends, and this lead to me installing Windows and Steam on my computer. I've found that it will crash constantly when trying to run counter strike and flight simulators and the performance is unsurprisingly poor. Regardless, I'm finding them fun and I've been told ""Buy a gaming PC, it'll be worth it"" which feels reasonable enough. 

I literally have no idea what I'm looking at with specs. I looked on one website which suggests I need to spend ¬£1,400 on a PC which will run XPlane 11. If this is the case, then I may as well end my journey here as I can't afford ¬£1,400 every few years.

My questions: I'd like to buy MS Flight Simulator 2020 when it comes out, what spec computer would likely be good enough to run it at a reasonable level when it is published.

Where is recommended and good to buy a computer within the UK?

I've had a look at the Wiki and it talks a lot about ""builds"" of computers. I really don't want to build a PC. I just want to plug it in and go. I have very little time and I feel the learning curve is steep enough right now.

fqqk4h,Umbrasia,Hey there a quick question about gaming laptops!,"Hey all!

I'm about to go off to college soon and have about 1500-1800 to spend on a laptop. I'm looking for something that can run games like Overwatch and Monster Hunter on Medium at least will stellar FPS still. I am looking for a laptop since it will be more portable and just overall easier for me in college. I have a nice set up at home but I'm going to leave it at home until I at least get out of the dorms and in a new place (which will be a while). I have a XPS 15 but it's just slacking and I really do need something better. 

I was looking at the Lenovo Legion Y740 or a Dell G7 15. Are there any hidden gems I might not know about? I know laptops aren't preferred over desktops for gaming but I just need something that will get me through a year or two until I can get my own place in college.

fqq6yq,craig_hoxton,My 2nd Rebuild,"Just before the world shut down, I rebuilt my gaming PC for the second time. My first build was from 2011 and this was rebuilt in 2015 (see below). 

Decided to ditch the NZXT case for something smaller and get a more modern, but not top-of-the-range GPU. Work in IT (sadly) so I'm doing hardware stuff all day every day, so can only game/do my own hardware work on the weekend.

[Pics](https://imgur.com/a/l8LBG9m)

After watching online reviews (Hardware Canucks/BitWit) I really liked the Be Quiet! Pure Base 500 case (got the all-white non-window version) and reviews for the GTX 1660 Super (prior GPU was GTX 970) appealed to me.

Very happy with my new set-up and the Be Quiet! case was a pleasure to work on!

EVGA 750 watt PSU
Be Quiet 500 case

Only play older games such as Fallout 4, Skyrim, Kenshi (a non-AAA Skyrim on Hard Mode), Mad Max, XCom 2, Elite: Dangerous as my hands aren't what they used to be so I can't play twitch shooters any more.

fqq1iq,Precone,Looking for some help with upgrading my build!," Hello all!

I built my first PC in the summer of 2016 and am looking to make some improvements in key places to improve my build. I primarily am using my computer for gaming and am looking to consistently have a framerate of 144hz, which my DELL monitor allows. Despite having such a nice monitor, I feel that the 2560x1440 resolution means that I am not always able to achieve my desired 144 frames with my current build and am looking to be able to do this across all game types (MOBA, FPS, etc.) I'm thinking that my processor/motherboard/graphics card all could be points to start with. With my current setup, what could I change to get the largest improvement in performance, and what product in specific would you change to?

Basically: You're playing a game in fullscreen for the first time and everything is fine, then you decide to ALT+TAB to check something out, you come back to the game and find out the game's only using half of your monitor's refresh rate, for example: you own a 144hz monitor and the game's now using something like 50hz or 60hz. It is **not** your monitor doing this, it's Windows! Here's how to fix it:

**Find your game's executable file, right click on it -&gt; properties -&gt; compatibility -&gt; then check ''Disable fullscreen optimizations'' just make sure you click apply after that and you're done.**

Now it's safe for you to ALT+TAB without worrying that your game will use half of your monitor's refresh rate when you gotta check something out.

I hope this helps some of you guys, now stay at home and game on!",0,1585421063,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqpw3k/i_found_a_fix_for_those_games_that_dont_use_your/,pcmasterrace,1

Also, a (possibly) separate Bluetooth question. I am having my wireless controller flit in and out of connectivity. Really annoying when playing unforgiving games. It seems to be linked to how the controller is positioned in my lap, but in either scenario, the controller is super close to the tower and essentially unobstructed, and my desk is made only of thin wood. Moreover, I have used a DS4 controller with a completely identical rig and never had these issues.

fqpeva,mavajo,Asus Z390-A - Boot failure after power is interrupted,"This is a new build.  Whenever power is interrupted to the PC (e.g., unplugging and then plugging it back in), it will not boot - red (CPU) light flashes once, yellow (DRAM) light flashes once, red light flashes again, yellow light flashes again, then nothing.  All hardware appears to be operating as normal, but no booting or signal to the monitors.  Problem appears to be fixed by resetting CMOS...until the next time power is interrupted.  Interestingly, restarting the computer does not appear to cause a problem - it only presents when power is interrupted.

Any ideas how to fix this permanently so that I don't have to reset CMOS every time power gets interrupted?  Other than this issue, the computer is working flawlessly.

Specs:

Windows 10 Home

Asus Prime Z390-A

Core i5-9400F

GeForce GTX 1070

Ripjaws V 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4-3600 PC4-28800

If it matters, the video card is a carryover from my previous PC.  All other components are new.

Edit:  From a crosspost elsewhere, my description of the power being 'interrupted' is apparently causing confusion -- sorry.  My description did not mean the plug is being randomly pulled.  I mean that even with a proper power down, if power is not continually fed, it will not boot up properly once it's plugged back in.  E.g., I power down the PC, switch it off, unplug it...move the computer somewhere else and plug it back in, it won't boot.",4,1585419548,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqpeva/asus_z390a_boot_failure_after_power_is_interrupted/,pcmasterrace,1

| i5-4460
| Gtx 1050ti with 4gb of vram
| 8gb ddr4
| Older msi motherboard where one of the dimm slots no longer works

I currently enjoy playing GTAV, warzone, no man's sky, Minecraft, and some other titles.

I'd also hope with this budget that I would start to be able to break into some VR.

fqp7hl,plz_sapnupuas,I need a game for my 60 year old dad to play.,"The other day I was chatting on the phone with my dad, and he just seems anxious about the whole Covid-19 thing. He needs a distraction and showed some interest in turning to video games for it. He is as competent as anyone with using a computer but hasn‚Äôt really played anything since the original Doom games. (I tried to get him to play the new Doom. Didn‚Äôt work)

At the moment, he has been into western themed movies and shows (actively watching westworld right now) and loves everything Quentin Tarantino. So I was thinking I could get him Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC. He has a theater room with a 135 inch projection screen and a ridiculous custom 7.1 sound system which would be amazing when matched with a game like that. 

The only problem is the computer I built for him about 5 years ago has a g4400 (duel core pentium). The computer is designed to be upgraded, so that can be done for ~$180 to get him into an i5 that can handle it and an extra 8gb if RAM. He already has a GTX970 I gave him when I upgrade my computer.

So with that, are there any other games that can run on his current setup that might be good for him to use as a getaway? He likely needs direction in games in the way where he is told to go here and do this thing now go over there and do that thing. Oh and given the setting he will be playing the game, he will need to use a controller.

If there aren‚Äôt any other good options, I‚Äôll pull the plug and upgrade his computer. Just looking for other options first though.",8,1585418896,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqp7hl/i_need_a_game_for_my_60_year_old_dad_to_play/,pcmasterrace,2

But over the past 6 months or so, I can't.  I usually use Fraps because it's simple and easy, but now it's just a black screen.  In some games, Fraps shows my FPS, but not all games.  I also tried a program called Chronolapse, but it was the same thing.  Then I tried a program called Autoscreen, and it *almost* works.  I've only tried it on Doom Eternal, and it just shows the pause screen.

It does this on almost all games lately, Cities: Skylines, Borderlands 2, Borderlands 3, and a whole bunch of Windows Game Pass games.  Only Stellaris worked, and that's not really a fun screenshot kinda game - I like the loading screens though, and that's all I took screenshots of.  Doesn't matter if I launch it through a launcher, like Steam or GOG Galaxy, or through a start menu, or if it's a less than legit game that I'm launching directly.

fqowz6,Ethan_NLHW,2080Ti Founders Edition Backplate Screws," 

So I put a waterblock on my 2080Ti FE card, and when reassembling the stock cooler for storage, one of the tiny little backplate screws (the ones that actually attach the backplate to the card) slipped out of my fingers and landed on my carpet. I have been looking for it for three days with no joy. While I know that the card would function with a missing backplate screw with no issues, my OCD is driving me crazy knowing that it is missing, and the implications about warranty/RMA. Does anybody know where I could find such a screw. Google seems to think that they are some proprietary M2.5 screw with an odd length and countersink, so they are near impossible to find at a hardware store. I emailed NVIDIA to ask about purchasing a handful of them, and they said they don't sell the parts separately. So no luck there. Other option is to buy a broken¬†older Founders Edition card for super cheap and just steal parts off of it, but I have no idea whether those old cards use the same hardware for assembly. I'd assume they would, but NVIDIA does dumb things sometimes. Any help is appreciated.

fqoui4,blazjeahh,Can you help me find problem with my PC? I don't know what to do anymore," 

Hey all. I hope you are doing well.

I have a problem with my PC. It's a difficult one and I will try to explain you every step I have taken.

**Operating System** Windows 10 Education 64-bit

**CPU** AMD Ryzen 5 2400GRaven Ridge 14nm Technology

**RAM** 1x8.00GB @ 232MHz (13-13-13-30)

**Motherboard** ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. PRIME A320M-K (AM4)

**Graphics** SAMSUNG (1360x768@60Hz)2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (NVIDIA)ATI AMD Radeon RX Vega 11 Graphics (ATI)

**Storage** 111GB PNY CS900 120GB SSD (SATA (SSD))930GB HDD

**Audio** Realtek High Definition Audio

**LINK TO SPECCY**: [https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28](https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28)

PC was bought 2 years ago and it already started freezing very rarely from the start.I ignored it and hoped it would stop in the future.

When the problem occurs, computer completely hard freezes. The audio and screen stops. I can't even move the mouse or turn on caps/num/scroll lock on the keyboard.I thought the problem was in my old HDD from 2007. It was the only old component and I bought a new one. The freeze was STILL there after replacement.

I was not playing games in the first 2 years. The freeze happened sometimes when the movie was playing or when randomly browsing internet.Recently, I started gaming and that's when the freezes started occuring more frequently.**They are totally random and it can happen when I start the game or hours and hours in playtime.** I use Discord while gaming if that's important.

Under **Display adapters,** PC says there is an error with my Ryzen 5 Vega integrated graphics not working properly and to check problem **code 43**.  
I don't know if that's causing the problem.

**Things I've tried:**

\- fresh reinstalled Windows

\- installed newest drivers for most of the components

\- disabled integrated GPU in BIOS (there is no way to disable it, I only set my primary display device to Nvidia)

\- using DDU to uninstall all my Nvidia and AMD drivers and then reinstalling ONLY Nvidia driver (newest and older recommended version) - nothing changed and PC still saying theres a problem with my integrated graphics

\- tried changing power from balanced to high performance

\- testing RAM on MemTest86, the test lasted for like 2-3 hours and it said everything is fine

\- CrystalDiskInfo and CrystalDiskMark said my HDD and SSD are healthy

\- scanned for malware

\- System file checker - when I typed sfc /scannow, my computer completely froze 2 times and after **chkdsk** finished, the sfc /scannow completed and said there were no errors

\- tested GPU with FurMark - everything was fine with the temperatures

\- tested CPU with Prime95 - I can't run it for even 15 mins and my CPU temperature quickly rises to more than 85 ¬∞C and I shut it down. I disabled AVX. The CPU fan is working normally.",10,1585417780,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqoui4/can_you_help_me_find_problem_with_my_pc_i_dont/,pcmasterrace,1
fqou3q,nickadooodle,"My PC struggles with every game suddenly, help!","So my PC used to run games like Warzone and Rainbow Six Siege. Then, I installed a new CPU fan to fix the rising temperatures and the games would not crash and could be played perfectly, with high settings too. Recently I had an issue meaning I had to unplug and re plug in everything from my motherboard and now all my games crash. Also, everything uses a lot of CPU power and uses Very High power usage. Every cable is plugged in properly, that I am aware of and so I am unsure what's causing the horrible usage of my computer.

TL;dr:
My computer could run these games perfectly before, but after resitting things into my motherboard, the games crash. All cables are plugged in properly.",2,1585417751,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqou3q/my_pc_struggles_with_every_game_suddenly_help/,pcmasterrace,1

I've opened up my case, cleaned out the dust, checked to make sure the GPU wasn't loose, but so far nothing has changed.

I'll probably have to save up for a new graphics card (I hope that it's just that anyway) but I thought I'd check here to see if anyone had some other ideas.

started having a problem with my pc lately by encountering lower fps than usual.

problem started around 5 days ago. one morning i boot up my pc to play witcher 3, didn't do anything unusual with my pc (started it and launched the game staight away like always) and noticed lower fps than normal. before i was playing on max settings and was getting 80-120fps, now i get 60-100fps with rare fps drops down to 40 (where there is a lot of NPC's). checked my cpu and gpu temperatures - everything fine. then i checked my drivers and they were up to date. thing is, i updated my drivers on 23 march so basically the same day when my issues started. could it be the new drivers? i did reinstall them but the issue persisted. checked other games like forza horizon 4 and red dead redemption 2 and the fps was lower by 20 on both games. checked task manager for any other apps runnig but didn't find anything. what could it be? is it a hardware of software related problem?

fqols5,GenericUserino,AMD Wattman keeps crashing/ resetting mid-game,"Hello fellow Redditors!

I have had this issue for a few months now: Whenever i set-up a custom profile in wattman through the Radeon software, the profile keeps resetting itself without user input during gameplay/ other random tasks. Whenever the profile gets reset, MSI Afterburner also closes itself.

I have installed MSI afterburner and RTSS, but this issue appeared before those were installed as well.

Upon searching the web for possible fixes i stumbled some older threads which tell me to change my windows power settings and disable fast boot. I did disable fastboot, in windows as well as in my bios settings, but this does not seem to have any effect on the constant crashing.

If anyone of you has an idea of how to fix this, i would greatly appreciate your comment, thanks!

fqoacl,Daneity,Custom Built PC Bluetooth doesn't work? Can't figure out what's wrong.,"A couple months ago, I built a PC (specs below), and I just found a problem with the Bluetooth connectivity. Whenever I try to connect any device via Bluetooth, it will establish either a temporary connection and then immediately disconnect, or it will say the device is connected, but it will not actually function.

For example, when I tried to connect my Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones via Bluetooth to the PC, it says that it is briefly connected, but immediately disconnects. When I tried to play Spotify through the headphones during the brief connection period, the sound came out incredibly distorted and choppy for around 15 seconds, then simply no sound came out, almost as if it had been disconnected again. This same exact issue happened when I tried to connect a Google Home Mini over Bluetooth.

Also, when I attempted to connect a Dualshock 4 PS4 controller (bluetooth compatible, I believe) through Bluetooth, it says ""paired"" in the Bluetooth menu of my PC, but I cannot use the controller whatsoever.

Has anyone encountered these sorts of errors, or does anybody know the solution to the issue?

Basically I just copied the PCMR budget build. I changed the SSD because that seemed like an amazing deal for 2 TB, and the video card because it seemed like a similar part with about half the price (that's the change I am more hesitant about). Extreme graphics are not my biggest concern, as I have been playing with a dust-filled, largely broken laptop for the last two years. I mostly play Paradox grand strategy titles, though RDR 2 with modest graphics is my goal.

fqndyl,Dyionisus,Computer keeps shutting down on certain games after upgrading GPU,"Hi all, 

Recently I upgraded my pre-build pc (XPS 8700) with a new graphics card (GTX 1660 Super). 

About a week after upgrading the pc started to randomly shutdown whenever I play certain games. However I can't find out why this is. I've since replaced the PSU and done multiple software updates and looked on the internet for possible fixes but nothing seems to help. The type of games that cause the shutdown seem very random as well. 

Games it can't handle: Apex, League of Legends, Stronghold legends, Age of Mythology, Minecraft. 

Games it has no problems with: Risk of rain 2, Assasins' creed Odysee, Dying light, Civilization 6. 

If I don't use any of the games I mentioned above the pc works mostly great and almost never shuts down. But if I play those games, within anything of 1 minute to 2 hours my pc shuts down.

fqmxb5,ReformedG,Trying to Upgrade my GPU but I am confused,"Hello, I built a PC a long time ago with some help so I don't know that much. I am just trying to upgrade my GPU right now because I am having some trouble running games that I wish to play. 

My PC is quite old, about 5-6 years. I have a GA z97X - Gaming - 3 motherboard. 

The current GPU i have is a GTX 750 Ti, I wanted to upgrade it to GTx 1660 , but I don't know if that is compatible with my motherboard. 

I am using a HP 23xi as my monitor.

If that isn't can you please recommend me some that are compatible and would be good to have in this current time of gaming. Something that would suffice and allow me to run newer games even if it isnt on the best settings. 

For example: Currently I want to run the Warzone game but I cannot run it. 

Also any other upgrades you might think i need would be greatly appreciated.

Sorry if I have left out any information, I am limited in my knowledge with this but I can try to find to more information if you need it.

fqmrdm,chipchipjack,Tricking games into thinking I have different GPU," 

I have a dell Inspiron 15 5570 with a Intel Core i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz and an Intel HD620 GPU with 2GB of VRAM\*. I am about to upgrade my memory from 1x8GB to 2x8GB to somewhat improve the iGPU performance. I can currently run Apex Legends at a smooth 25-40FPS on the lowest resolution with resolution de-scaling turned on.

My problem comes from the new Modern Warfare title, I see people with Ryzen APU's getting very playable frames with only single channel memory and I would love to play some Warzone with the boys, however a few months ago when it was released I purchased MW (Modern Warfare) and upon launch I get an error stating ""The game couldn't start because your graphics processing unit (GPU) is not supported"". I have been thinking to myself since then trying to find a solution without avail, that is until Warzone released and gave me a second wind. I then remembered all of those LTT videos about scammers selling something like a GeForce GTX 670 as a 970, when those are plugged to the mobo they show up on the PC as an actual 970 even though they are 670's. How does one do this?

My proposed solution is to somehow edit the Intel HD620's signature to trick MW into thinking that I have a supported GPU such as a 1050 so I can at least get into the game to tweak settings and experiment for frames.

I would also very much like information such as how will this affect things like my computers normal running condition, driver updates, and stability as this is also the computer I use for school.

\*I technically have 2GB of operating video memory from RAM with my iGPU and more after the memory upgrade

fqmacw,Albatraous,Need advice on what needs to be upgraded first.,"I have currently the following:

CPU : Intel i5-6400 @2.7ghz
Motherboard: Z170X-Gaming 5
GPU: NVIDIA GTX 970
RAM: 16 GB
PSU: 820w

I can run Doom Eternal fine with only a few settings turned down (just to keep it towards 60fps, whilst not having full ant-aliasing etc). However, running VR (Oculus Rift S) it works fine for the most part, but it struggles sometimes with Boneworks, and even at times Beat Saber will have some lag. 

I tried Half-Life Alyx and it basically falls over at the first scene on the first level. I know, my fault for not looking at the requirements. However, my pc is below the spec for Boneworks and this works ok.

I am occasionally having random reboots in 3dMark every time, and sometimes in VR, which I have been told could be a PSU issue. 

But I digress. If I upgrade the CPU, will I need to change the motherboard?

If I upgrade the GPU, will this CPU still cause the performance issues due to the bottleneck?

I don't have a lot of money, kind of thinking of getting the GPU up to an RTX 2060 Super, but I know very little about the current situation with CPU's.

Which CPU would be a good match for the above card, that isn't going to put a massive dent in my budget?

I am trying to save up to ¬£500 for the two items (the GPU I can get for around ¬£350), though if I need extra, then obviously I'll have to save more.

Thanks for any advice you can give. I've been a bit out of the loop of what CPU's and GPU's are good, other than knowing RTX is an amazing feature.",2,1585409455,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqmacw/need_advice_on_what_needs_to_be_upgraded_first/,pcmasterrace,1

fqm0km,_69,Trying to troubleshoot after my cat viciously attacked my Diet Coke,"Hi guys, so yesterday my cat spilled a bit of Diet Coke through the top fan of my Z9 Plus Zalman case, the comp was running for a good 10seconds while I was putting the can back up but I managed to switch it off the power supply manually before anything seemed to short. After, I gave it a good 10mins blow drying with cool air (in hindsight this was pretty stupid and impatient of me, but hey ho we make mistakes in the heat of things) through the case and replaced my CPU fan with another one I had next morning, since it was slightly sticky and with the dust collecting it made for it not spinning properly. I couldn‚Äôt see any coke on the actual MOBO and it mainly looked like it dropped onto the heat sink/fan. I tried starting today and everything was powered properly - CPU/Case fans, GPU, so I know the MOBO is getting power and seems to be distributing it fine. But there were no beeps/error LEDs and the system wouldn‚Äôt even boot BIOS. I tried removing RAM sticks, putting them in one at a time, trying different slots (since this was a recommended course of action according to google) but this didn‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôve also tried connecting HDMI to integrated gfx incase my comp was booting in safe mode, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case either. I have an ASROCK Z77 extreme 4 and tried looking online to buy one but in the UK I can‚Äôt seem to find a vendor (the Mobo is from the original build and is pretty old so I imagine they‚Äôre not manufactured anymore) and my next step is to look for a MOBO that can support my components (i5 3570k, 1650 super, ddr3). I know the cpu and memory is old and I actually bought a ryzen 5 series and ddr4 alongside an ASROCK B450 Pro4 MOBO, but ryzen 5 doesn‚Äôt work with my existing windows 7 which was a problem I was going to try and solve before I my cat decided to spray my pc with soft drinks. The i5 3570k isn‚Äôt compatible with my new Mobo so I can‚Äôt test to see if the z77 extreme 4 is the problem or if it‚Äôs to do with something else. So I have this situation where I have a bunch of pc parts at my disposal but none of them work with eachother coherently and just wanted opinions on what you guys would you if you were in this situation.

My job requires 2 monitors so since I already have a PC I figured I'd treat myself and picked up a brand new Asus VG278. I took out one of my other monitors and hooked it up to the display port. Fire it up, adjust settings, make sure its operating at 165hz. Great. After work is over I decided to really test it out with some Doom 2016 (i never finished it to start eternal). The game fires up on the old monitor. I change the new display to primary. Still on the other monitor, I restart my computer,  the same. I went into big picture, no option to choose monitor. I started other games and they use the new monitor just fine. I unplugged the old one and start Doom. It starts but is very pixelated and won't adjust to fit the screen. Any input would be helpful.

fqlrlz,ICE_NorthBorn,Making the switch from Xbox to PC in 2020?,"I‚Äôm curious about how well the switch from Xbox to PC went for the people who did it recently because I‚Äôm debating on doing it myself. Should I?

Reasons why I think I want one:

‚Ä¢ The games Xbox doesn‚Äôt have; like Rust, a more stable version of DayZ, all sorts or survival games, stuff like that. 

‚Ä¢ Performance/Graphics 

Reasons why I think I shouldn‚Äôt get one:

‚Ä¢  I consider myself a skilled player for most of the games I play. Half of that is the way I think but the other half is my accuracy. If I make the switch to mouse and keyboard I know I‚Äôll be suffering for a while before I can climb back up, and I‚Äôm uncertain I‚Äôll ever be as good as I would be with a controller on Xbox.

‚Ä¢ I have two good friends on Xbox who I play with almost daily. Not sure if they will make the switch with me 

‚Äî‚Äî

As you can see, the reasons to stay with Xbox seem greater than the reasons to go to PC. Am I missing some things? Tell me what you think or your experiences with the conversion!
I like the aspect of building a PC. Money isn‚Äôt that big of a factor, I could go for a higher end build right off the hop.

I left my pc off for a few days while I was staying with my girlfriend. I had it connected to my monitor (DP) and my tv (HDMI). While it was off, I unplugged my HDMI to pack it and take it with me. 

I then switched my pc on. The motherboard rgbs and GPU lights came on as normal and the fans started up. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I then noticed my keyboard and mouse were off and my monitor couldn't find a connection. 

I assumed this was because I I unplugged the HDMI? And that I just needed to switch it off, unplug some cables, switch it back on and it would resolve itself. 

So I unplugged my keyboard, mouse, DP cable and power cable. Then switched it back on and plugged them back in. Still nothing.

I'm concerned that it's something serious - possibly PSU related because I'm not getting power to my keyboard and mouse?

I am wondering how that would match up to newer games and if it would be worth going for cheaper GPU (since its the most pricey thing, but I would still want to run new games at high setting) Other than that I am hoping I could get a general rating of the build (even though its from the PCMR site) and any cations, or things I missed.   
From the PC part picker, I also got this warning: AMD B450 chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using Matisse CPUs.

fqkcvx,avers122,NVMe build with ssd or hdd?,Hello r/Pcmasterrace. So I'm trying to price out a build for an audio production pc that will probably be used for gaming on the side. The build I had in mind for awhile would've been something like a 500GB SSD and 1tb HDD but now that nvme has come along and is affordable I've changed that. I'm pretty set on taking advantage of the new NVMe drives for my operating system and DAW. But if I already have the NMVe drive(500gb) do I need an SSD or should I just get a HDD? I'm not totally sure and was just hoping for some clarity from some of you fine folks.

Hello,

I  decided to upgrade my motherboard, my CPU and my RAM. At first i thought about these components:

&amp;#x200B;

A.

Motherboard:  MSI B450M PRO-DH MAX, AM4 SOCKET;

Cpu: AMD Ryzen 5 2600, 3.9GHz, 19 MB, AM4 Socket, Wraith Stealth cooler;

RAM:  Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DIMM, DDR4, 3000 MHz, CL15, 1.35V, XMP 2.0.

&amp;#x200B;

After today's morning, I thought about the following components:

&amp;#x200B;

B.

Motherboard: NO IDEA. I would like something budget friendly.

CPU:  AMD Ryzen 5 3600, 35 MB, 4.2 GHz with Wraith Stealth cooler;

RAM: I really don t know. Should i go for 3000 MHz or 3200 Mhz?

#                    

I would like some recommendation for the new, better setup B and, if the price is too high, i would like to know if i can make some upgrades to the A list. I don t know what i am doing when it comes to motherboards/ram. I heard that if i go with the A's motherboard and with the B's cpu, i would need to update my bios (?).

fqjhyj,Terminal-Psychosis,Old IBM Thinkpad t41 gets re-thunk! - 2013,"Something written back in 2013. The tech has changed so much, but the never ending love for it, stays the same:

----------

 I don't like to throw things away, so when someone put this old IBM Thinkpad t41 (2373) in my lap I had to give it an honest try. Can I get this old laptop to work again, and actually be useful?



 The old girl came from a friend of a friend. It was crashing a lot, would not connect to the WLan anymore, and was just generally slow and painful to use. Windows XP Pro was installed, probably as it came from the factory.


 First try was to put XP SP3 in, and it did install, but didn't help any of the problems. Ok let's see... Downloaded all drivers (thankfully IBM, now Lenovo, still has them online!) 

http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/research/hints-or-tips/detail.page?&amp;DocID=HT063351


  A fresh install of WinXP Pro, all drivers in except.. ugg, it is still crashing regularly, and wlan is still VERY iffy.  Time to dig deeper. What BIOS version does it have?  Wow, Ancient Technology! Ok, bios update and... it refuses to boot with an 1802 error. The WLan mini-pc card is not supported. A little research and I find IBM had locked out anything but their own official hardware on the wireless front. BOO! Thankfully, there are some clever people out there, so after flashing the no-1802.iso patch it booted again and happily used the Broadcom card. One problem down, but things were still not as they should have been.


  It worked, better than before, but was still very shaky on it's feet. Firefox would crash randomly, even on very simple websites. Trying to get an antivirus program installed was a huge headache, constantly giving errors. What is going on here!?!   hmmm How much ram do we have? 512MB. I wonder....  2x 256 and they are DDR1-333MHz. I grabbed the newest 4.20 version of Memtest86+ as a bootable .iso cd image and what do you know, half way through the screen goes crazy red, error messages flowing like a waterfall. We might be on to something here.


  One of the memory slots is under the laptop, the other is harder to get to, under the keyboard. I took out both sticks of ram and put in a stick of 128MB I had, that I am confident is good. This stick also gave an error, but just 1. I ran the test again, and it came up clean.  Strange. Next I tried one stick at a time of the original, in the slot underneath. Individually they were ok.  I'm still not sure what was up with this. I have a feeling, sitting in there all those years that the connections got a little cruddy. No proof for this, but my hunch is that just the pulling out and in rubbed the pin contacts enough that they connected again. Both sticks back in, as original, and this time Memtest came out clean as a whistle.


  512MB of ram is painful these days, where even a web browser can use upwards to 100MB or more. Time for a small upgrade. 2x 1GB ram sticks were found. Killer deal on Amazon, of all places! Cost about 40 for both (and free shipping). Threw them in, memtest run again just to make sure, and all is well.



 Currently I am sitting in front of an ancient piece of technology. Something from the stone ages really. 1.5GHz CPU, 40GB HDD, and more RAM than it knows what to do with. This little IBM has never been happier. Surfing away, and running rock solid. Videos, Music, even some re-coding of vid files, intensive stuff. It purrs away and is useful again. I do believe it will continue to be.

This laptop was a faithful friend for a few years longer. then got another ""broken"" one that was far, far better and passed this one on to the child of a friend (with linux this time).

I left my pc off for a few days while I was staying with my girlfriend. I had it connected to my monitor (DP) and my tv (HDMI). While it was off, I unplugged my HDMI to pack it and take it with me. 

I then switched my pc on. The motherboard rgbs and GPU lights came on as normal and the fans started up. Nothing out of the ordinary here. I then noticed my keyboard and mouse were off and my monitor couldn't find a connection. 

I assumed this was because I I unplugged the HDMI? And that I just needed to switch it off, unplug some cables, switch it back on and it would resolve itself. 

So I unplugged my keyboard, mouse, DP cable and power cable. Then switched it back on and plugged them back in. Still nothing.

I'm concerned that it's something serious - possibly PSU related because I'm not getting power to my keyboard and mouse?

Many  people still don't know that YOU can help in the ongoing research to  find effective treatments for Covid-19. In fact, YOU are in the best  position to do so.

There's a project called ""folding@home"" and they are currently prioritizing Covid-19 simulations: [https://youtu.be/RGGzMQ2oFrA](https://youtu.be/RGGzMQ2oFrA)

So, tldr of last post: I changed my old psu with a Focus Gx 550w one (I was told my psu was good enough for my specs). I assumed I got a virus that somehow bypassed my Antivirus, since I woke up without Windows. I went into the BIOS, it read my drives. I assumed the malware yeeted off of my pc the os. I plugged in my USB Stick with w10 in it, required around 100 restarts to finally read it and go on with the installation. It was nearly done, required a restart and then froze on the windows installation logo.

Updates: Changed my HDD and it booted up in windows, except my Keyboard and Mouse were not working with that hdd.

My conclusion: PSU may have fried my drives? Not sure! My pc still reads them. Is my psu not enough? I dont OC anything in my pc",0,1585394041,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqi90r/update_on_my_major_potential_malwarewindowsdrives/,pcmasterrace,1

I own a HP Open Laptop, it's not a beast, I know, but I'm trying to upgrade it.

- i5-8300H processor (but it's weird, apparently i5s should have three cores and three virtual cores, but it has four cores and four virtual cores)
- GTX 1050 2 GB
- 8 GB of RAM

I just looked up how to upgrade a laptop, and it seems that the RAM is one of the easiest (and possible) upgrades to make, so I was thinking that replacing the current one with a 12GB/16GB RAM would help with performance.

* AMD Ryzen 5 1600
* EVGA GeForce GTX 1060 SC GAMING, ACX 2.0 (Single Fan), 6GB GDDR5, DX12 OSD Support (PXOC) Graphics card 06G-P4-6163-KR

* two SSDs (120G, 2TB) and one HDD (2TB)

Essentially, I'm hoping to do a new build from scratch this year but I'm pretty rusty and not as familiar with the newest hardware out there. I wanted to see if any of you fine masters would maybe be able to give any pointers or direction to a place that I might be able to brush up my knowledge. I went on PC Part Picker and was pretty overwhelmed with the options. I didn't know where to start with all of the spec options.

I would say my budget is around 3 to 4 thousand. I want to also try liquid cooling as it would be my first time so I am not knowledgeable of what kind of specs to look for.

I know this might seem like a pretty broad request but any tips or thoughts would be welcomed. Thank you!

fqg1wz,ApprehensiveSwan,i7-8700 (Non-K) Power limit throttling w/ no limits set,"Hello! I have looked elsewhere on this issue and have found inconclusive solutions, so I am bringing it here. With my CPU at idle (\~2 - 3% utilization), it will randomly power throttle. I know there is an option in most BIOS's to address the CPU current limit, but my options are greyed out (MSI B360-A PRO w/ stock BIOS). Within Intel XTU, My short power max and turbo max are set to unlimited (for testing) and turbo boost power time is set to 128 seconds (max). I have a 1000 watt Rosewill 80+ power supply and a GTX 1080ti in my rig, so there should be plenty of headroom for my CPU. The thing is, this current limit is kind of random. It fluctuates my core clock randomly but under a Cinebench R15 load (\~ 107 watts) it is still just as unpredictable as at idle. I can confirm that this is not just a false reading but indeed underclocking my core because I can see them go down in real time in XTU. I will attach screenshots of the XTU window at idle and with Cinebench running. UPDATE: well, this is anticlimactic, when I went to get screenshots for this post my CPU will not go over 99 watts nor power throttle (or get a decent Cinebench score relative to my old runs). I swear lol :p. Anyway, that may be why my screenshots are inconsistent w/ my above issues, but I can assure this is still an issue. Thanks!

So I had just built my PC a week ago and ever since then I‚Äôve had crazy static on my mic. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling audio drivers, using an old headset, and using the front and back audio jacks but nothing made it go away. I tested my headset on his PC before and I didn‚Äôt hear static so I thought it was just my computer. I even plugged my PC into an outlet that has a ground prong and I had static so I thought it was for sure my PC being the problem. Well fast forward to today and I was troubleshooting his PC and I noticed that he had static too! It was nowhere near as bad as mine though. His is tolerable but I have to use noise suppression so people can hear me properly. So, could the static come from not having grounded outlets? And could the ‚Äúgrounded‚Äù outlet I plugged my PC into not be properly grounded? Also I‚Äôd like to add that on my prebuilt that I had for 3 days, there was no static whatsoever on the same outlet with the same power strip.

https://valid.x86.fr/t447jx

Ignore the temp, average idle is about 29C, and average gaming (lately it's been CODMW, max settings, 90 fps avg, 1440p), it's been peaking at 78, though never crossed to 80.

Ram is seating in slots 3, 4, 7, 8. 
This is the only configuration that recognizes all 32gb, or boots, idk why.

https://i.imgur.com/x2HeMzw.png

(Ignore the C drive, I'm running a virus scan because I'm so fucking bored).

I recently applied new paste to the cpu, some of the old paste flaked off when I was removing it that it fell under the CPU lid. I took the CPU out of the socket to spray the flake out. I did accidently bend 4-5 pins in the socket because my microfiber cloth got snagged somehow. I legit don't know how because it was fully in my hand. The pins didn't bend against eachother or even out of the way, they're just kinda... moved? Everything has been booting and running fine.

I've been using this rig for about 6 months, and I got it 2nd hand for $350, except the drives and GPU. There's some sad story I didn't wanna ask about, but it was sold by some old guy and it had only been used for maybe 3-4 days, before it was packed away and eventually sold to me. So I didn't put it together, the only parts I've swapped were the drives and GPU. Case says IBUYPOWER, but it looks doesn't look like they put it together, if they did it was rather sloppy.

I've looked into purchasing the parts individually and it seems as though it's only $100-$150 less expensive than ordering one pre-built.  As I consider myself well versed in the technical areas of computers I know I am not even close to where I should be to build my own PC.  Given that,  I currently  have a 2016 Razer Blade 15 (Intel i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz; 16 GB RAM; NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060; 500 GB SSD) so naturally, I want something comparable/better than that for a desktop PC.  This PC (yes I know it's a laptop) has served me very well for the past 4 year but I believe it's time for an upgrade via a desktop. I was trying to keep it under $1,500 but with the specs that I have been seeing, I haven't yet been convinced.    I currently am looking at a PC build from NZXT that has the following specs:

**Case**: NZXT H510i

**GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER - MSI VENTUS GP OV

**CPU**: Intel Core i7-G9700F 8-Core 3.0 GHz

**CPU Cooling**: NZXT Kraken M22

**MOTHERBOARD**: MSI MPG Z390 GAMING EDGE AC

**RAM**: Team T-FORCE Delta RGB Delta RGB 16 GB 3.200 MHz

**SSD**: Intel 660p 2.0 TB

**POWER**: Seasonic S12III 650W Bronze

\- 2 AOC G2590FX Monitors

* 144 hz

\- Razer Huntsman Keyboard

\-Logitech Anywhere 2S Mouse

fqejfd,KylAnde01,I actually get higher fps using windows borderless in MW: Warzone... cons?," 

quick PC tech question.

When  I run in full screen borderless mode my fps takes a 10\~15fps boost.  Stable too. I discovered this when the game settings changed themselves  automatically. I had sudden fps boost in a game and checked the options  to see what happened. It switched to fullscreen borderless at max  resolution and rendered down slightly. I didnt notice much in the change  of quality except that my fps was a steady 60\~75 at all times. I also havent done any extensive comparisons, but I was playing well without noticing any changes for awhile.

Everything  I've read said that fullscreen borderless should slow down and limit  your fps big time by running through the desktop, why am I the opposite?  Are their any other cons to running this display? Maybe some input  delay from the mouse/keyboard to the game from running through the  desktop? I've tried finding more info on this little phenomenon but  haven't had any luck.

Cheers.

I installed a new graphics card first and everything was fine with my audio for a few days. Then my motherboard and processor came in. After installing them an old problem that I had before with my Razer Kraken Pro V2 (not USB, it's the 3.5 mm stereo/audio split cable) resurfaced, all my game audio, music or YouTube video audio now plays through my microphone/headset and all my friends can hear it clearly in Discord. I checked if it was just Discord by recording myself, it was there as well. I've tried different headsets to no avail (Man O' War's and an old junky headset I had lying around). 

&amp;#x200B;

My PC Spec's are as follows:

\- Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060

\- ASUS Tuf Gaming X570-plus (motherboard)

\- AMD Ryzen 7 3700x

The problem didn't arise until after I installed the processor and motherboard. I installed the proper drivers for the motherboard and graphics card, I tried updating the Realtek Audio Drivers I have.. I tried rolling back the drivers, I tried everything I could find online. Long ago there was an enhancements tab in the sound control panel for my recording/playback devices but that's nowhere to be found after some windows update. My last ditch effort was just completely factory resetting my computer like I should have after making big hardware changes. I literally have nothing installed other than the drivers that came with the motherboard and my updated graphics drivers and I still have the problem.

fqdk7k,Urshifu_Smash,"I've been thinking for quite a while about building my own rig, but how do you deal with incompatabilities, wires, and the system setup problems?","It seems like more can go wrong than right. I'll admit that I know almost nothing about how to put one together. Every part I pick, there is a voice in the back of my head saying ""you could do better"" or ""you are over spending!"" I've watched 4 or 5 build videos, but they talk about needing to update BIOs or something and installing drivers, but how do you know which ones are right? 

   And then the wires. What's the difference between modular and regular? How am I supposed to manage my cables when I can't even tell where they are supposed to be plugged in? 

   And the setup part. Even if it DOES turn on by some miracle, all that information and prompts and installing fan speed regulator and double checking all of these different parts working at maximum capacity. Then you have to have a previous computer to get windows 10 installed. Which drivers do I install there are like 30.

   I'm really willing to push through the problems. It's being alone and the fear that I will run into a problem that the videos just gloss over like ""just install the correct BIOs if it doesn't work."" Like dude what?! Or if i lose a screw. Or if the airflow is sub-optimal. Everyone on this sub acts like it's no big deal, but it looks like if I dont ground myself throughout the build it could fry it or something? While also keeping in mind which wires need a firm push and other ones just need to be glided in. But also the fact that my parts might not be the same parts used in a build video, how do I even follow along? Keep in mind my price range is &gt;900 but &lt;2000.

My overall question is, how do you know what you are doing right and what could end up causing your computer to not run at normal capacity in turn ""wasting money""?",6,1585370800,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqdk7k/ive_been_thinking_for_quite_a_while_about/,pcmasterrace,1

fqd3m8,xjrsc,PC not booting after nvidia driver install.,"I had issues with 444.75 driver so I uninstalled and went to the previous version using ddu. Today I hear they released a HotFix 444.78 so I updated. All was fine but I had the same lighting glitches that I had in 444.75 in Monster hunter. So I go back to the previous driver before 444.75. using ddu.

After doing this my PC started to run insanely slow, windows was fine, still at 144hz but any applications that had anything to do with graphics caused the computer to go at a snails pace.

So I figure I should do a full uninstall of the driver then reinstall but now the computer won't boot. I think it's because I have wallpaper engine to automatically load.

Anyone have suggestions? I was thinking of unplugging my D drive where wallpaper engine is installed and just leaving the C drive in.

My budget is $1500-1700; I'd be willing to spend around $200 more if I'm it's worth the improvement in hardware but if not necessary I'd like to stay towards the $1500 mark.  Also I would be buying the CPU/Motherboard and GPU at Microcenter which would save me around $105 guaranteed at this point of time. Thanks in advance!

First, I've never built a keyboard. This would be my first time, if its even possible to do exactly what I want.

So I guess lets cover what I'm looking for? Recently my trusty blackwidow died. My work (game programmer) bought me a new mechanical keyboard, but it doesn't have macro keys. Didn't think I'd miss them that much but I do... and for the dumbest reason, I just rebound Home and End to macro keys next to tab cause its way more convenient for me and I hit those a LOT while programming.

What I want to make, is a tenkeyless with a single row of programmables on the left side of the keyboard. I'm not dead set on it being a single row, I am dead set on it being on the left. If I they aren't next to tab it ain't worth it.

Does a PCB like that even exist? or am I better off giving up and getting a simple 5 key macro PCB and just... setting it on the left side of my keyboard kinda lined up with it.",6,1585367322,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqcqdq/looking_for_advice_on_building_a_keyboard/,pcmasterrace,1

cpu and mobo power cables are plugged in, along with the the front panel connector and cpu fan power. motherboard lights up and all fans spin until i manually turn it off. 

a faulty cpu was my first guess, but i realized that the front panel would not work unless my cpu was in its socket as well.

my second guess was a faulty cord, but i‚Äôve tried multiple with no luck. both display port, and hdmi fail to show an image.

i also tried both ram sticks, in both slots, one at a time, no luck.

the motherboard was used, so i tried taking out the battery and reinserting it to reset the bios, still nothing.

fqc8cw,IronicWhiteTrash,I7 reuse?,"       TL:DR Is my I7-7700 out of date or could i reuse it in my new build?


 A recent trip to the closest Microcenter looking at parts the employee helping me asked me what i was looking for and asked me what my current setup is. Being new to PC gaming i bought a pre-owned Facebook Marketplace HP Omen pre-build (i know, ahould have built one, I will build one next time) and picked one up for 500 dollars. He asked me the parts and i said 1070 and an I7-7700, and he said ""ah ok, well what are ya looking for?"" And i said that i was there looking just at parts maybe buy an ssd because i did not have one at the time, but i was intrested in something better then a 1070 but i would need a bigger PSU to push power too it. He told me that the 1070 shouldn't have any issue with anything right now especially at 1080p. That mostly if i wanted to upgrade i should do the a full new build minus hard drives. That the biggest thing holding me back was my CPU. Well when i was gonna build a new one i was just going to reuse the I7 and mostly go for the Case, PSU, and GPU. So the question I have for the masses is he correct is my I7 out of date.",10,1585365249,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqc8cw/i7_reuse/,pcmasterrace,1

I'm thinking of playing video games with them after school in order for them to de-stress and have fun. Initially, I was thinking the educational version of Minecraft but my school is not eligible for it. Does anyone have any recommendations? I have some requirements/preferences:  
* Free - I don't want my students to spend money on a game since a lot of them come from low-income areas. If anyone knows of any paid games that I can get access to as an educator, that would be great too.  
* Low spec - A lot of students don't have access to gaming PCs, so something low spec is ideal. I'm open to games that on phones/tablets too  
* Appropriate for school - I guess this rules out most shooters  
* Moderation - Since I would still be a teacher and they are students, there would need to be some sort of moderation tools on my end  
* Preferably not on Steam since I don't want to add students on my Steam account

fqaa4q,jaredjanuary,Something is Bottlenecking my GPU (GTX 1080),"Hi all,

Recently ran a userbenchmark as my PC has been acting up recently. Pretty bad frame drops in Fortnite trying to run as close to 240fps as possible. Basically when I play for over an hour, I get unplayable stutters which only resolve after setting to windowed mode and then back to fullscreen.

The longer my PC stays on, the poorer my GPU seems to perform.

I just ran a userbenchmark and attached the results: https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25920933

I've already used DDU to clean install the latest drivers. I've updated my BIOs to the latest too.

All my specs are included in the following benchmark: https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25920933

It should also be noted that sometimes when the GPU is busy struggling, my PC will go into a sleep-like state where the RGB is still on but the display and fans are off.

My current theory is that it is either PSU or motherboard related.

Any help appreciated! If I can solve this within the confines of my own home that would be fantastic.",6,1585357857,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fqaa4q/something_is_bottlenecking_my_gpu_gtx_1080/,pcmasterrace,1

There are instructions, but I'm not sure if there are changes that may happened with Nvidia Graphics Drivers being newer and what not.

Has anyone here used it recently? Was there ""extra steps"" not indicated on the forum?

* GTX 670

I recently discovered a program / patch that will allow you to run different graphics cards in SLI.

It's called [differentSLIauto](https://www.techpowerup.com/forums/threads/sli-with-different-cards.158907/). However, I'm a little hesitant because I'm not sure what I need to do exactly. There are instructions, but I'm not sure if there are changes that may happened with Nvidia Graphics Drivers being newer and what not.

Has anyone here used it recently? Was there ""extra steps"" not indicated on the forum?

I would like this to work, but I figured I would ask Reddit before proceed to ""tinker"" with it.

Any advice on this would be appreciated :)

I used PeaZip (basically 7-zip for Linux) but that didn't work as I had hoped. I used the keyfile option and I thought it would work as something like a recovery file in case of a forgotten password but no, to unzip the file you needed both the password and the keyfile.

For the past week I've been trying to figure out why my SSD's are just refusing to work properly.

I was gifted two Samsung Evo 256GB SSD's from my GF's dad who works in IT and has a lot of SSD's laying around. I was planning on making these into my Important Steam games Library for some fast loading and whatnot. My initial plan was to create a Spanned Drive to combine the two drives into one 512GB SSD so It'd be easier to manage my library. I did this through Disk Management.

Everything seems to be working fine for a bit until I try to install a game onto my now one drive. All of a sudden my game stops downloading and Steam gives me a message saying ""An error occured while installing Dark souls II (disk write error):"" and my Spanned drives are now saying something like Healthy(Error) which I don't really know what that means. Since its healthy and giving me errors?

So I do this for a couple days reformatting and re-spanning my drives but the same exact thing keeps happening. Its working perfectly fine, I install a game, I get an error halfway through and then My spanned drives are giving me an error.

So Im thinking that one or both drives are iffy. I completely reinstall my drives and create a new volume but this time I found that you can do a chkdsk and it'll tell you if there are any bad sectors on your drives. But both drives gave me 0 errors and it was all good. So I try installing games onto each of the drives. and they both worked. Until today where I try installing a new game and I get the exact same message from steam ON BOTH DRIVES. BUT this time Disk Management was giving me no errors! Healthy (Primary Partition) for both drives. So now is this a problem with Steam?

Im so at a loss here. I have my C: on an NVME with my OS. My D: which is a 2TB Seagate drive (which works perfectly fine), my F: which is just an external HDD for movies or w.e, and then my E: and G: as my SSDs.

fq71f2,BigMoney-D,I seriously need some help :/,"Im not very well versed in computers and my english isn't 100% so please bear with me

For the past week I've been trying to figure out why my SSD's are just refusing to work properly.

I was gifted two Samsung Evo 256GB SSD's from my GF's dad who works in IT and has a lot of SSD's laying around. I was planning on making these into my Important Steam games Library for some fast loading and whatnot. My initial plan was to create a Spanned Drive to combine the two drives into one 512GB SSD so It'd be easier to manage my library. I did this through Disk Management.

Everything seems to be working fine for a bit until I try to install a game onto my now one drive. All of a sudden my game stops downloading and Steam gives me a message saying ""An error occured while installing Dark souls II (disk write error):"" and my Spanned drives are now saying something like Healthy(Error) which I don't really know what that means. Since its healthy and giving me errors?

So I do this for a couple days reformatting and re-spanning my drives but the same exact thing keeps happening. Its working perfectly fine, I install a game, I get an error halfway through and then My spanned drives are giving me an error.

So Im thinking that one or both drives are iffy. I completely reinstall my drives and create a new volume but this time I found that you can do a chkdsk and it'll tell you if there are any bad sectors on your drives. But both drives gave me 0 errors and it was all good. So I try installing games onto each of the drives. and they both worked. Until today where I try installing a new game and I get the exact same message from steam ON BOTH DRIVES. BUT this time Disk Management was giving me no errors! Healthy (Primary Partition) for both drives. So now is this a problem with Steam?

Im so at a loss here. I have my C: on an NVME with my OS. My D: which is a 2TB Seagate drive (which works perfectly fine), my F: which is just an external HDD for movies or w.e, and then my E: and G: as my SSDs.

Is it just too many drives? I have an ASUS Strix 270E MB, I7 7700k, 16GB RAM, GTX 1070, and a EVGA 550W Gold+ Power supply. idk if that says anything about my problem. Ive also tried two sets of SATA cables.

I also have G.SKill Trident Z RGB Ram. 

I use the Mystic Light Software for everthing except the Wraith Prism Cooler, for which I use the Cooler Master Software which is dedicated to the cooler.

I thought I could set the cooler to off and just set it the way I want in the cooler Master Software. But after the restart the MSI software has overwritten the cooler master software, and so the cooler was set to off. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah I could just turn the setting off that Mystic Light overwrites other RGB Software, which worked for the cooler.

&amp;#x200B;

But then my RAM thought nothing is set on him and just glowed in default.

Should I just download the RGB software for the RAM and hope that nothing happens?

fq6rk7,Stekun,"Computer seems to have died, not sure what components are dead","Hello all,

This is my second post about this problem. It is my second post because I had already marked the previous post as tech support solved, and I am afraid that nobody will see this if I just switch it to ""tech support"" and post the update. The original post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fktol8/computer_that_did_work_is_no_longer_posting/).

The short of it is this: My friend's computer is my old computer. Recently it started crashing when he got into champion select in League of Legends (the only game he plays). Then it started happening  after just a few minutes after turning the computer on. Eventually the computer wouldn't even boot anymore. The original post has the troubleshooting steps that I took. Eventually, with the help of you fine people here on Reddit, we came to the conclusion that the motherboard had died.

So I told my friend what was up, and told him his options. We decided to upgrade mobo, CPU, and RAM because he was on an fx-8320 and DDR3 RAM, and also that DDR3 mobos with the socket for fx-8320 (I forget what the socket is called) are hard to find, and generally that it would be worth upgrading in his situation.

Here are the components we decided on:

* Mobo: Asrock B450M Pro4-f
* CPU: Ryzen 2600
* RAM: 16 GB T-Force Vulcan Z DDR4, 3200 MHz (2x8GB)

Fast forward about a week to yesterday, and the new components have arrived, and so I replace the CPU, RAM, and mobo, using the same GPU as he had before (an r9 390). Same issue as before, which was no display output at all. I decided to try using an old GPU I had laying around (I think it was a Radeon HD 7000 series or something like that, but it is worth noting that whatever the card, it doesn't have any 8 pin or 6 pin power connectors; it is a card powered from the motherboard) and got a display output. At this point I was thinking it was just the GPU that was dead.

So before I got around to returning the new motherboard, RAM, and CPU I had just bought, I wanted to make sure that it was just the graphics card that died. So I switched out the motherboard, CPU, and RAM again (so now I was back to using his original hardware), and made sure to use the old GPU that I had laying around that just had display output and got no display output again.

So I'm thinking the issue is one of 2 things (or maybe both). The first is faulty power delivery on the motherboard, and the second is a faulty PSU. I don't want to believe the second one because that would mean that we would have to buy EVEN MORE parts (basically to the point of building a new PC), but I want more opinions before I say for sure. But I also don't think that its the PSU because the PSU is much newer than the motherboard (probably like 2 or 3 years old vs like 6 or 7 years old), and is also from EVGA, which my understanding is that they make really reliable PSUs.

But anyways, what are your thoughts on what the issues could be?",10,1585346144,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq6rk7/computer_seems_to_have_died_not_sure_what/,pcmasterrace,1

I then found out that the ASUS ROG BIOS has the Turbo Setting as a default, and that some of the default settings are actually meant to overclock. The thing is i don't care/know about overclocking, and i can't find any of the normal/stock settings online. The Core Ratio Limit is set at 42, for example i believe, i don't know if that's too much or normal. I don't mind sacrificing performance in the name of not crashing/burning the CPU. The GPU is not overheating btw.

So, is 55¬∞-65¬∞C a normal temperature for, let's say, just running Google and Spotify? I want the CPU to last. Running at 3.5Ghz frequency and 0.9 core voltage.

This lead me to research as much as I could, watching every video I could.  Ideally I wanted to install the Accelero III as this card will inevitably find home in an NCase M1 once the 3xxx series releases.

I bought both the Accelero and a Morpheus II just in case.  I was regularly warned how bad the Accelero install was but I didn't listen.  Here's the Accelero from last night.

[https://i.imgur.com/XNMqzUu.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XNMqzUu.jpg)

You can see a third party backplate I bought on eBay to use with it.  It came recommended from another Accelero user.  Mainly just didn't want the exposed PCB look.  In the end, try as I might, I couldn't get good temps.  I posted about it here last night.  This morning temps were worse than yesterday.

Today I decided to skip to the Morpheus.  Tried first with the backplate and that didn't work at all.  Temps were skyrocketing above 90C at idle.  Took off the backplate, was super easy to install without it, and immediately am seeing what the fuss is about.

Temps in Fire Strike top out and average 62C.

I'm thinking about building a new PC for gaming.  Flight Simulator 2020 and using my Oculus Quest with the link cable for PCVR gaming are calling my name.  I have an overclocked i7-920 machine that I built years ago collecting dust in a closet.

Is [tomshardware.com](https://tomshardware.com) still a good place to start?  I know I'm about to go down a rabbit hole of research (I can't buy anything without overthinking it) and I just want to make the process as efficient as possible.

Any thoughts on what I might be able to cannibalize from that i7-920 rig?  I'm thinking the case, power supply (Corsair HX850W) and the fans are probably it, but I may want a new case anyway.

fq4zjc,TheFilthyPixels,Modern CPUs Are Overkill And Overrated?,"TL;DR: My 2012 i7 runs even the most demanding games at 1080p at 60fps alongside a GTX 1080. So why do we recommend such brand new CPUs to newcomers?  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Back in around 2014 I built my first gaming PC for MGS5. I had a GTX 970 and an i5 3340. I bought a 2nd 970 but the CPU became a bottleneck.  
  
So, I upgraded to the best CPU my 2012 motherboard could support, an i7 3770k. I realized while playing Red Dead 2 (I now have a GTX 1080) that my motherboard (and that CPU I think) is from 2012!  
  
It, in my opinion, shows gow little CPUs are used in games, and thanks to my SSD, 12gb RAM, everything else I use, video editting and making music run perfectly smoothly with almost no load time. So what would the incentive be for upgrading my CPU?  
  
I get it for people who work in CPU intensive fields or enjoy 3D rendering as a job or hobby but why are sich fast, modern CPUs used and recommended so often when it seems a near decade old CPU is working jusy fine with a powerful GPU?  
  
I remember hearing people call modern CPU hype ""overrated"". I think they're right. Am I wrong? If so, why?  
  
Another reason I think this is that I've been checking out pre-owned laptops. Their CPUs, laptop CPUs from 2010 through 2014 are more than perfect for the majority of people's daily use, web browsing, homework, research, light gaming etc. I've decided myself to get 2 pre owned laptops rather than 1 new one for this reason because I'll be soing everything on but gaming. As lo g as they have an SSD their CPUs seem to be more than enough for a Windows 10 system and, even better, a modern Linux install.  
  
What are your opinions? I've been waiting for my CPU to show it's age next to my 1080 but have been lucky so far. Maybe if I start playing 4k games I'll notice a big difference? Although, Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal both run at solid 60fps in 4k on it.  
  
Should we be recommending people buy older CPUs to save money? It just seems crazy to me that my CPU is nearly 10 years old and ran RDR2 perfectly at 60fps at 1080p and people are recommending people buy top of the range CPUs. Again, if theyre rendering video and audio (I noticed a HUGE render speed difference for music after upgrading to i7) then great, but most of the time they're dping dat to day tasks while enjoying modern games. In that case the biggest bottleneck is having a mech HDD. So an SSD will cure that.",15,1585340901,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq4zjc/modern_cpus_are_overkill_and_overrated/,pcmasterrace,1
fq4ynh,Walrus_warlord,Games Crash at Startup," I have had my computer fro almost 6 years with no major issues I haven't been able to fix on my own. This morning I opened up my computer as normal and tried to open rocket league and the game opened to its first loading screen with the Psyonix logo then crashed. I tried this with a few other games including Doom 2016, Total War Warhammer, Battlefield 5 and Overwatch. All of these games crashed upon trying to open. Some of them would only open to a black screen and I would have to close manually with the task manager. Some of the games will try to send a blank crash report but will not do it every time they crash. I also got this error when trying to open rocket league 1 time ""the exception unknown software exception (0xe0000008) occurred in the application at location 0x00007ffa6cc7a859""  


The only game on my computer that is working is Sid Meier's CIV 5 which runs completely fine. Also after trying to start a few different games the desktop stops showing what icons are highlighted when clicking on them and this only goes away when the computer is restarted.  


I tried uninstalling and reinstalling rocket league to see if that would help and it did not change anything. I have updated my drivers with the GeForce experience as well as updated Windows 10. I also ran a Windows Memory Diagnostic which found nothing. The only thing I did when shutting off my computer last night was uninstall Samsung Magician which I wrongly thought was a bug as it was giving me popups I had never seen. I reinstalled this this morning after these issues began. I have also been using Core Temp to check the temperatures while trying to start the games but I have not seen any changes from regular temps.  


My specs are:  
CPU: Intel Core i5-6600K  
MOBO : Gigabyte Z170N-Gaming 5  
RAM : 16 GB (2x8GB) G. Skill Ripjaws V series DDR4-2400  
SSD : Samsung 850 EVO 500 GB  
GPU : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070  
PSU: EVGA 700 BR  


The only thing I have replaced since building it 6 years ago is the PSU which I replaced about 1 year ago. I have no idea why this is happening. Thanks for your help.",0,1585340827,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq4ynh/games_crash_at_startup/,pcmasterrace,1

fq4cjr,SaidAFunnyThingOnce,Problem Starting a Recently Built PC,"Hi all,

I finished building a new PC about a month ago. It‚Äôs been working flawlessly and performing well until today. I‚Äôve mostly just been playing Overwatch on it and tend to leave it on overnight every other night or so.

I accidentally left my computer on last night and when I woke up this morning it was off.

When I went to go turn it on, all of my LEDs flashed on and then immediately turned off, almost as though the computer is protecting itself from a surge. I‚Äôve posted a picture of the computer while it‚Äôs off as well as a video of me trying to turn it on. I‚Äôll now list my specs and observations about the computer in its current state.

Specs:

CPU:

Intel Core i5-9600K 3.7 GHz 6-Core Processor

CPU Cooler:

Corsair H100i PRO 75 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler

Motherboard:

RAM:

G.Skill Trident Z RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR4-3000 Memory

SSD:

Samsung 970 Evo Plus 250 GB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive

GPU:

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8 GB Video Card

Power Supply:

Observations:

\- I didn‚Äôt unplug anything or change anything around‚Äîliterally nothing has changed between now and last night as far as I know

\- I think I left it on all night and when I woke up it was off

\- I don‚Äôt see or smell any blown capacitors

\- When I attempt to turn it on, the CPU, case, and heat sync flash on and immediately turn off. Also, the fans run for a split second and then turn off

\- I double checked all of the interior connections and they‚Äôre all tight from what I can tell

\- There are no loose cables on the power supply

\- While the computer is off, the ram is fully lighting up, the graphics card indicator lights are on, and case indicator lights are on

\- I suspect the issue might be with the memory, motherboard, or power supply

The problem though is, that my motherboard has more ports than the previous one, and doesn't fit in the old shielding, but I don't want to buy a new case. 
So I just spend another 2 hours trying to figure out what to do when a friend advised me to ask in this reddit.

fq3smi,iamjeli,What size desk should I get for pc gaming?,"So I built my pc about 2 months ago. I bought a simple Linnmon desk with Adils legs from Ikea which set me back a tiny ¬£15. 

The table is 1.2m (or 1m) long by 60cm deep. However, I intend to get a second monitor and I‚Äôve had to move my pc down onto the floor because the desk isn‚Äôt deep enough to have my monitor, pc and enough space for my mouse to live freely. 

I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm getting cable drag ever since I put my pc on the floor and it‚Äôs really affecting me when I play games, especially since I mainly play Siege. I think that because the table isn‚Äôt deep enough, most of my mouse cable hangs off of the back of my desk where my pc is so when I‚Äôm trying to control recoil I end up pulling the cable upwards, which is causing that dragging sensation.

I‚Äôd just like recommendations on a fairly inexpensive table/desk (I‚Äôd say up to ¬£100) that can hold 2 monitors and my pc as well as have enough space for my mouse to move comfortably. Ideally, I‚Äôd be looking for a desk that is between 1.5m to 2m. I wouldn‚Äôt mind another Ikea desk as long as it‚Äôs stable. I‚Äôve noticed that the desk I have rn is extremely shaky and even leaning on it then getting off of it causes it to shake and squeak.

**Chipset Drivers:** 10.0.18362.387

**Background Applications:** Steam, Chrome, GOG, Rockstar Games Launcher

**Description of Original Problem:** I've had my computer for about a year and have always gamed on an AOC CQ27G1 27' @ 1440 144Hz without issue. Most games at ultra settings. Yesterday, I added a second monitor to my computer and ever since then, I've started getting VERY bad screen flickering in random games. The screen flickering doesn't appear to be a VSync type of flickering. It looks as if someone started violently wiggling my DisplayPort cable. My audio runs from the monitor as well, and the audio cuts in synchronization with the display flickering. Will update with a video of the flickering.

**Troubleshooting:**

* Swapped cables from DisplayPort to HDMI and back. Unplugged secondary monitor. No discernible difference.
* Ran ATS in OpenGL, Safe Mode, and Direct X. OpenGL provided best results. Still screen flickering, but less frequent. Not playable.
* Ran games in windowed/full screen. Ran games with full screen optimizations disabled. Disabled/enabled VSync. No discernible difference.
* Downloaded Windows Media Creation tool. Formatted HDD and SSD. Reinstalled windows fresh.
* Uninstalled GPU Drivers. Reinstalled.
* Installed monitor drivers after factory resetting monitor.
* Power cycled machine.

**Notes:**

* Screen doesn't flicker when doing anything outside of video games
* There was no flicker prior to the addition of a second monitor. Each of the games listed could run at or near max settings without issue.
* Audio, which is connected to the impacted monitor, cuts out in synchronization with screen flickering.
* I've had this computer and most of these games for a while now. This issue has never occured prior to the addition of the second monitor. Removing the second monitor does not seem to fix the issue, though.
* When launching games through Radeon Adrenalin, Radeon Adrenalin does not recognize any performance issues.
* Nothing seems wrong in Task Manager when the games are open.
* No integrated graphics

I don't overclock and dont remember changing stuff in BIOS. I even reduced my power usage in power options from 100% to 90% and it just happened again. Also my cpu is only running at 38 degrees also.

I saw some things about bluescreenviewer but I do not really understand things like that. I downloaded and this is what shows up: [https://imgur.com/a/eCdcztm](https://imgur.com/a/eCdcztm)

I hope someone could help me.",16,1585334485,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq2sp5/whea_uncorrectable_error_makes_my_computer_crash/,pcmasterrace,1

fq2p5h,Ancient_stuntman,660ti dead? - Potential TIFU.,"So today i was looking at possible upgrades for my pc and decided to crack that puppy open. 

long story short, i removed my graphics card and RAM and popped them back in after figuring out what they are, (i know i can do this from the pc) turned it back on, at this point it powered on for **1 second** and turned off. i was met with a slight **burning smell!** :( it then wouldn't turn on. 

at this point i inspected the pc for any damage, but no obvious damage or burning was present. powered it back on and it worked, although now i am not getting any output to my monitor. 

i have attempted removing the GPU and going off the motherboard but no luck there either. still no HDMI out. 

it does now turn on and the graphics cards fans are spinning but i feel as though it could be the graphics card that has perished? it has been glitchy as of late, and i had been getting a warning/crash message from Divinity original sin 2 related to old hardware (hence perusing for upgrades) 

sorry for the paragraph, a late friend gave me this PC and i am desperate to get it back up and running so any help would be greatly appreciated. (especially during isolation times) 

&amp;#x200B;

Many thanks",9,1585334224,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq2p5h/660ti_dead_potential_tifu/,pcmasterrace,1
fq2lt2,sarthak366,Graphical glitches please HELP," 

recently graphical glitches started appearing while gaming on my 1050ti dell laptop.Looked around and found it was gpu related so,

1. I did everything that i could do drivers related,updated to latest,installed OEM provided on their website,used ddu but nothing seems to work

2.Ran a couple of stress test like FURMARK,UNIGINE,3DMark but every thing works like charm even benchmarking result from 3DMaark are perfectly fine.

3.Temps are normal for laptop(i think) 71 on cpu and 67 on gpu

some people are saying vram or voltage regultors maye be faulty but i don't know how to test them or maye be they are overheating again i donot know how to check theirs temp or whole motherboard's temp.

one person said he had similar issue but psu was the problem in his case but i am on laptop so i don't know maybe adapter issue or gpu not getting enough power.

i was planing to play some games while in quarantine but i am just sad now :(

this sucks....",2,1585333950,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq2lt2/graphical_glitches_please_help/,pcmasterrace,1

fq2l79,Codswallop_30,"""Future Proof"" Build Help","I know there's really no such thing as ""future proof"", but at the same time, I am not planning on replacing parts every 2 years. Would this build be good for me for the next 5+ years or so without having to to major upgrades? I've also made a second list but of course, its more expensive. I'm planning on using it for gaming on 1440p 144hz and also some engineering computation work that I may have to bring home.

With duct tape they still work, but now are less comfortable and sometime make scratching noises. I'm looking for a new headset thats hopefully just as good or better than the g430s that is slightly more sturdy. One thing that has spoiled me however, is the ability to hear my voice through my headset. I have used friends' headsets and now will not use a headset that does not have the voice playback that my g430s have. If any of you guys have recommendations, that would be much appreciated.

Looking at the list of stuff on parts picker, I don‚Äôt know anything at all about CPU coolers, motherboards, video cards, cases, power supply, optical drives, operating system options (all I know is I want windows 10, but there‚Äôs lots of different windows 10 options), software (my MSI laptop has some Killer internet, and GeForce thing that lets me record gameplay and access games from it which I would like on the desktop too), don‚Äôt know anything about monitors but want a pretty nice one (don‚Äôt really care about 4K, care more about refresh rate)

I also know nothing about the accessories tab (case accessories, case fans, fan controllers, thermal compound, UPS systems), or the expansion cards/networking tab (sound cards, wired network adapters, wireless network adapters). I‚Äôm also clueless about which speakers are good. My cyberpower Desktop used a tv as the screen so I haven‚Äôt ever had to worry about buying speakers. 

Money isn‚Äôt too important either, I‚Äôve got an overall budget of probably $1500-2500. Maybe $3000 as an absolute maximum if all the parts are just amazing (that‚Äôs including monitors and other accessories)

I know SSD is probably superior in all ways and I should have just gotten a bigger one from the start. I know the game/program loading from the HDD will be slower, but aside from that will there be any noticeable difference in-game once the game is loaded?

Gtx 1080 Ti Inno3D Ultra Chillx3 (no custom OC)

fq0fzi,Icybubba,Let's talk about our journey to becoming a PC gamer and our first experiences playing on PC,"So my earliest experiences with playing video games was from the good ol' Super Nintendo, I played games like Mario World, Yoshi's Island, the Super Star Wars games, Zombies Ate My Neighbors, Mario Kart.

This was a blast and I was too young at the time to really care deeply about performance and that sort of thing, I was at the age where I was old enough to comprehend what I was doing but young enough to be content, because at the time the Super Nintendo was a fairly old system, the GameCube was out at this time for example.

During Christmas 2007 my parents bought me and my sister a Nintendo Wii, it was such an amazing feeling seeing the Wii's package come out as a surprise extra gift for us, and some of my fondest memories of gaming took place on the Wii, playing games like Wii Sports with my family as we got super competitive over bowling and gulf.

Around this time I began day dreaming over owning a Nintendo DS, all my friends had them so I would stare and watch them play the DS wishing that I could own one as well. The thing is I wasn't staying up to date on this whole 3DS idea coming out, all I knew is I wanted a DS, I would constantly throw sly hints to my parents about getting one. Then came Christmas 2010 and my Aunt send my sister and I two gifts, the sheer joy I felt when I opened that package and saw the box that said ""Nintendo 3DS"", I actually flipped I couldn't contain my excitement, not only was it a DS, it was a 3DS, a 3. D. S.

It was red and glossy and my sister got one too, our first two games we had on those systems was Lego Star Wars III and Super Mario 3D Land.

I also got to play a bit on the Original Xbox, one of my other aunts owned an Xbox so whenever we got to visit her house I would get to experience the thrill of playing on Xbox. My favorite game ever released on any Xbox bar none is Burnout 3, that game when I played it with my aunt was amazing. So much fun.

While I was clearly focused on consoles at this point I was also beginning to lay down foundations to what would become my love for PC gaming.

My mom bought a few ""Computer games"" at this point as well, or actually this would've been before 2010, probably like 2005 and up in that range. It was a lot of silly games meant to keep my sister and I entertained, stuff like 101 Dalmatians , A bible game where you have to find an inn for Mary and Joseph, It's The Big Game, Charlie Brown. Etc. These were some of my first PC games.

My first heavy PC game I played though, was Halo Combat Evolved. I can remember the set up in our living room we had two desktop computers, one was an HP Windows XP, I think it was like a Pavilion or something. Then the other was like a prebuilt Dell that my dad upgraded so it could like.....work. The Dell was for me and my sister and the HP was for my parents. Both had Windows XP on them and had good ol CRT monitors. I mainly used mine to use the internet YouTube and the like, and to play Club Penguin. But my dad and I would duke it out on CTF on Halo because we had two copies of the game.

Another PC game I was exposed to around this time, though I wasn't old enough yet to understand the mechanics, was Knights of the Old Republic. I would watch my parents play that game and be so impressed with it.

I was also introduced to the world of MMO's as well, with my favorite MMO to this day, City of Heroes. And I still play this game to this day through private servers.

In 2012 I was heavily playing Club Penguin and City of Heroes, this year brought with it a lot, my grandfather died this year, City of Heroes shut down I wouldn't be able to play again for years. But the ball for my PC gaming journey really started to roll.

You see there's a very good reason I would bring up a game like Club Penguin in this discussion. Early in the year or late 2011 in that ballpark I was looking up Club Penguin walkthroughs, and stumbled across a website called Club Penguin Insiders, this website was attached to a YouTube channel called Insiders Network, ran by a guy who went by the username ""Thinknoodles"", now I mainly watched this channel for the Club Penguin content, however in late 2012 to early 2013 I noticed this channel was starting to get heavily populated by content of a game I hadn't heard of yet, Minecraft.

Eventually I dived in to this series titled ""Minecraft: Survival"" from him because I was intrigued as to why he was featuring this game so prominently, I had my mind blown away by this game, this game where you could seemingly do anything, I continued to watch this series being amazed by the ravines he found himself in, all on this journey to slay a dragon, I felt such a strong desire to play this game so I told my dad about it, we both played the demo of the game, I played it over and over trying to do as much as I could in the limited time they gave you to play, learning how to chop down trees and tame wolves.

Ultimately my dad found a work around in the launcher where you could play 1.5.2 for free offline, so I played that for months until I eventually had the money in October 2013 to buy the game myself. And I was once again blown away by the game because now I could play online on the servers, and I could play the most recent versions, now there were horses and a sprint key, and new biomes.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2015 we sold our Wii and bought an Xbox One, you see while I was definitely starting to have my eyes opened to the world of PC, I still just had a laptop, so basically after our Windows XP desktops we all got laptops, I had a hand me down Windows Vista(Yeah, it was kind of crap) Compaq laptop, that eventually got replaced by a Toshiba Windows 7 laptop that in 2015 was replaced by a Toshiba Windows 8 laptop that I still have and I upgraded to Windows 10. But we ended up getting an Xbox One. I was finding myself getting disappointed by the new console, the games that I wanted to play had online and you had to pay for online which is something I was used to not having to do with Nintendo and PC.

After being let down by the Xbox One, in 2016 I made the decision, I was going to build a PC, I wanted PC gaming to be my platform of choice, it was just a matter of how am I going to do this? See I knew about building PC's but I had been convinced that it was too complicated, but I was also having people in my other ear tell me that I could do it, my uncle's built PC's. 

I went on YouTube to do research about this subject, for a few months I put the idea on backburner, but then after playing through Portal 2 on my laptop, and attempting to play Overwatch on my laptop as well and after continuing to be disappointed with the Xbox, I committed to the idea, I found PCPartPicker and I watched YouTube videos, learned about benchmarks, the works. So I began to slowly accumulate parts for my PC, unfortunately, since I didn't have a stable source of income at the time, the process was slow going, but in 2019 I bought my last part.

My PC was a Ryzen 5 1500X, Radeon RX 580 8GB, 16 GB DDR4-3000 RAM, B350 Tomahawk mobo, 500 GB SSD, 1TB HDD, 450W PSU non modular. My monitor was a $5 DVI-D monitor I got from a thrift shop so I could have something, it was 900p 60hz for $5 it was a steal tbh. I had a cheap little keyboard, and a wireless mouse you could buy at Walmart.

The true definition of it ain't much but it's mine lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time I've been able to upgrade the PC especially now that I do have a stable source of income.

My keyboard now has RGB lol, my cheapo mouse was replaced by a Logitech G600, RX 580 was replaced by a 5700 XT, 1500X replaced by a 3600, added a 2TB HDD, that 450w non modular? Replaced with a 600W semi modular. That cheapo $5 monitor? Replaced a 1080p 144hz Freesync monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't see me going back to console except maybe to play Nintendo as a secondary, the PC world has just blown me away.

So I built my 1st PC last year and have slowly improved on it. If you have any suggestions or tips to help me take it up a level please do let me know. My 1 major issue with it currently is that since I have installed the GPU vertically it is not perfectly straight and slopes down slightly. That really triggers my OCD and I would like to find a way to get it to be perfectly straight. Besides that I do plan on getting two more sticks of ram and maybe fans for the bottom.

Look forward to your opinions on it even if you just drop by  to give it a rating or criticize it.

Thank You.

fq0d9d,I_am_Searching,Recommendations on monitors,"It's been 5 years since I have bought a monitor and man, the market sure has changed!

Right now I am running a Ryzen build with a 1080, and I use my PC for work and gaming.

My current setup is a dual monitor arm with a 27"" and 22"" monitor @ 1080p.

I have found 27"" is too big for games, and 22"" is to small.  So if I went dual monitor, I would probably get a 24-25""

I really want a 4k monitor, but I don't want to break the bank.  I watch most of my movies on my 4k tv, so it's more for gaming.  I do play some FPS games, but I don't compete, so I can sacrifice on refresh for better quality for my RPGs and story based games.


I could be moved to get an ultrawide, or just another 24"" 16:9.

fq0565,Shaun979,Website for PC performance estimates across generations,"I have an 8 year old PC that was pretty high spec for its time.  Back then I spent around 3K on it.  It is still running well for all my day to day tasks except is slow when I render videos but I do this only 3 times a year.   Some of my fans are also dying.  


Recently out of curiosity I asked a PC shop what it would cost to build another high spec PC in 2019 and they said over 4K because the price of components had increased due to high demand from crypto miners.  They claimed there was no way to match or exceed the performance of my old PC, unless I spent 4K or more.  


 I then asked about transferring all my old components over to a new case, maybe upgrading the CPU, do full clean up, replace all the fans at the same time.  The reply was that it wouldn't work because the new systems are all designed for low power consumption compared to the earlier generation, and the hardware would all be incompatible.  The recommendation was that I should just buy a whole new PC, or continue using my old one as it is.    


Is there a website where I can choose my old PC specs from drop down menus, and then get a single normalized overall performance number to compare it on the same scale to modern PCs that I also spec on the site, and see how much I really have to spend in order to get X, Y, or Z level of performance?  I don't have a good understanding of speed, cores, threads, CPU or GPU or RAM matching, and the differences across generations in order to estimate overall performance myself.  Hope there's a website that can help me with this.",3,1585326801,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq0565/website_for_pc_performance_estimates_across/,pcmasterrace,1

fq01m1,HappyHappyGamer,Prodigal son (and also suggestions about gaming laptop),"So...bit older gamer here, I have not build a PC gaming rig since 9800 card era haha.

Life got hectic, got older and been only playing console games when I have time (mostly switch honestly).

Since I am home alot, suddenly wanted to get back into PC gaming!

I decided to go with a gaming laptop. Ok, ok I know, it is a waste of money vs. building an amazing desktop rig + great monitor, but my lifestyle currently really gets me staying outside of the home (although, this seems unlikely as of now hahaha).

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to ask some of you guys about getting a laptop with a budget around 1700 USD. I was really debating between:

Asus ROG 2070 max-q, Asus rog rtx 2060 (replace these two with MSIs), and I even looked into 1660 Tis.

I am mostly trying to play VR half life, but also many other games I love on PC as well. Def consider myself a bit hardcore gamer in terms of the genres I love (not time I play).

Also, how many of you have the eGPU setup? Some even recommended picking up a 1660Ti cheaper, and using a eGPU for home when I wanted to really crank up the graphics. That sounds expensive though.

I know gaming laptops are not the popular way to go (believe me, i would rather a desktop), but looking into the future, I still need to travel quite frequently within and overseas.

eventually though I want to build a desktop, and hope I can return here for some suggestions again!",0,1585326509,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fq01m1/prodigal_son_and_also_suggestions_about_gaming/,pcmasterrace,1

About a week and a half ago I ordered a Pre Built PC (pls no hate I know pre builts tend to be disliked) that I personally customized from iBuyPower. I've never had a PC desktop before, so when picking the parts, I did several weeks of research on the parts and also consulted my friend who has built PC's before. I still have a few questions before it arrives at my house on Monday. 

1. When I first take my PC out of the box, what should I look for inside the PC? I've seen videos of pre-built Gaming PC's and in some of them, cables are in the wrong place or detached, and was just wondering if there should be anything else I should look for.
2. When I first boot up the PC, is there anything else I should check for? (Audio drivers, etc.)
3. How do I keep track of what drivers I need/keeping them updated?  I currently have a Dell laptop and get really confused when it comes to keeping track of drivers. 
4. Is there any software I can download to control things like fan speeds or graphics card settings? Also, any recommendations for benchmarking software to make sure my PC is performing well?
5. What can I do to take care of my new PC to ensure it has a decently long life span?

fpzm7h,sharkseries,Pc gone black screen while gaming and GPU fan spinning at max speed,"Hi guys,

My pc crashed just now when I was playing the least expected game to crash which was Dota 2. My GPU temp was below 65 degrees, while all of sudden my pc crashed and the GPU fan spinned like crazy.

 I restarted my pc and tried to connect to the game again , and the same thing happened like 1 min later. I don't know if something triggered it like casting a spell but it took pretty much the same time to crash again for like 3-4 times.

I was looking somewhere and heard that it might be due to loose 16 pin connector which I did open my pc up 2 days ago, and thought maybe I've loosened it. I was thinking about either loose connector or GPU thermal paste needed changing.

So I took out my GPU just to give it a little wipe down and reconnected it. My pc doesn't seem to crash anymore after trying to spam tons of skills in the game. I also did heaven benchmark test twice and seemed to be fine.

Is this something that would happen? I've been using this pc for 7 months and never experienced this before.

fpzga4,Mezgraf,2060 Super vs RX 5700 XT,"As the title suggests, I am torn between getting the 2060 Super or the RX 5700 XT. I realize that in terms of raw power the 5700 xt outperforms the 2060 Super, and I know the capabilities of ray tracing on 2060 Super are not as good compared to higher NVIDIA models, however the 2060 Super has a dedicated hardware encoder that would be better for streaming.

For context, this is my first every PC build and I plan to stream, game, produce music and video edit. I live in Ontario, Canada and my price range is roughly $1400 CAD and I do not want to go much over, which is why I'm not going for the 2070 Super and calling it a day lol. In the near future I would love to stream music production as well as games such as Cyberpunk 2077, modded Skyrim, Minecraft, League of Legends, the Withcer 3, and other indie games such as Stardew Valley. Currently, I plan on getting this setup, with the graphics card subject to change. Any thoughts/opinions/recommendations  on which graphics card would better suit me would be greatly appreciated!

fpyoic,Skandi007,"My PC keeps crashing during gaming, this is getting seriously annoying.","Something odd that has recently started occurring, is that my entire pc freezes and crashes (with audio looping) when playing games. I don't get BSOD, I can't access CTRL+ALT+DEL, I just need to manually press the power button and restart.

Now, my system is quite new, and beefy. I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600 (watercooled, temps never go above 50), RTX 2070 Super (temps never go above ~65), 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and the system is running off an NVMe M.2 SSD. Clearly, lack of performance, or heat problems, shouldn't be the cause.

At first this issue started occurring with Borderlands 3. Alright, I thought, maybe the game really is that demanding and unoptimized, that my PC simply cannot handle it. Then it happened once during a Divinity: OS2 session. Okay, that's odd. Finally it occurred once when playing Siege, and today when I tried playing PUBG. (Couldn't even get one match done). It doesn't happen during regular PC usage, or, weirdly enough, when I play For Honor. Only on other games, the number of which is rapidly growing.

I have tried every trick in the book, looked across forums and reddit threads, and found no working solution. I have completely cleaned my PC and all of its fans to check for potential cooling issues, reinstalled my Corsair Hydro H80i V2. Ran MemTest86 for hours without any issues, installed new drivers for virtually everything, even my BIOS.

Issue still occurs. Please help me find a solution. I'm currently sitting at home in quarantine and I'm probably going to die of boredom without video games.

also, this is more important, i need to know if using a test bench instead of a usual case would be better, because testing bench seems way more convenient when you need to swap parts and the gpu wont sag. The problem with test bench i read from other post is that there are static field within the assembly so by not having a protective case, it will cause electric shock and potentially damage your parts.",4,1585321371,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fpyeul/pc_case_vs_testing_bench_need_pro_advice_thank_you/,pcmasterrace,1

fpy7zz,Galactic_Druid,Oculus Quest Vs. Rift s; is it worth buying another headset?,"I've been using an Oculus Quest for a while now, and I do love the the thing, usually in small doses because it does get heavy on my face after a while.

With Alyx out, I've been using VR a LOT more, and am thinking about grabbing a few other bigger games as well; like Stormlands and Asgard's Wrath. The only down side is the headset still gets uncomfortable after an hour or so, and as I understand it, the rift s is a better quality display.

For those of you who have had the chance to use both; is the difference (both in comfort and image quality) enough to justify buying a rift s when I already own a quest, or would I just be wasting money on a barely noticeable upgrade?

fpxc8n,bootz-n-catz,"[Build request] My 5yr old daughter's first PC, for gaming in the living room","Hi PCMR :) 

I want to get my little girl, Matilda, a PC for her 5th birthday.  Normally I would spend a few days / weeks idly looking up parts, watching comparison vids, keeping an eye on price history, before buying a few parts and putting it together - but her birthday is at the start of April, so I haven't got much time!  Hence, I turn to PCMR...

Criteria:

I am in the UK.
Quiet (it will be in the living room, connected to TV).
Discreet (no RGB - I'm a grown man - must look OK next to TV).
Must play Sims with all expansions with good performance.
I don't need Windows - I've got a spare 10 Pro licence (transferable, not OEM).
No monitor required, as it will be plugged into LG TV.
Budget:  As cheap as possible.  I'm hoping ~¬£500, but I have no idea how realistic that is.

As I say, she is only just 5, so this does not have to be fancy - my main aim is for it to be quiet as it will be in the living room, so won't be a hulking RGB monstrosity either.

A monitor isn't required, but recommendations for a decent keyboard &amp; mouse solution for little hands gaming from the sofa would be appreciated - although I intend for her to primarily use an Xbox controller, it would be nice for her to pick up all the PC basics as well :)

So i thought for now i would install lower graphic card but in future i would only buy better graphic card and would be good to go with new games i guess? Am i thinking right? And could someone give insights about the build, here's the build. Thanks:

fpx3gn,Bird_Who_Cant_Fly,"Hey PCMR, I need some help...","So I posted here a couple months ago when I came home from school and my pc wouldn‚Äôt boot. It had no issues prior to this so I was understandably shocked. My specs are as follows.

CPU:Ryzen 3 2200g
GPU  #2 (the one that wont boot) RX 570 expedition
GPU #1: Gt1030
Motherboard: MSI B350 pcmate
Ram: 2x 4gb of patriot 2400mz

I had upgraded to the RX570 from the gt1030 about 2 months prior to this and it was working fine. I spent about 4 hours troubleshooting and trying to eliminate the issue. And I finally figured out that my pc just didn‚Äôt want to boot when I had a graphics card in. So logically I tried to put on my gt103(which I luckily hadn‚Äôt sold yet) and it worked like nothing had ever happened. At that point I was just flat out tired so I left it for another day.

That brings me to today, I am looking to upgrade my gt1030 as I can run only a select few of the games I want to play. And I am trying to figure out what happened to my rx570. When I try to boot my pc, the lights on my motherboard light up for just a split second before turning off.

fpwrhu,ZeroBANG,"I get a black screen from the GPU, tried everything, ALL the hardware is tested and works fine... just not together.","I've been at it for hours now and am out of ideas, 
i build a PC for my Dad... last week it was all working fine, i installed a few more parts that got delivered this week (mostly fans and extension cables), now all i get is a black screen from the GPU, the onboard intel HD graphics works fine.  
It just acts like the GPU just was not even plugged in.  
The Monitor says Analog Power Saving mode and turns off the moment i plug it into the GT710.  

It doesn't show any error at all, the LEDs on the Motherboard don't show an error, no exclamation mark in Windows device manager (the GT710 just doesn't show up at all, not in AIDA64 either and installing Nvidia drivers doesn't see a GPU either and stops the install [not that windows drivers would help]).  

I put the GPU in my unRAID server, plugged the same monitor in, same cable, and it works just fine. So the GPU and screen and cable are tested and working fine...  

- I reseated the GPU multiple times, 
- i tried the 2nd PCIE slot as well, 
- i've set the BIOS to use PCIE as primary grahpics output, 
- i did a CMOS clear  
- i pulled the new extension cables out again (they are the only new thing that might possibly impact power delivery)  

...nothing helped.  

I plugged an oooooooooold PCI card (Viper V330 from 1994 with 4MB Vram ... yes MB!) in to see if that works and it did... so the PCI slots are working. Doesn't help me with the PCIe slots of course.  

The only other idea i have is to pull the GTX260 out of that old potato PC over there and try that one, that would be the only other PCIE device i have that i could test the slot with, but i don't see a reason why this one should work when the GT710 already doesn't.  

I also noticed the GT710 gets warm when i let it just run a bit, so i know it is at least getting power.

fpwr6c,Nixellion,Looking for new chair,"Hi!

I'm looking for some chair recommendations, as my current one is getting close to 10 years old. It's a good chair, but with some materials on it literally starting to fall apart and me getting some extra money I think it's time to replace it with something new.

I'm not looking for GAMING chair specifically, as far as I know most gaming chairs have non-gaming equivalents which are usually cheaper or even better. That said, however, I can justify spending some extra since I spend like most of my time in it, since I work from home. So I'd say a budget range of 100$-400$.

My current chair is some old Dauphin model, mesh back, don't remember the name and it's long gone from their website.

I definitely want it to have a headrest

after this didn't work I set up a static IP address which is read in some other forum post, but that didn't work for me either. I also went into my computer firewall and allowed port 25565 for TCU/UDP.  


I have tried testing this by getting a friend to try and connect to the server and also using a port checker but still no luck.

About a year ago she bought a new Acer Nitro 5 gaming laptop but it doesn't seem to perform as well as its specs would suggest. 

It's got:
Intel Core i5-8300H
4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX  1050
8GB RAM DDR4

The problem we're having is that it doesn't seem to be able to play games very well. One of the main ones we've had trouble with is Skyrim LE. My laptop that's 2 years older and lower spec runs it just fine. 

We've tried turning all graphics settings right down but beyond that we don't know what to do.

fpuki1,ahkehloh123,HDD to SSD clone fail please help,"So I screwed up both my HDD and SSD drives. The PC I have is the Alienware aurora R8(I know I should have built one I learned my lesson the hard way). It came with a 1tb HDD drive and I figured I'd upgrade to an SSD and use the old drive for storage. I bought a 500gb SSD to clone Windows 10, and also run Modern warefare. I then went on Youtube and followed the instrictions to  this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H7D1HcfY9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H7D1HcfY9o) 

In short if you don't care to watch the video: 

* Downloaded Macrium Reflect
* Shrunk partions in order to fit other partions in new SSD cloning selection space

after I did this, My cloning proccess was stopped due to not being able to access a certain file? not to sure what the exact pop up said, but I believe it was a security program from alienware? or Dell? 

I then cancelled the proccess believing no changes would be made, but I was wrong. My SSD had one partiton cloned. After this happened, I was unable to open my SSD  in file manager. And was met with the message ""You don't currently have permission to access this file"". I'm confused as to why I'm locked out of my SSD, and why it's now red and under the name ""ESP (A:). I've also tried to format the SSD but had no success. I Can't even access the option. 

on top of that my 1tb HDD now only shows a maximum of 486GB. 

I have no idea what to do, and most likely make no sense. I don't understand this at all, I'm new to the PC world. If anyone could share some advice that would be great.....I've also tried to reset my PC but was denied the ability to do so??????????  

Could I reverse these changes?? delete the partion on my SSD? Restore storage capacity? Actually move files from hdd to ssd?

I realize I would be a low tier god with these specs but:

Half Life Alyx is probably the final push I needed to wanting to buy a PC. By far not the only reason though.

I'd obviously need to buy a headset as well and don't want to spend literal thousands on a PC. But I was checking out specs I need for some games and I think this is a decent machine.

AMD Ryzen 2600 6 cores 16GB RAM AMD Radeon RX 8192 MB Enough storage

I still have my PS4 and won't buy a PS5 at launch anyways, at least for a year.

My brother's birthday is coming soon so he'd be in heaven if we shared it. The world is a little bit fucked right now. I got some savings on my bank and I can keep working during these troubled times.

Already have a keyboard, 4KTV, a monitor and a mouse.

Main things I want:

GTA with mods, Fallout and Skyrim with mods, some nostalgia trips, in a few weeks/months VR (or now if I'll find a way to play with my PSVR headset), possibly games that won't be coming to PS4 when PS5 launches. If these specs can handle it. Some good RTS games. Cheaper games, massive variety of games from the last decades and not just this ""gen"".

VR games I definely want to play would be Alyx, Boneworks, Skyrim with mods and perhaps Fallout 4 if it works. Beat Saber with custom maps. Anything good that didnt't make it to PS4.

fpty6b,BlitzMillion,Motherboard + PSU recommendation,"Hello all, I recently decided to get into building my own PC. I have no personal experience but have watched a good amount of builds on youtube but still wouldnt know everything. I want to build it at budget of cource. I purchased an old HP PC to work with and then planned to buy a GTX 750ti to fit in later. I also purchased a PC Case. The PC case supports Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX. BUT the HP PC's motherboard is not ATX. From what I heard online ATX is a standard motherboard form so I presumed that it will be ok. Anyway, I never intended to stay with this HP PC case at all. (I know I'm defeating purpose of budget at this point but I'm 17 and have a part-time job that I work every Saturday and I can save up more if I wait a good time since I have to use a bit of that money to pay for lunch during week etc.) Anyway back on topic, I would like to have my build in that PC case and don't want to waste too much on more components so I want to use all of the ""good enough for me components"" in the new PC. So I need recommendations for a cheap Micro-ATX or Mini-ITX motherboard which supports the GTX750ti that I plan on buying, which supports Intel Core i5 2400 CPU, 4 Slots of Ram supporting DDR3 2GB (Have 4 of them) (Optional Features: USB 3.0 connector, Wifi) I also need an ATX-PSU that would support previously mentioned components. I would appretiate any recommendations and tips. If something here can't be mixed together on one board then please tell me what and recommended upgrade. My budget is about ‚Ç¨70 (US$ 77) for Motherboard + PSU but could try only stretch to about ‚Ç¨85-90 (US$ 94-100) Max.

Except I want to get into VR - it won't be used enough to spend a lot of money on it though. So could a 770 run VR titles? I don't mind running lower settings, unless the experience becomes terrible/unplayable at lower settings? 

If it's unplayable, what is the best (VR ready)  budget graphics card right now?

Also, what VR headset would you guys reccomend? My budget is ¬£400 absolute maximum, ideally a bit less than that. I don't mind second hand stuff if it's much cheaper.

I have a good 27 inch 1440p monitor which I use for gaming but am thinking if I should get another one for videos, movies, series and a bit of work.
I'd prefer to have HDR on it too.
Might play some games with HDR like AC: Odyssey.

Now, what would I need to be careful about while picking one?
I know that there are different HDR standards and stuff.
Plus, HDR and resolutions over 1080p can be a problem with streaming services on PC like Netflix.

Feel free to recommend something if you know of something decent.

The only  requirement is that I want to get a 32"" and I have no issue driving it as I have an R7 3800X and 2080ti.

I've read that going from 1080p to 1440p is a much more noticeable increase than going from that to 4K.  Is there any truth to that?  I've gotten to used to 144Hz with my current 1080p monitor that I'm concerned that a 4K 60Hz monitor might be a step backwards as well as if I have to run something in 1080p or 1440p on that 4K monitor that I'm kinda stuck at max 60Hz at lower resolutions.

1. Is there a way to change the operating system from my HDD to a brand-new SSD without losing files on my HDD?
2. Should I upgrade my ram? (2x4gb 2666mhz)
3. Do I need to upgrade anything at all? (Apart from the hard drive, I know for sure I need to upgrade that)
4. Is there anything else I should upgrade? I got a:

* Ryzen 3 1200 @ 3.7Ghz
* 2x4 gb 2666mhz
* GTX 1060 OC 3gb
* 1TB HDD 7200RPM
* Asrock AB350 Pro4

The reason I don't want to lose my files is because I am playing the Witcher 3 right now and I don't want to lose my progress when changing the OS from HDD to SSD. 

I feel like my PC got old very quickly so that's why I feel like upgrading but when I built my PC, people kept telling me once I build it I won't need to upgrade it for a long time.

Until it randomly exploded and thankfully only took a DVD drive with it as well as leaving some residue I did my best to clean up and a burnt plastic smell behind. My PSU was old and needed to be replaced anyways so I ordered a new one on Newegg and it should arrive in 24-48 hours. While I was uninstalling it, I kinda panicked and unplugged everything. I then realized that all my data drives were unplugged and I can't remember what order they were plugged in at. What I do know is that my windows 10 install / C is on my nvme drive and I just grouped all of the rest of my drives into a virtual D drive. Now my concern is that because I potentially plugged my drives back in the wrong order that windows will freak out.

fpqt1v,sliferodoom,MSI Z97 Gaming 5 Motherboard: JBAT1 Blue LED Error Fixable?,"**TL;DR:**

Computer has issue. I did the fix that the manual says will fix this problem. That fix in fact does not work. Help

&amp;#x200B;

**THE ISSUE:**

I was in the middle of using my computer a few days ago (playing games) when the computer suddenly turned off as if power had been cut (electricity was still on). This problem has never happened before and my computer has been running smoothly for years, so this is an odd occurrence. Upon trying to start up, the system VERY briefly turns on (fans start spinning for a fraction of a second) before turning back off again. If I hold the power long enough, the led next to the motherboard battery titled JBAT1 lights us as shown.

[https://youtu.be/uB2Sdy0FqsI](https://youtu.be/uB2Sdy0FqsI)

The manual can be found on the MSI website [here](https://us.msi.com/Motherboard/support/Z97-GAMING-5#down-manual). Now, on page 1-27 of the English section states that this LED indicates that I need to 'Clear CMOS Jumper"" (whatever that means). So, I tried multiple times to reset the CMOS jumper according to their directions. I used not only one of those cap connector things that the manual says to use but also a screwdriver. I tried to reset it about 10 times to no avail. For each reset I left the pins connected for a minimum of 5 seconds, a couple times I tried to reset it for up to 30 seconds. I tried to reset it with both the battery present *and* removed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other fixes I have tried:**

* Removing ram sticks to check integrity of ram (as suggested in another forum), both sticks of ram are not the source of the issue.
* Replacing the power supply. The issue persists no matter what power supply/cables i use.
* I have tried replacing the circular motherboard battery with 3 different batteries, same result with all 3.

fpqp3d,Miss_barfin,screen goes black only with adaptive clocking enabled,"when my gpu (gtx 970) is using the lowest clock available there's no problem

and when it's using the maximum clock available there is still no issue

but when it goes the state that it's between these two (not lowest and not highest)

 screen goes black, rebooting does not work and bios does not show up anymore,  I have to cut off the power to make it work again

Using Windows's safe generic graphics everything is okay but when i install gpu drivers it happens

same as linux, when using safe nouveau drivers everything is fine, but when i install the nvidia drivers same thing happens, however I CAN use linux, because it allows to completely disable GUI

so what i did was i disabled the gui and i configured my graphics card to always use the maximum clock and disable adaptive clocking and i enabled gui again and everything worked fine for months

the problem is that i wanna dualboot (probably) with windows but windows cannot really be modified the way that linux can be, so i can't disable gui alltogther and disable adaptive clocking, everything is graphical and locked down

Hope everyone is doing good and staying safe in this difficult times! 

I just had a few questions about the Ryzen 5 3600x. So I'm currently back home from uni for my holidays and I brought back my GPU (RTX 2080). However my current build back home is starting to fail on me. i7-4770/8gb ram etc. 

I was wondering if the Ryzen 5 will bottleneck my gpu and will it be a much better improvement than the setup I currently have. Bare in mind I'll be home till September so I don't really plan on spending a ton of cash. 

If the cpu is a good call what motherboard do you guys recommend that will get the job done and isn't to pricy. Also best 16gb ram kit for the money?

fppf2d,Schizug,Specific GPU in SLI Having Issues,"Hi everyone,

Recently I installed a second GPU for my 980 Ti SLI setup. My brother recently owned the card but upgraded his entire machine to a new one due to frames being skipped occasionally. I found that once I installed the GPU to my computer I also encountered the same issues he was facing with his build. For instance, getting headshot in CS:GO will give a half-second freeze on the screen. Before installing the seconds 

I am able to play most games fine, but recently tried playing Minecraft FTB: Revalations only to find massive spikes in FPS lag where a new frame will not render for seconds at a time. My performance graph looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/2Ta4yX4.png) and similarly in CS:GO when I get a spike the performance goes down, but not to this extent.

I have updated my video drivers and I am unsure as to what to try next besides removing the card as I would prefer to have two cards. Any ideas what could be causing this?

fpoa2n,r3311y,Finally joining the PCMR after waiting for three years to upgrade from my base xbox one,"I have waited three years for this build/setup to come together and here is the kinda short story of how it came together. It all started when me and my science teacher constructed a drone from scratch with no guide or instruction and he was like ""Hey if you like this try building a PC"". This was roughly 3-4 years ago and I was 13 at the time and unable to supply myself with the funds for a pc. I told my dad I wanted maybe 950$ to make a budget 1050 based build and he was said, ""ok maybe in a minute"".  He postponed it until the end of 7th grade - his excuse being I would get it as a gradation gift in 8th grade but that never happened so finally after enough begging, mid freshman year my dad said that if by the end of the year I had all A- in every class he would give me 1500$ for a gaming pc. I had kinda bad grades before this and after some hard work I managed to get all my classes up to an A-. But then, DUN DUN DUN. Corona happens. My dad asks to see my parts list and said we can go to Microcenter the following day. The actual build has a 3800x that was cheaper than the 3700x and a 2080 super. Full parts list linked [here](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/4VZ9yk) . I already owned all the peripherals at that point  Either used from my friends or bought for the xbox. I cant change the desk because my parents like it and some random person made it and its one in four on earth. I plan one using my setup for music production and obviously gaming. Any comments or suggestions would be nice and have a nice day!

fpo5re,GodGMN,Is VR worth it already or not yet?,"I have no idea about VR but I really like the idea and feeling of it. I've tried it a few times but i never bought any VR headset myself because prices are very prohibitive.

How is it nowadays? I saw a HL Alyx gameplay and I saw obvious downsides to it like having to turn with a button instead of naturally with your head because otherwise you'd get wrapped in cables.

The movement also feels off... Teleporting just feels like some sort of cheating, very unnatural for that kind of games.

However, I tried some VR games that didn't look as good as that one and I already felt like I was inside the game, everything felt real to me. So a game with good graphics should feel mind blowing.

I also really like the Valve Index (is that the name? The ""official"" VR set for HL:A) controllers, they look really really good and cool

How would you describe the state of VR nowadays? Is it good or bad? Would you recommend it? Do you feel it still lacks some things?",15,1585272935,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fpo5re/is_vr_worth_it_already_or_not_yet/,pcmasterrace,1

fpny3s,mopeters8,Loose GPU Fan,"Hey guys,

Just noticed on my graphics card that the third fan is coming loose. I have an Asus gtx 1080 strix, and it seems that the third fan will come loose and sort of fall off (just slightly).

Lately something weird has happened, on any graphics card stats programs (whatever you call them), it wouldn't display my fan speed. Would just sit at 0 rpm. Meanwhile inside the case, my GPU is going at 100%. After a little while I noticed that the third fan was sort of off, so I nudged it back in and it seemed to fix it. Immediately after, all three fans slowed down to normal and any program now was telling me the correct rpm's of the fans. It stays secured in for a while, and then will random just sort of barely fall off again. It honestly isn't too bad, its just a pain to take off the side of my case to just barely touch it for it work again. 

I was wondering what I should do in this case. Never had this happen before. Anything I could try? I checked my warranty, and it literally ended 20 days ago. Any help would be appreciated :)",1,1585272108,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fpny3s/loose_gpu_fan/,pcmasterrace,1

About a day or two ago both of my monitors shut off and my GPU fans cranked up to max. Despite this, I could still hear and speak to my friends in discord and my spotify was still playing.

I did hours of troubleshooting and I am sure it is due to the motherboard since that was the setting that was affected and essentially bricked the OS along with it.

My first storage drive is safe, I removed it long prior to wiping all data, and my other drives might just be fine. I have attempted to install Windows on my existing M.2 but the same BSOD still shows up.

fpnhpt,Carlos4D,Need a PC Guru for strange network problems,"&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys

I've been away from my home for quite some time, and I return to find out our ethernet connection is acting really weird, so who knows what the family has been up to..

Here is the problem:

I've started playing Call Of Duty Warzone and a bunch of other games, and I've noticed that both me and my younger brothers experience lag like rubberbanding, and what feels like ping spikes (Warzone shows around a constant 40 though, despite the lag taking place). This is weird considering a few different things.. 

The network has worked fine earlier, we all play with ethernet cables and not on wifi, and finally, we just got a new service provider giving 100/25, and it is still happening, maybe worse. I've tried pinging [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8/) and the router itself and I don't see any packet loss or huge lag spikes. Does anyone have an idea of what is going on here? I can't seem to figure out what's wrong here... It is happening on both me and my brothers PC, we have also been experiencing problems speaking in discord together, which wasn't happening before..

Please help :) !",2,1585270320,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fpnhpt/need_a_pc_guru_for_strange_network_problems/,pcmasterrace,1

I built this PC 3-4 months ago and first boot was fine with no issues.  
First 2-3 months, no issues.  
Past few weeks I have been getting BSOD/crashes about 30 minutes into playing any modern game (Three Kingdoms, Outer Worlds, CoDMW, HalfLife/VR, etc). Sometimes after the first crash and first restart I can play for a few hours without issue. Sometimes I receive a BSOD, sometimes it just restarts.  


I don't torrent, and I am really good checking to make sure software is from a 100% official/trusted source before downloading anything.

I completely formatted my 1Tb SSD (only storage I use), and reinstalled my OS for a blank slate. Still having the issue. I took my ram out and put it back in, then ran memtest for 10 loops with no errors. Made sure drivers are up to date, except for updating the BIOS. Temps all seem fine. No clue how to find the source of this issue, and I don't know much about the technical side of troubleshooting/diagnostics. This whole process is somewhat intimidating to me, but I will do whatever I need to.

I'm really stressed about this though, any help is greatly appreciated.

They can range between 30-50 fps. Some of them are like 36 fps, and others might be 49 fps. In my Shadowplay settings my FPS is set to 60, bitrate is 50. But whenever im shadowplaying something it gives me really bad frame rate on the clips. I have tried out OBS with the ""NVIDIA NVENC H.264"" Codec. But still it isnt as good as shadowplay, also noticing some FPS drops when using the OBS thing. The xbox game dvr program cant record 2 seperate audio files so i dont like it either.

fpmpoz,roflvopter,Planning a new rig got some questions regarding the GPU,"Hi, I want to build a new rig since my current rig is like three years old and I already noticed performance issues during Star Wars JEDI: Fallen Order or when I tried to share my Ori: WotW gameplay via Discord. Main use of the build will be gaming (mainly WoW but also the occasional current title). The possiblity to stream at a decent quality would be nice but it's more like an extra/nice to have thing.

As a basis I want to use the High Refresh rate build from the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds).

First questions: How big is the difference between RTX 2070 Super and the RX 5700 XT. The RTX seems to be better overall from what I found but not by much. Are there any specific advantages that makes one card better than the other in certain aspects? Also one question I'm very unsure about: what are the differences between the manufacturers once I pic one of these cards. What's important to look at? For me personally as little noise as possible would be nice.

* A 5.25 bay (For my Blu-Ray Player, not needed but wouldn't mind)

Also I have 16gb ddr3 as opposed to 4. To get ddr4 think I would need to upgrade my mobo too. Seems like more work/money/trouble. Dont wanna do it if I dont have to.

fpm83i,Lord3quinox,Problems Activating Win 10 pro via Win 7 Ultimate," If I am not mistaken, you are still able to activate Win 10 via a Win 7 key. I recently performed a clean install of Win 10 Pro with a bootable USB drive from Windows 7 Ultimate. Upon using my Win 7 key to activate Win 10, I am prompted with an error code ""0x80041024"" and that it didn't work, ""Check the product key and try again..."". I then tried to use the generic Win 10 Pro key ""VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T"" and it could not find a valid digital license (error code 0x803fa067). I tried contacting Microsoft support and they denied the claim that I can use my Win 7 key and that I have to buy a new Win 10 key, despite being able (or should be able) to upgrade to Win 10 for free if I have a legit copy of Win 7. (I did not upgrade from the media creation tool as it did not work so I used the flash drive as a last resort)

fplqqy,KapiteinKlootviool,My lovely PC died at the worst time imaginable. Please join me in pressing F on my now lifeless but beloved keyboard,"So my rig gave up on me when I needed it most. I had it on standby a few nights ago, functioning more or less as usual. When I came back in the morning to wake it up, it was unresponsive with none of the internals functioning. I tried turning it on a few times but I noticed it would shut down by itself after a few tenths of a second. I've since put a new PSU in and while the thing will turn on and run, the first time I did it I saw a flash and heard a pop somewhere on my expensive GTX 1070, near the PCI-E slot. So now I have a PC that technically boots just fine, but with a completely unresponsive GPU and no feedback from the onboard graphics chipset either. Ergo, it's dead and I'll need to somehow get my hands on a replacement card in the hopes it will function. If not, I may be looking at a total replacement of the motherboard. Maybe I can send my current GPU in for repairs, who knows, but it's well past warranty and I'm not expecting anything. Either way, this is a really shitty fucking moment for my main means of indoor entertainment to die on me. My only alternatives are my phone and a really crash-prone Xbox from the early 2000s so as far as staying indoors goes my options are severely limited. Worst part is, my bank account's looking pretty good right now but not good enough to impulsively buy an entire new PC's worth of parts.

In Fire Strike I noticed it seemed to still be at around 87C.  Decided to load up Borderlands 3 and run its benchmark with the meters up.

This is the temps right near the end of the benchmark. Technically cooler than the stock blower, but not by much, though I believe less throttling.

I know prebuilt PC‚Äôs are frowned upon here over DIY but I can‚Äôt build because I don‚Äôt have the time or knowledge to.   
   
-I just need something capable of playing RS on max settings preferred (or near max). 

-A decent hard drive for my wife‚Äôs shirt-making side-business that her and her sister do in their spare time (storing designs/running her Cricut program/etc.) until I can get her her own laptop/tablet to use. 

-Laptop is STRONGLY preferred but not necessary so if/when my wife is making shirts I can leave our computer/crafting room so I don‚Äôt get in their way. 

-budget is as cheap as possible but I‚Äôm trying to stay around $600-$700, which I know isn‚Äôt a lot but it‚Äôs all I can do currently. 

The computer won‚Äôt be used for anything else specific aside from just general web browsing by my wife or myself. Any help is GREATLY appreciated as all the different options is a little overwhelming.

fpjkl6,etesz,"No boot, no post, no beeps","My build:
- Ryzen 2600
- MSI Radeon RX5500XT 8GB VRAM
- Memory RAM (Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8gb)

-PSU: Thermaltake Smart RGB 700W 80+
- Motherboard: Asus B450m/a
- Case Sharkoon H200 Snow RGB

Okay so this is the things I tried:
- Clearing Cmos Battery, Changing places Ram or trying with one or change them of position, I changed the PSU and I changed the motherboard, still, 0 video 0 beeps, I think this is called ""POST"" okay my pc doesn't post at all, but all the fans and lights on the Mobo and CPU and GPU are working. I also changed the thermal paste of the CPU. Nothing happened.


The problem: all was good until it wasn't.
The pc started to give me a lot of blue screens and while playing the pc will shutdown itself after some time. Then when I was trying to fix it I somehow made it worse and the pc shutdown and after that nothing of the things I tried worked. I already bought a new mobo, a new psu and a new case (I thought airflow could be a problem in my older generic case), hell I even changed the CPU thermal paste.

So far the problem could be the memory ram, the gpu or the CPU (but people told me that the CPU is the least likely to break).

The CPU is 6 months old, the gpu has 2 months and the ram is 6 months too. I can't rma it because I'm in Uruguay.",34,1585256452,https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/fpjkl6/no_boot_no_post_no_beeps/,pcmasterrace,2

fpjj1u,miccris93,New Ryzen Build Keeps Rebooting to POST,"I was hoping my first post in PCMR should be more showcasing but oh well. Sorry if this has been solved before, I've searched and couldn't find a definitive answer.

About two weeks ago, I built my brother a new setup (specs below) and every so often it will reboot itself. Not a BSOD, but it will just cut out and go back to POST. I've reseated the power connections to the board, reseated the RAM, bumped it to 3200MHz (rated speed), updated the BIOS, and no dice. I just ran Prime95 for a good 10-15 minutes (temps stayed under 80C and chip stayed above 4GHz) and it did restart on me as I was about to end it, but my brother has said it will just randomly do it even if he is just on Chrome. It looks like I'm going to have to start RMA-ing parts to try and resolve this. Any other ideas? I am using some sleeved power cable extensions from Micro Center (Inland brand) so I may have to remove them and give recabling the entire case a go.
