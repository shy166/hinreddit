fq1opl,PoliticsModeratorBot,Megathread: House Passes $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill,"Congress gave final approval on Friday to the largest economic stimulus package in modern American history, a $2 trillion measure designed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and deliver direct payments and jobless benefits for individuals, money for states and a huge bailout fund for businesses battered by the crisis. The House approved the measure by voice vote, after leaders in both parties deflected an effort by Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican with a penchant for using procedural maneuvers to try to block legislation, to force recorded vote requiring lawmakers to register their positions individually. It now heads to President Trump's desk, where he is expected to sign it.

fpytge,Vote_Rajput_4_MI-12,"I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old progressive medical student running for US Congress against an 85 year old political dynasty. AMA!","I am Solomon Rajput, a 27-year-old medical student taking a leave of absence to run for the U.S. House of Representatives because the establishment has totally failed us. The only thing they know how to do is to think small. But it’s that same small thinking that has gotten us into this mess in the first place. We all know now that we can’t keep putting bandaids on our broken systems and expecting things to change. We need bold policies to address our issues at a structural level.
We've begged and pleaded with our politicians to act, but they've ignored us time and time again. We can only beg for so long. By now it's clear that our politicians will never act, and if we want to fix our broken systems we have to go do it ourselves. We're done waiting.

I am running in Michigan's 12th congressional district, which includes Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti, Dearborn, and the Downriver area.

Our election is on August 4th.

I am running as a progressive Democrat, and my four main policies are:

	1.	A Green New Deal 
	2.	College for All and Student Debt Elimination 
	3.	Medicare for All 
	4.	No corporate money in politics 
I also support abolishing ICE, universal childcare, abolishing for-profit prisons, and standing with the people of Palestine with a two-state solution.

Due to this Covid-19 crisis, I am fully supporting www.rentstrike2020.org. Our core demands are freezing rent, utility, and mortgage payments for the duration of this crisis. We have a petition that has been signed by 2 million people nationwide, and RentStrike2020 is a national organization that is currently organizing with tenants organizations, immigration organizations, and other grassroots orgs to create a mutual aid fund and give power to the working class. Go to www.rentstrike2020.org to sign the petition for your state.

My opponent is Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She is a centrist who has taken almost 2 million dollars from corporate PACs. She doesn't support the Green New Deal or making college free. Her family has held this seat for 85 years straight. It is the longest dynasty in American Political history.
