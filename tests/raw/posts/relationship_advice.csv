fsoggd,pengu1nhugs,A Question for the guys of Reddit,"Do you like when girls take the lead? 

Follow up Question: How would you feel if a girl asked you out on a date?",15,1585699177,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsoggd/a_question_for_the_guys_of_reddit/,relationship_advice,4
fsog3n,skrpz_,My [19nb] mom [50f] is having physical and mental health complications and won’t do anything about it,"Note: I’m nonbinary hence the nb beside my age tag but i don’t mind if you use gendered pronouns. 

My mother has been suffering through these spells of severe stomach and chest pain for a few years— maybe four, now, and we do everything we can to help her until it goes away. It’s not as bad now that she’s eating a bit better, but when they come she’s unable to do anything, and she and my dad (67m) have been fighting about this and that not being done since she’s spent the last two days aching in bed. I have been begging her to go to the doctor.

late last year she talked to me about having symptoms that sound like depression (I have depression, and many of the things she described sounded like what I go through in an episode). My response to that was, again, that she needed to go and get herself looked at, both by a psychiatrist and a physician, so we can find a solution for what’s ailing her on both fronts. 

but she just... won’t. I don’t know what to do anymore except attend to her when she has those pains, and it’s kind of taking a toll on me. it freaks me out when I see her like that; she’s just crying in bed, curled up. Today we fought about it for maybe the third or fourth time since she initially refused and she still, still won’t go to the doctor or make an appointment with someone who can take a look at her, if she does have depression or any mental illness. I feel selfish and horrible for getting angry and yelling at her but I feel it’s unfair to her and the rest of the family — we can’t help her get rid of whatever is causing this because she’s so against the idea of going to get checked out. What do I do? I’m so lost, and I’m so upset, and I feel like I’m at the end of my rope.",2,1585699147,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsog3n/my_19nb_mom_50f_is_having_physical_and_mental/,relationship_advice,1
fsofzv,blondesaunders,Revolutionary Road Movie,"Does anyone else feel like this move really rang home? I’ve always felt like I was going to make something of myself, that my husband and I were special in this word and different to everyone else. 
When we met it was the one main thing we found attractive to each other, we loved to push each other out of the comfort zones, take risks and think outside the box. However over 10 years of doing that and still not being “something” has given a lot of life experience, however it’s been exhausting.
I now feel like life constantly gets duller and duller. I’m not excited over the things I used to love and I don’t reach my goals. I am stuck in a job that’s going no where and can’t get out because hubby has been out of work for a year and a half, so responsibility lies on me. 
I see the years going by and we are not achieving anything, I just feel like there no point me sleeping 4 hours a day just to work my arse off building “something” so we can be that couple we always though we would be, that life just keeps throwing curve balls over and over that you can’t gain traction. 
The though of having a family frightens me to my core, especially doing it in a way that I cannot imagine living (suburban life). It’s the only thing I can control, but I’m also not wanting to push it to late and have difficulty because of age.",0,1585699136,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsofzv/revolutionary_road_movie/,relationship_advice,2

fsofhs,PSingh25,The family I [26 F]am baby sitting for might be perverts and not treating their daughter [12 F] appropriately.,"Okay so baby sitting is not common here in pakistan. But a family here that I know through a friend, asked if I could spend time with their daughter while they are away for the weekend. They are just in my neighbour and it was convenient so I said yes. 

The first thing I noticed when they asked me was the way the father (in his late 40s) looked at me. Well my breasts. He was not subtle at all. Usually i like men checking me out (regardless of their age) but this was plain scary.

I had to spend a weekend at their place and just before leaving he asked ""do you want the money now or after?"" And I told him I wasnt doing it for the money so there was no need. And he said very creepily ""I insist... a girl like you should be paid regardless of whether she is doing anything or not"" 

Their daughter over breakfast told me her dad likes horror movies and makes her watch them too even though she doesnt like them. She then said that after watching these movies she isnt able to sleep properly. I asked her did she tell her mother this. 

She said ""then dad has to sleep with me and gives me chills so I dont get scared"" normally I would have let it go here. But I had seen what her father was like so I asked her ""chills as in how?""

She showed me what these ""chills"" were. And the picture it painted in my head was pretty sick. I asked if her mother knew about the chills and she just shrugged.

fsoex8,GrayMatters0901,My mom makes my rules,"Okay. So I’m not a teenager. I’m 23 and not living with her. She says if I break her rules there will be consequences. I’m fucking tired of this. It’s so damn stressful. I can’t say no. I’m scared to. I’m scared to disobey her. I have a younger sister (10) and I don’t want to lose rights to see her. Help?

fsodl6,SmokedBalls,How do I tell my boyfriend he's emotionally dependent on me?,"Kinda long  TL;DR at the end.

I've been with my boyfriend for some time now, and, while I've always known it, I didn't really see a problem with it until recently. He doesn't really talk to his friends about any of his serious issues and he doesn't open up to anyone else but me. I've noticed that when I'm gone for some days (I went on a trip like three weeks ago) he gets upset, bored, and really really sad. 

I started thinking about it because I was originally going to go on a trip to Europe for three weeks in May (but i doubt corona allows it now lol) and was really nervous to tell him because I knew he would get upset. Then thinking about that got me thinking about college. 

I'm going to move to another country for college and will live with a roommate, which means I won't be able to call him for hours like I usually do (we're sort of long distance). I know our interactions depends heavily in calling. Texting isn't really enough. No matter what happens with us, I want him to be able to be stable and happy whether we break up or we're still together (even if we're together our interactions will decrease a LOT). 

He's told me himself that I'm the only person that makes his days better and that without me he'd be sad. I have told him that's not something I want (I'm more than happy to help him feel better, but I don't want him to feel like without me he'd be miserable because that puts a lot of pressure on me) and that we should work on it (opening more to people, therapy, etc.), but he's been saying the same things the past couple of days and it's making me really nervous about our future. 

I have no intentions of breaking up and will fight for this relationship as much as I have to, but regardless of the outcome I don't want him to depend on me to be happy. 

TLDR: my boyfriend has told me before that without me he'd be miserable. We won't talk as much in college as we do now but I want him to be happy and stable even if I'm not as present as I usually am. 

How do I approach the subject with him? He's a sensitive guy and I know the wrong use of words could hurt him.",0,1585698897,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsodl6/how_do_i_tell_my_boyfriend_hes_emotionally/,relationship_advice,2
fsod0k,DrawnUkulele,My (M20) SO (F20) might be depressed and it's ruining us. Just need advice.,"We've been together since November. Things are going very well, she's gorgeous and makes me laugh when we chat. We just don't chat that often. When we hang out I'll usually try to start a conversation or chat to her but she just doesn't have anything to say. She says that she just can't think of anything to say.

She hasn't got a social life, has gotten countless job interviews in the time I've known her but no job. Both of these factors make her really upset and I don't really know what to do. She says often cries when she's on her own because she just feels so down about it. If I ever ask her how she is, she says she's feeling unhappy just to various degrees. She feels since her younger siblings have all got mates and go out, when they can then it's just rubbing it in.

She isn't in education, is looking for an apprenticeship. So she literally spends her entire day at home job hunting or relaxing. She really hates her life. She has described it as being stuck in a claw machine never being picked, watching everyone else get chosen.

Feeling as aweful as she does, she often feels really down. And because of how she feels, she struggles to chat. Since in the UK we're in lockdown, we've had to resort to facetime and that's even worse. She's even less talkative on there and I usually leave the call feeling very unloved.

She's a quiet person naturally and I make an effort to mentally separate where she is being herself and where she is upset. She has said to me on multiple occasions that she wants to say something but literally can't think of anything to add.

I suspect she's depressed, I'm no doctor but it makes sense. I know I'm making assumptions.

I really love her and such a unique person, but I've found that I'm often unhappy when I'm taking to her.

What should I do? 

Thanks in advance guys.",3,1585698837,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsod0k/my_m20_so_f20_might_be_depressed_and_its_ruining/,relationship_advice,1

fsoax3,unsh1728,My girlfriend is thinking about breaking up with me because I’ve changed,"My (19M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been dating for 3 years now. She has recently brought to my attention that she had thoughts of wanting to break up because I’ve changed. 

I left for college about 6 months into our relationship and that’s when she said she started to notice me changing, being less outgoing and care free and overall happy. I know that’s a side effect of being away at school and being stressed with loads of schoolwork. 

She has also recently started a job which is proving to be long hours and stressful for her. Being away at school we don’t get to see each other much but now that COVID-19 has closed all schools I’m home all the time. We’ve talked about issues and things that need to be addressed in our relationship if it’s ever going to work.

The problem now is neither of us know how to approach this change. We both feel like we just need to reset but don’t know how. We’re in this weird phase of not really seeing each other and if we do it’s only for a couple hours so it’s hard to show change that way. She’s also brought up that it’s hard to tell if seeing me changing is really a change or more of me pretending to be something I’m not since I’m aware of the problem. The other issue is now with this pandemic going on it’s impossible to do anything with her. 

I recognize that I’ve changed since I started school and I truly want to change back to the outgoing and carefree person I was before school got to me. How can I go about showing my girlfriend that I can change and that I really want to put in the effort to make things work between us even though we’re stuck in this odd situation right now?",15,1585698631,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fsoax3/my_girlfriend_is_thinking_about_breaking_up_with/,relationship_advice,3
