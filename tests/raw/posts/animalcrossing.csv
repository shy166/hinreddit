Every start of the day I pick up as many as I could and I sell it to them. My house is right next to the shop so it‚Äôs quick. I barely see anything else on my island during this process.

So these suckers buy 30 tarantula‚Äôs from me. I make a cool 240,000 bells of these suckers. I laugh as the hand me my bell bags thinking These guys will never be able to pawn those things off for a profit.

I leave there shop and go to my resident service halls to deposit all my money when I see a red lizard there. I go talk to this unfamiliar face. She quickly tells me that she loves bugs and would buy them at a mark up. I did the math. I lost out on 108,000 bells. I guess I now understand why Timmy and Tommy buy them all. They invest and today they got to cash in...

fso1p8,pocketcactus,Too many things are locked,"To start, I‚Äôve been really enjoying New Horizons, but I do think it‚Äôs a bit disappointing that there is so much stuff locked in this game. Obviously native fruit has been around since the beginning, but native flowers seems unnecessary. And the mystery island ‚Äúrare‚Äù fruit being locked to one option every time is so upsetting. The mystery islands should have been the way to collect all the fruits and flowers. I‚Äôve played every Animal Crossing game to date, and every one of those games allows you to eventually have access to all types of fruit and flowers without needing to trade. Also, I think it‚Äôs really confusing that we have the option to customize items, but some items can‚Äôt be customized (despite the fact that a different color variation of it exists). Why are they locking furniture color?

I understand they wanted to have more multiplayer interactions, but I don‚Äôt think now was the time to do it. We have to pay for an online subscription now. For example, it‚Äôs a little disappointing when your lighthouse isn‚Äôt the color you wanted, and you don‚Äôt have the option to visit a friends town to trade freely anymore. This isn‚Äôt me complaining about needing an online subscription, because I have it, a problem I‚Äôve run into is none of my friends do. It just would‚Äôve been nice if everything was a least available to you over time like the older games, instead of locking things. The game is still really fun, but I hope this will be balanced with an event in the future, maybe.

TL;DR It‚Äôs disappointing that fruit, flowers, and some furniture colors are locked on your island forcing trades.

Am I the only one feeling this way?

What. Does. It. Take.

I am at wit's end trying to figure out wtf I need to do to upgrade the shack into the general store. I bought 25 of a 3k wallpaper which puts me at 75k bells spent and that doesn't include all the wares on the show floor that I have bought. 

I have read that it needs to be 70k worth of bells spent in the store to upgrade, but I've passed that with no indication of any upgrades. So clearly the manner in which bells are spent is largely the issue. What items do I need to spend bells on SPECIFICALLY to get points towards the upgrade?

After having bad luck with the random villagers (that don't want to leave even tough I never talked to them and complained every day).


I got one visitor to the campsite after getting 10 villagers, asked him to stay but he wanted to replace Rex, who I gave 10 gifts cured 5 times and talked to 30 times so I said no, tried 10 times he only wanted to replace Rex :(


Since then I have gotten no new visitors, and when I use a Nook Miles ticket the islands are empty without villagers maybe it because it's night? Does anyone know what to do?


Edit: even with 10 villagers and 1 campsite visitor I used to get villagers on the islands with the option to replace someone but they are gone now.",25,1585696270,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsnmy0/10_villagers_why_do_i_get_empty_islands_on/,AnimalCrossing,1

fsn49b,InfiniteBunnehs,Would you consider time skipping as cheating?,"My bf and I are in a heated argument about time skipping in AC. He doesn't consider it cheating but I do.

His argument: If it was cheating, the developers would've thought of a way to patch it. But they haven't so at this point it's a feature since they had plenty of games without attempting to fix it and it's not like it's a secret.

My argument: It's cheating because it's not an intended part of the game. The fact that you have to close the game and go into your SYSTEM settings to time skip means it's cheating. If it was intended there would've been a tip within the game telling you how to time skip. But just because it's cheating doesn't mean it's a bad thing. If it improves your personal gameplay and it's generally a single player game, then go for it. I do it, but I still consider it cheating. Just because they haven't fixed it doesn't mean it's a feature now.

Whatever you guys decide is what we'll agree on.

Update: Thanks for replying! We decided that it's situational. Like if you're doing it for bells or for certain seasonal fish, then it's cheating. If it's just to not having to wait 12 hours to get a bridge, or so the shops will be open, then it's not.",20,1585694496,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsn49b/would_you_consider_time_skipping_as_cheating/,AnimalCrossing,2

fsmz6p,Uniliteral,Money Tree Research,"Hey folks,

So if you're unaware, in New Horizon planting bells into the golden spots on your island will grow money trees. 10k bells is the highest amount that can be planted with a guaranteed 3x return. However, higher amounts can be planted with a chance of giving either 3x the investment, or just 30k.

I'm here to crunch some numbers and figure out the actual chance of these higher returns, and hopefully develop a strategy for maximizing profit.

So I went and bought a plot of land and went to some islands and villagers began to spawn again but in the two islands I went to I didn't like the two I found so I put it off for the next day.

I know it wasn't my original idea, but I wanted her to at least enjoy her birthday, so I decided to get some friends together to decorate and surprise her with a fun little Animal Crossing birthday party!

She was incredibly excited about the birthday Eevee I put up on the wall (as well as on the ground for the flyover) and squealed with excitement at the numerous gifts. I'm thankful I have such wonderful friends that were able to help me put this together.

Hopefully this little act will add some happiness to your day amid everything going on the world. Continue enjoying Animal Crossing and spending time with one another however you can!

fslyld,jgreg728,Animal Crossing: New Horizons did what I was hoping so much it would - it brought the AC soundtrack back to life.,"18 year AC series veteran here. Been in love with the games since I got my first GameCube game back in 2002 (out of sheer curiosity from the Melee trophies...). One thing that always stuck with me from that original title was its soundtrack, namely, the regular tunes that change by the hour as you traverse the town outside. Of course, the nostalgia is heavy listening to them now, but they really included some bops that are just entertaining to listen to. Each hour had its own flavor. You can tell how they were fine tuned to the specific time of day it was playing for. Some tunes made me feel like getting ‚Äúerrands‚Äù done like picking fruit and fishing for bells. Other tunes towards the end of the day just would sound like a ‚Äúnice‚Äù evening and calmer, sounding like everyone was getting settled in for dinner and bed soon after. But they all had a certain attitude or personality to them that set Animal Crossing‚Äôs vibe as a game.

From there however, that flavor I felt started to‚Ä¶.fade‚Ä¶a bit? Like Wild World definitely had a decent soundtrack, but I felt less songs stuck with me like the GCN game did. I‚Äôll look its songs up on YouTube from time to time and remember them fondly. But something seemed to be missing from them as a whole that I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on. City Folk reused much of the Wild World soundtrack from what I remember, so that game‚Äôs soundtrack stuck with me even less. 

Then New Leaf hit and I started to realize what my issue was with the new music, as it amplified the problem for me more than ever. While the hourly songs were nice and chill, and aesthetically sounded *good*, they all just sounded TOO chill. For the most part, they all sounded very similar, and didn't have anywhere near the energy or vibe that the original (or even Wild World) had.

Like compare the 10AM theme from the below two games:

GameCube Original: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHD10BeSqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHD10BeSqM)

New Leaf: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtxRvNYYUUo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtxRvNYYUUo) 

You see the comparison I‚Äôm talking about? That sense of wanting to be productive in my town or enjoy a sprightly walk around the area and catch up with my neighbors wasn‚Äôt being felt through the music anymore. Newer songs all just sounded like ‚ÄúLazy Sunday‚Äù music to me. Too calm. Little to no attitude. Almost in the vicinity of bland dare I say. And save for a few songs, nothing truly memorable. 

Cut to New Horizons.

Ok so let me get this out of the way ‚Äì until you unlock the Resident Building upgrade form Nook‚Äôs tent, the music in NH is deceivingly bare. You have the same acoustic song all day everyday when you‚Äôre starting out, and after a while it gets annoying. I get that. Probably could‚Äôve been handled better. BUT! My god do you get rewarded for your musical patience once the Resident Building unlocks. I haven‚Äôt heard all of the new hourly music yet as I like to be pleasantly surprised, but what Ive heard so far ‚Äì this is AC‚Äôs best work yet. Holy cow. I‚Äôm hearing beats. I‚Äôm hearing funk. I‚Äôm hearing addicting acoustic riffs. And they all have that ""attitude"" again. The 10AM theme in this game just makes me want to get up, hack some trees and start crafting for a town project. 12PM makes me want to enjoy the beach and get some relaxing fishing done. And in general this music really makes me love my island as well as the game as a whole. So bravo New Horizons composers! You‚Äôve not only brought back the soundtrack to what it used to be, you created the best Animal Crossing soundtrack yet!

I have 7 villagers at the moment, with the 8th moving in tomorrow. Also I have hundreds of flowers and trees.

Is it true that 8 villagers are needed for 3 stars? I've seen from other sources that it's possible to achieve 3 stars with 7. 

Also, I was wondering if anyone knows of any criteria for increasing the rating (for example how many furniture pieces/fences exactly are needed) or certain specifications like spreading them out over each acre?

fski5y,xvikkie,What fun activities do you do when friends visit your island?,"I'll start off: my friends and I have set up a thing where we would take turns hosting parties on each others islands. Our first activity was mystery gifts! 

Rules:

Everyone brings 2 presents and wraps them in wrapping paper. We all drop the items on the floor. We use a random number generator to determine turns. After everyone picks, we take turns opening and showing off what we got! It's really fun with clothes because we can show it off right there. The friend that set up his island had a nice sitting area along with party poppers... we were all on Discord too, we had a blast! Other ideas we thought of for future parties:

1. Easter egg hunt burying items in the sand
2. Hide and seek 
3. Secret Santa
4. Fishing Tournament (5 mins to fish, see who nets the most bells)

  
So I wanted to ask you guys, what fun games are you playing on your islands?

You don't get any of the DIY recipes player one gets from story mode. I have to be lucky to get a present in the sky just to be able to make a bed. We don't know this beforehand, so player one made a bunch of decisions that I can't change. There's zero connection tying me to the game. 

It's supposed to be a family game. I can't imagine the number of siblings fighting because one of them plucked all the fruits on the island and the other not getting any.",20,1585684088,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsju4r/why_im_going_to_request_a_refund/,AnimalCrossing,0

I don't want this menace on my island, he'll incite fear in my other animals and will make my town rating go down because of his ugliness. He is not welcome here.

This wouldn't be as much of a problem because he could share the same fate as Beardo. I put Beardo up in the corner of my island where there isn't a bridge to get over to him. However, this stupid overcooked potato is moving right next to my damn community centre.

If there's nothing I can do and he has to move in then please give me some tips on how to make it clear he isn't welcome on my island so he'll move out.

fsjh7f,JakobeFrogman,(Question) Successfully Kicking A Villager out? (WITHOUT Amiibo Card),"Okay, I know people have constantly posted on here about kicking their Villagers out by ignoring them, hitting them with a net, or complaining to Isabelle, but has anyone ACTUALLY gotten any success? I don't want to count actual confirmed methods like inviting someone from a campsite or using an amiibo card.

I'd like to gather data on it, so if you've actually done so can you share information about how far you are? For example, do you need all 10 villagers? How many days in a row? Which villager are you trying to kick out?

I've personally been trying to kick out Drago from my island but I've noticed that he's not as interactive with my villagers in general due to his ""Lazy"" personality. I've time traveled a total of 10 days, with each day talking to all of the villagers on my island without talking to him and I STILL have no results.

Hope you guys can help!",4,1585682952,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsjh7f/question_successfully_kicking_a_villager_out/,AnimalCrossing,2

Not to mention I'm also trying to pay off my home loan, raise money to sell land for new residents, and paying another 50k anytime I want to move a building.

Also, it would be really great if we could make things in stacks. For instance, whenever I go to make fish bait, it would be nice to use all of the clams in my inventory at once to make bait, rather than making one item of bait at a time for each clam. This would also be helpful in making fences.

I have a few questions:

1. Is this a meteor shower? (I did not receive an announcement this morning regarding the shower when I first logged in)

2. When will the shooting stars stop?

3. I have made about 50+ wishes and the stars are still coming through. Can I stop wishing and go about my game or do i have to stay looking up at the sky for the whole duration?

fsj340,gutanoth,Ode to the sea bass,"Ah, listen up. 
I'm the sea bass,
Oh, I see you got some tasty ace? 

Let me grab that real quick.
Make me a fish-stick.

You caught me and you said
""not you again""
That's just a pain,
A strike to my fishy heart, 
I fall apart. 

Nobody wants me, I feel so lonely,
I thought you would be my new homie. 
You shouted you wanted a barrel-eye,
But I could be your tasty fish fry.

Or don't you want me in your fish tank? 
I'll be an more loving pet than crookshank.
I would ask about your day,
Just don't bring me back to the damn bay.
I would remember your birthday, 
Or if you really wanted you could still your hunger and make me your fillet. 

Listen, everybody's got a dream. 
I even swam upstream. 
I traveled the seven seas and all the rivers, 
just for you, to get the shivers. 
Your face, looks absolutely disgusted, 
But I can be trusted. 

No wait! I'm at least a C-plus! Don't you see? 
Actually, I have straight A's, I even have a degree, from that one fishy University.

I could tell you secrets like Yes Atlantis is real, no big deal, it's home of our King Seal. 
I don't go there anymore, 
They don't even own a bookstore, plus the food choices are poor.

Ah, you don't want me? 
Gonna throw me back? 
That's just wack! 
I'll just go back to my sunken shipwreck. 

Before you're gonna throw, just know.
Wherever you go, Whatever you do
I will be right here waiting for you.

fsj1r5,Deliquate,Flower Selection at Nook's Cranny,"I've noticed that the more flowers I acquire from other islands, the more varieties of seeds I can acquire from the Nooklings.

I won't guess at the mechanics for the first few flowers that showed up at my shop; I got a rotating selection of rose, hyacinth, and windflower. I \*think\* I found hyacinth from a mystery island on the first or second day, prompting it to show up at my shop, but I'm not positive. No clue about the windflowers.

What I \*am\* sure about is that I recently went on buying expeditions to other islands (thanks, redditors!) for pansy and tulip and lily. Pansies showed up in my shop soon after the first ones bloomed and my tulips have been blooming for two days and as of this morning, for the first time, I can buy tulip seeds in my shop.

My Nook's Cranny has one upgrade--it's a shop, not part of resident services anymore, but I'm NOT time traveling and I haven't upgraded to the fancier store. I've seen other posts/youtube videos theorizing that the expanding seed selection at the store is tied to upgrading the shop and I can say with certainty that this is not the case.

Edited to add: I was able to buy yellow and white tulips from the redditor who let me visit their island, but I was missing red. The tulips at the shop this morning were RED. ",2,1585681614,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsj1r5/flower_selection_at_nooks_cranny/,AnimalCrossing,2

On top of all of that, she has, like, a quarter of recipes I have and she can't but ANY of them. She can't even participate in the hot item of the day because she doesn't have the recipe. 

So. What the hell is this? My wife feels like she's just in the background and can't contribute much to the island. I mean, sure, there's ways around it; telling her to harvest in my stead. But man. That just doesn't feel very...animal crossing, to me. I guess.

fsigyh,Novapophis,A quick Stringfish &amp; Golden Trout Guide: Dawn of the Final Day edition!,"My friends and I were working on getting the Stringfish over the last few days and I thought I'd make a quick post on all of our findings, for those of us that are still trying to get it on the last day! Note, this guide also works for the Golden Trout, but the trout is available during April giving us more time.

Here's a video &amp; image showing the strategy we used, with details on how/why below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGl27ZLUaw4&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGl27ZLUaw4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

[https://i.imgur.com/u8Mxeo7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/u8Mxeo7.jpg)

**Here are some things we found:**

* Stringfish can be caught anywhere on the second level. We had catches at points A and B in the diagram. Waterfall or River source seems to be irrelevant.
* Stringfish can be caught on the third (top) level in a pond, at point C. My island doesn't have a third level pond, but my friends does and that's where we got his (while attempting for the Koi).
* Stringfish appears to be the largest size of fish, and so we will only hunt the largest shadows.
* A lot of the internet's sizing of fish on the 1-6 scale is either missing some variability, or our group is just bad at judging the sizes (also possible). For example, Black Bass is rated at a size 4 but I swear I've seen some gigantic ones.
* There appears to be a limit to the number of fish that can be spawned in rivers on the island at once.
* We had higher spawn rates up top when running laps that included passing by and despawning the lower levels as well.
* Pole vaulting works well to scare away fish. They seem to have a higher chance at getting scared away if you hold the run button through the vault.
* Running around in this way was faster than any combinations of having some people get bait and some run around. All people running and calling out larger fish was the fastest method. Clamming/Crafting/Using bait was just far too slow for us.

On to the actual strategy!

1. Make a loop that covers the most river ground, prioritizing the 2nd and 3rd levels.
2. Only keep the Pole, Ladder, and Rod in your inventory. Drop extra rods / slingshots / other tools nearby just in case, but keep your inventory limited. Then you can hotswap using Right on the dpad (-&gt;) without menuing or using the tool wheel.
3. Test the camera angle views in accordance with how your land is laid out. I was able to pan it to the lower angle so I could see if my third level had a fish to check without actually going up there.
4. Try to cover as much ground as possible, as quickly as you can. You'll get a lot more spawns (chances at big spawns) the faster you go.
5. (Optional) Have a friend run a lower route on the first level doing nothing but despawning fish there, opening up more chances for spawns up top.

My group of 4 were all able to get Stringfish and Golden Trouts using this strategy in a few hours. It still takes a while but it was faster than any combination of people adding bait to the mix.

Good luck to everyone trying to get it on the last day! May your basses be minimal and stringfishes be plenty!",4,1585679838,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsigyh/a_quick_stringfish_golden_trout_guide_dawn_of_the/,AnimalCrossing,5

I‚Äôve had one campsite villager, and I also invited someone from an island.

fsi5yg,Monobrobe,Having two villagers with the same personality is the worst.,"I discovered Raymond. And I adore him. He's got a unique design, and he's so charming.

Then I find Lionel and decide ""why not invite him?"" Two days later, and I regret it so much. He says the exact same stuff as Raymond, just with a different catchphrase. It's actually kinda creepy since he looks like he's supposed to be older.

I don't ever recall having these issues in previous games, then again, it's been quite a while since I've played any of them. But still... it'd be nice if there was some more individuality. You have no choice but to have at least two villagers with the same personality since the maximum is 10 and I'm pretty sure you can't just keep it to 8 villagers (as there are 8 personalities).",2,1585678893,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsi5yg/having_two_villagers_with_the_same_personality_is/,AnimalCrossing,2

fsi5lz,TheCheeseSquad,I may have discovered something about the Able Sisters store. No spoilers in title.,"So remember in New Leaf, when you had to talk to Sable seven days in a row to get the QR code maker? Well, i got Able sisters 7 days ago (yes i time traveled then, haven't since) and today was the seventh day i talked to her. She mentioned feeling bad about not being able to have time to offer me a cup of tea because she's so busy. Then goes on to say that it would be nice to have an ""extra set of claws"" to help. Mable chimes in scolding her for implying Label, because she's trying to set out on her own and it wouldn't be nice to ask her to come back. Now pause there. 

Remember when you had to talk to Gracie Grace and complete her challenge 3 times in a row to get her store? Label is doing that now. But so is Kicks. I'm wondering if talking to them both might either 1) upgrade Able Sisters to designer fashion or 2) allow a bag and shoe section upgrade or 3) both. 

I haven't seen this mentioned any anywhere so far so apologies if you've seen this before. Just wanted to chat and speculate together!",3,1585678860,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsi5lz/i_may_have_discovered_something_about_the_able/,AnimalCrossing,5

Can I expect more Updates with actual additional buildings and characters? 

Or will we all have some seasonal events like the one right now with eastern and nothing else? I haven‚Äôt seen any answer to this or am I missing out on something?

fshk9k,Robsonmonkey,Why Are We Being FORCED To Trade?,"Like seriously, I had a really good plan in my head of where street lamps, vending machines, clocks and the like were going to go on my island but saw I got some awful colours. I waited and waited but they never changed, now I'm being told you HAVE to trade with someone who has what you want in order to get it.

Why put a huge focus on player customization and crafting only to restrict who has what item? I don't understand.

Have it random sure and make us work harder to get the things IN GAME we don't have but to trade with people. What about if, I don't know, people come home from work (people who are key workers with all this shit going on) and just want to relax alone playing this game. Not to mention hardly anyone I know has this game. Two of them have it and none of them have the colours I want.

Can we please, for the love of God make colour options available to everyone.

There's NO WAY in hell I'm going to waste my miles on things I want when they are the wrong colour, it's pointless. Especially if they do end up giving us options later down the road, I just don't see why you wouldn't have something so simple in at launch.

fshj2y,LivingDragons,A bug in mistery islands? (Pun not intended),"This has been driving me crazy for two days and I think it‚Äôs a bug so I want to know if it has happened to you. 

I usually go to mistery islands to hunt tarantulas around 6:30pm so I can clear the island before tarantulas spawn. If you check your Nookphones you‚Äôll see that all the common butterflies stop spawning at 7pm and tarantulas start spawning at that moment. 

I‚Äôve been doing this for a week and always worked just fine. Until yesterday. I go to the island, start chopping down trees, set my tarantula trap and realize there‚Äôs butterflies all over the place but no tarantulas. It‚Äôs over 7pm. I catch all the butterflies to try and force tarantula spawning. Butterflies just kept spawning until I left the island at 8pm totally annoyed. Went back to an island right away and everything worked smoothly. 

Today it happened again. Went to the island at 6:45pm, different island layout, chop everything down and as I‚Äôm typing this there‚Äôs only butterflies. 

As I said before I‚Äôve been doing this since the game came out and tarantulas always started to spawn after 7pm. However there‚Äôs something different. Both times de bug happened there was a villager on the island and I talked to them before 7pm so my theory right now is that both events are related. 

Let me know if this has happened to you or you have more info about it! Maybe it‚Äôs not a bug, maybe it‚Äôs a special island that spawns common butterflies 24/7. Idk. I‚Äôm mad I‚Äôm not getting my tarantulas.",5,1585676909,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fshj2y/a_bug_in_mistery_islands_pun_not_intended/,AnimalCrossing,3

I think there's an island favorable for stringfish fishing. I saw mentions there's a mystery island that spawns only bass or bigger fish, but I've never came across that, and I've visited maybe 12 or so mystery islands so far. I have 20,000 nook miles.. so maybe 10 visits left.

fsgzp4,GalacticArachnids,Turnip Tracker: Stay on top of the Stalk Market!,"Hey all!

I made a Google Sheet for a nice easy way to keep track of Stalk Market trends and to maximize your turnip investments! 

Start with the ""Purchase Price"" and ""Quantity"" cells to input what your initial turnip price was, and how many you bought. Then under MONDAY AM, MONDAY PM, etc. input the price that the Nook Nephews are buying. There is a trend guide at the top to show you what to look out for!

You need a google account, and then go to File &gt; Make a Copy of the sheet so you can fill it out yourself! then from there you can continue to copy and paste the rows as you need for more space.

Hope you enjoy, and let me know if the sheet is setup incorrectly, or can be improved. Thanks!

fsgv9o,BB2__,"My town is glitched ATM, help!","My glitch is very similar to the evicted villager glitch. But there's one catch to it, the villager that I got from another persons island said it was moving in (but I don't know if he was evicted or not). But I also later moved in an amiibo villager from the campsite. I had two plots and they both said they were going to move in their respective plots.
I boot up the game today, Isabelle says the camper moved in today. That's weird, the other villager should be moving in today, right? On the minimap it showed both houses as being occupied. I go to the campers house and it says she isn't home. Weirder, she skipped moving in too? I go to the other villagers house, it is also the campers house (but it has the appearance of other villagers house). And when I went inside, it was my camper moving in! 
How do I fix this? üòñ

fsgggr,SteamboatSakura,Reminders for NH players!,"Here's a list of daily reminders for everyone who plays New Horizons!  


**IT IS OKAY IF:**

\- You don't time travel.  
\- It takes you multiple days or even weeks of literal massive fishing or bug catching to pay off your house loans, no matter the cost of the loan. This also applies to work projects like bridges.  
\- You don't use the tarantula island method to make tons of money.  
\- You don't island hop/you conserve your Nook Miles for whatever reason.  
\- You take time finding the ""perfect spot"" for a neighbor/shop (even if you know you might have to pay to move it later!)  
\- You decide not to manipulate landscape/you keep the island as it was when you got it without moving, removing, adding, or changing river, cliff, and waterfall locations.  
\- It takes you weeks or months to get the Resident Service building/Nook's Cranny/Able Sisters/etc plotted and built.  


**Go at your own pace! There is no shame in taking your time and going by the game's pace!** I struggle with the feeling whenever people or friends show off their island and it's time traveled up the gutter just so it looks cute or whatever, or they brag/talk about making bake off of the tarantula island method to mass pay off their loans. It brings down my mood of playing the game and makes me feel like I'm going too slow just because I'm enjoying going by the purpose and core mechanic of the game.

That is to say, if anyone here does any of these (constant time travel to make island look cute or w/e, tarantula island method to make lots of money, etc.), there is no shame here!

I'm on day 5 and I have a few questions.

1. Do cedar tree give furniture or tree branches?  If not, are they useless other than for looks?
   1. Would cutting down all non-fruit trees and leaving only a few help me get the 2 piece of furniture easily?  Would it still spawn if there is like only 2 non-fruit trees on the island?
2. Is the best way to get hybrid flowers via the checkerboard method?  AKA (&gt;&gt;), could putting flowers in an (X) or side by side (--) not work as well?  Also let say they bloom in all available spots, should I plant my next flowers about 3 spaces away so that it can cover all area?  Also flowers don't die if you don't water them right?  Watering is only for hybrids?
3. Are there more than one trash boot recipe?  I have around 8 boots in my storage and would like to get rid of them since I already crafted those cute boots.
4. What do you guys do with your duplicate fossils?  Do you guys keep them or sell them?  These are fossils that are extra that Blathers already has.
5. How long do you guys plan to play this game for?  I notice some people want to catch all the fishes for this month, do they not plan to play this game for more than a year?

I have been enjoying New Horizons tremendously. However, I have been thinking about a few things that could be added to the game via updates to make it even better. Please share yours, I would love to discuss!

-Access to ressources in your storage when crafting. Dragon Quest Builders 2 did that in a very great way ; it is so much easier to manage inventory space.

-Floor square preview when using teraforming. Think of the white square that shows up to tell you which tile you are watering n Stardew Valley. It would make the tool a lot more precise.

Ps : This is a not a negative post. I love the game and I just want to share ideas with you guys.",2,1585672775,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsg86e/quality_of_life_improvements/,AnimalCrossing,1

fsflnd,Slowkips,Duplicate fences glitch,"This just happened to me. I tried googling it but couldn't figure out how it happened. 

I crafted about 5 stone fences. Placed them all down, and without switching to another tool I went to an outside workbenches, crafted 3 more. 
Here is where I think something happened.  After I crafted the 3rd one and my villager is showing off the fence, I didn't close out immediately. I got up and went to the kitchen, microwaved something and messed around for a few  minutes, all while holding my switch. 

When I was done I stopped crafting, opened my inventory, and had a stack of 50 fences and a stack of 7 fences. It did not use up my stones, and I definitely did not have enough on me to make that many. 

Not sure how it happened, but figured I would throw it out for other people to see or test since I could not find anything online.",6,1585670767,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsflnd/duplicate_fences_glitch/,AnimalCrossing,2

Since launch I've tried to build my island in a northern style, a bit viking-like (take ""Burk"" from Dragons the movie, as reference). I've been spacing out a lot my building and keeping this wild nature a bit everywhere (especially cedars). Also tried to add specific furnitures to replicate this atmosphere (ex: build square stone fences on the top montain to replicate sheeps enclosures.

While I am not disapointed, I feel it lacks a bit of ""oomph"".

fsew1q,jcrist11,My Experience Successfully Catching a String Fish,"Hey Guys,

Like you, my fianc√© and I had been trying everyday to catch a string fish before the month ends in the northern hemisphere. We tried all the tricks, threw out countless fish bait and still could not get a snag. Last night I was able to catch six string fish without using any sort of fish bait. This is how it happened for us:

I had been going on mystery island trips to try and get tarantula island because flick was at my island. I didn‚Äôt get to tarantula island, however, I did get to a nice bass island. The island was shaped in a circle and there were no rivers mouths. There were only three levels of the island with ponds and river top cliffs, making the river top fishing super simple. 

On this island, only large shadowed fish spawn (black bass and string fish in the fresh water locations and sea bass, red snapper, football fish, flounder and Orefish in the sea). I stood my ground on the second level of the cliffs and scared away all shadows until I saw one that looked a tad bigger. I threw my cast in and low and behold a string fish was caught. 

You obviously can just religiously fish and catch a bunch of sea bass until you find a string fish just in case you aren‚Äôt confident but I wanted to share my experience. 

So, it being the last day of March, I encourage you to take a few trips to mystery islands until you see a good one with only large looking fish shadows and some cliffs. It isn‚Äôt much help and I apologize if it doesn‚Äôt work for you, but I am rooting for you and your string fish endeavors!!",0,1585668442,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsew1q/my_experience_successfully_catching_a_string_fish/,AnimalCrossing,3

fsetl1,OxonianLane,Money Tree probability maths,"[This blog post](https://hpgross.tumblr.com/post/614115306425679872/animal-crossing-bell-trees) charts out the math for money trees.

Key points for non-mathie folk:

‚Ä¢ Money Tree either produces a max of 30k (10,000 x3, or 20k profit), or sometimes it can be a special tree that gives you x3 of whatever you put in (like 99k x3!).

‚Ä¢ We don't know the probability of when Money Trees produce more than 30k, but we can make some speculations.

‚Ä¢ If the odds of getting a special money tree is 1/3 (which it probably is, because Nintendo), it makes no difference if you put in 10k or more than that ‚Äî over time *you'll get the same profit*.

-- If you enjoy the experience of gambling (risking individual investiments, but over time it evening out), put in &gt;10k.

-- If you want returns to be more constant/reliable, put in 10k every time.

‚Ä¢ If the odds of getting a special money tree are worse than 1/3 (like if only every 5th money tree is a winner), you will lose bells over time if you put in more than 10k.

‚Ä¢ If the odds are better (like 1/2), then always put in max bells for bigger profits over time. (This seems not to be the case though.)

BOTTOM LINE: Probably Nintendo set the probability to make it make no difference to profit whether you put in 10k bells or more than that, so it's just about whether you enjoy risk or prefer reliability.

There's a chance the risky move is strictly worse. Until we find out the true probability, we can't say for sure.",3,1585668215,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsetl1/money_tree_probability_maths/,AnimalCrossing,4

fse5vx,RjLantern,Bad at pixel art and hoping for some help,"I have repeatedly tried to make a flower design for my island flag. Named my island Jonquil (it's like a daffodil) and was going to make a flag with the flower on it, but keep failing miserably. I love the ones with the white petals and the darker yellow/orange centers. The ones that have the shorter cone things in the middle. Anyone good or decent at pixel art able to make one for me? 

I have all the fruits (when trees finish growing) and bamboo, and would be happy to bring you some (or have you visit to collect) in exchange for your help!

ETA: apparently I grew up all these years believing the flowers I loved were called jonquil, but it's likely actually a Poet's Narcissa (same family almost identical shape, but diff coloring from the yellow jonquil).

fse3ve,andintotheblue,Villagers moving in without your knowledge,"Hey, everyone. I just had something happen in my game and was wondering if it had happened to anyone else because it left me confused.

On Sunday, I picked out a plot for a future villager. This is the plot you have to pay Tom Nook 10,000 bells to set up. I had already invited my first campsite villager, if that‚Äôs of any relevance. Late last night, I was preparing to go to a mystery island to see if I found any villagers I wanted to invite to my island. But before I did, I spoke to a villager who was like ‚Äúdid you hear Pancetti is moving in tomorrow?‚Äù And I was like ???? I hadn‚Äôt met her through the campsite or on a mystery island so I was super confused as to how she was moving in, especially since it had only been a day since I put the plot down. I‚Äôm kind of bummed because she took a spot that could‚Äôve gone to someone I actually really wanted on my island.

Has this happened to anyone else? Is there some kind of time limit you have for finding a villager to move into a space you‚Äôve picked out in advance?",1,1585665785,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fse3ve/villagers_moving_in_without_your_knowledge/,AnimalCrossing,3

fsdmz1,MarcusSandstet,THINGS NINTENDO SHOULD ADD IN NEW HORIZONS!!,"My English is really bad, but I really want to spread this idea me and my friends came up with.


If you have ever played the old animal crossing games you realize that new horizons are missing a ton of non-villagers NPCs and a mean a TON of NPCs like Blanca, Cyrus, Reese, Rover, Redd, Digby. We also have NPCs who have been in every animal crossing game so far except new horizons like: Pete, Pelly, tortmimer, nat, resseti ( I know he's the rescue guy but we never see him and his friend) It‚Äôs a shame that these NPCs did not make it so I have a suggestion.

Nintendo should add a kind of shopping center like new leaf and city folks. You could get there by the dock on you island and it would either be free or cost bells. In the center you should find many more shops like: 

- a recycle shop where you could sell furniture you don‚Äôt need for more bells.

- Dr shrunks nightclub from the new leaf where k.k. slider would perform every Saturday. 

-You could have a Leifs garden shop (timmy and tommy sells flower yes but) There you could maybe buy nature themed furniture and a whole more selection of flowers and bushes. 

-There could be Harriet‚Äôs hair saloon with more hair alternatives. 

-Katrina could also make an appearance with her tent and wisdom. 

- The HHA headquarters should also be there where you could see your friend‚Äôs interior designs and such.

- The dream place should also make a comeback and the entire dream system as well.

- Your old villagers who have moved out could walk around in the Center plaza and you could talk to them like old times.

And for the main island:

- There would be nice if more NPCs like redd and katie showed up. 

-there should also be a kind of shrine where you could sit and reminisce about the island‚Äôs history like the plaza tree in new leaf. 

- A thing I‚Äôve seen many complain about is also the island music, its really repetitive (after you get the town hall) so there should be an app where you can change the music from any animal crossings 24-hour music. GameCube version slaps!!

- They should also add the post office and remove the letter mechanic from the airport because that is horrible. buying your set of letters and writing them out in the nature was the best and you could post them any time. Now buying one letter at the time and writing it in the airport is weird. Therefore, they should bring back the post office and Pete and the others.

- I know this is not going to happen but the island is extremely small compared to what the switch is capable of. 10 villagers max is a joke (compared to the 2001 animal crossing where you could have 15) and you feel really isolated after a while. You don‚Äôt get the ""free nature life"" feeling that you used to get.",0,1585664097,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsdmz1/things_nintendo_should_add_in_new_horizons/,AnimalCrossing,1

About 5 min later a 2nd friend joins my game and we are fishing.  While going to sell I see that I have a SECOND plan for the robot.  This should be impossible since once you buy the item it disappears from the shop.

I checked my miles and I was down from 29,000 before my purchase to 19,000.  Never once used the machine a 2nd time so I have no idea how or why it bought two of them.

fsch5b,kfmush,Am I the only one who can't stand the way the background music changes after Isabelle shows up?,"Obligatory I'm loving the game and it's objectively the best AC, yet (still on the fence as to favorites).

And I love (loved?) The music of the game when I first started playing. It was calm, quiet, and relaxing‚Äîjust like AC music always has been and probably always should be. During our quarentine, I've been enjoying waking up and making a cup of coffee and doing some.morning chores in New Horizon. 

Until today...

Yesterday, Town Hall finished construction and Isabelle showed up (yay!). It was 8 am. I immediately noticed that the music changed from it's quiet morning twinkle to a bassy, rock-rhythmed, cheesy, short and repetitive, jam-band riff. I immediately found it annoying and not in line with the established aesthetic and themes of Animal, but soon recognized it as the games way of celebrating Isabelle's arrival. *This will only last an hour or two,* I thought and, sure enough, the music changed to something slightly more chill around 9, then returned to normalcy at 10. This reassured me that this transgression in music was a temporary thing. 

Then I fire up AC today and... It's still there... 

I'm tired. I'm groggy. I want to sip a cup of coffee, whack some virtual rocks, water some digital flowers, and chat with some anthropomorphic hippos while I chill out to some mellow and relaxing, yet chirpy tunes. 

What I do not want is to feel like Tuesday morning at 8 am is a rocking, lager-chugging volley ball party on the beach. I don't like this ""Its time to party!"" vibe that New Horizons is putting out early in the morning. 

I'm not relaxed, I'm annoyed. With the way real life is going right now, the last thing I want AC to do is annoy me. 

I can't be the only one who feels this way... Thanks for letting me vent.",0,1585659595,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsch5b/am_i_the_only_one_who_cant_stand_the_way_the/,AnimalCrossing,1

fscdzw,petran1420,Rare fish spawn delay using fish food?,"Hello all, 

Last night I went on a fishing excursion (much like all of us) in search of the stringfish at the top of my river. I had around 40 foods prepped; I was very lucky and got mine within that amount, probably with my 28th try or so. 

I did notice when the eventual stringfish spawned using my food, it took a little longer to appear after I tossed the food than normal; maybe like, 1  or 1.25 seconds instead 0.25 seconds. Not too much longer of course, but long enough that I started walking around the pond to see if I missed it, before it came up. I figured it was just random, but I went down to my pier to use my remaining food and caught a Tuna- and that rare fish also took longer to appear than the almost-immediate appearance of the more common fish when using food. 

Has anyone else noticed this behavior? My completely uneducated thought is maybe the game takes a tiny bit longer to generate a fish that hasn't been seen before, perhaps because it wasn't stored in the more easily accessible cache? Both fish were previously uncaught in my game. 

Not a big deal at all, just an observation and wondering if anyone else noticed it. Good luck stringfish hunting all!",1,1585659226,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fscdzw/rare_fish_spawn_delay_using_fish_food/,AnimalCrossing,1

I'm wondering if a pink tulip next to a red tulip would be able to make another pink tulip.

If hybrids can also pollinate as their parents, we would have

Pink = white + red
Pink = pink (white or red) + red

fsb0ni,Davidobot,How to automate crafting using an Android phone,"Hey! So like many of you, I've been annoyed by having to spam A to craft fish bait. So I set out on a quest to find a solution. I found one that works quite well, so I'd like to share it with y'all.

Note: this will work on newer Android 9+ phones that support Bluetooth HID profiles.

1. Download [JoyCon Droid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rdapps.gamepad). This allows you to use your android device as a joy/procon.
2. Download [Clickmate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inscode.autoclicker). It's an auto clicker, √† la Runescape era.
3. Launch Clickmate and connect JoyCon Droid to your switch. Set up the macros as shown in this [album](https://imgur.com/a/LrA3RlF).
4. Collect your bait-ingredient either using your joycons or your phone.
5. Once ready to craft, get onto your crafting bench, select fish bait and launch Clickmate (action 3 on the album). This will just spam A for you for as long as you want.

Note: might want to set the click delay to 500ms in Clickmate settings to avoid timing out the connection.

Hope this helps!

fsazq5,sentient_tatertot,"I‚Äôve really enjoyed playing New Horizons, but I feel like it‚Äôs actually lacking a lot...","I picked up New Horizons the very minute it came out, and I‚Äôve been diligently playing ever since. At first, I was absolutely in love with the game, I mean it‚Äôs absolutely beautiful and charming, but I feel like they mostly put time into how the game looks rather than how it functions and content. There‚Äôs SO much stuff that is currently missing or that has changed from previous games that has kind of gotten to me... here‚Äôs a list of what I don‚Äôt like about the game so far.

1. They made customizing items in this game SO WEIRD. They‚Äôll have one item that you can‚Äôt customize yourself, but if you get really lucky maybe you‚Äôll find that specific item in a different color sometime down the road. Like why can‚Äôt we customize it ourselves!? I miss Cyrus, and how you could customize just about every item in the game! Speaking of I really miss Reese as well. 
2. Where are the gyroids, where are the paintings!? Are we ever going to see Redd again!? 
3. Oddly enough I miss the old way we used to send letters in the game. I loved being able to write multiple letters inside my home and then going to Pelly or Phylis to mail them all off. I don‚Äôt like how the new system is, it‚Äôs just not as charming to me and I find myself not really writing letters to my villagers as much. 
4. I hate to say it but I do not like the new randomized islands. I miss the island from new leaf where it was essentially still your little island and you KNEW you could go there to make a good amount of bells. Half the islands I go to I find literally nothing there I need. Especially peeved at how I go most the time for flowers I still don‚Äôt have or fruit, but I only ever see two fruits and two flowers. 
5. Bushes. I freaking miss the bushes. They added a whole new way to customize your town.
6. I haven‚Äôt seen anything about Katrina or Kapp‚Äôn. 
7. I‚Äôve complained about missing certain characters, but I also find it weird that I see Sahara, wisp, or Gulliver like every other day. It takes the excitement away from seeing these characters. 
8. So far , wetsuits and diving are not in the game at all. That was such a cute addition to the game, and I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd take it out. 

Hopefully a lot of my gripes will be taken care of with future updates... there‚Äôs just a lot of characters I really miss that were apart of the game for a long time. Animal crossing has literally always been my favorite game ever since I was a little kid playing Wild World, and I was really hoping this would top New Leaf, but I find myself missing it more and more.",10,1585652711,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsazq5/ive_really_enjoyed_playing_new_horizons_but_i/,AnimalCrossing,1

fsausd,imnotwallaceshawn,So... I think the game is onto my tarantula farming ways...,"I started tarantula farming in earnest like four nights ago because I just got the resident services building and I wanted to be able to build all my bridges and ramps as soon as possible.

First night went fine. Had to clear the island but once I did tarantulas spawned fairly frequently. Filled my inventory in about two hours.

Second night I hit the jackpot and got sent to the famed actual tarantula island! I was so excited and filled my pockets in record time! It was great!

Third night... not so good. Got a shitty island for spawns, ended up only getting about half my inventory filled before it got so late I needed to go to sleep.

Last night I got a flat bamboo island, which I thought would be great for spawns, but it wasn‚Äôt as good as I hoped. I kept getting mole crickets so I ended up having to dig a bunch of holes to prevent them from spawning... only to find that if you didn‚Äôt leave empty ground in the middle of the island tarantulas wouldn‚Äôt spawn either. Found a good middle ground eventually and by the four hour mark I had finally filled my pockets.

And then there was today.

Today, Flick was in town, and I figured ‚ÄúOh awesome I‚Äôm gonna make so much money!‚Äù Used my Nook Miles ticket annnnd.... immediately got the three tiered island that doesn‚Äôt spawn bugs at all.

I grumbled, invited the crocodile hanging out on one of the cliffs to move to my island, then flew home.

Not to be deterred, I went around and did some tasks for more miles to get another ticket. Eventually got the 2000 and off I was again.

Second island was another flat bamboo island, just like last night. ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù I think, ‚ÄúI know how to game these now.‚Äù

So I went around, cleared the ground, and dig some holes to create a central arena just like I did last night to try to limit mole crickets while still giving tarantulas a chance to spawn.

And so I ran around. Cleared off wharf roaches. Dug up mole crickets. Scared away tiger beetles. Over and over and over again. For two full hours. And not ONE single tarantula spawned.

I honestly don‚Äôt know why or how. It makes no sense. In theory I did everything right. Either I just got super unlucky or the game somehow figured out what I‚Äôd been doing and decided to put a stop to it. I almost wonder if tarantulas simply can‚Äôt spawn on mystery islands while Flick is in town. In any case, I grabbed the bamboo so it wouldn‚Äôt be a total loss and left otherwise empty handed.

fsatcl,SunflowerFox14,Tip: How to instantly move your most hated villager out (with amiibos),"I'm not sure if this is common knowledge but thought I'd put it out there for anyone who doesn't know.

If you have a villager that you absolutely despise, theres a fairly easy way to get rid of them without the effort of complaining to Isabelle (which can take weeks). This only works:

1. If you have 10 villagers (and therefore have the campsite)
2. Have AC amiibo cards for normal villagers

If you invite an amiibo villager to your campsite 3 times (over 3 days) and keep asking them to move in, theyll say that although theres no space, theyll ask a current villager if they'd be willing to move out.  This brings up a list of all of your villagers and you can pick who to get rid of. Then bam, thats your most hated villager gone.

I will say though that I've only tried this once and have heard its worked for others. I'm assuming that you can always choose any of your villagers to move, but if anyone knows better then please let me know (:",5,1585651823,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsatcl/tip_how_to_instantly_move_your_most_hated/,AnimalCrossing,1

**What can be there?**  
  
Think of this:  
* Maybe we can catch Birds later and there is a foyer for birds there.
* Maybe land animals, like wolves, bears, elephants, lions etc.. and there are habitats there.
* Maybe we can find artifacts or other treasures and those are shown there.
* Maybe there is something else going on in the future with Custom Designs and we can show paintings of villagers and other players there.

fsa7v8,Floormat3012,Are weeds the primary criteria for special villagers to spawn?,"I‚Äôve been testing with multiple different areas on my island what contributes to a special villager spawn point (all on the outside of my island). 

In the top right cliffs I have placed about 20 flowers. In the top left cliffs i have placed about 20 weeds. In the bottom right I have placed 10 trees and in the bottom left I have left it completely bare. 

So far in the past 5 days I have had 3 Wisp spawns, 1 Gulliver spawn and 1 C.J. spawn. Gulliver, of course, spawned at my south coast but all 3 Wisp and the C.J. spawns all happened in the top left cliffs, leading me to believe that the major factor in where a special villager spawn is determined but weeds (near coastlines), not trees or flowers or random coastal locations.

TLDR; Weeds **may** be a contributing factor for where special villagers (Wisp) spawn.",1,1585648660,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fsa7v8/are_weeds_the_primary_criteria_for_special/,AnimalCrossing,1

I have an amiibo coin and was able to get him to come to my campsite. He asked me to make him something before he left the island, so I did. After I gave him the item, I asked him to live on my island and all he said was ‚ÄúHahaha that‚Äôs a nice thought!‚Äù And ended the convo. I was confused so I looked it up and I saw players stating that you had to have a plot of land set up for that villager. So I set up a plot of land for him and tried again the next day.

Again, he asked me to make him something and when I did, I gave it to him and asked him again. He said ‚ÄúI have to give it more thought!‚Äù And that was it. I‚Äôm so confused. 

I saw ONE post that mentioned something about the process taking 3 days but haven‚Äôt found any other posts mentioning it so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs true.

Can you not move in villagers using amiibo? Has anybody else tried this? Anybody had problems or been successful with it? Did I miss something? Any help would be great!

fs7883,NorthP503,This game has created a monster,"I bought New Horizons because I played the original Animal Crossing as a kid and figured why not. I enjoy it. As a person who plays shooters and rpgs, it‚Äôs a nice break and a very positive/happy game. 

However, my girlfriend watched me play for a couple days then begged me to buy her a switch and the game. She has never gamed in her life. She grew up in a third world country, video games were only for ‚Äúrich kids‚Äù as she puts it. She has watched me play several different kinds of  games and it always amazes her. The graphics, the story, the ‚ÄúM‚Äù for mature stuff. So we both figured New Horizons would be a good beginner game for her. 

I bought it for her as a surprise on Friday night and gave it to her Saturday morning. By the end of Sunday she had over 20 hours played. She didn‚Äôt shower. She got mad when I asked her to help cook dinner. She pouted at bed time. She took it into the bathroom with her. She played one handed while doing her nursing homework today.  She did her daily work out as fast as she could so she could, almost passing out, so she could shower and get back to playing. 

SHE MADE 200k DAY ONE JUST BY FISHING. 
You couldn‚Äôt walk anywhere because she caught  almost every fish and bug and was saving it for two days for the museum to open. 

I fear I‚Äôve lost her for good. Thank you Animal Crossing.",11,1585632883,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs7883/this_game_has_created_a_monster/,AnimalCrossing,1

fs783a,Altyrmadiken,Don‚Äôt let me waste become yours!,"I thought, perhaps, if you dug holes everywhere on the beach except for one section you could ‚Äúforce‚Äù the game to spawn more Manila Clams in an area. 

The premise, of course, was that there were probably an amount of them at any time on the island, much like insects and fish on Mile Islands. By limiting the available points they could spawn, the game would be forced to spawn them into the contained region. The concept was, in my mind, similar to how you can force tarantula‚Äôs to spawn on some islands.

The method was, well, dig it all up except for a one-screen sized chunk of sand. Then sit and see what happens. 

Results:

Clams did spawn within the contained region, but not any faster than I‚Äôd expect. Perhaps slightly faster than that specific square might have, but much slower than if I‚Äôd simply run along the beach catching them normally. At least once they stopped spawning until I went into a building and came back out. 

Conclusion: 

Don‚Äôt do this, it‚Äôs a waste of time. If you do attempt it, for some reason, save and quit, and then enter again. Don‚Äôt try to undig the holes manually, that would be twice as wasteful of your time. 

#That‚Äôs all folks. I tried to see if you could cheese Manila Clam spawns, and you can not do so the way I tried.",3,1585632863,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs783a/dont_let_me_waste_become_yours/,AnimalCrossing,1

fs740h,hellomie,Thanks to all the Southern Hemisphere folks who opened their islands!,"Ever since the lockdown, my toddler has been going stir crazy. He misses all the things we used to do, but #1 on the list is visiting the aquarium (he loves sharks). 

I wanted to show him the AC museum but we don‚Äôt have sharks yet in the Northern Hemisphere. So I decided to try to find some people on the other side of the world.

Thanks to the awesome Southern Hemisphere folks who opened their gates to me and others like me so we could get our fill of sharks and rare fish and bugs! I had never played with people before and it was a pretty amazing experience. I got to chat with six people at a time. One person sent me some super cute furniture. One person opened up his island privately and even gave me some fish bait and a pole to help me out.

I fished and fished. I stayed up until 4 am yesterday and returned every possible moment today, and finally I got all my sharks! I showed my kid the whale shark and he loved it, but he kept asking where his favorite great white shark was. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to show it to him!

fs71nv,Leron4551,If Animal Crossing NH received one improvement tomorrow which one thing would you want?,"My wife and I were talking and we started wishlisting improvements that could one day be added to the game via an update. She then asked me if the game got an update tomorrow that only improved one thing, what would I want it to be? 

I would love better tool management (e.g. indicators of how close tools are to breaking, selecting tools from the ring using the right stick, an indicator of where you're aiming, etc.) I personally don't \*need\* any of those things, but I think they would be beneficial and would build confidence in folks to who are new to the AC games and/or video games in general.

My wife would prefer bulk crafting (e.g. ""craft 15 bait""), which I can also totally get behind when trying to go after those rare fish, but it's lower on my wishlist than the tool management thing.

fs6nis,Spuff,How I got a stringfish and 5 sturgeon in under an hour.,"TLDR: Use tarantula island trick on Waterfall island. Scare fish, run where the camera can't see river. come back, check shadows, repeat.  


\----  


So, this is the end of March so this may not be helpful for most by the time your read this. I was late to the hunt for the sturgeon and stringfish, and never tried until today. So I went in thinking about what my strat would be to get these two before the month ended. I had read online that the sea bass mystery island was a good way to get fish, so I used a ticket but instead ended up at Waterfall Island.  


Then I had an idea. Waterfall Island was 3 tiers, so it was a good place for a stringfish, and also had a single rivermouth where sturgeon would spawn. I was thinking about the tarantula island trick worked. It likely works because AC requires a certain number of wildlife to be present on the island at all times. It bases that wildlife on what's nearby. A completely empty island = tarantulas because their spawn requirements are open land. (I'm assuming). So I figured it was the same with fish. So I cleared out the entire waterfall island, and sure enough, a few tarantulas started coming, but with that, water seemed to have a lot more fish. So I would make laps around the island scaring the fish away, until I saw giant shadows (for sturgeon). I caught 5 sturgeon in about 5-10 min. Then, I moved to the 2nd tier, this was harder because stringfish have the same shadows as bass, which also spawn in this lake. But I did the same method, and 2 fishing poles later, I found my stringfish on the 2nd tier. The biggest thing to remember is to keep clearing shadows of small fish on the base/top tiers as well to make more spawn in the 2nd/3rd tier areas.

Hope this helps folks! Sorry if this is old information!",2,1585630158,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs6nis/how_i_got_a_stringfish_and_5_sturgeon_in_under_an/,AnimalCrossing,1

First week - M 97/91 , T 85/81 ,  W 75/150 , T 188/556 , F 152/90 , S 84/73

Third week - M 115/59 , T 54/89, W 88/64 , T 59/113 , F 113/98 , S 88/80   

Fourth Week - M 80/78 , T 74/68 , W 68/64, T 111/137 , F 551/151 , S 97/ 84

Now i know you'd need more data than that to accurately predict what your week has, however this at least gives you a feel for what you might come across. 

Week 1 and 4 have a clear trend, starting in the ""middle"" dropping for a few days, then slowly rising until you get your sweet nips. 

Week 2 is just meh all week.. theres profit to be had however its minimal and actually has more risk than going for gold because it teases you with the 153 making you think it might go up. I think the teller here is its lower than average starting point. 

Week 3 is the worst.. its completely random with not discernible pattern. notice the large leaps between the half day prices. 

Anyway Thats all i've got for you hope it helps. I posted my island last night and today but slots filled up quick so im sorry for those of you who didn't get a chance to get in and sell ur nips for mass bells.",8,1585629216,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs6g00/stalk_market_patterns/,AnimalCrossing,1

For those of you who dont know, its basically whether or not the villagers get along, and you can see this whether a villager argues with another and complains about them to you.

So my thing is, I wanted to know which villagers make the highest in scores on the compatibility chart. (Highest score being 15 with two villagers for full odds.)
Ive been trying different combonations of 10 villagers to see if they all get along and have decent odds because it seems like its impossible to have perfect full odds but i could be wrong, so im very curious.",1,1585627642,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs639o/highest_villager_compatibility/,AnimalCrossing,1

So I found out about the ""make your own tarantula island"" thing a few days after the game came out. On average, it would take me 40 minutes to fill my inventory completely (with 35 slots), but recently I've noticed that when I use this technique, barely any tarantulas show up and it takes around 1hr 30mins to fill my inventory. 

From what I know I'm following the correct instructions, so I was hoping somebody might know what changed? Or if I'm just doing something wrong?

fs5hhe,distracted_otter,"QOL: Crafting bench access home inventory, or having its own storage?","I've seen lots of QOL posts requesting/wishing that crafting benches in our homes could access the home inventory, but I was wondering...

Wouldn't it be nice if the benches had their own inventory/storage instead? That way, we could load the bench up with materials in *or* out of the house. Also, we could pick and choose what to drop in there and not have to scroll past all the non-crafting stuff in the general inventory when crafting.

Moving the bench would require emptying it first (to avoid cheating storage space). 

And the benches we find on randomized islands could have a few surprises in their inventory for us to loot while we're there. 

Maybe someone has had/posted this idea already - I haven't seen it mentioned.

fs3mo7,xRelwolf,Made a mistake time traveling a day forward and now my game is messed up.,"Hello all, I had just built my campsite and Beardo was my first visitor. I talked to him twice and he asked if he could move to my island. He was very mean so I wanted to reject him but there was no option to. I had to agree to it and he said to finalize the deal by talking to Tom Nook.

Now this is where I messed up. I wanted to time travel to the next day to see if Beardo would still be there if I didn‚Äôt talk to Tom Nook. So I end up fast forwarding to morning, I get a new Isabelle announcement, I run to the campsite and still see Beardo there. He didn‚Äôt leave and I was stuck. I immediately turn off the game but apparently it auto saved. I go back and synchronize the time and I get another Isabelle announcement.

So even though it says March 30th, it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm actually in April 1. I say this because I was able to catch a crawfish today. How would I fix this?

fs3mf8,Caelides,Fix for the Villager Move-in Glitch,"TLDR;

- Invite a villager you don't like into your island; they will move into the glitched plot

- Invite in another villager you don't like using an Amiibo; have them replace the villager living on the glitched plot

- Skip to the next day and both plots will be empty, glitch is fixed

---

**Requirements:** 

An Amiibo of a villager that you DO NOT LIKE (they will NEVER move in to your town); 9 villagers living on your island (the glitched plot will make this count as ten villagers)

---

**Recommended:** 

Willingness to time travel, another Amiibo of a villager you don't like (this one can move back in, I think)

---

**Explanation of the glitch:** 

The glitch is caused by adopting a villager from someone else's town, after said villager was forced to move out with an Amiibo. For example, Player2 has the villager Lucha. He hates Lucha, and wants him gone. 

He scans in a Bob amiibo; and, since his town is full, he must select one villager to move out. Player2 tells Lucha to move out, but being the generous person he is, he lets his pal Player1 adopt Lucha.

Player1 adopts Lucha; however, the next day, Lucha's plot suddenly is blank where Lucha's name should be. Lucha's plot is now glitched. To fix this, Player1 invites another villager, Ankha, to move in to a new plot. 

When Ankha moves in, two houses appear: one is Lucha's house, and the other is Ankha's house. Ankha lives in Lucha's house, and the home she should actually be in is empty. 

Ankha now is taking up two villager spaces, despite there being only one of her.

---

**The Fix:**

There are two fixes: one is guaranteed to work, the other is unconfirmed. 

*Guaranteed:*

The guaranteed solution requires at least one Amiibo of a villager you do NOT want in your town, ever. They will NEVER be able to move in. 

After getting a glitched plot, you need to have any villager move into it - they WILL be moving out, so make sure they're not a liked villager. You can Amiibo them in or invite them from an island. The invited villager, Ankha in this case, will move into the glitched plot and occupy two houses. 

Once they're fully moved in and you've welcomed them to the island, you will need to move them out. The only quick and guaranteed way of doing this is with an Amiibo. 

Once a day for the next three days, scan in the Amiibo of the villager that will be sent to the void. I used Chops. When the sacrificial villager is invited to move in, they will tell you that your island is full; however, they can negotiate/kick out one of your existing villagers. 

Kick out the villager in the glitched plot (in this example: Ankha) and go forward one day. 

The glitched plots will both be empty, and ready for other villagers to move in as normal. If you scan the sacrificed villager's (Chops) Amiibo again, they will tell you that they're in the process of moving and can't visit your camp. 

They will never be able to move into your town and will be stuck in purgatory forever. A small price to pay for salvation.

*Uncomfirmed:*

If you catch the glitched plot before another villager can move in, you can fix it my scanning in an Amiibo of that villager (in this case, Lucha). Lucha will move into the glitched plot and restore it to normal (needs confirmation that this works).",0,1585617707,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs3mf8/fix_for_the_villager_movein_glitch/,AnimalCrossing,1

fs3k7m,Caelides,Villager Move-in Glitch Fix,"TLDR;
- Invite a villager you don't like into your island; they will move into the glitched plot

- Invite in another villager you don't like using an Amiibo; have them replace the villager living on the glitched plot

- Skip to the next day and both plots will be empty, glitch is fixed

---

**Requirements:** 

An Amiibo of a villager that you DO NOT LIKE (they will NEVER move in to your town); 9 villagers living on your island (the glitched plot will make this count as ten villagers)

**Recommended:** 

Willingness to time travel, another Amiibo of a villager you don't like (this one can move back in, I think)

**Explanation of the glitch:** 

The glitch is caused by adopting a villager from someone else's town, after said villager was forced to move out with an Amiibo. For example, Ben has the villager Lucha. He hates Lucha, and wants him gone. 

He scans in a Bob amiibo; and, since his town is full, he must select one villager to move out. Ben tells Lucha to move out, but being the generous person he is, he lets his pal Ryan adopt Lucha.

Ryan adopts Lucha; however, the next day, Lucha's plot suddenly is blank where Lucha's name should be. Lucha's plot is now glitched. To fix this, Ryan invites another villager, Ankha, to move in to a new plot. 

When Ankha moves in, two houses appear: one is Lucha's house, and the other is Ankha's house. Ankha lives in Lucha's house, and the home she should actually be in is empty. 

Ankha now is taking up two villager spaces, despite there being only one of her.

**The Fix:**

There are two fixes: one is guaranteed to work, the other is unconfirmed. 

*Guaranteed:*

The guaranteed solution requires at least one Amiibo of a villager you do NOT want in your town, ever. They will NEVER be able to move in. 

After getting a glitched plot, you need to have any villager move into it - they WILL be moving out, so make sure they're not a liked villager. You can Amiibo them in, or invite them from an island. The invited villager, Ankha in this case, will move into the glitched plot and occupy two houses. 

Once they're fully moved in and you've welcomed them to the island, you will need to move them out. The only quick and guaranteed way of doing this is with an Amiibo. 

Once a day for the next three days, scan in the Amiibo of the villager that will be sent to the void. I used Chops. When the sacrificial villager is invited to move in, they will tell you that your island is full; however, they can negotiate/kick out one of your existing villagers. 

Kick out the villager in the glitched plot (in this example: Ankha), and go forward one day. 

The glitched plots will both be empty, and ready for other villagers to move in as normal. If you scan the sacrificed villager's (Chops) Amiibo again, they will tell you that they're in the process of moving and can't visit your camp. 

They will never be able to move into your town, and will be stuck in purgatory forever. A small price to pay for salvation.

*Uncomfirmed:*

If you catch the glitched plot before another villager can move in, you can fix it my scanning in an Amiibo of that villager (in this case, Lucha). Lucha will move into the glitched plot and restore it to normal (needs confirmation that this works).",0,1585617469,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs3k7m/villager_movein_glitch_fix/,AnimalCrossing,1

fs3idp,Rinbabo,Playing as Player 2 Sucks.,"Long story short, I'm really disappointed in how additional players are dealt with in the game.

For those of you who are playing solo, here's a quick run-through of some of the challenges of playing the game as Player 2:

1. **When starting the game, you lose out on essential quests.** For example, you won't receive a quest to unlock the axe, and you instead have to buy it from Nook's shop. Oh, and there's no direction on where to find the recipe in the first place.
2. **You cannot advance the island, at all.** When upgrades for the island appear, they'll only appear to player 1. Even more, player 2 won't even have the option to donate resources for building projects (such as iron for T&amp;T's shop upgrade).

I've been enjoying the content that I can so far, in spite of all of this. But today, I finally got pushed to make this post after asking Tom Nook what I can do and then seeing this:

https://preview.redd.it/43qup0irqwp41.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c8123ada9f49b524b6168f0020a4d27356b20e3

As if it wasn't already obvious enough, here's the game telling player 2 to grab player 1 in order to unlock more content and continue playing the game. *Amazing*. 

Hopefully, future patches address this issue, because I'm feeling locked out of a game I love. Anyone else in the same boat?",1,1585617278,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/fs3idp/playing_as_player_2_sucks/,AnimalCrossing,1
