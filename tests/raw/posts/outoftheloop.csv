fsm2vc,ACfireandiceDC,What is up with the 737 MAX scandal being so much more significant than other airplane crashes?,"[Link](https://youtu.be/0jTN0JD4I5M)

So, I hear about how this is such a huge scandal that every single 737 MAX is grounded and this may very well spell the end for Boeing.

But so many other accidents are far more significant, such as:

* The McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 with its faulty cargo door that would often explode and destroy the aircraft.

* JAL Flight 123, a 747 which crashed due to incorrect maintenance, killing almost twice as many people as the two 737 MAX crashes combined.

So why is the 737 MAX scandal so significant?",19,1585691173,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fsm2vc/what_is_up_with_the_737_max_scandal_being_so_much/,OutOfTheLoop,1

fsl9p2,Slow-Passenger,What’s up with $2Trn money for economic stimulus? Where does it come from?,"
I can’t seem to understand from where does US government’s $2trn economic stimulus money will come from? Is it from “their savings” of the taxes they were collecting from Americans? Or are they simply going to print some money and distribute. 

And if it’s printing money out of nothing, why does the decision takes so much time and why only $2trn, isn’t the limit unlimited? And what about inflation? So many questions but basic question being- where do they get so much money?

So the American government has decided to send $1,200 to each adult who meets pretty generic standards in order to assist with the current economic/financial downturn. 

This is great and everything, but it's $1,200. My husband and I are luckily still employed, but if either one of us was laid off or not receiving income at this time, that's absolutely not enough money to assist in any sort of meaningful way. 

$1,200 is isn't even as much as my biweekly take home pay. It wouldn't cover a single month's rent. Even the $2,400 my husband and I receive together wouldn't cover a month of our necessary expenses. 

Who and how is this money really helping? Wouldn't it have made more sense to not send families like mine a check, as we don't really need it (totally not complaining though!), and send people actually facing new financial challenges during this time enough money to actually tide them over for a month or two?

Is this a generational thing?,"I know there is a huge economy based on wet markets and the wildlife trade, and have seen a couple of articles about how they’re being “shut down”. Until recently I knew (and still know) very little about them.

The criminal trade aside, I genuinely don’t understand if these are markets that the whole family would go to for their weekly shop (as in would a 25 year old shop there too?) or if it’s an older generation, who after years of shopping at these markets, eating, cooking and keeping these animals as pets are just used to the conditions and it’s just a way of life? 

I live in Australia and have seen small wet markets (mainly seafood though) in Asia, however I’ve never seen one with mammals etc. so genuinely find it very hard to picture.

I’m vegetarian, but if I knew there was any risk of catching a virus from my dinner there is no way I’d ever consider eating it!!

fqukm8,EddyThe22,What's going on with all the Joe Biden hate recently?,"I'm not a US citizen and what little I do know of the current US political climate I've picked up passively from either mainstream news or (mostly) reddit.

I've noticed the general attitude re: the politician Joe Biden change from that of respect and admiration during the Obama administration where I noted several calls for Biden to run in the 2016 race. Now it seems the most popular mentality is that Biden is a villain with Bernie Sanders as the candidate of choice.

I understand observation whilst browsing reddit is a poor way to stay informed and that, as with any single source, bias will distort any conclusion formed but it's really got me wondering how opinion has changed so much? I know reddit tends to lean left so is it just that Sanders is more left &amp; Biden is more central or have a missed something Biden has said or done recently?

[Article for context](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/fd26g3/democrats_rallying_around_joe_biden_could/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

fqtxwr,The-All-ighty-ollar,What is up with the OPEC oil price war?," From  my understanding Saudi Arabia has increased their oil output   significantly after failed production target negotiations with Russia,   leading to Russia increasing their output further. The US has failed to   mediate any compromises and is also increasing output. Whats the end   goal here for any of the parties (including other producers such as   Canada)? It seems counter intuitive to sink the cost for your main  export when competitors will just match you.  
Is the timing of this with COVID-19 (lower demand?) a big factor in the decisions or just coincidental?

Hi all,

From what I understand Trump is doing something wrong? I question that because I’m aware people and states need more financial support right now compared to large corporations, but is the administration wrong or right for the way they are planning to spend the aid money? How does this plan go against the constitution?

Also, I’m having trouble understanding the accounting portion of this article and the effects on audits. How could something like this effect our national economy? Will it help or make things worst?

fqcepw,Revolutionary-Dog,What's going on with Democrats blocking the stimulus bill?,"I've seen a lot of articles about democrats blocking a stimulus bill to help in the Coronvirus outbreak, from what I've read the original sets aside about half a trillion each for workers and business (though I know this is massively oversimplifying it). It seems that democrats have been tacking on extra concessions to take advantage of a pressing and immediate issue. I'm conscious of media bias, especially from conservative sources, but it seems to me that this just looks incredibly bad for democrats and there is little other way to frame it?

What do democrats object to in the bill?

Why are they blocking it? What are they proposing?

But in the past few days I've noticed that feature is gone and I don't know if it's a new update or if perhaps only certain subreddits have it but I still wonder where it's gone and when it will be making a comeback as it is a feature I thoroughly enjoy.

It’s all pretty ridiculous propaganda. They are preying on the gullible and misinformed with some dangerous ideas and it’s driving me nuts. No information I’m giving her is changing her mind. It’s infuriating, she’s college educated and not a republican supporter, so I’m really confused on what’s happening to cause her to give attention to this crap.

She’s sending me stuff like this:

And this post from some fb group she follows 

&lt; Ok, unless you've been living under a rock these past few weeks , you would know by now that covid-19 is a cover for mass arrests of the elites and to remove the cabal from power. While this has already been happening under our very noses for some time, this combined operation is about to explode. The earth alliance which consists of ex and currently serving members of the military and SSP, government officials, and members of various secret service departments. The earth alliance is also working hand in hand with several off planet alliance members who will be rounding up those runaways who make it off planet Earth. 
While it is apparent the cabal released covid-19 (a bioweapon), the alliance are making great use of the impact this virus is having. The media, formerly controlled by the cabal is now pushing fear and panic with the intention of allowing martial law to be implemented to get people off the streets and safely in their homes. This virus is NOWHERE near as bad as what the media is making it out to be. The number of cases and deaths being reported have been grossly exaggerated to push more fear. This fear is to get the public to comply with the new travel restrictions and quarantines.  
Now my insiders within the alliance have stated that all countries need to be in lockdown at the same  time and once this happens, phone, internet and television will be cut off and a complete blackout of all communications will be implemented.  This will allow all the major arrests to take place without communication between criminals. This blackout will last between 1 and 2 weeks. During this time it is most important to remain calm and allow the military and alliance to do their jobs. You will not go without, any supplies you need the military will be providing so no need to worry, they are there to help you. Also during this time, many people will be removed by the military from their homes and taken to quarantine centres, however for most, these centres are NOT their final destination.  These particular individuals will then be relocated to underground facilities, other parts of the country, and other civilizations within our solar system, this is in preparation for the coming CME and pole shift.
Once the mass arrests have taken place and communications returned, we will switch over to a new currency system. From what I understand this new system will be much fairer for all. Over the next few months following this shutdown we will be introduced to the technology that the cabal has been hiding for many many years, including free energy, anti gravitic technology,  new medical technology,  cures for cancer, disease, etc.
We will also be told about most of the lies the cabal has told us including our true history, religion and what's really out there in the universe.
We Are entering a new era here on earth, this time next year we will be living a completely new way. This is a major very exciting time to be alive.
Keep positive and definitely remain calm

Yet I didn't even know until yesterday that Joe Biden was accused by *eight women* of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching last year.

Not even your GOP-leaning news like FOX. Bernie Sanders and Trump have been mum about it too.

Initially I heard we’d all get $600/month until this all blows over. But now I’m hearing that everyone will get $1,200? But the checks won’t come until May?

So, is that the correct amount? And will it be a one time payment in May, or will there be a second payment also?

I’m out of work until the lockdown is lifted, so I’m just trying to budget this all out. $1200 certainly won’t cover my bills/expenses for two months (if this lockdown lasts two months). But maybe if there’s a second check I can stay mostly out of the red.

What needs to happen to qualify for the stimulus checks given by the US government for the Corona virus recession

So I’m a 23 year old male living with my parents but I filed my taxes separately this past two years ‘18 and ‘19. 

I make less than the $75,000 limit before reductions on the $1,200 I would get. 

Would I qualify for the check or would living with my parents nullify my ability to get the check?

I don't get. So far as I can tell, these crimes were simply to hurt others, especially those serving and those most in need during the current crisis, and nothing of value was taken by the attackers.

fo3lzd,nextuser001,Is this new virus worse than influenza/normal seasonal flu?,"I hope no one gets the wrong message, the thing is, I want to take it more seriously but I'm just struggling with the facts around it.

The death rate of this new strain is similar to common seasonal flu. Many health officials (thought not all) cite this. So why don't we have an emergency for normal seasonal flu to wipe it out?

Right now about 15 to 20 thousand deaths have been reported on it. While WHO estimates around 200,000 to 700,000 die annually from normal seasonal flu.

I'm just really, really deadlocked in my mind to take the current virus more seriously as we don't treat the normal virus that seriously.

I've tried reading online articles but none convince me so far. The ones that report higher death rate divide deaths by known cases which is obviously off the mark as so many more don't go to get it checked (while everyone who had died gets diagnosed for cause of death). The symptoms are definitely not worse than normal flu, although a dry cough and fever seems to be present in most of them, which again, isn't worse, just a pattern. And finally, here in the UK at least, in most confirmed deaths I've read so far, there was always an underlying poor health condition when they died.

So, again, I just want to take it more seriously but need convincing or better understanding.",1,1585049503,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fo3lzd/is_this_new_virus_worse_than_influenzanormal/,OutOfTheLoop,1

What is going on with Celiac posts in most of the popular off the topic threads?

I sorted by popular to see what everyone is doing and feeling while in quarantine. However, I keep seeing Celiacs pop up without prompt, and going on about not bothering to eat in public or groceries in stock. We are talking about a video with ten puppies coming out of a dog house; an AskReddit thread about questions posed to doctors for a friend; a milk in acrylic video. None of the posts ask or pose a question to Celiac eating habits or availability of groceries. I'm lost as to what is happening.

fndo92,unemotionals,What’s up with that new cyber security bill the US Senate is trying to pass?,"So before I get flamed for this one as I know cyber security is a touchy topic on Reddit, let me explain.

So, as a Canadian, I’ve heard that our neighbours down south are abusing the fact that the everyone is focussed on Coronavirus right now to pass a controversial bill (https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-bill-governments-not-so-secret-plan-scan-every-message-online), granting the US govt access to every single phone call or message passed/sent/received on American soil, WITHOUT warrant or court order... 

Now I understand the obvious need for end to end encryption (I’m studying comp sci in school), and I agree that recording *every* phone call or message is kinda overkill, but I feel like I still have the “if you don’t have anything to hide, you shouldn’t be afraid” attitude about it. 

Like what, would they really care about my texts to my friends which mention what page of the homework I have to do is on? Or texts from my mom telling me to pick some groceries up on the way home? There isn’t really anything perverse about that, in my opinion. 

I guess it depends if they start hitting us with targeted ads (which they already are), and the extent to which this info will be used? Cuz like major corporations like Google &amp; Facebook already have all our data. Cuz we gave it to them. Sometimes willingly and sometimes unwillingly, for the trade-off of convenience. But I guess I still don’t see the major issue? 

TL;DR: Cybersecurity as a whole is becoming a big issue in North America &amp; other developed nations, there seems to be much outrage against it, but I guess I’m just having trouble understanding why as the average person “doesn’t have anything to hide” and major companies like Google &amp; Facebook already have our data.

Yes, I did tweet out asking, but as I follow and retweet a variety of things, Twitter's algorithm doesn't seem to favour me in other users' feeds. Also, yes I know I have a different username on Twitter and Instagram, but it's easier to mention ""kbhasi"" than it is to mention ""MustardOrMayo"" on the former.

It's just baffling to me that this shameless copy that also takes the liberty of taking spins from other intellectual properties such as their Freya looking eerily similar to Smite's take on the character. What's worse is that it has a large and active fanbase that treats it like a respectable game when it's not. From banking off on other pre-existing concepts to looking more half-assed compapred to other mobile games that actually look better with a better UI for starters. Heck it even gained a spot in the SEA Official games E-sports side and has it's own E-Sports league as well.

I am very baffled at how a a half-assed shameless copy gets more love and attention than other mobile games that have been made with more love and passion by the devs when it's nothing more than a LoL version of Heroes of Warfare (another half-assed mobile videogame that straight up plagiarized Overwatch assets along with others).",1,1584799569,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fmfgs9/how_is_mobile_legends_still_a_thing_and_is_still/,OutOfTheLoop,1

Gavin Newsom issued an order on Thursday night for residents to stay in their homes, in an effort to thwart community spread of COVID-19.

I've thoroughly read through[ his executive order](https://covid19.ca.gov/img/Executive-Order-N-33-20.pdf) and the[ California government's official Coronavirus website](https://covid19.ca.gov/), which states that ""Everyone is required to stay home except to get food, care for a relative or friend, get necessary health care, or go to an essential job. If you go out, keep at least 6 feet of distance."" Newsom references powers granted to him by the State Constitution and three particular Government Code sections: 8567, 8627, and 8665.

[Government Code Section 8665](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-8665.html) states:

*""Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter or who refuses or willfully neglects to obey any lawful order or regulation promulgated or issued as provided in this chapter, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punishable by a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) or by imprisonment for not to exceed six months or by both such fine and imprisonment.""*

flq7ez,onlyanger,Why is the quarantine in the U.S. set for an indefinite period/several months?,"Correct me where I'm wrong, but from what I've read the whole point of the quarantine here in the U.S. is to SLOW the spread of the virus.

As of right now there are about 15,000(most likely a couple thousand more due to availability of tests, false numbers thanks to our governments etc..) confirmed cases in the U.S. and shit if we really want to be careful lets round that up to 50,000, and thats still only .015% of the population and in most cases the symptoms are only mild.

Now I completely understand why a quarantine is necessary for a couple of weeks. Let's assume that maybe &gt;90% of the population actually takes the quarantine seriously for a couple of weeks, and we should have very little to no new cases popping up as the people who are already infected are in the hospital or are at least aware and are seeking some kind of treatment for it. Now I understand it can take up to several weeks for symptoms to appear, but that's ok because hypothetically everyone is already practicing social distancing, good hygiene etc.. and so hypothetically they aren't really getting more people sick and creating new cases. And so after maybe a month at the most, we should at least re open schools/workplaces or at least places that are essential for society to be productive.

I mean yea it sucks that a couple thousand (mostly older people) have died from this disease and many more people are sick and there isn't exactly a cure for it yet. (Don't forget thousands of people still die every single day from other causes and those don't even get reported or mourned). However, the real damage isn't even the sick people or the disease itself but the chaos that it has created in our society.. I don't really want to go on and on about how much shit has been affected , but this whole quarantine situation is starting to negatively affect me to the point where I feel like I truly am sick because of all these lifestyle changes that don't even seem to get better any time soon. It's not just me either, I would imagine there's only a small amount of people who are benefiting or haven't really been affected because of this quarantine.

Again I completely understand that people are more concerned about their health as a priority before school/work, and it would also look really bad if the government just kept everything open.. but after a certain point people need to realize this whole incident is being made worse by our own reactions and is legitimately turning into a bigger disaster than it should be.",1,1584685727,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/flq7ez/why_is_the_quarantine_in_the_us_set_for_an/,OutOfTheLoop,1

flg5x2,2zo2,"What's going on with Bill Gates's ID2020 ""Mark of the Beast"" digital ID program? what exactly is it? I'm beyond terrified.","This has gotten a lot of traction and has terrified the living fuck out of me for most that I do not fall for dumb conspiracy theories, this is literally the NWO/Mark of the Beast Chip/Doomsday prophecy YouTube videos from 2011 coming to life, I want more information about what the hell that ID2020 thing actually is, if it is even possible to know anything about it yet.

Bill Gates himself [said this on his COVID-19 AMA a day ago:](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fksnbf/im_bill_gates_cochair_of_the_bill_melinda_gates/fkupg49/?context=3)

&gt; The question of which businesses should keep going is tricky. Certainly food supply and the health system. We still need water, electricity and the internet. Supply chains for critical things need to be maintained. Countries are still figuring out what to keep running.

&gt; **Eventually we will have some digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has received it.**

A user replied with this comment below, as far as I know all of the websites he linked are trustworthy sources, unlike the majority of other sites that talk about this ID2020 thing:

&gt; No, he's saying Microsoft and MIT developed ""tatoo markers"" that show whether you have recieved a vaccine or not. This will be coupled with Gate's new invention, ID2020, which is a digital ID microchip implanted under the skin.

&gt; www.sciencealert.com/an-invisible-quantum-dot-tattoo-is-being-suggested-to-id-vaccinated-kids

&gt; http://news.mit.edu/2019/storing-vaccine-history-skin-1218

&gt; https://id2020.org/

&gt; of course he has more practice at public relations than me, so he can put it more mildly

This chain comment below has been copied and pasted on various subreddits talking about the ID2020 topic, this comment is 4-hours-old at the time that I am posting this, **has no upvotes, and yet is glided**, and was also posted by a literal anti-vaxxer:

&gt; Here's what will happen in the upcoming future:

&gt; First you will be microchipped whether you want to be or not. This microchip will initially just include information about you and whether or not you have received the vaccine or not. These microchips will be tracked using cell towers and other sensors when you walk into public places, stores etc.

&gt; Walmart already uses similar technology to track you when you walk into their stores. They have RFID scanners inside the metal detectors when you walk in the entrance and at checkout. They track your purchasing, what you paid for it, how frequently, and use statistical analysis on your buying habits to price and stock items. Many Walmart's also have implemented facial recognition systems. These same scanner also pick up the MAC address your phone broadcasts and tracks you using that as well. Microsoft was the company who helped Walmart create this. Israel is already tracking all citizens through their cell phones. Citizens they suspect are infected have been ordered to quarantine.

&gt; Eventually, these microchips will also store your bank account information. Cash will be banned entirely and you will just tap/swipe your chip to pay for items. If the government doesn't like you, or you are dissenting against your leaders, no problem, they will just turn your chip off. You will no longer be able to pay for anything, and as far as society is concerned you will be an outcast. A new digital currency will be ushered in. It will be considered a safe and official alternative to cryptocurrency that you can ""trust"".

&gt; Those who refuse the chip will be sent to isolated concentration camps you will not return from. These camps already exist. In the US, these camps are already stocked with millions of plastic coffins. Proof: https://youtu.be/IVMJu9wswMc
It will become acceptable to receive a chip because you will be doing it for the ""safety of society"". Those who refuse will be ostracized similar to those who refuse vaccines. These chips will be used to continually monitor and track all civilians. They will use rich and famous people first to implant them to try to convince the average person that it's ""cool"" and normal to get these chips. If you don't get the chip you will not be able to buy anything, and you will not be able to work. If you refuse to let your child get the chip, they will forcefully inject it anyway, and possibly put them under new custody.

&gt; Social distancing will continue to be encouraged, even after the virus is under control. People will be encouraged to work from home, use their chips to buy things online, watch tv, play video games, use their phones and other devices. Everything you say online will be tracked and monitored and linked to globally unique number which will be embedded in your chip. Large crowds, too large to be controlled by police forces, will be banned for ""health reasons""

&gt; This plan has been in action since at least the 80's. The public are already begging to be quarantined and protected. They too will beg to be microchipped out of fear.

I thought that everything seemed legit until there, but then we come back to the same old FEMA concentration camps trope.

I am confused as to what is legit and what is conspiracy fearmongering about ID2020, so I searched for ID2020 on various websites and was able to find this:

1. ID2020 has an account on Medium.com, and it published [this article from 2019 with only one comment](https://medium.com/id2020/announcement-certification-mark-88bba84c0018), so they are a real organization as far as I am concerned.

2. They have a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJHWeoXEE9LG3EzVBPUcwg/videos), whose most-watched video has only 12k views, and likes and comments are disabled for obvious reasons.

3. There is only one [English Wikipedia page that mentions ID2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers#ID2020), although ID2020 has [a Russian Wikipedia page](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID2020) that was created in July 24th 2017 and last edited March 6th, ID2020 has no Wikipedia page in any other languages other than Russian.

4. Every single other website, video, or blog that mentions ID2020 are outright conspiracy theorist websites, like Michel Chossudovsky's GlobalResearch.ca, TheLibertyBeacon, and countless of other Evangelical apocalyptic prophecy blogs.

5. From the few reputable websites that talked about this, it is some sort of digital ID system initially for stateless refugees, with the intention of eventually being applied for all 7.8 Billion humans on Earth.

6. It has a [BBC article from 20 June 2017](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40341511)

7. And a [Reuters article also from 19 June 2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-accenture-digitalid/accenture-microsoft-team-up-on-blockchain-based-digital-id-network-idUSKBN19A22B)

&gt; The companies unveiled a prototype of the network on Monday at the UN headquarters in New York during the second summit of ID2020, a public-private consortium promoting the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goal of providing legal identity for everyone on the planet.

&gt; “Without an identity you can’t access education, financial services, healthcare, you name it. You are disenfranchised and marginalized from society,” David Treat, a managing director in Accenture’s financial services practice, said in an interview.

&gt; The new platform will connect existing record-keeping systems of commercial and public entities through blockchain, allowing users to access to their personal information wherever they are.

I'm pretty divided and confused by all of that, what the hell really is that ID2020 thing? 

1. Is it actually some Black Mirror-like plot of using the Coronavirus as an excuse to put something like China's Social Credit system or the ""Mark of the Beast chip"" thing over the world?

2. Is it just some misunderstood concept that will go nowhere?

3. Or is most of it an organized troll operation to incite conspiracy theorists into finally reaching their limits?

In Curb your enthusiasm, ted danzer was offended when Larry side sitter with his wife, larrys ex wife. Larry said he side sits with everybody. But then in fact doesn't really.

So when he sees ted,whilst with a women employee of his, he was reconciling a issue with, as ted walked by, he side sitted. The woman noticed this, and 'refused to be side sitted on'. Larry held her til ted noticed and then let go, offending her and worstening their relationship.

Here's the moment when Ted interrogates Larry for side sitting his wife: https://youtu.be/ruePbpQ8hKQ

And here is when he side sits the woman and she refuses: https://youtu.be/pXQs5yP7iRE


In better call Saul, Saul Goodman asked his girlfriend Kim, about a scam she was pulling with other lawyers in the latest episode. Kim told him he sat with his side to them. This piece of information seems interesting to Saul, and about his character.

I don't have the scene, but it's S5 ep 5 on Netflix. I can't remember the time, but it's when Saul is in his kitchen with Kim.

Thing is, side sitting seems like nothing to me. And nobody I know ever in my country has ever mentioned it ever. 

People sit on their side. I do it, plenty times if there's a good view. What is so of interest in a person's character if they side sit?

To those who don't know, side sit, is when you don't face the person or people, you sit with your shoulder towards them, or you are sitting perpendicular to them.

I'd understand if you avoided eye contact, but all the side sittings I saw, the characters still had their head turned and engaged with the people they were talking to.

I can't understand why it would be rude.. Some people don't wanna put their legs under the table, they'd rather sit away and lean on the table instead.

Or they'd rather sit next to someone instead of oppose them. 

I've identified this might be a purely American thing.

Anyway, I hope this is a real thing and someone can explain the meaning of it.",11,1584585432,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fl2e38/whats_the_deal_with_side_sitting_and_why_is_it/,OutOfTheLoop,1

[https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/5e6waj/special\_snowflakes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/5e6waj/special_snowflakes/)

I know this topic comes up a lot in many subreddits, but even after reading articles and comments, simply put, I still don't get the idea of accusing other people of faking depression....

I don't get why seeking attention would automatically make him/her a faker..? I thought the whole point of bringing focus to mental illness was to let people speak up about what they are, or think they are, going through. Wouldn't silencing every voice be a worse outcome? I would've never gone to therapy and get treated with pills and therapies for what I later found out to be symptoms that may be due to trauma induced depression and anxiety disorders if not for me somewhat complaining about the lack of performance and overall will relative to what I am usually capable of, and someone else pointing out a possible problem.

Depression seems to be heavily linked with the term, snowflake generation, where the idea is that since many people have mental illnesses, they are weaker to external circumstances compared to previous generations (how do you even measure this?), and so they should suck it up. But in that case what is the deal with numerous psychological studies of mental illnesses and the rising budget into treatment of such relative to previous years? I thought the point was to somehow protect or take care of the ""weaker"" individuals....but we are criticizing this exact act at the same time? What is the kind of society that we are trying to head toward?

[Johns Hopkins Tracker](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

Meanwhile, every day I hear worse estimates for how many will be infected in the U.S. and how many of those will die. Just now I read a ""dire new report"" saying that 1.1-2.2 million Americans could die.

If that seems extreme, tven the NY Times has something up suggesting we could expect half a million deaths, conservatively.

Is that the little thingy next to the sub name? If so, why don't I ever see them? And how do you know others see them when they comment r/subsifellfor or r/subsithoughtifellfor? 
Example: https://www.reddit.com/r/YouHaveIcons/comments/fhfiy5/idiot_commented_on_a_post_already_existing_on_the/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

And the toyota corolla, I just don't get it. From the description and the posts I understand it's for r/subsifellfor type subs but *why*? Why is there a sub dedicated to those comments? And what does toyota corolla have to do with that? Is that some meme I'm unfamiliar with?

I’m trying to to understand what’s going on with the financial situation in the States. I sort of understand the interplay between the Feds buying bonds from the banks to meet to obligations of loaning money to companies who are up to their neck in debt for the sake of turning a profit.

What I don’t understand is: if a company cannot pay the loan back, it defaults. And then what happens? 

China has been buying US debt for some time now: https://chinapower.csis.org/us-debt/

A lot of recent political controversies have been focused on candidates' surrogates making blunt statements, bungling interviews, having held ""troubling"" views in the past, using social media in a way that's deemed irresponsible, and so on. 

**Regardless of the views you personally hold**: how come I'm seeing a swarm of stories that boil down to ""X or Y is a terrible surrogate WTF that campaign was thinking"", and is there anything like a conventional vetting process when it comes to choosing surrogates?

fhzjwz,Trenin23,"What is the deal with being ""left on read""?","I am technically savvy.

However,  when I see the phrase ""left on read"" I am unclear of the meaning, even  given the context of the message around it.

Here is an Example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cj166k/i\_just\_got\_left\_on\_read\_make\_me\_feel\_better\_lol/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/cj166k/i_just_got_left_on_read_make_me_feel_better_lol/)

Is  ""read"" present or past  tense in this context?  It seems like an  awkward phrase.  I can  understand ""left unread"", but ""left on read""  doesn't make sense.  There are few options that I can think of;

1. This is an evolution of language.  For example, ""on accident"" is now becoming common while some argue that ""by accident"" is correct.  ""I could care less"" while technically meaning the opposite of its intent, common sense means we should take it to mean ""couldn't care less"".    Semantically, the phrase ""left on read"" means either;
   1. the message hasn't been read yet
   2. the message has been read, but hasn't been responded to
2. Present tense.  Pronounced ""left on reed"".  Message has not been read yet.  This is a message that has been left in a 'will read later' state, or shortened to ""left on read (present tense)"".
3. Past tense.  Pronounced ""left on red"".  Message has been read, but not responded to.  The message has been ""left hanging around after reading it without doing anything with it"", or shortened to ""left on read (past tense)""
4. Someone verbally said the message was ""left unread"" (meaning it hasn't been read yet) and someone else heard ""left on read"".  This was transcribed to the written word incorrectly, but gained popularity until everyone now uses it.

In lots of posts that use this phrase, I struggle with knowing if the message was ignored so the recipient doesn't know its contents yet, or if the message has been read, but the recipient chooses to not reply.  As a result, I don't know how to gauge the interaction.

fhfqxi,ItsStevoHooray,What’s the deal with Case 1:19-CV-11947 relating to the CDC and vaccines?,"The other day my ant-vax mother sent me [this image](https://imgur.com/a/tH9nC01) that says that the CDC conceded in federal court admitting that “there are no studies that prove vaccines cause autism.” She said that this proves that she’s always been right.

Given that she didn’t send any type of article or anything beyond this picture, and the fact that I can’t find any articles form reputable sources by searching this case number, I’m obviously skeptical. All I can find is court documents that are hard for a layperson to parse through.

So what’s the deal with this? Is this a big deal? How long has this case been going on?

fhc1s0,Zerolized,What is going on with the increase of covid-19 cases? (USA),"I’m seeing so much news/reports of people testing positive for coronavirus seemingly out of nowhere. For example actor Tom hanks just announced he tested positive for corona and someone who was close to the president tested positive days before. not to mention the cases of regular civilians testing positive. This surge in cases makes me question, CAN fear/paranoia/ play a role in a accurate diagnosis of covid-19. Like if someone comes up with a really bad flu but people are leaning towards the probability of them having corona instead... can this lead to a misdiagnosis? How accurate are the confirmed cases of corona and ELI5 how doctors are able to differentiate (lab tests) between like a bad flu or them having corona. How accurate are these tests?

fgleo9,winterchillz,What's up with some prominent streamers supposedly giving away skins?,"Hey guys,


I've noticed that some streamers on Twitch seem to have half their screen covered in, what I could possibly describe, a bad ad. The messages invites viewers to write ""!skins"" or ""!arcana"" (depending on the game) in chat and there seems to be a link to a website, that I'd classify as a shady at best in their bio.


A few streamers like those are the Counter Strike: Global Offensive players s1mple and Shroud, as well as some very well known Dota 2 players like Dendi and Topson.


All the domains seem to end in "".fun"" and basically for almost all streamers advertising it, it seems as if their profile has been hacked as their bio field is only pointing at those websites.


For the Dota 2 streamers, it seems to be dota2-history.fun while the Counter Strike ones are skinssonline.fun and freequick.fun


We all know about some of the controversies in the past with streamers and YouTubers promoting gambling websites, but in this case we are talking about some of the most prominent and well known names in the scene and while that gives me a bit more belief in it, I can't shake off the feeling there's something really questionable going on when your stream looks like [this.](https://i.imgur.com/2IXEp9U.jpg)",6,1583875583,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fgleo9/whats_up_with_some_prominent_streamers_supposedly/,OutOfTheLoop,1

I am aware of the circulating use of the word Simp, and that it means someone who is being overly submissive to women and putting them on pedestals, but the way this word is being used on YouTube is astronomical. I basically did a video on International Women's day, in hopes of trying to educate some younger men to be more wary of the words they use and how it can be really hurtful to the other person. The whole video was bombarded with comments calling me ''SIMP''

In another comment i saw someone basically say ''women are our objects'' and when i tried to civilly explain why that is a shitty thing to say, i was again called a ''SIMP''

Shortly after i saw Pewdiepie upload a video called ''DON'T CALL ME A SIMP''. in one part of the video he said ''it's kinda sad you're not aloud to compliment women on the internet'' before abruptly doing a 360 and saying ''THAT'S WHAT A SIMP WOULD SAY''.

Is there something i am missing?? why is demonstrating basic kindness or calling out abuse or violence against a woman, making me a ''simp''?

ffubb9,pubgcommando,What's so cool about bad grammar?,"To make it easier to understand, I'll call ""rap grammar""; ""they be doing"" ""friend house"" (notice the lack of 's).

I'm not a grammar Nazi at all, but I'm aware enough to know when middle class suburban people start talking like rappers from the hood. I'm really from an area where ""they be talking like this"" and aren't faking it, do people who do that genuinely think it makes them look cooler? I'm not ragging on them, but I can't help but feel embarrassed about them. And trust me, the difference between talking in ""rap grammar"" and genuinely lacking grammar skills is huge and easy to spot.

A few years ago I watched Alissa Violet's (want to clarify I don't give a rat's ass about YouTube drama or even really know who she is, but a friend sent me a link to that video for this very reason) video about Jake Paul or whoever cheating on her, in which she sits in front of the camera and just made me cringe to hell and back with her ""they be""s and stuff.

If you use a roll of toilet paper a day (which is a bit excessive) and a pack consist of let's just say 25 roles then:

= 100
100/31
=3.225...
 Meaning you can last for more then 3 months or even longer if you use less than 1 a day.

So why are people buying packets upon packets of toilet paper and fighting over it too! If you run out, just jump in the shower!

About a couple-to-three years ago, this user found a celeb-info-site either with 'indian' in the url/title or affiliated with indian/middle-eastern folk, NOT WRITTEN IN their languages, it was in English, but something one might find indian men and women perusing through to find out the names of children and ages and stuff of 'merican celebs.

Had a white-and-magenta color scheme/logo. 'Star' maybe was a part of the title/url and/or 'hollywood'....not necessarily of JUST big-name celebs, but many, many C/D/Z-list clout-chasing self-false-flagger provocateurs/gonzo(yellow/opinion)-journos (glorified loggers), and this user is looking for the age and perhaps middle name of a particular blowhard-prefer-not-to-mention. If one can't find/list this particular site here, am accepting similar ones.

It's NOT celebjihad.

Informationcradle was of little help.

Famousbirthdays was of no help either.

Nope, wasn't celebrityinside either.

Not TBLOP either, not looking for pr0n btw. When 'measurements' were mentioned, it wasn't one of THOSE sites, despite having that as a category in the profile for people.

This website (now that this user remembers more of it) was centered around measurements of people such as female celebrities and their bust size. This site had D-/Z-list online 'e-celebs' and their information like astrological signs too, which is the focus for this user, am trying to uncover something about a non-mainstream celeb, e-celeb. Can't remember the name of this site or these sites though remember using years ago.

Not getting ANY answers elsewhere, so decided to ask here.

It's a gossip/measurement/star sign/etc. rag site assuming based in India with either a focus on or at least inclusion of less-than-well-known/A-list 'celebs' (Z-list internet provocateurs, one of which am trying to find the age of and maybe middle name if applicable). Remember from years ago being on it that it had a white-and-magenta color scheme.

Thanks!

ff0zm8,TheReelMself,What was the name of this website? Not getting help anywhere else!,"...or at least some similar ones.

About a couple-to-three years ago, this user found a celeb-info-site either with 'indian' in the url/title or affiliated with indian/middle-eastern folk, NOT WRITTEN IN their languages, it was in English, but something one might find indian men and women perusing through to find out the names of children and ages and stuff of 'merican celebs.

Had a white-and-magenta color scheme/logo. 'Star' maybe was a part of the title/url and/or 'hollywood'....not necessarily of JUST big-name celebs, but many, many C/D/Z-list clout-chasing self-false-flagger provocateurs/gonzo(yellow/opinion)-journos (glorified loggers), and this user is looking for the age and perhaps middle name of a particular blowhard-prefer-not-to-mention. If one can't find/list this particular site here, am accepting similar ones.

It's NOT celebjihad.

Informationcradle was of little help.

Famousbirthdays was of no help either.

Nope, wasn't celebrityinside either.

Not TBLOP either, not looking for pr0n btw. When 'measurements' were mentioned, it wasn't one of THOSE sites, despite having that as a category in the profile for people.

This website (now that this user remembers more of it) was centered around measurements of people such as female celebrities and their bust size.

One person on the post asked about it in the comments, with only one 'cryptic' reply that has about as many upvotes as the question itself.

I've also seen it in a screenshot of a list of pubs and times that a friend sent me for a pub crawl, he hadn't noticed it and didn't know what it was (a colleague of his has created the list). In his screenshot it was only one of the '2's, whereas in the linked post is all of the '2's on the post

ferb9b,capriciouszephyr,What is up with the run on bottled water? Do people think their sinks will stop working due to covid-19? Or that people are coughing into the water after it has been treated?,"They do add chlorine to sanitize the water. Not the tastiest, but I'd buy soap or food or something first. Also, why tf are people wiping out toilet paper? I had to make sure to buy extra because people are clearing the store out, so I don't run out. I don't know what the purpose of stockpiling either of these things are, but it's annoying. It reminds me of the ""gas scare"" here in San Antonio right after that hurricane hit Houston. I wasn't worried, but when everyone else got worried, I was forced to find gas just because everyone was freaked out, no stations had gas, and I was running on almost empty thinking everyone was dumb. Drove a few miles out of the city, surprise! No gas shortage. I went to pick up a friend from the Houston airport a few days later. All the stations I saw there had gas, no one was freaked out.

One thing I kept seeing over and over in the WRD thread is that r/AgainstHateSubreddits should also be banned because they were supposedly posting child porn, furry porn, and animal mutilation pictures.

I don't visit AHS every day but as a sub about social justice it doesn't really seem like something they would do. And every time someone in WRD asked for evidence of that claim, they received none.

So where did this idea come from? Did someone on AHS actually post that stuff or is it another weird conspiracy from the alt-right corners of Reddit?

Just curious. As to why exactly they were banned. My understanding was that they were probably racist but I couldn’t find much.

Never really followed them so I’m just curious as to why the sub being banned was such a huge deal.

fecn7o,DrixxYBoat,What is with the recent controversy behind Nate Woods execution?,"I'm looking for non biased factual evidence that can actually be used while talking about this issue.

There are dozens of celebrities and black activist who are treating this as if it's a modern day lynching.

However, the people of Reddit have been treating his death like a truly good thing as if we got rid of someone who deserved it.

I'd like an explanation because I can already sense the countless arguments that are going to stem from this situation.

fdvyua,monaflipas,What is going on with Bernie &amp; the billionaires?," 

I just read an [article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-lists/2020-democratic-candidates-issues-policy-positions-820811/) from Rolling Stone and something under Bernie Sanders “Closing the Wealth Gap” section really sparked a \[probably dumb\] question. I rarely follow politics and I do not want this to become a political debate. It could be the way the author wrote the article?

“Sanders is targeting the wealth of America’s oligarchs, and has proposed hiking the estate tax to 77 percent on the fortunes of the very wealthiest, **aiming to raise “$2.2 trillion from the nation’s 588 billionaires,”** **including $74 billion from the Koch brothers alone**. “If the Koch brothers and the billionaire class hate my guts, I welcome their hatred,” Sanders has long said.”

Wouldn’t these Koch brothers and the other \~600 billionaires just move out of America and not get taxed? Is that illegal if they did that? If they did end up actually moving what would the contingency plan be to raise this $2.2trillion under Bernies administration?",871,1583418328,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fdvyua/what_is_going_on_with_bernie_the_billionaires/,OutOfTheLoop,1

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/04/super-tuesday-bernie-sanders-youth-votes-fell-short-compared-2016/4947795002/

I’m guessing I just don’t really understand because I’m out of the loop. Seems to me like voting is just something the people who are actually in control allow us to have to make us feel special. Why should I vote when the electoral college is just going to choose whoever they want anyways?

That’s what they did in 2016 right? Clinton got the popular vote but the electoral college gave it to Trump anyways. 

Why wouldn’t the same thing happen this year? Why should younger voters like me waste our time and effort on a system that make it seem futile.

Moderate democrats clearly don’t want actual change. Elite democrats don’t really have anything to lose if trump does win. Republicans certainly want trump to win. Seems like everything is against the only candidate I actually believe in and inspires me. 

So what’s the point? Seems to me the point of our government is to never actually get things done, only the illusion that things are getting done. Seems like the only time things actually change (usually negatively) is when big money is involved.",15,1583348598,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/fdhve3/whats_the_deal_with_voting_is_it_actually_worth/,OutOfTheLoop,1

Why is testing for the virus so “guarded”? I’m hearing a lot of comments about how the CDC won’t allow testing in people who may be exposed, or even people who they believe is a strong possibility of having the virus. 
I don’t want to assume anything, but I’m having a hard time finding info on why the gov is holding back testing. It just doesn’t make sense to me. 

This is one example that I can find. But I believe this isn’t the only case of this happening so far..

Also it seems only a few posts have been uploaded in the past few days as opposed to 100s before that. And all these posts are literally a title along with a pic of some middle aged dude with bad make up. So I guess somebody is deleting posts aswel

fbr1rp,OddArr,What is the deal with the recent FC Bayern München fan banner?,"From my understanding the fans put up a banner insulting the coach of the opposing team. They labeled him a son of a bitch. 

While I understand that it's a shameful thing to do, I can't wrap my head around two things. First of all, why are there racism debats arousing? How is this related to racism? Second, why was there such a huuuuuge (at least in my perception) overreaction, scandal and aftermath? They start an extensive investigation, the game was interrupted (even nearly cancelled), there has been a ""no offense deal"" (the game was just played to the end without any effort towards scoring) and the officials have to constantly do all sorts of interviews. All this because of a pretty common insult in Germany?! 

I don't know anything about football, but this bugs me. Would appreciate an elaboration. Thanks for reading :)

I've seen a lot of online hype about ""Earth's new moon"", ""about the size of a car"".

Assuming it's entirely of the densest element (Osmium - 22.59g/cm\^3), and it's actually the size of a GO bus (up to 13.72m long, 4.2m tall, 3m wide), this gives us a maximum mass of 4\*10\^6kg. Really, it's going to be way less than that because it's smaller and isn't made entirely out of the densest element.

That's big but that's nothing compared to anything notable - Earth's ""actual"" moon is 7.3\*10\^22kg, Mercury is 3.3\*10\^23kg, Pluto is 1.3\*10\^22kg, Eris is 1.6\*10\^22kg, Ceres is 9.0\*10\^20kg, Europa is 4.8\*10\^22kg, Titan is 1.3\*10\^23kg, this ISS is 4.2\*10\^5kg - I'm sure that's enough examples.

Am I missing something? Does the ""moon"" have water or anything?

fblgkl,itswolfy98,What is the deal with ECNEBI Memes?,"So i was watching meme compilations on youtube and started to come across videos called ECNEBI memes and theres a lot of them they're compilations but I couldn't find anything about what ECNEBI means or what its an acronym for. Any time i search for what it means it just comes up with more compilations and the videos are quite popular and theres a lot of channels that make them and instagram accounts too. I thought it might be a certain type of meme but they just seem like random meme compilations, sometimes they have more dark humor and offensive humor in them than most compilations.
Not sure if my description is very helpful but if you search it on youtube you will find them. Any answers appreciated TIA

Basically,  they all start with a picture of a pretty girl with really nice nails  or makeup or whatever, and then they go on to list ""facts"" which are  usually untrue, ""self-care tips"" which are usually bad, and bits of advice/inspiration which are probably not a good idea to follow.

They're kinda targeted toward my demographic - girls between the ages of 13-18  I'm guessing. Most girls I've talked to, however, think that these posts  are stupid and weird. So I have no idea why they're even successful.

The  most baffling part to me is the pictures. Almost every single thread  I've seen has started with a very dewy photo of a pretty girl, often  coupled with an unrelated ""aesthetic"" pic. I really don't get it.

Over time and specially over the past years I've come to learn that they are pretty... particular.

Recently I saw a video from the [Whang!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrfMvvADRI4) youtube channel about whether or not Taylor Swift was a frequent user of the page.

Someone uploaded a picture of someone who looks quite a lot like her a few times, but her face was never fully visible, and several users came together to try to seemingly doxx the user by identifying patterns in the surroundings of the pictures because... it looked like she was a pretty girl and they wanted to harass her? I don't know.

Other examples are the 4chan-Anonymous assault on the Church of Scientology (also covered by Whang!) and the minor girl they doxxed and tele-harassed into tears and whose father uttered the now infamous ""You done goofed up"". They also tried to doxx the early youtuber Boxxy because... they didn't like her and that's it?

I remember watching Boxxy's videos back then but never knew people tried to doxx her just because they found her irritating.

I'm utterly confused by this mass of people coming together to harass people for trivial reasons.

What's the deal with the page and why do some users participate in this sort of causes?",872,1582746978,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/f9z40y/whats_the_deal_with_4chan_seemingly_frequently/,OutOfTheLoop,1

f9oft7,runex4,Why do people seem to hate Elizabeth Warren?,"So in the Nevada democratic debate https://youtu.be/SQruQL4w0iI

Elizabeth Warren had in my opinion a really strong showing. Not only were her critiques of her fellow debaters spot on but her own platform came off as realistic and more grounded to me than some of the other candidates. I'm aware she made some poor choices regarding her claim of native American blood. 
https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/the-facts-on-elizabeth-warrens-dna-test/
But she doesn't have any actual scandals like Biden 
https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-allegations-women-2020-campaign-2019-6

Bluntly put I think an inaccurate statement regarding hypothetical heritage is incomparable to multiple real life accusations of sexual harassment. Yet I don't hear people ripping Biden up over his sexual harassment allegations; to my knowledge he's been the runner-up behind Bernie this entire primary. 

I'm not a diehard Warren supporter by any means and frankly she does strike me as having thin skin which is something we really don't need right now in a presidential candidate but I just feel like the level of criticism she's receiving is disproportionate.
