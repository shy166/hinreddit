fsobjc,LeoHe,Christmas was coming and Little Johnny’s Mom and Dad took him to the mall to a see Santa Claus," Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said “Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed. I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree. And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”

His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior. We’ve tried everything.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.” The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed. Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard. After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”",0,1585698691,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fsobjc/christmas_was_coming_and_little_johnnys_mom_and/,Jokes,3

On one visit, Hy told me that because of his large donations to charities through the years, the queen wanted to knight him, but he was going to turn it down.

""That's a great honor,"" I said. ""Why would you turn it down?""

""Because during the ceremony you have to say something in Latin,"" he said. ""And I don't wish to bother studying Latin just for that.""

""So say something in Hebrew. The queen wouldn't know the difference.""

""Brilliant,"" Hy complimented me, ""but what should I say?""

Remember that question the son asks the father on the first night of Passover? ... Can you say that in Hebrew?""

""Of course,"" he said. ""Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh.

Thank you, old sport, I shall become a knight.""

At the ceremony Hy waited his turn while several of the other honorees went before the queen. Finally they called his name. He knelt before Her Majesty, she placed her sword on one shoulder and then on the other, and motioned for Hy to speak. Out came ""Ma nishtana ha laila hazeh.""

They eventually find the property of their dreams and make arrangements to buy it, along with with a wide array of farm animals. A few months later, when they are settled in, they decide to invite the local vicar and his wife around for Sunday lunch in an effort to get to know their neighbours. 

Before the meal, John, Sarah, the vicar and his wife were sitting around the kitchen table talking, when the door suddenly flew open and in rushed Jimmy shouting ""mum, dad, the bull is f**cking the cow!"" John and Sarah were horrified and embarrassed that their guests should hear such coarse language. They both apologised profusely to the vicar and his wife and asked if lunch could be postponed to the following Sunday. 

Meanwhile, John and Sarah took Jimmy to one side and said, ""Jimmy, it would have been so much better if you had told us that the bull was 'surprising' the cow instead of using the word you did"".

Next Sunday, just as before, the couple, as well as the vicar and his wife were sitting chatting before lunch, when again the door burst suddenly open and in rushed Jimmy breathlessly announcing ""mum, dad, the bull is surprising all the cows"", ""He can't be surprising all the cows"" said his mother, ""He is mum"" said Jimmy,"" He's f**cking the horse!"".

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between Kumar and his roommate than met the eye. Reading his mom's thoughts, Kumar volunteered, ""I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Sunita and I are just roommates.""

About a week later, Sunita came to Kumar saying, ""Ever since your mother came to dinner, I've been unable to find the silver plate. You don't suppose she took it, do you?"" Kumar said, ""Well, I doubt it, but I'll email her, just to be sure.""

So he sat down and wrote :

\----------------------

*Dear Mother:*

*I'm not saying that you 'did' take the silver plate from my house, I'm not saying that you 'did not' take the silver plate. But the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.*

*Love, Kumar*

\----------------------

Several days later, Kumar received an email from his Mother which reads :

\----------------------

*Dear Son:*

*I'm not saying that you 'do' sleep with Sunita, and I'm not saying that you 'do not' sleep with Sunita. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her OWN bed, she would have found the silver plate by now under the pillow.*

fsfznx,GreatInconsequence,A guy walks into a bar at 4:30 one afternoon.,"He's enjoying his drink and talking with the bartender.  

At 4:57 the bartender looks at the clock and says, ""Damn.  I lost track of the time, I gotta get busy.""  The bartender quickly makes a drink and sets it on the bar.  

Precisely at 5:00 pm, a well-dressed man walks into the bar, grabs the drink and gulps it down.  He leaves a $10 bill on the bar and exits without saying a word.

The guy who came in at 4:30 looks at the bartender and asks, ""What the hell was that all about?""

The bartender explained, ""He's a surgeon, and he comes in every day at 5:00 pm, after his work is through.  He always orders an almond daiquiri, and leaves me a nice tip.  He's done this for so long, I know what to expect.  And he's a buys man, so I don't want to keep him waiting.  I make sure his drink is ready before he comes in.""

The guy seemed impressed by the bartender's efficiency.  He came back the next few days at 4:30, and watched as the bartender made an almond daiquiri for the surgeon.  And every day, the surgeon came in precisely at 5:00 pm, drank the daiquiri, and left without saying a word.

One afternoon, the bartender started to make the drink, but realized he was out of almonds.  ""What am I going to do?"" he asked himself as he searched throughout the bar for almonds.  He found some hickory nuts, and figured that the surgeon wouldn't notice the difference.  So, he mixed up the drink with the hickory nuts, and placed in at the end of the bar.

Sure enough, at 5:00 pm, the surgeon walked into the bar and picked up his drink.  With one sip, he knew something was amiss and he said, ""What's going on?  This isn't my usual drink.""

The bartender said, ""Well, that's a hickory daiquiri, doc.""",8,1585672010,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fsfznx/a_guy_walks_into_a_bar_at_430_one_afternoon/,Jokes,1

fsel1d,d78hue,Putin and Obama meet in Moscow,"They're debating the merits of their respective societies. They argue about moral values and which country is doing better.

Obama: I've heard that all Russian are alcoholics.

Putin: That's a Russophobic myth. I bet there's not a single drunk out in Moscow tonight. 

Obama: I don't believe you. I bet if we take your limo out for a spin I'll see some drunks staggering around. 

Putin: Okay, let me prove you wrong. We'll drive around and if you see a single drunk you can shoot them with my own gun. 

Putin let's the FSB know what they're doing, and tells them to do a sweep and round up every single drunk on their route. He says if Obama sees a single drunk everyone will get sent to Siberia. 

Obama and Putin drive around for 10 minutes, and the streets are empty. Not a single person is out, let alone a drunk. Obama is about to accept defeat when a visibly drunk man staggers out of an apartment building, singing a Russian folk song. Obama leans out the window and shoots him. 

Obama: See Vlad, I saw one person and he was drunk! All Russians are drunks!

Six months later Putin travels to Washington DC and he and Obama are having the same argument about morals and society. Putin suggests they do the same thing they did in Moscow, and he will shoot any drunks that he sees on Washington's streets. Obama let's the Secret Service know to go ahead and make sure there are no drunks anywhere on their route. 

The two presidents drive around for 10 minutes, without seeing anyone. Just as they're turning around a huge group of drunks stumbles out of a bar. Putin gets excited, leans out the window and mows them all down. He teases Obama for the rest of the night. 

Putin: Barack, you said Russians were worse drunks than Americans. I just killed 20 of them, looks like Russia wins again!

No  matter what his frustrated, embarrassed mother does to try to calm him  down, the boy continues to scream furiously and kick the seats around  him.  
 

Suddenly, from the rear of the plane, an elderly  man in the uniform of an Air Force General is seen slowly walking  forward up the aisle. Stopping the flustered mother with an upraised  hand, the white-haired, courtly, soft-spoken General leans down and,  motioning toward his chest, whispers something into the boy's ear.  
 

Instantly, the boy calms down, gently takes his mother's hand, and  quietly fastens his seat belt. All the other passengers burst into  spontaneous applause.  
 

As the General slowly makes his way back to his seat, one of the cabin  attendants touches his sleeve. ""Excuse me, General,"" she asks quietly,  ""but could I ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?""  
 

The old man smiles serenely and gently confides, ""I showed him my  pilot's wings, service stars, and battle ribbons, and explained that  they entitle me to throw one passenger out the plane door on any flight I choose.",2,1585661375,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fscx9u/as_a_crowded_airliner_is_about_to_take_off/,Jokes,1

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having
sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

fsb8v7,HeinzKetchupMayo,"A horse is watching the music channel,","He's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says ""that looks amazing, I want to do that!""
The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar."" Says the horse.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the horse. ""I'm a horse.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.
""Hey Chicken, come over!"" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says ""hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that.""
Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums."" Says the chicken.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the chicken. ""I'm a chicken.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.
Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. ""Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar."" Says the cow.
""Sure,"" says the man on the phone. ""Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started.""
""There's just one problem,"" says the cow. ""I'm a cow.""
""Not to worry,"" the man says. ""We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time.""
Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.
One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says ""hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!""
The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.
Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.
Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.
So the horse walks into a bar.
The bartender asks, ""why the long face?""",2,1585653933,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fsb8v7/a_horse_is_watching_the_music_channel/,Jokes,1

fs8ivz,VPee,Engineers take a bow!,"During the development of a new jet fighter aircraft the wings on the prototypes kept snapping off where they joined the fuselage. The test-pilots who only barely survived by ejecting in time were terrified. No amount of re-design seem to solve the problem, so the aircraft company in desperation offered its employees a huge reward to come up with diagnoses. To the surprise of the top engineers, old Jenkins the janitor meekly said he had an idea. Well, desperation breeds opportunities, so they asked him to explain. In reply he merely requested a power drill, and when supplied one he climbed onto the wings of the latest prototype and proceeded to make holes a few inches apart where the wings joined the fuselage. ""Now, get your test pilot to fly the fighter"", Jenkins advised. Sceptical, but curious, the engineers did. Lo! The jet fighter passed with flying (pun intended) colors. No more wing snapping. Amazed, the engineers surrounded Jenkins amidst all the celebration and asked him how he had hit upon such a clever solution that evaded all the engineering brains. Here is Jenkins' response.

fs7i67,shadowlarx,There’s an unusual hospital,"where one of the treatments involves the female nurses taking the male patients home and sleeping with them.

For most of the patients, the treatment is very effective. But one day, into the hospital comes an odd patient who has the word “Shorty” tattooed on his penis. None of the nurses want anything to do with him.

Days go by and the poor man’s health doesn’t improve. So finally, this one nurse feels sorry for him and brings him home.

When she comes in the next morning, she is smiling and happy. The other nurses ask, “Why are you so happy? Weren’t you with the guy who has ‘Shorty’ tattooed on his penis?”

“Yes,” she says, “but when he became aroused, it said ‘Shorty’s Restaurant and Pizzeria.’”

A suspected Covid-19 male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose. A young student female nurse appears and gives him a partial sponge bath. 
""Nurse,""' he mumbles from behind the mask, ""are my testicles black?""
Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, ""I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet.""
He struggles to ask again, ""Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?""
Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and
pulls back the covers.
She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.
She looks very closely and says, ""There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine.""
The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly,

fs676t,coinstored,So a politician dies...,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician...""
""Well, yes, is that a problem?""
""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"" 

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician.
""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...

And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini.
""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!""
""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks.
Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside...""
Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course.
""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question.
So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...

And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?""
""No sir!"" says the man.
""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"".
""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician.
""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.
""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

""Ah"", says Satan. ""You see, yesterday, we were campaigning. But today, you voted...""",23,1585628110,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fs676t/so_a_politician_dies/,Jokes,1

Embarrassed, the young nurse replies, ""I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet.""
He struggles to ask again, ""Nurse, please check for me. Are my testicles black?""
Concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and
pulls back the covers.
She raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles gently in the other.
She looks very closely and says, ""There's nothing wrong with them, Sir. They look fine.""
The man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says very slowly,

""Well,"" replied the Queen, ""the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people.""

Trump frowned, and then asked, ""But how do I know the people around you are really intelligent?""

The Queen took a sip of tea. ""Oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle.""

The Queen pushed a button on her intercom. ""Please send Boris Johnson in here, would you?""

The Prime Minster walked into the room and said, ""Yes, Your Majesty?""

The Queen smiled and said, ""Answer me this, if you would, Boris. Your mother and father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister. Who is it?""

Without pausing for a moment, he answered, ""That would be me.""

""Yes! Very good,"" said the Queen.

Trump went back home to ask Mike Pence the same question. “ Mike, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child. It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?""

""I'm not sure,"" said Pence. ""Let me get back to you on that one."" He went to his advisers and asked everyone, but none could give him an answer.

Finally, Pence ran in to his friend Jack Murphy in a restaurant the next night. Pence asked, ""Jack, can you answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. Who is it?""

Jack Murphy answered right back, ""That's easy, it's me!""

Pence smiled, and said, ""Thanks!""

Pence then went back to speak with Trump. ""Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that riddle: It's my friend Jack Murphy!""

she and Roger should have separate bedrooms, because she is concerned
that her new but aged husband may over-exert himself if they spend the
entire night together.

After the wedding festivities Jenny prepares herself for bed and the
expected knock on the door.

Sure enough the knock comes, the door opens and there is Roger, her 85
year old groom, ready for action. They unite as one.

All goes well, Roger takes leave of his bride, and she prepares to go to
sleep.

After a few minutes, Jenny hears another knock on her bedroom door, and
it's Roger,

Again he is ready for more 'action'. Somewhat surprised, Jenny consents
for more coupling.

When the newlyweds are done, Roger kisses his bride, bids her a fond
good night and leaves.

She is set to go to sleep again, but, aha, you guessed it - Roger is
back again, rapping on the door and is as fresh as a 25-year-old, ready
for more 'action'.

And, once more they enjoy each other.

But as Roger gets set to leave again, his young bride says to him, 'I am
thoroughly impressed that at your age you can perform so well and so
often. I have been with guys less than a third of your age who were only
good once. You are truly a great lover, Roger.'

Roger, somewhat embarrassed, turns to Jenny and says: 'You mean I was
here already?'",4,1585616903,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fs3esh/roger_85_married_jenny_a_lovely_25_year_old/,Jokes,1

They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and she gasps and runs away! Seeing this, the madam sends over a more experienced lady to entertain the gentleman.

They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear, and she too screams, ""No!"" and walks quickly away.

The madam is surprised that this ordinary looking man has asked for something so outrageous that her two girls will have nothing to do with him. She decides that only her most experienced lady, Lola, will do. Lola has never said no, and it's not likely anything would surprise her. So the madam sends her over to Geoffrey's. They sit and talk, frolic a little, giggle a bit, drink a bit, and she sits on his lap. He whispers in her ear and she screams, ""NO WAY, BUDDY!"" and smacks him as hard as she can and leaves.

Madam is by now absolutely intrigued, having seen nothing like this in all her years of operating a brothel. She hasn't done the bedroom work herself for a long time, but she's sure she has said yes to everything a man could possibly ask for. She just has to find out what this man wants that has made her girls so angry. Besides she sees a chance to teach her employees a lesson.

So she goes over to Geoffrey and says that she's the best in the house and is available. She sits and talks with him. They frolic, giggle, drink and then she sits in his lap.

He leans forwards and whispers in her ear, ""Can I pay in Pounds?""",3,1585615887,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fs359e/a_british_tourist_visits_a_brothel_in_germany/,Jokes,1

The next day, as he was walking along the street, he spotted a man with a big, bushy, mustache. The boy remembered what his mother said yesterday. He approached him, took out his gun, and shot him in the forehead, killing him. The boy, panicked and anxious, ran away to his home as fast as he could, while the victim's skull was bleeding. He had not yet told his mother of what happened as he returned home.

The next day, at early morning, sirens were roaring outside the house. The boy and his mother immediately woke up. Loud knocks were sent through the door. 'Police! This family has 10 seconds to leave the premises right now, or the door will be opened by brute force.' As the policeman started counting down, the young boy reluctantly told his mother of what happened yesterday. 'I shot a man, like you told me to.' His mother feeling both proud and panicked, told him--'Quick! Hide under my skirt, I will talk to the police.' 'I'm coming out!' Said the mother, moving slowly so that her son can move along with her. As she was opening the door, the boy looked up and said -'Mommy! There is a big, bushy, mustache under here too?'.

A few days later there's a knock at the door and the priest answers only to discover a  man standing there with no arms. ""Can I help you?"" the priest asks, to which the man replies that he is there to apply for the job. ""I don't want to be insensitive"", the priest exclaims, ""but I don't see how you can fulfil the requirements of the job?"". The man pleads with the priest to give him a chance and the priest decides to acquiesce only to convince him that it's a waste of time. When they get to the top of the tower the priest points to the large bell and says ""Well there it is!"", but before he can finish the sentence the man starts running straight at it and strikes it face first. The shocked priest shouts ""No!! What are you doing?"", but again the man runs the length of the bell tower headfirst into the bell, which is starting to sway back and forth. the priest yells ""Stop, please, no more"" but the guy is already running full speed at the bell and again strikes it headfirst. By now the bell is really rocking back and forth and starting to ring. The priest pleads with the man who is now bruised and bloodied, ""For the Love of God, no more"", but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the guy sprints across the tower at the swinging bell. Unfortunately, he mistimes it misses the bell entirely and flies off the edge of the bell tower. The priest screams and rushes down the stairs to help the guy. When he gets to the bottom he sees a crowd of people gathered around and pushes his way thru to the bruised and battered body. Someone says ""Father do you know this man?"", and the priest answers""No, but his face rings a bell!""",2,1585606787,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fs0mfl/my_favorite_clean_joke/,Jokes,1

frxfqr,abhiswin,Finding Jesus,"A man is stumbling through the woods, totally drunk, when he comes upon a Preacher baptizing people in the river. He proceeds to walk into the water And subsequently bumps into the preacher.

 The preacher turns around and is Almost overcome by the smell of booze. But, he still manages to ask the Drunk, ""Are you ready to find Jesus?"" 

The drunk answers, ""Yes,I am ."" 

So the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the water. He pulls him up and Asks the drunk, ""Brother have you found Jesus?"" 

The drunk replies, ""No, I haven't found Jesus."" 

The preacher, shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again but for A little longer this time. He again pulls him out of the water and asks Again, ""Have you found Jesus, my brother?"" 

The drunk again answers, ""No, I haven't found Jesus."" 

By this time, the preacher is at his wits end so he dunks the drunk in the Water again --- but this time he holds him down for about 30 seconds. 

  


When the drunk begins kicking his arms and legs, the preacher pulls him up. The preacher asked the drunk again, ""For the love of God, have you found Jesus?"" 

  


The drunk wipes his eyes and catches his breath and says to the preacher, ""Are you sure this is where he fell in ?""",7,1585596591,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frxfqr/finding_jesus/,Jokes,1
frxeww,Sgt_DubKing,Raunchiest joke I told when I was younger (NSFW),"A beautiful woman approaches a man at a bar and offers him a proposition ""For $200 I bet I can suck your dick and sing the national anthem at the same time."" The man figures he can get some head and actually get paid for it, so he obliges. The woman takes him into the closet, starts sucking, and sure enough starts singing the national anthem at the same time. The man pays his $200 and walks away slightly confused, but very relaxed. 

The next night, the same woman comes into the bar and propositions another man. ""For $200 I bet I can suck your dick and sing the national anthem at the same time."" She brings him to the closet, performs her amazing feat, and collects her money from the flabbergasted stranger.

The next night, the same woman comes into the bar and propositions the same man from the 1st night (having forgotten she had already ""conned"" this particular gentleman.) ""For $200 I bet I can suck your dick and sing the national anthem at the same time."" Being somewhat wiser, the man agrees, but asks to go to his car briefly before she starts. He grabs the small flashlight out of his glovebox, so that THIS time, he can see what the promiscuous woman is doing to accomplish this amazing trick.

She takes him into the closet, and begins to suck his dick and sing the national anthem.  Just as she started the part about ramparts, the man clicks on the flashlight and there he sees a glass eye-ball rolling around on the table.",13,1585596514,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frxeww/raunchiest_joke_i_told_when_i_was_younger_nsfw/,Jokes,1

Little Johnny is watching this from the back of the class, clearly bothered. ""No, no, no..."" he says as he raises his hand.

Johnny begins, ""Well, for starters, birds don't fall off of wires...""

""Ok..."" the teacher starts when Johnny forges ahead.

""If it fell off, then it was probably shot, and if it was shot then the other birds would have flown away.""

""So the correct answer is zero birds."" he finishes.

The teacher replies, ""Well Johnny, that makes a lot of sense, I like the way you think!""

'Then I shall fly on,' answered the student with a smile.

The teacher was clearly vexed by the cheeky reply and decided to make sure to do everything in his power to fail the student at the exams.

At the oral exam, he gave the student the hardest questions, but the student had amazing answers for everything. Therefore, hoping he could still fail his victim, the teacher asked him a trickier question:

'You're walking on a road and you find two bags. One contains gold, the other cleverness. Which bag do you choose?'

'The gold.'

'Unfortunately, I don't agree. I'd choose cleverness, because that's more important than money.'

'Everyone would choose what they don't have,' says the student.

The teacher turns red, and he's so angry he writes ""ass"" on the student's paper. The student leaves without looking at the paper. However, he returns shortly, gives back his paper and says:

'Excuse me sir, you did sign my paper, but you forgot to give my grade!'",8,1585586876,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frubv5/a_university_student_wanted_to_sit_next_to_one_of/,Jokes,1

frtjex,hrt8881,Socrates the philosopher . . .,"Keep this in mind the next time you are about to repeat a rumor or spread gossip. 

In ancient Greece (469 - 399 BC), Socrates was widely lauded for his wisdom. One day an acquaintance ran up to him excitedly and said, ""Socrates, do you know what I just heard about Diogenes?""

""Wait a moment,"" Socrates replied, ""Before you tell me, I'd like you to pass a little test. It's called the Triple Filter Test.""

""Triple filter?"" asked the acquaintance.

""That's right,"" Socrates continued, ""Before you talk to me about Diogenes let's take a moment to filter what you're going to say. The first filter is Truth. Have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true?""

""No,"" the man said, ""Actually I just heard about it.""

""All right,"" said Socrates, ""So you don't really know if it's true or not. Now let's try the second filter, the filter of Goodness. Is what you are about to tell me about Diogenes something good?""

""No, on the contrary...""

""So,"" Socrates continued, ""You want to tell me something about Diogenes that may be bad, even though you're not certain it's true?""

The man shrugged, a little embarrassed. Socrates continued, ""You may still pass the test though, because there is a third filter, the filter of Usefulness. Is what you want to tell me about Diogenes going to be useful to me?""

""No, not really.""

""Well,"" concluded Socrates, ""If what you want to tell me is neither True nor Good nor even Useful, why tell it to me or anyone at all?""

The man was bewildered and ashamed. This is an example of why Socrates was a great philosopher and held in such high esteem.

It also explains why Socrates never found out that Diogenes was banging his wife.",5,1585584362,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frtjex/socrates_the_philosopher/,Jokes,1

Since this criminal was known to have pulled off such fantastic heists before, it was no doubt that he would eventually successfully achieve this goal, which meant that the police station was on high alert for the criminal. The police didn't know who this criminal was, but they had a few clues: he spoke spanish, a language not well known throughout the city, and he also had a knack for disguises and false identities, which meant he could be anyone, and the police has not been stopping to figure out who he is.

""But, fortunately, we managed to get his identity, and we caught the damn bastard last night!"" the police interrogator exclaimed in the interrogation room, infront of the criminal. ""*Un*fortunately, he's already managed to steal the money, and has hidden it somewhere safe, and I want him to tell me where that is. Except I don't speak spanish, and nor does anyone in this damn building, so that's why we need YOU, the translator,"" he points to the other man in the room, ""to get him to tell us where he hid it. Let's start.""

The interrogator spoke first. ""Ask him, where does he keep the money?""
The translator asked the criminal, and he spoke back in unfamiliar words. ""He says he will not tell,"" said the translator.
The interrogator said, ""Tell him to speak up, or we will put him to death sentence for his crimes.""
The translator spoke accordingly, and the criminal seemed so visibly frightened by this, that he immediately told him its location. ""By the old graveyard, under the second tree from the entrance! There's the money bags!"" he said in Spanish.

We are here to take care of your needs, so we will call you the People.

The husband leaves the room and not too lo NV after, his wife gives birth to a baby girl. She named the baby “Love.” The man didn’t think much of this other than the fact it was a weird name.

Years had past and the daughter came home from school crying. So her father asked 

“Baby what’s wrong?”

She told her dad that she was getting bullied because of her weird name. Her father told her that it was going to be okay. She went up to her room and kept crying.

A few years later and the name thing happened. The girl, Love, came home from school crying only for her dad to ask why. She said it was from her name.

Years later and Love was in her senior year of high school. She came home one day crying as usual and when her dad asked why, she said it was from her name. She kissed him on the cheek and went upstairs to her room to cry. The man thought this was weird because she hadn’t done this since she was a really little girl. So he talked to his wife about it and they agreed to go upstairs to check on her. They went upstairs and knocked on her door.
There was no reply.
They opened the door and Love wasn’t there. Suddenly, there was a gunshot. The parents were worried their daughter had killed herself. So they turn around and find that she is standing behind them with a gun pointed at her dad. The man looks down at his chest and sees that there is blood coming out. He looks at his wife and says

“Shot through the heart! And you’re to blame, darling you gave love a bad name!”",1,1585569756,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frpj14/a_man_and_his_pregnant_wife/,Jokes,1

So, he goes all the way downtown to the tux store and when he opens the door there's a huge long tux line. Apparently everyone in town waited until the last possible minute to rent a tux, which shouldn't be that surprising for a 17 year old boy.

So he waits and he waits and he waits and finally he gets his tux when he over hears two boys talking about their dates and he thinks ""Shit! I need to get a corsage.""

So Billy heads on down to the florist and of course there is a huge long corsage line. This too, of course shouldn't be surprising as flowers will die and you don't want to buy them too early. He waits and waits and finally he has his flowers. When he's leaving the shop he overhears two ladies looking at flowers and talking about wedding transportation and Billy groans and thinks ""I need a limo.""

Wouldn't you know it, prom season is prime wedding season as well, and when he gets to the rental agency theres a huge long limo line. Billy spends even longer waiting in the limo line than the other shops, it's nearly dark when he finally gets his limo.

Billy is relieved to finally have everything he needs for the prom and phones his girlfriend Penny to tell her the good news. Penny asks ""Did you get the prom tickets?"" Billy starts to panic when Penny laughs and told him she got them a week ago and scolds him for waiting so long to reserve everything.

The night of the prom arrives and when Billy and Penny get to the prom theres a huge long prom line to get in, because of course in this day and age they need to search the prom goers for drugs and alcohol and weapons. Billy submits to a pat down and goes into the prom.

Penny says lets go dance for a bit, and after some hard core boogying, Penny suggests they eat. Billy agrees and follows her to the buffet table where there's a huge long buffet line. So they wait and they wait getting hungrier and more impatient until they are finally laden with food and make there way to their table.

They had just begun to eat when Penny realizes she forgot drinks, to which Billy insists upon getting for the both of them.

frp0a7,international-mf,The Tale of Prince Hishun,"Tall, brave, and handsome, Prince Hishun was the darling of the nation, much to the envy of its male inhabitants. Parades through the city would be greeted with no food for the evening, as the women all made it a point to follow the Prince to every corner of his journey. He was forever courted by a seemingly unlimited amount of lucky women, and his golden locks were a joy to behold. For a long time it seemed that the Prince was the perfect man, warrior, and would-be-husband.

That was, until, a group of English marauders decided to do something about it.

‘I’m sick of the little brat,’ said Dicky Dave, their one-eyed leader after an entire month of pillaging the countryside. ‘Let’s give him a good farewell for all he’s done to us.’

Prince Hishun had made all attempts to ensure the safety of his subjects, and in doing so had armed several villages with crossbows which had made the job of the marauders quite difficult indeed.

‘I agree,’ said the second-in-command, the huge goon called Horr. ‘We will strike vengeance upon the pretty-boy’s wrathful body.’

The group quickly made plans to assemble near the castle at midnight three weeks from then, and decided that they would invade from within the secret tunnels under the castle that few knew about—being marauders, they had accidentally discovered them while laying siege to a nearby village.

Two weeks later, the marauders disguised themselves as travellers from the far east and arrived at the Raider’s Folly, the inn closest to the city centre. They ensured a great deal of fanfare around their arrival, for they knew that the more outrageous the story the less attention it would call for. Who ever left the travellers along? No, the men to be suspicious about were the ones in dark cloaks in the corners of bars.

For about a week the marauders told tall tales of tamed dragons and cities of gold, then retired early the night before the grand heist. They were evidently men of culture—no one paid them a second thought.

Then, at midnight, the marauders emerged.

Arming themselves with all manner of weapons, they ran on foot through the empty streets and didn’t look back until they reached the nearest village. There was an old mound hidden in the wilderness—except they knew that it wasn’t a mound but a cleverly concealed tunnel. It was wide enough to fit two and tall enough to fit half. The marauders lit their torches.

Fifteen minutes hence, the marauders arrived at the dungeons.

‘Make no sound,’ warned Dave before they entered.

Tiptoes in the darkness. There was something unruly about the cold there, but on one must go. Stairs. They rose through the crying and the pitter-patter of the faucets until they saw a regal carpet.

‘Split,’ whispered Dave.

And they did. So they were in the castle, but none knew where Hishun lived… door by door, they swept around until they could find the prince.

But an hour passed. Then another. Where was the man?

At this point Horr had had enough. He decided to let out a great bellow to warn his coming and draw the guards, and perhaps with it the prince. After all, a small chance was greater than none, wasn’t it? The final door, he told himself, One more and then he’ll come calling.

With a delicacy unexpected of his great size, he undid the latch with his pocket knife, and opened the door to see—Hishun.

Hishun, there by the windowsill! Hishun, awake as day!

Before thinking, Horr charged.

‘Aargh!’ he screamed, holding his sword above his head. But the prince was faster. Before he knew it, the prince had grabbed his own weapon, and the crude iron was no match for the Prince’s finely carved steel. His sword chipped. But Horr did not give in. Again and again he hacked, for the prince was unarmored, but each time he was blocked by the beautiful movements befitting a dancer. But the iron must always give in. With a final blow, Horr’s sword cleaved in two with such a force that the Prince’s sword flew out of his arms.

Now the prince was unarmed. And Horr was the larger man.

Finally frightened, Prince Hishun grabbed the nearest object he could find—the frying pan in which his mother had brought him an omelette in the morning. He waved with as much power as he could muster, and, with a clank, the metal tore through the old breastplate straight into Horr’s side.

The injury was enough for Horr. He now saw the prince as a great demon, a power that God himself had sworn to protect. He pulled himself up and sprinted. Down through the stairs, straight through the dungeon, crawling through the tunnel. When he came out, he saw the other marauders. Then he gave way.

Another week passed and Horr recovered enough to be able to finally carry out a conversation. He saw the tattered remains of his breastplate, and the frying pan sticking embedded into the side. He tried to pull it apart. Nothing happened.

‘A merry adventure you had,’ said one of the other marauders. ‘Which guard did you find yourself battling with? Pray, tell us who could fight the mighty Horr with nothing but a frypan.’

‘T’was no guard I met that night,’ said Horr. ‘It was the prince who struck me.’

The marauders looked at each other, then burst out laughing. ‘Really? Then where are the rumors and tales of Hishun battling an unknown enemy in the middle of the night? We haven’t heard a single tale since then.’

Horr looked at them incredulously. ‘What do you mean? I saw the Prince! I battled with him in the midst of the night, I fought him within his own room!’

‘Tall tales,’ said Dave. ‘We shall make another attempt in a fortnight. And Horr can stay behind if he wishes.’ They laughed merrily.

‘I’m telling the truth! It was the prince!’

‘And my mother’s the queen,’ said Dave, and they laughed even louder.

Frustrated, Horr picked up the battered breastplate, looked up to the sky and bellowed:

&gt;!‘No one accepts this pan is in ‘cause Hishun!’!&lt;",7,1585567427,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frp0a7/the_tale_of_prince_hishun/,Jokes,1

The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.

He tells the pharmacist it’s his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he’d like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.

That night, the boy shows up at the girl’s parents house and his girlfriend meets him at the door.

“Oh, I’m so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!” she says.

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl’s parents are already seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.

10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.

Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and Whispers to the boyfriend, “I had no idea you were this religious.”

The boy turns, and whispers back, “I had no idea your father was a Pharmacist.”",51,1585552204,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frm5ox/a_girl_asks_her_boyfriend_to_come_over_friday/,Jokes,1

frm4it,twainco,So drunk he can't stand up,"An Irishman's been drinking at a pub all night. When he stands up to leave, he falls flat on his face. He tries to stand one more time, but to no avail. Again, he falls flat on his face. He figures he'll crawl outside and get some fresh air and maybe that will sober him up. Once outside, he stands up and, sure enough, he falls flat on his face. The Irishman decides to crawl the four blocks to his home.

When he arrives at the door, he stands up and falls flat on his face. He crawls through the door into his bedroom. When he reaches his bed, he tries one more time to stand up. This time, he manages to pull himself upright but he quickly falls right into bed. He is sound asleep as soon as his head hits the pillow.

He awakens the next morning to his wife standing over him, shouting, ""So, you've been out drinking again!""

""Why do you say that?"" he asks innocently.

""The pub called. You left your wheelchair there again.""

The devil asks them, ""What are you doing? Isn't it hot enough for you?""

The two guys reply, ""Well, you know, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy for a chance to warm up a bit, you know.""

The devil decides that these two aren't miserable enough and turns up the heat. The next morning, he stops by again and there they are, still dressed in their parkas, mittens and hats.
The devil asks them again, ""It's awfully hot down here, can't you guys feel that?""

Again, the guys reply, ""Well, like we told you yesterday, we're from Michigan, the land of ice and snow and cold. We're just happy to warm up a little bit, you know.""

The devil gets a little steamed up and he decides to fix the two guys. He cranks the heat up as high as it will go. The people are wailing and screaming everywhere. He stops by the room with the two guys from Michigan and finds them in light jackets and hats, grilling sausage and drinking beer. The devil is astonished. ""Everyone down here is in abject misery, and you seem to be enjoying yourselves.""

The two Michiganders reply, ""Well, ya know, we don't get too much warm weather up there in Michigan, we've just got to have a cookout when the weather is this nice.""

The devil is absolutely furious, he can hardly see straight. Finally, he comes up with an answer. These two love the heat because they have been cold all their lives. He decides to turn all the heat in hell off.

The next morning, the temperature is below zero, icicles are hanging everywhere, the people are shivering so bad, they are unable to wail, moan or gnash their teeth.
The devil smiles and heads for the room with the 2 Michiganders. He finds them back in their parkas, mittens and hats. They are jumping up and down and cheering.
The devil was dumbfounded. ""I don't understand. When I turn the heat up, you're happy. Now it's freezing cold, and you're happy. What is wrong with you two?""

Husband #4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.

Husband #5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.

Husband #6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.

Husband #7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.

Husband #8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.

frdqly,breadathy,A classic Canadian Joke.,"A Mainlander is driving down the highway and runs over a rabbit. Wondering what noise was, he stops his car and gets out to look. While he's standing there a newfie pulls up and asks him what's going on.

The mainlander says, ""I'm just here visiting your fair province and I seem to have killed one of your animals.""

The newfie takes a look at the rabbit and says, 
""No problem, by’s. Hang'er down a few.""

The newfie then goes to his truck and gets an aerosol spray-can, which he proceeds to empty onto the rabbit. When he's done he chucks the empty and says, ""There ya go, me son. Enjoy yer stay"" then gets in his truck and takes off.

The rabbit gets up, hops 10 feet towards the woods, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, turns around and waves, hops another 10 feet, and finally disappears into the woods.

The Mainlander is blown away. Wondering what the newfie did, he grabs the can out of the ditch and reads the label, which says: ""Hair spray. Gauranteed to bring dead hair back to life with a permanent wave""",2,1585517453,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frdqly/a_classic_canadian_joke/,Jokes,6

frd5jg,QuasarIR,Area 51 Gaurds V.S. Wife,"You’ve all heard of the Air Force’s ultra-high-security, super-secret  base in Nevada, known simply as “Area 51?” Well, late one afternoon, the  Air Force folks out at Area 51 were very surprised to see a Cessna  landing at their “secret” base. They immediately impounded the aircraft  and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room. The pilot’s story was  that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and spotted the Base just as he  was about to run out of fuel. The Air Force started a full FBI  background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the  investigation.  
 By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was  lost and wasn’t a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying “you-did-not-see-a-base” briefing, complete with threats of  spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was that-a-way  on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.  
 The day after that though, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the  same Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP’s surrounded the plane…  only this time there were two people in the plane. The same pilot jumped  out and said, “Do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane  and you have to tell her where I was last night!”",0,1585515407,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/frd5jg/area_51_gaurds_vs_wife/,Jokes,5

At the beginning it was hard, but as time passed, this guy learnt how to provide food and shelter, he started taking care of her, and eventually she started caring about him... after all, there wasnt anybody else in the island...

He eventually built a cabin, had a functioning automatic potable water supply, and all sorts of little clever commodities, all done to make her life easier... it was the most effort any man had ever done for her, and all the hard work made him fit, she noticed this...

One night after some wildlife attacked and he defended her succesfully, getting a few cuts in the process, she threw herself at him and they made love, after that, they where for all intents and purposes a couple with an above regular sex life.

But for some reason he started drifting away, something was bothering him. And she noticed... ""Whats wrong?"" Scarlett Johansson asked, ""Nothing..."" the guy would say...

She pestered him for a while eventually saying she would do ANYTHING he needed or wanted to make him feel good again, just because she really cared for him a lot, and even if he wasnt asking, she felt it was the least she owed it to him...

    ""Really?, youll do anything id like?""

    ""yes"" she said ""anything!""

    ""ok, first i want you to take off you toga and get into this pair of work jeans that somehow washed on the shore""

    ""ok...""

    ""now put this shirt on please, but first, ""tape"" your boobs so they are flat""

    ""wha... ok, id say id do anything"" she said lovingly.

    ""ok, now, take this hat and wear it, but tuck your hair under it""

she was kinda confused, but non the less, she wanted to make him happy, so she tuck her hair under the hat.

    ""Now id like for you to grab this piece of soot and paint yourself a beard and a mustache""

    ""ok... if this is what you want..."" she muttered.

    ""now, please, put on these sunglasses, and start walking down the beach ill catch up to you in a bit"" he said a bit excited...

The couple had no choice but to own up to their mistake. Upon reaching the entrance of the mansion, they took awhile to discover the door was unlocked. To their dismay, behind the smashed window was also a broken vase.

The couple heard noises behind them and they whirled around to see an old man, looking to be in his 60s, gazing at them cheerfully (to their surprise). He spoke.

""Ahh... so you two were the ones who freed me from captivity! I am a genie who has been trapped in the vase for centuries, and to express my gratitude, I would like to grant any 3 wishes of your choice.""

The husband, without thinking twice, jumped at the opportunity. 

""If there are no limits to the 3 wishes, I would want an endless amount of money to spend, be able to own big houses and cars, and be the supreme ruler of the entire world where everyone has to obey me."" 

To which the genie replied, ""I shall grant your wish in 1 week. But on only 1 condition: you must let me fuck your wife whenever and however I want during this period of time."" 

The wife was uncomfortable but the husband relented, telling her it would all be worth it when the 1 week was over. 

On the 7th day, the genie met the husband for breakfast, wanting to go over the 3 wishes again. They started to have casual conversation. 

The genie asked the husband, ""So how long have the two of you been married?""

The husband replied, ""We have been married for almost 30 years. I am reaching the age of 50 soon and dearly hope that the 3 wishes would bring us alot of comfort in old age together.""

Assuming that the mom was one of those anti-vaxxers, he prepares a number of pro-vaccination pamphlets to prepare to convince her to the benefits of vaccination.

The mom says, ""I don't need pro-vaccination pamphlets. I'm 100% pro-vaccination.""

Relieved, the doctor said: ""Well, then I'll administer the vaccines right away.""

However, the mom said: ""No need. The kid is already vaccinated.""

The doctor said: ""No, I assure you that according to official records, your kid is most certainly not vaccinated. Do you have any documents proving the child is vaccinated?""

The mom said: ""Yes, the proof is that my child is alive.""

The doctor was like: ""Pardon me?""

The mom explains: ""Vaccines saves lives, and children without vaccines die. It is hard, scientific fact that no child can survive without vaccination, so the fact my child is alive proves he is vaccinated.""

The doctor said: ""I'm sorry, but you must have heard some misinformation. Vaccines greatly increase a child's survival rate, but child could survive without vaccines. A child being alive is not proof that he or she is vaccinated.""

The mom was shocked: ""I can't believe they would let an ANTI-VAXXER be a doctor! You're one of those idiots that believe children could survive without vaccines? What do you take me for, and idiot? You are the reason all these children don't get vaccinated. Not only should you lose your license, you should go to jail.""

The doctor said: ""No, ma'am. I'm very pro-vaccination. I've performed thousands of vaccinations just last year. I'm just sticking to the facts. You need to get your child vaccinated.""

The mom screamed: ""We have an anti-vax doctor in the house! He's trying to convince me that children can survive without vaccines!!""

The entire hospital went up in arms. What? An anti-vaxxer doctor working in the hospital spreading misinformation?

The entire hospital chanted: ""Throw him out! Throw him out!""

After they threw out the doctor and everyone who supported him, the hospital thanked the mother for her service in helping spreading the benefits of vaccination.

""Remember, vaccination saves lives."" Said the mother. ""But we have much work to do. We must inform everyone that children couldn't survive without vaccines. The problem is much bigger than us.""

Pondering about how to spread the message, someone gets an idea.

fr6klk,bigkurry445,Three kingdoms border a lake in the shape of an obtuse triangle,"One kingdom lies on each side of the lake. For decades, the king's had argued over it's true owner, each claiming to be the first kingdom to settle there, and many tales of magical swords and godly favours to claim divine right. Eventually, this storytelling and legal battling came to no conclusion, so the kings decided to go to war.

The first kingdom is very wealthy, and has a grand army of thousands of Knights in shining armour with state of the art squires and weaponry, expertly trained killing machines.

The second kingdom is moderately well off, and has several hundred Knights in standard armour with enough squires to get by, but all willing in heart and mind.

The third kingdom is very poor, and has only one elderly Knight with his great grandson for a squire, in rusty centuries old armour.

On the eve before the battle, each kingdom decides to have a celebration for the great deeds that are about to be done.

The first kingdom has a great banquet that no words can give justice to, a massive, endless hall of food and delight, dancers and jesters and bards as plentiful as the fine wine and boar that accompanies them.

The second kingdom has not nearly as grand an occasion, but makes the most of what they have, making up for the lack of fine food and entertainment with enough ale to knock out an elephant.

The third kingdom has but scraps to make do with. In fact, so little food do they have that there is only enough for the Knight and boy squire alone to have a feast (a feast by their standards, at least). The elderly Knight is too weak and tired to get up, so the squire prepares the meal. He decides to cook a stew, so hangs a pot over a fire with a noose and cooks what they have into a small broth.

Finally, the great day dawns. The kings did not sleep through the night, and sent their generals to ready their armies. The world sat on tenterhooks.

However, fate had taken a strange turn. The armies from the first and second kingdoms had drunk so much in their revels that not one remained conscious, much to the fury of their leaders. And in the third kingdom, the elderly Knight's back had perished due to old age. The kings were left speechless. There was only one option.

The squires must go to war.

So on the battlefield, a hundred thousand squires in tunics too big for them and wooden swords trampled the ground beneath them as they came to the edge. One gigantic behemoth of an army met the other small but willing force at the peak of the lake.

And the squire of the third kingdom faced them all.

The battle began. Heads were clubbed in, backs broken, knees twisted, hair pulled, and slowly the numbers remaining dwindled. As the hours swept by and the body piles grew high, the kings and their people watched in the greatest suspense the lake ever knew.

And as the sun set, and the dust cleared, finally, a single figure stood atop the mountain of bodies beneath him, victorious. The squire of the third kingdom had won.

This goes to show that the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is greater than the sum of the squires of the other two sides of the triangle.",8,1585491633,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fr6klk/three_kingdoms_border_a_lake_in_the_shape_of_an/,Jokes,1

fr6cid,blitzsj,Two little boys stole a big bag of oranges from a neighbor...,"They decided to go to a quiet place to share the lot equally.

One of them suggested the nearby cemetery.

As they were jumping over the gate to enter the cemetery, two oranges fell out of the big bag but they didn't bother to pick them up.

A few minutes later, a drunkard on his way from a bar passed near the cemetery gate and heard a voice saying: 

""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you...""

He immediately sobered up and ran as fast as he could to a nearby Church to get the Priest.

""Father, please come with me."" He said. ""Come and witness God and Satan sharing corpses at the cemetery""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate and the voice continued: 

""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

They both ran back to the cemetery gate &amp; the voice continued: ""One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you. One for me, one for you.""

The Priest, white in his face, whispered to the drunkard. 

""Dear Lord, you are right, but don't worry. They don't know that we are here.""

Suddenly, the voice stopped counting and asked a question.

Dear Mrs. Harris:

Over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.
We cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store.

Our complaints against your husband, Mr. Harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:

1. June 15: He took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

2. July 2: Set all the alarm clocks in Housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals.

3. July 7: He made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom.

4. July 19: Walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice, 'Code 3 in Housewares. Get on it right away'. This caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her Supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time and costing the company money. We don't have a Code 3.

5. August 4: Went to the Service Desk and tried to put a bag of M&amp;Ms on layaway.

6. August 14: Moved a, 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area.

7. August 15: Set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged.

8. August 23: When a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'Why can't you people just leave me alone?' EMTs were called.

9. September 4: Looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose.

10. September 10: While handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.

11. October 3: Darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'Mission Impossible' theme.

12. October 6: In the auto department, he practiced his, 'Madonna Look' using different sizes of funnels.

13. October 18: Hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'PICK ME! PICK ME!'

14. October 22: When an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;
'OH NO! IT'S THOSE VOICES AGAIN!'

15. Took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room?

And last, but not least:

16. October 23: Went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'Hey! There's no toilet paper in here.' One of the clerks passed out.",0,1585486331,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fr5fws/retired_husband_after_i_retired_my_wife_insisted/,Jokes,1

I went to a casino, went to the bar, and bought a drink before I did anything when I am approached by a beautiful woman. She asked me if I liked to have fun and I said yes, she then told me she would give me a hand job for 500 dollars and I laughed and said ""500 Dollars!? Why that much?"" She then whipped out her cell phone and showed me a picture of a Lamborghini ""You see this car? I paid for it by selling hand jobs."" So I shrugged and said ""What the hell, I need to live a little, I'll do it"" so we go back to my hotel and she gives me the best hand job I ever had.

She leaves and I pass out. The next night I go back to the same casino bar, and sure enough she's there again and I decide I wanted some more. I walk up to her and say ""You were amazing last night, how much would it cost for a blow job?"" She then smiles and says ""1 grand."" Again I'm a little bit set back by the price and I said ""A grand? Is it that good?"" She then whips out her phone and shows me a picture of a HUGE, luxurious house. She then says ""See this house? I paid for it with blowjobs"" so I said ""Alright let's do it"" so this time we go into her car and she decides to blow me in the parking lot, and its the best blowjob I ever had.

We sit there and I'm blown away by this woman, so I ask her, ""how much would it cost for some pussy?"" She then laughs and points to the casino. ""You see that casino?"" I said ""...yeah?"" She says ""If I had a pussy, I would own that casino.""

'Sister, do you mind if I touch them?'
She agrees, so the priest feels them up for several minutes.
'Father, may I ask you something?'
'Certainly!'
'I haven't seen a penis. Can I see yours?'
'I think it would be alright' responds the priest, lifting his robe.
'Oh, father, can I touch it?'

'Is this true, father?!'
'Yes, it is, sister.'
'Oh, father, that's wonderful! Then stick it in that camel so we can get the fuck out of here!'

**Excerpts from the diary of a cat:**

Day 983 of my captivity...

My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets.

Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.

The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet.

Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what I am capable of. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a ‘good little hunter’ I am.

There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of ‘allergies.’ I must learn what this means and how to use it to my advantage.

Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow — but at the top of the stairs.

I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded.

The bird has got to be an informant. I observe him communicating with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe.

The first man steps forward and says: i came home early from work today and found my wife naked in bed she told me that she was waiting for me to come home but i didnt belive her i checked all the regular spots the closet behind the door but i couldnt find him. so i went out on the balcony to get some fresh air because this had been a stressfull day but as soon as i open the door i saw that motherfucker habging on the outside of the fence so obviusly i started hitting his hands but he wouldnt let go so i went innside and got a hammer i continued to hit him with that and eventualy he let go but he landed in a bush and survived so i went back inn draged the fridge out on the balcony and tiped it over the edge after that i died of a heart attack because of all the stress. 

The gatekeeper agrees that this was a pretty horibke way to die and lets the first man in to heaven then he asks the second man how he died. The second man answers:

So every day i do some workout on my balcony but today i fell over the edge and started falling but i was fortunate enough to grab onto the balcony below mine so naturaly i started climbing up to try not to fall the remaining 17 floors but before i even start to climb a man comes out on the balcony and sees me hanging there he gets realy angry and starts hiting my hands but i managed to hold on then the madman walks inside and gets a hammer when he started  hiting my fingers with that i couldnt hold on anymore so i fell but landed in a bush and survived but the the lunetic went inside and got his fridge witch he dropt on me and i died

The gatekeeper agreed that this was a terrible way to die so he let him in to heaven. He askes the third guy how he died and the third guy answers

I travel around the world, speaking at various software engineering conferences.

I need to be engaging, bring in the audience, and make it all feel personal and real. As usual, I started off with a pretty standard presentation, introducing myself, establishing credibility, talking about the subject matter. But about 15 minutes in, I had everyone in the audience stand up, then I outline a new, hypothetical project and tell them they must evaluate it. I gave them the specifications of an aircraft and a deadline at which the project must be completed. I then told them I would ask them a few questions, and if their answer was ""no"", they could sit down, but if their answer was ""yes"", they remain standing.

""Would your marketing department would sell this package?"" Everybody remained standing.

""Could your team deliver this on time?"" About half of the audience sat down.

At this point, I knew I had them. ""Would you be willing to put yourself, your friends, and your family on this plane's first flight?"" At this point, the audience kind of grins at each other sheepishly, and slowly everyone sits down. But this time, one man remained standing. I saw this as a great opportunity, fully expecting a discussion about software testing, or something like that, so I asked him, ""You, sir! Tell me, why is that you alone among all of these people have the courage and confidence to put your loved ones on the line?""

Going to the local general store by his new homestead, he asks where he can get some animals.

Upon meeting, Old Man Murphy says to the gentleman I can definitely tell you’re a city slicker- Don’t worry, in time you’ll settle in and be just like one of us. The gentleman than asks well, how about that little hen over there. Maybe I can purchase it from you. Surely that would be a great animal to start with. Old Man Murphy says sure, I’ll sell you that one. But, just so you know young hens are actually called pullets. The gentleman sees a donkey off to the side and says well, that looks like a great animal to have at my new farm they are actually called an ass, right? How about I buy him from you. Old Man Murphy says now you’re starting to sound like a farmer. Yes, I’ll sell him to you but, he’s kind of stubborn. Sometimes he just lays down and won’t move. If you scratch on his back a bit he will get right back up and moving. Lastly, the gentleman says well no farm would be complete without a rooster. How about that one right there. Old Man Murphy says sure but, just so you know a rooster is actually called a cock. The gentlemen says oh yeah that makes sense. He thanks Old Man Murphy and starts the walk back to his own farm holding the birds and leading the donkey. About halfway back to his farm the donkey lays down in the middle of the road when suddenly a shiny red sports car pulls up with a beautiful woman driving.

But at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again. ""Frog, will you marry me?"" the guy shouted. The frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, ""NO!"" The man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter. The man laughed, ""This is fantastic."" He looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment Fifteen inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.


Grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, ""Frog will you marry me?"" The frog looked back across pond shaking its head, ""How many times do I have to tell you? NO, NO, NO!!""",12,1585454260,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqze3s/the_man_with_a_25_inch_penis/,Jokes,1

 It was a usual Tuesday morning, Rick went to work and Shirley was home with Spencer and Sprinkles. Per usual Shirley started her cleaning regiment, and per usual Spencer and Sprinkles were in her way. After countless times of foot prints on her perfectly clean floors, Shirley broke down and sent Spencer and Sprinkles outside to occupy themselves.  


  It was about forty-five minuets later, and Shirley was dusting the blinds. As she's dusting she's sees Spencer and Sprinkles sitting on the curb in front of the house. She thought 'How cute'. As she watched, she saw Spencer throw some M&amp;M's in the air catch them in his mouth, pick up Sprinkles lift Sprinkles tail up, and lick, He then proceeded to scoot one foot down the curb. Shirley couldn't believe what she saw.. She proceeded to watch him do it again; throw the M&amp;M's up,  catch them in his mouth, pick the cat up, lift its tail, lick, and scoot down the curb a foot.

So the horse calls up Guitar Center, and he says to the guy on the phone, ""Hey, listen. I wanna learn to play guitar.""

Guy on the phone says ""no problem. Come on down.""

""No, there might be one problem. I'm a horse.""

So horse turns out to be a natural. He gets GOOD. And he calls over Cow and Chicken and he's like ""LOOK WHAT I CAN DO"" and he jams out like Jimi Hendrix. And Cow says ""holy shit. That's awesome. I want to learn to do something like that too. What's like that?"" And horse says ""Bass. Learn to play bass.""

And one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. And he hears them, and he's like ""what the fuck? that sounds amazing."" so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. And he says ""Holy shit. You guys sound AWESOME. I wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. You're gonna be HUGE.""

So Cow and Chicken and Horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. REAL big. Top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. They get set for their first tour. But there's a problem, see. Horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. Cow and Chicken, though, they're cool as hell. They say ""Listen. Go see your mom. We'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.""

Horse says ""Thanks, guys. you're the best,"" and he takes off.

Couple of days later, Horse's mom is just fine. Turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. The following morning, he gets a call. It's his agent. Cow and Chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. The band is done. he's lost his best friends. And horse, this breaks him, man. He's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. So he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself ""Alright, alright. One drink, just to get over it.""

So Horse walks into the local bar. Bartender looks at him and says ""Hey. Why the long face?""",144,1585446670,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqxi1u/so_theres_this_farm_on_this_farm_theres_a_cow_a/,Jokes,1

Sometime after midnight, Holmes wakes up feeling insightful.
He wakes Watson up.

""Watson... as you look up into the night sky, what do you deduce?""

Watson rubs his bleary eyes, unsure what to make of Sherlocks sudden midnight curiosity. He rolls over and stares up into the sky, which was lit up with a million stars like diamonds on black velvet.

Watson responds. ""Well Holmes, as I stare into the cosmos, I can see that we are on a spinning ball in a infathomable expanse of nothing. The vast emptiness of space and scale of the universe leaves me feeling incredibly tiny, and therefore I deduce that our lives are small and insignificant in the greater scheme of things."" 

Holmes ponders this deep and insightful response for a moment. Rarely is Watson so articulate with his feelings.

Finally fed up, God said, 'THAT'S IT! I have had enough. I am going to setup a test that will run for two hours, and from those results, I will judge who does the better job.'

They created charts and graphs.   
They did some genealogy reports .

Jesus worked with heavenly efficiency and Satan was faster than hell. 
Then, ten minutes before their time was up, lightning suddenly flashed across the sky, thunder rolled, rain poured, and, of course, the power went off. 
Satan stared at his blank screen and screamed every curse word known in the underworld.   

Jesus just sighed. 
Finally the electricity came back on, and each of them restarted their computers. Satan started searching frantically, screaming: 'It's gone! It's all GONE! 'I lost everything when the power went out!' 
Meanwhile, Jesus quietly started printing out all of his files from the past two hours of work.   

Satan observed this and became irate.

I was home schooled because we live in the west and my father wanted me in an environment that was free from anything Haram. I couldn't associate with Hindus or Christians, anyone who ate unclean animals, or any girl. As a teenage guy going through puberty this was naturally a living nightmare. After years of begging from me and pressure from his colleagues, i was finally allowed to attend a very nice coed high school. The only rule was that i had to keep avoiding anything Haram. Being free for the first time i started to celebrate. Ate bacon my first day, had Hindu friends in a week, and within the month i had even met a girl. I was shy and awkward as i could possibly be but she liked me and thought i was funny. She was a little too hipster punk for me, listing to music i've never heard and using words like tubular and bae, but i loved it. Within two months we were dating. It was going great until my father heard about it. The Hindus and bacon he could overlook, but the women to him were really wrong. To him this was too much and he even claimed me of having sex with her. As if it couldn't get any weirder he actually demanded i show him my penis to prove i haven't been having sex. I had to ask him twice to make sure i heard him right. It was awkward but living under his roof i had to do as he commands. I started to go out with her on dates and every time i came home i had to whip it out for dad.

Jim, being a nice guy like he always is, offers a discount of 50% on the fees thinking they all might agree to get more.

Everyone happily gets more than one tatto. Jim makes a hefty profit by the end of his first day.

The word spreads around quickly and people in nearby towns and villages also come to Jim's place for tattoos. Many of them get weird tattoos on their foreheads, fingers, cheeks, ankles, shoulders too as it was 'Jim's Temporary Tattoo Place'.

After 3 weeks, they all return to get them removed now that they are not funny anymore or because the jokes got old.

They are shocked to find the place empty! They go to the sheriff and complain about it. 

The sheriff bursts into laughter. When the people ask what seems so funny to him, he says, 'Jim fooled you all! It was a temporary place'!!!",1,1585431808,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqt9ku/jim_opens_a_new_tattoo_place_in_a_town_and_all/,Jokes,0

So John and Mike went to the Mosque ahead and were greeted by an Arab Muslim, who asked what their names were.

John thought of a Muslim name and said, 'My name is Muhammad'. And Mike said 'My name is Mike'.

The Arab man said 'Hello Mike.' And told these other men to take Mike and give him food and drink.

The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, ""How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck."" But he pays it anyways.

The plumber tells him, ""Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.""

The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.

On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, ""What is the formula for the area of a circle?""
John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation. After staring at the board for a minute he looks out at the other plumbers and sees that they are all whispering, ""Switch the limits on the integral!""",3,1585425150,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqr5po/a_math_professor_john_is_having_problems_with_his/,Jokes,4

The third nun, an Italian girl, nodded her head in agreement, ""I too would like the same, but may I return with the face and body of Alice Gan Pipalini?""

With a confused look, Saint Peter replied, ""I'm sorry Sister, but I do not know of her? Is she a famous starlet?""

The Sister squealed with excitement,""Oh my, yes, yes she is! She's the most famous one of them all! Why, look at this article I've been saving for years!""

And with that, she reached into her pocket and pulled out an old, yellow, folded up newspaper article, which she handed to him with shaking hands.

Saint Peter slowly unfolded the paper and read the headline aloud,""Alaskan Pipeline laid by 500 men in one week.""",1,1585417344,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqopks/three_nuns_passed_away_and_went_up_to_heaven_they/,Jokes,5

The bartender says, ”Now turn it around and bite the other side”

The man excitedly turns the apple and chomps on the other end. “This is amazing! Is that Sprite?”

Friend 2 jumps in, “ No way man, let me try one” Bartender tosses him an apple, the man quickly takes bites from both sides and chews them together “Oh wow, it’s rum and coke!”

Bartender nods and says, “ I have any flavor you want, not just liquor. Skittles, oranges, carrot...” he mumbles while rummaging under the counter.

The third man speaks up, “You got one that tastes like pussy?”

All 4 men exchange glances. “Uhhhh...actually yeah I do” says the bartender, who dutifully digs around the shelves, produces an apple and tosses it to the man.

fqm8l8,dode222,"In a small American town, a band of squirrels had become quite a problem.","The Presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. After much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with God's divine will.

At the Baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. The deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. The squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.

The Lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of God's creatures. So, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the Baptist church. Two weeks later the squirrels were back when the Baptists took down the water-slide.

The Episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. They sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.

But the Catholic church came up with a more very creative strategy! They baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. Now they only see them at Christmas and Easter.

And not much was heard from the Jewish synagogue. They took the first squirrel and circumcised him. They haven't seen a squirrel since",2,1585409300,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqm8l8/in_a_small_american_town_a_band_of_squirrels_had/,Jokes,1

fqllep,GBCOLDO44,Head Larger Than The Shaft...,"Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. The study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. The study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex. 

After the results were published, France decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. They were convinced that the results of the British study were incorrect. After three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million Euros, the French researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex. 

When the results of the French study were released, Australia decided to conduct their own study. The Aussies didn't really trust British or French studies. So, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the Aussie study was complete. They concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.",3,1585407168,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqllep/head_larger_than_the_shaft/,Jokes,1

fqlk6s,Silver_in_Goldstin,"It was a beautiful, sunny Boston day ... (LONG)","and Patrick Wack, assistant manager at Bank of America, was sitting in his office, staring out the window, and wondering if he could claim he was feeling sick and skip out of work. It occurred to him that this might not be a great idea, however, with the schools closed. His kids would be bouncing off the walls and his wife was probably about to lose her mind and might take it out on him. He decided to surprise her by bringing home a couple of rolls of toilet paper he had found hidden in a cabinet in the employee bathroom. 

Patrick heard a throat clearing, and looked up to see a tall, thin man step into his office. “Ah, Monsieur Wack, I see you, too, have an unusual name. I am Jean-Paul René Jagger, citizen of the Republic of France. I wish to borrow one million euros.”

Patrick was startled by the request. “Well, Mr. Jag…“—but the Frenchman interrupted him. “Please! Call me René.” 

“All right, René. Well, we loan dollars here, but I’ll try my best to help you. What kind of collateral can you offer?”

René shook his head sadly. “Ah, you Americans—always so concerned with collateral. But not to worry!” He reached out a hand, and Patrick tried not to shrink back. He had just run out of hand sanitizer, and would really prefer to keep his social distance besides. But René surprised him by reaching into his jacket pocket and bringing out a figurine, which he set gently on Patrick’s desk. It looked like some kind of ceramic Bo Peep. 

Patrick was mystified. He looked up. “What is this?” 

“It is an inheritance from my grandmère. It has great value, as she told me when she lay upon her death bed. ‘René,’ she told me, almost as she breathed her last, ‘René, you must take great care of my most valuable possession.’” He looked at it proudly and then back up at Patrick. “Today I wish to trade my grandmère’s most valuable possession for one million euros.”

Patrick peered at the strangely childlike doll and then back up at the man. “Again, René, we loan dollars, but I’ll see what I can do. Can you tell me more about this…piece?” 

“It is a Hummel figurine. One of only 25,000 ever made. Its value is without measure.”

That didn’t sound too promising. Besides which, BOA wasn’t an auction house. Turning this thing into cash might prove difficult, especially with the economic downturn. Patrick thought for a moment and then said, “Would you mind if I take this to show my manager? Perhaps we can work something out.”

“But of course!” said René, who dropped into the seat on the other side of the desk and pulled out a gold cigarette case.

“I’m sorry, sir, but we don’t allow smoking,” said Patrick.

“It is of no consequence. I shall wait here for your return.” René returned the case to a jacket pocket, and smiled.

Patrick picked up the figurine and stepped into the bank manager’s office. “What?” growled the man, who seemed more irritated than Patrick to be stuck at work. He had a young wife and no kids.

""Well, sir,” said Patrick, “I have a potential customer in my office. He says his name is Jean-Paul René Jagger, and he wants to borrow a million euros. Well—dollars. I don’t know. Anyway, when I asked for collateral, he handed me this.” He set the Bo Peep on his boss’ desk. “Do you know what it is?”

His manager glanced down at the doll, and then looked back up. “It’s a knick-knack, Paddy Wack. Give the Frog a loan. His old man’s a Rolling Stone!”",0,1585407044,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqlk6s/it_was_a_beautiful_sunny_boston_day_long/,Jokes,1

Startled by her sudden outpouring of emotion, the man’s family gather round her. She wipes her tears and composed herself, and she says “oh I’m so sorry, the church bells just remind me of how John passed.”

Confused, John’s brother asks her to elaborate.

“Well,” says the widow, “John and I always made love on Sunday mornings. He was a little uncoordinated, so he would use the sound of the church bells to help his rhythm. In on ding and out on dong.”

Mortified but wanting to be supportive, John’s brother dares to ask what that has to do with his death.

The widow replies, “This passed Saturday John was feeling ambitious and asked if we could try making love without the help of the bells. We have it a go.

fqkexs,Drafixo,My father ladies and gentlemen...,"So, when we were younger we used to run a single line off the back of one of the snowmobiles, put a splitter on her with two lengths of ski rope about 25' long, gear up with helmets and suits, and throw two guys on on those flying saucers, (you know, like the ones on National Lampoon's Vacation) and then the sled driver would just “giver” down some snow covered back roads. 

Holding the rope with one hand you could steer the saucer by leaning. Object of the game was to knock the other guy off, preferably when he was on or near what were sometimes 10' embankments of ploughed snow at the side of the road. 

Hell of a lot of harmless fun for the most part, until one day it went bad. 

Paul and I had been bashing the hell out of each other for a while, and no one was coming off. I came at him quickly from my side of the road and made the initial impact with him just seconds before an old Ford Econoline “shagging wagon” with the classic big ole cb antenna on it, came round the bend in front of us. 

Long enough story short, I managed to stay over in our lane behind the sled, but as fate and all the timing that goes with it would have it, the van came even with us just as Paul bounced up the embankment, off a tree, and flipped over, on the wrong side of the road. 

Again, in a horrible twist of fate, he came down near the top of the van’s windshield, and the motion of the impact basically impaled him on the antenna that was jutting up from the top of the van. 

He survived the initial impact but later died in hospital. His blood system was poisoned by some ailment related to the dead insects that had beat him to the antenna. 

Maybe if he had had a flak jacket on he might have made it. 

Be careful out there folks. We all did some pretty risky stuff when we were younger.

So there are three guys who want to test to see who is the strongest And they’re walking in this construction site where it just rained so the ground is soft. So to see who’s strongest they decide to throw these bricks up into the air and see which one sinks deepest into the ground. Whoever’s brick sinks the deepest wins.

So the first guy goes, he throws his brick up, and it sinks like a foot into the mud.

The second guy goes, he throws his brick up, and it sinks like 3 feet into the mud.

The third guy throws his brick, and it doesn’t come down.

Get it? No? Well, maybe I’ll try another one? Bear with me. 

So there’s this woman on an airplane and she has a pet bird. And the rule for pets on the plane is that they can be there but they must be caged. Her bird hates cages, and she doesn’t want to put it in one. So she decides to keep it inside her coat for the duration of the flight.

About halfway through the flight, the cockpit opens and the co-pilot comes out and he smoking this big fat cigar, which isn’t allowed on planes but because he’s the pilot, the airplane staff just kind of allows it.

He’s making his way up the rows and he’s asking “hey, how ya doin, you havin’ a nice flight?” To everybody. He gets to the woman with the bird

“Hey, how you doin’? You havin a nice flight?” He asks

“Yes, I am thank you.” She responds

Just then, the bird starts cooing inside her coat.

“What was that?!” He asks

“What are you talking about? I didn’t hear anything.”

The bird coos again even louder this time. The pilot reaches into her coat and grabs the bird.

“You can’t have uncaged pets on this flight!” He says, and opens the window and throws the bird outside the plane.

Furious at the loss of her pet, the woman grabs the pilot’s cigar and says “well you can’t smoke on this flight!” And throws the cigar out the window.

Up ahead in the cockpit, the copilot looks to his left out the window, and sees the bird. And you know what’s in the bird’s mouth?

The other pub patrons cheer as the Texan sits in amazement.

The Texan gives the Irishman the $500 and says, “If ya don’t mind me askin’, where did you go for that 10 minutes you were gone?”

The Irishman replies, “Oh…I had to go to the pub down the street to see if I could do it first”.",3,1585381739,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqfsti/a_texan_walks_into_an_irish_pub/,Jokes,1

fqexix,danielgdaniel,A Sensitive Guy,"A woman meets a man in a bar.
 
They talk; they connect; they end up leaving together.
 
They get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears.
 
There are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!
 
It was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.
 
There were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.
 
She found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of teddy bears.  She is quite impressed by his sensitive side, but doesn't mention this to him. 
 
They share a bottle of wine and
continue talking and,
 
After awhile, she finds herself
thinking, 
 
'Oh my God! Maybe, this guy
could be the one!
 
'Maybe he could be the future
father of my children?' 
 
She turns to him and kisses him
lightly on the lips.
 
He responds warmly.
 
They continue to kiss, the passion builds.
 
And he romantically lifts her in
his arms and carries her into his bedroom,
 where they rip off each other's
clothes and make hot, steamy love.

She is so overwhelmed that she
responds with more passion,
more creativity, more heat than she has ever known. 
After an intense, explosive night
of raw passion with this sensitive guy,  they are lying there together in the afterglow.
The woman rolls over, gently
strokes his chest and asks coyly, 

'Well, how was it?' 

The guy gently smiles at her, 
strokes her cheek, 
looks deeply into her eyes, 
 
 
 
and says:

fqe1w5,bluesheepreasoning,They kept on bidding...,"In early 2009, a laboratory decided to do a free giveaway of a virus plushie to the kids in the surrounding region. The plushie had several taped messages inside, telling children how to wash their hands properly and practice proper hygienic standards set bt the WHO.

The parents of the kids were overjoyed to know this, and within days, the plush toy had already sold out.

The laboratory took this as a success and was took over by more requests. The company owning the laboratory split in two and one became a plush toy company.

The campaign was generally deemed successful and the company went on to sell soccerballs and even dog toys that encouraged cleanliness everywhere.

Some of the kids would eventually grow up to be biologists and doctors, and some would be drafted to work for many governments, including Russia, the EU, the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, and China.

In December 2019, one of the plush toys went on auction in Wuhan, China. The proceeds would be donated to an American charity.

The auctioneer spoke. ""Alright, our starting price is $100. Anyone have $110? $115?""

One spoke up. ""$120!"" 

""$120, any more? Going once!""

""$150!"", a second one popped. A third one came in as quickly as the second, bidding $160. Then a fourth with $170.

$175. $200. $300. The prices kept going up.

$500. $600. $1000. $1200. $1500. $1600. 13 bids had now gone up, yet there seemed no stopping.

$1700. $1850. $1900. 

16 bids. Then came 2 more.

""All right. Anybody else? This is your only chance.""

""$2000!"" ""$2010!""

""It's going good. Anybody else bidding?""

""$2020!"" Another voice popped up beside the person who had said it. ""Yeah, same.""

""Nice. Nobody? Going once, going twice. And... sold for $2020!""

The auction went quite well, and the plush toy went into the hands of this person and their friend.

They were quite hungry afterwards, so they went to the seafood market nearby and bought a bunch of fish.

However, the friend felt sick, and they decided to go back to their house while the other bought some food for them.

Over the next few days, the friend's condition worsened. Their breathing got worse, they suffered a fever, and it was decided to bring them to the hospital.

After a few days, it was found that he had a new disease, which looked oddly similar to the plushie his friend had bid for in the auction. 

This new disease rapidly spread around the world throughout 2020, becoming a pandemic. After becoming the subject of humiliation and various death threats, the friend realized the laboratory's possible relation to the virus. He analyzed the plushie, and sure enough, traces of the virus were on it. He looked up the company and threatened to sue it. 

The story became embedded in myth, and, centuries later, is still the leading myth on how the Virus of 2020 spread across the world.

The man became known not by his name, but by the disease, and the worst mistake he would ever make...

He got Co-bid 19.",5,1585372999,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqe1w5/they_kept_on_bidding/,Jokes,1

fqcqhf,rotzor123,Grandpa was summoned for an audit.,"The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office. The IRS auditor was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his attorney. 

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. 

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks. 

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’",6,1585367337,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fqcqhf/grandpa_was_summoned_for_an_audit/,Jokes,1

""What happened to Dr. Michaels?""

""I'm sorry to tell you this, Mrs. Lewis, but he retired a couple months ago. I'm Dr. Carradine, and I'll be performing your examination today."" The new Dr. gives her a reassuring smile, and she's still uncomfortable but tries to go with it. Dr. Michaels had been getting on in years, after all.

But then it was Dr. Carradine's turn to look uncomfortable as he began the examination. Mrs. Lewis couldn't figure out why that was, but the new Doctor looked visibly upset the entire time.

Finally, she had to know: ""Doctor, is there something wrong?""

""Well... no. No, everything's fine...""

As the exam went on, though, the new, young Doctor just didn't lose that look of being perturbed by something going on down there.

""Look, tell me what's going on! Right now!"" Karen blurted.

The new Doctor sighed, shook his head, and said, ""Well, I... I don't really know how to tell you this. There's nothing *wrong,* exactly, but...""

""But what!""

""Well, it's just that you've got the biggest vagina I've ever seen...""

Well, that was it. Karen was seething. She told Dr. Carradine that the examination was *Over*, got her clothing situated, and stormed out of the office. On her way home, though, she started to calm down and think about it. The doctor hadn't been trying to *insult* her... in fact, he'd gone out of his way to keep his mouth shut about what he was seeing until she blustered him into telling her. She decides she'd better have a look for herself.

She gets home, goes into the bedroom, then lays the full length mirror in the corner on the floor. She undresses and puts one foot on either side of the mirror, then looks down.

Just then, her husband leans around the door frame. ""Hi, honey, whatcha doin'?"" he asks, curious.

Blushing from her neck all the way up into her hairline, Karen stammers, ""I, uhhh, I'm just, um... exercising!""

It's a beautiful day and love is in the air.

Marie leans over to Pierre and says, 'Pierre, kiss me!'

Pierre grabs a bottle of Merlot and splashes it on Marie's lips.

'What are you doing, Pierre?' says the startled Marie.

'I am Pierre, French fighter pilot! When I have red meat, I have red wine!' She smiles and they start kissing.

Things began to heat up a little and Marie says, 'Pierre, kiss me lower.'

'I am Pierre, French fighter pilot! When I have white meat, I have white wine!' She giggles and they resume their passionate interlude.

Marie then leans close to his ear and whispers, 'Pierre, kiss me, kiss me much lower!'

Pierre rips off her underwear, grabs a bottle of Cognac and pours it on her pubes...

He then strikes a match and sets the cognac on fire. Marie shrieks and dives into the River Seine.

A tuba player thought it would be funny to hide with the instruments under the bus. The conductor, pre occupied with the many students, didn't keep track of that one player.

 Back at the school, one of the other Tubists, who was in on the gag, jokingly said ""We must have left him at the concert hall."" The conductor, only now realizing that the kid was missing, told everyone to unload the bus, and he would go get the kid. 

Once the conductor was already leaving to get the kid, there was a scream. A girl had started to unload her instrument when they saw the Tubists, dead and crushed.

fqahk4,Y2KoNo,A man with a gold claim in Alaska was cursed.,"At first the curse just brought him bad luck, causing vital equipment to break and provoking frequent but small injuries to him and his crew. Soon, however, the curse darkened and diggers the man had hired to help work his claim began to die in bizarre ways. 

One was killed by an African scorpion that should never have made it to Alaska, let alone have survived the cold. A second drank a gallon of the mercury used to separate the gold from the ore.  A third was found with a tree growing up through his body.

The man himself who owned the claim became more and more pale. His eyes became all white. His skin began to give off an overpowering smell of sulfur. He slept all day and at night he wandered the mountain above his claim, coming back each day looking more like a beast than a man.

The curse became so bad the last worker alive ran away to the nearest town to tell the authorities what was happening at the claim. 

In an attempt to save the claim owner's life and lift the curse, a priest was brought in by dogsled to perform an exorcism on the man.

A sherriff from the town came with the priest as a bodyguard.

fq9v4h,KairuSmairukon,A woman visits a florist's shop to get some flowers for her mother.,"As she's perusing, she notices the most gorgeous rose she's ever seen sitting next to the cashier, and asks how much it is. 

""Oh, sorry,"" the cashier replies. ""That one's not for sale. I got that as a gift from a fellow florist for hooking him up with a woman I met yesterday.""

""Yesterday?!"" she gasps. ""How did they hit it off so quickly?""

""Well, he's a handsome man and a wonderful lover, for one. He's a really nice guy, of course. And to top it off,"" he says, leaning into a whisper, ""*he's got a 10 inch cock!*""

She blushes. ""Sounds like a catch to me! Where can I find him?""

""He's just a block over. But fair warning...he's also a little...*kooky.* He's only interested in women named after flowers. So if I ever meet a woman with a flowery name, I send her his way.""

He points at the rose. ""Then, he sends me the flower as a thank you. Yesterday was Rose. A week ago, I recommended a woman named Violet to him,"" he says, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him. 

The woman thanks him for the info and leaves the shop, bitterly considering her own non-floral name. Undeterred, she visits the well-endowed florist's shop. She steps up to the counter and pointedly says, ""I heard you are particularly...*skilled*... in certain areas?""

He smirks. ""So I have been told. And who might you be?"" 

She grins. ""I was referred by your friend down the street. Perhaps you can...assist me?""

""I may, but tell me...what is your name, my sweet?""

She hesitates. Then, pouting slightly, she replies ""Kris."" 

His smile falters, and his head sinks as he shakes his head. Kris's heart drops, knowing she's blown her chance. 

""Well then...if it's not too much trouble, I'd like some flowers for my mother.""

Suddenly, he brightens up again. Without another word, he locks the shop door, swoops upon her, and takes her into his arms. 

Three hours of mind-altering sex later, she bids him goodbye with a kiss and a complimentary bouquet for her mother. 

""And please,"" he says, ""tell your sweet mama she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like."" Taken aback, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.

The next day, Kris feels incredible, and stops by the original florist's shop.

""I just wanted to thank you for telling me about that dashing gentleman! He was AMAZING!""

He smiles sheepishly. ""I suppose I should thank you too. I just got another beautiful flower for recommending you to him.""

""Really? What flower could he have possibly sent that was named after me?""

The florist sighs. ""Chrysanthemum.""",1,1585356333,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fq9v4h/a_woman_visits_a_florists_shop_to_get_some/,Jokes,1

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold
indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service
responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service
again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied, ""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The
Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

""Oh, sorry,"" the cashier replies. ""That one's not for sale. I got that as a gift from a fellow florist for hooking him up with a woman I met yesterday.""

""Yesterday?!"" she gasps. ""How did they hit it off so quickly?""

""Well, he's a handsome man and a wonderful lover, for one. He's a really nice guy, of course. And to top it off,"" he says, leaning into a whisper, ""*he's got a 10 inch cock!*""

She blushes. ""Sounds like a catch to me! Where can I find him?""

""He's just a block over. But fair warning...he's also a little...*kooky.* He's only interested in women named after flowers. So if I ever meet a woman with a flowery name, I send her his way.""

He points at the rose. ""Then, he sends me the flower as a thank you. Yesterday was Rose. A week ago, I recommended a woman named Violet to him,"" he says, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him. 

The woman thanks him for the info and leaves the shop, bitterly considering her own non-floral name. Undeterred, she visits the well-endowed florist's shop. She steps up to the counter and pointedly says, ""I heard you are particularly...*skilled*... in certain areas?""

He smirks. ""So I have been told. And who might you be?"" 

She grins. ""I was referred by your friend down the street. Perhaps you can...assist me?""

""I may, but tell me...what is your name, my sweet?""

She hesitates. Then, pouting slightly, she replies ""Kris."" 

His smile falters, and his head sinks as he shakes his head. Kris's heart drops, knowing she's blown her chance. 

""Well then...if it's not too much trouble, I'd like some flowers for my mother.""

Suddenly, he brightens up again. Without another word, he locks the shop door, swoops upon her, and takes her into his arms. 

Three hours of mind-altering sex later, she bids him goodbye with a kiss and a complimentary bouquet for her mother. 

""And please,"" he says, ""tell your sweet mama she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like."" Taken aback, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.

fq7oqw,kulikk17,A rancher dies and leaves everything to his wife.,"She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.

Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.
She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.

He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.

For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.
Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels."" The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.

One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.

Two o'clock and no hired hand.

Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.

She quietly called him over to her..

""Unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.

Trembling, he did as she directed. ""Now take off my boots.""

He did as she asked, ever so slowly.. ""Now take off my socks.""

He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.

""Now take off my skirt.""

He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.
""Now take off my bra.."" Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.

Then she looked at him and said, ""If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.""",2,1585349131,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fq7oqw/a_rancher_dies_and_leaves_everything_to_his_wife/,Jokes,1

They were both very much in favor of it.



The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine.



The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point they decided to try for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.

The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”



The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.



The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.



The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!

Having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. When our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. Because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

Because I didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. A few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! She tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. But it worked!

fq420s,ivytheblindhusky,A husband and a wife go to marriage Counseling. [Long],"A husband and wife visit a marriage counselor. First, the wife speaks to the counselor alone.

The counselor asks her, “You say you’ve been married 20 years. So what seems to be the problem?”

“The wife replies, “It’s my husband. He’s driving me crazy! I’m going to leave him if he continues!”
“How does he drive you crazy?”
“For 20 years,” she says, “he’s been doing these stupid things.

First, whenever we go out, he’s always looking at the floor and refuses to go near anyone. It’s very embarrassing.”
The marriage counselor is amused, “Anything else?”
“He keeps picking his nose all the time! Even in public!”
“Hmm, anything else?”
The wife hesitates, “Whenever we’re making love, he NEVER lets me be on top! Once in a while, I’d like to be in control!”
“Ah,” says the counselor, “I think I’ll talk to your husband now.”

So the wife goes out of the room and the husband says to the counselor, “For years I’ve been loving and considerate and I’ve always given her what she wants! What could be the problem?”
The counselor explains, “She says you’ve got these habits that are driving her crazy. First, you’re always acting strange in public—looking at the floor and never going near anyone else.”
The husband looks concerned, “Oh, you don’t understand! It’s one of the few things my father told me to do on his deathbed and I swore I’d obey everything he said.”

“What did he say?”
“He said that I should never step on anyone’s toes!”
The counselor looks amused, “Actually, that means that you should not do anything that would cause anyone else to get angry.”
The husband looks sheepish, “Oh. Okay.”

The counselor continues, “And you keep picking your nose in public.”
“Well, it’s another thing my father specifically commanded me to do! He told me to always keep my nose clean.”
The counselor smiles. “That just means you should stay out of trouble.
And,” he continued, “finally, she says that you never allow her to be on top during your lovemaking.”

“This,” says the husband, “is the last thing my father commanded me to do on his deathbed, and it’s the most important thing.”
“What did he say?”
The husband replies, “With his dying breath, he said, ‘Don’t screw up.’”",0,1585338136,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fq420s/a_husband_and_a_wife_go_to_marriage_counseling/,Jokes,1

fq3vz7,dmitriyzem,A rapist and con artist get caught by the sheriff in a small town.,"The town doesn’t have much money to take care of prisoners so the sheriff gets an idea. He decides he’ll charge money to let the townspeople punish the crooks and use the money to keep them in jail for as long as he can. The sheriff figures even a short stay in jail will be plenty after a little “justice” from the townspeople.

The sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. He tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. Since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

After a while there are two long lines for the criminals. Some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. After a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “He’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. I’m not going to waste my money on that.” So the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

The sheriff sees this and hurries over and says, “Hey son, you can’t do that here.”

The man asks, “Why not?”

And the sheriff replies, “Because this is the punch line.”",4,1585337644,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fq3vz7/a_rapist_and_con_artist_get_caught_by_the_sheriff/,Jokes,0

fq2nv3,MisterBigweld,Mr. Mann’s choice,"A mining company owner and CEO, Mr. Mann, was always focused on profit and straight up bussiness. His only wish now was to have somebody to share his wealth with so he decided to find himself a woman who will like him for who he is.

He met a Russian doctor named Nadezhda. She’s his age (51), witty, sharp-minded and was beautiful (she’s Russian after all). A stereotypical representation of an action movie antagonist but with a kind heart, she would make a great bussiness companion who will genuinely love him for who he is. “I would be happy with her for the rest of my life. Nobody makes a better companion in terms of bussiness and finances than your wife. She’s not in for the money because she has plenty already.”

Weeks have passed and he met a young starlete from Belgium named Chloe. She sure had all the right atributes to double his heart rate in a matter of seconds. Even though she seemed dumb and stupid, he knew that she was in for the money and that once he dies she will inherit everything he owns since he had no sons. “What the heck, why don’t I choose her? An obvious gold digger,  but why do I care? I have no children and I want some fun before I get too old. I don’t need bussiness companions, I need fun!”

A month later he met Margharet, an Australian hardworking housewife. She was born in the wild Australian outback and learned to fight with wild animals at a young age. “A heck of a housewife! I pay my housekeepers and maids 10.000£ a day in total and I can’t fuck them. Not only will I save money, but I also get to fuck her! Money means nothing to her, she only likes me because I go hunting and trekking often. If I get too old and boring will she leave me?”

So, who did Mr. Mann choose?

So imagine my mild mannered German 70 year old great uncle calmly telling this joke to the whole table. I had never heard him tell a joke before. It's still one of my favourite jokes*]

A man wins the lottery after years of crippling debt and financial stress.

His first idea is to quit his horrible job. Upon arrival at work and before he can say anything, he is summoned to the office of his boss.

""I'm sorry, but we have to let you go due to changed priorities. As this is not your fault, you will be compensated with a severance pay of $50,000. I'll be happy to introduce you to any future employer. Again, I'm very sorry.""

Astonished and surprised, the man leaves his former work place and thinks about his next plans.

He decides to buy his dream car. 

At the car dealership, he is greeted by confetti, flowers and large banderole reading ""Congratulations, customer #100,000!""

As the prize is a fancy sports car, he enthusiastically speeds home to finally tell his wife.

Stepping into his home, he slowly tip-toes from room to room to be able to surprise her.
After nearly checking the whole house, it almost seems like his wife is not at home, even though the door was not locked.

Suddenly he sees that the ladder to the attic is lowered. Slowly ascending, he is overcome by a strong suspicion and starts to breathe heavily.

And yes: there she is, dangling from a rope, a chair toppled over, a suicide note on the neatly placed shoes on the floor.

The man stands silent for a minute and finally speaks to himself.

fq1m5p,d_chs,There were 7 kings. One named after each day of the week.,"One of the weekend’s rulers was known for ruling over his military with an iron fist, Such that as little as a cross word said about the state would mean life in prison. 

One example that stands out was that of Sir John. A strong and noble knight who had a short temper when it came to his family name. He spent his days upholding the rules laid out for him and drinking inordinate amounts of ale.

Two peasants ran up to an intoxicated Sir John and blurted “your mom’s a rocket, man!”

Three seconds later, the usually steel faced knight slapped the bums across their faces. It took no longer than a few minutes for the king himself to show up with a sickle in an attempt to flex his muscles. He decreed “it shall be as such. One limb for each of the men you have dishonoured.” As the peasants pinned Sir John down at his right side. The king began to swing.

Five slices, it took to remove Sir John’s appendages. Unfortunately he died of blood loss at the scene. The king was so excited to have made an example of a senior member of the military that he rode off on his horse with unprecedented haste, swinging the arm &amp; leg around as trophies.

Eight rebel knights and three of their squires decided to hold a ceremony for their departed John. A funeral for a friend. As John’s corpse was being lowered into the grave, his widow came running down from the keep, yelling for the men to stop. 

Thirteen strides, the fair maiden took. All in attempt to hold her beloved once more. She made it to the valley and to her husband. She lay with his dead head in her arms. Love lay bleeding in her hands.

Twenty one years later, the lady Fibonacci was telling the story to her kids, on her deathbed. The legend of sir John and the mockery of the old rule.

fpz2ui,Lewminardy,A chemist and a mathematician are going camping in the woods.,"Night begins to fall and the sun starts to set. They begin to get cold and hungry. The mathematician gets the idea to start a campfire for warmth and cooking. The problem is that they do not have any wood. The chemist then suggests to go out and find some loose twigs and burn them.

As they venture out, the chemist hits the jackpot. Hundreds of stumps of wood are stacked up in a pile near their campsite. The difference between this wood is that it’s placed there for campers. None of the wood there came from the trees in the forest that they were camping in. He comes back with some wood and tells the mathematician about it.

“Check this out. I found a huge pile of wood up north of our campsite not very far away. We can take just a few stumps and we will be good for campfire fuel for the rest of the time we are here.”

The mathematician hesitated but the chemist ignores him and continues to take wood from the mysterious free pile.

When the chemist gets back he sees the mathematician with some wood and an axe. Curious about what’s going on the chemist asks him about it.

Chemist: “Where did you get that wood? Why do you have an axe with you?”

Mathematician: “I used the axe to get some wood from some nearby trees.”

Chemist: “You’re killing trees for no reason. Why wouldn’t you just take from the abundance of wood in the huge pile that I’ve been getting it from?”

Mathematician: “Because I prefer natural logs.”",0,1585323596,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpz2ui/a_chemist_and_a_mathematician_are_going_camping/,Jokes,1

fpynec,real27ny,My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",117,1585322201,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpynec/my_favorite_joke_everyone_knows_dave/,Jokes,4

He explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and

question of just how much of sex was ""work"" and how much of it was
""pleasure?"" A Major chimed in with 25-75% in favor of work . 
A Captain said it was 50-50%. A lieutenant responded with 25-75% in
favor of pleasure , depending upon his state of inebriation at the
time.

There being no consensus, the colonel turned to the PFC (Private First Class) who was in
charge of making the coffee. What was HIS opinion?

Without any hesitation, the young PFC responded, ""Sir, it has to be
100% pleasure.""

The colonel was surprised and, as you might guess, asked why.

By the afternoon I saw 5 cats trying to get to the chickens. I went and told my neighbor about the cats. He thanked me and decided to get a dog to protect the chickens from the cats. The dog didn’t do a very good job protecting the chickens and one of the cats got in the cage and ate a chicken. My neighbor took the dog back to the pet store since it didn’t do its job.

fpwl9n,wituta1,My favorite clean joke - the Old Man and the Ferrari,"A young investment banker goes out and buys the car of his dreams - a brand new Ferrari GTO. After paying  $500,000, he takes it out for a spin and stops at a red light. While waiting for the light to change, an frail looking old man on a yellow moped pulls up next to him. The old man looks over at the Ferrari and asks, ""What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?"" 

The young man replies, ""A Ferrari GTO. It cost half a million dollars!"" 

""Wheeewee... that's a lot of money,"" says the old man as he tucks his thumbs up against his suspenders. ""Why does it cost so much?"" 

""Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!"" states the banker proudly. 

The moped driver asks, ""Mind if I take a look inside?"" 

""No problem,"" replies the proud new owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around at all the bells and whistles lining the dashboard. Sitting back on his moped, the old man whistles and says, ""That's a pretty nice car, all right... but I'll stick with my moped!"" 

Just then the light changes, so the banker decides to show the old man just what his car can do. He floors it, and within 30 seconds, the speedometer reads 160 mph! Suddenly, he notices a yellow dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it could be, and suddenly... Whoooooosssshhhhh! Something blows by him, going much faster! 

""What in the hell could be going faster than my Ferrari?"" the young man asks himself. He floors the accelerator and takes the Ferrari up to 250 mph. Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the moped! Amazed that the moped could pass his Ferrari, he gives it more gas and passes the moped at 275 mph. Whoooooosssshhhhh! 

He's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again! Dumbfounded, the banker floors the gas pedal and takes the Ferrari all the way up to 320 mph. Not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again! 

The Ferrari red lines and there's nothing more he can do! Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end. The young man stops and jumps out, and unbelievably, the old man is still alive. He runs up to the mangled old man and says, ""Oh my God! Is there anything I can do for you?"" The old man whispers with his dying breath...

""What sort of town are you running here?!  You've got people running around the desert fucking coyotes, and- and just outside there was an old man masturbating openly!  How can you explain this?!""

fpuw8i,hayeshilton,Parish Priest,"The parish priest went on a fishing trip.

On the last day of his trip he hooked a monster fish and proceeded to reel it in.

The guide, holding a net, yelled, 'Look at the size of that Son of a B#tch!'

'Son, I'm a priest. Your language is uncalled for!'

'No, Father, that's what kind of fish it is - a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Really? Well then, help me land this Son of a B#tch!'

Once in the boat, they marveled at the size of the monster.

'Father, that's the biggest Son of a B#tch I've ever seen'

'Yes, it is a big Son of a B#tch. What should I do with it?'

'Why, eat it, of course. You've never tasted anything as good as Son of a B#tch!'

Elated, the priest headed home to the rectory.

While unloading his gear and his prize catch, Sister Mary inquired about his trip.

'Take a look at this big Son of a B#tch I caught!'

Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, 'Father!'

'It's OK, Sister. That's what kind of fish it is, a Son of a B#tch fish!'

'Oh, well then, what are you going to do with that big Son of a B#tch?'

Sister Mary informed the priest that the new Bishop was scheduled to visit in a few days and that they should fix the Son of a B#tch for his dinner.

'I'll even clean the Son of a B#tch', she said.

As she was cleaning the huge fish, the Friar walked in.

'What are you doing Sister?'

'Father wants me to clean this big Son of a B#tch for the new Bishop's Dinner'

'Sister! I'll clean it if you're so upset! Please watch your language!'

'No, no, no, it's called a Son of a B#tch Fish.'

'Really? Well, in that case, I'll fix up a great meal to go with it, and that Son of a B#tch can be the main course!

Let me know when you've finished cleaning that Son of a B#tch.'

On the night of the new Bishop's visit, everything was perfect. The Friar had prepared an excellent meal. The wine was fine, and the fish was excellent.

The new Bishop said, 'This is great fish, where did you get it?'

'I caught that Son of a B#tch!' proclaimed the proud priest.

'And I cleaned the Son of a B#tch!' exclaimed the Sister.

The Friar added, 'And I prepared the Son of a B#tch, using a special recipe!

The new Bishop looked around at each of them. A big smile crept across his face as he said, 'You mother f---ers are my kind of people!'

""Now remember....that's all original leather. You can't let it get too wet. If it starts raining and you don't have anywhere to shelter it, make sure you keep a tub of vaseline with you. Rub it all over the seat so the water will just bead off.""

The guy takes his new bike and goes to pick up his girlfriend. The girlfriend invites the guy over to her parents house for dinner. This will be the first time he's ever eaten with her family.

""I should let you know the rule of the table"" she said. ""There is no talking allowed. The first person to talk at the table has to clean the dishes.""

The guy doesn't think this is that big of a deal until he arrives at the family's house and looks in the kitchen. There must be at least three months worth of dishes inside. They are stacked up to the ceiling, stinking and rotting of mold and old bits of food everywhere. The guy almost throws up at the smell and sight of such a disgusting state of affairs.

Dinner begins, and no one is saying a word. The tension is starting to get to the boyfriend, so he concocts a plan to make someone else speak first.

The guy drops his fork, goes over to his girlfriend at the table, throws her up on top and just starts fucking her in front of everyone. The father and mother are obviously mortified. But even with their jaws on the floor, no one says a word.

The guy stops and thinks to himself ""This is going to be harder than I thought...."" then he gets another idea.....

Without hesitation, he runs over to the mother throws her up on the table and fucks the shit out of her, right in front of the father.

The dad is staring daggers through the boyfriend and turning bright red in anger. But still says nothing. The girlfriend is becoming teary eyed and covering her mouth with her hands, but doesn't make a peep.

The boyfriend stops fucking the mother and sits back down at his seat, completely flustered. He takes a gander out the window, and notices a sudden heavy rain has settled in. He then realizes that his vintage motorbike is parked on the street, uncovered.

The boyfriend pops out of his seat and grabs his tub of vaseline.
The dad jumps out of his chair and yells out, ""ALRIGHT, I'LL DO THE GODDAMNED DISHES!""",4,1585303447,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpud2w/the_first_person_to_talk_at_the_table_has_to/,Jokes,1

fptcso,fromsibir,The Girlfriend Joke,"So I recently moved into a new neighborhood and it's a pretty nice area. After a couple of weeks, a moving truck pulls up and I realize there's a new girl living in the house next to me. So I walk out and I notice that she's all by herself. 

Being the good neighbor I am, I go up and ask, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help. Do you need any help with moving your boxes inside?"" 

And keep this in mind, I'm like a 6/10 on good day while this girl is an easy 9/10. Like this girl can easily be a supermodel. 

So I ask if she needs any help and she looks me dead in the eye with the nastiest grimace on her face and says, *""Uh... No thanks, I'm good.""* 

""Well ok. No problem. If you need anything, just give a little knock on the door and I'll come out.""

So a couple days go by after that failed attempt and this girl's dumb, small chihuahua jumps over the fence and gets into my yard. So I'm thinking, ""Ok cranky girl. Round 2, let's go, we got this.""

So I take the dumb dog and I bring it over to her house and give the door a knock. She opens the door and with the biggest smile says, ""OH MY GOD thank you SO MUCH! I don't know what I would do without him. He's like family to me. I'm so sorry that I was so mean to you the other day. I was having a bad day and took it out on you and I'm so sorry. Please let me make it up to you and take you out to dinner.""

So I humbly accept and we end up going out to dinner that night. Now, we don't have much in common. Like, I'm into video games and anime and she's into all this white girl stuff like makeup, Starbucks, and all that other shit. But, we have a good time. And I mean, this girl is WAY out of my league so who am I to complain? So then we hang out more frequently, I visit her and she visits me and now I'm in a good relationship with this extremely hot chick.

A couple weeks go by, we continue this, and I see a moving truck come in from the other direction. I go out to greet the new neighbor and I see a cute girl come out of the moving truck. Now this girl is cute. She isn't supermodel hot, but she's cute. I would say she's like a 7/10. So I go up to her and say, ""Hey, I see you don't have any help with moving your stuff in. Is it ok if I help?"" Luckily, she says, ""Yeah, sure. Um, take this box and put it in the living room. It's the first room to the right, you can't  miss it.""

So I go to pick up the box and I realize that it's labeled ""*Video Games*."" The box wasn't taped very well, so I peek into the box and I'm seeing some serious video games. I'm seeing Final Fantasy 7-9 black label, a mint copy of Illusion of Gaia. Like, what girl even knows what that game is!? So I ask, ""Hey, is this a box of your boyfriend's stuff?"" and she responds with, ""No, I don't have a boyfriend. That stuff's mine so make sure not to drop it."" So now I know this girl is actually the coolest girl ever.

So I help the girl move her stuff in and we hang out afterwards. We go out to lunch and we hit it off. We ended up just talking about video games the whole time and it was amazing. Now I have a friend to talk nerd shit with and don't forget, she's a cute as hell 7/10. And I also have this 9/10 girlfriend with me. And again, I'm just a 6/10 so right now, I'm living the dream.

So a couple weeks go by and my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Hey, so this may sound weird, but I don't want you to hang out with that girl anymore. You're spending a lot of time with her and I'm honestly a little jealous and I want you to spend more time with me."" 

I tell her, ""Well listen, why don't you try to talk to her. If you like me, then you'll like her and then we can all hang out and it'll be great."" She says, ""Well...alright. I guess I'll give it a shot. I'll try to talk to her tomorrow

So next day, my girlfriend comes up to me and says, ""Uh, yeah you can't see that girl ever again."" 

""Wait, what? Why not? What happened?""

""Yeah she told me that you're hers now and if I ever go near you again, she is going to kill me.""

""I think you're overreacting a little bit. She doesn't seem like that type of person""

""She told me, and I quote, that she is going to *fucking murder me*.""

""I can't imagine that it's that serious. I'll try to straighten this out and go talk to her tomorrow.""

I go up to 7/10's house the next day and give it a little knock on the door but nobody answers. I try the doorbell, nothing. Give her a call, text her, no answer. So then I call my girlfriend, try to tell her that she wasn't there and I'll try again tomorrow. But again, no answer. So I go over to her house, knock on the door and still no answer. Next day knock* knock* no answer and I don't know what's going on.

So day after day goes by and eventually, week after week and I'm getting nothing. I put in the missing persons but nothing turns up. I call their family and friends and they know nothing. And after weeks of all this, I just give up.

Then I turn the news on one day, and I see the 7/10 girl getting carried away in handcuffs. And, she's covered in blood from head to toe. She's screaming and yelling at the camera saying, ""She's dead, you're next."" A couple days go by and the autopsy reports are coming in, and its all over the internet. Apparently, not only did she kill my gorgeous 9/10 girlfriend, but parts of her were missing. Chunks of her arms and legs were gone and it seems that the 7/10 girl ate parts of my girlfriend. Bit and chewed into her.

Now I'm thinking to myself that I had the two most amazing girls in my life. And I'm here, 6/10, just worried out of my mind because I can't get the image out of my head of her screaming into the cameras saying, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" And I'm going crazy, I'm screaming and writing it in blood on the walls, ""She's dead, you're next. She's dead you're next."" AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT DO DO ANYMORE. 

And it raises the question: Why is 6 afraid of 7?",282,1585297583,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fptcso/the_girlfriend_joke/,Jokes,1

fpt8h6,gabdulina,An old dying man invites 3 of his friends to his deathbed and asks a favor...,"
He says, ""We've been as brothers for longer than I can remember, and while I was not rich in life, I would like to bring some wealth with me as I die. If you could each leave $5,000 in my coffin, it would bring me great peace.""

The three men saw no fault in this, as they were all very rich, and all upstanding members of their respective communities.

Jim was a devout, aging Catholic, and he brought the five thousand in large bills, so as not to occupy much space in the coffin. He later told the members of his congregation, and oh how they lauded him on his selflessness to ease the mind of a dying friend.

Michael was a converted Muslim, and he feared that the dead had no use for paper money, so he converted the five thousand into gold for his friend, leaving the ingots next to the bills. He felt a great warmth inside of him, a feeling that can only be brought about by a good, charitable deed.

David was born Jewish, but wasn't so devout as many of his colleagues. He refused to buck off the stereotype and worked as a moneylender, a loan agent. Because of this, he understood how exchange rates worked and how trying to convert 3 different types of money to one may be hard for a man with little experience handling cash. Therefore, he wrote a check for fifteen thousand dollars, and took the gold and bills as change. He left his friend's side with such a great smile, he must have known the time he'd saved him in the afterlife.",6,1585296893,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpt8h6/an_old_dying_man_invites_3_of_his_friends_to_his/,Jokes,1

fpniod,shinobi2154,There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living...,"There was a man in Bulgaria who drove a train for a living.

He loved his job, driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. 

He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. 

Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. 

He made it out, but a single person died. 

Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. 

He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. 

When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. 

After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. 

The switch was flown, sparks flew and smoke filled the air- but nothing happened.

The man was perfectly fine.

Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. 

And somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. 

Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. 

Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. 

The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. 

For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. 

After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair.

The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was once again unharmed.

Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. 

And once again, he somehow manages to get his old job back. 

To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. 

And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. 

On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal- three bananas.

""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat, we're strapping you in and doing this now."" 

Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. 

The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room- and the man was still unharmed. 

The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",46,1585270421,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpniod/there_was_a_man_in_bulgaria_who_drove_a_train_for/,Jokes,1

fplxrx,Mr_President777,FBI OPEN UP,"There was an FBI Commissioner, and he was on an undercover case to expose a supposed bomb dealer. The Commissioner had all the pieces of the puzzle together, except one final part: the Commissioner needed a confession from the dealer that he was in possession of weapons of mass destruction.

With that settled, the Commissioner, upon tracing the dealer back to his supposed homestead, set off to the dealer’s location. However, after his arrival, the Commissioner was met with a dumbfounding situation. The dealer had a three-story mansion that was surrounded by gates the size of one-story buildings, guards comparable to that of WWE wrestlers, and so many guard dogs you’d think the National Dog Show was in town.

Despite these odds, the Commissioner formed a plan: he would enter the house as a pizza delivery man. The rest of the plan would be improvised, to reduce the stress of nailing the exact requirements. So, until the meeting with the dealer, events followed like this: the Commissioner acquired a mass amount of pizza, dressed as a local pizza man, drove to the dealer’s complex, entered through the gates on foot, pet a guard dog’s nose, and proceeded into the prestigious mansion.

After rolling in the final cart of pizza boxes, the dealer walked around the corner and was in awe at the colossal amount of pizza that sat in his lobby area (there was probably enough food to feed a Viking village).

“What the hell is all of this?” he yelled out of confusion.

“Someone felt the need to engorge themselves.” The Commissioner said in a smug tone.

“Probably one of my guards. Damn dumbasses found out my pin and have been wasting my wallet on food ever since. Here let me tip you a fifty for your troubles.”

“No need. I would like to get some feedback on my humor, been meaning to get into comedy lately.”

“What are you? Five? Here. Take the money.” 

“All I need is the feedback.” The Commissioner stated as he secretly hit the FBI speed dial button on his phone.

“Fine. Lay your humor on me. I haven’t got all day.”

“Knock Knock?” 

“Who’s there?”

“I have a bombastic personality.” 

Confused at the line, the dealer slowly states, “I have a bomb-“
 
“Sir, I am Commissioner Smith from the FBI, and I was sent here to formally arrest you for being in possession of weapons of destruction.” Commissioner Smith stated as he whipped out his badge and a thousand FBI agents descended upon the mansion.",0,1585264616,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fplxrx/fbi_open_up/,Jokes,1

You lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. You think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. Yes, I know you.'

The lawyer was stunned. Not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'Mrs. Jones, do you know the defense attorney?'

She again replied, 'Why yes, I do. I've known Mr. Bradley since he was a 
youngster, too. He's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. He can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. Not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. One of them was your wife. Yes, I know him.'

The defense attorney nearly died.

The judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,

'If either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, I'll send you both to the electric chair.'​​​​​​​",2,1585263774,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fplpka/mississippi_grandma/,Jokes,1

A year passed, and only three people applied for the very demanding position: a Japanese samurai, a Chinese samurai, and a Jewish samurai.

The emperor asked the Japanese samurai to come in and demonstrate why he should be the chief samurai. The Japanese samurai opened a matchbox, and out popped a bumblebee. Whoosh! went his sword. The bumblebee dropped dead, chopped in half.
The emperor exclaimed, ""That is very impressive! “The emperor then issued the same challenge to the Chinese samurai, to come in and demonstrate why he should be chosen. The Chinese samurai also opened a matchbox and out buzzed a fly. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! The fly dropped dead, chopped into four small pieces.
The emperor exclaimed, ""That is very impressive!""
Now the emperor turned to the Jewish samurai, and asked him to demonstrate why he should be the chief samurai. The Jewish Samurai opened a matchbox, and out flew a gnat. His flashing sword went Whoosh! But the gnat was still alive and flying around.

The emperor, obviously disappointed, said, ""Very ambitious, but why is that gnat not dead?""

Close to the shore lurks a bear. ""When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots out of the water, I'm gonna catch it midair and have a nice meal!""

On the other side of the lake patiently waits a hunter. ""When the spider jumps down on the water strider, and the fish shoots up to eat them both, and the bear comes out to catch the fish, I'll shoot the bear!""

Next to the hunter sits a small, tiny mouse. ""When the spider eats the water strider, and the fish the spider, and the bear the fish, and the hunter shoots the bear, he'll be distracted so I can steal the cheese sandwich from his bag.

Next to the mouse sneaks a cat. ""When the spider gets the water strider, the fish the spider, the bear the fish, the hunter the bear, then the mouse will come out so I can catch it!""

All is thought and done. The spider jumps down and catches the water strider. Suddenly, the fish shoots up and catches them both, only to be caught midair by the bear.

Because our cat likes to chase our parakeet we didn't want to leave them unchaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again. Because I didn't want the Uber driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, I explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. 

A few minutes later he got into the Uber all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the car pulled away, ""Sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and I had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out!

Jane then explained to him what sex was.

Tarzan said ....""Tarzan use knot hole in trunk of tree.""

He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe.
Finally, he realized his solution.

On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. 
He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck.
Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to play with his unit.
He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ""What?""

He heard, ""This is the police. What's going on down there?""

The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.'

Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another.

fpaxzr,abusarin,Blind pilots,"A plane is preparing for takeoff with a full load of passengers when the pilot and copilot board--both with dark sunglasses and tapping walking sticks for guidance. The passengers are understandably uncomfortable, but assume it must be some sort of practical joke, so they say nothing.

As the plane begins to accelerate, the passengers see the end of the runway rapidly approaching, with certain doom awaiting at the end if the pilots really can't see what they're doing. Just before the end of the runway, all the passengers scream together--right before the plane lifts off. They're a little upset, but relieved that the pilots aren't really blind.

In the cockpit, the pilot turned to his copilot and remarked: ""you know, Lou, one of these days they're not going to scream in time, and then we'll be in real trouble!""",14,1585226996,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fpaxzr/blind_pilots/,Jokes,1

The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin.

However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before!

fpactb,pingyuluo,Why I fired my secretary,"Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning. I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 
""Happy Birthday!"", and possibly have a small present for me. As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ""Happy Birthday."" 

I thought... Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids... They will remember.

My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent. 

As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 
""Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday!"" 
It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered. I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me."" 

I said, ""Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go!""

We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. 

She chose instead a quiet bistro with a private table. 
We had two Martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.

On the way back to the office, Jane said, ""You know, It's such a beautiful day... We don't need to go straight back to the office, do we?"" 

I responded, ""I guess not. What do you have in mind?"" 
She said, ""Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.""

After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, 
""Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment. I'll be right back.""

""Okay,"" I nervously replied. She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake. 

Followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing ""Happy birthday"".
And I just sat there...

The man and woman stare at each other in amazement, but their attention soon turns to the angel, who's quite satisfied with himself, grinning from ear to ear.

He says to the couple, ""You guys have been staring at each other while locked in stone for the last 100 years, completely unable to do a thing about your urges for each other."" He pauses, and then adds: ""It's still pretty early, and people don't usually get to the park for another 30 minutes. You two should go into that covered area and…well, just have a good time.""

The man caught the eye of the woman, who had a twinkle in her eye and wore a mischievous grin. She bit her lip seductively, and with that the man grabbed her hand and the two ran off to the bushes.

The angel then found himself privy to giggles, laughter, rustling, and squeals of delight. Fifteen minutes later, the couple emerged from the bushes hand-in-hand, out of breath and faces flush.

The angel glanced at his watch. ""You still have fifteen minutes, you know. You can have another round if you'd like!""

fp86v2,fycetothesky,An elderly woman enters the Canadian National Bank with a bag full of money,"She insisted she wanted to speak with the president of the National Bank in order to open an account, saying ""a lot of money"" was to be dealt with.

After some hesitation, the staff escorted the elderly woman to the president's office. The president asked how much money she wished to deposit in the bank.

'$165,000' she answered, and poured the bank notes from her bag on the table.

Obviously, the president got really curious about the origin of all this money, so he asked where the cash came from.

'Gambling' she muttered.

'What kind of gambling?' the president asked.

'Bets. Let me give you a real example. I'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are rectangular.'

'Hahaha. That's a stupid bet. You could never win.'

'Would you care to accept the bet, then?' asked the elderly woman in a challenging tone.

'Of course! I'll bet $25,000 that my balls aren't rectangular!'

'Since it's such a large sum, would it be possible for me to return tomorrow morning with my attorney as our witness?'

'Sure' said the president of the bank in an extremely satisfied tone.

That night, the president actually got scared because of the bet. He spent quite some time in front of the mirror, checking his balls, turning them to the left, to the right, and to the left again. He meticulously inspected them to make 100% sure his balls weren't rectangular so he could win the bet.

The next morning, the elderly woman entered the president's office with her lawyer. She introduced the latter to the president and repeated the bet.

'So $25,000 that the president's balls are rectangular!'

The president accepted the bet once again, then the little old woman asked him to lower his pants so they could all see his balls. The president complied. The elderly woman inspected his balls really closely, then inquired whether she could touch them, which the president accepted... after all, he had the opportunity to win $25,000!

That's when he noticed the woman's lawyer started to bang his head against the wall.

'What's the problem with your attorney, m'am?'

'Oh, nothing. Only that yesterday I bet him $100,000 that today I'd hold the president of the Canadian National Bank's balls in my hand.'",4,1585212709,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fp86v2/an_elderly_woman_enters_the_canadian_national/,Jokes,1

""I wanna see Natalie""

The lady looks the man up and down, he clearly doesn't have a lot of money.

""I wanna see Natalie""

""Well it's still $1,000""

""O.K., I have the money""

The boss wants some files brought to his house so he can review while stuck at home. When the young man arrives he sees his boss in a neck brace, robe and pajamas and uncomfortably sitting in a large chair. The boss beckons him over and thanks him for bringing the files

The young man agrees and heads upstairs to the master bedroom, but walks past a room with the bosses two beautiful twin daughters who are home from college. 

He back tracks and says with a cheeky grin ""ladies, your father asked me to come up here and pleasure the both of you. He was pretty insistent""

The daughters stunned look at him and say ""that doesnt sound like our dad...""

fp7gzf,malte86,A politician dies...,"And ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. Saint Peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.

""So, you're a politician..."" ""Well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""Oh no, no problem. But we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in Hell. After that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""Wait, I have to spend a day in Hell??"" says the politician. ""Them's the rules"" Says St Peter, clicks his fingers, and WOOMPH, the guy dissapears...
And awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in Hell. Cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... Nothing. Just the smell of, is that fabric softener? And cut grass, this can't be right?

""Open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""C'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". Nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. A nice one too. Wait, this is a penthouse suite... And there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""Who are you??"" The politician asks. ""Well, I'm Satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""Welcome to Hell!"" ""Wait, this is Hell? But... Where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. Satan throws him a wink. ""Oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. Anyway, this is your room! The minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. But enough of this! It's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" Slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""It's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says Satan, answering his unasked question. So they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as Satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. And as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. And out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. Everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. He spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. Later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where Ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with Marylin Monroe). As everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... And they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. After 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% Egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...
And is woken up by St Peter. ""So, that was Hell. Wasn't what you were expecting, I bet?"" ""No sir!"" says the man. ""So then"" says St Peter ""you can make your choice. It's Hell, which you saw, or Heaven, which has choral singing, talking to God, white robes, and so on"". ""Well... I know this sounds strange, but on balance, I think I'd prefer Hell"" says the politician. ""Not a problem, we totally understand! Enjoy!"" Says St Peter, and clicks his fingers again.

The man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. As he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. A sudden bolt of lightning reveals Satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ""What's this??"" He cries. ""Where's the hotel?? Where's my wife??? Where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???""

After dusting themselves off, the Nun and the Priest surveyed their situation. After a long period of silence, the Priest spoke, “Well, Sister, this looks pretty grim.”

“I know, Father. In fact, I don’t think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two.”

“I agree,” says the Father. “Sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?”

“Anything, Father.”

“I have never seen a woman’s breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours…”

“Well, under the circumstances I don’t see that it would do any harm.”

The Nun opened her habit and the Priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.

“Sister, would you mind if I touched them?”

She consented and he fondled them for several minutes.

“Father, could I ask something of you?”

“Yes, Sister?”

“I have never seen a man’s penis. Could I see yours?”

“I suppose that would be OK,” the Priest replied lifting his robe.

fp04aa,franklin2014ish,EMPLOYEE NOTICE!,"Due to the current financial situation caused by the Corona Virus and slowdown in the economy, the Government has decided to implement a scheme to put workers of 50 years of age and above on early, mandatory retirement, thus creating jobs and reducing unemployment.

This scheme will be known as RAPE (Retire Aged People Early).

Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to the Government to be considered for the SHAFT program (Special Help After Forced Termination).

Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW program (System Covering Retired-Early Workers).

A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as the Government deems appropriate.

Persons who have been RAPED could get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependents &amp; Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance).

Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by the Government.

Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. The Government has always prided themselves on the amount of SHIT they give our citizens.

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him. 

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked.  Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting.    While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out;  could you get a divorce in heaven.  After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

Little did the hunter know, there's a mouse watching his sandwich, and the mouse thinks ""If that fly drops 6 inches, fish will get the fly, bear will get the fish, hunter will drop his sandwich and shoot the bear, I'll get the sandwich, I'll have a nice meal on my hands.""

Little did the mouse know that there's a cat watching the mouse. The cat thinks ""if that fly drops 6 inches, fish will get the fly, bear will get the fish, hunter will get the bear, mouse will get the sandwich and I'll get the mouse, I'll have a nice meal on my hands"".

Then, it happened. The fly dropped 6 inches, the fish got the fly, the bear got the fish, hunter dropped his sandwich and shot the bear, mouse got the sandwich, and the cat went for the mouse, but missed. The cat went for the mouse but ended up in the river, completely soaked.

Moral of the story, everytime a fly drops 6 inches, a pussy is gonna get wet.",0,1585171267,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/foyin8/i_think_i_got_a_good_one_for_this_subreddit/,Jokes,1

foybbd,asarvepalli,Ok - I finally understand my life.,"On the first day, God created the dog and said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past.  For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking.  How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

So God agreed......
On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh.  For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years?  That's a pretty long time to perform.  How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God agreed......

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family.  For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years.  How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed again......
On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life.  For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years?  Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God.  ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.  For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.  For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren.  And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

The voice persistently states as he drives home. The man again ignores it and kisses his wife hello.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

He hears it as he's eating his dinner. His wife asks him what is wrong. ""Nothing honey, just have some work things on my mind.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

He wakes up in the middle of the night, the voice becomes louder and louder.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

He can no longer sleep. He feels like a zombie as he drives into work.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

Right in the middle of staff meeting the voice in his head screams.

\*Quit your job. Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

""Fine! Boss, I'm sorry, you've been great, but I got to go, I'm sorry I didn't give you two weeks."" He drives home.

\*Sell everything. Go to Vegas.\*

He sells his car and fine watches, his wife threatens divorce as he tries to list the house. He lists it anyways and sells it. His wife cries as she leaves him.

\*Go to Vegas.\* 

He goes to the airport without even a handbag and buys a one-way ticket to Vegas. He lands at McCarron International airport. 

\*Go to the Mirage.\*

Excitement begins to build in his mind. Whatever this is, it's finally moving. He takes a cab to the Mirage.

Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her
boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and
make love for the first time. 

The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he
takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.
He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the
pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the
boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex. 
At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many 
condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family
pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he
thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and
all. 

That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house
and meets his girlfriend at the door. 
""Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come
on in!"" 

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table
where the girl's parents are seated.
 
The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.

He'd only have sex with the lights off.

The wife assumed he merely had some shame in the penile department, but she loved him, so happily obliged. An added bonus was that it felt like he was actually reasonably well-equipped downstairs, so everything was good.

However, 20 years of blind sex took its toll on her and their relationship. In the middle of one of their love-making sessions, the wife dived for the lamp and turned on the light.

She saw her husband with his pants on and a dildo in hand.

There was a brief moment of silence, then the wife sternly stated ""You have some explaining to do.""

The husband looked her dead in the eye and said ""I'll explain this when you explain the kids"".",20,1585159110,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fouut8/a_husband_will_only_have_sex_with_his_wife_on_one/,Jokes,1

fou88t,Phil_Macooter,Married couple couldn’t sleep,"There was once this married couple that lived next to a farm. 

They’ve always wanted to live in a rural area because it would allow them to escape the madness of a big boomin’ city. 

However, one night when they were sleeping, a rooster starting going crazy and making all of this noise. This noise was nonstop and kept the couple up all night. This would continue for days on end. 

On the 6th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. So the husband got outta bed and went to go talk to the farmer to see if he could do anything about it. 

The farmer did nothing. 

On the 7th day, the rooster started going crazy again and making all of this noise. The husband then gets ready to go over to the farmer again but the wife stops him. She says, “Hey Sweetie I got this. Go back to bed.”

So the wife gets up and heads over to the farm. 

Twenty minutes later she comes back and goes to sleep. The rooster didn’t make any more noise for the rest of the night and wouldn’t make noise for the months to come. 

One day the husband asked the wife, “hey how did you ever get that rooster to stop making all of that noise?”

And the wife said, “Honey, talking to the farmer was pointless. Everyone knows there’s only one true way to quiet a raging cock...you strangle it till blood comes out.”",0,1585156997,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/fou88t/married_couple_couldnt_sleep/,Jokes,1
