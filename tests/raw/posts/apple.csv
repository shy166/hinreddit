fscdro,beanislife,iPad Pro 2020 or Macbook Air,"Hey all, 

I am really hoping to get some advice. I am currently using a 2011 15"" macbook pro and I have finally given in to the fact that it is time to upgrade. I have been impressed with how long this computer has lasted but it is finally showing its' age. That being said I am trying to decide between getting another macbook or going with the new iPad pro. The new keyboard that will be released in May will be a game changer for the iPad but I am still not sure if it can function as a complete macbook replacement. I will be using it for the next year for grad school, mostly excel work. After that it will become my catch all device for everything I would rather not do on my iPhone. I don't do any photo editing or video work so mainly I will use it for browsing, light excel work, video conferencing with friends and family out of state. In addition it will come with me when I travel for movies and such on the plane. I have some concerns about excel on the iPad as I have heard it is painful to use compared to on a computer. Also, I am concerned about the longevity of the iPad which is why I am on the fence. The iPad pro feels like the future of Apple, but how long can I expect it to last and not get bogged down with endless software updates that make it unusable? I know having an expectation for my next device to last 9 years is unreasonable but I would still like to make this purchase last as long as possible since I don't typically upgrade until my computers are painfully slow.Let me know your thoughts!",0,1585659199,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fscdro/ipad_pro_2020_or_macbook_air/,apple,1

fsb5aj,BRORR,Need Feedback! Help me decide! Mega Deal on a XS Max or 7 Plus vs higher $$ iPhone 11 or 11 Pro Max,"FYI, the plans &amp; prices below are as far as I know specific to Alberta, all prices are listed in Can $ as well. Regardless I would appreciate all opinions and feedback from wherever you may be in the world!


So I'm cutting ties with Rogers here in Canada’s ASAP and likely switching to Telus this time as they seem to have the best network for rural Alberta. That is of course, unless you change my mind. 

As far as I can find, the best phone prices and plans to suit someone like me that lives well outside the service area range for the few cheaper city based providers like Freedom Mobile etc. Oh and I don’t like Public Mobile, it’s 2020, who wants to get by on only 3G wireless haha. 

*All Phone and Plan Options Under Consideration*

- PHONE PLAN -

This plan from TELUS is really the only plan I’m considering at this point as it has everything I would ever need at a fantastic price (for here anyways).  

TELUS - PEACE OF MIND CONNECT
Loaded with every option besides AppleCare,  Unlimited Canada wide call &amp; text, 20 Gb / line data LTE+ shareable between family or other devices like an iWatch or Cellular tablet. 

Special Offer price is $75 / line or $65 / month with 3 line family plan which I’m going to do and then also get my Mom &amp; Dad a new phone &amp; plan set up. (When not on sale, plan is $95 / line)


- PHONE PURCHASE OPTIONS - 

I plan to get 3x (myself &amp; Mom/Dad) yet I want to either pick only 1 model OR 1 for me and 1 model for my parents who wouldn’t make as much use as of a ultra premium phone. Likely neither would I, but I’ve always been a sucker for the latest / greatest when I can afford it. Of the listed options, I’ve only ever tried my current  iPhone 7 Plus, despite being quite happy with it, it’s ageing and on its last legs. 

It would be great to hear some feedback on the other devices to help me decide and if the extra money spent on the 11 and or 11 Pro Max is worth the cost in comparison. 

All 4x of these iPhone options from TELUS are new (not refurbished ). All are limited time offers that include $0 down, 0% interest on the device cost and monthly equal payments over 24 months. 

(1.) 
The first two options (IPhone 7 and XS Max) aren’t  locked in any contract but there is a 24 month term, although prior term ending, all ties can be cut any time by simply paying the device balance, which is the original cost minus any payments that have been made. (Example: Anytime between months 1 - 24. New IPhone $ - monthly payments to date = total amount left owing. Once paid, device is 100% yours. 

(2.) 
A minor variation is the purchase plan i picked for the last 2 iPhone options I’m considering (11 and 11 Pro Max). To keep costs in line I chose an option  TELUS offers called “Bring Device Back,” which essentially is just a lease for a smart phone.  At the end of the 24 month term, you have the option to either just hand the phone back to TELUS or you can “buy out the lease” pay the remaining equity value left in the phone and keep it. 


- SMART PHONES OPTIONS -
Offers on options 1 &amp; 2 expire tomorrow.

Only problem is it’s iffy on audio(my dad spilt coffee on it..) and obviously the butterfly keys are terrible. I had to completely take off the backspace key and it’s just very impractical to use.


I’m tempted to just keep it instead of replacing it incase there’s something for school I HAVE to have a laptop for, and get an iPad for pretty much everything else. I planned on just getting the newest iPad(not the pro), an apple pencil, and a keyboard. This would cost me around $500 instead of the ~$1000 to get a new laptop, plus I could take notes on it.

What are the downsides to doing this? What are the upsides?

fr7kll,New-Monarchy,Has there been any updates on how Apple flat out degraded the noise cancelling feature for the AirPod Pros?,"For those unaware, the latest firmware update for the AirPod Pros (2C54) severely degraded the quality of the noise cancelling feature. This was released way back in December 2019! Noise cancelling for lower end sounds (i.e. bass heavy noises) is pretty much nonexistent anymore.

Since then, I haven’t seen/heard any news or press coverage towards a fix. We’re now approaching 4 months since that update. Strange considering how often firmware patches were released before.

Is a fix in the works? Am I an idiot and missed something?

Many people (myself included) purchased these quite literally for that specific noise cancelling feature, so I fully admit to being mildly salty.",0,1585495636,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fr7kll/has_there_been_any_updates_on_how_apple_flat_out/,apple,1

fr4weq,dozzinale,Compatible 85 W Power Adapter with a MBP 13’’?,"Hello there! Due to a problem with my electrical network, the original power adapter of my MacBook Pro 13’’ (2014) is now broken. I have ordered a new one but due to the emergency here in Italy, the delivery is expected for the next week (at least). I use my MBP for working and the only power adapter I can use right now is a compatible MagSafe 2 85 W with output 18.5V and 4.6 A (it is the only one I found nearby).

My question is: can I use this kind of compatible power adapter with my MBP? It seems the voltage is different (the original one is 16.5V).
I googled it and there are [discordant voices](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-a-85w-charger-with-any-Macbook) about it, someone says it is ok to use it, someone says no. I do think these are considerations for the original power adapter, so maybe these do not apply to a compatible one.

Could you enlighten me? Thank you!",0,1585483484,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fr4weq/compatible_85_w_power_adapter_with_a_mbp_13/,apple,1
fr4pna,LilScheiSir,Replacing MacBook Pro with MacBook Air 2020?,"I have a 2018 MacBook Pro with 4 TB3 Ports, i5, 8gb of RAM and 256 SSD.  
Since the new Macbook Air doesn't have the Butterfly keyboard anymore (especially no TouchBar, i hate that thing), I started thinking.  
What if I sold my MacBook Pro and bought an i5 MacBook Air but with 16GB of RAM?  
16GB Ram just gives me a better feeling, idk.

My Usage: very light, mostly used for university (OneNote, Pdf's, ...) and for web browsing (in Safari, mostly media consumption like YT and Twitch).  
The hardest task for my MBP is the occasional Minecraft gameplay with my gf, and it even runs relatively fine even on her 2017 MB air.

what are your thoughts? Thanks for any advice

fr4e81,fortniteplayr2005,MBA 2020 Keyboard Travel?,"Hi all,

I'm mostly a Windows user due to VR on my desktop. However, I used to have a 2015 MBP and I liked it a lot for the ease of use, awesome trackpad, great screen, etc. The only thing I despised was the terrible keyboard. I've used a lot of newer Thinkpads for work and the keyboards there have great key travel depending on the model. Even the lower key travel ones like the X1C seemed fine.

I noticed the 2020 MBA has a new keyboard (or... old?). The pictures online and videos I've seen have made them look a little bit more stuck out which makes me think the key travel is better.

Do any of you have any experiences that you could share that could help me out in this purchasing decision, such as your feeling on a ThinkPad KB vs the latest MBA? I would like to demo a unit but obviously given the COVID situation that doesn't really seem like a good idea or an option at this point. I really like everything about MacOS so I know that side is good, it really is just the keyboard I'm contemplating on at this point. I type pretty fast and often, so it's my second most important aspect behind the trackpad for a good laptop experience.

I recently thought I noticed a dead pixel on my Touch Bar (another reason to hate the thing!) but to my surprise couldn’t find any tools to help confirm it. 

So I created a tool imaginatively named [Touch Bar Display Test](https://github.com/amarcu5/TouchBarDisplayTest), and thought I’d share it here in case anyone else finds themselves like me.

Free, open source, and written in Swift. Super simple, just cycle’s through a number of different colors. Unfortunately, as it has to use a private API, I can’t put it on the App Store.

At the moment it’s only really good for testing defective pixels and uniformity but I could expand it out (gradients, gamma, etc.) if there’s interest.",23,1585393747,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fqi6lw/to_the_obsessive_ones_like_me_now_you_can_test/,apple,1

fqdt32,Pictor13,Is Apple Mail broken?,"I am trying to export my emails to reimport them in another account.

I tried to ""*Export mailbox*"" several times, but the resulting file size is different from export to export.

The export filesize was in total 332,2 MB.

Then 136,3 MB. Then 334,2 MB.

In three different attempts on the **same** mailbox.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""*Window -&gt; Activity*"" doesn't give any sign of life, or task running, so there is no way to know when an export has been completed, if it currently running, how it is proceeding, if there was any error. Nothing. Just cross-fingers and faith. Not really *deterministic*.

I also tried to configure the two (IMAP) accounts on Mail, trying to just ""*Copy to*"" the new mailbox, but the process is flaky, copied just few hundreds of emails from the several thousands in the source mailbox.

To me the functionalities are just broken, without any report about successes or failures; hence completely not trustable for a reliable backup.  
(I am anyway considering to switch to a more reliable application than Apple Mail, for business emails)

I plan on splurging on the apple watch since i passed on my Galaxy watch to my mom when i switched. I've been wondering if i should get the airpods (newest pro version) or if they're not really worth the money. Any thoughts? If not worth it, suggestion if an earlier generation is worth it for the price? 

I would primarily use them when walking/jogging, listening to youtube videos in bed to not disturb my other half at night and the occasional conference call if my work connection is having issues.

fooygq,adventurelounger,Maybe Apple should apply their contactless ApplePay wizardry to the lowly doorknob,"Covid-19 is showing the benefit (and need) for contactless solutions. Which will likely persist after this pandemic dies down.

It never occurred to me how often we actually touch door knobs (just like it never really occurred how often we touch our faces). And we touch them at two significant germ transmission points—entering our homes (after our hands have been out in the world), and getting into and out of bathrooms:

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/smarter-living/5-things-around-your-home-you-never-clean-but-should.html?referringSource=articleShare

Many newer cars have moved to “keyless” entry (although you still have to lift the door handle). So imagine using your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock and pop open doors for (mostly) touch-free entry.

Huge ApplePay fan here. I’m sure Apple is already thinking about the contactless future. Where else might it apply?",0,1585136918,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fooygq/maybe_apple_should_apply_their_contactless/,apple,1

I need some help. I have an older 2012 MacBook Pro. The HHD died on it a week ago so I bought a SSD as a replacement. 

I’ve installed the SSD into the MacBook Pro, and I boot the Mac into Disk Utility. I try to reformat the SSD to Journal which fails or tells me that the Drive is not mounted. Whenever I try to reinstall the OS the Mac simple refuses to show that the SSD in the options. The drive does appear on Disk Utility but as not mounted. 

How do I “mount” the drive so I can install MacOS onto it?

The editing part is great and I'm loving Final Cut, but there are a lot of drawbacks/limitations with recording that are making me feel like I overpaid for a Macbook and could of spent me money better by going with a cheaper one for editing/other creative work, and a cheap PC for capturing my consoles. Also on top of the fact that I should of gotten a cheaper one and waited for the 2020 13/14 inch model which looks like its going to be a better value and at that point would only be a ""want"" and  not a ""need. 

However, I also don't want to downgrade too much and regret that either.

TLDR; My question is what is a cheaper 13 inch MBP that can handle 1080p60 editing? Won't be doing any 4K.",0,1585059262,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fo5sgh/macbook_for_1080p60_video_editing/,apple,1

fo24i3,alfonso220,RANT: Apple Software,"Hey guys,

I've been an Apple user for years, I bought from them,:Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, Apple TVs, software, and accessories.

I thing in recent years things are in beta all the time. For me and a lot of people the golden era of Apple (in recent years) was around 2010-2011 when stuff used to work well, software, devices, including the iPad 2 or large iPod Touch as it was called, we had Snow Leopard and MacBook and MacBook Pros with lot of ports and functionality. I remember you could even take out the superdrive and get another hard drive on the laptop or even upgrade the RAM!!! Isn't that crazy!

But now everything is kind of weird, the software is really buggy, Apple introduces functionality that breaks other parts of the software experience and complicates everything a lot more, like the iPad multitasking system, or iOS software since iOS 6, specially with the redesign of 7. Don't get me wrong, there are great things that have come in this years, but the experience is not plug and play or using the legendary attention to detail that Apple had in before 2010.

It's not only an Apple problem, the web sucks for example, everything asks you for passwords, and two step verification, captchas, password managers.... Now everyone is offering a VPN services... Also, websites have so many javascript and trackers and stuff on them that browsers now are one of the most resource intensive apps in normal daily usage. Just look at [apple.com](https://apple.com), the scrolling works horrible with the new way of presenting products, I know it looks cool if you have a recent and powerful computer with a fast internet connection, but, is it really necessary?

Now there is always something running in the background in iOS and macOS, things like photoanalisysd or mediaanalisysd or mdworkers or weird helpers from apps and browsers that cannot be disabled, specially by non technical users.

Hardwarewise I bought a new 16 Inch MacBook Pro and I already have problems with audio popping sounds ghosting in the screen, it's been 6 years since my last MacBook Pro and things are worse... It doesn't make any sense... Of course it's faster, but the rest of the hardware is not better at all...

It's like everything is in beta and factors like attention to detail, simplicity and plug and play are now secondary to new features that are refined at all.",0,1585041553,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fo24i3/rant_apple_software/,apple,1
fo1zi5,Adamh1122,Can’t import GoPro5 to IPadPro using USBC,"Hi,

I have recently started using my GoPro and found out I could transfer data to my ipadPro using USB C rather than the app. However, when I connect them, the photo import doesn’t automatically pop up and i have to click the photos app then the import button...I then get a message on the ipad saying no photos to import...on the gopro it says Downloading files and then usb connected. I have tried to wait encase the files were downloading but nothing happens, i still get the same text saying “No photos to import”.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone got a fix for this issue?? I have tried to look online but cant seem to find this exact issue.

Because of iCloud Messages, it instantly deleted it across all of my devices... except for my iMac, for which I coincidentally forgot to enable messages in iCloud. Now I can copy the iMac’s messages files to my laptop, and let the laptop restore them back into iCloud.

Sure, more frequent backups could have solved this issue as well. I do recommend this specifically, however, because, unlike a backup, this will always stay up to date with the present (except for deletion, obviously, but that’s the point).

TL:DR: keep a Mac not using Messages in iCloud, and protect yourself against accidental deletion.",8,1585034015,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fo0tja/recommendation_keep_your_oldest_mac_not_using/,apple,1

&amp;#x200B;

so I guess I'm not the only one who's been wondering for the last couple of years whether to buy an iPad Pro to replace my laptop or not. 

With the improvements iPad OS received in the last updates &amp; the recent changes announced by Apple, what are your thought about it? Is Apple finally true when they say ""your new computer, is not a computer""? 

What are the Pro &amp; Cons about switching to an iPad?

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, so you could understand a bit more my situation, I'm a freelance copywriter who's been using MacBooks for years &amp; I'm about to go overseas for at least a year on a working holiday visa. All I need is something to type on.

fnf6za,zed910,[How To] Syncing iOS Apps via iTunes,"I'm probably in the extreme minority here, but I came across an issue that's taken me a week to figure out a solution to. I finally figured it out and now I want to share in case anyone else needs this.

The goal: I want certain 3rd party iOS apps from iPhone 3GS (running iOS 6) to be on iPhone 4S (also iOS 6).

The problem: said Apps no longer offered old version on App Store. Neither Finder (Catalina) nor the most recent version of iTunes, 12.9.5, support App syncing.

History: Apple updated iTunes 12.6.2 to iTunes 12.7 and stated they were streamlining the experience. They removed App syncing (among other things) completely in 12.7. At the same time they released iTunes 12.6.3, a special version marketed at businesses. This version re-included App syncing.

More problems: iTunes 12.6.3 doesn't run on macOS Mojave or higher. My 2019 MacBook Pro can't downgrade macOS to get the iTunes 12.6.3.

Resolved that by installing a copy of Windows 10 in Parallels. Once I had iTunes 12.6.3 installed I got an error when trying to authorise my Apple ID so that the Apps could be transferred from iPhone to iTunes. The error code had a ""learn more"" button leading to HT208104. To summarise, Apple doesn't let some older iOS/macOS/iTunes versions sign into Apple IDs anymore for security reason.

With low expectations, I chatted Apple Support. They couldn't give me any solution. They met my expectations, lol.

I then had the idea that solved it. I updated iTunes (in Parallels) to iTunes 12.9.5, authorised my computer, then re-installed iTunes 12.6.3. Typically computers give a fuss when you're trying to install older software atop something newer, but 12.6.3 was specifically designed to be installed when you already had something newer.

iTunes 12.6.3 installed without giving any errors and was still authorised with my Apple ID. I was able to successfully sync purchased iOS apps from iPhone 3GS to iTunes, then over to iPhone 4S. Voilà!

It's unlikely someone will be in my exact same scenario, but more likely that others have their own reasons for needing to sync apps to iTunes. For you, this is the help you're looking for.",0,1584944309,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fnf6za/how_to_syncing_ios_apps_via_itunes/,apple,1

fne271,PoeJeter,iPhone X/XS consistent screen issue,"**TLDR** at bottom 

iPhone X/XS consistent screen issue

Over the last year+ I’ve had multiple different iPhone X/XS/XS Max etc. and I have become extremely annoyed by how difficult it has become to control the “cursor” as well as the keyboard. 

Particularly when it comes to highlighting words, sentences, or whole bodies of text, especially single letters. 

For example, I use Notes a lot. If I have saved some custom font, signature, or whatever text it is I’m trying to “grab” i.e. highlight and then copy- 

I always end up highlighting too much, the wrong word/letter/area etc. OR accidentally deleting or spacing and most of the time it seems like it just won’t recognize my thumb at all. 

I’ve literally put 6-7 different brand new screen protectors on the XS I’m currently using in the last 4-6 weeks- it never makes a difference. 

I always have auto iOS updates, there’s no physical/liquid or any damage to the phone whatsoever. I’ve tried resetting my keyboard settings/history. I’ve done multiple “soft resets.” It’s never a battery issue. Apple diagnostics has not detected any issues with any part of the phone- despite being willing to and having replaced the display module recently. 

It still constantly happens and it’s super irritating when you write to the extent that you could have enough composed to fill multiple entire novels, screen plays, albums, or anything for that matter.  

The keyboard is whole different problem and this is already probably TLDR so just know Siri must hate me and love to mis-autocorrect intentionally hurtful and personally negative suggestions all the time, as well as not being able to autocorrect/fill the extremely obvious simplest things. 

It also varies in levels of difficulty between different apps/browsers/platforms/etc., you’d think though that at least within a standard stock Apple application that doesn’t require an internet or cellular connection of any kind, you’d at least be able to consistently make effective use of the one of the biggest functions of these $1,500.00 annual investments. 

** TLDR ** 

Why does my “cursor/highlight/copy” mechanism hate me or my thumbs?

Does Siri intentionally do this because of wanting to play her role in natural selection?

Is it a physiological/nerve problem or something my skins texture/blood flow? 😒😑",0,1584938416,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fne271/iphone_xxs_consistent_screen_issue/,apple,1

fndc6a,KeithHopkin,Help! I can't delete the U2 album from my device(s),"So we all remember that U2 album that Apple automatically put on our devices around 2104? Well I am a few devices in since that time and last year I thought I would finally make the effort to try to delete it from my phone because every time I get in my car the album starts playing by default. The link Apple put out long ago no longer works because this was pre two-factor authentication and the page is not set up for that. I just get stuck in a loop of trying to sign in. I even went to an Apple store not too long ago and they couldn't help. It doesn't even look like I can turn Two-Factor auth off. This is driving me nuts.

Here's the old link to remove the album

Recently purchased iPhone 11 (64 gb) and feeling perfectly fine using it. Used to have this very old model prior.
Everything is working well just there’s this tiny thing I wanted to point out. Very minor. Wanted to hear your thoughts about it whether I am the only one or not experiencing it. 

After I open up an Instagram story (especially if it’s been HOURS of me not touching it) there’s  NO sound on the first insta story, obviously, cos you gotta press on the volume button to let the sound be heard  but when I do the following, it wouldn’t sound unless I move to another story (with also a sound) 

As for the usual insta posts with sounds, there’s no similar occurrence ( sound comes on after tapping the video image, instantly) 
I know it’s a tiny thing, I shouldn’t be making a deal out of it and I’m not, just putting it out there whether you guys experience the same thing and if it’s a common thing with the iOS 13

I've heard using a fast charger is painful for batteries, however I've also heard that the excess heat with the wireless charger can be harmful. I've never really experienced my phone, even with a case on, that charging wirelessly to be ""hot"" or even fairly warm to the touch. 

Another thought I have is that the longer a battery is between 20 - 80% the better. I've heard that the health of a battery can be effected in the charging range between 0 - 20% and 80-100%.

Now I know it's not the biggest deal, and apple (as well as other companies) do a good job of making the necessary tweaks in software to prevent the degradation of the battery.  However over the average life of these phones, but it could be the differences between needing to upgrade in 3 years to needing an upgrade in 4 years.",0,1584931356,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fncipm/is_a_75_watt_wireless_charger_better_for_battery/,apple,1

fn0qwr,misterdhm,A few thoughts on the HomePod,"I've wanted one for a while but the high price kept me away, until last week when my wife got one for me for my birthday. I've been consistently, and repeatedly, impressed with it and I think it could be one of my favorite Apple products I've ever owned. I know a lot of reviews mention how Siri is woefully underpowered compared to OK Google and Alexa, but that doesn't matter to me at all. I disabled Siri on the HomePod entirely because I just don't like the idea of having listening devices in my home, even from Apple who I trust far more than Google and Amazon. For me, the reason I like the HomePod comes down to two things: sound quality and ease of use.


First, sound quality. I'm no audiophile but I do have a set of Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers on my computer desk that I use for most of my music. The HomePod can't hold a candle to that system (which is far less expensive too) but that Promedia 2.1 setup is in my computer room, not the kitchen. I wanted a HomePod so I could have room-filling audio in the kitchen and also hear from the den and the living room, and in that regard it works beautifully. The four-inch subwoofer on the HomePod sounds incredible for such a small speaker, and combined with the rest of the speakers it just puts out audio that sounds extremely well balanced. I've been hearing little subtleties in music I've listened to for years that I never noticed before, all thanks to the HomePod. It's not going to blow the windows out or make your eardrums bleed, but it just sounds good all around. It gets really loud too, and when I turn it up the sound isn't all distorted or muddy or anything. It keeps the same well-rounded mix of bass, mids, and highs even when it's turned up all the way.


And second, convenience. The reason I don't care about Siri on this thing is I've got a massive library of music and audiobooks on my iMac, and I can access them instantly with the Remote app on my phone. My wife can too, so with a quick tap either of us can instantly play any of the tens of thousands of tracks in our library, or put on an audiobook for the kids. If I'm watching a video on my iPad with the kids I can send the audio through the HomePod with a quick swipe from the top-right corner. And we can have a house-wide dance party by playing music on the HomePod and my computer without any issues with the music being slightly out-of-sync.


I have been thoroughly impressed with this HomePod, even more than I thought I would be. I've heard other speakers like the Echo and Google Home and the fact that Apple put audio quality first and foremost on the HomePod makes it ideal for someone like me who doesn't care about having any type of audio assistant.",106,1584887468,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fn0qwr/a_few_thoughts_on_the_homepod/,apple,1

fmyngf,themeanteam,Heat dissipation Clamshell Mode,"Hi everyone, I have been using my Macbook Pro 15"" 2018 in Clamshell mode for about 1.5 years and it's been great. Recently, I was reconfiguring my desk and wondering if I should use the MBP screen as a secondary display to my 4k LG 32"" Widescreen monitor. I decided to do some research and found some older threads where people say that running it open will give it better cooling and make the laptop 'last' longer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I worked for a bit (Browsing on Safari) with the laptop open and monitoring temperatures. Here are the results:  


Clamshell temps after an hour of browsing: Avg. 45C

&amp;#x200B;

Took an hour break

&amp;#x200B;

Open Laptop after an hour of browsing: Avg. 57

&amp;#x200B;

I would guess it's due to the (obvious) fact that by opening the laptop screen, you get a second monitor that the unit has to display/render/etc.

Reaching you today because I'm looking to design some accessories for Mac (Macbook Pro, Mac Mini) essentially and since there is a Accessory Design Guidelines for iPhone, iPad, Watch... I was wondering if there's one for all the Mac computers.

Here is the document I found [https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf](https://developer.apple.com/accessories/Accessory-Design-Guidelines.pdf) and wish to find a similar one for the Mac. Any chance any of you have it or know where to find this?

My research so far are not fruitful and it is mere impossible (or I'm really bad at it) to find any guidelines/blueprints with all of them.

By advance thanks a lot!

fmem7f,dankphrank,Wondering if anyone can help with Apple ID security,"Hi everyone, having a bit of a nightmare with my Apple ID at the moment and Apple has been no help what so ever.

Basically, someone has signed into my iCloud account from God knows where (second time it has happened, first was from China) and changed my security questions. Obviously with how retarded apples security policies are, to change the security questions you need to answer one of the ones previously set. I don't have this information, and when I contacted apple, they said without the answer to these questions they can't do anything? 

I have 5gb worth of documents and images stored in there and I don't want anyone to have access to them, does anyone know of a way to resolve this? 

Ideally I would like to nuke the account as I haven't had any apple products for over 6 year, but I'm getting brick walled by Apple support.

Apples advice is they can't do anything, so they are letting an unauthorised user access my iCloud and what is stored in it, surely this is a breach of grpr? 

Any advice/ suggestions would be greatly appreciated",0,1584795680,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fmem7f/wondering_if_anyone_can_help_with_apple_id/,apple,1

I’ll listen more carefully over the next few days for sound quality, but in terms of easy of use I can see these replacing the Bose in nearly every circumstance!

As I'm sure many of you are experiencing the Great Work From Home Experiment, I write to seek help on purchasing new hardware to make this transition more seamless. 

Essentially, I would like to purchase a monitor, mouse, and keyboard. Currently, I am working on a 13-inch 2019 MacBook Pro, and desperately need a second screen (and not just something to mirror what's on my laptop).

Does anyone have any suggestions on a compatible monitor/keyboard/mouse? Please keep in mind it DOES NOT have to be Apple (just compatible) and that I don't plan on spending more than $300 on a monitor.

My work does not require any specific tech -- I just need more screen space :)

I know the surface competition and countless other 2-in-1s are cheaper and serve dual purposes but Apple constantly argued there is no need for this. Now, they’ve introduced it and no one is batting an eye at their previous claims, and treating it as some genius revolutionary thing online.

I use it pretty frequently to watch movies, tv shows, youtube, etc. while I am working on my other monitor. However, there are a few small frustrations that I have. First of all, the mac is unable to recognize the iPad camera and mics, why not? I use a mac mini and don't have a webcam or external mic, I think it would be cool if my mac could recognize and utilize those when connected to my iPad. Secondly, every time I connect my iPad I have to rearrange my desktop set up. I usually put my iPad on my desk below my monitors, but every time I connect it, my Mac assumes that I have the iPad set in between my monitors.

I was on YouTube, and there was a Song I wanted to get on ITunes, and I got an abo to it, so that I can download whatever I want for free you know. And I clicked on the link of the video to get to the ITunes Store, and then, it said that this song was not able to get in the german store or in the country (Germany) at the moment, and it asked me if I wanted to change it. I clickes on „ok“, and since them, my ITunes Store speaks only english, even if it says - when I click on „Show Apple ID“ in the settings - that I got Germany as a country, and also can‘t change it anyways, because my father owns the family abo. But I can’t hear several songs because it says that what you see in the title. How can I change that back to how it was?

fl9n3d,ashcammy,"MacBook Air Retina 2018 battery life is less than the advertised 10+ hour “all day” and “best quality’ battery life, that it’s being promoted as. Is this normal? Or should I be concerned?","Hi, 

I upgraded from a 2013 MacBook Pro to a MacBook Air 2018 Retina display and was just damn thankful my laptop didn’t die every 3 hours so I didn’t realise that my laptop’s battery life is not as good as others. Hell, my friend has a 2016 (?) MacBook pro (cant really remember the year) and it lasts longer than mine. 

It wasn’t until I went back to uni and had 9am to 5pm classes, and my laptop kept dying by 4pm that I realised there was a problem. So my laptop dies if not charged every 7 hours approximately, which definitely does not add up to the 10+ hour claim and even 12 hour claim that it is meant to have. 

How much hours do you get of your MacBook Air 2018 retina display? Is it 7 hours like mine? Or is that too low? Do I have a problem? 

Does anyone have any idea how I can fix it without bringing it to an apple store as I’ve just started uni and don’t have time to get it fixed? 

My one year warranty ends by mid year this year, but as I said I don’t have time to go. Is this a serious concern that I should go see about? Am I getting ripped off with my 7 hour battery life?",0,1584622865,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fl9n3d/macbook_air_retina_2018_battery_life_is_less_than/,apple,1

Now i tried to use them for some voice apps like discord or a 3d world learning platform. And the AirPods seem not to like them. I get a static murmur when one of these Apps start and cant hear anything or the audio quality is really bad. Mic is really bad too.

Thats both while paired to a surface 7 pro. The internet is full of these problems with AirPods and voice apps for years but no fixes.

&amp;#x200B;

Is that a known problem between non-apple and apple products? if i use my wired earpods with the surface 7 pro everything works fine. Or is it a problem on MacOS too?",0,1584528034,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fknjl9/airpods_pro_only_for_musicyt/,apple,1

fkmjuy,aa2051,"The new Powerbeats 4 seem too good to be true, and I think you should definitely be excited for them.","So if you aren’t aware, not long ago Apple announced the Powerbeats 4, and I’d like to start a discussion about the seemingly great deal these little things are.

The Powerbeats 4 are essentially the Powerbeats Pro, minus the small wire connecting them (they are still wireless though) and the charging case, and are 100 dollars cheaper.

Even though they’re about half the price, they have the same audio quality that has been almost universally praised online. Even by my boy Linus. On top of that you get a lightning port, the Apple H1 chip just like in AirPods,

And, get this, a 3 hour longer battery life than the twice-the-price Powerbeats Pro, at an incredible 15 hours. All for $149.95.

I hate to sound like I was held by Tim Cook at gunpoint here, but I just wanted to start some talk about these things. As someone heavily considering the Airpods pro, these have drawn my attention and they could not have been announced at a better time for me. Especially considering they sound a lot better than both pro models. 

So there you have it. In my personal opinion, they are the best bang for your buck if you have an iPhone. Great sound quality, very reasonable price and incredible battery life.

What’s your opinion on these guys?",0,1584521989,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fkmjuy/the_new_powerbeats_4_seem_too_good_to_be_true_and/,apple,1

fjirsi,greatmeatballsoffire,Poor customer service experience,"I just had one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever had the displeasure of going through. Not sure what my options are now, grateful for any views. I am being as honest as I can about my attitude going through this, as I don't want to give the impression that I was an angel throughout the whole process, but I will say that as it went on, my frustration with the experience led me to getting more snappy with the staff that I spoke to. 


The story begins here. Apologies for the long wall of text. 


I purchased an iPad for my partner on 11 Nov 2019. It came with the free one year Apple TV+ subscription. I did not realise this had to be activated within 3 months of purchase, and I essentially forgot about it. I didn't receive the reminders because the iPad was registered under my partner's name so the reminders went to her email. I accept that up to here, this is all my fault. 


I realised in early March 2020 that the deadline to register for the free Apple TV+ subscription had passed. The deadline would have been some time in early Feb (not sure if its 3 months or 90 days, I've been told a number of different things by the various Customer Support people I spoke to), so I missed it by a few weeks to a month. 


I decided to contact Apple Support. This was on 7 March. I did so via the Apple Support chat link, so it was a live chat with one of the CS staff. I was, at this point, very apologetic. I said I knew it was my fault that I had missed the deadline to sign up, but since it was only a few weeks, was there something that could be done? I admit that at this point, I thought it would be a very routine encounter - someone would admonish me for missing the deadline, activate the one year subscription, and that would be that. This was not the case. 


The CS Rep (Rep #1) I spoke to said he would do his best to assist. He asked when I had purchased the device, and for proof of purchase. I gave him the date, but said that I was not able to find the receipt. I said that the device had been registered on 11 Nov 2019, which was the day I had bought the iPad - wouldn't that be sufficient? He said no, unfortunately there was nothing he could do until I found the physical receipt, and that I had to find it before he could assist me. He suggested contacting the store that I'd purchased the device from to ask for a copy. He gave a case number so I could follow up once I found the receipt, and I said I didn't really see how it made a difference, but ok. The conversation ended there. I don't have a log of the conversation with Rep #1, but my understanding at this point was that if I found the receipt, there wouldn't be any issue and he'd grant an extension and I receive my one year. So I went to search for the receipt for quite some time, couldn't find it, and decided to give up. 


The next week - 16 March - I had a free day, so I decided to follow his advice and go to the shop which I had bought the iPad from. Thankfully, they managed to locate my purchase and printed out another copy of the receipt for me. I then contacted customer support again using the follow-up case number that Rep #1 gave me. I was put in touch with Rep #2. I provided him the receipt. 


After going through the previous conversation with Rep #1, Rep #2 told me that there was nothing he could do - there was no policy for extending the 3 month sign-up period. I said I was surprised, because my understanding from Rep #1 was that he could assist once I found the receipt. Based on that, I had searched my entire house, and then made a special trip to the store to get the receipt. Rep #2 said there was nothing he could do and apologised. Now I was starting to get frustrated, because this was entirely different from what Rep #1 had told me, and if so, I wouldn't have spent time to go get the receipt. After further back and forth, he said the best he could do was to offer 3 months free trial. I asked if he would be able to reach some middle ground, and activate the one year from 11 Nov 2019 - so I wouldn't be getting any extra time from my own mistake. He said there was nothing, and the best he could offer was 3 months. 


To add on to my current annoyance, Rep #2 was, honestly, a bit of a mess and kept making mistakes. First, halfway through the conversation, he apologised for not being to accede to my request for signing up for ""AppleCare"". This was after 30 minutes talking to him about Apple TV+. He quickly apologised for the typo after I asked if there was a misunderstanding. Then, after going off to speak to a supervisor, he came back and said - I have checked and you ""are eligible for the one year"". I was of course elated - but then the next part of his message made clear it was a typo, and he actually meant I was NOT eligible. I was honestly very annoyed at this point. I accept that people make typos. But these were obviously wrong and made me feel as if he was not taking the issue seriously. I asked if I could speak to someone else. I admit that I started getting quite cross at this point and it was apparent from my messages that I was annoyed. 


He assured me that 3 months was the maximum, but referred me to his supervisor, Rep #3. Long story short, Rep #3 said he could only agree to 3 months, and that no one else would be able to offer anything better. I said fine, is there anyone else I can speak to? He gave me a helpline number to call. This seemed odd, as it was a general helpline, so I asked who that line would go to and how they could assist? He essentially said - no they won't be able to assist, but since you wanted to speak to someone else, I gave you the number. This really annoyed me. 


I asked for an alternative feedback avenue, and he gave me a link. I clicked on that link, which took me out of the CS Chat and ended the session, so there was no way for me to go back. At the link, I realised that it was a generic feedback for iTunes support, which seemed entirely wrong to me. I couldn't go back to Rep #3, so I started a new chat - this is Rep #4 - and asked how I could make a complaint about the interaction I had previously. Rep #4 offered to put me in touch with her supervisor. 


So Rep #5. This came after 2 hours of trying to sort out the matter, and I'd honestly given up by now. I told #5 that I was trying to make a complaint about the previous few reps I had spoken to, but the link I had been given did not seem to be the appropriate place as it was for iTunes feedback. She assured me that I could use that link, but said that the 2 other options available were for me to make the complaint to her and she would refer it to the appropriate channel; or else, I could send a letter by post to a certain address. I said I really didn't see the purpose in sending a letter by post, and the other feedback link did not seem appropriate, so I would set it out in that chat and she could escalate it appropriately. 


I typed out a shorter version of what I've detailed above. I admit that it was a wall of text, but it started getting obvious after each message I sent that she was trying to end the conversation there and it did not seem that she was taking my complaint seriously. She kept asking, after each section, whether that was all, and if so, she would end the chat. After setting out my overall complaint and explaining why I was frustrated thus far, I said to her that I accepted that I was out of the sign up period, but whether this was something they could consider waiving given the circumstances. I summarised that I felt that I had wasted my time given Rep #1's response, then my complaint that Reps #2 and #3 seemed unprofessional. I repeated my request for one year commencing from 11 Nov 2019. 


To my surprise, she essentially said that I had been offered 3 months already, she and no one else at Apple were under no obligation to offer anything further and I would not receive any additional offer. She then said that, I paraphrase, ""it's obvious to me that you are not happy with the 3 months I'm offering you. That's your choice. I will be ending this chat here and will forward your complaint. Have a nice day.""


And that was that. She closed the chat, and I have no further way to respond. I was in fact still typing when she closed the chat, and I think it would have been clear to her that I was still typing because I could see when she was typing a message. Honestly, I don't even care about the Apple TV+ subscription anymore. But I am honestly appalled at the way in which this was handled. I feel that Rep #5 showed obvious disregard and annoyance with my complaint – when she was the one who offered that chat as an official avenue for complaint – and I do not expect her to forward my complaint to anyone. 

I want to be fair so I thought I’d summarise my general attitude here. I was polite with Rep #1, and admitted numerous times it was my fault. I made clear to Reps #2 to #4 that I was annoyed, and I accept that my tone in the messages could have been better, but I don’t think that I was rude. I did make it clear to Reps #2 and #3 that I thought they were being unprofessional and that the general way this was being handled was poor. By the time I reached Rep #5, I was simply trying to make a complaint, and did so because she told me that I should type the complaint to her in that chat. I don’t think my tone was rude or that I overstepped, and again, I made clear to her that I thought her previous colleagues had handled the matter poorly – only to suddenly get cut off in that way. 

I am not sure what my options are now. Actuually, I honestly don’t care about the subscription anymore, but this isn’t the customer service I expected to receive.

fji0z9,JimmyK1995,Apple refusing to give me a refund for Logic Pro X.,"Yeah so after spending more than 10K on Apple products the last few years, I am done.   


I bought Logic Pro X. In Denmark where I live we have 14 days return right, it's a part of our buyer protection policy.   
Logic Pro X is the worst program ever. I'm on a 13"" MacBook Pro. You can't change the resolution in Logic Pro, which means that everything is super huge. Sure I could change the resolution on my pc back and forth, but I am constantly browsing the internet while making music so that's quite a hassle.   


Furthermore it fucks up my CPU, and the workflow generally is really bad. The UX is insanely flawed. Such as when I have to change between the pointer and the pencil, instead of just doing double click to add notes like any other DAW.   
So I called Apple, hoping for a solution. For me the 200 dollars is more symbolic, I don't want to pay for something that I do not enjoy. Something that I have deleted and won't spend my time using. 

Apparently Apple does not refund software purchases, you have to look that information up yourself, or read through 35 thousand lines of text in the license agreement.   


They could not make an exception. I explained them that the program was pretty much unusable for me. And that I had spend +10K on Apple products the past few years which they can verify.   


Never buying an Apple product again, and I encourage anyone in my network to refrain from supporting such a company.",17,1584349598,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fji0z9/apple_refusing_to_give_me_a_refund_for_logic_pro_x/,apple,1

She tried to get me to live with the problem, but I insisted on replacing it.  They didn’t have any in stock to swap on the spot.  She also said if I waited closer to the end of warranty, I would come out better given the refurbs you get have a 90 day warranty. So I’ll be going back in late April.

fiw5gy,Maxzamora,"I'm inches away from recovering a stolen iPhone, need urgent advice","Hello everyone, I will gladly give context:

My iPhone was stolen about 26 hours ago, and after a friend suggested I kept an eye out for market sites (facebook, etc), about 3 hours ago I found a listing of my iPhone model on one site.

I have been able to confirm without a doubt that the phone listed is mine, because the thief didn't remove the protective film, and when I got my phone, I had the film installed in the carrier's store. Thankfully, the person that installed it did a poor job and my OCD has been suffering from an iPhone protective film that is incorrectly placed a bit to the right of the screen's outline, for an entire month, before it being stolen.

The picture in the listing shows my iPhone model with the same film, so I'm 110% sure that it is my phone.

The website gives you the seller's phone number, so I contacted them 2 hours ago and after being asked about any receipts of purchase, they said they didn't have any as they were lost since the phone ""was purchased from abroad"".

I'm planning to go to the police with all this information (including the phone's Serial and IMEI numbers) but the following actions are a bit unclear.

What do the people of /r/apple recommend? If the police were not to agree to accompany me to ""buy"" the iPhone from the hands of the seller based on just the ""protective film"" claim, how could I convince the seller to give me the IMEI/Serial number so I can prove that it is in fact my phone?",0,1584248033,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fiw5gy/im_inches_away_from_recovering_a_stolen_iphone/,apple,1

fij6ot,SocialIssuesAhoy,"If you are subscribed to Apple Music, try asking to play ""my station""!","I love listening to my entire music library on shuffle; I always have. But with a library of 6,000+ tracks, an increasing number of them are things that I don't actually want to listen to except in special cases. There's a lot of Christmas music that I always have to skip, some spoken audio, classical music, stuff from work, and then a bunch of music that I can't bring myself to remove for sentimental reasons but I'm still not interested in listening to most of the time.

I don't remember how I stumbled across this but it seems to be the best-kept feature of Apple Music because I can't find anything about it so I wonder how many others know about it: it's just called ""my station"" or  ""[your name]'s station"". I can never find it anywhere in the interface itself but asking Siri (or Alexa if you have Apple Music added there) to play it will bring it up reliably. If you can't tell where I'm going with this... I LOVE this station and I now use it for 99% of my music listening. Here's why:

1. It largely plays music that's already in my library, although I think it's technically still pulling them directly from Apple Music because I don't think I've ever heard it play anything that wouldn't be available to stream. I would say around to 75% of the content is music that I already know/have.

2. It NEVER plays the music that I would skip anyway. I don't think I used the station close to Christmas but at least outside of the Christmas season it never goes to holiday music.

3. It gently introduces me to new music that's in line with what I already love. New music by the same artists, new artists that are similar. I would say that I like literally 99% of the music it adds, unlike Pandora which might be the service I'm familiar with that's most similar.

4. It does a great job with variety. Again contrasting this with Pandora, where one station would seem to get stuck in little loops. Having listened to this station for countless hours I can vouch for its ability to keep things fresh.

5. It has a pleasant way of phasing through genres. Several tracks in a row will be ""of a kind"", but then it will move on. It's timed really well; in general listening it's just the right amount of time in a genre without becoming a genre station, but if there's something you really don't feel like listening to at the moment (like sometimes mine ends up on contemporary piano instrumental music), you can easily skip ahead a few times and you'll be somewhere new.

Sorry if this is all already well-known and I'm just oblivious, but as someone who has never had any strong feelings about Apple Music one way or the other this is a fantastic feature. It's so refreshing to have a feature that matches my needs so perfectly, hopefully you'll find the same!",58,1584196155,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fij6ot/if_you_are_subscribed_to_apple_music_try_asking/,apple,1

fie4ow,Caitie1996,Apple Education Promotion and Returns/Swapping (Australia),"Hi Everyone, 

I'm just wondering if anyone knows if I purchase a macbook air and get the 'free headphones', and decide I actually need the macbook pro if I am able to exchange/return the air (pay the difference) and keep the headphones even if the promo has ended. Also how does it work if I also purchase apple care+, do I just pay the difference in cost between the air and pro? Sorry, it's my first apple purchase and I'm not 100% sure which one I need/want (like the look of the air but might need the power of the pro). 

Thank you :)",0,1584166785,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fie4ow/apple_education_promotion_and_returnsswapping/,apple,1
fidxqo,scooooba,IPhone backup storage question,"Hey all, I have some questions about how backups work with IPhone and ICloud. 

I’ve had my first iPhone (iPhone X) for a while now, and the default storage of 5GB on iCloud. I own no other apple devices such as a Mac. 

Around November, I started getting notifications there wasn’t enough storage to backup my iPhone anymore. At the time my backup size was probably around 2.5GB. I tried deleting my current backup to see if the space would be available after. Also, I have about 2.3GB in photos (of which I don’t have an obnoxious amount, literally all of my dog who passed in December. ) Since I’ve been fiddling with my storage, I’ve basically only chose to backup core information such as contacts and calendars, as well as my photos. All other apps are disabled. 

I’ve been trying to create a new backup since, and though I haven’t taken really any new photos since my last backup, and every other app is disabled, my iphone backup now stands at about 4.2 GB, still only using 2.3 GB for photos. Every app I download I turn off the option to back it up with my phone. 

Sorry for the long background but I wanted to get all the info in I can think of. So my question is where is all this extra size coming from? Roughly the same data size needed for my photos but my backup size has nearly doubled.",0,1584165583,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fidxqo/iphone_backup_storage_question/,apple,1

fhwlgp,puig6695,Powerbeats 3 Warranty,"I bought a pair of Powerbeats 3 in May 2019 that had been giving me trouble recently and now have completely died on me.  I had the Powerbeats 2 and BeatsX before, both of which died after using them for roughly a year.  My Powerbeats 3 were fine until a month or two ago, when they started randomly turning off and giving me the blinking light.  They'd reconnect after a few seconds, but would continue to shut off randomly.  They completely died tonight and there is no light even when I plug them in.  

So my question regarding the warranty is this - will Apple replace the pair for free or will there be some cost?  I suspect they're damaged from sweat (despite being marketed as sweat-proof) which I'm not sure is considered a manufacturing defect or damage caused by the consumer.  I've read differing reports online, some saying they'll be replaced for free and some saying for somewhere between $79-$100.  I've finally learned my lesson and will be buying a new pair of non-Beats earbuds, but if I can get these fixed/replaced for free I would still do it.  I have the original box with the serial number, but don't have the original receipt.  I bought them at Best Buy in-store and they are able to print a new receipt if I bring the credit card I used to the customer service desk.

Another issue I saw on a forum was that the 1-year warranty starts when the retailer purchases them, not the consumer.  If this is true, it's very possible they went to the shelf March 2019 and sat for two months before I bought them, which would mean it's been over 1 year.  The wording in [this](https://www.apple.com/legal/warranty/products/accessory-warranty-english.html) makes me think I'm not covered under warranty, but I'm really not sure.  Just wanted to seek some advice before I go get the receipt from Best Buy and then stand in line at the Apple Store.",0,1584089381,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fhwlgp/powerbeats_3_warranty/,apple,1

fhva9m,apk0377,Questions by a university student about the Apple ecosystem,"I am about to join a college and I am thinking of using the Apple Ecosystem for my studies. Taking notes, making projects on photoshop, video editing, etc. I really can't afford spending 1000 bucks on everything as I'm in college so here are a few questions.

Right now, I have the iPhone 8 and an Apple watch series 3. I just wear the watch all day however I am in no mood of buying a new watch for the next few years. The question comes about the phone.

**Question 1 - How long can my iPhone 8 serve me if I don't update it after iOS 13, take proper care of it with a case and all ? I really cannot afford to buy the 11 right now.**

So next up is my laptop. I have a Lenovo laptop that cannot run Photoshop (it is pretty old). And I love doing photoshop and video editing. I was thinking of the 2012 Macbook pro or the 2018 Macbook air. The 2012 MBP seems to be better in terms of price.

**Question 2 - Can the 2012 MBP serve me for the next 3-4 years? I just want it for photoshop, video editing and notes taking. Or should I buy the 2018 MB Air?**

And now the last one. I have to buy myself an iPad too. But some kids in my high school use an iPad as their laptop, as an alternative.

**Question 3 - Can the iPad Air serve as a good laptop alternative? I know it can't do photoshop and video editing but if there is some alternatives?**

Thanks for answers.

And yeah, another question (if you want to answer) - 

**Should the Apple ecosystem be a right choice for a college student who wants to spend less, and have the longest use of the products (4-5 years). Or should I opt for the google alternative?**",0,1584080691,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fhva9m/questions_by_a_university_student_about_the_apple/,apple,1

fhe0ji,dreamonbaby07,Apple doesn't care for it's employees,"I'm a Tier 2 Mac advisor for Apple and I'm employed by a third party. Technically and legally I'm not working for Apple but for my company, Teleperformance Albania for more than two years now.
We are in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak and they are refusing us not going to work even if we might have a doctor's notice in case we're high risk for the virus. 
The only measures that they have taken is to put some hand sanitizer when we enter the building. 
The room I work with my colleagues has 100 people inside and there isn't a good AC for the air at all. On top of this we cannot work from home because of logistics and security. 
So much for a company that values its clients' security but not its employeeses health. 
I know that legally Apple doesn't recognize me as an employee but they're the ones that interviewed me for the job, they're fixing my schedule, they're training me for new products and they're the ones telling who gets to have a monthly bonus or not. 
The only thing TP Albania provides are apparently the building and people to be spared.
My colleagues in Rome are still working for God's sake when Italy is practically a no-go zone and everyone is staying at home. 
Yesterday they denied a pregnant college of mine a doctor's notice saying that she couldn't come at work and needed to stay home. What did they do? 
They fucking threatened her that if she doesn't come she won't be able to take the pregnancy leave anymore and thus practically getting fired. 
I know that many big companies hire third parties especially for this types of reasons but don't try to be a nice guy when you're not. Apple=Hypocrite. They need to check which companies they hire for outsourcing.

A few years back Google had something called ‘make mobile friendly’ — it’d shrink data and optimize pages on the fly. It’s been gone awhile.

We cant afford unlimited data plans, so finding a service like this again would be a godsend.

fgd3oi,sharjeels,Opinion: the battery on iPhone 11 pros is great. Beyond great that 90% of the time I end my day with 20% left. But there are still days when using camera or too much time in the sun (high brightness) I manage to kill it even after turning on low power mode.,Now most android phones have this feature( one thing I like of android) that you can change resolution on your phone. It’s very unlike Apple to give that option but I wish they did that whenever you turned on low-power mode. Screen would go to 1080 from near 2k screen pros have. Hope they do something similar with iOS 14.  Battery life would be more amazing!,9,1583843609,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fgd3oi/opinion_the_battery_on_iphone_11_pros_is_great/,apple,1
fgd1yo,crptgd,Almost 2100 charging cycles. Now my macbook doesn't want to charge anymore. What would you recommend doing?,"Hey, i have a mid 2012 MacbookPro 13"" with 8gb Ram rocking a 500gb HDD and an i5.

I had a Problem 2 years ago where my MBP got really slow and changing the connecting cable to my hard drive worked like a charm.

The laptop is really old and vot used quite frequently.

I managed to get 2000+ charging cycles out of that battery which is impressive considering some only make it up to ~1000.

Today my laptop stopped charging. I cleaned the MagSafe port with alcohol and qtips and used the

""Shift+Control+Option+Power"" function afterwards to reset the energy settings.

Nothing worked so far.

I actually don't really mind so much but i would love to get my data out at least.

What would you do? How would you go about saving the data? How would you try to make it work again?

Just replace battery?

Any suggestions are welcome!

fg9jpa,codyamaroo,System Restore after Apple ID E-Mail Change,"Having a weird issue and wanted to see if any of you have experienced similar.. Sorry in advance for the long post.

Background: Two weeks ago, in a random fit of ""I hate Google Services,"" I changed the e-mail associated with my Apple ID from my gmail address (which has been my Apple ID forever) to my rarely-used iCloud address. Same Apple ID - I just edited the primary e-mail address associated with it. 

Yesterday, was trying to wipe my HD and reinstall MacOS in preparation of selling my MacBook Pro (2019 16"" Model). Deactivated Find My Mac and all the usual steps. Everything was proceeding as usual. 

However, when it came time to erase the drive in the system restore disk utility, I received the ""Turn off  Find My Mac"" prompt after I clicked 'erase.' BUT: the e-mail listed in this prompt was the OLD gmail address associated with my Apple ID, not the current iCloud address that is my current login. 

Thinking nothing of it, I tried to enter my password (which has NOT changed between the switch from gmail to iCloud Apple ID), and it threw it back as invalid. Changed my password, thinking maybe it would update it or something, and it still came back as incorrect. Long story short - I was unable to wipe my hard drive, and spent an hour and a half on the phone with Apple to try to troubleshoot. 

The tech tried to troubleshoot. Managed to erase the data on the ""Macintosh HD - Data"" volume which left me with no OS, and no way to wipe the drive and start again. Said I needed to take it into an Apple store.

Did so this evening - spent two hours there with one of their guys. He had me login to both Find My Mac and the Apple ID management page to delete the device from both. Reboot the MBP, and voila - I can now format the drive without a password prompt.

But, upon going through Mac OS setup - the ""Find My Mac"" page is AUTOFILLED with my old gmail address. Even after the hard drive wipe. Even after deleting device from Apple ID AND Find My Mac. I was even setting up WITHOUT entering or creating an Apple ID at that prompt in OS X setup. 

Further - after doing this, the MBP once again showed up in my devices in Find My Mac. Tried to format/reinstall two more times. Same thing. 

Tech was baffled - said that logging it into them wouldn't do much good, as they would only repeat what we had already tried. Said it MIGHT have something to do with the T2 chip and Catalina. Suggested I call back into the phone support line.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m thinking I lost my AirPods or they were stolen from work this past weekend,

The find my phone app is showing that they were last connected at my desk in the office Friday 3/6 at 3:30pm. The question here is, if someone stole them and connected them for themselves would my find my app still be showing the last place my pods were? Or would they completely be erased from my find my app as if they were never connected for me at all?

Sorry if this is an old question I’m just trying to see if I should just cut my losses but if they are only showing last position due to not being reconnected I still have hope in finding them.

ff6dz8,ChiliLion,I made an app to track your time and see where it goes. Feedback appreciated!," Hi everyone!  I've always wondered what all my time is spent doing. Every time I set out to complete a task, it always takes me more time than I expect, even though I feel like I've been working hard nonstop. I started using notecards to track my time spent working, and found out that over 50% of my time is wasted! But using notecards was such a hassle, and I couldn't view any in-depth statistics. So, I created an app to track time.  The basic premise of the app is that you create categories and use a timer to keep track of how much time you spent on each category. The timer does not run in the background, so leaving the app in the background does not drain the battery. You can also use the app as a planner, and you can add in assignments and events, with alarms to alert you.  The app is **completely free** and all data is **locally stored**. There is no signup: we do not take any emails or passwords.  Any and all feedback is appreciated!

ff4wvk,ConsciousTiger4,What would sleep mode even do?,"I keep reading these articles where people claim that the Apple watch needs a sleep mode.  Why?  What exactly would Apple's sleep mode do that the thirds party apps don't?

First of all, let's address the elephant in the room.  No watch tracks sleep.  They track heart rate, O2 levels, movements, user input, and noise.  That's all.  They don't track sleep at all. 

Don't get me wrong.  I really love Sleepwatch and AutoSleep but both apps estimate my sleep time, they don't really track it.  Frankly, I enjoy both programs and find them useful in helping me maintain good sleep hygiene.  In addition, I'm one of these strange people who just enjoy looking at the data and I enjoy the graphs, charts, reports and overall presentation.  Don't judge me.  LOL

So why does anyone believe that Apple's version of sleep tracking is necessary or would be any better than Sleepwatch?  Would Apple add some sort of deep brain scan that could accurately predict the moment I fell asleep and woke up?  Of course not.  Sometimes I'm half asleep in the early morning and I can't even tell if I'm awake or not.  How would Apple know?

I get the feeling that this demand for Apple to introduce sleep tracking is simply hype.  It has no real value.  The only reason journalists even talk about it is so they have something to write about.",0,1583629692,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/ff4wvk/what_would_sleep_mode_even_do/,apple,1

I tried using Mojave and high Sierra as well and still get the same error codes. I’ve tried to get back into contact with the guy, but no answer or responses. Called Apple a few times to see it they could help and they’re not willing to without a receipt. Even went as far as calling repair shops and Apple authorized repair centers and no one can help.

ff0hjf,Chibow,HELP: just got a FaceTime call from my GF while she was in bed next to me NOT FaceTiming me,"Long time lurker and needed to enlist some of your expertise. My Gf and I moved to Vietnam a few months ago and we got new SIM cards and phone numbers when we arrived. We both updated our Apple ID info and removed our old numbers and added the new ones to our FaceTime profiles. 

About a week ago, I FaceTimed her when she misplaced her phone (she was right next to me at the time). To our surprise, it was answered and the other party was a woman that didn’t speak English. We suspect it was a Vietnamese woman. The call was quickly dropped but when we checked her phone, it showed that the call was answered on another device. The freaky thing was we heard her phone ring and her MacBook ring when I called and we double checked the devices linked to her profile: just her iPhone 11 max and MacBook. 

We called back via FaceTime a few times and it was declined. 

We immediately changed her passwords and confirmed that she didn’t have any device logins. We chalked it up to a glitch. 

Fast forward to 20 minutes ago: I was just browsing on my phone in bed and she was next to me on her MacBook. I got a FaceTime call from her!!!! I answered it and this time it sounded like a male speaking Russian or some Eastern European language that quickly hung up. I immediately called back and it was answered again where there was background (tv perhaps?) of the same dialect. All calls were all unanswered going forward. 

Any thoughts to this? We are a little freaked since there haven’t been any logins online nor any devices being added. 

Thank you for your help!

ff06u7,Shihab_8,Launched an update for my color-picker iOS and macOS app with live camera picker support (Giving away promo codes) 🥳,"Hey Reddit!

I'm back with more promo codes to give away for my app Aurora after taking all the feedback and suggestions onboard from last time and improving the app further. Namely, I've added more localizations/languages, and added a live screen picker for the macOS app to pick colors from anywhere in the screen (the most requested feature).

A month ago I launched a beautiful iOS and macOS color-picker and dictionary app called Aurora that contains the ability to find color details, pick colors from the camera and images, replace colors in images, save colors, view their related palettes, CSS, Obj-C, and Swift code snippets, and more. It also has a Watch app and a Today Extension widget.

The iOS app can be found over at: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aurora-color-picker/id1493055655?ls=1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aurora-color-picker/id1493055655?ls=1)

The macOS app can be found over at: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aurora-color-picker/id1495998489?ls=1&amp;mt=12](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aurora-color-picker/id1495998489?ls=1&amp;mt=12)

It has since been featured on [9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/02/02/color-picker-for-iphone/), [iDownloadBlog](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2020/01/29/aurora-color-picker-app/), and [AppAdvice](https://appadvice.com/post/find-the-perfect-hue-with-the-new-color-picker-aurora/1493055655/1241081514), along with being included in various lists on the App Store such as 'New Apps We Love'.

I mentioned it here back when it first launched, but I'm now back with more promo codes. Reply to this post for the chance to win a free copy of both the iOS and macOS versions of Aurora! (I will PM 10 random people)

fewx1z,nevertakenusername,I made an app to track your time and and see where it goes. Feedback appreciated!,"Hi everyone!

I've always wondered what all my time is spent doing. Every time I set out to complete a task, it always takes me more time than I expect, even though I feel like I've been working hard nonstop. I started using notecards to track my time spent working, and found out that over 50% of my time is wasted! But using notecards was such a hassle, and I couldn't view any in depth statistics. So, I created an app to track time.

The basic premise of the app is that you create categories and use a timer to keep track of how much time you spent on each category. The timer does not run in the background, so leaving the app in the background does not drain battery. You can also use the app as a planner, and you can add in assignments and events, with alarms to alert you.

The app is **completely free** and **all data is locally stored.** There is no signup: we do not take any emails or passwords.

Any and all feedback is appreciated!

fevaoo,armageddon_20xx,Introducing Schedule Us: A new way to schedule get-togethers,"App store link: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id1496235856](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1496235856) \[US ONLY\]

Available on iPhone and iPad.

Website link: [schd.us](https://schd.us)

Schedule Us allows you to schedule a get-together with your friends or party. It is different than other apps out there that do the same thing:

1. There is a built-in location finder that can find a place for the event to happen - this populates the address in the event for ease of scheduling.
2. The app optionally allows users to integrate their Google Calendar and the system will look at all of the calendars and pick a time that doesn't conflict
3. Picking an invitation image or setting up a poll is not required
4. You can pick from your contacts on your phone to populate your event
5. Attendees can reply with a ""Y"" or ""N"" to respond, they don't need to click on a link

The app is free to use for up to three times per month. An account with a valid US phone number is required to use this app. As of now there are no promo codes, but there may be in the future. 

The public release of Schedule Us was only a few days ago, so this app is really brand new. It took 8 months to build and test. 

As it is new and r/apple are going to be some of the first users outside of people I know that is going to use it, I am looking for a lot of feedback to help improve this app. Your feedback will be considered for the next major release at the end of this month. Please drop suggestions in the comments. 

While I had a team of people testing this for months, given how big this app is, there are likely to be some minor bugs. Please report these in the comments. 

If I use your suggestion, and I do implement promo codes, then I will DM you a promo code for a premium account sometime in the future (this will not happen straight away)

ferbkk,nstrm,My indie app Liftin’ Workout Tracker has gotten som big updates this winter including support for notes. I’m giving away 50 promo codes if you want to try it! 🥳,"Hello r/Apple! 👋

I’m the developer of [Liftin’ Workout Tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/liftin/id1445041669), a gym app for iPhone and Apple Watch focused on design and ease of use. I have released some big updates this winter. 

If you want a promo code, send me a message! Leave the comments for discussion and feedback. 

##What’s new in Liftin’ 

+ **Notes**

Support for adding notes to your exercises has been highly requested and it is finally completed! You can now easily add and edit notes during workout to scribble down machine settings or your current form.

For the Apple Watch app I have integrated the amazing FlickType keyboard which makes text input really easy!

+ **Trisets and Giant sets**

Last year I added support for supersets, but many of pointed out to me that you want to track more than just two exercises in parallel. I have updated the app so you can connect any number of exercises and track them with alternating sets.

+ **..and more:**

+ Visual indication when auto progression system has adjusted weights. 
+ Equipments can be marked as unavailable which filters out exercises requiring those. 
+ Also added a bunch of olympic weightlifting exercises with illustrations to built in list. 

Unfortunately I had to remove the links to bodybuilding.com exercise database since they have locked it behind a subscription service. I’m looking for an alternative source for information as a replacement. 

Big thanks to everyone who are using Liftin’ and sending me feedback! You help me make the app better! 🙏

feq89r,vousnemevoyezpas,Share My Experience of Connecting a 4K Monitor to an Older MacBook,"In this post, I will share my recent experience of connecting a 4K monitor to an older MacBook. The reason why I write this post is because I have done a lot of research when trying to do this, and I believe there are still many people who are using older MacBooks (mainly models before 2015), so I think this may be helpful, and save you a lot of time and money.

The MacBook I use is the 11-inch MacBook Air Mid 2012, and the monitor is the LG 27UL500-W. I think this will work with any MacBooks with Thunderbolt connectivity (any generation) and a monitor with DisplayPort input. By the way, I'm on the latest Catalina.

Starting with some background story, I was looking for a 1080p monitor at that time to connect with my MacBook, just to do some minor productivity work. The model under my watch was Dell U2419HC, as it has USB-C connectivity, which I may use it with my new iPad Pro randomly. However, I ended up buying this 4K monitor mentioned above on sale, for under $300, which was a great deal. I guess it is just more future-proof.

My MacBook only has a Thunderbolt 1 port, which theoretically supports only 10 Gbps. Plus, it only has Intel HD Graphics 4000. However, there are a few posts which some folks say 4K is possible.

Then I jumped on board, and studied the ports of my monitor. It has two HDMI 2.0 and a DisplayPort 1.4. Basically, HDMI has lower speed, but with the 2.0 version, it is capable of doing 4K at 60 Hz. DisplayPort will have higher speed, and it is more compatible when connecting laptops.

Next, choosing the right cable was the most painful part for me. Obviously, there is a lot of marketing stuff going on, which confuses people very often. For example, some cables will state as ""active"", or some will say they have more features than others. None of these are quite true. Here is what I found on the official website of DisplayPort, a body who regulates the standards. 

[https://www.displayport.org/cables/how-to-choose-a-displayport-cable-and-not-get-a-bad-one/](https://www.displayport.org/cables/how-to-choose-a-displayport-cable-and-not-get-a-bad-one/) 

By all means, as long as the cable is bought from a legit marketplace, it has all the features and capabilities. 

I tried the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter from Belkin, which meant to support 4K on the box. It didn't work. The resolution was capped to 1080p, but the quality was good, like something normal you will get on a 27-inch 1080p display. Then I downloaded SwitchResX, a software that modifies and customises your resolution. It turned out I could upscale to 1440p, but with very blurry fonts. Still no 4K support. I uninstalled the software, returned the adapter and just bought a Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable from a local supply store. It worked, magically. Although, the refresh rate was capped at 30 Hz, the resolution was so much better.

I know some people will say it is super lame and lousy to use a monitor capped at 30 Hz, when the majority equips 144 Hz and over, but if you are like me, play console games on TV while only do some productivity work and photo editing with your old MacBook, I think this is awesome. There is some difference, but not so much to get distracted.",8,1583556084,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/feq89r/share_my_experience_of_connecting_a_4k_monitor_to/,apple,1

fepf15,yeldahnilak,Issues with the new iPhone 11 setup,"Quick backstory: I cannot access my current Apple ID. I have spent hours on the phone with Apple support and they cannot reset my password. 

I got a new iPhone 11 today and want to set it up with the transfer process. I have spent more than three hours now trying to get it to transfer but it either gets stuck on setting up Apple ID or on preparing to transfer data. The WiFi connection is good, I’ve rebooted each phone several time, gone through a few online forums, and nothing is working. 

I then tried to set up the iPhone manually, which to do that I had to create a new gmail account and new Apple ID, but then I couldn’t download apps. When I googled why it said to go to settings &gt; general &gt; restrictions- and restrictions isn’t under general? I can’t find restrictions. 

I’m not technologically illiterate, I’m 26 and my husband who’s pretty good with phones and computers was helping me out with this. I’d like to just be able to do the phone to phone transfer but it looks like that won’t happen. Does anyone have any advice here? Should I go to Verizon or the Apple store for help? Please let me know if you need additional info, I tried to provide enough without rambling but happy to clarify if needed.

fedjk7,Norcla,[LONG READ w/ TL;DR] Macbook Pro 16 Review for Business Users: great device but not for all business users,"Hello everyone! I wanted to put together a business-focused review of the MacBook Pro 16. When I was searching for reviews on the MBP 16, most of the reviews were focused on content creation use cases and some focusing on developers. Wrote this up for the business users out there — I hope this helps!

**About Me**

I own and run a small digital &amp; technical transformation consulting firm. My own workflow consists of heavy PowerPoint usage (strategy decks, investment decks, analyses, research, senior executive-level presentations, etc.), Adobe XD (more focused on reviewing &amp; signing off on prototypes developed by my UI/UX team), Excel (financial modeling, financial model reviews), Word (writing/editing/review contracts, proposals, memos, and other documentation), Messaging (email, WhatsApp, Zoom, etc.), and relationship management (client interactions, presentations, workshops, etc.). Due to the nature of my work I’m quite mobile within the day, usually moving between 2-3 locations to meet with clients and their teams. 

**Tech Preferences**  

I generally prefer having the best value in the high-end at the time of purchase — I have a couple of mechanical keyboards (my daily driver is a KBD75 with Kaihl Navy Switches which I use at home), a high-end gaming desktop (Core i7-6700K + GTX 1080 Ti bought in 2017, hopefully business does well so I can upgrade!), and a 34” ultrawide Acer Predator X34. I’m iOS/Android &amp; Windows/Mac agnostic; I’ve heavily leaned towards Windows/Android until the past 2 years. More aligned now with Mac/iOS these days given that my wife is on it. 

**Past MacBook Experience**

I’ve been a Windows ultrabook user until my job switch in January 2018. The company-issued device was a 13” MacBook Pro. I moved to a sister company towards the end of 2018 and requested for a 15” MacBook Pro. When I started my company Q4 last year (2019) I bought myself this 16” MacBook Pro. 

Model Being Reviewed: Base Model MacBook Pro 16 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL;DR**

**Final Thoughts**: By itself, the MacBook Pro 16 is a great device, but it’s not the right laptop for all types of business users. It is an expensive yet effective tool for users that work with workflows that require as much information on-screen at any given time and want to have a desktop-like experience wherever their work takes them. The huge screen armed with the amazing Spaces feature, excellent trackpad, and iCloud will help keep you productive and focused on the tasks at hand. 

**Pros**

* **Form Factor**: Business-friendly aesthetics, solid chassis, size increase imperceptible
* **Screen**: Very readable and perfect for having as much information &amp; usable area on-screen
* **Software &amp; Hardware Usability**: Spaces is a great tool to hack complex workflows, iCloud perfect for switching between devices (regardless of OS), trackpad is the best on a laptop, new keyboard is 'mechanical-like', great microphone
* **Content Consumption**: Screen is great for high-resolution video, speakers the best on a laptop, can handle AAA games on 1080p and older AAA games at 4K

**Cons**

* **Form Factor**: Not recommended for ultra-mobile users or those with shoulder problems
* **Software &amp; Hardware Usability**: Prepare to lose your Microsoft Office shortcut muscle memory if you're used to Windows, Touch Bar still pretty useless, poor camera, must have dongles always
* **Price**: Expensive compared to Windows alternatives (but we all know this already)

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**THE REVIEW**

**Form Factor: Aesthetics, Build Quality, Weight**

Generally, the MacBook Pro in Space Gray looks like very serious machine. Same color throughout the device, looks very professional. No fancy/crazy design elements — bringing this to clients reduce the tendency of being perceived as a nerd/geek (this would be a compliment to me personally, but not so much within the industry). The visceral reaction to when I see someone else pull out the 16” inch device is ‘This guy probably works a lot’. 

The build quality is very solid, stable, and strong, which is to be expected for Apple devices. Plop it down on a desk, and it generally transforms the area in front of you and beside you into a legit ‘work space’. I think this has something to do with the Macbook’s ability to cover up your field of view compared to 13” form factors. You also see &amp; feel so much more ‘working' space beside your hands and wrists. 

Comparing it to my old MacBook Pro 15, the slight increase in size is generally imperceptible, except when you fold and pick it up. And yes, it feels slightly chunkier compared to the previous model it replaces. 

In terms of weight, it’s quite heavy but I’ve learned to deal with it. It's a problem when your role requires you to move around frequently with your laptop in tow - closing, packing, and carrying this becomes a chore. To carry this around comfortably, it’s best to use a backpack (which I do). However, if you use a sling/messenger bag you’re definitely going to feel some pain on the shoulder if you carry this along with documents, chargers, &amp; other personal effects. If you use a briefcase, expect to switch your carrying hand frequently.

Another problem when it comes to mobility is that you'll always need to have a dongle on your person all the time. Most Windows laptops will have an HDMI or VGA port, but the MBP 16 doesn't. Be warned: there have been times where I cause a 10-minute delay in a meeting with a C-level executive because they needed to find me an adaptor.

In summary, this is a solid, stable, and super professional-looking device that comes with a weight penalty (of course YMMV). If you have shoulder problems (e.g. tension headache) or prefer a light device that allows you to conveniently &amp; easily move around, I wouldn’t recommend this device. 

The MBP 16 is best suited for mobile professionals who like/need to do serious/deep work in whatever workspace they may be — its form factor helps you get into the ‘zone’. 

**Screen**

I’m a bit picky with displays - I’ve been spoiled by my 1440p 34” ultrawide. Since I’ve been using my ultrawide display at home, I’ve preferred having screen space more than portability given the productivity gains. 

Readability is top notch, screen can get very bright, and the colors pop. Subjectively, I think this display is even more vibrant than my ultrawide. All in all it’s a nice display to keep your eyes glued to for hours. 

What I find most useful is the space that this screen size affords. I like having at least 2 windows open on screen. Briefly switching to my wife’s MacBook Pro, I found it very hard to configure it to my preference — while you can resize windows to achieve the same configuration, it comes with text/image warping or you have to resize the fonts which makes text harder to read comfortably. 

Some samples of my configuration below: 

[https://imgur.com/wDtnBB4](https://imgur.com/wDtnBB4)

As you can see, super comfortable having a browser open for research, notes, and editing a deck. Shaves off valuable minutes when you’re rushing to push out deliverables for your clients. 

[https://imgur.com/68M0Mno](https://imgur.com/68M0Mno)

I have my iMessage and Franz apps side by side, giving me access to my iMessages, SMS, WhatsApp, and FB messenger after a 4-finger slide. My Zoom and Viber windows are also easily accessible behind the main windows. 

[https://imgur.com/cmsqj7d](https://imgur.com/cmsqj7d)

My mail and calendar configuration allows me to read mail comfortably, check my schedule without extra clicks, and reply easily. Some people may be saying that this is over-optimizing (‘a few clicks more wouldn’t hurt!’), but a big part of my job is orchestration &amp; relationship management, which requires quick &amp; strategic communication. Having X clients with 2-3 projects each, all in different stages, it is very important for me to have as much information on screen so I can communicate with impact in less time &amp; disruption to focus. 

[https://imgur.com/i4CTc9L](https://imgur.com/i4CTc9L)

The bigger screen helps me review and comment on Adobe XD with minimal warping. Makes it easier to imagine it in a full browser. 

[https://imgur.com/7nUncmc](https://imgur.com/7nUncmc)

I can easily review documents side by side for a comparative analysis while still having comments visible. 

The screen and size is excellent overall. If you like optimizing your workflow, having the most usable space, and do semi-creative work, the screen is perfect for your needs. However, if you’re not the type to care about having to switch windows and don’t utilize large-screen productivity hacks, this is not for you. 

**General Usability**  (Software (MacOS, Microsoft Office Suite, iCloud, others) + Hardware (trackpad, keyboard, Touch Bar)) 

Disclaimer: Some of the points that I’ll make here, particularly on software, may apply to Macs in general, and not just for the MBP 16”. This section also comes from a person who uses both Windows and MacOS on a daily basis. 

I believe MacOS, plus its accompanying software and 3rd party versions has its pros and cons. You get some productivity gains and you lose some as well. 

The first feature that I absolutely adore is the very intuitive Spaces functionality. My approach is to make sure that each Space has a specific high-level function. My configuration has a Space dedicated for each: Instant Messaging/Calls (iMessage, Franz, Zoom, Viber), Notes (Evernote), Browser (Chrome with X tabs), Productivity (2 Spaces: Each space has 1 of Excel/Powerpoint/Word + Finder) 

My configuration gives me 2 primary productivity gains: it reduces multiple cmd + tab presses by replacing it with one to two 3-finger swipes and less short-term mental memory usage. 

For the former: unfortunately the cmd + tab function is inferior to Windows’s own alt + tab. Upon pressing cmd + tab, it doesn’t display screenshots of open windows but just shows live programs. However, the Spaces functionality more than makes up for it. If I was to, say, reference another window for something I’m working on, I just have to swipe once or twice to the left or right. If it’s already open, I find it immediately. If I have multiple windows open, I immediately follow up with an upward 3-finger swipe to activate Mission Control. 

For the latter: The core principle behind this is ‘chunking’ and force-multiplied by Spaces. If I need to message somebody, I don’t need to tap the program or cmd + tab and pay attention, derailing  my focus. I just use my habit of swiping to my Messages space where my messenger apps are already front and center. Same with the other use cases. 

iCloud is another feature that I absolutely adore. I’ve been an avid Google Drive user and use Dropbox to keep old files that I’ve been too lazy to port over to iCloud. I haven’t used the desktop client of Google Drive and not a power of Dropbox, but I have a feeling that these cloud storage services are quite similar. What I am about to say about iCloud may also be possible for GDrive and Dropbox, so please disregard my feedback as you see fit. 

iCloud is a big help for my workflow continuity between devices and on the road. It’s simply a drive that just follows me around, no matter what device I use! It’s just so good — when I’m on the office, I’m on my Mac. When I arrive home and still need to put in a few hours, I just sit down on my home desktop and continue working from there. Client calls you saying that he can’t find your latest deck and is about to step into a board meeting in 10mins while you’re in a cab? No problem — head to mail on my iPhone, add file, access iCloud, attach file, and send in less than a minute. Crisis averted! 

iCloud is a product that if well-designed and working properly, is something that you shouldn’t notice. And I’m happy to say that I NEVER notice it. It’s so good. 

The native Mail client is also preferable to me over Gmail. Its first key feature is that it’s service-agnostic - I can have my Gmail, Outlook, and other accounts on one client. Versus Gmail it’s much better in terms of editing since I have problems with its bullet point functionality. If there’s one feature I’d like to add, it's GMail’s Undo Send: that feature has saved me from sending in mistakes or strongly-worded emails many times. 

The biggest negatives in software are the different shortcuts on the Microsoft Office Suite. If you were trained to only use your keyboard for Excel and memorized Powerpoint shortcuts (both on Windows), you’re going to have a hard time. I’ve reached the point where I don’t use Excel with a mouse — everything done on the keyboard. Excel does have some of the intuitive short cuts (cmd + arrow key is equivalent to ctrl + arrow key, etc.), but you’ll have to relearn all the shortcuts. This is made worse by having no dedicated function keys and that the shortcuts are not displayed by hovering the cursor over the buttons.  

On Powerpoint, making quick and refined adjustments via shortcuts (e.g. font resize, using the auto align functions, etc.) is not intuitive.  

Intuitively I’d say that I’m 40-50% slower in Mac Excel while 10-30% slower in Mac Powerpoint (depending on slide complexity) vs. the Windows version. This has relegated the MBP 16” as a review device for spreadsheets — for actual modeling I use my Windows PC. For PowerPoints, the penalty is acceptable for the advantage of being mobile. 

For my own usage, the redeeming factor is the amazing trackpad. Sorry detractors, the MacBook trackpad is the undisputed best trackpad on a laptop so far. It’s very precise and its multi-touch functionality helps offset the problem with shortcuts. Let’s take one of my very common use cases, aligning 2 objects: 

Windows: Drag-select both objects, ALT + JD + AA + R 

MacOS: 2-finger zoom, drag-select both objects, click Picture Format &gt; Align &gt; Align right 

Windows still has the advantage here for me because I’m a touch typist and I can do this across multiple groups mechanically. On MacOS I have to drag my mouse a distance every single time I have to do this across multiple groups, but the precision of the trackpad really helps. 

Going back to the trackpad, it’s amazing. The way that it feels to the touch, the haptic feedback when clicking, the size, feeling of precision, it’s the best! Across my 3 MacBooks, I’ve never had to use a mouse. 

Moving on to the keyboard. I use Kaihl Navy switches on my home mechanical keyboard that require — if I’m not mistaken — double the force needed to actuate vs. cherry switches. I’d say that the MBP 16” keyboard ‘kind of’ feels like a mechanical keyboard. The travel distance of the butterfly keyboards were a problem because I’m a heavy typist - my fingers start to hurt over an extended typing session because the lack of travel makes it feel like I’m heavily tapping a metal plate. 

Comparing this with previous Windows laptop keyboards (my last was the 1st Gen Razer Blade Stealth), this new keyboard is superior. My complaint with the Razer Blade keyboard was that it was mushy and wobbly, probably because I believe it uses a membrane mechanism. The MBP 16” keyboard is very stable and feels consistent even when the key is hit off-center. 

The Touch Bar is the most disappointing component from a hardware perspective. I don’t see its utility and ruins my touch-type workflow because you'll have to look down, away from the screen, to use it. For example, I use option + backspace to erase entire words, which is much quicker than looking at the Touch Bar to use the predictive text function. It looks cool but I’d rather have a set of dedicated function keys. Good thing that the Escape key is now physical. 

Aside from adjusting volume and screen brightness, the only use I’ve had for it is for emojis. This being said, this is the only time I used the Touch Bar for this review: 😂😂😂 

Some other minor thoughts on hardware: webcam is poor and the built-in mic is great. 

**Content Consumption**

Let’s not kid ourselves, even business users need to watch some Youtube and Netflix on their downtime (maybe even play a few rounds of Halo). And this is something that the MBP 16” does well. 

The screen is phenomenal for watching videos. I also appreciate about that the MBP 16 handles 4K content really well. My 13” MacBook struggles with 4K content and it shows by stuttering and heating up. This machine handles it really well with no excessive noise and heat. 

On the gaming side, I haven’t tested it because I’m worried about the productivity hit when I have games on the MBP. I’m more of a AAA gamer but have recently been playing classic shooters and modding them (e.g. Doom, Half Life 2). Since the mentioned games are decades old, this machine will undoubtedly handle it well. For other games, here’s a great Youtube video where the creator tests 7 games on an MBP 16” base model. Looks like it can handle 1080p AAAs and 4K older games on the go. 

Finally, this machine has the BEST speakers in the laptop world right now. I usually listen to rap/EDM/progressive metal while working and when I’m alone in the office, I like crank it up. Bass is great (for a laptop) with no discernible distortion at max volume. It can get quite loud - my guess is that it can go to 60-70% of the max loudness of the Bose Soundlink Mini II. While it can be loud, I’ve noticed that playing music via the Spotify Web Player at \~50% loudness causes a significant battery hit. 

**Final Thoughts**

By itself, the MacBook Pro 16 is a great device, but it’s not the right laptop for all types of business users. While pricing for the specs and form factor is fair, it’s a fact that it is more expensive compared to the base models of Windows alternatives in the category.  

Users that are highly mobile and sensitive to the weight of their backpacks, briefcases, and messenger bags should consider a Windows ultrabook (e.g. XPS 13), MacBook Air, and the MacBook Pro 13.  

If your work primarily revolves around sending emails, building financial models in Excel, and basic Powerpoint &amp; Word, this machine is too expensive to recommend over a Windows ultrabook. 

The MacBook Pro 16 is an expensive yet effective tool for users that work with workflows that require as much information on-screen at any given time and want to have a desktop-like experience wherever their work takes them.

Now because my sister doesn’t have money in her account to do a family plan or whatever, I can’t even pop my music up on her computer just to delete some shit I don’t want.

fdrznr,absource1208,A tech question since Apple refuses to reply,"Some weeks ago, I asked Apple’s European privacy policy team a question. My first email had been ignored, my second replied (but without answering my question) and my reply to them had been ignored completely (waited around 6 weeks now). So I thought maybe you can help me.
It’s about the following case: my wife’s Apple ID is registered in China, while mine is registered in Germany. If I chat with her by using iMessage, I assumed that our conversation can’t be accessed by third parties. But - as far as I understood, my assumption is wrong. According to Apple’s European privacy policy, my backups are saved on a server in Ireland. So far so good - that’s most likely save. But, according to Apple’s Chinese privacy policy, the backups of users with a Chinese Apple ID are stored by Guizhou-Cloud Big Data (GCBD) in China. Additionally, the backups can be accessed by GCBD
“You understand and agree that Apple and GCBD will have access to all data that you store on this service, including the right to share, exchange and disclose all user data, including Content, to and between each other under applicable law.”
So, am I right to assume that the whole iMessage conversation with my wife can be accessed by - at least - GCBD?",0,1583394770,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fdrznr/a_tech_question_since_apple_refuses_to_reply/,apple,1

I’d like to know if there is any way for my iPhone to automatically unlock whenever it’s connected to my Vehicle’s Bluetooth?
Reason being, my vehicle doesn’t allow me to reply to messages but Siri does however the phone needs to be unlocked and obviously I don’t want to touch my phone to unlock it. (Also, I’m not using Apple CarPlay).

fdcq0l,lrnzsmith,A little rant about Apple‘s Iphone Service,"So I‘ve had five Phones my entire life. Started with a Siemens phone, later the Nokia 3510 till i got myself an Iphone 4. I bought that one a second time though (a used model) because battery was done after I guess three and a half years. Off course I noticed software slowing it done too, to a point where it‘s basically unusable (IOS7 - IOS9 gap).


So one and a half year ago I bought a brand new Iphone8 for about € 550. Dropped it yesterday, where despite a case the backside did crack/splinter. Went to the store and they told me replacing the backside panel would cost 450€.

Seriously?

Apple talks about climate neutrality, privacy, Apple Trade-In and stuff, but on the same hand i feel they still try to screw customers if they can do it secretly. Software or hardware wise. I think it‘s a shame.

They claim beeing innovative, „Designed in California“. The claim to want to make the world a better place, but on the same hand stuff like this happens? It‘s all marketing and greenwashing. Was a fool to think they actually want to make a chance for the better, sustainable future.

I am salty. Guess I‘ll let it be than.",0,1583327139,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fdcq0l/a_little_rant_about_apples_iphone_service/,apple,1

Screen goes black for a few seconds and then displays the apple logo. It displays the apple logo for about three seconds, turns off for about three seconds, and turns back on with apple logo and repeats until you force shutdown. When i tried to turn it back on the same thing happens again. Has been doing the same thing for about an hour now. Should i keep it on and wait for the battery to run out and retry then, or will i have to restore it from a mac? or is it something more serious from the hardware? cheers",0,1583320960,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fdblwf/sudden_crash_and_continuous_failure_to_reboot/,apple,1

* Oversized touchpad that forces you to rest your palm on half of it. Not only does it feel weird, but it also makes me feel anxious that my palm will cause the mouse to move slightly (I'm a developer so where the cursor is important).

I had a 3 day stint with the 2016 version when it first came out. I hated it so much, I returned it and bought a 2015 Macbook Pro instead.

I've largely accepted the significant increase in price from the 2015 version and that dongle hell is better in 2020 than it was in 2016. I've also accepted that they chose thinness over battery life and cooling. And they've finally fixed the keyboard.

One reason I’d want to buy a new one is because I’m a neuroscientist and would be interested in upgrading my computer so that I can process neuroimaging data from home. Looking into the new Mac books I noticed that the Max you can get is a 2.4 GHz four core i5 processor. My current Mac book has a 3.1 GHz four core i5 processor. I know that the new macs can do a turbo boost to a higher processing power, but I’m also aware that this will cause additional wear on the laptop. Is the technology improved so that a 2.4 GHz 2020 Mac is going to function better than a 3.1 GHz 2015 Mac? I feel like I’m missing something.

I'm a musician/audio engineer. I've never owned a MacBook before but have an iMac as my main machine. I've been on the lookout for a MacBook for a little while now as I'm moving overseas in three weeks and will need one to continue doing music work while I'm over there.

I've been offered a great deal on a 2.2ghz 6 core i7 15""MacBook Pro, the 2018 model. It's used but eastially brand new with only 14 battery cycles. The price I've been offered is the exact same as the base model 13"" from 2019. The 2.4ghz version of which would be my other option if buying this used MacBook isn't a good choice. I've heard about all the problems with the keyboard etc...and buying tech used makes me nervous because these things are so expensive and if something goes wrong I'm screwed because I'll be in another country.

fbkfro,LiveLifeBeautifully,Safari Across All Devices “Stuck” on WiFi,"I’m so tired of trying to load websites and google searches across all my devices. I have a MacBook Pro 2019, iPad 2017, and iPhone X. Whenever searching on google, web search loading bars just get stuck and says “the server has stopped responding.” I end up turning my WiFi off and back on to fix the issue, but today even that wouldn’t work. Google maps rarely works and even stops loading after searching for a few places. Tried using Firefox, same thing happens. Finally ended up using bing. Worked perfectly fine. 🤷‍♀️

Sometimes the devices don’t even register that I’m searching for something. If I’m open on one webpage, click on the search bar to search for something else, and hit enter the webpage does nothing. Just acts as if I never typed anything new into the search bar. 

I’ve tried turning the devices off then back on, clearing my search and browsing history, clearing my cache. I just don’t know what else to do. 

Help! Please. 

This picture shows how the blue loading bar just gets stuck when hitting enter.

I set up an appointment online and went to the local Apple store this morning. I told the guy what I did and asked if they had any replacement clips. He said it was no problem and he would just go to the back to see if they had some that he could use. He took the keyboard and came back with my key in perfect working order and he even cleaned it with some compressed air.

I’ve found posts with people mentioning that Apple will replace keycaps. Here’s an instance where they also fixed a scissor clip at no charge.

fbffqy,plymouthvan,"Apple watch should have a ""Sick"" mode","I'm one of the people who uses the health and activity functions of my Apple watch religiously every day. I'm currently sick with the flu and so I've adjusted my goals down dramatically to what I can actually accomplish. But the watch doesn't know why and it keeps telling me to get moving, which I find annoying and discouraging. But also, I can't help but feel like the watch should be able to actually help me rest and recover. Like, if I could tell the watch that I'm sick, it could replace some of the normal reminders with actually helpful reminders to drink water or avoid too much activity when it senses I'm doing too much. It could also be doing things like helping me keep track of symptoms and medication. It could also put a hiatus on overall goal tracking. Like, I have some 800 days of perfect rings which is a streak I'm not about to give up because I got sick for a few days; the watch should stop counting goals on sick days and let you maintain your streak. This would also have the added benefit of keeping data about illnesses, how often they happen, how long they lasted, etc.

I love the Apple watch so much during normal life, but it tanks hard when you get sick, and if you're committed to getting the benefit out of the watch, getting sick throws the whole thing off, and that sucks.

What do you think? Do you think you'd like a 'sick mode' for the Apple Watch?",329,1582995738,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fbffqy/apple_watch_should_have_a_sick_mode/,apple,1

fbamc9,BeardmanDaniel,iPhone 11 unlocked and locked,"Hi Guys,

I got an iPhone 11 as a work phone. Thinking it might be locked, i inserted my personal SIM (different carrier) the first time i turned it on. And it worked. Then i put in the work sim and everything was ok.

Few days later i go to my personal provider to get the eSim. I don't want two phones. Then i tried to activate my eSim and it didn't work. 

I tried again to plug in the physical sim (after it was reactivated) and now it says that my iPhone 11 is locked. 

But initially it wasn't. Are they allowed to do this? Is there any way on unlocking my phone? The guy in the store says that is 150E to unlock it.

If it matters, i am in Vienna, Austria. 

Thanks for feedback.",0,1582971423,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fbamc9/iphone_11_unlocked_and_locked/,apple,1

fb8uso,Turtly_Turtle,Apple,"Apple, how dost thou suck? Let me count the ways:

1. iTunes, the worst software in the world.
2. The App Store is a centrally managed walled garden. I can’t run apps Apple hasn’t approved of on my phone, and on my own computer, I have to give special permission to run programs Apple doesn’t like.
3. iCloud is turned on by default.
4. Apple brags about how committed to privacy it is, but gives us no credible way of verifying its claims.
5. I’m forced to use Apple’s default software for several features in iOS such as Siri search.
6. Because Siri works only when you’re online, I have to share my voice commands to my phone over the Internet, commands which Apple records, processes, and saves for a long time.
7. Frequently, Apple’s idea of “easy to use” software requires that I take extra steps, and is not particularly easy to use.
8. Lack of sufficient customization options everywhere. Apple knows best.
9. OSX is based on BSD, which is FOSS, but OSX is proprietary. They’re contemptible free riders.
10. Steve Jobs is dead and mere mortals now run the company.
11. The company makes some really dumb decisions like getting rid of the 3.5mm audio jack.
12. Apple encourages too many push notifications, which, I’ve decided, are an attention-hogging evil.
13. Siri isn’t very good.
14. If they were a decent company, they wouldn’t practice planned obsolescence, and they sure as hell wouldn’t do it so aggressively.
15. Apple Stores just really, really suck in many ways. That’d be another whole list.
16. They’re overpriced. No, not because they’re premium products. When I say they’re “overpriced,” I don’t mean they’re expensive. I mean that they are poor value.
17. Their CEO thinks he has a divine mission to censor wrongthink.
18. They use a new *proprietary* image format (HEIC), if you want to airdrop yourself something from your iPhone to your MacBook. Idiots! Ugh, like I’m *totally* going to get rid of my Mac OS and *this* is the main reason why!

Much of this can be chalked up to the whole wretched, arrogant “Apple knows best” mentality. Why do we still give these people our money?",0,1582959414,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/fb8uso/apple/,apple,1

fb8cd3,sporf,Dell refusing to fix USB-C mac bugs on U3818DW and U3419W monitors,"Dell's U3818DW and U3419W monitors violate USB-C power delivery protocol in a way that causes sleep/wake bugs with USB-C macs. Dell is refusing to address the issue claiming ""Dell does not test or validate on Apple computers"" even though many mac users have reported the issue and shown it is a Dell USB-C bug and not mac specific. This is such a common issue that a top review for the U3419W on Amazon is a 1-star ""[NOT MacBook Pro / Air Compatible!!!! Do Not Buy Until Fixed!!!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZQLNUJYYEWLA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07HB3ZX9F)""

Take a look at how Dell customer service is handling the issue in these support threads. If you use a USB-C mac with either monitor, speaking up politely and showing them how many Apple users care may help get this resolved.

favwfc,poqwrslr,iCloud two-factor verification same device,"I'm getting a weird situation on my macbook and iPhone.  Basically, every few weeks either device will ask me to re-input my password for iCloud and then require two-factor verification.  Mildly annoying, but no biggee for extra security.  The weird part is that the 6 digit code will pop up on both devices, no matter which one I'm trying to log in with.  For example, just now I was accessing my iCloud from my macbook and it required two-factor verification.  The 6-digit code literally popped up on my computer screen to be inputted into the iCloud website on my computer...the same happens with my phone (and yes, my phone had the same 6-digit code as the computer just now).

Is this normal, or is there a way to prevent what seems like an error?  Just seems to basically defeat the purpose of two-factor identification if the code is given to the device being used.  Obviously they would still need my password, but would like two-factor verification to work correctly if possible.",0,1582901866,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/favwfc/icloud_twofactor_verification_same_device/,apple,1

facdtj,A-nom-nom-nom-aly,Convert ipod classic connector to USB,"Hi folks, hoping some one can help me with this question.

&amp;#x200B;

My car has a 30pin ipod classic connector in it that I've been using with my old ipod for music. Sadly my old ipod has finally died after many years of use... and the cost of repairing it and converting it to SSD simply isn't worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I was wondering if there was any kind of adapter that I could plug onto the male 30 pin that would either allow me to plug in a USB based ipod or convert to bluetooth.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't build something myself as I lack the skills to do delicate soldering and wiring, so it does need to be plug and play.  My car doesn't have a simple audio input jack (daft I know) and the bluetooth built into the car is only for phone and not for music streaming.

&amp;#x200B;

I have looked into things like the grom audio and x-carlink kits... but the cost of doing that is as much as or more than doing the whole ipod classic conversions to ssd and a new battery.

&amp;#x200B;

The built in connector allows the use of the steering controls to work on the ipod and I'd like to retain that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Does such a thing exist?  I can get a newer version ipod of my sister who no longer uses hers but it's got the newer connector and not the old 30 pin one.",0,1582811582,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/facdtj/convert_ipod_classic_connector_to_usb/,apple,1

f9ryjf,MyMemesAreTerrible,Tip: Remove micro scratches from silver Stainless Steel iPhones and Apple watches with steel cleaner.,"I’ve had my current Pro Max for almost 2 months now, and I have noticed that already, it is significantly more dull than my dad’s space black X or my mum’s Gold XS all due to micro scratches, and while I usually keep my phone in a case, I like to take it out from time to time. I did a little reading on Apples website and found that unlike the coloured steels, the silver does not have a coating on it that resists scratches.

Note: this will not work well on deep scratches, only very light abrasions will be removed.


What you will need:

Stainless steel cleaner/polish (usually used for kitchens). Any kind that polishes will do.
Disposable paper towels for applying the polish and wiping it off after to check on progress.
A drill (you will be there for a long time if you do it by hand)
A polishing ball (you can find these in the detailing section of any car store for a few bucks)

What to do:
First, prepare your device and have all your materials ready. Clean off where your working, and ensure that your device, polishing ball, and towels are clean and free from any dirt.

Spray a small amount of polish into the paper towel, and apply the polish onto one side of the device that you will be working on. Its okay to get some on the glass, it shouldn’t scratch it.

Slowly at first, use the drill with polishing cone and go along the side of the device. I recommend doing this over a soft area incase you drop it or it gets flung out of your hands by the drill.

Gradually speed up the drill until you are at a comfortable speed. Slowly move your way across the area of the frame, and remove it every so often to check for heat. You don’t want the frame to get too hot.

Continue polishing until a black streak begins to form on the ball. When it does, wipe down the polished area until shiny, and check on the scratches. Continue polishing until you are satisfied with the glossiness.

Repeat on all four sides until satisfied.

You should now have an extra shiny device that looks good as new! For iPhone 11 users, you can also use this trick on the rear three camera lenses to give them new life.

Do not do this for aluminium devices. you’ll just destroy how it looks.

f9p63b,eazy760,Apple order stolen,"Last night I placed an order through Apple and needed my device pretty quickly so I chose next day delivery which is with postmates. My son was sick so we had to rush him to the doctors and I texted the delivery driver that I wouldn’t be home as soon as I saw he was on his way. He says ok cool man I’ll deliver when you’re available which was like an hour later. I get a notification on my phone saying the delivery was completed and signed for. I wasn’t too worried about it since it’s common for a lot of delivery services to mark packages delivered before they actually do. So I text him back asking him why was it marked delivered if I wasn’t home? I get a message back saying “ message not delivered “ so I start freaking out. I contact Apple through chat and they open an “investigation”. About 30 minutes later I get an email saying the investigation is complete and Apple will take no further action. So I call them and they tell me tough luck you’re item was stolen by someone and contact your local police department to submit a police report and once you can get the product back and return it to Apple I can get my money back. Has anything like this happened to anyone else ? My credit card was charge just shy of $3,000 and I’m supposed to wait until the police can retrieve it ? This is horrible idk what to do.

f9boxk,SACHD,Anyone else on the fence about the iPhone SE2?,"So I've owned an iPhone 7/8 for the last three years. Back when I got an iPhone 7 in 2017 I moved from a 5.2 inches screen(Nexus 5X) to a 4.7 inch one. Over the years I've done everything on the phone: texting, Reddit, even watched entire seasons and movies a couple times. Nothing about the screen ever bothered me. The screen size is very good honestly speaking it's enough for one handed use and also enough to watch the occasional video and whatnot.   


If I really had to find faults in my phone(iPhone 8 currently) it would have to be in the camera performance, RAM management and battery life. One of these three issues could easily be resolved by getting the battery replaced. But 3/3 issues could be fixed by upgrading to the iPhone SE 2 within a month or two.   


It should be a no-brainer purchase honestly. But why am I so hesitant? Something about the new bezel less iPhones just really  makes using a phone with a 7 year old form factor a bit less appealing than it should be, even if the device itself has basically no flaws and is perfect for me.   


Can other people chime in? What are current iPhone 6/6S/7/8 owners thinking about the SE2? Is there anyone who will even want to downgrade from an iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max to this device? My mind is constantly bobbing between ""this form factor is still awesome"" and ""I'm missing out.""",0,1582643690,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/f9boxk/anyone_else_on_the_fence_about_the_iphone_se2/,apple,1

Looking at buying a used iPhone, and see a lot of people advertise that the phone still has Apple warranty (note: not Apple Care).

&gt; [...] against defects in materials and workmanship when used normally in accordance with Apple's published guidelines for a period of ONE (1) YEAR from the date of original retail purchase **by the end-user purchaser**

I've loved it for years, but I want more screen real estate.  

Things I love:

- I love how clear the screen is ... I think it's due to the glass screen which has none of that fuzzy coating I see on Dell monitors at my work.

- I love that it has USB ports built-in so I can plug my keyboard and mouse into it, and then there's only one USB plug from the monitor to the MacBook

- I love that it has an MacBook power supply cable built into it so I can keep my MacBook powered without having to get out the MacBook's own power adapter.

- I love that it has built-in speakers so I don't have the extra fuss of speakers cables and power cables on my desk -- and the built in speakers actually sound really good for everyday use

- I also love that the back of the monitor looks nice in Apple aluminum, since when you look into my office, you see the back of the monitor

WHAT I WANT:

- I'm looking for a bigger screen with more resolution ... I guess that means a 27"" or 32"" 4k monitor?

- Ideally I'd like to spend about $500 or less, but if I have to spend more to get the right thing I will consider it.

Does anyone have any monitor suggestions that will suit my needs?  Thanks!",0,1582471723,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/f8auyg/advice_needed_please_suggest_a_new_monitor_to/,apple,1

I know it’s not uncommon to receive emails from dubious sources trying to mimic as Apple, be it “Apple ID locked” or “iTunes e-invoice” and whatnot.

I tend to be very careful when I receive these emails but I almost fell for it today. I made an Apple Store purchase online today and hours later I received an email from Apple claiming to be my invoice.

Since I made a purchase earlier, I did not give too much thought that it might possibly be a scam.

However before I clicked on the attachment, I realised that the English was terrible, in the typical scam email language.

Although there are many telltale signs when an email is fake, it is still good to be careful, especially in situations like this where you might be expecting an email in the first place.

Always check the content of the email (body text) if the subject doesn’t give it away immediately, but never make opening any attachments your first move. The email address might suggest to you if it is really from Apple too.

Stay digitally safe guys! PS: I should be fine if I did not open the attachment right?",27,1582449660,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/f879xs/be_extra_careful_when_opening_emails_from_apple/,apple,1

I just had a long chat with Apple Support, as my iPhone can't get repaired here in mainland China due to different device internals for Chinese/non-Chinese phones. I need to leave and go to Macao, which would be a day trip, just to find out how long it would take to get my phone repaired. Due to the current situation (virus, visa, University updates) it is essential for me to have my phone almost all the time, as Chinese authorities sometimes need information on a same-day basis (with WeChat), so I can't let this take too long. And I see no other way than a phone number to contact the store, which will be expensive for me to call as it is considered an outside of the country area...

If it would take too long I would need to continue using my phone with a damaged screen and non-functional camera, which might still be quite a while until things get better here.

I thought having AppleCare+ could help me in such cases... But well, I am on my own, Apple Support is so unhelpful. The only thing they can do is set up an appointment, and they can't contact the store either... What a farce.

f8347t,NaughtyDoggy02,Am I getting a good deal? Would it be a good experience?,"Somebody local is offering me a 2017 27 inch 5k iMac for 1250. 

&amp;#x200B;

24 gig ram. I know the amount of ram is upgradeable, so IMO that isn't a huge factor. 

1tb fusion. Planning to install 1tb PCIe ssd. 

3.5 ghz Quad Core i5

AMD Radeon 575 GPU

&amp;#x200B;

Here is why I am skeptical to purchase. I have a 2017 250ssd dual core i5 8 Gig ram 13 inch MacBook Pro. No dGPU, just the intel HD 640. I cannot have more than 3 apps open on Catalina without this thing sounding like an aircraft carrier. What usually triggers the temps to go up is anything related to graphics. So, if I am just scrolling through reddit, and then YouTube is playing in the other tab, this things fan cranks. And obviously, the whole computer slows down. I know, I know... Catalina uses 4GB of ram and Catalina needs a little GPU power. So, I don't know what Catalina would be like with a quad core, dGPU, and 24 gigs of ram. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan to not use Chrome. Just Safari. 16 ish tabs open, maybe with a few Word documents, Xcode, and discord. Want it to last 4 years.

f82ukh,Recovered_noodle,When Apple mess up things that used to work…,"It's happening more and more. One example - “Reminders”, was upgraded in IOS 13. But in a practical way it's now a lot worse than it was - 

* In Reminder check-lists, it used to be possible to quickly remove “completed” items from the list by quickly double-tapping the title word. They removed this highly useful shortcut, without replacing it. 
* On the lock screen new reminders just say “New Reminder” not what it the reminder says. This is a really hopeless change. 
* Going backward and forward, in and out of reminder lists now requires pressing a tiny left arrow at the top left of the screen. What is this, Windows 7? 
* Opening pages and the app in general is slower (meaning the code is less efficient) 
* There is a problem with Reminders not updating across devices on the same iCloud account. This never happened with the old Reminders.
* The app is less visually attractive than it was. 
* It’s not compatible Mac Mojave (only one Mac OS prior) this is unforgivable because many people avoided upgrading to Mojave for many reasons  

There are also various useful things they could have very easily introduced, but didn’t - It’s still impossible to set individual alert sounds to each reminder, for example. An obviously needed thing. 

This makes the customers like myself looking for alternatives.

f819sq,zed910,PSA: Apple Retail Customer Surveys,"I was a Genius for 3yrs, no longer am one, but would like to put out this Public Service Announcement for the benefit of all my friends still there.

When you fill out a customer service survey sent out to Apple Retail customers, on the backend the questions trickle down to NPS (Net Promoter Score) and TMS (Team Member Score). When you're asked to rate 1/5 ""How did Zed do?"" that gets filed under TMS. When you're asked to rate 1/5 ""What was your overall experience with Apple today?"" that gets filed under NPS.

1-3 are considered detractors. 4 is passive. 5 is a promoter. Anything other than 5 brings down the employee's NPS and TMS. Every comment you leave is able to be read by the managers and the employee that either checked you out (Sales), took your appointment (Support), or lead your Today at Apple session (Forum).

Internally, employees receive a raise once a year. Multiple factors play into the percentage an employee makes. An employee's NPS is one of those factors, TMS is not. Also not the only factor, but NPS is discussed when employees go for promotions as well, TMS is almost never discussed.

So lets pretend you checked in for your Genius Bar appointment, everything was running on time *(this is theoretical, btw),* the Genius who took your appointment was courteous and efficient  when checking in your cracked screen repair, but there were complications with the repair, poor communication in the Repair Room, and then the Genius Admin was unprofessional and did not apologise appropriately when your device was 2hrs late. In this scenario, you legitimately had a bad experience. For the most part, Apple Retail works very well. There is just such high volume that the scenario I describe is bound to happen to some customers (even if it's just one customer per store per day). If you answer that customer survey as the questions are asked and rate the Genius who took your appointment highly but rate the overall store poorly, the only person's NPS you're lowering is the Genius who took your appointment.

Here's my ask, when filling out the survey, if you had a good experience with the person who took your appointment but a bad experience overall, please still rate 5/5 for both the Store and the Person, but then go ahead and describe you're experience in the comments. If it was bad, by all means let the store know by filling out the survey. Just please don't potentially decrease the chance's for someone who did their job well getting a better raise or promotion because the person at check-in was rude or someone else failed to do their job accurately.",49,1582416019,https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/f819sq/psa_apple_retail_customer_surveys/,apple,1
