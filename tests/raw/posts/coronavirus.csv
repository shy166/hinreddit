fshgv8,MTOsterholm,"I’m Dr. Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious disease epidemiology and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota. AMA.","I’m a medical detective that has spent my career [investigating numerous infectious disease outbreaks](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/about-us/cidrap-staff/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).
 
In 2001, I helped form [CIDRAP at the University of Minnesota](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/), which is actively involved in a number of infectious disease issues including COVID-19, antimicrobial resistance, influenza, and chronic wasting disease. CIDRAP also has a full-time news team that provides visitors with current, comprehensive, and authoritative information on a daily basis free of charge.
 
In 2017, Mark Olshaker and I wrote the book [Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs](https://www.amazon.com/Deadliest-Enemy-Against-Killer-Germs/dp/0316343692), detailing the world’s most pressing infectious disease threats and laying out a nine-point strategy on how to address them. Two years ago, I wrote an [op-ed in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/opinion/flu-pandemic-universal-vaccine.html) that pointed to vulnerabilities in our supply chains, which unfortunately is playing out now. We weren’t prepared then and we needed to do better.
 
Now we’re in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic and [we’re still not prepared](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/u78jC31rK1SRoEpVuQZUwl?domain=time.com/). The coming months are going to be challenging and there are things that we must do, such as [keeping our frontline healthcare workers safe](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/02/13/health-care-workers-are-front-line-warriors-against-coronavirus-we-must-protect-them/). However, we will get through this and hopefully learn from our mistakes before the next pandemic emerges.

&gt;Hi there!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm Professor [Justin Boutilier](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ie/Faculty/Boutilier_Justin/) from the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am involved in leading an effort called the [Badger Shield](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/)  where the UW Makerspace and UW Hospital created an open-source medical  face shield design that can be manufactured at scale using basic  materials.  
&gt;  
&gt;This [website](https://making.engr.wisc.edu/shield/)  has intake forms for manufacturers who want to produce the shield and  medical facilities that need them. Using this information, we have  designed a matching system that connects requests from medical  facilities with manufacturers using a combination of priority, order  size, production capacity, location, need, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;We've  already received orders from 100+ medical facilities totaling more than  6 million shields and our manufacturer network includes 50+  organizations producing more than 500K shields per day. Wired ran a  story [here](https://www.wired.com/story/tinkerers-created-face-shield-being-used-hospitals/).  
&gt;  
&gt;**As  manufacturer production ramps up, we're looking for help connecting  with medical facilities in need across the country (and the world -  we've matches orders in Canada and Australia!)**",138,1585628584,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fs6auf/the_badger_shield_project_is_looking_for_help/,Coronavirus,1

frsy1f,UW_IPD_official,"We are scientists who use computers to design COVID-19 vaccine candidates — AND we’re part of the team behind Foldit, the computer game that lets anyone craft new antivirals. Ask us anything!","Hi Reddit! 

We're a team of researchers mostly from the [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/) (IPD) at the University of Washington School of Medicine. We use computers to create brand new proteins. Many of our scientists are now working to tackle coronavirus — they’re trying to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and diagnostics.  
To learn more about the IPD, check out this [2019 TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_baker_5_challenges_we_could_solve_by_designing_new_proteins/discussion?language=en) by IPD Director David Baker.  
Today we have folks from our vaccine design team here to answer questions about our nanoparticle vaccine platform. We are using it to develop a number of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as quickly as possible. To learn about our vaccine platform, check out this recent article in [STAT news](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/09/coronavirus-scientists-play-legos-with-proteins-to-build-next-gen-vaccine/) or read through our [scientific publications](https://kinglab.ipd.uw.edu/publications). This work is largely supported by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. We believe this technology could one day yield a **universal coronavirus vaccine** that would protect against not just SARS-CoV-2 but almost any future coronavirus. (Before the COVID-19 outbreak, we were hard at work on a universal flu vaccine.)  
We are also part of the team behind [Foldit](https://fold.it/), the free **scientific computer game** that lets anyone do protein design. We’ve got [puzzles up right now](https://fold.it/portal/puzzles) that challenge players to craft antiviral proteins against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The most promising solutions from Foldit players will be manufactured and tested at the IPD. We’re currently in our 5th round of anti-coronavirus Foldit puzzles, and are preparing to test our first designs in the lab. Check out this [NPR story](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2011/09/19/140606555/gamers-solve-stubborn-viral-mystery-the-shape-of-a-key-enzyme) on Foldit player’s prior work on an [HIV-related enzyme](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705907/).  
You don’t have to be a scientist to play Foldit! Check out our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGvlNo3nMfw) to learn more.
