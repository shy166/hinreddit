fsmk2r,Charlie--Dont--Surf,Tiger King reminded me how much I love Michael Bay’s “Pain and Gain”,"While watching the ""Tiger King"" series it dawned on me that it would be the perfect basis for a dark comedy crime script...which, in turn, reminded me how much I love Pain &amp; Gain. What I love most about Pain &amp; Gain is, I think, the same ingredients that have made Tiger King so popular: petty, vain schemers with zero self awareness bumbling into serious felony behavior in pursuit of their selfish goals. Both stories have their fair share of dark humor...and both also involve unusual methods of body disposal. Pain and Gain itself was loosely based on a true story. 

I actually first watched Pain and Gain without knowing it was a Michael Bay film. I dislike nearly every movie he's done. But Pain &amp; Gain, (and to a lesser extent “13 Hours”) made me realize that Michael Bay *can* make decent movies...when he wants to.

fsmet1,iCE_P0W3R,The Irishman is a bad movie,"I know this take is super late but whatever I'm in class and this was on my mind:

I understand that people like this movie a lot, but I don't see it. I have seen it on more than one occasion so I could try and understand why people like this movie. I have talked to people who have seen it. I've watched video essays on it. Despite all that, I don't understand why the movie reached such acclaim. 

Let me start by listing the things I like about this movie:

Al Pacino's performance as Jimmy Hoffa is damn good, most likely being the best performance in the movie. He's a fantastic actor, so this comes as no real surprise. I wouldn't say anything extreme like it was better than his role as Michael Corleone, but it was a strong depiction of Hoffa. His personality, while grounded in the blue collar work ethic and his hard-fought virtues, is damn-near larger than life. Every scene he's in, he commands your attention, with his brazen, confrontational attitudes, to his somewhat humorous manner. 

Joe Pesci, while absent in some long stretches of the movie, gives a good performance of Russell Bufalino. This was a noticeable departure from the more fiery roles we come to expect from Pesci (like Goodfellas and Casino) but he nonetheless is one of the best parts of the movie. There's an empathetic, caring nature of his character that contrasts nicely with the more conniving, apathetic business side of him. 

The story is legitimately interesting. I understand this mostly lies in the real-life mythos of the disappearance of Hoffa, but it's impossible not to gawk at the sheer size of the story. Constant power struggles between various mobsters? Union campaigns? Fighting for control of the Teamsters? There's nothing about the story that is not pure intrigue.

Now, for the things I dislike about the movie:

***FRANK SHEERAN***

Frank Sheeran is a character with a complete lack of depth and personality. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, but could they have made the protagonist any more unbearably boring? I don't even fault De Niro too much for this because he does the best with what he's given. Unfortunately, what he was given was a completely blank slate, and Scorsese said ""Be like this."" Sheeran is a ""witness character,"" meaning that he watches more powerful and interesting people around him do a bunch of important and powerful shit before he gets his one moment to do something that defines the story. He has few, if any, discernible character traits, except that he was violent one time to a shopkeeper and he is friends with Jimmy Hoffa. We're \*supposed\* to believe that this character is important and wields a level of influence and power, both in the mob, and in the Teamsters, yet, somehow, he is constantly powerless to affect any change in the story. On top of this, he has no character arc. He starts killing people, and he hurts a shopkeeper one time. At some point down the line, he kills his friend, and that makes him sad. 

It takes him 3 hours and 47 minutes of film time to realize that killing is wrong? Oh my god, what genius! 

I understand that what I just said was reductive, but I'm trying to illustrate the lack of thought given to an arc that was placed there rather intentionally. He's a hitman, a union leader, and the confidant of Jimmy Hoffa who struggles in his parental role as he resorts to violence too quick. There is a rich arc there that should be told, but this has to be balanced with him not doing anything so the main story can play out.

My main point about Frank is that the movie doesn't know whether or not to make him important or completely passive. Let's be clear: passivity has a place in storytelling. One of the best examples I can think of is Nick Carraway from The Great Gatsby, where him being a witness makes more sense and serves more of a purpose. I'm not saying it's impossible for a passive witness to be given an arc, but that's a challenge which requires a deft hand that the writers did not have when writing the script, as the film constantly flops between ""Oh he's important and a character you should focus on!"" and ""lol nvm not really.""

***CHARACTERIZATION***

Building off the last point, the characterization has serious issues that no one seems to address when talking about this movie. We are constantly given information about characters via cutaways, montages, or people just fucking telling us. Let's keep talking about Frank, since we were just talking about him. We are told Frank is a hitman for the mob when we see a montage of Frank throwing guns in a river while his older self narrates over it, and then we are shown that he has grown to be more violent in regular dealings when he beats up the shopkeeper. Aside from the fact this is very sudden and takes place over the course of 2 minutes, why did this change have to happen if we were just going to be told it anyway? Why not introduce him as a hitman struggling with his growing violent tendencies? Also, and much more egregious, why the hell is this the only real incident of his violent behavior affecting him outside of work? That's clearly what the scene is trying to portray, but it only happens once. If his character is changing, then it isn't just a one-time thing. Patterns form, with the violence potentially growing, as his character steeps deeper and deeper away from acting how he used to. Eventually, with his murder of Hoffa, he comes to realize how much he's changed as a person. Not only does that sound more intriguing, it's also more realistic.

This affects more than just Frank though. What about Russ, who was one of the better parts of the movie? Well, we see him dine with Frank a few times in the beginning, and we are literally told that Russ saved his life and that he is a great friend to Frank. Obviously, this is meant to communicate that he considers Frank a friend. Unfortunately, this suffers from the same mistake as last time. Russ is straight up absent for a huge part of the middle of the movie, where he all but disappears. How are we supposed to believe that he's a great friend if we've just seen them eat and bowl twice and we're just told it once? That doesn't make the audience believe anything.

The story is severely limited by the way in which characters are built, as it weakens the impact that arcs can have, and it puts a severe damper on potential character moments. Instead of letting us see how a character is, we have to constantly be artificially told how things are, or how this character is, when a better alternative would be to show us naturally.

***THE TONE***

This movie is pretentious as hell for a story that has such a weak protagonist and characterization. Everything about this movie screams ""TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!"" as if it was a fucking Christopher Nolan movie. The muted colors, the ham-fisted symbol of the daughter, the loaded cast of people who do absolutely nothing, and the hilariously dumb stills of characters with their faces and their deaths. 

I understand that they aren't 1-to-1 but tell me that those still shots of the faces with their fates isn't as ridiculous as this video:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOpapeX6Vzs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOpapeX6Vzs) 

Also, how quick was the whole idea of ""painting houses"" dropped? As soon as he stopped painting houses in the movie. I mean, he does this whole pretentious, ""Before the mob I thought when you said you paint houses, it meant you paint houses"" speech. Then, when they get on the road, they do a laughably bad edit of the car and these 3 black frames coming in and out saying ""I HEARD YOU PAINT HOUSES."" 

This movie is horribly pretentious for the story it tells. Hell, it's pretentious for the story it's trying to tell too. At its best, while it is a story about the Teamsters and the mafia, the story of a violent father, and the story of the greatest Union leader the US has ever seen, it's also not a super complex analysis of the way of the world or human nature. I mean damn, the Godfather is much more thorough in its dissection of capitalism, family, and masculinity, and if it had some of the shit that was in this movie, it would be too much. 

***ANTI-AGING***

This isn't as serious a criticism of the movie but I think it's important to mention: the technology is fucking stupid. 

First off, while I acknowledge how impressive the technology is, it's extremely limited in what it can do. Sure, these characters look SLIGHTLY younger. They also still move like old people because old people are the actors getting re-aged. Yes, if they sat down in front of me and stood still, I would be convinced, but no, I watched a geriatric De Niro beat up a shopkeeper with slightly smoother skin. It wasn't convincing.

Second, how much age does it really take off? De Niro does not look that young in the beginning of the movie, like he's pushing 55-60. That's an achievement, but it's not super effective to the audience. Plus, any age after that still makes him look really damn old. I have to be honest, I thought De Niro looked the same across however many years it was supposed to be. It didn't impact my viewing experience tremendously, but it was weird.

This brings me to my main point: why the fuck wouldn't you hire younger actors? Sure, I understand that these people are all legends and they can act and all that, but this younger generation has some great actors too. Is it in way possible for the mantle to be passed? Mob movies are among some of the greatest movies ever made. Do we just let the flame die out because there will be no more actors from the original movies? What a ridiculous notion. I want to see new movies, new art being made. This movie feels like it's supposed to be a farewell, but art is supposed to evolve. You don't just close it up\[ and say ""We're done, no more."" You keep the style going until it's outta gas. Using old actors will probably kill off this genre quicker than the styles being outdated.

I feel like it has one major detraction that I can't get past: Juliette Lewis. It's partially the way her character is written, but the quality of the other actors highlights how truly awful her performance is throughout. 

There's dumb teenager, and then there is her specific brand of unintended half retarded that throws everything off, and detracts from all else going on. While I wonder if this was a specific choice, or if everyone on set was wondering what the hell she was doing as filming took place?

She ended-up being nominated for best supporting actress however, despite all that. Do you think she was deserving of that praise?",14,1585690970,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsm0m0/those_of_you_who_are_fans_of_cape_fear_1991_do/,movies,0

Positives: Daniel Day Lewis is extraordinary in his role, he was amazing( The other cast was good as well). Paul Thomas Anderson is directing this movie greatly, well done. The movie has its tone throughout the entire run time, thanks to the directing, the pretty good score, and the well looking cinematography. The charcters are interesting and the movie is just written really good.
Negatives: hard to think, but some scenes could have been cut out, and I would have added another scenes in the final act. 
Conclusion: this is great, it really is. There will be blood is just a great movie.

This was the first of many movies that Peter Segal has filmed with former SNL castmates. The film was shot primarily in Toronto and Los Angeles under the working title ""Rocky Road"". It tells the story of a socially and emotionally immature man (Farley) who learns lessons about friendship and self-worth following the sudden death of his industrialist father. The film did well commercially, but received mixed reviews from critics. However, since its release, Tommy Boy has become a cult classic due to being very successful on home video.",119,1585690717,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fslxuc/tommy_boy_turns_25_today/,movies,10

fsltvb,DoctorSnaut,MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN (2019): failure?,"So, **Motherless Brooklyn (2019)...**

I went into this movie with relatively low expectations because of the feedback it has got (grossed $24 million on its $26 million budget), but as Edward Norton didn't fail me in the past I just felt the need of giving him the chance and let me tell you, I honestly don't get why it isn't praised? Not saying it's one of the best, but it's certainly not bad. I'm going to try to write out some points why I liked this movie and I'd appreciate it ***IF!*** someone could explain me what is bad about it, because I am no professional, just an ordinary movie enthusiast:

* First of all: camera work (some very beautiful shots, made me pause the movie just to appreciate the aesthetics of the scenes) alongside with atmospheric color grading was just stunning. It really gave the feeling of being there, in New York of 1950s having that darker theme. You could really see Nortons perfectionism kicking in hard and I thought Lionel was kind of reflection of the Norton himself in the real life (as Lionel described that he has that condition to make everything perfectly).
* Excellent music, matched the atmosphere.
* This movie got everything: crime, drama, action, mystery, an political message - you name it. It did a really good job on making me care about characters, but maybe it's because I can relate to Lionel and his past very much. Also, what a fucking incredible performance by Gugu Mbatha-Raw! I have to admit, I am hard to impress by woman actresses (nothing personal I promise, lol), but she smashed it. Alec Baldwin did a good job portraying the bad guy and Willem Dafoe with Michael Kenneth Williams are also worth to point out.
* In the middle of the movie I felt like I got the answer to why people didn't like it, because I thought the movie lost the meaning of it all and made me question where does it all go, but when Lionel himself told that he don't even know what is he doing anymore, it suddenly made sense - it was meant to lose the point.
* Good humor! Even though I don't think it's funny having that condition which Lionel had, it certainly made the tension loosen up when it was needed and made me chuckle many times.

Having said that, I did spot one mistake though: it was when Lionel was having a chat with Moses - Lionel had arms crossed when he spoke, but when camera changed on Moses, he was standing straight. But that's not a big deal.

So yeah, like I said I would appreciate ***IF!*** you'd share your thoughts on that movie.",15,1585690343,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsltvb/motherless_brooklyn_2019_failure/,movies,0

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

fskho6,newjapanfan3000,What should Robert Downey Jr. Do post Marvel?,"I don't have an opinion about Dr. Dolittle but let's look at the facts: Dr. Dolittle was a failure. It bombed at the box office and was received poorly by critics, which is pretty shocking considering it starred the most recognizable actor in the highest grossing franchise in film history as the lead. Now that it's pretty clear going the children's movie route didn't work, what should he do?






I think going back and showing up in prequels and origin stories for Marvel is a safe choice that I don't think anyone would mind seeing him in. But I'd rather see him go into other fields. What about crime dramas? I think he's got the sort of depth to be in a Scorsese like crime drama as a lead. Anyways, what do you think?





EDIT: okay my bad. I just googled it and apparently he signed another deal with Marvel for an MCU return. That still doesn't neccesarily mean he can't try other things",40,1585686141,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fskho6/what_should_robert_downey_jr_do_post_marvel/,movies,0

fsk1yq,J0hnn2049,As great as Leo was in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood... what actual faded away movie star would have been perfect as Rick Dalton?,"Tarantino is known for revitalizing an actor’s dead carreer and bringing them back in the spotlight, so I was surprised he didn’t go that way for Rick Dalton after seeing this movie.

Leo is truly great in this film, but he is also arguably one of the biggest movie stars out there at the moment that it almost feels like wasted potential given the nature of the role. Seeing him act and reminisce like the world forgot him is kinda funny yeah, but would imo have been so much more heartfelt and genuine in a meta kind of way if it was played by an actual washed up movie star who was once at the top of his game, but has now faded away. Kinda like the Keaton effect in Birdman.

I had a talk with my friend that Johnny Depp would have been great in this role. I know he’s still an A-lister, but it’s nothing compared to how huge and loved Depp used to be. He was such an interesting actor with good projects back then, became a superstar around 2003-2010 with Pirates and scored 3 Oscar nominations in 4 years. I really feel he hasn’t done anything relevant since besides milking Jack Sparrow some more. Maybe I’m still hoping for him to have a “return to form” role someday. But that’s just my choice, what about you? Who do you think should have played Rick Dalton?",187,1585684800,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsk1yq/as_great_as_leo_was_in_once_upon_a_time_in/,movies,6

fsjkgn,RadProX,"The Missing (2003) - the spiritual predecessor to ""Bone Tomahawk""","While ""Bone Tomahawk"" seems to be one of the most common films that is periodically ""discovered"" on /r/movies every now and then, I was surprised to find out, after viewing Ron Howard's  ""The Missing"" on how similar in style and tone the two movies are. The plots are rather identical in that a close family member of each film's main character is kidnapped by a rogue Apache/troglodyte group and that main character joins up with others to rescue them back while journeying through the harsh wilderness of the American West. Both are violent and rather minimalistic in their approaches to the story, though ""The Missing"" does not have a comparable scene in terms of ""Bone Tomahawk's"" brutal final minutes, though it does come close.

Considering that ""The Missing"" was directed by Ron Howard, I was surprised to see that the film eschews his usual notions of sentimentality to craft an experience that is rawer than his previous works. The cinematography by Salvatore Totino is reminiscent of Andrew Dominik's later works and the violence is shot with an unflinching eye that would not be mismatched among some of Mel Gibson's films. Cate Blanchett is the standout as the lead in ""The Missing"" but special praise has to be given to Jenna Boyd as Blanchett's young daughter in the movie, for her character is a constant witness to the barbarous and unrelenting realism of the violence and her depicted reactions give the movie extra weight with the stakes, as though as the audience dreads such brutality potentially befalling a child her age.

Considering the near constant praise being devoted to ""Bone Tomahawk"" I was surprised to learn that ""The Missing"" only received a 58% on Rotten Tomatoes when it was first released. Perhaps it was a movie that was ahead of its time? Did audiences still cling to the romanticized notions of a Western that ""Unforgiven"" had earlier tried to abolish?

What are your thoughts on ""The Missing"" and are there any other Westerns out there that might have received the same reception that possibly did not deserve it?",6,1585683233,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsjkgn/the_missing_2003_the_spiritual_predecessor_to/,movies,2

But I also look to compare this decade to other decades to see if this was actually good.   That got me thinking, what is the best decade for Films.  I look at the Dark night or Pulp Fiction but instead look at the entire decade, one year cant really make or brake a decade.  But personally I landed on the 70's as the best decade for film.  I think this not because of what came out, but Hollywoods intention at the time.  It was when a filmmaker pitch an idea to a studio, and make the film and be doe with it.  Major studios were still focusing on the creativity of the idea.  But after Star-Wars was released, it showed that it could make money off screen selling toys.  Now a studios main intention is to make as much money as possible,by selling toys, partnerships and making a ton of squeals.  And the 70's gave us a time when the art  of film making was more defined there was more production value and more technology that allowed for greater films. Id also like to point out, Eraserhead, Taxi Driver, Godfather, Rocky, Jaws etc. What do you think is the best decade for film?",14,1585681981,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsj633/what_is_the_best_decade_for_film/,movies,0

fsixux,Gattsu2000,"Which Is Your Favorite Low Budget, Independent Film?","For me, no doubt that it is Christopher Nolan' s ""Memento"" (2000), a story that on its surface, is about a man with short term memory who wants revenge on the death. Memento is my 2nd favorite movie of all time and by far, my favorite Nolan film. Not just because of how amazingly written, edited and structured it is. Not because it has a beautiful score that really reaches my heart strings and has plenty of cool details. I also love Memento because of how thematically resonates with me.

Despite saying that I do respect the opinion of others, I get scared when I get my opinion challenged or that somebody dares to change that perspective I just had for something. When I want hold on to something so dearly, that becomes my only dedication. And when somebody calls it out, I feel attacked and I lose what I consider my meaning in my life. When it becomes too overwhelming, I try to avoid whatever tried to take that away from me and just create more distractions for myself to hold on to this precious thing rather than letting it go. 

Memento is a story about the subjectivity of a person and about someone who has to live his life by avoiding whatever is trying to take away the goal/purpose of the character. Leonard wants revenge but he doesn't only want revenge. He wants to get away from something he finds unpleasant to face. He wants a purpose. In my case, my purpose are the beliefs I have for things currently and to protect them from the outsiders.

Memento is a story that overtime, became even more relevant to my own life and that you do not need to have short term memory in order for Leonard to be so close to us as people.

Memento also has the best structure I've seen in any film because it is perfectly purposefully for the story it is expressing. Just like Leonard, we have no idea about what happened before and we have to go backwards in order to ""get back"" those memories again. And you think this would take out the surprise of the experience but actually, in our perspective, it actually feels like we're watching the beginning and then we're about to reach the end. The ending is when the amazing reveal occurs. Not to mention that there are some pretty subtle and cool details that add to the theme of a unreliable memory/perspective, which not reinforce its themes but puts us in the shoes of the main characters. For example, you could swear that you saw something exactly how you remembered it and the first thing going through it, you do not question anything but after checking it out carefully, you'll notice that something looks different and that also helps making the experience more rewatchable and ambiguous.

A honorable mention would be Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" (1994). I absolutely adore the hilarious and very well-written dialogue and its fun characters.",55,1585681285,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsixux/which_is_your_favorite_low_budget_independent_film/,movies,5

fsimui,whatever_matters,The Pursuit of Happyness is the American equivalent of Parasite,"TLDR: The Pursuit of Happyness is not a fairy tale celebrating American dream. It is a sarcastic comment on capitalism. Don't downvote even if you don't agree with me.

The two films have so many similarity, such as:

1. Symbol of greed

Will Smith's character (Chris) is a bone scanner salesman and always carries one with him. He bought a lot of scanners to sell and thought it would bring happiness to his family. But it does the opposite. Greed, the pursuit of fortune, tears his family apart. In Parasite, the poor family's son, Ki-woo, was given a rock by his old friend. He was also invited to tutor a rich kid. He thought it was a blessing. Again, greed leads him to devastation. It is worth mentioning that both characters made a wrong investment - Bone scanners and cake shop. That's how capitalism (particularly stock market) works. The rich can easily prey on the misinformed poor people.

2. Education as obstacle to social mobility

Chris only finished high school and he said in the voice-over that he doesn't the extra 3 lines on the education part of his CV. Yet he performed well in the intern exam. Ki-woo failed the university admission exam four times but he later found out he is a marvelous con-man (as if it is a career). Education doesn't reflect a man's ability yet everyone is required to graduate in university. Tuition fees are the admission fee to get into the labour market.

3. Symbol of the wealth gap

The backdrop of The Pursuit of Happyness is set in San Francisco, a city famous for its steep streets. The rich businessmen live at the top of the hill. Will Smith couldn't even afford the taxi fee to get there. This scenario is replicated in Parasite where the rich and the poor are living in separate world.

4. The poor live in a dog-eat-dog world

""They are nice because they are rich."" It's a famous quote from Parasite. Poor people have to be ruthless to vie for the scarce resources. They schemed to kick the housekeeper and the driver out of the house so as to take their places. In The Pursuit of Happyness, Will Smith lost his only friend when he asked his friend to pay back 20 bucks. The poor are not born to be bad people. They are shaped by the toxic environment.

What do you think of The Pursuit of Happyness? Parasite may be bolder and funnier, but content wise, these two films are comparable.",12,1585680352,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsimui/the_pursuit_of_happyness_is_the_american/,movies,0

fsihp8,SpaceNun99,Why was the Academy too afraid to give Sandler a nomination?,"I just got done watching Uncut Gems, and, while it did not blow my mind, if this guy was anyone but Adam Sandler he would have had a much better chance at a nomination.

Can you imagine the hype train and infinite money thrown down if this was Leo's big Oscar run? IMO this film does more than Scorsese did with Leo. I was always not quite believing that role with Leo. Different films for sure, but I really appreciate the more down to earth Uncut Gems. It's not afraid to leave things unsolved, but it also hints at the issues and makes sure we know there is no winner.

Hell, Sandler was born to play this role. It's like an amalgamation of all his silly Jewish characters but with a real dose of reality attached to it. I think he is rightfully getting accolades. Even if he didn't win, it's ludicrous that he will be overlooked. It just makes the Academy to me look lifeless and stuck within their own zone. Same thing when Keaton did not win. It wasn't like I needed him to win, but to see the award go to the guy in make-up acting like a bunch of videos he rehearsed was not to me the real performance that year. It was the routine performance.

But I digress. Did you feel Sandler deserved to get in? I'm not exactly a HUGE Sandler fan, but I do enjoy more than a couple of his movies, and his humor has always had some good fun to it.",31,1585679906,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsihp8/why_was_the_academy_too_afraid_to_give_sandler_a/,movies,0

fsgtv0,Giagotos,South American movie about a father and two sons,"Trying to remember a movie I saw on IFC years ago about two sons who move with their father after their parents split. I think it took place somewhere in a south American city.

Sort of a family drama, the movie had English subtitles

The movie is through the eyes of the kids and their imaginations when they move into an apartment.

The father is not a very good caregiver but gets on with them better as the movie goes on

The last shot of the movie is them riding up in a cable car. I've looked up different south American cable cars that go along big bridges, but the only one I could find that looked similar to the movie was the Coney island cable car, so maybe was a spanish/Portuguese language movie based in New York?

Help appreciated as this has been bugging me for some time, Thanks!",2,1585674679,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsgtv0/south_american_movie_about_a_father_and_two_sons/,movies,0

Not that she's not famous. 

It's just that, for some reason, I thought she was a legit movie star in the 90's alongside the likes of Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts. I think it is because she managed to be in four hit movies from 1996-2000 (Twister, As Good As It Gets, What Women Want, and Cast Away).

But looking up her IMDB profile a few years ago, I was surprised to find she spent most of the 90's just working on Mad About You. Given the successful movies she was in, it felt like she was in way more movies back in the 90's and early 2000's than she actually was.",30,1585674662,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsgtn1/actors_you_thought_were_bigger_stars_than_they/,movies,0

fsgrx8,ItsSaulGo0dman,“Climax” by Gaspar Noé,"Just saw this last night... I’m not entirely sure how I can explain this film other than that it’s a fucking endurance test. The movie is basically a combination of dance, sex, violence, drugs, gore, and more all wrapped up into one extremely hallucinatory trip that just fucks you up from start to finish. It’s a foreign film, but even then there are no subtitles for you to follow, the director wants you to immerse yourself in this and figure it out from there. It has some of the finest choreography I’ve seen displayed in any film and is just a true thrill to watch. Be warned though, you’ll probably need to take a long nap once you make it through this movie. Truly is something I have never experienced before, and probably won’t experience again for a little while.",6,1585674513,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsgrx8/climax_by_gaspar_noé/,movies,0

fsfxgz,ZombieBoy98,What does reddit think of Spielbergs War of the Worlds (2005),"When I was 8 I went to see this on the big screen. It was one of the best cinematic experiences I had. I wasn’t sure what this movie was about but seeing the tripods and the horn terrified me. I remember so many great scenes from this film. I loved the beginning where the tripods coming up from the ground. The shot of them rising over the city is so menacing and you know immediately to fear them.

The ferry scene is great. Seeing them rise over the hills and everyone panicking is probably my favourite scene of the film. When the ferry is tipped over and the tripods start scooping people up from the water its really horrific. The special effects are great even if the film is a bit rushed. The scene after that were the tripods are zapping people on the hill and you hear people screaming gave me nightmares. 

My only complaint is the ending where the son is back in Boston completely unharmed after seeing him make the most idotic decision in a movie I’ve ever seen. What are you going to do Robbie? Throw rocks at the tripods? So dumb. I would of been completely fine if he didn’t show up at the end of the movie. 

What does reddit think of this film. I think it has aged well. Wish the ending was better but the first and second part of the film is great. A lot of rememberable scenes that stuck with me. 
Because of this film I have read the book and was interested in every tripod design. The 2005 tripod is my favourite, the great Martian war one is my second favourite design. This movie fascinated me so much as a kid.",95,1585671814,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsfxgz/what_does_reddit_think_of_spielbergs_war_of_the/,movies,9

The only real problem overall though was how long it was , I don't think the framing device of the pages being turned even needed to be there- it doesn't really add any focus and it's not an original idea.

Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.

Also, it's pretty fascinating to see what kind of movies have held up over time culturally and which ones have faded away. Some omissions from these lists are pretty shocking to me. 


[1940s](https://letterboxd.com/tinyapartment/list/top-50-of-the-1940s/)

[1960s](https://letterboxd.com/tinyapartment/list/top-50-movies-of-the-1960s/)


Kubrick has 4 movies (2001, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, Spartacus) and so does Leone (Dollars Trilogy and Once Upon a time in the West). Godard leads the French New Wave with 3. Agnes Varda has the first feature length film directed by a woman to appear with Cleo from 5 to 7. Clint Eastwood is the most represented actor, starring in the Dollar Trilogy.

Coppola has 4 in total (The Godfather 1 and 2, Apocalypse Now, The Conversation), with 3 in the top 8. Scorsese and Spielberg burst into the scene with 2 each. DeNiro stars in 4 movies, and so does Diane Keaton.

Spielberg (Juassic Park, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) and Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) lead the way with 3, while Fincher has 2 in the top 4. The Disney renaissance makes a good showing. The decade of Tom Hanks; he has 5 movies here. DeNiro has his 3rd consecutive decade of appearing in at least 3. Julianne Moore and Natalie Portman both show up in 3.

Harry Potter dominance; 5 of them are here. Christopher Nolan is nearly as dominant with 4. All Lord of the Rings in the top 20. Christian Bale and Elijah Wood have 4 movies here, the most of anyone besides the Potter people.

I obviously have seen a lot of DDL,Philip seymour hoffman,Marlon brando,Gary oldman,Joaquin Phoenix.

Among his contemporaries Al pacino ,who is loved by everyone and i believe has more iconic performances than de niro.

I consider Jack Nicholson the closest to de niro when it comes to acting but imo De niro is the best actor to have ever lived.

I recently watched cape fear and was blown away by the performance. Few weeks before i watched awakenings.The range de niro can deliver is mind boggling.

Here's my list of 10 Male best actors

1)Robert de niro
2)Jack Nicholson 
3)Al pacino
4)Christian Bale
5)Joaquin Phoenix 
6)Gary oldman
7)Philip Seymour Hoffman 
8)Daniel day Lewis

It was a very well told story that blended elements of a crime drama with the supernatural/unknown, which, while not a new idea, was done with quite a bit of nuance and depth in this film. While full of memorable scenes/sequences, one that really stuck out to me in particular was fairly early on (and thankfully mentioning it doesn't spoil anything in the film) where a hunter sees a naked man in the woods and gets rightfully spooked by him. Now obviously the setup is kind of creepy to begin with, but I noticed there was a really unnatural creepiness to seeing the images from that scene play out in broad daylight. There was something extra unnerving about having the light, our childhood safety blanket, in the foreground along with the horror playing out. Is there any films/scenes that you've seen that were made creepier or more unsettling due to playing out during the day?

fse42x,Zylbath,British movie about a boy who sees ghosts (NOT Sixth Sense),"Hello,

I am looking for a movie since quite some time but I cannot remember its name and I am running out of possible keywords for a google search.  
I don't remember overly much of it, but I am 90% certain it was a British movie. I have found this forum question (about what movie the person could have watched):   
 [https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/ive-seen-a-movie-about-a-young-man-who-can-see-ghosts-who-meets-a-girl-who-can-also-see](https://getsatisfaction.com/imdb/topics/ive-seen-a-movie-about-a-young-man-who-can-see-ghosts-who-meets-a-girl-who-can-also-see)   


And I am rather positive they could mean the same movie/film as I am. It is not some kind of antiquated or old movie, but it is also not new, it might even be from 2000, plus minus some years, but I rather think it is after that date.  
The general story is described in the link above, what I remember is that the setting is some British big city (probably London) and it is about a boy who seems to live with his father and they don't have much money and live in those big collective blocks with flats. The boy is often strolling around some concrete settings and city ruins in his jogging suit, is mostly alone and he can see ghosts that appear to him every now and then and he gets scared by it but can't tell his dad because they have no good relationship to another.   
The movie is not overly intended to be a scary horror film, it is rather a tragedy movie with some scary moments, the tragic life of some poor boy in a big English city (who also happens to see ghosts).  
I cannot remember the story with the girl as described in the above link, but it sounds familiar and it might be the plot of this film.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have any idea what it might be? It's not that it was overly good, but I kind of got stuck with the utter urge to finally know what film it was.  
Any help would be appreciated, even if it is new keywords by which I can use google. xD Thanks a lot!",4,1585665807,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fse42x/british_movie_about_a_boy_who_sees_ghosts_not/,movies,1

He finally decides he is worthy, and slow walks towards the train, the suspense building as it's not clear if he's just walking down the platform or towards the train. Then in a smooth gesture, he steps on, waits a beat, then goes inside to start his new life. The train disappears (into history, as does men like Capt. Joe) and pedestrians cross the tracks, blissfully unaware of the horrors of war that led to their mundane daily routine.",9,1585664705,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsdsvz/what_was_the_movie_hostiles_about/,movies,1

fsdgd2,MojoRadioGang,Midsommar and Hereditary,"Hey folks! 

So I watched Midsommar two days ago (since in my country it just got released on amazon prime) and I really liked it. However, I am not what you would call a typical horror fan, simply because I am easily scared and cannot stomach too much violence. For reference: other horror movies which I really liked were The Lighthouse, the Witch and Get Out. Since I finally managed to watch Midsommar, which besides it’s really shocking moments of violence was not too bad for me. Thus, I wanted to ask: if Midsommar was more or less fine for me, can I watch Hereditary? Is it more shocking, creepier or else? How do they compare to each other simply in the sense of „how hard is it to watch the movie for me“, baring in mind that Midsommar was fine, even though the violence was kinda heavy for me. Thank you for all your answers I’m advance, cheers! 

TLDR; I am easily scared and finally dared to watch Midsommar. I want to watch Hereditary now, but I am unsure whether I can or not, in the sense of how scary/violent/shocking the movie is in comparison to Midsommar.",13,1585663436,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsdgd2/midsommar_and_hereditary/,movies,1

Through each process, the director often sat in front of the camera and narrated

Basically at the end of the film, actress shoots and kills the director, take whole video. The last scene of the couple becoming stars, walking on the red carpet to receive the award

I recently say a nice tread about Starship Troopers on r/movies, this interview of 3 years ago is a very nice addition for those interested.

  
From Youtube:  
Director Paul Verhoeven and actor Casper Van Dien discuss their 1997 film 'Starship Troopers' before a screening at the Film Society of Lincoln Center.   Part comic book–style action adventure, part scathing satire of the military-industrial complex, Starship Troopers is one of the most subversive artistic acts ever perpetrated with a $100 million budget. Welcome to the 24th century, where fresh-faced, idealistic teens are encouraged to join up and become “citizens” by enlisting in the intergalactic army. They’ll grow up, see the universe, and, oh yeah, be slaughtered by the thousands as they battle giant, mutant insects threatening to wipe out mankind. Abetted by seamless special effects and impressively gory CGI carnage, Verhoeven delivers both a thrilling science fiction spectacle and a devastating takedown of jingoistic militarism.",33,1585662727,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsd9kz/starship_troopers_qa_paul_verhoeven_casper_van/,movies,1

fscxzm,MickieMallorieJR,"Platform theory I haven't seen discussed, at all. (Spoilers)","My wife and I watched The Platform over the weekend and were initially puzzled by the ending, as I assume many others were.  Having time to digest the film...here's what I came up with.

* Miharu immigrated to this country in search for a better life. Specifically, the allure of television and film which often presents Western nations glamourously... very rarely displaying the underbelly of our society's. Miharu represents the millions immigrants who flee their country's of origin often gripped with circumstances akin to levels 100 through 333.

* The child was born into this system and Miharu's desperate search represents the countless parents struggle to fight their way through numerous levels to protect their kids and give them that better life they came searching for. Level after level, killing, being killed, being physically and emotionally taken advantage of...takes its toll on all of us, but especially women and immigrants who aren't lucky enough to have a foundation for better.

- The child on the last level represents all of the children whose present and future is being crushed under the weight of this system. Capitalism at its core...is about the present, along with short term gains. It's not ideal for a future that relies on limited resources, which the food on the platform represents.

* Further, the child represents all of the kids in poverty that movements for change rest upon. Alan Kurdi from Syria who washed ashore in Turkey. The starving children of Yemen. The freezing kids in Syria. The American children who rely on the school system to satiate their hunger. The Central American children trapped in refugee camps at the border. The hope is that the existence of these kids...that all of us from floor 333 to 0 and above seem to forget...might force us to the conclusion that this system is broken. That if we can't save the kids at the bottom...maybe we can see that's it's our own childrens future that is bleak, dark and devoid of resources. 

Those were my biggest take aways. Even of the YouTube ending explanations I watched...I hadn't heard that yet. To be honest however...I don't see children or our childrens future changing the system. As mentioned Capitalism is very short sighted and selfish...it relies on humanities basis instincts. Many people around this world would use a child to fulfill their short lived fantasies of excess and personal joy...and they do. This realization is extremely depressing...along with the Platform.",0,1585661464,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fscxzm/platform_theory_i_havent_seen_discussed_at_all/,movies,1

fscv7f,CentristPolitician,Can someone explain why MASH (1970) is so highly viewed by critics?,"When MASH began, I thought that its trio of main characters were high school bullies. By the end of the first act I believed them to be sociopaths. At the midpoint I realized they were plain psychopaths and threw up my hands in frustration. I understand, in theory, why this film is supposed to be funny…but it’s not. It’s a black comedy that forgot to add in the comedy. I don’t root for any of the protagonists. I don’t care about how they interact with one another or what is driving them. The film is also deeply misogynistic. The only major female character is Hot Lips who gets the name Hot Lips after someone sneaks a microphone into her tent while she’s having sex, which is bad enough. But then the film becomes inhuman when the guys decide to yank the tent up while she is showering. They all cackle and heckle while she screams, naked and horrified, in front of them. That was supposed to be…funny? And then, inexplicably, after she has sex with Duke for no apparent reason, she turns into a completely mindless cheerleader during the climactic football game. It’s not even the same character, and there is no transitory scene where she begins to root for them. The fact that the movie simply has her shack up with one of the surgeons and then appear brainless for the rest of the movie sickens me. MASH seems to reward the assholes and misogynists while punishing the actually good characters. And I haven’t even mentioned the presence of toxic masculinity where Walter pretends to commit suicide just so he could have sex with Maria. The whole thing feels like a poorly made Adam Sandler movie. The whole anti-establishment message is extremely loud and clear but it's never delved into deeply enough to have a conversation about it. We never get to see any of the majors' opinions on why they follow the rules so tightly, instead we get 2 hours of Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland acting like spoiled brats. I'm open to a conversation though if you feel that this movie is quite good please explain your reasoning.",11,1585661141,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fscv7f/can_someone_explain_why_mash_1970_is_so_highly/,movies,1

fscnwv,Engineering_123,Vivarium (2020) is either the best or worst movie to watch during Quarantine.,"It stars Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg and they are fucking amazing in it. They play a couple who are looking for a house but is thrown in to this weird monolithic suburbia at house number 9.

The movie is directed by Lorcan Finnegan and is just plain weird and horrific most of the time. It's been described as to be this film about de-humanization and it shows.

I don't know which genre to put this in. It comes across as sci-fi, horror and a thriller. At times even Lovecraftian. The horror aspect is the one I felt the most. This film has made me feel scared than almost any other. A lot of the reason is probably due to the isolation felt by the characters is also prevalent right now.

This movie's theme of isolation and mental degradation is so traumatizingly portrayed that I needed hours of funny cat videos to make me feel better.

I highly recommend this film. Imogen poots is amazing in it and Jesse Eisenberg is also great. The direction is outstanding and editing is unreal.

Admittedly, even if she was offered a part (which would be unlikely given how the film was supposed to begin production next month and it's only been delayed due to coronavirus), I'm not sure she'd be able to take it, due to her busy voice acting career.",5,1585658788,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fscabm/what_if_tara_strong_was_cast_in_the_disneys/,movies,1

fsbzes,mhdz_90,Looking for obscure sci-fi trailer/film from late 1990's,"Hi everyone, need help looking for an old trailer or movie. Around 1999 or 2000 I travelled with family from the US to Mexico on one of those commuter bus. On the ride the bus had the Blair Witch Project running on their TVs but right before the film there was an ad or trailer of sorts for a film called ""The Dot"" or ""The Spot"". I was about 10 at the time but I remember some of these shots vividly. I wasn't sure if the trailer was Artisan produced or if it was a parody commercial but I am 100% sure that it involved this: a corporate meeting with suits. There's a large table in a conference room with everyone either sitting or near the table. At the end of the trailer a MASSIVE black or dark ball/sphere is dropped onto the table and everyone looks at it in awe or fear (not 100% sure about their reaction) and ""The Dot"" is revealed at the end of the trailer. As a kid I thought this was promotional material for an obscure Artisan film but I cannot for the life of me find anything about it online. Does this ring a bell for anyone?

The only other explanation was that I dreamt it and if that was the case then I would be OK with that too. Something's bugging me on the other hand that it exists...",0,1585657422,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsbzes/looking_for_obscure_scifi_trailerfilm_from_late/,movies,1

fsbuon,chopper5uk,Survey on Streaming Services and Piracy in TV and Movies,"Hi everyone,

Some people might remember that about half a year ago I posted a similar survey on here about Streaming Services and Piracy. If you do remember, it wasn't that great and a few of the questions were actually quite confusing.

But I've now improved that survey and I'm gonna have another crack at posting it here.

It would be much appreciated if you can take 5 minutes of your time as you answer it, but if you don't want to that's fine. I will also make a seperate post with all the data in a few days (weekend maybe?) and a quick analysis of the survey.

Feel free to discuss it, especially on how I can further improve on it.

Without further ado, [here](https://forms.gle/mKvcxX2nF8zPFcQr6) it is.

Thank again.

Positives: Natalie Portman is phenomenal, she gave an extraordinary  preformence,  she was amazing. The directing is very nice and it is scary,  the movie is a physiologic experience.  The cinematography is looking good and the shots are good. The score is great as well, it is powerful, and it works every single time. 
Negatives: Throughout the second act the genre turning could have been done better, it is feeling like two movies sometimes. I would also like more build up to the first act, maybe adding another 10-7 minutes at the very beginning would have improved the movie.
Conclusion: This movie is good, it has flaws but yes, i can call black swan a good movie:

It's not like anyone is making other movies right now! I mean Hollywood has a few that are ready for release and another bulk in post production which can all be finished and released while working at home but after that there not gonna be much else.

As long as the quarantine is in effect there's no filming. So a few of them that were shot are gonna make the 2021 release while others that stopped production are probably gonna be pushed back as well. So the real void in blockbuster movies is gonna come around 2021 - 2022.",160,1585648281,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsa5e5/people_are_concerned_about_this_years_releases/,movies,1

I grew up on a pacific island where, in the 80s anyway, Hong Kong films were a staple, but I don't remember the kid friendliness of them being all that great (I had watched a goodly amount of the classic 80s horror movies by the time I was 10 if that puts it into perspective)... different era.

Anyway, can anyone recommend anything along the 80s Hong Kong movies that are kid friendly - if there are such things?",10,1585647521,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fsa0de/kid_friendly_80s_hong_kong_kind_of_movie_movies/,movies,1

fs9p4i,radiantcumberbadger,"Good Crime, War and Spy Movies : 2000-2020","I'm rewatching 'The Town' 10 years later and it's still one of my favorite movies. Let's share some recommendations!

(I wish I could define my own broad genre for these. Is it Thriller? Anything that gets your heart pumping. 'Spy' is a little slower maybe, but the constant veil of intrigue keeps my attention.)

Crime, mafia, war, heist, spy, thriller, whatever. Go!

* Layer Cake
* Killing Them Softly
* In Bruges
* Sicario 1 + 2
* Zero Dark Thirty
* Baby Driver
* Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy
* Wind River
* Hell or High Water

And my all-time, favorite movie, of all...time:

**Collateral (2004)** \- There is something so Zen about this movie, yet it retains the adrenaline-pumping elements of any action-thriller. Jamie Foxx's first amazing role that I saw, and my personal favorite performance of Tom Cruise's. The cinematography is incredible and I remember reading articles about how it was the first movie filmed on digital, and some of the lighting techniques they used. Despite my total lack of knowledge about filming, I found everything about this movie extremely fascinating.

Runner-up favorite:

**Body of Lies (2008)** \- Bad ass CIA thriller with Leo, Russell Crowe, Mark Strong and one of the most gorgeous actresses I've ever seen (Golshifteh Farahani). I've used up all my descriptive words so I'm just gonna say - go stream it!",10,1585645829,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs9p4i/good_crime_war_and_spy_movies_20002020/,movies,1

Or can I watch 2049 without the context of the original.

fs8sqr,chyeaahbrah,[SPOILERS] The Invisible Man was a super whatever movie and is getting waaaaay overblown reviews,"This whole thing just felt like a long episode of Black Mirror, which is already in itself a series of pretty alright but not incredible (for the most part) series. The concept is believable enough. The acting was pretty alright, but I barely believed it for most of the film, the twist was decently easy to see coming (we knew there were 2 suits, and why would the brother care so much about dealing with cecelia. Immediately thought that was weird), the cgi wasn’t fantastic, her getting super calm and confident in the last 20 minutes wasn’t believable. Best part of the movie was when she hears the phone vibrate in the attic and the whole scene after that up (save for the fact that washing paint off of your head under a faucet wouldn’t look like a paint bomb went off in the sink). Super flawed, but it was decent overall, but not nearly good enough to have people raving about it. I was expecting this to be better than it was, but I’m honestly not surprised that a movie like this would have so many people talking it up as something far better than it is.",15,1585640907,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs8sqr/spoilers_the_invisible_man_was_a_super_whatever/,movies,1

Now that I have finished the book and the movie, while the movie was alright(it was very visually amazing and very well directed), if you enjoyed the film, I would recommend the book. While I'm sure this has been recommended countless times, I can say that having read a good deal of books before the movie (the Martian, the Meg, Robert Langton series, etc...) this one is different enough from the movie that it will keep most engaged till the end and give a good deal more recommendations on other movies, TV shows, etc... that inspired the book.Even if your not a big reader, this one is pretty short and worth the time.",8,1585639431,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs8iko/ready_player_one_movie_v_book/,movies,1

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

fs78i3,MeLikesPineapples,James Gray is a very under-appreciated filmmaker,"After watching his two most recent films, Ad Astra and The Lost City of Z, he is one of my favourite directors now. Both of these films are pretty introspective and have incredible character development. 

His movies tend to be more ethereal and atmospheric. A huge emphasis is placed on the score to hypnotise you. They are definitely not for everyone, but for those who are open to art-house films and have a sense of self-awareness. This way, we can place ourselves in the character's shoes and understand why their goal is so important to them. Ad Asta was advertised heavily and got the wrong audience. The trailer for The Lost City of Z isn't too bad, but gave away a bit too much. Both these movies should definitely be between 7-8 on IMDB, and they are a must watch for film lovers.

I haven't seen James Gray's other films yet, but keen to watch them now. Although the other films don't sound too great upon face value. But, with Gray's direction, expect to get hypnotised.",18,1585632921,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs78i3/james_gray_is_a_very_underappreciated_filmmaker/,movies,1

fs6awo,girafa,"Way late to the party, but I just finished *Terminator: Dark Fate* on DVD","Background: ever since a reviewer spoiled The Sixth Sense for me long ago, I’ve quarantined myself from any media or mentions of films I want to see. If it’s something that particularly interests me, I’ll even eschew trailers. This way, I get to watch films on my own terms, and 100% make up my own mind about them. Only after I watch the movie do I them search and read articles and reviews about them. Even though I wanted to watch this one in the theater, it didn’t happen, so I waited for it to come to Redbox. Which brings us to today.

First of all, I loved the film. I am old enough that the original film was part of my heritage, having lived through the era when global thermonuclear war was an ever-present fear. Terminator and its sequel, Judgment Day, tapped directly into that fear with high-voltage lines and made something incredibly compelling.

I was not at all a fan of Rise of the Machines. Hated it. Without James Cameron, the franchise lost everything, to me. I didn’t mind Salvation, though. I thought it showed some promise, but the fact was that with the Cold War over, the entire storyline seemed dated at that point. I won’t even talk about Genisys or the TV shows.

So here we are today, with Dark Fate having been a box office bomb, even though reviews from both the press and fans has been [mostly positive](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_dark_fate). But this also happened with the original film. T2 only got made because the original became a cult classic via videotape.

I was surprised to learn that [there is a trilogy planned](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/what-happens-terminator-dark-fate-1251736) for this new storyline, and sad to learn that because of the lackluster box office receipts, the sequels most likely won’t be filmed.

I think this is a mistake, and I believe we have the power to change that. Just as fans showed their love for Terminator via rentals after the box office, which gave us the monumental T2, I believe we can spur the realization of this planned trilogy by the same love. If it really exists.

It certainly exists here, in my mind. I hope it does also on a much larger scale. I would absolutely love to see the remainder of the story told on the big screen. It deserves so much more than the small screen and streaming.

After all, the whole point of these great films is that we choose our future. I choose the brilliance of James Cameron and hope to see the final story of Sarah Connor, Dani and Grace shown with the cinematic justice it deserves[.]

The characters are one dimensional and predictable.  The plot is non-sensical, even given its own context.  The movie can't escape its own trappings, like 3-chinned, paunchy white aristicrat is covertly a weapons and martial arts expert.  And even if you look at the symbolism uniquely, wholey ignoring the story in front of you, you still end up with a half-assed realization that only violence can solve economic hardship.  I've barely touched on all the flaws of this film, but I'm so sick of it, having watched about 80%, that I just wanted to tell everyone who recommended it to go fuck themselves.

fs5x7e,_underrated_,Why is Jarmusch's Stranger than paradise so highly acclaimed?,"Just watched this movie and I'm perplexed. I watched Down By Law some time ago by same director and I can say I quite liked it, and Night on earth is one of the most fun movies I watched (amazingly entertaining anthological movie).

 So I see this movie with such high acclaim: 96 on RT, 86 on metascore, 7.5 imdb rating, and the synopsis on iMDB is what made me wanna watch it: ''A New Yorker's life is thrown into a tailspin when his younger cousin surprise visits him, starting a strange, unpredictable adventure.'' This is plotline description. I thought it was gonna be some all-nighter movie where a lot of interesting shit happens in span of a night or day or two (like Scorsese's After Hours for example, or same directors' Night on earth).

 What I got was movie about nothing. About bleakness. About boredom. About 3 people living very mundane lives. There seems no purpose to this movie other than showing almost nothing of any worth. It's basically about 3 people devoid of any personality going to 3 bleak places expecting at everyone something half-interesting, yet nothing interesting happens. Acting in the movie felt shitty, direction didn't seem something to write home about (at least I didn't like all those small weird cuts), and even though nothing interesting happens some parts are just unbelievably hard to fathom (at the ending where this Hungarian chick goes to the beach and some weirdass random drug dealer hands her the money because she was dressed and looked like some other chick that was about to pick the money, I mean that's some ridiculous shit that you'd usually see in some bad comedy movie where most ridiculous scenarios happen). Whole movie I waited for something to happen thinking it's just an overdrawn introduction to some shit that's about to happen, and basically nothing of interest happens, just some ridiculous plotline at the ending. That's it!

You learn that the son and daughter have powers and that's why they are isolating themselves.  

I can't remember exactly but I think one of them ends up accidentally killing the mom(maybe not idk) and so the dad snaps and tries to kill them both, but only succeeds in killing the son and the daughter is able to escape because he lets their bodies float down the river (also could be remembering that wrong as well)

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

fs5b15,VeritasLegion,The Platform Netflix Movie - Digging into the food supply at the heart of the movie,"  \*Spoilers Below\*

&amp;#x200B;

* During the story some participants in the platform such as Imoguiri claim that there would be enough food if everyone on each level only set aside a personal ration for themselves or the next person down the pit and refused to gorge on additional food.
   * &gt;!This premise appears to be false when, later on in the story, we see that there are not only 250 levels, but 333. It is arguable that the food, even when rationed, could not possibly last until level 250 and feed 500 people.!&lt;
   * Space on the platform is very limited and a lot of room is taken up by plates and fancy preparation style of the food as if it were a 5-star restaurant. &gt;!The normal food allocation was usually depleted by the 100 or so level. There were another 233 levels or 466 people that still would require food if all levels were occupied. !&lt; You could make the argument that there would be no way for subsistence level of food supplies to reach the bottom level.
   * &gt;!If the platform was full to the 250th level, that is 500 plates worth of food that would need to be on the platform. For the 333rd level, that is 666 plates (nice number choice for the number of inmates). The platform appears to be large enough to place maybe 250 plates if they are not stacked on top of each other but you would have to freezeframe to get an accurate total.!&lt; How much food does a human being need to survive at the most basic level, 150-300 calories a day?
      * The portions that Imoguiri puts on the two plates did not appear to be enough to sustain a human being for a prolonged period of time. Some inmates such as Trimagasi are up there for a year or more. The members imprisoned for prolonged periods under the rationing system would eventually become malnourished and die. With an unknown number of members staying in the prison for more than a few months it also wouldn’t be practical for the people in the prison to starve themselves for a short period with the belief they can eat again when they get out, many would not last in that scenario.
      * All in all, the insufficient food supply makes me wonder if the whole system was set up to have the people kill each other off, why else have 2 people per room instead of 1? The system needn't concern itself with the class like separation or the ability of the prisoners to work together. The people that created the setup of the pit don’t even need to rely on the people on the top to overindulge in eating, they would simply know that no matter what anyone did, people will starve. It is a very dark set up - is this a representation of hell?",11,1585624318,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs5b15/the_platform_netflix_movie_digging_into_the_food/,movies,1

Perhaps the general lack of CGI (and focus on practical effects) helps, but even the CGI (when used) is beautiful.

Peter Jackson has a knack for making large, epic battle scenes. The Battle for Helms Deep was one of the most insane battle scenes on film, and the sheer scope of The Battle of Pellenor Fields is jaw dropping. 

The acting? Superb. The story? Obviously, thanks to JRR Tolkein, is wonderful. The visuals? Still holding up some 20 years later.

The Hobbit films aren't bad per se, but they truly do live in the shadows of LoTR. Especially with the excessive CGI use and extra stories. Again, I do love The Hobbit, but they won't achieve the timeless masterpiece status that LoTR has.

I remember the movie taking place in some small Asian village (think rural; stone, dirt, etc.) that was obviously affected by some war or conflict (Not positive on this, but it's probably some recent conflict given I remember it being set in some modern context).

The two young girls lived securely in their own house with their mother. I remember there being a male figure in their lives, but he was distant and maybe abusive.

The core of the story is about the two young girls (less than 5 years old). Despite the conflict, the girls were lively and vibrant.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

Everything was filmed right up in the actors face, then add the dramatic spin around the actor effect. 

Cameron Diaz was pointless. 

Pacino and the hooker was pointless. 

Willie Beamen was a dick to literally everyone 95% of the movie and all of sudden he's a leader and the team/coach love him? Shitty writing. 

The eyeball on the field was ridiculously stupid.

Willie Creamin Steamin Beamen's music video.

Lawrence Taylor's cortezone scene was cringey, as was all his acting.

They could have just made the final game a close one without adding the Kit conflict. Or even invented another entirely different problem. I just find myself wanting to fast forward all the Kit parts.

fs203x,TheGmork_,"In times like this, speeches from movie presidents are much more relatable","Some examples:

&gt;I address you tonight not as the President of the United States, not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity. We are faced with the very gravest of challenges. The Bible calls this day ""Armageddon""; the end of all things. And yet, for the first time in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction. All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service.
The human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle. Through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls, and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
[...]May we all, citizens the world over, see these events through. Godspeed, and good luck to you.

[Armageddon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkM88GnQN8M)

&gt;We can't be consumed by our petty differences any more. We will be united in our common interest. [...] you will once again be fighting for our freedom. Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution, but from annihilation. We're fighting for our right to live, to exist and should we win the day, the 4th of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one voice, 'We will not go quietly into the night! We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on, we're going to survive.' Today we celebrate our independence day!""

Just replace ""4th of July"" or ""Independence Day"" with something like ""corona-vaccine-day""

''Titanic'' from 1997 still feels new to me. Titanic still looks clean and new, it holds up very well. I can't wrap my head around the fact that Titanic is a 23 year old movie.

Movies from 2001 and 2002 like ''Harry Potter'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the first ''Spider Man'' also still feel like new movies. These movies are about to turn 20 years old. It can't be.

fs1mkr,constantino2,"So, was back to the future deterministic time travel or not?","It seems to go back and forth...

For instance, the movie insinuates that Marty loops back to teach Chuck berry the song that Marty heard from chuck berry.

He also seems to inspire the mayor to become mayor and his parents to name him marty.

Is that to say all 3 things would have happened without Marty seeding them to happen?

We know that BTTF2 indicates that backwards time travel rewrites the future time line... suggesting that these 3 events must have been inevitable to occur.

fs0to3,Gattsu2000,"I Recently Saw ""Portrait Of A Lady On Fire"" And I Personally Did Not Enjoy It","I really wanted to love this so much more but I never felt it, honestly.

But first, let me start with the positives:

I think the cinematography is consistently great throughout the film and there are times where it just looks so fucking stunny. The cinematography in the beach scenes are just beautiful to look at. I also really like the music in this. It's also nice to see a film that does some pretty nice lesbian representation. Not to mention that it does not fall to oversexualization or the male gaze. It's just appropriately sexual in how the characters express their love, which is very nice.

However, when it comes to the rest, well, it's not so good. I do not necessarily feel very bored watching it but something about it really was missing. I couldn't exactly to what was going on as I was expecting to. There are long moments where the characters are just walking or doing something which just really consumed a lot of time and just keeps me disconnected from the experience. This goes for a really long while with the film. The problem is that it just wasted too much time on these moments and it just keeps making the experience not particularly satisfying nor are these moments presented in such a great way for me to keep on watching them without wanting more from it. And it's not like I am against slow-paced films. I mean, ""Angel's Egg"" is my 4th favorite film, one which really takes its time and where there are little eventful things occurring in it but this film was able to keep me very engaged as it uses that to its advantage to build up atmosphere and making the experience feel calming and uncomfortable rather than tedious. The performances are also just fine. They are rather dull and do not express that much emotions in the exceptions of a few scenes (Although, in one of them, which happens around the end, felt like it was rather overacted, which just makes it look as if the woman is about to have a panic attack for listening to music. I mean, the music is beautiful but you do not need to act this way. It just makes it unintentionally funny.) And while I did like how it shows an example of abortion, I felt it had little purpose in the narrative itself. It felt it was just thrown in there and then was just later abandoned. It felt like a rather little unnecessary And underdeveloped plot point and that it had little to say. And the 2 main leads... had very little chemistry. It's nice to have lesbians being represented. In fact, this is what I really want more from films. I love that a film explores sexuality and stuff. But I honestly did not believe in the love of these characters. They barely know each other and they do not have any particularly strong interactions with each other. And the scene where they argue against each other felt rather petty and underwhelming. It's just that their relationship isn't interesting for me to care what's going with them. For a movie about love, I really cannot see the passion and care that both main leads for each other. Just being homosexual isn't enough to make their relationship an interesting one.

So anyways, yeah. I was extremely disappointed by this film and I am very surprised this is considered one of the best films of this year. It was very dull to watch and only things it had for it was some nice cinematography and music.

fs0fit,Solefyre,"Bad Boys for Life, Rambo Last Blood, Terminator Dark Fate, etc all have large speaking parts in other languages."," Why is this a thing now in major motion pictures? 

I preferred the old days when everyone spoke a set language throughout the movie and  nationality was shown with accents. Now I have to read subtitles and  divert attention just to follow along in various parts of newer movies. The above mentioned movies all have fairly large segments that were entirely spoken in Spanish. Even the John Wick movies had sections that were entirely spoke in Russian, though those were fortunately short in length. It's not a problem of subtitles moving too fast, it just takes away from the immersive-ness of the movie having to look away from the focus of the screen to the text at the bottom. 

Why has there recently been a shift into bilingual movies and will this become the new norm for Hollywood?",21,1585606163,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fs0fit/bad_boys_for_life_rambo_last_blood_terminator/,movies,1
fs0fer,chris20194,covering a time span shorter than screen time?,"My brother joked about how boring movies would be if they ran in real time. Imagine just watching the protagonist riding the bus for 10 minutes. But this got me thinking: All movies and series i can think of cover a longer time span than their actual screen time, sometimes years or even centuries. But what about the opposite? Imagine a 2h movie covering a time span of a mere minute, but in utmost detail. Screen time can be filled with stuff like slowmo, different perspectives, narrations, monologues, ect. There's lots of creative potential. I can't be the first to have this idea, are there any movies/series like that?

fs0f3p,Quibbloboy,It's time for Pixar to start remaking their old movies.,"In 1995, Pixar released the first ever feature-length 3D-animated film, Toy Story. It was groundbreaking for its time, an incredible, unprecedented landmark in filmmaking. Not only was it a technological achievement, Toy Story was simply an amazing movie in terms of writing, direction, and voice acting – by many accounts, it was considered near-flawless upon release. In almost every regard, it holds up as a masterpiece today. The only area that hasn't withstood the test of time quite as well is the animation.

From the modern perspective, Toy Story looks... a little rough. Jerky movements, blurry textures, [that dog](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/5/5e/Scud-personnage-toy-story-06.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190110222703). The animation was cutting-edge in 1995, but graphics technology has come an extremely long way since then, and Pixar's old movies are starting to show their age. And unfortunately, freshening them up for 2020 isn't quite as simple as just de-graining old footage and releasing them in 4K, like you can with many traditionally-animated movies. This is becoming noticeable in more and more of Pixar's old films as technology grows up around them.

That's why Pixar needs to start remaking movies.

They wouldn't have to touch the blocking or the script. They could leave the audio and voice lines alone completely; it would just be a reanimation of the original movie. Imagine Toy Story 1 looking like Toy Story 4, with its smooth movements, crystal-clear textures, and [that cat](https://www.slashfilm.com/wp/wp-content/images/Toy-Story-4-TV-spot-cat.jpg). It would be cheaper to produce than a whole new movie, and it would *probably sell more tickets, too*.

You see this all the time in video games, the *other* medium where 3D graphics are a central component. Only it would be even more straightforward than a remake of a video game – which typically addresses flaws and adds content – since the other aspects of Pixar's movies are still so solid.

I've been saying this for years, but now that Pixar's catalogue is so readily available on Disney+, the contrast between their old (functional) animation and their new (industry-leading, world-class, breathtaking) animation is more apparent than ever. It would be a service to these aging movies to freshen them up for the modern era.

fs0el3,flipperkip97,[SPOILERS] The Handmaiden (2016) is so. Damn. Good.,"THERE'S SPOILERS HERE! GO WATCH THE MOVIE FOR YOURSELF IF YOU HAVEN'T YET! IT'S QUITE GOOD! 

I just watched The Handmaiden earlier today and I'm blown away by how good it is. I think it might actually be the best film I have ever seen. Everything about it just amazing. The cinematography is especially gorgeous. And I can't get [this music](https://youtu.be/8Ek4rbmblbI) out of my head. I tear up everytime I listen to it. 

The first twist really got me. I felt so bad for Sook-hee... I don't think I've ever hoped for a happy ending as much as I did while watching this film. And thank fuck I got one. It was so satisfying and beautiful. It genuinely lifted my spirits. 

I'm normally not into romantic films at all, but holy shit, this one is so good. I know it's not exactly a hot take, so maybe this post is a bit pointless, but I just had to vent a bit. I only have one friend who is kinda into movies and he usually sticks to the mainstream American blockbusters (nothing wrong with that), so he wasn't very interested.

I mean... WHAT!. Ok, even if the film wasn't to your taste and you're not a fan of slow-build horror pictures or horror full stop, I believe you could still accept that The Witch was phenomenally well acted. Simply by being able to give voice to the characters with a script using archaic, period--accurate, language deserves recognition; but even the young child actors were great. This is without yet mentioning Anya Taylor-Joy and Ralph Ineson who were both emotionally captivating.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

The case in New York is resolved. I was not his attorney on that case. Although it should have been completely dismissed, as it was for the other 2 individuals in the same car, who testified that @kodakblack knew nothing about the firearm in the vehicle, and it was registered and legal to one of the other individuals he was with, they agreed to 12 month to run concurrent with his current sentence. Even the Judge asked the prosecutor why are they not dismissing. @kodakblack just wanted to resolve it so he doesn&amp;#39;t lose anytime in federal. You see when you are out of federal custody you lose that time on your federal case. Now with the Coronavirus, its unknown when they will pick him up due to this virus. The BUREAU OF PRISONS @bureauofprisons needs to address these issues that federal inmates are credited back time they miss due to this outbreak. More information to follow this, as we really need to delve deep into how @kodakblack is being treated differently than any other inmate and any other defendant. Next up we will discuss what I say is triple jeopardy and the holding off on charges to attempt to stack a defendant with extra time, like in the case in @saomiami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;""&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=""https://www.instagram.com/lawronin/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading"" style="" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;"" target=""_blank""&gt; Bradford Cohen&lt;/a&gt; (@lawronin) on &lt;time style="" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;"" datetime=""2020-03-30T13:50:19+00:00""&gt;Mar 30, 2020 at 6:50am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=""//www.instagram.com/embed.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;`",0,1585604040,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frzrjn/sdsd/,movies,1

As the title says, I'm curious to see how this movie is viewed by people closer to the subject matter.

The Karate Kid has been hailed as a movie that deals with bullying but Daniel wasn't being bullied, far from it. 

When you're bullied, you're a victim of unprovoked attacks. Johnny and the Cobra Kai weren't mistreating Daniel because they had fun in picking on the weak. Daniel is the one who started a fight with Johnny when he meddled in a private discussion. Johnny and Ali were having a fight, Daniel butts in and tries to show off and gets his ass kicked. Then he tries to get his revenge by going into a dojo to learn Karate, gets shamed when he enters the Cobra Kai lair and then insists on hanging around Ali, making it difficult for Johnny and Ali into getting back together. Had Daniel kept to himself, the Cobra Kai wouldn't have picked on him but he choose to be a smart aleck by trying to steal someone else's girl . 

There's only one moment in the movie where I thought Johnny was wrong was when the Cobra Kai beat up Daniel. That was cowardly.

Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

frvtwl,Diechswigalmagee,"I Watched all 9 Fast &amp; Furious Movies So You Don't Have To (They Really Weren't That Bad, Honestly)","So, times changed pretty quick, eh? I already miss going to the theatre, I’m a relatively frequent traveller so that has also been hard. But I’m managing, and part of that is going to be putting some of these out! For people that haven’t seen my posts before, I mostly just voice my opinions on the internet about a group or series of films that I just watched (or, in some cases, rewatched) and then read people complain about those opinions! It’s fun! If you want some other examples, [here’s one I did for *The Grudge* series]( https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/ekov22/i_watched_the_entire_12_film_backlog_of_grudge/) and [here’s another for *Jurassic Park*]( https://www.reddit.com/r/flicks/comments/fo3w49/i_watched_all_the_jurassic_park_films_so_you_dont/). Thank you to u/Mattastic92 for suggesting this series! I’m always open to suggestions as to what series to pursue next! Quick rules on this one though: I’m only counting main installments and Hobbs &amp; Shaw. No shorts or *Better Luck Tomorrow* here, folks. Also, scores are relevant only to this post (and I will try to remember adding this disclaimer to all future posts). This means that if a film gets a 10 here, it isn’t necessarily a 10 in all films past, present and future. Why? Well, it allows films to be compared on an even playing field (no *Fast and Furious* movie will be comparable to *The Godfather*, for instance) and for a much better ratings distribution among films listed (because most *Fast and Furious* movies would be in the 3-6 range if you include all films, which makes for a boring list of 4s and 5s all the way down. It makes it easier on me and a better indication for you). 

Anyway, on with the show! Let’s talk *Fast &amp; Furious*! 

**The Fast and The Furious (2001)**

. . . Bleh. You know, I’m already regretting doing *Fast &amp; Furious*. I had never seen any of these films for a reason. They just always look so cheesy and silly and not really what I’m about at all. I don’t mind stupid, nonsensical movies, but the acting and dialogue always looked so . . . bad. And street racing never really interested me at all. 

And, well, this didn’t change my mind.

See, I was expecting this to be a dumb action movie. I was expecting it to be about relatively generic bro types talking about family, and a quarter mile, and robberies. What I wasn’t expecting was how dull this movie would be. This film is literally about *nothing*. The “big twist” comes halfway through, which is also the first point that the plot starts happening, but even after that point it feels like the movie is dragging its feet up until the last 15 minutes or so, when suddenly the screenwriter screams “we gotta get some sort of resolution” before cobbling together a way for the good guys to win and the “bad guys” (in quotations because honestly with less than 20 mins of screen time I never really felt any threat from them) to lose.

Okay, but like, what about the cars, right? And the iconic cast? Well, yeah, the cars are cool I guess. Again, I’m hardly a car guy. As for the cast, they have good bones. I liked Dom well enough (Vin Diesel is a seriously underrated actor), but the rest of the cast are mostly bland and forgettable. I can’t even remember most of their names. But, again, good bones. A lot of them seem like they can improve if given a wider range of emotions to work with. It remains to be seen whether they will or not.

Finally, the camera work in this movie is so goddamn shaky most of the races gave me a headache. It was a blurry, shitty mess of a movie. I hope it only goes up from here

**3/10** **Moment of the Film:** As much as I ripped into this one, I have to admit the transport truck scene near the end of the movie was pretty great. It reminded me of *Fury Road*, which y’all should watch instead of this pile of puppy poopoo.

**2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)**

What a shitty title. Like, what movie has the nerve to use “2” as a pun not once, but twice? That just screams “cash grab.” “Studio mandated sequel.” Hell, they could’ve called it *Fast and Furious 2: Faster and Furiouser* and it would be better than *2 Fast 2 Furious*. Nothing makes me want to watch a movie less than a garbage title like this.

So, imagine my surprise when this movie ended up not being that bad at all. Whoa. Total 180, eh? Gave ya some whiplash?

Look, I’m not going to argue that this is a good movie. The plot is nonsense, most of the characters are badly acted throwaways. The entire film is just trying to find more and more ridiculously contrived ways to get Paul Walker behind a wheel. It doesn’t even have Dom, the shining bright spot of the last film. But, relatively speaking, there is significant enough improvement here to warrant this being considered a film on the good end of bad. I mean, for one thing this movie actually has a plot, which is a step up. Sure, it might not make the most sense, but it’s there. Beginning to end. And it might have worse acting overall, but at least the main cast aren’t cardboard cut-outs of human beings anymore (Brian went from 0 to 100 on the scale of “potential of being an actual real human being if you squint a little,” which is probably the closest thing to a ringing endorsement I can give to any character in this series thus far). There’s even some humour here, which is a nice change of pace.

But, like I said, the plot and characters are mostly just vehicles to get people in . . . well . . . vehicles. And *2 Fast 2 Furious* delivers on that end as well. I’m not a huge believer in ramping things up to 11 for the sequel, but man this series needed it. The first movie had too much talking about racing but not enough actual racing. Here, we hit a nice middle ground. There are still some quieter moments (to serve up a nice dose of plot, this time around), but there is significantly more fast and furious driving here than in the original film, and that’s a good thing. When you are making a movie about street racing, it’s probably a good idea to add in some street racing. Also, this time the camera work wasn’t headache inducing! Who would’ve thought how nice that would be?

**5/10** **Moment of the Film:** As much as I liked the races in general, the best one comes at the very beginning. You get a good sense of *most* of the main cast from it, and it is a lot of fun to boot!

**The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)**

Oops. Looks like any goodwill the last film gained just got tossed out the window.

This movie irks me in a similar fashion to the first film. The characters are bland and forgettable, the plot id basically non-existent up until the last 20 minutes or so (I’ll give it credit though, this one does hype up the bad guy a bit better), and the writing is godawful. I mean, even the basic concept stretches the realm of believability a bit, but then you add in that this guy goes to a Japanese high school and doesn’t speak Japanese? And there are a whole bunch of foreigners at this specific Japanese high school? Japan, one of the most racially homogenous countries in the world. What are the odds? Then, the movie has the gall to make *every single Japanese person* in this film a villain, except for the one dude who is a “senpai” to the main white dude, yet another stereotype. Like, why set your movie in Tokyo if you’re going to make your main cast decidedly not Japanese and all the Japanese dudes baddies? The Yakuza are spread all over the world, you literally could’ve set this film in Houston and it would’ve been the exact same movie.

Oh wait, then you couldn’t point out how crazy weird and wacky Japan is! I get it now! Wow, Japanese people eat sushi?? Holy! There are vending machines in Japan?? I’ll be darned! It gets even worse when you realize that the entire movie hinges on a guy liking a girl who is dating one of the Japanese dudes. So it is, in essence, a white saviour movie. A bad look even for 2006.

Let’s talk about the main guy for a second. He looks like a discount Eminem. He talks like a discount Forrest Gump. He’s completely clueless. And he’s got the personality of a particularly antisocial turnup. This guy almost never smiles, never jokes around. His only defining trait is “serious man.” In fact, the whole film is pretty devoid of any comedy, which is a bad sign for one this ridiculous.

At the end of the day, this is just a bad rehash of the original. And that’s saying something.

**1/10** **Moment of the Film:** DK beating the shit out of Sean. So satisfying. 

**Fast &amp; Furious (2009)**

A lot of people consider this a soft reboot of the series rather than a sequel. I’ll go a step further and say that this is a soft remake of the first two films, with a lot of stuff changed or omitted. I mean, the entire concept is back to square one. Brian is a cop at odds with Dom, then Brian is tracking a narcotics dealer. This time with Dom instead of .  . . uh . . . the guy from the second movie. Whatever his name was. It’s basically like they took the first two films and smashed them together, while adding enough connective tissue to make it a sequel instead of an exact remake. They even named it in such a way that people could see this and think of it as the first film.

In other words, a soft remake.

What’s the point of the preamble? Well, because most of this review will be a comparison between this and the first two films, and needless to say this movie does almost everything better. See, they took the good parts of the first film (Dom, basically, but also the bones of Brian and Mia—this time with some skin), most of the good parts of the second film (the smoother action, good acting, and actually having a plot), and a dash of Western influences, then tossed it all into a blender. What came out was a delicious smoothie of the best *Fast and Furious* film yet. 

Really, the only thing lost in translation is the humour, which by and large falls flatter than a pancake here. But so much of this film works that it’s hard to miss it. Finally, *finally*, we get buttery smooth camera work, fun characters, and a movie that has just enough action and quieter moments.

Oh, did I not mention? This movie is probably the slowest paced *Fast and Furious* film since the original, but it finally works! Because the plot exists and the characters are somewhat interesting this time around, we want to hear what they have to say. Go figure! It was even probably a big risk, because the movie does all this by excising a large percentage of its usually substantial secondary cast. Hey, movie, it paid off in spades! By focusing on only a few characters, it lets those characters shine in ways they otherwise wouldn’t.

Oh, and Shea Whigham was there. I like him.

*I feel it is now time to make clear again that my numerical scores are relevant within each post only. The reason I do this is because you are then only comparing apples to apples, rather than apples to pineapples, bananas, oranges, pears, grapefruit, scones, walnuts, fried baloney, chocolate milk, and spotted dick. The scores I give these films are in no way indicative of their quality overall, just their quality relative to each other*

**8/10** **Moment of the Film:** The chase across the border. I mean, that’s some *Mad Max* meets Spaghetti Western shit right there. It blew me away how well that sequence worked in comparison to literally everything that came before.

**Fast Five (2011)**

It's funny, this movie does the exact opposite of the previous film’s biggest strength: it has a large, unwieldy cast. Strangely enough though, that ends up being *Fast Five*’s greatest asset. 

Because a smart cookie in the writers room realized that *Fast &amp; Furious* is the perfect setup for a heist movie.

And man, it works. The whole gang getting together (seriously, we have secondary characters from every single prior installment) just feels right in a strange way. Han and Giselle feels like a match made in Heaven. Roman showing back up with Tej is a big moment, and their chemistry brings with it some of the humour that elevated the second film. Putting all of these characters in a room and letting them breathe makes for some fantastic acting choices and moments.

Unfortunately, this means a few things suffer. Firstly, the racing. In fact, this movie doesn’t seem at all interested in what defined the series only two films ago and has been an integral part of it since the beginning (the only drag racing scene is extraordinarily short and serves no plot function). Similarly, the action set pieces are mostly left to the last 20 minutes of the film, and that’s fine because when they finally come it’s a huge payoff (this is a heist movie after all, the cliché is a long movie with a lot of talking and a big payoff), but I wish there was just a bit more meat in the center of the film.

Speaking of lack of meat, there is a major problem with filler in this movie. The first half hour is almost entirely filler, with basically no meaningful progression in the plot or characters. Luckily, things for the most part pick up after that point, but unfortunately there is still the issue with the Luke Hobbs character.

And, here’s the crux of the issue with *Fast Five*, what separates it from superseding or even matching its predecessor: Luke Hobbs. Don’t get me wrong, I like Dwayne Johnson when he’s at his A-Game.

He wasn’t at his A-Game here.

Johnson plays Hobbs very straight-faced, with almost no emotion given in the performance. He almost seems to be reading the lines off a page. But, the critical sin of Luke Hobbs in this film? He doesn’t add anything. We already have a tough guy on screen in the form of Dom, and we even have a (rogue) FBI agent in the form of Brian. In terms of plot, Hobbs adds nothing that couldn’t have been done by any other character. His arc doesn’t add anything to the overarching plot, and he himself seems to pose very little threat to Dom and his crew. He’s mostly just there, eating screen time. Luke Hobbs is literally the personification of “filler.”

All that said though, *Fast Five*’s overall strong plot and cast of characters lift the film up significantly, even though buckets of filler try to knock it down. It may not be as good as *Fast &amp; Furious* can be, but it’s in the upper half for sure.

**7/10** **Moment of the Film:** The heist. It may take a while to get there, but the main set piece of this film doesn’t disappoint.

*Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013)*

Weirdly the last *Fast &amp; Furious* film to have both the words “fast” and “furious” in the title, the 6th film in the franchise improves upon its immediate predecessor in a couple ways but ultimately falls a bit short of the mark.

Right off the bat, it’s important to note that this film focuses *hard* on Luke Hobbs. Like, the movie (while ostentatiously about the search for Letty) basically sidelines the three main characters to focus on Hobbs, using Han, Roman, and the other major members of the crew as comedic side characters. Even though this is a pretty personal story for Dom, he has very little to do up until the final act. Brian has his own short segment basically to himself that goes absolutely nowhere, and other than that he’s completely sidelined. And Mia is AWOL for almost the entire movie. Hobbs, and Hobbs alone, does almost all the heavy lifting in this film.

This would be a major issue if Hobbs was the same Hobbs as in *Fast Five*. Thankfully, he’s not. This Hobbs is more resourceful, threatening, emotional, and, dare I say, funny than the previous portrayal. Johnson really gives the character his all this time around, so much so that I can finally see how he eventually gets his own spin off film down the line.

This film also solves the pacing problem with *Fast Five*, by basically being a roller coaster. Is it the perfect solution? No, but it certainly makes it more fun.

So, what’s the Achilles heel this time around? Well, the hokey plot, basically. I mean this is the third film with the “do X for ‘The Man’ and you’re free” plotline, and it plays out almost beat for beat as you would expect. There’s no real “twist,” per say, it’s basically your average *Mission: Impossible* episode type plot, and it doesn’t even really do it well. The MacGuffin here is never explained very well so the stakes never feel high enough, and Luke Evan’s Owen Shaw never really comes across as a brilliant tactician or a physical threat to our hulking bro dudes. He’s mostly just a slimy, forgettable terrorist, and that sucks. The *Fast* series hasn’t really had a notable villain yet, I hope that changes.

And, finally, let’s talk about Letty. Letty is back! With a bunch of caveats. See, for one she has amnesia (the laziest plot device in the world) and is working for the bad guys (*also* the laziest plot device in the world) and all of this is in service of getting the now-uber-famous Michelle Rodriguez to come back to the role. And that really blows, because frankly as good as Rodriguez is she was never a central character. She was a somewhat memorable side character in the first film that was overshadowed by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince. Then she was in the fourth film for less than ten minutes. Now she’s back. Like, okay, fine. I get she was a fan favourite of sorts. But she was hardly essential, and the movies have been fine without her. Her inclusion here feels like a lazy way to up the stakes with every cliché imaginable, and that sucks. I wish they could’ve used a different character in a similar manner, like that girl Dom was dating at the beginning. Or an already morally grey character like Roman or Tej.

Oh, and Shea Whigham was back. Good dude.

**6/10** **Moment of the Film:** The tank sequence gets a lot of love, but that cargo plane sequence at the end (for all its breaking the laws of physics and general ridiculousness) takes the cake for me

**Furious 7 (2015)**

There are a lot of reasons why this is considered the best *Fast &amp; Furious* movie.

One of them, obviously—and let’s address the elephant in the room early—was Paul Walker’s untimely demise. *Furious 7*, being only partially completed at the time of his death, serves as a tribute to him. This was his series, really, as much as Vin Diesel is the star of the show. Brian O’Connor has been the main viewpoint character since day one and imagining the series without him is impossible.

All that being said, if this had to be the last movie Paul Walker did, at least it was a great one.

I’m not saying that this is Oscar-worthy or anything, but as far as action movies go this is pretty high up in the upper echelon, just a couple steps below *Die Hard*. I give a lot of kudos to James Wan for that. Justin Lin is a good director and he did some pretty amazing stuff with the series, but James Wan has an eye for detail like few other directors working today. He has elevated anything he has touched so that even his worst films (*Dead Silence*) are at least very good from a directorial standpoint. He may be known for horror, but *Furious 7* proves that he isn’t a one-trick pony.

The film also succeeds because it’s really the first film to strike a great balance between the drama of *Fast &amp; Furious* and over the top shenanigans of *Fast Five* and *Fast &amp; Furious 6*. This movie really zeroes in on Dom and Brian in a way that very few of the films have been able to do. It analyses them as people, men, and fathers, not just as action heroes. It helps that the side characters remain side characters this time around, with only Letty really getting much of a spotlight outside of the two main men. It wouldn’t work for every film of the series, we gotta care about the other characters somewhat, but for this one film it’s nice to have a bit of a break. It’s also nice that it’s overall such a small cast; really only Dom, Brian, Letty, Tej and Roman, with a few new faces (I’ll get to them in a bit) and Mia and Lucas having extended cameos. I wish we got to see a bit more of Mia, but otherwise I have no complaints.

But when the shooting starts, it really starts. I would say on the whole this is *slightly* more restrained than *Fast &amp; Furious 6*, but there’s one specific sequence that kind of combines the big bombastic action setpiece from 3 separate films into one mega-setpiece that blows all that came before out of the water. It isn’t my moment of the film, but man it was close. What other movie has a single sequence that includes parachuting, driving, and cliff-hanging?

Finally, the new characters. *Fast &amp; Furious* has an issue where they gain a slew of new characters in each film and they are either unlikable or underutilized, then they bring back a select few later on to add depth. They’ve done this with, off the top of my head, Gisele, Lucas, Han, and Tej, at least. 

Not so with *Furious 7*.

There are really only 3 “new characters” in this film, besides some background people who will likely not return. They are Ramsey, Mr. Nobody, and Deckard Shaw, and each have their strengths. Mr. Nobody is something of a G-Man character that this series desperately needed, it was getting tiring that each new installment created a character to represent “The Man,” and he is enigmatic enough that there is an added sense of intrigue which is fun. Deckard Shaw is similarly well-needed, we finally get a truly memorable villain who is both physically and mentally fit to face Dom and his team (though it is still a bit unbelievable that he beat the shit out of Hobbs). And Ramsey is . . . well, Ramsey is the exception to the rule. And that’s fine, every film has a small fault.

Guys, honestly *Furious 7* is unironically a fantastic film. On a global scale it would be at least a 7 or an 8. It’s the best action movie I’ve seen in a long time.

So, in a direct comparison with the rest of the series I have to give it a . . .

**10/10** **Moment of the Film:** I was crying at that ending, man. That hits hard. Well done, *Fast &amp; Furious*. Well done.

**The Fate of the Furious (2017)**

I think the biggest challenge that this movie faced was trying to create a *Fast &amp; Furious* film without Brian O’Connor. Its biggest mistake was trying to do it without Dominic Toretto as well.

Don’t get me wrong, Dom’s here, but he is far different than the Dom we usually see. His optimism is gone. His resourcefulness is also gone. He’s mostly been reduced to a walking mass of flesh, something akin to Hobbs from *Fast Five*. It just feels . . . off. This should be Dom’s film, it’s the first one where he doesn’t really have a second-in-command. Instead, he is skipped over for Hobbs and Shaw.

And unfortunately, both these characters suffer similar fates. Hobbs is fine, he’s similar enough to his prior portrayals, but he just doesn’t develop much here. He’s pretty predictable at this point. Shaw, on the other hand, gets ruined here. All the edge that made him such a great villain last outing is gone, now he’s mostly just a jackass with a big heart. Not unlike Hobbs, or Dom at times. Or Brian.

The rest of the cast is similarly flawed. Tej is the same as usually. Ramsey goes nowhere. Roman is cracking the same jokes but with none of his usual vigour. The only character that actually improves here is Letty, who actually shows a much broader range of emotions and is a joy to watch.

Mr. Nobody is back and continues to steal scenes, but his younger counterpart feels like a bad replacement for Brian. He’s kind of an idiot and ruins a lot of the scenes he’s in. I hope he doesn’t return, but this isn’t a series known for letting characters leave.

Finally, there’s the villain this time around, Cipher. Charlize Theron does good with what she’s given, but her plan just never makes too much sense (even for a series that regularly bends the laws of reality) and she never seems to pose much of a threat to any of our heroes. She’s kind of more of a scheming presence, which doesn’t work that well in a series known for very physical fights. She’s also very dry, and her constant monologuing about nothing slows the pace right down. She isn’t the worst *Fast &amp; Furious* villain, but she isn’t notable.

Her plan involving nuclear launch codes and an EMP bomb isn’t just ridiculous, it also doesn’t make for great plotting. Nothing about the plot this time around feels realistic or earned, and it just feels like constant escalation for the sake of constant escalation. High stakes? Yes, but we never really feel that. It’s probably the worst *Fast &amp; Furious* film in terms of plot, and that includes the movies that barely have one.

All that said, this isn’t the worst *Fast &amp; Furious* film, but it’s close. It sucks that it did away with all the good will the series had earned up to this point, but it at least had the main cast present. That’s why it ends up just above the only film to have none of the current main cast present (except Dom—sorta).

**2/10** **Moment of the Film:** This movie really sucks when the characters are in cars, but the prison sequence featuring Hobbs and Shaw is actually really great—and is the only moment in the film where both characters feel like their previous, better, portrayals.

**Hobbs &amp; Shaw (2019)**

It’s Black Superman vs Samoan Thor!

Look, this movie is batshit insane. The plot revolves around a fight between a cyborg, a former pro wrestler, and two scrawny Brits. So why is it so dang good (for the first two thirds of the film)? Well, mostly because even though the plot is ludicrous even by *Fast &amp; Furious* standards, this movie hits high notes from cast alone.

We have Idris Elba, one of the best actors currently working in Hollywood who doesn’t even have to do much to be amazing. We have Ryan Reynolds, who is amazing at playing Ryan Reynolds and he does a great job here. We have Vanessa Kirby, who is arguably the best *Furious* girl yet (she kicks ass in a way that Letty can only dream of). We have Dwayne Johnson, who completely swings the “big guy with a big heart” way this time around and it really works with the insanity going on around him. And we even have Jason Statham, who I am admittedly not usually a fan of but he’s much closer to his original character here and honestly steals a lot of the bits in this film. Who knew he was so funny?

Speaking of bits, this movie is full of them. It kind of tries to make up for its less than stellar plot by just putting the characters in rooms together and getting them to insult each other, with decent results. It does get old after a while, but most of the best moments come from these bits rather than the action, and you do miss it when the movie crawls to its third act.

Ah, and now the crux of the issue with this movie. The problem that separates it from hitting at least the relative heights of *Fast Five*. It just can’t stick the landing. As I said, unlike a lot of the *Fast* movies, this movie’s strengths are not in its action. In fact, I’m pretty sure none of the best moments even contain violence (maybe one, the two hallways separated by glass was fun). So it’s a bit disappointing when the film finally devolves into the third act action set piece that everyone knew was coming. Yeah, okay, it’s a bit . . . shall we say . . . untraditional? But it’s still bonkers like most other final acts in this series, and considering this film took some other risks (no Dom?? This late in the game, that in itself was a big risk) I really wish it could’ve had a different, maybe even somewhat quieter, third act. It can still have action, even! I’m just thinking less *Avengers* and more *Guardians of the Galaxy*, if you get what I’m saying.

That said, I’m surprised that I would still sit down and rewatch *Hobbs and Shaw* if given the opportunity. It really wasn’t half bad, and even with a messy third act it still easily is one of the better *Fast &amp; Furious* films.

**6.5/10** **Moment of the Film:** Could it really be anything but the *over two minute long* sequence of Hobbs and Shaw “reconnecting” near the beginning of the film? I don’t think so.",50,1585591606,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frvtwl/i_watched_all_9_fast_furious_movies_so_you_dont/,movies,1

frv5nb,Zolaaaa,Do you consider Road Warrior to be a dystopian or a post-apocalyptic film?,"Might be a completely irrelevant question, or a controversial opinion to some, but I don't consider Road Warrior to be a truly post-apocalyptic film. I watched the first 3 films like over 10 years ago when I was in my pre-teen years, and at first I obviously thought RW was post-apocalyptic, since after that I became a huge fan of the genre and the influence it had on pretty much everything in that genre was clearly evident. 

But being a huge fan of the franchise and re-watching the films pretty much every year since then, I got the impression that Road Warrior was not really post-apocalyptic as people say it is, rather it is the dystopia seen in first film degraded further on all the levels. Nuclear war happened between RW and Beyond Thunderdome, that's obviously the most logical and ""cliché"" argument to why it's not really post-apocalyptic, there's no apocalypse to speak of yet. The way I see it, RW is just set in that specific ""biome"", an area which is much more uninhabited, obviously a lot more desert, where a group of refugees from the cities is getting attacked by a road gang, which have gotten a lot worse in between the original and the sequel. It might be a stretch, but there could still be rural areas as seen in the original where there's still some local law, but I doubt it. The cities are engulfed in riots, there might be martial law, obviously a dystopian atmosphere but there's still a government, however weak it might be. 

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts about this.",26,1585589500,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frv5nb/do_you_consider_road_warrior_to_be_a_dystopian_or/,movies,1

fruz6s,buckzer0,Top 100 Sports Movies pt 2,"51. Rounders (1998)
Average rating: 80.10

I have “Rounders” writers Brian Koppelman and David Levien to thank for my favorite memories at Michigan State. After this movie came out, we started a Wednesday night poker game that quickly became required every week. We’d get a few $5 pizzas from the student union, pick up a 30-pack of Old Milwaukee’s Best Light for $9.99 (!) from Big Ten Party Store and play hold-em until we were broke (well, at least some of us were). The conversation was just a series of “Rounders” quotes in horrible Teddy KGB impressions. I’m paying you with your own money. Check, check, check. Pay that man his money.

I lost enough in that weekly game that walking back into apartment 110 in Waters Edge would be like Buckner walking back into Shea, but I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

52. The Longest Yard (1974)
Average rating: 80.06

Like many sports movies from the ’70, “The Longest Yard” has many scenes that haven’t aged well. Director Robert Aldrich, who made some of the most testosterone-fueled movies in history, such as “Kiss Me Deadly” and “The Dirty Dozen,” doesn’t skimp on it here either as underdog cons led by Burt Reynolds go up against a well-oiled, semi-pro team made up of prison guards. The football scenes work as real NFLers Joe Kapp and Ray Nitschke give the action some semblance of authenticity. It doesn’t hurt that Reynolds, who played football at Florida State, aces the part of the disgraced, game-throwing QB Paul Crewe.

53. Eight Men Out (1988)
Average rating: 79.75

This movie is historically inaccurate but highly entertaining. It has some of the best baseball action seen on the big screen. The costumes are fantastic. The cast is impressive, and having a young John Cusack play the homely Buck Weaver is a major aesthetic improvement for the character.

54. Kingpin (1996)
Average rating: 79.38

Gross-out comedy of the highest order. Scenes like Roy Munson’s cow-milking mishap, Ishmael’s introduction to dental floss and Roy’s landlord’s post-coital bliss could make “Pink Flamingos”-era John Waters blush. Plus, Bill Murray dripping sleaze and self-satisfaction as Big Ern McCracken both steals the show and somehow anticipates professional bowling’s recent turn toward kitsch and showmanship. If you’re not up on “Kingpin,” you’ve Munsoned your life.

55. Happy Gilmore (1996)
Average rating: 79.33

Who among us hasn’t tried hitting a golf ball after a running start? Adam Sandler defined the ’90s with his slew of juvenile comedies and “Happy Gilmore” is at the top of the list. The one-liners are too many to count and he got beat up by Bob Barker. ‘Nuff said.

58. Cinderella Man (2005)
Average rating: 79.02

Average rating: 78.46

This movie was the entry point for my journey as a Formula 1 fan. It chronicles the rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the early-to-mid 1970s. Daniel Bruhl’s portrayal of Lauda is incredible, Chris Hemsworth’s Hunt is the best performance of his career and Hans Zimmer’s score is epic at the right times. Watch this, follow it up with Netflix’s “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” documentary series, and you’ll be waking up early on Sunday mornings to see if young guns Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc can dethrone Lewis Hamilton as world champion when the 2020 season starts.

62. Rocky III (1982)
Average rating: 78.36

I have no quarrel with those who prefer the superior filmcraft of earlier “Rocky” films. But for me, the franchise isn’t about quality. It’s about indulgence, and “Rocky III” is where the series finds its voice: juiced to the gills and cheesier-than-Kraft-Singles. It’s not the acting or mise-en-scène that endures, but the Hulk Hogan and Mr. T cameos and Rocky and Apollo bro-hugging on the beach.

63. Prefontaine (1997)
Average rating: 78.32

The movie itself is … OK. What makes it work is the lore of a character like Steve Prefontaine. As years go by, he turns more and more into a fable. Paul Bunyan running the 5,000. The film is bolstered by nimbly weaving in archive footage, but is anchored by R. Lee Ermey’s portrayal of legendary Oregon coach Bill Bowerman.

I officially learned I was a sportswriter in the ninth grade in my one year as a high school wrestler. “Vision Quest,” as you would imagine, was required viewing for all high school wrestlers. And, while you don’t have to watch it 50 times like I did, you ought to watch it once. It’s got a little bit of everything, and we’ve all got a Shute in our lives somewhere.

65. Rocky IV (1985)
Average rating: 78.01

Nov. 27, 1985, five days after my 10th birthday, my dad and I went to Tower Mall in Portsmouth, Va., and saw “Rocky IV” on opening night. The place was packed, because as all good Americans in 1985, we were rooting for Rocky to beat the crap out of the Russian. If you haven’t seen this movie — first of all, you’re a communist sympathizer — then consider this a spoiler warning: early in the movie, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is beating up Apollo Creed (Sir Carl Weathers) and there’s a flash to Rocky, who is holding the towel, in-between rounds. Apollo tells him not to stop the fight, but still, Rocky can see where this is going. Drago throws a vicious punch and connects. You see it connect, then you see the towel drop. Black. I’m 10, I know what happened. A hush in the theater, everyone knows exactly what happened — except one woman. The next thing you see is a setting at a funeral. That one woman in the theater screams “Oh my God! He’s dead!” The theater erupts in laughter. To this day, I still laugh at that part. (Sorry, Sir Weathers.) The rest of the movie has become a Cold War cliché, complete with James Brown singing, Rocky losing and then winning and delivering the cornball speech at the end, “… if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change!” It’s so corny, but such a highlight of mid-’80s Cold War culture. And it’s also why we won — U-S-A!

66. Chariots of Fire (1981)
Average rating: 77.81

Two sprinters, each running for a cause greater than their own. The 1981 Oscar winner for Best Picture is a brilliant examination of the journeys of Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell, both of whom won gold and glory for the British Olympic team (Liddell was a Scot) at the 1924 Olympics in Paris.

67. Big Fan (2009)
Average rating: 77.67

Patton Oswalt is brilliant in this dark comedy about an obsessive New York Giants fan. The parking attendant and frequent sports-radio caller doesn’t care that the rest of the world probably views him as a loser. He sees his fanaticism and devotion as a source of purpose and dignity in an oddly engrossing little tale.

68. Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001)
Average rating: 77.62

“Dogtown and Z-Boys” lives in the magical moment when talented, troubled kids from a down-and-out neighborhood — in this case, the Dogtown area of Venice, Calif. — discover and embrace reasons to be passionate about something. This Stacy Peralta-directed documentary is more than the story about skateboarding’s emergence in America.
– Josh Gross, MMA senior writer

69. Creed II (2018)
Average rating: 77.38

Sports movies are all about the goosebump moments. The pimples on the back of my neck have never been raised higher than when Rocky walks into his restaurant and sees Drago seated at a table near the wall. For a kid raised on the “Rocky” movies, the nostalgia packed more punch than a Balboa left cross. Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson shine, but seeing Rocky and Drago exchange icy glares for the first time since Balboa singlehandedly ended the Cold War in “Rocky IV” was even more than I could have hoped for going in.
– Krawczynski

70. Seabiscuit (2003)
Average rating: 77.35

I gave “Seabiscuit” a high-ish score of 89 – in part because it scored a Best Picture nomination but also in part because of the tremendous performances from Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper. While I didn’t think the film was as good as the book by Laura Hillenbrand, it still captured my imagination and transported me to a time when horse racing was one of the biggest sports in the United States.

Average rating: 77.31

I actually saw “Dodgeball” in the theater twice, it was that funny. Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller are the headliners, but the most memorable performances came from a couple of smaller roles — Jason Bateman as a dodgeball color analyst (“Bold move, Cotton”) and Lance Armstrong as, well, himself (pre-doping scandal).
– Mandel

72. Invictus (2009)
Average rating: 77.24

It’s a rebuttal to the “Stick to sports!” goons. “Invictus” shows how sports and politics are often intertwined and that grace and forgiveness are way better than payback. It’s a typical underdog-wins-the-title story, but this squad, South Africa’s rugby team, pulls a nation together along the way. Oh, and Morgan Freeman is Nelson Mandela.
– Matt Barrows, 49ers beat writer

73. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)
Average rating: 76.41

It mocked NASCAR culture at its peak, but it did so with such affection that it’s loved by racing fans and haters alike. Did Will Ferrell and Adam McKay make better movies? Sure. But it’s a shame this doesn’t top our list because if you ain’t first, well …
– Michael Sanserino, Pittsburgh managing editor

74. Bend It Like Beckham (2002)
Average rating: 76.36

It came at a perfect time, post-1999 World Cup, to throw fuel on the fires of total soccer obsession. Add in Jess’ journey to find her own identity and the extreme subtextual queerness between her and Jules, and you get a perfect, formative movie for a generation.
– Meg Linehan, USWNT and NWSL staff writer

75. The Endless Summer (1966)
Average rating: 75.91

More of a travelogue/buddy flick than an actual sports film, but “The Endless Summer” beautifully explains surf culture to a generation of people who were only familiar with it through Frankie &amp; Annette movies, or the dulcet sounds of Jan &amp; Dean and The Beach Boys.
– Eric Duhatschek, senior NHL columnist

76. Rudy (1993)
Average rating: 75.83

Some people think “Rudy” is too corny; I think it’s near-perfection. The story of a scrawny walk-on who finally gets his shot would not have resonated like it did if it involved any school other than Notre Dame, which is built on heroes and mythology. The final act is as powerful and emotional as sports dramas get.
– Mandel

77. McFarland, USA (2015)
Average rating: 75.23

This is a Disney film, but director Niki Caro rarely lets this based-on-a-true-story movie dip too far into schmaltz. Sports-movie-Hall of Famer Kevin Costner builds a high school cross country team made of poor kids of migrant farm-working families. But because of the work the runners put in — at school and in the fields — the team’s success at the end feels earned instead of something preordained by Hollywood. Two scenes stand out: one where Costner works the fields to get an idea of why some of the kids miss practice and he barely makes it through the day without collapsing; and the other being the team’s trip to see the ocean for the first time, which is — (sorry, is it getting a little dusty in here?).
– Peterson

78. Pumping Iron (1977)
Average rating: 75.12

The world of competitive bodybuilding was all but in the dark until the 1977 documentary “Pumping Iron” shed light on this strangely fascinating sport. The fly-on-the-wall style truly gives us a feeling of seeing something rarely seen by the public. Centering on the 1975 IFBB Mr. Universe and 1975 Mr. Olympia competitions and the competitive rivalry between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, the personalities of these larger-than-life athletes really shine through. In fact, it made both men household names, with Schwarzenegger essentially becoming the biggest action movie star of all time (and eventually the governor of California) following its release.
– Garrison

79. Race (2016)
Average rating: 75.0

Perhaps it’s the “Chariots of Fire” influence, but I’m a pushover for any movie about running. The attention to detail in this 2016 biopic about Jesse Owens was meticulous, most notably the high drama at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Jason Sudeikis plays Larry Snyder, Owens’ college coach. One caveat: I kept envisioning Sudeikis in his role as Joe Biden on “Saturday Night Live” when re-watching scenes from this movie.
– Lisa Dillman, Los Angeles senior writer

80. Love &amp; Basketball (2000)
Average rating: 74.79

It’s part family drama, part love story and partially an allegory on the destructive side of competition. Both Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan are excellent, playing lifelong friends whose devotion to hoops clouds their emotional judgment. It’s a cleverly written movie with very few clichés and because of that easily floats above the restrictions of any one genre. There’s a reason why it’s cited so often by hoops lovers and, two decades after its release, still holds up really well.
– Salaam

81. The Rookie (2002)
Average rating: 74.74

One of my high school teammates frequently parroted a line from this movie: “You know what we get to do today, Brooks? We get to play baseball.” That’s the crux of “The Rookie”: love for a beautiful game. The film touches on themes of resilience, family and hope, and the story of a high school teacher-turned big leaguer feels even more remarkable because it’s based on true events.
– Peter Baugh, Missouri football writer

82. Glory Road (2006)
Average rating: 74.61

This movie introduced the world to what El Paso already knew — that Don Haskins was a legend. Sure, it’s a feel-good sports tale, but it captured the challenges of race, culture and college sports to tell the story that could have only originated in this unique border city.
– Greer

83. A River Runs Through It (1992)
Average rating: 74.54

A 20-something Brad Pitt’s charisma carries the film, but Norman Maclean’s words are its engine. Robert Redford narrates directly from the essential Montana novella, as the sweeping drama tells a story of brotherhood, faith, class and race through a lens of shadow casts over the Big Blackfoot. In this classic, all things merge beautifully into one.
– Bill Oram, Lakers beat writer

84. Cool Runnings (1993)
Average rating: 74.49

“Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme” — well, I always did. “Cool Runnings” may be corny and not entirely historically accurate … but it is feel-good. Add some of the catchy lines, a splash of John Candy, and it’s exactly what you’d want from any sports comedy.
– Brendan Marks, Duke/UNC beat writer

85. We Are Marshall (2006)
Average rating: 74.46

I vividly remember seeing We Are Marshall in a theater with members of my high school football team. I had vague ideas of the details of the actual story, but I am man enough to admit that I got very emotional in that theater. Matthew McConaughey delivers a stirring and inspiring performance as Jack Lengyel, and the sensitivity and respect in the way director McG approached the material deserves to be recognized. A film like this can easily feel like capitalizing off an emotional response, but I felt that it honored the real victims of the tragedy wonderfully. I also remember feeling very thankful for my teammates as we left the theater that day.
– Garrison

86. Tin Cup (1996)
Average rating: 74.39

We humans are fallible. Most aren’t down with those flaws publicly exposed. Kevin Costner’s weathered, underdog golf pro character Roy McAvoy constantly loses battles with pride — and water on the 72nd hole of the U.S. Open — on and off the course. The go-for-it charm while chasing greatness makes ol’ Roy a folk hero. “When a defining moment comes along, you define the moment or the moment defines you.”
– Ben Standig, D.C. staff writer

87. Blue Chips (1994)
Average rating: 74.06

Pete Bell might be a good coach, but he is the worst recruiter in America and deserved to be fired. In the beginning of the movie, he tries to pin Western University’s lack of talent on his staff, but how about that Bell needed Robert Wuhl’s pseudo-Nike huckster character to tell him to recruit Butch McRae (Penny Hardaway), despite the fact that Butch plays for the same Chicago high school as Bell’s best player, Tony, and Bell was best friends with his principal, Lou Gossett Jr. playing a Catholic priest.

A more subtle inconsistency I love is when the underground street agent Slick tells Bell about a player no one has ever heard of in Neon Boudeaux, a.k.a. Shaquille O’Neal. Slick then reveals Neon briefly played in junior college and just destroyed a bunch of NBA players in an open gym. And, you know, he looks like Shaq. But no one’s ever heard of him! (Don’t get my colleague Larry Holder started on the ridiculous Algiers, La., scene.)

One detail I shake my head at in my old age is that sportswriter Ed O’Neill blows his own scoop in the denouement press conference. All this said, I love “Blue Chips.” Love it. The basketball scenes are legit, complete with celebrity cameos that are a blast to see now. Hey, that’s Rex Walters! Nick Nolte is fantastic as the Bobby Knight knockoff coach who beats the real thing. While Bell’s morality is the soul of the movie, Happy the booster, Lavada McRae and Ricky Roe (and his dad) make valid points about the inanity of amateurism in college hoops.

Also, TV is a tough class. It’s not just watching the tube.
– Greenberg

88. Wildcats (1986)
Average rating: 73.75

The second-best sports movie co-starring Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes. It’s a classic sports movie setup, an unlikely coach makes unlikely winners out of misfit athletes as they beat some rich jerks. Is it fine cinema? No. Does it traffic in the kind of troublesome tropes (white savior complex) familiar in pretty much every 1980s movie? Yes.

But as a movie you catch on TBS, it works. And as a kid, I loved it. The closing song is goofy and fantastic. “It’s the sport of kings, better than diamond rings, football. Football.” And don’t forget the Central High cheerleaders’ go-to chant, “U-G-L-Y, you ain’t got no alibi, you ugly.”
– Greenberg

89. Space Jam (1996)
Average rating: 73.55

Parenthood has given me a new appreciation of this movie. Because of it, my 6-year-old son knows all about Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson and … uh … Shawn Bradley? Part of the plot — NBA players lose their abilities to a mysterious force, forcing the cancellation of the season — is a little too on the nose right now.
– Chris Burke, Detroit Lions beat writer

90. Heaven Can Wait (1978)
Average rating: 73.39

As a 7-year-old completely obsessed with the Rams uniforms, I begged my dad to take me to this movie, which he did when it finally came to the single-screen theater located on Main Street in my hometown. The comedic precision of Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin escaped my younger self — I only cared about seeing more climactic game action when Warren Beatty body-hopped his way into the Super Bowl. Kudos to Beatty for not embarrassing himself while throwing those crossing routes, and for taking repeated flattenings from Deacon Jones when a stunt double could’ve sufficed. (Write a song about that, Carly Simon.) Nine Oscar nominations and a plot that blossomed into reality a year late when the Rams actually faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XIV. (Come to think if it, have we ever seen Beatty and Vince Ferragamo in the same room?)
– G. Allan Taylor, West Virginia and Big 12 staff writer

91 (tied). Paper Lion (1968)
Average rating: 73.31

“Paper Lion” has designs to make sportswriter George Plimpton (played by Alan Alda) a sympathetic figure in the rough-and-tumble NFL. It fails in that regard, and Plimpton generally seems unlikable. But Detroit Lions defensive tackle Alex Karras turns the movie into a winner with his outsized personality and everyman approach.
– Dochterman

91 (tied). Youngblood (1986)
Average rating: 73.31

Pretty-boy hockey player Rob Lowe gets roughed up, quits, learns how to fight in the family barn, then returns to kick Racki’s ass in the big game. (Serves him right, that cheap-shot bastard). If you like ’80s movies, this hits all the tropes: Patrick Swayze, Keanu Reeves and a training montage set to music.
– Barrows

93. Secretariat (2010)
Average rating: 73.11

Even though I knew Big Red would win by 31 lengths, seeing his Belmont Stakes record run recreated was thrilling in this movie. Secretariat, the horse, was greatness in living color, and “Secretariat,” the movie, is focused on showing greatness. No underdog story here. Just Diane Lane and Secretariat dominating.
– Lee

94. Mystery, Alaska (1999)
Average rating: 73.05

The plot is a little thin — a group of Saturday afternoon amateurs try to stay competitive with the 1999 New York Rangers in an outdoor exhibition game — but the scenery is breathtaking and the movie will resonate with anyone that ever played shinny as a kid on a shivery winter day and dreamed of playing in the NHL. Burt Reynolds has a great turn as an overbearing hockey dad who has a come-to-Jesus moment; and Russell Crowe wearing a Gretzky-era Jofa helmet is a pitch-perfect finishing touch.
– Duhatschek

95. Bloodsport (1988)
Average rating: 72.91

How legendary is “Bloodsport?” Perhaps this will help explain: I’m not fluent in Spanish. Never have been. But have I watched the entirety of a Spanish-language version of “Bloodsport” without subtitles before? Absolutely, I have. Because Frank Dux’s pursuit of Kumite glory transcends language. It’s the ultimate Van Damme flick, sucking you in and refusing to let go until the reign of that cheat Chong Li is over for good.
– Al-Shatti

96. Beyond the Mat (1999)
Average rating: 72.86

This documentary bares the human toll on pro wrestlers. Even two decades later, the behind-the-scenes footage is equally heartbreaking and inspiring. You might not really understand what it is these performers do, but after watching this you’ll appreciate why they do it.
– Rossi

97. Above the Rim (1994)
Average rating: 72.64

How is ATR widely beloved? Let me count the ways: The soundtrack. The screen-bursting magnetism and menace of Tupac Shakur as Birdie. Tommy Sheppard walking onto the court at halftime and shooting 30-for-30 in his corduroy pants in the Shootout tournament final. But in New York, “Above the Rim” is bigger than that. I was a month shy of turning 12 when the film came out, playing for a recreation center travel team with future all-city high school teammates. My job was to rebound and set screens for Smush Parker. We played on the same courts and in the same gyms where “Above the Rim” was shot. We wore the same shorts from Olaf’s, the Harlem hoops institution. We saw our basketball lives onscreen, set to music by Tha Dogg Pound and 2Pac. I don’t know if I ever felt greater. The elastic wore out on all of my Olaf’s years ago, but I still have every pair folded in the bottom drawer of my childhood bedroom.
– Bartholomew

98. Varsity Blues (1999)
Average rating: 72.18

This isn’t a great movie. I’m not even sure it’s a good one. But it was never intended to be. This is a fun movie filled with memorable characters and, if you were in high school in the late ’90s, you’ll feel right at home. And remember, never say no when Darcy Sears asks if you’ll take whipped cream with that ice cream.
– Yohe

99. Ali (2001)
Average rating: 72.17

I think it goes without saying that we all like Will Smith. He’s one of the most charismatic and entertaining personalities of the past 30 years. But not many people give him credit for being a legitimately great actor. “Ali” changed that perception quickly as he embodied every nuance of the legendary boxer, from his mannerisms to his signature speaking cadence. Smith ended up losing the Best Actor award to Denzel Washington’s iconic performance in “Training Day,” and Muhammad Ali probably deserves a better movie than “Ali” to do his career justice, but I’d definitely be willing to cast Will Smith in the role again.
– Garrison

100. The Pride of the Yankees (1942)
Average rating: 72.14

The ultimate old-Hollywood sports biography. “The Pride of the Yankees” is as much a love story between Gary Cooper’s Gehrig and Teresa Wright’s Eleanor as it is a sports movie. And that’s OK, because the chemistry between Cooper and Wright is more than enough to make up for the less-than-authentic sports scenes. (Watch Lou’s first homer as a kid to see where the ball comes from.) “Knute Rockne All-American” may have the “win-one-for-the-Gipper” speech, but nothing tops Cooper’s delivery of Lou Gehrig’s “Luckiest Man” speech (which screenwriters Jo Swerling and Herman Mankiewicz re-ordered). Yet, for me, one of the movie’s most poignant moments comes after the speech, as Cooper walks off the field, up the tunnel, the No. 4 on his back as the umpire yells, “Play ball!” Gehrig may be gone, but life, and the game, goes on.

fruywn,buckzer0,The top 100 Sports Movies. Pt 1,"When you grow up a sports fan, transferring that fandom from the backyard Wiffle ball game to the big screen at the local theater is a natural transition. We fall in love with movies that reflect our life experiences. We see our best friends in “The Sandlot.” Or quote “Happy Gilmore” relentlessly in the dorms. It’s why one person can find a movie like “Field of Dreams” completely hokey while another turns to mush the moment Ray Kinsella’s dad pulls off his catcher’s mask and places it over his heart. We know what’s coming next.

It means our opinions of these movies vary wildly. Especially when you work at a media company with 400-plus employees who are all sports diehards. And opinionated. So in trying to determine the Top 100 Sports movies of all time, we decided to make the process as democratic as possible. That meant a lot of rules, processes and restrictions.

First, we asked everyone on staff to nominate their favorite sports movies. This list quickly got unwieldy. Within days, it was 300 movies deep. It included movies people desperately wanted on the ballot where the only sport was, say, guys in jeans playing beach volleyball. Even with extra time on our hands, we didn’t want people rating 500 movies. So we made some rules.

To be considered, a movie had to be released in theaters at some point. That removed some really good television-only sports movies. (We’re looking at you “Brian’s Song” and “61*”.)  For documentaries to make the final ballot, the doc had to be released in theaters (no TV docs) and be at least nominated for an Oscar; or added to the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry; or make at least $1M at the box office; or be culturally significant. Finally, with a small panel of movie enthusiasts, we culled the list to make individual calls on borderline sports movies. Is “The Big Lebowski” really a sports movie? When things got tough, they went bowling. So we think it is. But there’s a good debate to be had about many others.

Next, we asked everyone to rate as many movies as they’ve seen on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being best. You could give Rocky a 100 as well as Space Jam, if you so pleased. And why wouldn’t you?

In all, more than 120 panelists from The Athletic voted. The ratings were averaged out and sorted into the Top 100 below. To qualify for the final list, a movie needed at least 10 ratings from panelists.

We hope it gives some entertainment inspiration for any extra spare time you might have. And it’s just the start. All week, we’re rolling out sports movie-themed stories. From a technical breakdown of Adam Sandler’s tackling skills in “The Waterboy” to an oral history of the best dog basketball movie ever made. It’s going to be fun. We hope you enjoy.

Grab your popcorn. Here goes.

1. Rocky (1976)
Average rating: 91.04

The cartoonish fight scenes don’t come close to resembling an actual boxing match, but the movie did wonderfully capture the essence of the characters and promotional hype that make boxing so unique. In many ways, “Rocky” laid out the formula for underdog sports movies, grabbing an Oscar for Best Picture.
– Mike Coppinger, boxing insider

2. Raging Bull (1980)
Average rating: 90.52

People thought it was crazy to do a boxing movie after another one won the Oscar for Best Picture four years earlier, as if there was nothing new to bring to the table. But “Raging Bull” is a rare instance of a director (Martin Scorsese), cinematographer (Michael Chapman) and actors (Robert de Niro, Joe Pesci) all at the absolute peak of their careers. It’s one of the films I revisit most often, and I am blown away by something new with each viewing. The choice to make the film in black-and-white is the definitive stroke of genius by Scorsese. It emphasizes the grit and beauty of the sport more than ever before, and “Raging Bull” holds up as a true masterpiece 40 years later.
– Kent Garrison, NFL Audio, Mad About Movies Podcast

3. Hoop Dreams (1994)
Average rating: 89.83

“Hoop Dreams” is the best sports movie ever, and ranks among the great documentaries of any genre. Following two basketball prodigies through high school is just the tip of the iceberg; the real genius is how it brilliantly chronicles issues of race, class and education in a poor Chicago neighborhood.
– John Hollinger, senior NBA columnist

4. Bull Durham (1988)
Average rating: 89.53

“Bull Durham” is among the most quotable films ever written. Just this from Annie Savoy, played by Susan Sarandon, should make you want to fire it up right now: “I believe in the church of baseball. I’ve tried all the major religions, and most of the minor ones. I’ve worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, trees, mushrooms and Isadora Duncan. I know things. For instance, there are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary and there are 108 stitches in a baseball. When I heard that, I gave Jesus a chance. But it just didn’t work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me.”
– Arpon Basu, Montreal editor-in-chief

5. Miracle (2004)
Average rating: 89.48

If sports movies have a weakness, it’s that they typically tell an unimaginable story. The story of the 1980 United States men’s hockey team was unimaginable. It also actually happened. Kurt Russell is brilliant as Herb Brooks and the movie does a really good job of accurately telling one of the greatest stories in sports history. One of Brooks’ final acts before his 2003 death was helping with this project. His fingerprints add to the credibility.
– Josh Yohe, Penguins beat writer

6. The Big Lebowski (1998)
Average rating: 89.45

The Coen Brothers were coming off “Fargo,” their visceral and darkly comedic breakout that became a true Oscar contender. So, of course, their next film was about three guys in 1992 Los Angeles who live to bowl. Nobody really got it at the time, including me. But The Dude, Walter and Donnie have aged like fine wine, delivering some of the most quotable lines in a comedy in the past 25 years. And if people deny it’s a “sports movie,” just remember the scene where The Dude and Walter botch the ransom money handoff and all Walter can think to say is … “Fuck it, Dude, let’s go bowling.”
– Garrison

7. Breaking Away (1979)
Average rating: 89.32

Writer Steve Tesich’s 1979 love-letter to Bloomington, Ind., and the Little 500 race is one of the great coming-of-age movies of its era. Gorgeously filmed with terrific performances, it’s impossible to watch the film and not want to pick up a bicycle.
– Richard Deitsch, senior writer

8. (tied) O.J.: Made in America (2016)
Average rating: 89.28

Let’s face it: The O.J. Simpson trial is the definitive sports story of our generation. And it deserved to be told in a documentary that was as detailed and well-researched as “O.J.: Made in America.” The grisly details of the double-murder in Brentwood had never been shown to the American public like this before, and I was shocked at some of the reveals in the film, from the crime scene photographs to the racist rant caught on tape. The entire production was nothing short of mesmerizing. With a total runtime of 7 hours, 47 minutes, it’s the longest film to ever win an Oscar (it took home Best Documentary Feature for 2016). But honestly, I wish it was 77 hours or more.
– Garrison

8. (tied) When We Were Kings (1996)
Average rating: 89.28

Arguably the greatest sports documentary of all time, the footage and access is captivating as the film takes you behind the scenes of Muhammad Ali’s journey to become two-time heavyweight champion vs. George Foreman and the following he cultivated in Zaire along the way, showing the kind of icon “The Greatest” was.
– Coppinger

10. Major League (1989)
Average rating: 89.24

My favorite baseball movie of all-time, “Major League” is a perfect blend of comedy and sports action, with a fantastic Randy Newman song “Burn On” leading off. You gotta have a great score to be a great sports movie, this one was done by James Newton Howard. Jake Taylor’s stalking scenes haven’t aged well, but otherwise, it still plays. Teams are put together to lose all the time now, and Rachel Phelps might as well be Jeffrey Loria.

Five hundred viewings later, I still get goosebumps watching the one-game playoff with the Yankees and hey, that’s where I first learned about Babe Ruth’s called shot. A key to this movie’s success is the actors actually seem like ballplayers and coaches. The next time you watch, notice how they don’t cut away from Charlie Sheen when he pitches. The dialogue is top-notch, never corny and it has the most repeatable lines of any sports movie. Try watching any old baseball game and not saying, “Just a bit outside. Tried the corner and missed,” in your Bob Uecker voice. Lines like, “We got uniforms and everything, it’s pretty great.” “This guy here is dead.” “Cross him off then.” “I say fuck you Jobu, I do this myself,” are etched into my brain forever.

Let us never mention the sequels.

11. The Sandlot (1993)
Average rating: 88.33

This is one of the few movies that legitimately takes me back to when baseball was more important to my group of friends than God and family. I can really relate to meeting the new kid, Smalls, and the mischief of trying to recover the ball from Beast. I felt like I was living out this plot.
– Jeremy Rutherford, Blues beat writer

12. Free Solo (2018)
Average rating: 88.19

I can’t say I’m a huge rock climbing fan. Or a fan of anything that reminds me that I need to get outside more. But we watched “Free Solo” with the family before a summer trip to Yosemite and were blown away. It’s an account of Alex Honnold’s attempt to become the first to free solo climb El Capitan and it’s both parts terrifying and inspirational. This movie stays with you. Just a few weeks after viewing, we found ourselves at the base of El Capitan staring directly up at its 3,000-foot face and realizing just how incredible this human achievement by Honnold truly was.
– Craig Custance, NHL-U.S. editor-in-chief

13. Caddyshack (1980)
Average rating: 87.94

You don’t even have to love golf to appreciate this country-club satire. It’s also ageless. So many of the film’s best lines are still instantly identifiable 40 years later — most of them from Bill Murray’s inspired performance as greenskeeper Carl Spackler (“It’s in the hole!”) and chronic scene-stealer Rodney Dangerfield.
– Stewart Mandel, college football editor-in-chief

14. The Hustler (1961)
Average rating: 87.56

I’m stunned you can’t find this movie on more great sports movies list. (Believe me, I’ve checked.) Maybe people don’t consider pool a sport. Maybe it’s because people don’t like a story where even the winners act like losers. Or maybe people have just forgotten it? But how can you not remember a film with so many memorable performances? As “Fast” Eddie Felson, Paul Newman becomes Paul Newman™, Jackie Gleason shatters his “The Honeymooners” persona, Piper Laurie is heartbreaking and the way George C. Scott yells, “You owe me MONEY!” has been burned into my brain since I first saw this film. It’s an American tragedy where love is lost, trust is broken and even the best hustler gets hustled. And it all starts with the first thrust of a pool cue.
– Rob Peterson, NBA editor

15. Hoosiers (1986)
Average rating: 87.35

Coach Norman Dale (Gene Hackman) measuring the height of the basket at Butler Fieldhouse to repeat the importance of fundamentals he stressed to his undermanned 1950s high school team throughout a season packed with inspiring speeches and teamwork makes this go-to viewing for anyone before (or after) their 18th birthday.
– Lance Pugmire, boxing senior writer

16. Slap Shot (1977)
Average rating: 87.34

A true oldie but goodie, “Slap Shot” is a cult classic from the opening interview with the French-Canadian goalie to Paul Newman’s classic “They brought their fucking toys with them” lament. No movie has ever featured three nerd-glasses-wearing brothers as violent as the Hanson Brothers; that trio alone merits this score.
– Hollinger

17. Senna (2010)
Average rating: 87.18

I’ve never once watched a single Formula 1 race. I couldn’t tell you the first thing about the sport, and I certainly hadn’t heard of Ayrton Senna before. But Asif Kapadia’s 2010 documentary on the Brazilian icon is both haunting and brilliant, a story of triumph and heartbreak so masterfully woven together that it even made the cynical 20-something version of me bawl my eyes out.
– Shaheen Al-Shatti, senior MMA writer

18. Icarus (2017)
Average rating: 86.90

Bryan Fogel’s thrilling 2017 Oscar-winning documentary is a larger story within a smaller one. Upon the director exploring the impact of performance-enhancing drugs to prepare for an amateur cycling race, his advisor, Moscow anti-doping lab head Grigory Rodchenkov, provides the evidence for the state-sponsored scheme Russia undertook for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. A mesmerizing watch.
– Deitsch

19. The Bad News Bears (1976)
Average rating: 86.70

The original “The Bad News Bears” is the best baseball movie ever made. And more. It’s an often-hilarious yet unflinching look at hyper-competitive parents, a movie that also touches on other cultural issues from feminism to immigration. Great script for a perfect ensemble cast led by Walter Matthau at his hangdog best as chain-smoking alcoholic Morris Buttermaker, ex-minor league pitcher hired to coach misfit 12-year-olds unwanted by other teams in their suburban Los Angeles Little League. He keeps a cooler of booze in the dugout and mixes bourbon in his beer before batting practice. Thankfully, it was made in 1976, because it wouldn’t get made today. After his team gets trounced, Buttermaker brings in two ringers, curveball-tossing Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O’Neal) and motorcycle-riding, cig-smoking rebel Kelly Leak (Jackie Earle Haley), not just the toughest kid in the ‘hood but the best athlete. The Bears evolve into a scrappy bunch that gives the Yankees all they can handle in the league championship game. The movie has all the feels but none of the schmaltz or artificial emotionalism of typical baseball movies.

20. A League of Their Own (1992)
Average rating: 86.67

One life experience I can recommend is dressing up as Jimmy Dugan for a friend’s Halloween party and overcommitting to the bit, flask-wise. The reservoir of quotable lines is bottomless in any state of mind and your friends will forever get to speculate about which one of you will be “Dugan” the next time you’re all together. Avoid the clap.
– Bo Wulf, Philadelphia Eagles beat writer

21. Field of Dreams (1989)
Average rating: 86.35

No quote turns stoic sports fans into mushy messes quite like the ending of “Field of Dreams.” From the moment Ray Kinsella offers, “Dad … you wanna have a catch?”, the movie flips from kitschy and interesting to iconic and heavenly. It’s an inspiring movie where dreams truly come true.
– Scott Dochterman, Iowa football writer

22. Sugar (2008)
Average rating: 86.29

If escapism is your number one goal when it comes to watching a sports movie, you may not love “Sugar.” But education is another form of entertainment, and this movie by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (from “Half Nelson” and “Captain Marvel”) is a beautifully done — realistic — view of what it’s like for a young Dominican player to come to this country and try to navigate his way through the minor leagues to the show.
– Eno Sarris, baseball analytics writer

23. White Men Can’t Jump (1992)
Average rating: 85.41

The biggest — and potentially fatal — flaw of the movie is that Wesley Snipes, who’s supposed to be a star, isn’t actually all that good at basketball. It’s noticeable, especially opposite Woody Harrelson, who clearly has some game. What not only saves the movie, but makes it a success, and legitimate classic, is the charisma of Snipes as “Sidney” and Harrelson as “Billy Hoyle.” Their chemistry is first-rate. The basketball itself matters less.
– Jonas Siegel, Maple Leafs reporter

24. The Wrestler (2008)
Average rating: 85.23

So on-point about the real world of so-called “fake” wrestling, this movie unnerved those in the industry. Mickey Rourke’s lead performance leaves you thinking of almost any pro wrestler from the 1980s and wondering what happened to that guy. You can’t turn this movie off — even when you want to look away.
– Rob Rossi, Pittsburgh Penguins writer

25. Moneyball (2011)
Average rating: 84.68

The genius of “Moneyball” is the way it merges its highly technical subject matter (front-office maneuvering, baseball analytics) with the most basic storytelling tropes. The brains were baked in; the heart and the entertainment value comes from the structure and execution. On one level it’s a classic underdog story, with Brad Pitt’s lone visionary bucking against conventional wisdom in a deeply unfair system. At another, it’s a buddy movie, with Jonah Hill’s fish-out-of-water contrasting brilliantly with Pitt’s almost casual arrogance.

It’s a numbers story, and I admit that I was predisposed to like it for that reason alone. I love it because it’s all so well done, and I’m more than happy to trade some narrative smoothing for the beautiful simplicity of “Adapt or die.”
– Jonathan Willis, Edmonton staff writer

26. Remember the Titans (2000)
Average rating: 84.48

First, it has the best actor of all time, Denzel Washington, playing the lead — and playing it perfectly. The man not only makes you believe he’s a real football coach, but he has you ready to run through a brick wall for him. But there is significance beyond the theatrics. This film, loosely based on true events, depicts a Virginia high school football team’s fight for inclusion and equality, battles from the early ’70s that so many still are fighting today.
– Darnell Mayberry, Chicago Bulls beat writer

27. Ford v Ferrari (2019)
Average rating: 84.46

Go. See. This. Movie. If you haven’t seen it yet … then it should be the next thing you do after reading this. I gave it a 100. Not only did it score a Best Picture nomination, but the acting, action and storytelling were superb. I got teary-eyed when Ken Miles (played by Christian Bale) was explaining “The Perfect Lap” to his son while they were sitting on the tarmac at LAX, staring at the Southern California sunset.
– Josh Cooper, Los Angeles editor

28. Creed (2015)
Average rating: 84.39

This didn’t just revive the Rocky universe. It’s one of the two best films in the series. Michael B. Jordan’s Adonis Johnson/Creed is an all-time performance in a sports movie. Jordan and Tessa Thompson’s Bianca relationship, and the Philadelphia-specific details, are great. The fight with Leo “The Lion” Sporino, which is one long tracking shot, is perfect. The entrances when Adonis fights “Pretty” Ricky Conlan at Goodison Park (because Sly Stallone is a huge Everton supporter) are perfect. I’m here for at least three more Creed movies, and a spinoff with Viktor Drago from Creed II as well.
– Corey Masisak, New Jersey Devils beat writer

29. Friday Night Lights (2004)
Average rating: 84.24

Between the book and the series, the movie sometimes gets the short end of the stick. That’s unfortunate, because there may not be a purer sports film out there, emotionally speaking. From Billingsley’s battles with his dad to Boobie’s busted knee, the rawness of these high schoolers dealing with unfathomable pressure is something else. How could you not get chills listening to Coach Gaines’ “perfect” speech, or hearing Ivory Christian challenge his teammates? Let’s not forget the music, which has since carved out a niche of its own in sports lore.
– Matt Fortuna, national college football writer

30. (tied) The Karate Kid (1984)
Average rating: 84.06

The best movie ever made (don’t @ me), “The Karate Kid” had it all: the characters (Miyagi, Daniel-san, Johnny, Kreese); the sayings (wax on, wax off, get him a body bag, sweep the leg), the dramatic finish (crane kick) all intertwined with the most underappreciated part of the film – the unique and heartwarming relationship between two very “different but same” individuals who filled a void in each other’s life.
– Mark Kaboly, Steelers beat writer

30. (tied) The Natural (1984)
Average rating: 84.06

I’m one of those annoying “The book was better” nerds and yes, Bernard Malamud’s book is better than the Barry Levinson-Robert Redford movie. (This goes double for “Shoeless Joe” over “Field of Dreams.”) In the book, Roy Hobbs is a darker, more textured character than the quiet, mysterious ballplayer a late 40s Redford plays in the movie. The book’s dark ending wouldn’t make sense on the big screen, so the more cinematic movie ending fits better.

One of the strengths of this movie is the Randy Newman score, complete with the haunting hero’s theme, which is perfectly attuned to the bildungsroman tale. This was released in an era of gauzy sports flicks. In a five-year span between 1984-89, “The Natural,” “Hoosiers” and “Field of Dreams” all came out. Hollywood was banking on sports nostalgia and it paid off. Playing catch with dad, five passes before you shoot. All that crap.

32. Dear Basketball (2017)
Average rating: 84.0

People were shocked when Kobe Bryant walked on stage to accept an Academy Award for Best Animated Short for 2017. He had retired less than a year earlier, and now he’s accepting an Oscar. The beautiful short, animated in pencil and watercolors and flawlessly narrated by Bryant, captured his love for the game he had dedicated his entire life to. I guess no one thought Kobe had that creative spark in him, and it opened an exciting new avenue post-retirement. Following his death in 2020, the film went viral on social media, and I shed a tear watching it again as it took on an even deeper meaning.
– Garrison

33. Rocky II (1979)
Average rating: 83.10

“Rocky II,” the first of the series to be directed by Sylvester Stallone, has some rather profound layers to it. The culture of fame and sudden wealth, how it can chew you up and spit you out in an instant, being one of the more significant ones. Also, Rocky wins in this one.
– Basu

34. The Boxer (1997)
Average rating: 82.33

With the world’s finest actor in the title role, this is the stripped-down story of a fighter returning to his Belfast neighborhood after years in jail. Danny Flynn wants to resume boxing; the IRA has other ideas. Daniel Day-Lewis prepared for two years for the fight scenes. It shows. Bonus — no music video masquerading as a training montage.
– Scott Cruickshank, Flames beat writer

35. Million Dollar Baby (2004)
Average rating: 82.15

Clint Eastwood’s Oscar-winning pearl is my favorite boxing movie. It so perfectly captures the jaded mannerisms of a trainer (Best Director, Eastwood) and the solitary motivations that burnish a champion fighter (Best Actress, Hilary Swank). When her nickname is translated, the audience can’t help but let its guard down too.
– Pugmire

36. The Color of Money (1986)
Average rating: 82.05

There are better billiards movies. There are better ones starring Paul Newman as “Fast” Eddie Felson. But seeing Newman revisit his iconic role from “The Hustler” is damn enjoyable. And his character being fully formed from that movie adds weight to this sort-of-sequel. Plus, there just aren’t that many billiards movies anymore. We need more billiards movies.
– Rossi

37. Win Win (2011)
Average rating: 82.0

First of all, this is a really good movie with some big-time performances by Paul Giamatti, Amy Ryan and Alex Shaffer. But “Win Win” is a winner in my book because it’s set in my hometown of New Providence, N.J. (Go Pioneers!) and was written and directed by one of NP’s finest, Tom McCarthy.
– Mitch Light, Nashville and Memphis managing editor

38. Fighting with My Family (2019)
Average rating: 81.82

Based on a true story about WWE wrestler Paige, the plot has its share of clichés, but a strong supporting cast including Lena Headey, Nick Frost and Vince Vaughn makes it shine. Every character brings something to the table. A fun film about dreams and family.
– Chris Vannini, national college football reporter

39. Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993)
Average rating: 81.65

The film is set in the brutally competitive world of tournament chess and explores the quandary for parents who discover their child is exceptionally talented. How best to maximize the gift? Are you living vicariously through them? If they’re simply not consumed with winning, despite high capabilities, is that wasted potential? Are you, quite frankly, screwing up your kid? Even without the little league, this might be the greatest film ever made about little league parents.
– Andy Kamenetzky, Los Angeles writer and podcast host

40. Bang the Drum Slowly (1973)
Average rating: 81.57

It’s a baseball movie, but it’s not. It’s a sad movie, but it’s not. It’s about relationships — in this case, teammates — and taking the time to see someone others don’t know is there. This is one that makes grown men swallow the lump in the throat. It feels like “Brian’s Song,” but goes its own way.
– Brendan Quinn, college basketball and golf senior writer

41. I, Tonya (2017)
Average rating: 81.47

Honestly, Allison Janney’s tour-de-force performance in this movie as the unyielding, harsh and domineering stage mom to Tonya Harding is alone worth the recognition (it also earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). But the entire cast was superb in its portrayal of one of the most stunning sports scandals in modern history. In trying to reconcile wildly differing versions of the truth, the movie veers between drama and comedy, with a fair bit of camp in between.

I loved this movie because I’ve always found Harding to be one of the most fascinating sports figures of my childhood. Despite being implicated in a horrific attack on her competitor, the plucky firebrand managed to win over legions of fans who admired her verve and moxie. In a sport where elegance, grace and poise are revered, Harding was a true iconoclast — powerful, athletic, brash and unapologetic; she made me a fan of figure skating. Margot Robbie captured the titular character perfectly, and the movie was an excellent reminder of why Harding was both so polarizing and captivating all at once.
– Katie Strang, senior investigations and enterprise writer

42. Jerry Maguire (1996)
Average rating: 81.45

It’s personal. I used to want to be a sports agent, and “Jerry Maguire” romanticized that lifestyle better than any other film. It also hit on so many powerful themes: trust, loyalty, love, friendship, flaws, failures, successes and fresh starts. And from “Show me the money” to “You had me at hello,” it contained countless memorable quotes. Call it corny. I’ll always call it a classic.
– Mayberry

43. The Fighter (2010)
Average rating: 81.44

There are a lot of boxing movies on our list. Creating real world action is a bit easier in boxing movies and the energy for intimate narratives just hits harder. Well, “The Fighter” reaches all those intimate notes and then some. Mark Wahlberg’s underrated portrayal of Micky Ward is somber and heartfelt, but Christian Bale electrifies as his off-kilter brother whose battles with demons give the film its emotional heft. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo (who won an Oscar for her portrayal as a tough-as-glass-shards mom) also showcase praiseworthy performances.
– Khalid Salaam, national NBA editor

44. The Damned United (2009)
Average rating: 81.14

Imagine a headstrong Air Raid coach taking over a college football program that loves to run the ball. That was Brian Clough at Leeds United. The Damned United focuses on Clough’s tumultuous tenure, which lasted only 44 days. Michael Sheen is a tour de force, portraying an arrogant, stubborn Clough hellbent on making a championship side play his way. It didn’t work, but the movie did as a window into life at the top of English football in the mid-’70s.
– Masisak

45. North Dallas Forty (1979)
Average rating: 80.57

I was 9 or 10 when I first saw “North Dallas Forty” with my dad. A lot of the film’s message — that players are disposable parts in a huge machine that spits out money — was over my head at that point but I really enjoyed the behind-the-scenes look at a pro team. From inside the huddle to the locker room to the parties to the “Breakfast of Champions” — a Budweiser and pain pills. Nick Nolte and Mac Davis, as the broken-down receiver and his quarterback, were great carrying the movie through some uneven parts. It was funny — my dad quoted Davis for weeks — and had heart, and even in later viewings I always enjoyed the non-storybook ending.
– Vic Tafur, Las Vegas Raiders beat writer

46. The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings (1976)
Average rating: 80.54

In the ’80s, there were a couple of movies that seemed to be on HBO all the time, classics like “Mr. Mom” and “Midnight Madness,” but the baseball movie that would be on — and I’d watch — was this one. Before he was Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams was Bingo Long (although, in my young head he was Lando first and then I found Bingo Long), but both shared the charisma that Williams oozed. Williams was a perfect fit for a Satchel Paige-like character, while Darth Vader (James Earl Jones) is a Josh Gibson-type and the heart of the film. Much like its subject matter, this film doesn’t get the attention that some of its more mainstream counterparts receive, but its place among baseball movies shouldn’t be forgotten.
– C. Trent Rosecrans, senior MLB writer

47. Everybody Wants Some!! (2016)
Average rating: 80.33

This is the spiritual cousin of “Dazed and Confused,” so if you want a movie with a big game at the end, this ain’t it. But if you want to watch Finn and Willoughby and Jake and Roper and Plummer and the rest of a 1980 college baseball team go to parties, meet girls and have a great time, this movie is so damned good.
– Hugh Kellenberger, college basketball executive editor

48. He Got Game (1998)
Average rating: 80.24

Spike Lee. Denzel. Public Enemy. Jim Brown. Ray Allen holding his own. What more do you need, other than a better choice for an accompanying soundtrack for a movie about the seedy underbelly of the recruiting game? Allen gives a raw and unflinching depiction of a young star in the crosshairs of big-time college athletics, money-hungry agents and all of the pitfalls that come with overwhelming talent. Denzel Washington is remarkable as Jake Shuttlesworth, and you can feel Lee preaching from the director’s chair throughout.
– Jon Krawczynski, senior writer

49. Foxcatcher (2014)
Average rating: 80.21

“Foxcatcher” is one of those special movies where there is a mood of tension right from the start. There’s the hunched-over mannerisms of Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo, so accurately portraying Olympic wrestlers with those gigantic rounded backs and T-Rex arms. Steve Carrell turns in a painful and haunting performance as “John DuPont of the DuPont Family” that would seem absurd if the whole thing wasn’t based on a true story. It’s simply a great drama that happens to center on sports.
– Jared Weiss, Celtics writer and Daily Ding host

50. Uncut Gems (2019)
Average rating: 80.16

There’s so much to like about “Uncut Gems,” from the casting (Kevin Garnett’s very good!) to the constant background noise that really makes you feel the stress of a sports bettor walking an all-time tightrope (or at least what I imagine that would be like). It’s so immersive that the insanity of betting opening-tip props as part of already-longshot parlays manages to feel normal. In a time of no sports, watching this movie is a hell of a way to get the adrenaline pumping.

Hey everyone, back by **No** demand whatsoever, part 3 of our installment of going through the entire Godzilla main movie series. I’m going to keep this going if it kills me.

I realized that the last post was long as hell so doing two movies in the same post may be too much, so from now on, these will be doing one movie at a time. 

As always, if you're not sure what this is about, [take a glance at part 1 to get an idea.](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fnn8i6/lets_talk_about_godzilla_king_of_the_monsters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) 

# [Mothra vs. Godzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U88kjtZoYYw) (1964)

AKA Godzilla vs. The Thing (for the Americans)

[Where to watch](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/godzilla-vs-the-thing)

[As always if you want to skip my overview and get a more barebones plotline, just check out the wiki plot.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothra_vs._Godzilla#Plot)

Ok so, apparently theres a lead up to this movie with a Mothra movie that came out in 1961 but I never saw that movie, so this is the first time seeing Mothra for me. But lets jump into this movie for anyone that is still with me!

**Overview:**

It was a dark and stormy night….when this movie starts. Like literally, it is dark and stormy. Some kind of typhoon or some shit just fucking up this coastline during the opening credits. 

The next day, we get our main characters, a man who writes for a newspaper and a woman who takes pictures for the newspaper. 

This woman is awful at her job. She tries to be all artsy and barely takes any photos of anything. You can tell she just slept her way into that job. The guy, Ichi has to keep telling her to take pictures. A damn newspaper photographer has to be reminded to take photos!

They find some piece of colorful trash that’s meant to be important but I can't remember what it is or what it is for. 

But forget that, there's a huge egg floating in the bay. Like YUGE. As big as a house, all decked out like an Easter egg

Is the government going to take the egg and research it? Is the egg going to be left alone and observed with the proper security precautions in case it hatches into a monster? That’s what you'd think. Enter our bad guy: Japanese businessman with a hitler stache. He just “buys” the egg from the fishermen that got it out of the water. Totally legit. Only paid the equivalent of about $50,000 for it too. Fucking steal. 

Anyways, hitler stache businessman works for an EVILER businessman who is going to build an amusement park around the egg and make whatever hatches an attraction. And just so you know how rich and evil this guy is, he just has a hoard of money stowed away he probably sleeps on like a dragon. 

Mothra’s guardian fairies show up, and they are [ADORABLE](https://imgur.com/gallery/PnBoiqv). I mean look at their outfits! And they’re tiny! Like 6 inches tall. Anyway, they plead with the evil businessmen to return Mothra’s egg, but of course, being evil sons of bitches, they try to capture the fairies and put them in the amusement park. However, they escape, cutely. 

Back to our main characters, they go to the woods, for some reason…and meet the fairies who in turn give us a lot of exposition:

**1. Its Mothra's egg**

**2. They’re from infant island, an island that was used as a nuclear testing site**

**3. The typhoon from earlier washed away Mothra's egg out to see where it floated to Japan.** 

**4. People still live on that island and worship Mothra and hate outsiders. Would probably hate people too if they dropped nuclear bombs on me.** 

The gang, which now composes of 3 people, Ichi, the girl who is awful at her job, and some new guy, I really don’t know where he came from, decides to help the fairies get Mothra’s egg. Then they see a GIANT ASS MOTH just sitting on a hill. How has no one noticed this damn airplane sized moth yet?! It flaps its wings weakly once and a strong wind rushes through the forest, its got some kick!

Our characters decide to try and get the public on their side by writing newspaper articles to coerce the bad guys into giving the egg back, but it doesn’t work, and the fairies hitch a ride on Mothra back to Infant Island.

Why Mothra just doesn’t go ahead and take back its own egg is beyond me.

Our heroes go meet a professor who was trying to study the egg and they find out that the colorful trash they found at the beginning is highly radioactive. Still don’t know what it is. They go to the site where the typhoon flooded the coast to check for more radiation

Where the fuck is Godzilla?! This is Godzilla vs. Mothra right? Is he ever going to show up?

Well finally 33 minutes into the movie, Godzilla comes busting out of the ground like a giant Diglett! Apparently he was washed in by the typhoon and buried. He’s still groggy, but goes on a rampage anyway, you know, while he’s there. Some dark desperate music plays while he blows some stuff up

You can tell Godzilla still hasn’t woken up completely. He gets his tail caught in a tower, trips himself, almost sprains his ankle falling into a ditch. He’s pretty clumsy.

Our 3 heroes decide to go to Infant Island to ask for Mothra’s help in stopping Godzilla. They go to the island which is just completely desolate. Skeletons, bare rocks, and [some weird-ass](https://imgur.com/gallery/U4M9c2q)[ looking turtle?](https://imgur.com/gallery/U4M9c2q) What the hell even is at that thing?! We’ll never know!

Anyways, our heroes get captured by the tribal people. They deny their plea for help from Mothra. Dropping nuclear bombs on people will really make them hate you apparently. The characters listen to [a beautiful song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHEGAuqLsH8) by the fairies, make a very sincere plea to them and Mothra agrees to help, but she will die. Really beautiful scene overall. 

Back to our King of the Monsters. The military decides to try shocking him to death. Since apparently that was super effective against Godzilla in his bout with Kong.

Our bad guy with the hitler stache has had enough. He goes to the more eviler and richer bad guy and just beats the shit out of him til he’s bloody. He’s tired of being taken advantage of stache guy steals the wads of cash from the eviler richer guy. But oh Lawd, Godzilla’s coming. The eviler richer guy shoots the stache guy in the back of the head while he’s stealing money, but he gets crushed underneath the building Godzilla destroys while trying to make his escape. A+ for comeuppance.

Mothra shows up just in time to save her egg from about being destroyed by Godzilla. Mothra proceeds to fuck Godzilla up by using Gust. Its super effective! Shits flying everywhere. Buildings and trees being ripped from the ground by Mothra keeps using Gust. Mothra then grabs Godzilla’s tail and drags him away from her egg while Godzilla is clawing for his life. He is really struggling. Mothra keeps fucking Godzilla up! Attacking his head and eventually using Poisonpowder! But, its not very effective! Godzilla gets an atomic breath shot on Mothra and she goes and dies covering her egg. She has spent the last of her energy. 

The military takes over and does their plan. With horrendous accuracy. But they do manage to light Godzilla's head and tail on fire. They try shocking Godzilla to death, and it seems to work for a while, but they try to turn up the juice too much and everything just melts. 

Anyways, the egg begins to hatch and….AND…..Its TWINS! Two ugly larvae that look like the penis of a 110-year-old sailor. They immediately go after Godzilla while the fairies chant the mothra theme. The two larvae chase after Godzilla chugging along like trains. And they actually use train noises for their movements. No lie. It is cute as hell. One larva makes a huge mistake and bites Godzilla's tail. He thrashes around, tossing the little larvae against rocks and the ground and then beats the shit out of the little guy with his tail when the larvae lets go. 

Shit, that didn’t work, so what are they going to do? Hide in the rocks and spam String Shot. They keep this up, ducking behind some rocks (which, hilariously enough, just deflate when blasted by Godzilla. No not melt. Deflate. Like a balloon. Rocks now.) while covering Godzilla in their silk spray until he is completely covered and falls into the ocean, assumed defeated. The two victorious larvae swim their way back to infant island as the humans wave farewell as the fairies sing their beautiful song until the end. 

**Plot: 10/10**

The story is not overly simplistic but not too hard to follow either. There are definite good guys/bad guys and you have a resolution from all angles in this movie. Very well written and executed. The story of the redemption of the people and rebirth of Mothra and rebuilding of trust fits and is communicated well. The best overall story so far in a Godzilla movie. 

**Characters: 9/10**

Despite the girl being terrible at her job, the characters were pretty well utilized and fleshed. They fit archetypes in the plot while not being too stereotypical. I actually didn’t mind watching the human parts, which is saying something for these movies. The fairies really are the best characters. And they will be a staple in many other movies in this series. 

**Monsters: 8/10**

Godzilla looks different in this movie, as he has looked different in every movie thus far. I guess the new suit provided more flexibility because Godzilla seemed to have more realistic movements. And Godzilla was emoted a lot better in this movie. Wasn’t too much a fan of his face in this one, however. Mothra looked OK. Not great, not terrible. The larvae are just so ugly they’re cute. 

**Monster Fights: 8/10**

While the monster fights were relatively brief with lots of cuts, the second battle with Godzilla vs. Mothra larvae was more consistent and you really root for the little guys. They continued to use actors acting in front of screens for a good few parts, but it wasn’t too cheesy and done well. It really adds to the sense of scale you sometimes lose for these monsters, even if the visuals are affected and the background is left looking blurry. You really get to see Godzilla get fucked up in this movie, which is sort of new for the series. They don’t lag but aren’t too overly impressive. 

**Enjoyability Factor: 9/10**

This is a must-watch. It sets up Mothra for those that don’t or haven’t seen the standalone Mothra movies. The plot really makes the movie in this one. The effects are pretty good for their time, and you will have a good time with this one. Like the very first Godzilla (1954) this is just a good movie. The music is wonderful and fits the tone. The battles are interesting and well-choreographed. You will like this movie.",2,1585587620,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fruk1q/lets_talk_about_godzilla_king_of_the_monsters/,movies,1

frujnv,ThePharros,What the hell is going on with Rotten Tomatoes? Their critic reviews feel so artificial and detached from reality.,"I've been spending time during this pandemic to watch some films on Netflix, and what this has taught me is that RT is either extremely out of touch with the real world, someone is paying off these critics, or something else is going on that I'm missing.

There is absolutely no way these ""critics"" are watching the same movies I and others are. What they refer to as ""masterpieces"" with underlying themes or clever works are in reality mediocre time killers. Plots are linear and as deep as a puddle, with 2-dimensional characters and loose ends left and right. Parts that don't make sense aren't some clever hidden details you'd see in actually good movies like *Parasite*, for example. Reveals in these aforementioned movies are far from unexpected. Critical thinking is optional.

I am so dumbfounded from the critic reviews on RT. All these movies have high critic ratings, but poor user ratings. And the user ratings are 100% accurate. What the hell is going on with these critics??

**P.S.** If anyone is curious of some examples, check out the RT page for [Girl on the Third Floor](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/girl_on_the_third_floor) or [Sweetheart](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweetheart). These are movies that I'd consider something watch if you're really bored, but nothing I'd ever recommend, and the user reviews are far more accurate than the critics' reviews. To be fair, most of these movies had some good acting and special effects, so it is less so the budget restrictions as it is the writing.",8,1585587585,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frujnv/what_the_hell_is_going_on_with_rotten_tomatoes/,movies,1

fru2mv,ChipThompson,Remaking Die Hard - Lockdown/Isolation project,"Hello everyone, 

Firstly, apologies if this goes against any of the rules here (feel free to remove or let me know and I'll take it down). Now to the point - I had an idea for a quarantine/lockdown/isolation project everyone could get involved in. I want to remake Die Hard, word for word, but with a different person saying each line in the script. So far I've had about 100 people get involved just sharing the project through Facebook and Twitter but I wanted to open it up more (there's a lot of dialogue in the script!)

For anyone  wanting to get involved, it would work like this; I'd assign you a random line of dialogue from the film, you'd then film yourself on your phone performing the line, send it back to me and I'd edit them all together until we had the whole film done!

Now, depending on numbers you might get more than one line (very likely, lots to get through!) so even if you got an average one to begin with ""Ms Genero"", you might get a ""shoot the glass"" later! You could perform your line anyway you wanted, I'm encouraging as much creative freedom as possible. 

And that's pretty much it! Hopefully this continues to interest people from all over the world and we'll see if we can remake Die Hard from the comfort of our own homes.

I am looking for movies that are tough to watch, controversial and polemical, where the characters have to make difficult ethical decisions or are faced with difficult moral dilemmas or where the plot is hard to stomach or disturbing. I don't necessarily mean horror movies.

I just finished watching Compliance (2012), which I strongly recommend you watch in case you haven't yet, and yesterday I watched a gem of a film starring Kevin Bacon called The Woodsman (2004), which was a really difficult and at times unsettling watch, albeit a very interesting and thought-provoking one. I can't wait to watch it again.

Any recommendations?

If it’s something that particularly interests me, I’ll even eschew trailers. This way, I get to watch films on my own terms, and 100% make up my own mind about them.  Only after I watch the movie do I them search and read articles and reviews about them.  Even though I wanted to watch this one in the theater, it didn’t happen, so I waited for it to come to Redbox. Which brings us to today. 

First of all, I loved the film.  I am old enough that the original film was part of my heritage, having lived through the era when global thermonuclear war was an ever-present fear. *Terminator* and its sequel, *Judgment Day*, tapped directly into that fear with high-voltage lines and made something incredibly compelling. 

I was not at all a fan of *Rise of the Machines*.  Hated it. Without James Cameron, the franchise lost everything, to me. I didn’t mind *Salvation*, though.  I thought it showed some promise, but the fact was that with the Cold War over, the entire storyline seemed dated at that point.  I won’t even talk about *Genisys* or the TV shows. 

So here we are today, with *Dark Fate* having been a box office bomb, even though reviews from both the press and fans has been [mostly positive](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_dark_fate).  But this also happened with the original film. T2 only got made because the original became a cult classic via videotape.  

I was surprised to learn that [there is a trilogy planned for this new storyline](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/what-happens-terminator-dark-fate-1251736), and sad to learn that because of the lackluster box office receipts, the sequels most likely won’t be filmed.  

I think this is a mistake, and I believe we have the power to change that.  Just as fans showed their love for *Terminator* via rentals after the box office, which gave us the monumental T2, I believe we can spur the realization of this planned trilogy by the same love. If it really exists. 

It certainly exists here, in my mind. I hope it does also on a much larger scale. I would absolutely love to see the remainder of the story told on the big screen. It deserves so much more than the small screen and streaming.  

After all, the whole point of these great films is that we choose our future.  I choose the brilliance of James Cameron and hope to see the final story of Sarah Connor, Dani and Grace shown with the cinematic justice it deserves.",15,1585584287,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frtika/way_late_to_the_party_but_i_just_finished/,movies,1

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

It’s really the only thing I have to sort of reground myself, and kind of get a break from real life. I love complicated, action and drama filled movies just as much as anyone else sometimes, but it’s really hard to find good movies for me to watch in my episodes. The smallest thing can set everything off again twice as hard. I rented Frozen 2 yesterday thinking a “feel good kid’s movie” would help and I spent the entire time holding back tears. Not for any reason in particular, it was just so dramatic and stressful it gave me anxiety and doubled the depression. The closest I’ve found is cheesy, admittedly pretty shitty teen romcoms because teenage problems don’t give me anxiety anymore. But even those usually have some kind of dramatic stressful cheating situation or some shit. I just want to watch a movie and feel good, and not spend a longer amount of time than a movie would even run trying to pick one out.",41,1585583899,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frte3n/happy_simple_movie_suggestions_for_really_bad/,movies,1

frtcbt,Procrastinating-101,Movies similar to The Voices? (Marjane Sartrapi)," Looking for any recommendations you think are similar to this movie in some way.

Here are some of the things I really loved about it:

\- the overall atmosphere, it really creates its own world visually

\- subject matter, a really interesting portrayal of mental illness that I dont think I have ever seen before. I don't enjoy movies that are really bleak throughout, so the scene where he takes the medication was a very clever way to have the bleakness really hit, but not be the entire experience of the movie (don't really know how to explain myself there, hope it's clear). It deals with such a serious matter in a more 'creative' or whimsical type of way.

**- the fantastical mixed with the really f\*cked up,** and especially the 'dark' tone it handles thoughout: related to the previous point. I really like 'dark' films, particularly dark comedies (is this even a comedy in your opinion?), and this film has such a unique tone in my opinion. The tone(s) (and tonal shifts) and overall feeling of the movie is what I loved the most about it.

Don't know if I was super clear, but I just really enjoy this movie and don't know of anything similar. If you think a film might be similar or just want to discuss this wonderful film please comment :)

frsws4,cinemacahier,I’m tired of non-cinephiles hating on me,"I have to vent; being cooped up in quarantine in with a family that does not support my love for cinema is hard, not merely because I’m unable to share my love for cinema with them, but because I actually get mocked for it.

Being a cinephile had both its ups and downs. By really big cinephiles I was often criticized I don’t know enough about film, and by “cinephile haters” I was told I talk way too much about cinema. The thing with cinema is it’s something I’m completely self-educated in, I have watched many films, read many books and articles about them before I ever began framing my own opinion. And by the time I did start to open up about my passion, the amount of backlash has made me hesitant to ever share this passion with anyone.

I understand what it’s like to be surrounded by someone who wants to talk about about only ONE thing over and over again, it can be frustrating, particularly because not everyone is interested in it, and can hardly join in the conversation. I have an annoying habit that when someone says they really liked a movie I would jump in to say “that was directed by this and this director, and did you know they also directed-“ followed by this “I really couldn’t give a shit” facial expression. So I learned to back down a bit and not talk about film all the time.

But now what’s happening is that film is being brought up on its own and talked about in a way that is meant to undermine its importance. My sister started talking about  “Rear Window” mispronouncing Hitchcock’s name as if pronouncing his name right is of no importance. She is not dumb, she very well knows how to pronounce Hitchcock’s name, referring to him as this “hicky guy,” and she was clearly doing it on purpose. She then went on to state that “Psyco” is a shitty film. Ok?? You can say you don’t like it, but to call it a shitty film? And she does this a LOT, pretending she doesn’t know a director’s name, inviting me to intervene and correct her and then to get backlash for “useless information.”

Look, you don’t have to be a cinephile. You don’t have to know all the names of film directors and who directed what. But Hitchcock is just general culture. And there’s absolutely no need to hate on people who do know these things. It may not be YOUR priority, but to some people film means a lot more than that. I don’t see why people have to mock other people’s passions. It is really uncalled for.",10,1585582313,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frsws4/im_tired_of_noncinephiles_hating_on_me/,movies,1

My three picks, from most to least, are...

1. Johnny Depp
2. Joaquin Phoenix
3. Matthew McConaughey

frqq2d,rhoades2rocky43,We Filmed The Shining At Our Movie Theater,"A few months ago, me and my friends who are all employees at a movie theater here in Pennsylvania decided to make The Shining for our theater. We make a show for youtube and thought it would be fun to do this. 

So changing it just a little bit, we tried recreating scenes from The Shining with all of us who work here. It was a blast to make and now with the theater closed until further notice due to the outbreak, I decided to finally release it. I know it is only a short (2 Part episodes) and this subreddit is movies but I thought there may be some who would enjoy this.

Our version follows Derric, who is asked to watch after the theater for just an evening while the boss is out. During this time, Derric is isolated in a theater with no customers and two employees, one who is slowly driving him insane. Something evil is lurking the theater halls.

If you enjoy The Shining and are in the mood to check it out, that would be pretty awesome. We have a lot of fun making these and hopefully when the theater opens again we can do more movie spoofs/recreations.

Until then, I hope you enjoy The Cinema.

frq36g,ToastedSkoops,Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016),I finally watched this tonight. It was hilarious! My brother-in-law and I are huge Lonely Island fans but we both had little kids when this movie came out and we haven’t had a “guys night” together until tonight. I saved this movie since it came out even though I have wanted to watch it so badly since it came out. People do not realize how difficult it is to make a great comedy. This movie was so funny - we laughed the entire time. Most comedies these days elicit maybe a chuckle but mostly just disappointment. This had a joke every second and was just thoroughly entertaining. Loved it and highly recommend! I’m shocked it wasn’t a bigger “hit.”,94,1585572149,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frq36g/popstar_never_stop_never_stopping_2016/,movies,1

frpuws,StonerLoner93,"Need to talk about ""My Days of Mercy"" (2017) with Ellen Page &amp; Kate Mara","Just watched it, thought it was fantastic. Completely took me by surprise.

Honestly think it might be Ellen Page's best ever performance. She is phenomenal in this movie. Floored me.

Mara is charming &amp; has great chemistry with Page. The intimacy they brought along with great written dialogue was a joy to watch.

The older sister in the movie was also really good. The whole family dynamic with the complex brutal situation they're dealing with was realistic &amp; powerful.

Would definitely recommend if you haven't seen it.",1,1585571177,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frpuws/need_to_talk_about_my_days_of_mercy_2017_with/,movies,1

frp4ok,ExleyPearce,'Hud' (1963) - what a quartet of performances.,"Paul Newman just oozed screen presence in just about every role he ever had, but the interesting think here is that the titular character is when you get down to it, a pretty horrible jerk. So fascinating to see a star of his stature utilise that charisma of his for such a character - he makes Hud so fiercely real. Then you have on the opposite end, Melvyn Douglas as his father Homer. The yin and yang dynamic between the two is just incredible. Stern, yet with such warmth underlying it; firm yet not at all unfeeling. He deservedly won an Oscar for the role, as did Patricia Neal as the housekeeper Alma. Just like the other two gentlemen her performance is just so lived-in. Every witty retort comes so naturally, and you really get a sense of her character's strong personality and troubled past even just from a glance. Brandon de Wilde as Homer's grandson and Hud's nephew, Lonnie, was the only one who wasn't nominated for an Oscar. What a shame - since he's the glue required for the film to work as well as it does. The wavering uncertain heart to the film as he flits between grandfather and uncle; such an understated, powerful performance.",3,1585567979,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frp4ok/hud_1963_what_a_quartet_of_performances/,movies,1

froenq,rudz97,Why is Darth Vader so popular?,"I am not really a Star Wars fan. I watched them all tho and mostly because they were popular. None of the movies really affected me. I never felt like rewatching any one of them. Tho i acknowledge how important and ground breaking the original trilogy is. George Lucas surely had an inventive mind and he created an impressive world. Even if i am not any part of it, i've seen endless discussions about this series, the characters. Darth Vader seems to be the most popular one and i've seen him being referred to as the greatest villain ever, by a lot of people...and...i just don't get it. The character or anything about him never left any impression on me. I actually thought the costume was kinda...dumb and then i peer into the things being said about him and none of them really resonates with me.

fro0d2,JXTPE,To all the Blade Runner fans out there.....,"I took some time recently to watch Blade Runner (final cut) for the first time and surprisingly, it seemed underwhelming. The plot was hard to follow, characters kind of dull, and action extremely minimal.

&amp;#x200B;

But after letting it digest for a few days, I just want to watch it again, and I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I realized is the beauty of the movie lies in its atmosphere; it just sucks you in and makes you feel like you are part of their 2019 Los Angeles. People feel real: sad and alone, and most importantly, relatable. There is a sense of isolation, with a constant questioning of the value of life and whether we are in-fact losing our humanity. I won't spoil too much for anyone who hasn't seen it but it is just amazing how a world could feel so immersive and addicting while being so messed up and dirty.

I'm now eagerly awaiting for A Hidden Life to become available to watch here in Australia. But now I wanted to go a bit more out of my comfort zone and experience some films I'd never come across without a recommendation from someone online or a friend. I've heard little about Tarkovsky but the little I've heard really got my intrigued so I thought let's give his films a go. I've got Ivan's Childhood up on my TV and ready to go and I'm very keen. Just thought I'd share this here if anyone could relate to watching a certain directors full filmography for the first time or opinions about Tarkovsky or anything of the sort.

frmgiu,capfedhill,"Arrival, COVID-19, and non-zero sum games","I rewatched Arrival last night for the first time in a couple years, and man, what an amazing film. I decided to give it a rewatch because the environment in the world right now was reminding me of the movie. All of the countries in the world were working together to understand the ""threat"" -- and in some cases, working against each other. Criticizing each other on their methods of interacting with the ""threat"". 

It was all very reminiscent on how countries are currently dealing with COVID-19. In one scene there is a TV playing in Louise's bedroom where the news reporter describes the record-breaking day of the DOW dropping by 2,000 points -- I chuckled at this scene, as this just happened a couple weeks ago.

But I wanted to talk about non-zero sum games. A big theme of the movie was how the alien situation was a non-zero sum game, and all of the countries needed to work together to gain the net benefit. While this is completely true, I also think the non-zero sum game applied to Louise's life.

[There is a reddit post from 6 months ago where the OP makes his case for Louise being a ""totally horrible person"".](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dap9lr/is_the_main_character_from_arrival_a_totally/) But I disagree. Louise asks Ian at one point near the end something along the lines of, ""if you knew what the future would bring, would you do anything different?"" Louise obviously has her doubts about the future. She knows the pain she will feel when Ian leaves her, and when her daughter Hannah succumbs to cancer. But Louise also mentions at one point that ""it is better to have loved and lost than never loved at all"". 

To me, Louise's life is also a non-zero sum game. The pain and heartbreak she feels will not outweigh the love and joy that is gained by her relationship with Ian and time spent with Hannah. No matter how low the ""net losses"" will be, ultimately the choices she makes will result a ""net benefit"" for herself, Ian, and Hannah.

Beautiful movie and an absolute masterpiece.

frlm9g,jammyjolly54,My thoughts on The Lion King (2019) (just rambling),"So I finally got around to watching the live action remake of this childhood classic and all I got to say is it's ok.

Obviously the cgi is amazing and the voice actors are really good but for me it's missing the heart and spirit of the original one. Maybe it's because the remade it shot for shot and didn't really change a whole lot. They didn't really give it it's own identity like the Jungle Book remake did. Listening to the songs in the movie just made we want to put on the original, and let's be real here, Nathan Lane and  Ernie Sabella are the only voices for Timon and Pumbaa, nothing against Seth or Billy.

Not trashing the movie, this is just frozen pizza. Yes if you're craving pizza and that's all you have at the time, it'll do but it doesn't really compare to the real thing.",9,1585549349,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frlm9g/my_thoughts_on_the_lion_king_2019_just_rambling/,movies,1

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

frkqaw,ObnoxiousSeizures,Looking for movies with the same feel as this scene.,"Now, let me preface this by saying that I would love recommendations on films based purely off the *mood* of this scene, completely independent from the actual content. 

This is the opening scene to 'All the Bright Places'. The ambient noise, the coloring, the mood, the slight haze, etc. That is what I'm looking for.

Here's the scene:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70CTvqNMdv8

Additional films that I would consider to have this mood that I'm looking for are:
Harold and Maude
Columbus
Little Women (2019)
The Before Trilogy (to an extent)

I can only describe it as, like, the feeling of walking out of your house in the morning after it has rained. 

I would love recommendations for more films like this. I don't know what it is that is so compelling and comforting to me, but it would be much appreciated.

Also, please be forewarned, I will probably be nitpicky about what films I consider to have this very, very specific mood. I am just desperate to find the exact aspect that grips me. I will try to avoid being annoying about it.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

3. Psychological or Film Noir 

4. Feel-Good, Sometimes Comedy

frk13k,Boogi29,Bone Tomahawk is one of the best westerns I've seen.,"This is easily the most gritty and intense Western I've ever seen. I legitimately cannot think of another Western that made me feel such horror at the lives of those who lived in the old west. I know the Troglodytes are overaccentuated Indians, but holy fuck I'd be horrified to run into them. In addition, the decision to not have a score or soundtrack throughout any major part of the film added an intense amount of suspense and brutality. And of course, there was ""that scene"" and man, it's just horrific.

 I've watched all of Zahlers films and I honestly have to say this is his best one.

friy2k,munyrags,Ignoring Plot to Enjoy a Movie,"This has done wonders for me on a first viewing.

When focused on plot I would be impatient with a film if it was taking too long to get to the next plot point. I'm ashamed to say but I've turned movies off in the first 10 minutes cause of this.

But with my new attitude I've really started enjoying a films atmosphere, mood, hanging out with the characters and just being in the world. I especially enjoy movies set outdoors during this COVID situation.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has been particularly great for me. I could rewatch the Playboy Mansion party scene a million billion times. 

Anyone else feel this way or have an alternative way to enjoy films on a first viewing?",13,1585536936,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/friy2k/ignoring_plot_to_enjoy_a_movie/,movies,1

""I just saw ***[near universally critically acclaimed movie and/or well-established reddit-bro favourite]*** for the first time and, oh boy, I gotta say; it's a masterpiece!  

The cinematography is amazing, the performances are fantastic (especially by [ACCLAIMED LEAD ACTOR]) and the editing is great. I put off watching it for so long and, boy, was I wrong; it's the best [example of genre] I've ever seen!

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

I would cast Oscar Isaac as Michael, Robert DeNiro as Vito (I know, I know, a little too easy), Michael Fassbender as Sonny, Tom Hiddleston as Tom Hagen, Morena Baccarin as Connie, Jason Schwartzman as Fredo, Ed Harris as McCluskey, Michael Douglas as Jack Woltz. I do not know who I would cast as Clemenza, the rival mob bosses, or Mama Corleone.

friayb,RelocationWoes,Why did Timothy Treadwell (Grizzly Man) film 13 years worth of footage but never actually share it?," I don't understand this very obvious and fundamental question. It's not addressed even once in the documentary, and I've tried searching for answers on it through Google... it doesn't seem like anyone's even asking this question! The only results that even come up are people obsessed with his death audio.

This man had 13 years of footage accumulated. Hours after hour, day after day, for 2-3 months, for 13 years... it's insane to think of the sheer volume of material.

This guy clearly fancied himself not just as a bear advocate/protector, but a filmmaker.

So why didn't he ever release any of the footage, ever? Why would he just painstakingly record these bears for over a DECADE and not even try to share it with another human?

I know he did public speaking and educational speaking, but everything I've read says he simply gave talks / stories / photo slideshows.

There would have been SO many ways for him to get his material out: public access, direct-to-video, selling it to a network, literally anything! In a world where far dumber people with absolutely dreadful material have had ZERO problems broadcasting their material (hell, does anyone remember Tom Green having his own show in Canada?)... this certainly is not an explanation.

So what's the explanation? My only guess... is that it's part of the whole mental health issues he dealt with his whole life. He clearly had a ton of problems, and a huge persecution complex which developed into a martyr-like complex.

I feel like the videos he took we never even intended to be seen by others. It was just some sort of weird personal diary/universe that he was the complete and total controller over, where no one could scrutinize/criticize/react or even comment on the narrative he was telling.

In a weird way, I feel like he was very much a public figure but the videos were always private for him... maybe he'd even have objected to the documentary using his footage.

Anyway, I'm speculating. But I'm very annoyed that there's been no discussion on this. What gives?",12,1585534298,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/friayb/why_did_timothy_treadwell_grizzly_man_film_13/,movies,1

But man, something about the reboot is just off. It feels more juvenile than the other movies, but it's really not. The humor is more or less the same, but it just doesn't hit for me. I don't know what it is. 

I think it's almost too meta? Can a movie be that? It just feels really in your face and obvious, but not in a good way. The other movies didn't try and jam as many cameos as possible and do non-stop inside jokes so I'm not sure why this one decided to

I really want to like this movie. I do like nearly every Kevin Smith movie, but I'm struggling to even finish it

It's like when Undertaker retired, but then he kept coming back and embarrassing himself and now it's affecting your opinion of his prime years

frh7b9,saxobroko,"About Time, a movie not talked about often enough","At first it seems like a rom com with a slight time travel twist, and that is true but this film is so much more. It's a film as much about life and living it and the joys and highs and lows and it's all shown in an entertaining fashion. 

It's a film about people and choices and the consequences of those choices. Sometimes there's nothing that can be done to help other people, not even if you can travel through time. 

It's a film about appreciating the good things in life. 

I enjoyed About Time and I recommend it to everyone to give it a shot.

frgvpm,crepesoda,Can someone please tell me when War Dogs was released on Amazon Prime?,"My wife and I have been in a three year long debate over whether we watched War Dogs together or not. It’s not a movie that either one of us would choose to put on (no diss to the actors or director) nor is it something that either of us have really heard anything about since. Still, I know I’ve watched it and I am dead certain it was with her. I just need for someone to tell me the date that it was released on Amazon Prime (the streaming service that we would have used). Once we have that piece to the puzzle, one of us (probably her) can finally claim victory. 

Now, because I have to write 300 words here, I’ll write a quick story about how we got to this point. To the best of my recollection, she and I sat down one evening when we first started dating and wanted to watch something. I believe that this movie was either free or close to on the old Amazons and so we chose to watch it. Now from there all I can remember is the movie plot and maybe some popcorn. After that, it’s pretty blurry. But... I know (or at least think that I know) that it was on her couch in her old apartment. Again, if one of you incredible humans can just tell me when it was released on Amazon, we’ll be one step closer to getting to the bottom of whether she’s seen this movie or not.

frgg1z,RadProX,"Takashi Miike's ""13 Assassins""","Last night I, on a whim, turned on ""13 Assassins"" with no idea on what to expect, having never seen a Miike film before. Suffice to say, I was transfixed the entire time. It felt like Miike had watched a bunch of Kurosawa samurai films and decided to replicate the spirit of those, while adding in his own violent twists. The climactic battle scene, lasting around 45 minutes long, was an exhilarating piece of cinema and never once got boring. It's a smart, bloody, and surprisingly heroic film. There is no question that, among the most popular samurai films out of Japan, ""13 Assassins"" earns a place near the top.

If I had to pick out a detraction, I'd say that some of the characters were lacking in development (particularly a few of the titular assassins), but the main players were well acted and projected a powerful gravitas to their roles, Koji Yakusho and Goro Inagaki being the standouts (Inagaki in particular, as his part as the villain helped craft a thoroughly despicable antagonist that could easily find a home amongst like-minded peers from Game of Thrones).

Needless to say, I want to see more of what Miike has on tap, though with 100+ films to his name, picking one to watch next might be a challenge.

What are your thoughts on this film and which Miike films should I definitely seek out next?",30,1585527134,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frgg1z/takashi_miikes_13_assassins/,movies,1

But man do I have to say this movie surpassed even my largest possible expectations.   Vince Vaughn is unbelievable in this movie and you forget you are even watching him.
This is possibly the goriest movie I've seen and I never wanted to look away from the screen.  At one point I paused the movie and laughed out loud and asked myself what the heck am I watching.  But in the best possible way.  

Man what a fantastic movie this is, and I highly recommend it",62,1585524308,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frfo12/brawl_in_cell_block_99_is_a_masterpiece/,movies,12

frf6vc,Reckless_Delinquent,Quick Knives Out question,"So, I've just finished watching Knives Out and overall, I quite enjoyed it. But there was just one interaction in the film that has me scratching my head. In fact, i paused the movie and replayed the bits I could find with the characters involved to try and place it but couldn't.

In the scene, where Walt arrives at Marta's home to pressure her into renouncing her claim on the will he attempts to blackmail her using her mothers undocumented immigration status.

Walt says "".. You see what this kicks up with the press and the scrutiny, and we know... with your mother... ""

Marta replies ""...with my mother?....What did Meg tell you?""

Walt "" This isn't about who - you're missing the point, we're not attacking you with this. ""

Does anyone remember Marta actually telling Meg in the film about her mother? I can't recall. Is it just implied that there's some sort of close relationship between Marta and Meg? Is there a hole in the script here (maybe deliberately) to make you think about the ""isn't about who"" line from Walt? I kind of think that at some point in production Marta told Meg in the phonecall at the dinner with Ransom, but they've edited it out. 

I've had a quick glance at the script but couldn't find the scene where Marta told Meg. 

Bit of an odd question I guess, but with the ""who dunnit"" like this I like to have all my loose ends tidied up when watching.

This most recent watching of Total Recall has me thinking that maybe this is his best science fiction movie after all.  It's *way* better than I remember.  Extremely imaginative.  Surprisingly better acting than I had remembered (some of Arnie's best, that is of course relative though given both him and the genre, but still it's noticeable), some of the most original story-telling and the vision of life in the future as presented in this movie is really cool.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB. Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions). I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets. Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting. ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE. After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four. Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019. Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

Beyond that limit, there’s invisible orcs (or creatures) that want to get in the house and they can only be seen using a certain type of glasses. There’s also a magical being living inside the house which kinda represents a house elf, he’s small and has the ability to go invisible. The kids find a book talking about these magical creatures and go on an adventure to find who wrote the book, and in the end, a giant eagle saves them from a giant snake.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, I saw a slap stick comedy on italian television. I didn't understand a single word, but it was so ridiculous, I nearly pissed myself laughing. I hope someone knows the title!!!

&amp;#x200B;

It seemed to be a parody of the A-team. I'm not sure if Leslie Nielsen was in it, but somebody that looked a little bit like him. The story was that the team had to save a lady from some kind of villan. At one point, the protagonists dressed like a cow and sneaked into a fortress.

I really loved it then, but somehow i never rewatched it again. While rewatching it yesterday, i couldn't stop thinking about how fucking good this movie is! I was in awe from start to finish, and i couldn't believe how i waited so long before watching it again. Every single thing about this movie works perfectly: The atmosphere from the 40s and 50s classic noir movies, the dialogue, the plot... even the action scenes. Every single character in this movie is pure gold! The actors were all amazing, with not a single bad performance: Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, David Strathairn... and of course the three main characters played impeccably by Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce and Kevin Spacey. But the character who really stood out for me is Dudley. What a great character! And James Cromwell did a fantastic job portraying him. 

Anyway, has anyone else experienced this with a movie?

frc8mc,Fearless-Muffin,Probably been asked a million times...let's guess when theaters will reopen,"Obviously, the current world situation is fluid and constantly changing; at the end of the day, the most important thing is health and safety. And of course a big factor in opening up theaters will be that the virus cases/fatalities have a stall or severe downward trend.

When AMC released their closure, they said they will be closed ""for at least"" 12 weeks, and Regal executives have said closures would last about 2 months. Though this would point to about June- we know movies like WW84 which were intended to released in June were delayed.

I'm going to predict a September 4th reopen for theaters in waves; I think when theaters reopen it will have a lot of consumers be trepedatious of return so the September timeframe would be a good time as this is usually a slower time for movies.

Obviously, health and safety is most important above all-but what would you say your guesses for when movie theaters will reopen?",5,1585512219,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frc8mc/probably_been_asked_a_million_timeslets_guess/,movies,0

As far as I can remember it's about a high school student who draws a comic on his desk. 
More memory fragments: his teacher discovers his hidden talent and tries to help him, there's a scene where they go to a museum together to observe knight armors. The story of the comic is a metaphoric battle between knights and represents the kid's personal life where he struggles with his uncle who acts as a tyrant in the family.
The kid is latin-american (not sure) 
There's a scene where the teacher photocopies the desk to recreate full pages of the comic.

Here are some questions I had after watching it. I'm pretty sure I have more, but these are the ones I can think of for now. 

1. Why did Nam Il’s friend steal a suit? It didn’t appear to me that Nam Il changed.
2. Why did Nam Il say he doesn't know where Nam Joo is but then contacts her via cell?
3. Why did his friend keep asking about her?

(About the above questions, If Nam Il’s friend was purely using him for prize money then I understand why he wanted the sister too bc that would mean more prize money, but it looks like he helped Nam Il in the end???)

1. Did the friend actually betray Nam Il? Bc it looks like he gave him the correct password in the end on a sticky note?

frbq2m,Apocolyposaurus,A Fistful of Dollars,"Howdy cowpokes,

I'm running my brother on a Savage Worlds adventure (a dice rolling game like Dungeons and Dragons) that follows as closely as I can the plot from A Fistful of Dollars.

When Joe (the man with no name) sneaks into the Rojo camp to look for the gold it seems that he finds some small bags of gold in a barrel. This happens immediately before he accidentally knocks out Marisol and takes her to the Baxter camp.

So basically I'm looking to see whether or not he actually found the gold and stashed it away somehow.

frazb6,flourishersvk,First time watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy! I'm here to share my experience. Share yours too!,"Hey all! 

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I know I’m a few years late to the party haha. But take this as me sharing my experience of first time watching this amazing trilogy. It would be cool to read about you and how you people felt after watching LotR for the first time! So before I begin I want to state that I wasn’t living under the rock until a week ago. I just never was big into movies and with age I learned to enjoy a good movie either with someone or alone just relaxing. A few months ago I decided to watch movies that considered classics by people. I kicked it off with Star Wars, Matrix and so on. Now I’m a nurse and volunteered to work with COVID 19 patients so also sent my SO to her parents place at least until things get safer. So apartment to myself, no better time to get into this trilogy.

My favourite piece of cinematography used to be The Shining. I’m a huge fan of King’s books and Stanley Kubrick made the movie adaptation a masterpiece. That was until I finished The Lord of the Rings trilogy. And without further ado here’s my attempt at sharing my experience with you. 

&amp;#x200B;

The quick introduction of Middle Earth’s history was great. Dark history filled with death and then suddenly you’re in The Shire. With Hobbits running around and a Wizard. What got to me was the introduction of the one ring. I quickly learned what it was, how it was created and where it ended up. But during all of the next 9 hours I slowly learned about it’s true power. What it did to those who found it. Especially Smeagol. His existence alone  is extremely sad. Maybe some won’t agree with me but I don’t see him as a monster. He’s a victim to the ring, left to look for the ring and live in madness until the ring is destroyed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love how it started as adventure of two hobbits. And slowly they met others. And as the movie went on I quickly realised it won’t be only about these guys doing what they can to get to Mordor. And thank god for that because the stories that followed were unlike anything I’ve watched before. Seeing everyone slowly getting together despite strained relationships between races was just amazing. In epic fights from which it’s hard to choose one favourite. 

It’s probably a tie between the one at Helms Deep and one by the gates of Mordor.  First one because Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli were just epic in it and the second one because it made me cry haha. It was a not so huge amount of soldiers against the whole army of Mordor. Facing a certain death. In fights before there was always a hope reinforcements will come. But these were man marching to their death proudly. For Frodo. A sacrifice for two small hobbits that made a big sacrifice for whole Middle Earth. 

&amp;#x200B;

But to the point. I never before seen a word so beautifully and amazingly crafted. J. R. R. Tolkien was definitely one of a kind. From it’s history to the land, people, everything! Noble Elf with their own ancient language and beautiful cities. Orcs, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Wizards. 

Also there are some quotes I will not forget. If I’d have to pick one I couldn’t. But maybe wise words of Sam Gamgee: “There’s some good in this world Mr. Frodo.  And it’s worth fighting for.” I can see that as a tattoo too haha. 

In a way it sucks I got to watch this movie. Because I will hardly ever find something like this again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I’d describe the experience as heart-warming. Of course there’s sadness, death. I did cried more than once. But this movie just somehow touches your soul. There’s orcs, spiders, Nazgul, Sauron. But than there’s the Shire. Or just those warm moments these friends share. It’s hard to describe by words but it’s just heart warming. Epic. That’s probably the right word for these movies and Tolkien’s work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went in with a little bit of skepticism. 9 hours and what if half of it is just filler crap. It sucks it’s just those 9 hours. I could spend much more learning about Middle Earth. And I do I just finished watching The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. And after Hobbit I will probably order the books. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I know super late to the party but better late than never haha. Thank you for your time and have a great day!",19,1585507889,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frazb6/first_time_watching_the_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy/,movies,4

frase1,HBarnill,"With a better release date, do you think Watchmen would’ve been an Oscar-favorite like Joker was?","I mean, let’s face it: Joker was an objectively bad movie (if you liked the film, cool but please don’t read any further; you’re not gonna like what I have to say about it) yet it got good attention by the Academy for a variety of reasons, namely Joaquin Phoenix’s overdue factor, the fact it wasn’t a “typical comic book movie”, how it seemed way more “important” than it actually was, and Todd Phillips’ ass-kissing campaign. It got way more nominations than it deserved (Costume Design? C’mon!) and those were likely result of those factors, and, I believe, it’s release date.

Watchmen was by no means perfect. Zack Snyder replicated the novel almost perfectly and he still missed the point of it, not dissimilar to what Jon Favereau would do with his crappy Lion King remake. As it stands, it’s still far better than Joker due to the sum of its parts weigh far more than the whole, namely the acting, the visuals, and the few moments when Snyder seemed to get what made the book work. It also got the same critical notices Joker got (both are in the high 60s on RT) and it has some of the same factors Joker had, namely the self-importance and being nothing like a typical superhero movie. If WB released around November, they could’ve capitalized on those factors and campaigned out the ass for it. Also helping matters is how that year, due to the Dark Knight snubbing, the Oscars expanded their Best Picture lineup so nominating Watchmen would’ve easily been a pity nom for them. I can see some other noms, like directing, writing, cinematography, costumes, art direction, sound editing, sound mixing, score, visual effects, editing, makeup, and Supporting Actor (Haley). Does the film deserve that many noms? Not really, but Joker didn’t, either, and it was all thanks to WB’s strategies. 

Anyway, could it have worked? Would Watchmen be just as successful as Joker was on this front?",23,1585507215,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/frase1/with_a_better_release_date_do_you_think_watchmen/,movies,0

I understand he is an influential director who gave iconic films for the world to love.

I hardly see what makes his films special. As a drama director he excels with Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Munich etc. But his family/blockbusters are really lacklustre sometimes especially recently. Asides from Ready Player One, he hasn't made a great family/blockbuster film since Minority Report.

In regards to his earlier films. Jaws is great. I hated Close Encounters. Raiders was great. Temple of Doom was meh. E:T was good. Jurassaic Park was just fine.

fr9iwj,ThEhIsO8730,Prisoners questions,"Watched Prisoners last night and like everyone else, I think the movie was fantastic. But there were a few things that I thought maybe were explained and I just didn't pick it up.

1. Was the ""aunt"" in the camper when they abducted the girls? If Alex abducted them by himself and brought them to the aunt's house - I don't see how the dad could really serve jail time considering that would absolutely make Alex an accomplice to the crime.
2. Were the girls ""snatched"" or were they so infatuated with the camper that they voluntarily got in it while Alex drove them to the aunt's house.
3. Was the purpose of kidnapping children solely about watching their parents lives spin out of control? It had nothing to do with sexual pleasure or a thirst to kill?
4. It seems as though the Aunt and her husband would go back n forth from killing these children to letting them go. Does it ever explain why they were never consistent with that approach? I know they left Alex alive to possibly assist with the kidnappings but why did they let the other guy live and actually leave?
5. How did the aunt's husband die? I know they found him in the basement of the priests house but I couldn't figure out if 1. the priest killed him so he couldn't hurt anyone else or 2. The priest and the man agreed he had to be left down there so he wouldn't hurt anymore children?",1,1585502762,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr9iwj/prisoners_questions/,movies,1

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  **ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE**.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

It did leave me with a question though.,"Did Constantine Nikas perhaps know that the best way of getting his brother (in a phenomenal performance by Benny Safdie I believe) was always to turn himself in and bargain for his brother, and thus the final scene was him finally coming to terms with it....

... Or did the end scene show Connie finally realising that having exhausted all options the only way to get this brother out was taking all the blame on himself so his brother would get clemency?

fr83zs,Lucky-Event,Help identifying large actor or actors in THE IRISHMAN,"(Spoilers for The Irishman)

There is one or two very large mobsters in The Irishman, the actors of whom I am unable to identify.

The first one is in the barber shop whacking scene, he appears to be a bodyguard in some capacity, the walks away, towering over all the civilians, looking cool in the way that very large men do when they wear nice clothes. The scene ends with the tracking shot looking at some flowers as you hear a bunch of gunshots.

The second one is the bathroom at the courthouse, he's in the stall and they even say ""Thanks, Big \[insert name here\]"", but I forget what \[insert name here\] is, and moreover on IMDB there is no character with ""Big"" in their name besides Howard ""Big Ears"" Hunt. Again, he is a very cool looking individual. I suspect this is the same character/actor but I am not certain.

I believe this actor or actors can be seen looming in the background in a few other scenes, looming in the way that very large men loom.

If anyone could help identify this actor or actors, I would appreciate it.",2,1585497713,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr83zs/help_identifying_large_actor_or_actors_in_the/,movies,1

The top 32 films as of 12:00 UTC on Sunday 5th April will progress to the main tournament. The form also has optional sections to predict which film will win the hearts of the unwashed masses.

I am asking for help when it comes to finding the directors cut of Dennis Hoppers film 'Catchfire', also know as 'Backtrack'. I know this was at one point released on vhs as you can see by the link at the bottom of this post. The length of this version is 1:55:30 according to the link making it 20 minutes longer than the original release. Just a warning that amazon have the film listed as backtrack on prime but this doesnt seem to be the directors cut. Being a big fan of Dennis Hopper and knowing this film includes the likes of Joe Pesci, Bob Dylan, Jodi Foster, Vincent Price, Dean Stockwell and other big names, it would be nice to have access to the release, thanks.

fr6spu,roman99789,Help identify these movies from memory fragments,"1) A young man wakes up and kisses a mirror on his nightstand. He was an 80s yuppie I think. TV movie?

2) Two military officers are standing in a building when there's an explosion nearby. Feces falls on them. It was funny. Probably 1960s or 1970s.

3) A large group of overweight boys are running on a track. One is either far ahead or far behind. I remember far ahead. Early 1980s TV movie.

4) A military officer requests a man to commit suicide to spare a ""messy trial"". He gives the man a pistol and a gunshot is heard offscreen.

5) A bulldozer mass buries bodies, I think Holocaust victims.

6) A city with empty streets with air raid sirens. Very old movie I think. It may have been a science fiction movie. It was not The Day After, which had a similar scene.

7) A movie set in the near future that portrayed rich people as virtuous and poor people deserving their fate. There was a stove with bowl shaped burners that eggs were directly cooked in. A girl answers a door and a hoodlum reaches in but the door locks itself slightly open with the guy's arm only getting inside. I'm pretty sure this was a TV movie in the mid-1980s. Exceptionally bad movie.

8) A movie about a motorcycle policeman. He wears glasses. The movie ended with him chasing a van. The van occupants open the back doors and blast the officer off his bike with a shotgun. The credits roll over him sitting on a highway dead. I watched it in the early 1990s but it was older. I thought the name if it was The Thin Blue Line but none of IMDB's entries for that title seem to match.",10,1585492569,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr6spu/help_identify_these_movies_from_memory_fragments/,movies,1

fr5iv2,Jazzlike-Nerve,Actors who hated each other so much that it constantly disrupted filming,"Bill Murray and Lucy Liu allegedly got into a fight that shut down filming for a day on the set of Charlie's Angels.

Channing Tatum and Alex Pettyfer in a Magic Mike. I don't recall Alex promoting the movie, and he was almost non-existent in the film's marketing. Pettyfer has talked about his feud with Channing later on. 

As usual for her later years, Bette Davis hated everyone on the set of ""The Whales of August"" and made everyone's life miserable. However, when she want launch into one of her rants, sweet little old Lillian Gish would just turn her hearing aid off, infuriating Davis all the more. But Davis still managed to score off Gish on the set:

LINDSAY ANDERSON (the director): ""Miss Gish, you've just given us the marvelous close-up!""

BETTE DAVIS: ""She should have! She was around when they invented them!""

Gish did not say one bad word about Davis during the filming until it was all over and she was interviewed for 'People.' They asked her what she thought of the behavior of Davis (who had had a terrible stroke a few years before and had partial facial paralysis for the rest of her life), and Gish replied, ""That face! Have you seen her face? What a tragic face!""

fr4t50,ChrisEvansFan,Emma (2020) is so delightful!,"Jane Austen fans, where you at? 

Initially it looks like the director was greatly influenced by Wes Anderson. But that is not a bad thing. In fact, if any Austen novel can be given the Wes Anderson style it is Emma. It just works. 

Anya Taylor-Joy embodied the character so well. The facial expressions, roll-of-eyes scenes, the kind of look people give if they are exasperated by other people. Emma as a character is very vain, manipulative, privileged and insufferable - but still can be charming if she wants. Anya truly fit this role to a tee. Bill Nighy was amusing as the father and Miranda Hart, even in her small role, was wonderful.

But I think the actor who played Mr Knightley (Johnny Flynn - first time Ive ever saw him in ANYTHING) was the star. I mean at first Im like “This is who they choose as Knightley?!” but as the film goes, he has won my heart. 

Emma has been my favorite Austen lead alongside Anne Elliot from Persuasion. So I welcome all adaptations. The best, in my opinion, is the BBC one with Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller. But this 2020 version is still cute. 

Speaking of Persuasion, I truly hope they adapt this to the big screen and give it like a Pride and Prejudice treatment. Persuasion is so good for the angst and longings. Just put Joe Wright in the director’s seat and you have a formula for success!",10,1585483011,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr4t50/emma_2020_is_so_delightful/,movies,1

fr3qz3,comeuppanceday,Up In The Air (2009) is perfect.,"I just watched it again and I love everything about it. Definitely my favourite Clooney movie; I think his collaboration with director Jason Reitman was brilliant and each artist is completely on point.

I really enjoy films that feature travel/road trips so the fact that its about his life jetsetting across the country and how he thrives on being in transit really hits a note with me.
I like that mostly takes place across middle America, too. The stereotypical settings (NYC, LA etc) just wouldn't have worked, imho.

Clooney's true perfomance value is in the little nuances he so effortlessly delivers (something that I think few actors do as well as he does) throughout the film, where he is often reacting to characters/situations he is confronted with unexpectedly -- such as the changes his work is facing, initial resentment towards his boss (played so well by Jason Bateman) and initial resentment towards Anna Kendrick's character.

The scenes with his siblings are really something,  too.

fr36h4,Astroabs,Surprised By 2019 Movies,"Like everyone, I have had more time on my hands than I am used to so I ended up watching many movies from 2019 that I didn't think I would watch. I was so surprised by how much I love these movies that I wanted to share why I wasn't going to watch them and why they surprised me in case someone out there has the same mindset as me and wasn't planning on watching these masterpieces. 

* Jojo Rabbit

The trailer made me think that the Hitler we saw was the ""real"" Hitler. That seemed a bit *too* silly for me so I was gonna pass. That wasn't the ""real"" Hitler, he is Jojo's imaginary friend (not really a spoiler, you learn this in the first few minutes) and the whole movie was absolutely beautiful with a meaningful plot and lovable characters. 

* Joker

I do NOT like superhero or comicbook movies at all. I think they are all cheesy and awkward. Joker didn't feel like a superhero (or villain) movie at all. This movie didn't have to be about Joker. It could've been about anyone else and I think it would've worked just as well. Also good god Joaquin Phoenix deserved two oscars for that performance. 

* Dark Waters

I thought this would be boring but my blood was boiling the whole time. Hopefully only from frustration and not teflon. 

* Ford V Ferrari

I know nothing about car racing so I didn't even realize these were real people until afterwards. I wasn't interested in this but my boyfriend wanted to watch it so we did and honestly I was painfully invested in the story by the end of it. Also after doing some reading, this movie was very accurate to real life events. 

* Knives Out

The trailers for this movie were so misleading. I wasn't interested in watching another movie use the tired ""who-dun-it"" plot with the last minute twist that ruins half of the movie, creates a plot hole the size of iceland, and destroys all ""rewatchability"". I was flat out wrong. I don't want to say anything else about this movie because the less you know the better. I've watched it twice in 24 hours and it was honestly better the second time.

First off, Heath ledger. This performance feels overlooked to me. It seems that all of the media attention is going to Joaquin Phoenixs joker; while I love his performance, Heath is the definitive joker. Ledgers performance can only be described as Oscar worthy; this is why it’s so upsetting to me that Phoenix got the Oscar instead.

Next off, the continuation of plot lines. As some may recall, in Batman begins, Gary old man gave Batman a card that belonged to the joker. The foresight required to set up the joker in the next movie is honestly admirable. They knew what they wanted to do, and they did it. I’m looking at you last Jedi!

Anyway, basically, this is my favorite movie of the last decade. It’s overlooked nowadays, sadly. That’s why I say, lest we forget, we should appreciate this great work!

Two face is a perfect villain. He has a great arc, and his last scene is terrifying. It is accompanied by hans zimmers fantastic “watch the world burn” which makes it such an intimidating scene.

First off, I’m tired of Joaquin phoenixs joker getting all the media attention. Heath ledgers joker is a lot less famous and popular, but he’s the definitive joker. I don’t know how to describe his performance as anything other than Oscar worthy, which is why it’s so upsetting that Phoenix got the Oscar 

Next off, the continuation of storylines. Let’s not for get the foresight required by Nolan to set up the joker in the first Batman movie (the card Gary old man shows Batman at the end of the movie is jokers card). Remember, this is before the time of the MCU’s rampant post credit scenes.

fr1nko,genkaiX1,Who else had some legitimate criticism of Train To Busan?,"Probably a solid 7/10 for me. The pacing was sometimes god awful in the middle of the film. Scenes were either purposefully stretched out or rushed and it wasn’t because of the story, but the rather the direction itself. Also some of the actions of the characters contradicted themselves throughout. For example, we see MULTIPLE times that characters make an emphasis of closing the doors behind them but the two teenagers conveniently forget this. It’s fine if this happened earlier but not in the final act of the film when these two KNOW, literally KNOW, not to leave doors open.

Also the ending...you’re telling me the father can whoop dozens of zombies ass, literally dozens inside a cramped train but cannot overthrow one worthless zombie pos? That’s inexcusable plot wise and it has no merit whatsoever. The old lady killing everyone just because she didn’t like them is also stupid but at least as some small plot merit. The ending with the father though has none since it’s completely contrived.

There are great things about this move though:

1) Acting
2) Overall plot and it’s themes are fantastic
3) music
4) first act and individual scenes throughout the rest
5) end of the film minus the dumb way the father died",31,1585464854,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr1nko/who_else_had_some_legitimate_criticism_of_train/,movies,1

Vivarium offers the most terrifying, mind breaking, version of hell I could imagine. A version of the Suburbs that traps those visiting it.

fr1b8x,amipregananant,Suggestions For Family-Friendly Movies?,"Hi all!

I'm looking to watch some good family-friendly movies with the parents and siblings during this extended period of being home. We're all adults, so I'm not necessarily looking for Pixar/Disney movies (although good ones like Up, Inside Out, etc. are always welcomed), but more so feel-good movies that aren't too heavy. We just watched Knives Out, and everyone loved it, and my mom asked me to play more movies like it (not so much a whodunit, but a movie that's comedic, has a good plot, good ending, etc.). Other movies that my parents really liked, if it helps, were Captain Philips, Forrest Gump, Sully (I guess they like Tom Hanks, lol), Hidden Figures, Inside Out, The Pursuit of Happyness, among others. 

Google proved not very helpful, so I turn to the good people of Reddit for some advice. Any recommendations are helpful and welcomed!",51,1585463085,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr1b8x/suggestions_for_familyfriendly_movies/,movies,1

And even then, people get suckered into rallying for them because they provide jobs.........just in exchange for your health and well being. 

Guys like Rob Billot are heroes. They take the crap of being the first through the wall but they still press on.

fr09s6,ButterSock123,Saw Pan's Labyrinth for the first time.,"There wasn't any real reason I hadn't seen this movie, so I decided to give it a shot. 

My only real problem with it was that Ofelia never asked the Faun questions, she just rolled with it. (Upon the film ending I realized this was on purpose to make a point, but until then, it bugged me).

I really thought the Pale Man would have a speaking role, but it didnt ruin the film that he didnt. Del Toro said he thought of the Pale Man as the Catholic Church, and they've been silent on a lot of stuff.

Not a movie I'm gonna need to revisit time after time. But it was a good one.",10,1585458094,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fr09s6/saw_pans_labyrinth_for_the_first_time/,movies,1

fqzsch,MichiganSummerSnow,The Planet of the Apes trilogy has the best visual effects of the past decade and should be recognized by more people,"One think I love about this trilogy, aside from its acting and character growth, is that its visuals improve with each film. The first film slightly looks like a video game (which makes sense because it came out nearly 10 years ago) yet its sequels are honestly so realistic that I'd forget that I'm seeing humans onscreen. Everything from the facial features to the movements to the expressions of the apes have so much detail crafted into them that it's breathtaking to see. It's sad that they didn't win they Academy Award for best effects, and I feel like this trilogy could be referred to as being DiCaprioed or Deakined (it lost to Hugo, Interstellar, and BR2049, so it's a fair play for all of them).",60,1585455915,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqzsch/the_planet_of_the_apes_trilogy_has_the_best/,movies,1

But what completely blew me away was the camera work.  I felt I was watching a movie about surfing that was made by people who really love and understand the sport.  The action shots of the athletes were amazing.  I'm guessing they used sophisticated underwater cameras to capture the surfers as they went from riding the wave to falling into the surf at the end of the run.  A very interesting visual device - off in the distance from where the surfers were catching their waves were the oil drilling rigs where these young athletes would probably end up working when they put down their boards.

fqyf9w,NerdyHipster87,Almost Famous: Where is the love?,"So, Almost Famous had always been at the top of my watch list, but I never got around to it. I’m a musician, a music junkie and I especially love music from the 60s and 70s. Combine that with my love of Zooey Deschanel, Billy Crudup and my desire to see Kate Hudson actually show off her acting skills.  For real though, I’ve always thought she was a horrendous actor, and I wanted to see what’s supposedly her best role. 

So, tonight I finally got around to it, and it gave me all the feels. Everything about this movie hit me. The feeling of not belonging, wanting to find your “family”, your “home”. Wanting to be special, falling in love, the soundtrack, the cast, the cameos (Jay Baruchel FTW), the story. Is this movie considered a classic, because it should be.  I never hear people talk about this film among the greats. I don’t understand why. 

Maybe it’s my obsession for all things coming of age and finding love (32M still looking for “the one”), but I really connected with this film on many levels, and I may have shed a tear at one point. Ugh, I can’t wait to watch this movie again. 

I can’t even say what my favorite parts are because the whole movie was. I totally was William when he confessed his love for Penny. We’ve all had that feeling of loving someone who at the time is seeing/into someone else. 

Sorry for the rant, but I freaking loved this movie. Can’t wait for everyone’s comments!",0,1585450263,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqyf9w/almost_famous_where_is_the_love/,movies,1

All this set me up to think this would be a good movie.  It's not.

The movie opens with the main character sneaking out of bed.  She's in a huge, obviously expensive house and she's clearly afraid of the guy she's in bed with.  I'm hooked.  She's sneaking through the house, collecting her things, trying not to wake her boyfriend (whom we're later informed is abusive).  It's a tense, well-done scene.  And it's got just a bit of heartbreak when she tries to comfort the dog as she tells him that she can't bring him with her.  Then, she climbs over a wall.

Why is she climbing over a wall instead of running down the driveway and out the gate?  I don't know.  But I suppose it makes for a more dramatic scene.  Ok.  I can let that go.

Then, two weeks later, our heroine is living with some dude and his daughter, not the sister who drove out to the middle of bum-fuck nowhere to pick her up in the middle of the night and rescue her from her abusive boyfriend.  But he's a muscular, imposing yet gentle and caring guy who we later find out is a cop.  That makes sense.  

While living with this cop and recovering from her trauma, our heroine finds out that her abuser killed himself and she and her sister (a lawyer, I guess) go to the reading of the will, read by the abuser's brother, also a lawyer.  Our heroine is bequeathed an ass-load of cash and a big point is made of the fact that the abusers ashes are sitting in an urn across the room.

Now, we all know where the movie is supposed to go from here.  He's not really dead.  He's the invisible man and he's going to terrorize her for the rest of the film.  This would be a good point to show irrefutable proof that he's dead, or at least irrefutable as movies go.  The pictures of is body that show up later in the film are what I'm thinking of, but I suppose it would be rather convoluted to show them at this point.

Anyway, up to this point, I'm actually enjoying this movie.  It's giving me tickles of nostalgia for all the 90s thrillers I remember.  I never saw it, but I'm reminded of Sleeping with the Enemy for it's similar themes and such.  It's not a perfect movie, but I'm rooting for it.

The invisible man sends a nasty email to the heroine's sister from the heroine's email account around about the time that he really starts laying in on the heroine, making her feel paranoid and causing people around her to start questioning her sanity.  Naturally, the sister is pissed at the heroine and not taking any of her shit.  In the scene where the two have this confrontation, it seems to me that the sister is a little too dismissive.  The writing seems to be relying on the characters not bothering to give one another the benefit of the doubt in the way most reasonable people would.  

Some shit happens.

Eventually, our heroine goes back to her abuser's house to investigate.  It's deserted.  All the furniture is covered in plastic.  It's creepy.  She discovers his invisibility suit.

And for some reason, the fucking dog is still there.

His will has been read.  His house is all but put on the market and sold.  And the fucking dog is still there.

Ok.  At this point, I'm a little annoyed.  The dog being there requires explanation, because it's out of the ordinary.  If someone is believed to be dead, their dog isn't going to be left in their house like all their furniture.  It's clear that the dog is only there for a cheap moment of suspense when it barks at something and runs up some stairs.

Next, we're at a big, fancy restaurant with the heroine and her sister.  She's convinced her sister to meet her there so she can explain what's going on and ask for help.  When the waiter comes to ask what they'd like to drink the sister is a complete bitch to the guy, because when you're having a fight with your sibling, naturally, you take it out on the waiter, right?  Right when it seems like our heroine might be getting her sister back on her side, the camera cuts from the heroine's face to the sister's and we see a chef's knife floating in mid-air.  That's strange.  How did an invisible man manage to carry a knife through a restaurant without anyone noticing a floating knife?  Did he hide it behind his invisible back?  Did he put on a jacket and hide it beneath the jacket?  Did he drape a towel over his arm and hide it under the floating towel?  Well, anyway, the invisible man slashes the sister's throat and slaps the knife into our heroine's hand, framing her for the murder.

I almost forgot: There's a scene where she calls the invisible man's cell phone and hears it going off in the attic of her friend's house.  She goes up there to find it, hears him climbing the ladder after her, and throws a bucket of paint on him.  Genius!  Resourceful!  I'm into it.  Except for the fact that her friend apparently keeps open buckets of paint in the attic.  But then, she follows the trail of paint through the house, which dwindles to a few drops absurdly quickly and finds the kitchen sink covered in paint with the tap running.  Then, the invisible man assaults her, because he was somehow able to rinse off a bucketful of paint in mere seconds without leaving puddles of water on the floor to track his steps and even more dripping from his body.  

Anyway, blah, blah, blah... There's a stupid twist and the movie ends with our heroine somehow managing to excuse herself to the bathroom while having dinner with her abuser, change out of her dress and ditch the wire that her cop friend is listening to for a confession, don the invisibility suit, overpower a guy who up this point has shown near-superhuman strength, kill him, get back to the bathroom and change clothes, all within a reasonable enough amount of time that nobody (not even the guy listening on the wire) suspects anything.

None of this would be so bad if the movie didn't have an obvious theme of gaslighting versus believing victims.  If you're going to treat such a delicate subject in a movie, it deserves better craftsmanship than this garbage.",7,1585450214,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqyeso/if_the_invisible_man_is_setting_the_standard_for/,movies,1

fqy39f,notdevnotops,Tip of my tongue: Psychological Thriller,"It's been bugging me for at least two years. Watched a movie, either on Netflix or Prime, and I cannot, after a ton of google searches, find out the title.   
I know I didn't make all this up because my girlfriend remembers watching it too... 

Here's the plot summary as best I can remember:

The movie follows a guy that seems kind of like a loner guy, he has a job (but I seem to remember that the manager didn't like him, thought he was too spaced out, etc) I think the job was like an assembly line or food packaging or something (no, not the Machinist). I believe the plot is also set up that the guy had some sort of mental disorder (like autistic or something, maybe even shizo, taking meds/recovering - something like that). One detail I remember is I think the character lived in a trailer. Like a small one. 

Anyways, after setting up his character, the movie turns to kind of like a typical thriller he starts to see creatures and zombie-like things out to get him, etc. He doesn't know if it's in his mind or it's real. 

He ends up losing a grip and loses his job/etc. The twist at the end reveals that the whole thing (job, stress, monsters, etc) is all in a coma dream. He ends up getting the message from his family (by his bedside in the real world to wake up) and the very end is like tension with the family telling him to wake up but you don't know if he actually opens his eyes or not, the movie cuts right at the very end. Leaving the viewer to decide if he was able to wake up or not.   


Anyways, I remember liking it, and wanted to know what the heck it was, and I am completely unable to find anything. Reaching out here just in case.",5,1585448932,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqy39f/tip_of_my_tongue_psychological_thriller/,movies,1

fqviks,mranimal2,Movies that made you realize how movies have changed,"Zootopia made me realize it doesn't really matter whether a movie is part of the billion dollar club anymore

Before, it was only the movies that were pop culture phenomenons that made a billion dollars. Then, in the 2010's, occasionally a movie that was an actual pop culture phenomenon (like Frozen) would make a billion dollars but now it's mostly franchises, mainly made by Disney, that come and go from the public eye.

And when Zootopia not only got a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes but had the highest-grossing opening weekend (at that point) for an animated Disney movie, I thought it was going to be a pop culture phenomenon like Frozen, The Lion King, or even Finding Nemo.

But, while it was well-received by audiences and has an extremely vocal fanbase to put it lightly, that never really happened, as far as the United States is concerned (as I heard it was huge in Asia). But here hardly anyone I knew talked about the movie. And, if they did, I was the one to bring it up more often than not. Once it grossed a billion dollars, though, I thought it was going to gain popularity but, no, it didn't. It was just received as another ""good animated Disney/Pixar movie"", it didn't really stick out from the pack.

And that made me realize that it doesn't really matter if a movie makes a billion dollars anymore. You don't even need to be part of a franchise anymore, as Zootopia wasn't really except for animated Disney movies. Now it's normal for a movie to make a billion dollars, as Zootopia proved.",53,1585439325,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqviks/movies_that_made_you_realize_how_movies_have/,movies,1

fqvfq6,Lightzout21,Help identifying movie,"So I am going to try as hard as I can here to give as much detail about this movie as I can, but I haven't seen it in over 6 years so some details about the setting/plot may be off.

It was very similar to Shutter Island (which I just watched because I thought this was it, but it wasn't), where some guy is at a mental hospital or something and becomes convinced that he is crazy by the doctors there. He eventually gives in and accepts the fact that he is indeed crazy until the end of the movie where he sees something that makes him realize he isn't crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I think he sees a piece of clothing or something on the top of a chain link fence. This clothing (I think?) is proof that he is not crazy because he remembers wearing it before he came to the mental hospital. 

The details might be a tad off, but the idea is that the doctors convince him that he is crazy and he has been there for a long time, he finally accepts it, then he sees something that is proof that he is in fact not crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could give more detail on this but that is all I really remember, I am hoping you movie buffs could help me identify this movie. Thanks a ton!!",2,1585439031,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqvfq6/help_identifying_movie/,movies,0

fqtj8e,AlwaysAdam569,What is a character that you feel sorry for?,"Title says it all. What character do you feel most sorry for?

Personally, I would say that I feel really bad for Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin from Final Destination 3, followed by Wendy Christensen (from the same movie too!). Wendy's story is just plain SAD. She &gt;!lost her boyfriend in a freak accident and starts losing her sanity when her friends start to die. Ian even tries to kill her when she didn't even do anything wrong. She is constantly in a state of depression for damn near the entire movie, and ends up being just another victim of Death (while it is never revealed if they died or not, producer Craig Perry said that they likely died).!&lt; And while I do feel really bad for her, I feel just as bad for Ashley and Ashlyn as I do for Wendy. They only appear in a few scenes, but &gt;!they die a horrific and brutal death in a tanning bed. They don't get a short and sweet death, either: they slowly have their faces melt off as they desperately try to free themselves from their tanning beds. Granted, that was mostly their fault, as they left a slurpee next to the f*cking power supply of all things, and they ended up locking the owner out of the room they were in, meaning that he couldn't help them escape. And they also seem to be nice: they were going to invite Wendy to the Phoenix tanning salon (yet another reason they died was because Wendy didn't go. Horrible luck), and Ian mentions that they didn't even do anything bad to anyone.!&lt; They also have Frankie Cheeks stalking them like the creep he is. &gt;!Seriously, I can't imagine the pain they went through when they slowly burned alive in a horrific fashion. I wouldn't even want to see that kind of pain happen to my worst enemies.!&lt;

Other characters I feel bad for: &gt;!Jim Hawkins from Treasure Planet, Dumbo, Chewbacca, Bambi, and Hiro Hamada.!&lt;",40,1585432651,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqtj8e/what_is_a_character_that_you_feel_sorry_for/,movies,1

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  **ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE**.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

If for some reason you have to choose one movie that people regard as “terrible,” what would you choose? Maybe in the comments choose why you would choose that.

Twilight- High-school student Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), always a bit of a misfit, doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate.

CATS- A tribe of cats must decide yearly which one will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.

Fifty Shades of Grey- DescriptionWhen college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of *PAIN* and pleasure. 

Death Note LIVE ACTION- Guy finds notebook that when you write a name down, that person dies.

Dragon Ball Evolution- The young warrior Son Goku sets out on a quest, racing against time and the vengeful King Piccolo, to collect a set of seven magical orbs that will grant their wielder unlimited power.

Catwoman- ""Catwoman"" is the story of shy, sensitive artist Patience Philips (Halle Berry), a woman who can't seem to stop apologizing for her own existence. She works as a graphic designer for Hedare Beauty, a mammoth cosmetics company on the verge of releasing a revolutionary anti-aging product. When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy. What happens next changes Patience forever.

Idk maybe when I was 19 when I saw it in theaters I was more worried about texting and looking at my phone instead of watching the movie. Now I’m 27 and I just finished it for the first “full” watch of the film.

fqsbzv,DaKiddovol1,Best movie death?,"I just watched The Land before time (most underrated childrens film ever), and the death of Little foots mother broke me. The whole dinosaur ecosystem is collapsing, and his world is getting turned upside down. Now more than ever he needs his foundation, but his mother dies while trying to protect him, and he has to go out in this whole new world alone. I shed some tears man.

There are defiently others too

Roy Battys death, and for me, almost rebirth. The way it is accompanied with this beautiful poetic Tears in the rain monologue. It is so powerful. Please watch The Danish National Symphony Orchestras performance of some of the music from [Blade Runner](https://youtu.be/hMd5_DcLNdE) . I really think, that the fact they include the monologue shows, how much of a universe it has created for itself. 

Bills death in Kill Bill. The relationship between Beatrix and Bill is mildly said, very complicated. It's back and forth in how they talk to each other. Beatrix' uses the five-point-palm-exploding-heart technique, and Bill asks her, why she never shared that with him, and Beatrix says 'cause she's a bad person. After this moment of sincerity from Beatrix, which it seems, that Bill has been waiting for, they both lay down their guards. It's beautiful to watch these last exchanges between them, which are filled with love and humour. A Perfect ending in my opinion. The acting on both parts is masterful. 

HAL 9000s death/deactivation...I don't Know, what to say about this in short sentences. It's impossible to describe the intensity and the weirded out feeling of witnessing his deconstruction. It's..kinda Beautiful. Like you go through these different layers of his consciousness. It's almost like HAL becomes human like in his final moments of despair, which almost makes it seem like Dave is doing a malevolent act.

First, I have never been so scared by an ending. My roommate had to come check on me after yelling so loudly.

As for the rest of the film: Holy crap I don't know what I just watched. It was so unsettling yet strangely hypnotic. For how ""slow"" the film is, I found myself engaged the whole time. Yet I still don't know what happened.

The film is intentionally vague, and I find myself at a complete loss of how to interpret it. I do not think I have seen a film that so blatantly leaves so much to the viewer. (Am trying too hard with this one? Or have I not seen enough other movies?)

Preliminary google searches suggest that it is commentary on totalitarianism and the nature of the human subconscious. But I am just sitting in shock trying to connect all the dots.

Instead of being drained of or overwhelmed by emotion, I was drained of energy and overwhelmed with tiredness.

I am always in awe of how many dark and edgy (not trying to sound like an emo teen but I’m lacking other words) roles he takes on. Really surprised he’s never won an Oscar, not even sure if he’s been nominated.

It was incredible, great visuals and sounds, as well as the acting of the whole cast. What stuck as the most brilliant part of the film was how very grounded the movie was. There is no plot point i can notice, only a story that very much flowed like a sort of a poem. 

The actions of the characters, the mirror images of the openning scene and last scene was amazing. The ending, more precise, was not that of game of thrones type of surprise character death or something, it was something that the audience kind of expects to see coming and is very cathartic in feeling. It is earned, not just simply shoved down our throats or such.

Uncut gems is a wonderful dive into the self destruction of a man who sprirals all the way till his end. i would recommen people to try to see it.",8,1585426784,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqrokc/uncut_gems_is_the_most_perfectly_constructed_film/,movies,0

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  **ALL REGIONS ARE NOW ACTIVE**.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.  Everybody stay safe out there!",1,1585426116,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqrgu8/2019_best_movies_march_madness_style/,movies,1

fqqmhv,somehipster,"What are your top three ""mental health"" movies?","Obviously these times are tough on everyone's mental state. I'd love to get some recommendations for movies to help me clear up my head space. Whatever it is, if it works for you I want to hear it.

Here are my top three:

1) The Big Lebowski. Typical Redditor response I know, this movie is like an old comfy couch, I can just sink into it at any point. But more than that, the message in the movie just helps put me at ease. You watch people experience horrible things and struggle to deal with forces out of their control and so, on it's surface, the movie has a very nihilistic and depressing outlook. But you also watch people repeatedly help one another, commiserate, come together, and just go about their lives and find joy anyway. It reminds me that everything doesn't have to be perfect to be happy.

2) Clerks 2. Following on that theme, a lot of my mental anguish comes from money. I'm always worried about it. I come from poverty growing up so I focus a lot on my career and acquiring wealth. Right now, no one knows if they'll get back to point they were at before this happened. Either way, this movie helps with that. It's funny, it's kind hearted, it has a bitching 90's alt soundtrack. It reminds me I don't have to be rich to survive or to have a fulfilling life.

3) In Bruges. Rounding out #3 is a dark comedy. Sense a theme? Everything about it just sucks me in - the writing, the absurdity, the sadness. It's dark and unforgiving and I like the horrible honesty that it has. But there's also a story of redemption. We all regret actions we take from time to time. We all punish ourselves because we feel we deserve it. Retribution may have its place, but so does Salvation. Especially now when I may end up having to make hard decisions. It reminds me to forgive myself.

So what are yours?",171,1585423433,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqqmhv/what_are_your_top_three_mental_health_movies/,movies,9
fqqmex,Mozzielium,Cat In The Hat (2004) is the single greatest artistic achievement in modern art,"Mike Myers stars as the titular Cat in this groundbreaking psychological horror. The story mixes both a sense of humor and undeniable dread, having intense psychosexual themes similar to ALIEN (1979) and Hellraiser (1987). The deep and complex narrative of two kids being tormented by an omnipotent and cruel sadist cat-man is truly harrowing, and the twist ending is up there with some of the horror greats. Only a genius such as Bo Welch could combine such intense and introspective themes into a film that feels both grounded and surreal.

fqph0z,tivep,[SPOILER] About that ending of The Platform,"I thought The Platform on Netflix was amazing, but in the end it suddenly became far too open-ended. Some people are calling it lazy, others seem to love the metaphor it portrayed. 

1) The general thought is that that little girl is Miharu's daughter and somehow she's being kept alive, hidden and healthy in that prison. Either that on the Administration has some diabolical plan by purposely placing here there in floor 333 to see if anyone was willing to descend all the way down.

I found that the ending makes more sense it it were not literal as mentioned here - [The Platform Ending Explained](https://www.thisisbarry.com/film/the-platform-movie-ending-explained-2019-netflix-film/)

2) Goreng dies trying to save Miharu and his descent is all part of his dying thoughts where he makes up the child in his head as his salvation.

3) The entire movie is basically purgatory and the story is one of Goreng's atonement.

I liked 2, even though 3 explains the Wheelchair guy better, I mean, how has he been surviving?

fqpfio,mistermeowgi11,What’s your favorite bit of coincidental movie trivia?,"My personal favorite: Bertram, a character in The Sandlot, is said to, at the end of the movie, have gotten really into the ‘60s and no one ever heard from him again. Grant Gelt, the actor who portrayed Bertram, last appeared as an actor in a 1999 TV miniseries called, you guessed it, the ‘60s.

That’s it, you can share this at your cocktail parties now.",107,1585419601,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqpfio/whats_your_favorite_bit_of_coincidental_movie/,movies,5

fqok5z,StormFalcon32,"In ""Sicario"", why does the team raid the tunnel?","Some minor spoilers ahead if you haven't watched  


Towards the end, delta force and CIA raid the secret tunnel between arizona and mexico which the sonora cartel has been using to secretly move drugs into the US. Their plan is to find and kill the head of the cartel by following his second in command Manuel, who has been called back due to the recent chaos caused by the CIA.  


There's 2 main reasons why this confuses me.

&amp;#x200B;

1. They already have a satellite tracking Manuel's car, why couldn't Alejandro have hijacked his car before he crossed the border or followed him over the border normally? What's the point of going through the tunnel?  

2. Matt and delta force seem to say that the tunnel raid is just ""making noise"" and causing a distraction, but I'm not sure why they need to make noise if Manuel has already been called back. Why does only Alejandro go through the tunnel while everyone else just goes back?",8,1585416867,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqok5z/in_sicario_why_does_the_team_raid_the_tunnel/,movies,0

fqoj6q,CerebralHawk,The Social Network (2010) vs Steve Jobs (2015),"I knew that both [*The Social Network* \(2010\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016) (TSN) and [*Steve Jobs* \(2015\)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2080374) (SJ) were written by Aaron Sorkin, whose writing I was a fan of from *The Newsroom* and *The West Wing*, TV series about an ideal news agency and an ideal president, respectively. Though I like Apple more than Facebook, it was Sorkin's writing, not my interest in technology, that put my butt in the seat watching both movies. However, today I learned that while David Fincher directed TSN (which I did know), he was originally attached to direct SJ as well (which I did not know — Danny Boyle ended up directing).

I wasn't a big fan of TSN, rating it a mediocre 6/10. I tend to rate high, so for me, a 6 means it was watchable but I will likely never watch it again. On a flat scale it's more like a solid 4.5 or a generous 5. I was not excited and barely stayed interested with TSN, though the writing was decent (I felt a bit let down overall) and Jesse Eisenberg's Mark Zuckerberg was an overly despicable, punchable character (which I suppose is the idea).

SJ also featured an unlikable main character. People seem to either love or hate Steve Jobs (the man, not the movie, which I'm abbreviating — if I don't, I'm talking about the man), or they don't know very much about him, and the same is true about Apple, the company he co-founded. Also, while Eisenberg looks a lot like Zuck, Michael Fassbender didn't look a whole lot like Steve Jobs.

That said, I found the writing in SJ to be as good as anything in *The West Wing* and the heated debate with John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) over Jobs' dismissal from Apple to be among the best of *The Newsroom*'s writing, and overall gave the film a 9/10, and I often think about whether that rating is high enough. The writing is amazing. Fassbender not looking like Jobs bothers me, though, and is probably the worst thing about this movie. Some of his interactions are not as good as the others — specifically, some of the later interactions with Andy Hertzfeld and the reporter, whose name I can't remember. But, all of Jobs' interactions with Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogen, in an uncharacteristically serious role), John Sculley, and above all, his daughter Lisa, had my full attention, even on my third and fourth viewings. The visuals, from the rocket launch projected onto the hallway walls when Jobs is telling Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) about NASA's Skylab, to the quick, dramatic shots of the central Jobs/Sculley debate, are stunning to say the least.

On IMDb, TSN is rated higher at 7.7/10 vs SJ's 7.2, and TSN gets recommended more. There tends to be a backlash against anything Apple, outside of dedicated Apple communities, on the Internet, which I'm sure affected the rating to a non-zero extent, and while Facebook is also facing a backlash now over privacy, the anti-Facebook sentiment has only been gaining steam relatively recently, and TSN is now a decade old. Plus, film buffs love David Fincher, and for good reason. However, I couldn't find anything special there.

If you've seen both, what are your thoughts (and ratings) on each? How do you think they compare, and do you think you have a bias with regards to the technology and/or the companies the movies are about?",32,1585416789,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqoj6q/the_social_network_2010_vs_steve_jobs_2015/,movies,4

This movie is a masterpiece.,"I had always heard good things about the 2015 film *Ex Machina*, but somehow I never got around to it. However, I watched it for the first time today, and I can safely say that it's brilliant.

Everything about this movie is great, from the lush cinematography, to the ambient score, to the set design of the house, to the themes about humanity, personality, and free will. There's plenty of great scenes, including all the Turing tests and the dancing scene. And all the performances are great too, particularly Alicia Vikander as the android Ava, who has become one of my favorite movie characters of the past decade.

This is an impressive directorial debut for Alex Garland, and I can't wait to check out whatever he does next. Maybe someday, I'll also check out *Annihilation* or *Devs.*",215,1585416544,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqogd6/i_cant_believe_i_havent_seen_ex_machina_until/,movies,12

fqo7kk,matias7anriquez,"Just finished ""I lost my body"", by Jérémy Clapin. Here are my two cents:","I really liked the film, it took a while to get on board with the plot, but once you go past the logic of it all you can really submerge on its poetry. I believe the severed hand to be the main symbol of the film, representing how we latch on to things, how we hold on to feelings, and emotions, sometimes we grab on them so hard that is really difficult to let them loose. So the hand being ripped apart was an abrupt way to let it all go, let the past go. The wounds from the past, the ghost that we carry with us. Even if they came chasing after us, we need to take that leap of faith and reach the other side. Sadness, loneliness, when we live with them for so long they became familiar, they become home, we get used to them, the pain can be comforting. But getting to the other side of this feelings can be unknown territory, it's new, it's a new fate. A new life we didn't know how could feel, so it's scary, but once you're there a whole new path appears, and you can breath again, you can take a deep breath and smile at the new road ahead.

And one more thing, maybe I'm dead wrong, but I believe Naoufel recorded his jump over his parents death, and if that's true, that's a very beautiful way to show how we can alter things, we can rewrite our story, that power is in our ""hands"".

fqo1ow,canissilvestris,The Similarities Between Atlantis: Lost Empire and Avatar,"So I just finished watching Atlantis for the first time (wonderful movie) and it struck me how similar the movie Avatar (the blue people one) is to it! You have a group of adventurer/scientist/military people traveling to an unknown world, each with their own agenda. Upon arrival, they discover people who are fans of the color blue who are very in touch with nature and the life force that is around them. One young man in particular with good intentions is enamored by their culture and the princess and wants to help, eventually going against the wishes of the militaristic general type man who is in charge of the expedition. This leads to a fight, with the young man and those supporting him teaming up with the natives to overthrow the military man and his forces. Afterwards, the young man stays behind to join the natives and be a part of the culture, complete with blue coloring. I know pocahontas is the typical story associated with avatar but I've never heard anyone associate these two movies so I wanted to see what you guys thought.

In my opinion, that is. Even grittier and more technically correct than Matrix (though not nearly as great overall). More genuine and focused on its Sci-Fi elements than anything Ridley Scott has tried. It has the unmistakable feel of an actual snapshot of the time period. No other filmmaker that I know of adhered so completely to authenticity like Nolan did by having the characters not use boring contractions in the language.

Everything about this film screamed authentic Sci-Fi. The climactic scene was up there with the best in all of the genre's history, in my opinion.

The film was so well done, such an improvement over the flawed Sci-Fi movies, that I didn't even mind the normally grating Leo DeCaprio, lol!",26,1585414090,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqnp9f/inception_2010_stands_as_one_of_the_greatest/,movies,2
fqnoxb,Jazzlike-Nerve,Batman Returns might be the best Batman movie ever made (and sadly few will agree),"Just watched it on Netflix for the first time in at least 5 years and realizing that it really is a brilliant film.

I know a lot of people prefer the first film with Jack Nicholson or Batman movies with Psycho Bale, but I found the first a bit boring and the Bale films dragging in some parts. Returns was a real ride. Even today with comic book movies that seem glossed over (Suicide Squad), one-dimensional (Avengers) or even downright lame (Spider Man: Far from Home), this film really stands out.

I love the ""dark"" elements of it. And Michelle Phieffer's brilliant interpretation of ""Catwoman"" which is still till this day the best Batman movie character. I loved how the movie nailed the Batman/Catwoman relationship perfectly. I like it when movies made for the masses have a little depth and nuance instead of just opting for the standard ""Me good, you bad"" aspect of most comic book movies.",20,1585414059,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqnoxb/batman_returns_might_be_the_best_batman_movie/,movies,4

Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  I'll post a new region every day.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

There was so much blood in that movie and some scenes I remember were in black and white but I once saw a scene of the same movie in color where they try to escape by going into a car (probably in the killer's garage) they were trying to start the car but I think it didn't work.

fqmz4f,SirRingoStarr,Looking for a movie about a man held captive in a silo and a prison. Also helps a guard by writing love letters (A lot more details below),"1. I remember we follow a guy who both stays in a regular prison but also in a corn silo of some sort. 

2. The main guy helps a guard make a love letter or something

3. He helps the guard make a love letter in place that is neither a regular prison or the silo. But some other sort of place where he and others are held captive


I remember the ending when him and a bunch of other people are walking on a road looking for their families who are holding up signs with their family name on. But I am pretty sure he couldn't find his family anywhere. 

So main guy is held captive in a silo at some point. Helps a guard find love by writing love letters for him in his cell. Main guy is also held captive more than 3 different places. In the ending him and others are released tries to find their family in the massive crowed formed. 

I think the movie is about some war going on. Not an old movie (made after the 2000s).

Fantasy Island could easy exist as a very high quality HBO or Netflix series run just like west world and the rest. The concept of being able to experience something usually unobtainable, or undo a regret...is rich with deep story telling opportunity. Instead they went with some drive in slasher crap. Man, I’m so mad. I just hope it doesn’t damage the image so much that it can never be attempted again.

IMDb has not been able to help me out, as I obviously don’t know their real names, and their pictures don’t appear in the cast list. :)

One a side note:

1) Imagine Christopher Nolan had made this movie

2) R.I.P. Richard Hatch. Kinda sad that he didn’t get any better roles.

3) Chloe Dykstra seems talented. Let’s hope this oeuvre didn’t crush her blossoming career.

4) At one point during the story, Cello sabotages the casting of a superhero movie to participate in a B movie in which the director wants to see her in a white bathtub covered in blood.

fqkmyu,BobDylanBlues,Killing Them Softly (2012) feels Wildly Appropriate for 2020.,"I’ve been rewatching this movie all week and I can’t help but feel like the movie is better suited to 2020 than it was to 2012. The movie was filmed in post-Katrina New Orleans and is about some small time hoodlums who rob a mob-run card game and are then targeted by hitmen who are given directives by older white men who may or may not have political connections. 

To quote the director Andrew Dominik “it was the story of an economic crisis, and it was an economic crisis in an economy that was funded by gambling—and the crisis occurred due to a failure in regulation.”

The movie deals with economic collapse in a time of crisis, politics and the divisiveness of politics during an election year, corruption, and to a lesser extent it deals with race in America, and a failing healthcare system. At first glance this is a movie about some criminals and mobsters doing what they do best, but behind it all it seems to be an indictment of the nature of America as a country that is run more like a business than a county, where the working class are underpaid, undervalued, and have no real hope for a future.",40,1585403854,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqkmyu/killing_them_softly_2012_feels_wildly_appropriate/,movies,1

fqjj1j,PhiladelphiaFatAss,True Grit (2010) Stands As One Of The Greatest Westerns Of The Modern Era.,"In my opinion, that is. Even grittier and more period correct than Unforgiven (though not nearly as great overall). More genuine and focused on its Western elements than anything Tarantino has tried. It has the unmistakable feel of an actual snapshot of the time period. No other filmmaker that I know of adhered so completely to authenticity like the Cohen's did by having the characters not use modern contractions in the language (will not in place of won't, for example).

Everything about this film screamed authentic Western. His climactic shootout scene was up there with the best in all of the genre's history, in my opinion.

With my top five being Wag the Dog, Birdman, Get Out, Natural Born Killers and Fight Club, I was wondering which ones yours might be. That said if you're into satire and satire movies.

Also, since it's impossible for me to have seen all of them, I'd love ypur suggestions and recommendations on satire movies. 

Please bear in mind that I'm really talking about true satire that criticizes. Not funny movies with satirical single scenes or comedy movies.",78,1585399389,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqji3y/satire_movies_whats_your_favorite_and_do_you_habe/,movies,1
fqjg8i,PhiladelphiaFatAss,"Not Underrated, Or Underappreciated; True Grit (2010) Stands As One Of The Greatest Westerns Of The Modern Era.","In my opinion, that is. Even grittier and more period correct than Unforgiven (though not nearly as great overall). More genuine and focused on its Western elements than anything Tarantino has tried. It has the unmistakable feel of an actual snapshot of the time period. No other filmmaker that I know of adhered so completely to authenticity like the Cohen's did by having the characters not use modern contractions in the language (will not in place of won't, for example). 

Everything about this film screamed authentic Western. His climactic shootout scene was up there with the best in all of the genre's history, in my opinion. 

The film was so well done, such an improvement over the flawed original, that I didn't even mind the normally grating Matt Damon, lol!",1,1585399184,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqjg8i/not_underrated_or_underappreciated_true_grit_2010/,movies,1

fqiwm4,sammyjamez,Have you ever noticed that some cheesy films from the 80s and 90s can be very deep and self-aware of you look close enough?,"In the wake of what is going on, I went into some of the cheesy films of the 80s and 90s to pass the time and little did I realise that some of these films which are meant to be cheesy, action-packed thriller stories, can actually be quite self-aware and involve a lot of deep themes if you look closely.

&amp;#x200B;

On the films that I noticed was Demolition Man - it is over the top and overly unrealistic yet for some reason, it feels very familiar because there is still sort of division between the two worlds - between extreme order and extreme freedom and the blurry line between the two.

&amp;#x200B;

The second one was Robocop - the murky blends between man and the machine and it would level should this jump the line between good police work and police brutality, or when the man becomes a machine, the machine is being hunted down by its own people as though for some reason, the people who invented these creations (like from the story of Dr. Frankenstein) eventually fear their creations because they will out beat their creators; or at what level has the man in the machine became more of an actual machine than a man with a soul?

&amp;#x200B;

And other films - 

&amp;#x200B;

Dead Hard - the ineptness of the major corporations including the police yet they still get credit in the end or things get back to normal and nothing is really changed or adapted to the situation that is at hand.

&amp;#x200B;

Mad Max - A person who is possibly as insane as the rest of the world that he is living in but for some reason, he is the more sane one in this insane world, personally reflecting how living and struggling to survive in the real world can be an insane task and breaking that cycle may be the sanest part of it all with the risk of appearing as the insane person in the eyes of others

&amp;#x200B;

Total Recall - Is the person still in the dream or not or was it all a dream in the end? Or at what level should one achieve their desires be considered as escaping reality or reaching to the reality that you wish to achieve? And what level should one's desires or dreams be worth it in the end even if some of those desires may involve some risks or change in your schedule or even your identity?

when i look at Anton Chigurh, i see his goal and his believes shown in a few scenes, when Anton tells the old shopkeeper to ""call it"" he then says, ""i can't call it for you, it wouldn't be fair"" what does this say about his beliefs and purpose? 

when Anton has Carson Wells at gunpoint and Carson tells Anton that he knows where the satchel is, Anton says ""I know something better, i know where it's going to be"" what does this say about Anton's belief and Purpose? 

when Anton kills his employer, and speaks to the accounting man, telling him that he gave the Mexican's the receiver, and the accountant says ""he felt the more people looking"" and Anton says ""That's foolish, you pick the one right tool"" what does this say about his beliefs and purpose? 

And finally, with Carla moss, when Carla tells Anton that the coin doesn't have any say, and that's it's only him, he says ""i got here the same way the coin did"" what do you think that says about anton's purpose and beliefs?

fqihi1,MeLikesPineapples,Munich has got to be Spielberg's best work,"I grew up in the Middle East and have seen sirst hand the hatred between Israelis and Palestinians (I am a neutral on this and don't care for their agendas). But I can empathise with the plot of the movie because hatred is something they grow up with.

Regardless, as a film, Munich was fantastic! The tempo and music created tension when required, but mostly I absolutely fell in love with the camera work. The cinematography felt like a proper 70s noir (with the background zooms and shaky shifts).

It's not perfect. The movie dragged out quite a bit towards the final third with some unnecessary plot and cliché. 

But it's a really gritty, dark and tense film that is better than Bridge of Spies, in my opinion. It wasnt afraid to be controversial. Eric Bana and Daniel Craig were fantastic in their roles and carried the movie.

fqhpyu,ramandsa,Analysis of Idle Class (1961) by Charles Chaplin,"**Introduction****:**    

The Idle Class is one of Chaplin's last short films made during a transitional time in his career as he was shifting towards making feature-length films. Chaplin showed that he could combine drama and comedy in his first feature-length film The Kid released before The Idle Class, but he opted solely for comedy in The Idle Class. In this film, Chaplin plays his first dual role until his famous and last one in his 1940s political satire film, The Great Dictator. Chaplin's first role is of the familiar poor and gentle Tramp, and the second one is of a wealthy and alcoholic husband.    

Like every Chaplin film, this film contains many amusing gags throughout and some of them where we least expect them making them seem even funnier. But the film also manages addresses social issues regarding the differences in the treatment of the people based on their economic status in society.    

The title of the movie ""The Idle Class"" is referred to as the idle rich part of society. The Tramp represents the idle poor, whereas the rich husband represents the idle rich. There are various contrasting scenes of the rich and poor throughout the film. Chaplin even uses the theme of mistaken identity to have mock at the society as The Tramp is mistaken to be the rich husband and treated differently by all the people at the masquerade ball, but they would have thrown him out if they knew who he was.    

In the movie, Edna Purviance plays the role of the neglected wife, who is tired of her husband's drinking habit and leaves her husband until he gives up drinking. Mack Swain portrayed the character of Edna's father and Lita Grey as a maid and Al Ernest Garcia as the cop.

&amp;#x200B;

**Analysis****:**

**Synopsis:**    

The film begins at the railway station of Miami, Florida, in summer, where the servants are patiently waiting for the arrival of a train. When the awaited deluxe train arrived at the station, we see a couple of men and the wife (Edna) getting down from the train in their fancy clothes. The two men were carrying their golf clubs with them. Then, the little Tramp emerges from the compartment used for moving the fuses underneath the train carrying his golf clubs. This is the first scene where we see the social difference based on economic inequality.    

When the wife gets down from the train, she is looking for someone and seems disappointed. Meanwhile, her absent-minded husband is getting dressed to meet his wife at the station reads a telegram from his wife asking him to pick her up at the station. Realizing he is late to pick her up, he makes his way into the hotel lobby to make a call at the telephone booth but forgets to wear pants. Meanwhile, at the station, the wife is greeted by a servant and then escorted to a car with her two maids indicating her high position in the society. The Tramp takes a seat on the rear bumper of the vehicle, in which the wife is traveling, sitting in a manner in which more luxurious people of the society sits.    

While the husband is confined in the booth, as he forgets to wear pants, the wife makes her way towards the suite in which her husband is staying. Due to his absence, the wife gets further upset. She is unexpectedly shocked when the husband sprints through the rooms and ends sitting up in the bed. He hides his lower body under the sheets due to embarrassment. The wife takes a glance at her husband and, due to his suspicious behavior, decides to occupy separate rooms.    

Then came one of the most-funniest gag ever performed by Chaplin in his career. The husband gets a note from his wife, telling him, ""I will occupy other rooms until you stop drinking."" The husband reads it and slowly turns his back to the camera. He picks up the photograph of her wife from the table and stares sadly at it. His shoulders begin to shake as if he's crying and sobbing. It seems that he is filled with remorse, but when he turns around we see that he has a cocktail shaker in his hands!    

Link to the scene described above: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5vdV6-T4KM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5vdV6-T4KM)

The Tramp sneaks into the golf course attached to the hotel and realizes that he no ball to play golf with. But through several different manipulations, he soon becomes the possessor of multiple golf balls. While playing golf, The Tramp encounters a golfer (John Rand) who gets continuously beaten up by another big golfer (Mack Swain, who later turns out to be Edna's father) mostly because he unknowingly took the blame for The Tramp's innocent mischiefs for which The Tramp avoided the blame with good luck and fast feet.    

During his game, The Tramp sees the lonely wife ride by on horseback, and daydreams about rescuing her from a runaway horse on a donkey. In my view, the donkey depicts The Tramp in comparison with the horse, which represents the wife implying they are not in the same class and cannot be together in reality. After saving her in his dream, she falls in love with The Tramp and marries him, and The Tramp fathers her child until he awakens to realize that he is still the lonely Tramp.    

The next scene opens at the masquerade ball, and we see the husband getting ready for the masquerade ball wearing the armor of an early warrior. He finds a note from his wife, which says that she will forgive him if he comes to the masquerade ball. He throws the letter onto the table and starts making a cocktail using a cocktail shaker. But the headgear of the armor he is wearing gets locked, and he is not able to get it unlocked. The wife, dressed as Marie Antoinette, is waiting for him at the masquerade ball and gets disappointed in him as he doesn't show up again.    

In the meantime, The Tramp has been mistaken to be a pickpocket, and in his attempt to escape, the police officer finds his way into the masquerade ball. He is assumed to be a member of the ""The Idle Class"" in a unique costume. The wife mistakes him to be his husband due to their strong facial resemblance. The Tramp doesn't realize what is happening and goes along with the flow. The absent-minded husband with his head locked in the armor costume make his way into the masquerade ball to come across his wife flirting with The Tramp. The husband loses his temperament and then attacks The Tramp. With the help of the people at the masquerade ball, they are separated. Still confused about what just happened, The Tramp makes his way with the wife running into the wife's father, who happens to be the big golfer (Mack Swain).    

Mack introduces The Tramp and his daughter to other people as ""my daughter and her husband,"" The Tramp politely clarifies, ""Oh, no. We're not married."" Mack gets angry, leading to a wild chase that ultimately involves the real husband. Mack discovers that the man in the armor is the real husband.    

The Tramp is able to detach a part of the headgear from the armor, using a can opener, revealing the face of the husband. As the truth comes to light, The Tramp is ordered to leave the suite and is even neglected by the wife, who has taken a liking to him.    

Realizing it was not The Tramp's fault, the wife tells her father that they owe an apology to him. As the lonely Tramp was leaving, the father reaches out to him and apologizes. The Tramp shakes his hand and then draws his attention towards the father's shoe. As the father bends down to fix it, The Tramp kicks him and quickly runs away.

&amp;#x200B;

**Social differences based on economic status:**    

* The difference in which The Tramp and the wife travel on the train and from the railway station to the hotel are very contrasting in both the scenes.    
* The daydream scene in which The Tramp riding on a donkey saves the wife from the runaway horse describes their differing social position implying he has no hope of getting to know her.    
* How people behave to the same person depending upon on his/her economic status is also exposed in the film. For example, The Tramp is treated differently by all the people at the masquerade ball when he is mistaken to be the rich husband, but they would have thrown him out if they knew who he was and when the truth comes to light, The Tramp is ordered to leave the suite.    

&amp;#x200B;

**Mistaken Identity Theme:**    

The mistaken identity theme is prominent in the second part of the movie. It creates a different perspective only for the audiences. The audience experience what the character experiences by not knowing the true identity of the person on the screen.     

The famous City Lights scene in which The Tramp gets out of the car and is mistaken to be a rich person is also present in this movie, and the same thing happens here.    

&amp;#x200B;

**Interaction with Objects:**

* The door of the car introduces the theme of mistaken identity.    
* The use of a cocktail mixer changes the mood of the scene from grief-stricken to joyful.     
* The whole golf sequence is about only about the funny gags just with the help of just golf clubs and balls.    
* Objects speak for themselves. For instance, the golf bag owned by The Tramp is made out of torn clothes, whereas the other golfer had leather made golf bag signifying their difference in economic status.    

&amp;#x200B;

**The Music:**    

Like all the other movies of Chaplin, the music is an integral part of this film as well. It is used to describe the nature of the characters, to set the mood of the scenes, and also used to make a transition from one scene to another. For instance, the music used when The Tramp appears on the screen is slow, soft and sometimes mischievous/comical. But at the scenes when the husband is on the screen, the music is used is fast and sharp. The contrast in music is used to signify the difference in the personality of The Tramp and the husband, implying that The Tramp is kind, innocent, and a playful person, whereas the husband is cunning and unfriendly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Tramp's passion for golf:**    

The Character of The Tramp is very passionate about golf. He may not be one of the finest players of golf, but we can say from his stance and the way he hits the ball that he has played a lot of golf and have a knack to play and make the playing look elegant. He also carries the sand where he keeps the ball before hitting, because he knows that he may not like the sand that will be there in the court.    

The word ""lonely"" keeps reoccurring in the intertitles of the movie as the lonely Tramp, the lonely husband, and the lonely wife, implying that the money can't replace loneliness in life. The husband frequently drinks alcohol to compensate for his loneliness. The same thing happens in the movie City Lights (1931), the eccentric millionaire keeps resorting to drinking to fill the hole in his life left by his wife.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Moral and the immoral characteristics of the Tramp:**     

We see the Tramp manipulating various golf players in the golf court, where he plays golf alongside them. The Tramp doesn't have a golf ball, so when a golf ball comes to him, which was hit by another player, he had taken the ball and started playing with it, and when the owner of the ball came asking for it, The Tramp apparently denied him of having his ball. When another player hits the ball to where they were standing, the Tramp shows the ball and tells the first player that there was his ball and lets him hit it. When the first player offers him a cigarette, the Tramp takes out one cigarette and gives it to the player and keeps the cigarette case to himself due to the absence mindlessness of the first player. When the second player (whose golf ball was hit by the first player) comes in confronts the first player, and they start a fight, the Tramp runs away. He was the reason they were fighting, and him running away like this was very immoral.    

The Tramp also takes out golf balls of the sleeping person in the field, but when he discovers that he can take more than he needs, he doesn't hesitate to stop taking. This need for having more than we need comes in us, in the postmodern era. The social-economical structure is such that everyone feels inferior to their belongings and tries to acquire more and more quality products. This is again reflected in the film. When the Tramp gets a few golf clubs, which fell from the bag of a rich player, he takes them and starts to play with them and abandons his golf clubs. One can say that these events come as a result of the economic situation of the Tramp; a poor man becomes poor because of the exploitation of the rich ones he was stealing/taking off. The constant feeling of being inferior isn't just a phenomenon of the postmodern era. The Tramp has as much right as the rich men to play golf sophistically, but he couldn't afford to do it. And given his passion for golf and the economic condition, the audience somewhat tends to justify his actions, however wrong they may seem.    

But the Tramp shows his right side in the latter part of the film when he gets the chance to sit with the woman he liked and be introduced as her husband. When a waiter comes and tells the Tramp that the madam is waiting for him, he goes to her, holds her hand tightly and even kisses it as he loved the woman. But he doesn't question why the woman is showing her love towards her all of a sudden. Maybe he is too lost in his one-sided love and feelings towards her that he has lost all the thinking capabilities. He only comes back to senses when he is addressed as the husband by the father of the girl. He denies the fact despite being hit several times for refusing. But he understands that accepting it would be a crime, a sin. He stands up for what he believes and doesn't take a shortcut method to win his love instead tries to make her feel loved by the small innocent acts of love.    

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion****:**     

The Idle Class is a remarkable film in which Charlie Chaplin was able to find humor in alcohol, given his family history. The movie portrays the social differences among people based on their economic status and can be seen from three different points of view, namely of The Tramp, the husband, and the audiences. It mocks the world of the rich while displaying some of the fun they have.     

The movie doesn't stick to a single subject around which it revolves; instead, it comprises segments which are both acts of comedy and also delivers the social message that the layers intend to provide. So due to this problem, the movie doesn't stand as a whole. But if one sees the different segments of the film at a different time, then he/she will find the parts funny and engaging. So in this way, Chaplin was successful in making more short films in the short film itself.    

It seems that Chaplin's heart was already in the feature-length film. In the end, The Idle Class is a fantastic film by Charles Chaplin.",0,1585391753,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqhpyu/analysis_of_idle_class_1961_by_charles_chaplin/,movies,1

They entered a building, ( I want to say it was a lighthouse) and inside, one of the main characters ends up meeting some kind of being that has no facial features of any kind. All it does is copy every single movement that the main character makes, as if it knows exactly what their next move will be.

fqh26q,tartandavy,What did the Harry Potter movies get wrong that drives you insane?,"The 4th film was a disaster in itself, but there is one thing that always drives me insane while watching it, because it was such an unnecessary change.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me tell you something: Beauxbatons is not an all-girls school. **Durmstrang** is not an all-boys school.

&amp;#x200B;

What? You didn’t understand me? Let me repeat it:

&amp;#x200B;

**Beauxbatons** is not an all-girls school. **Durmstrang** is not an all-boys school.

&amp;#x200B;

Like really, what were the film makers thinking?

&amp;#x200B;

In the books, both schools were clearly implied to have male, as well as female students.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me show you some proof.

&amp;#x200B;

First, Durmstrang:

&amp;#x200B;

The Durmstrang students were staring curiously at Harry too. Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw comprehension dawn on a few of their faces. The boy with food all down his front nudged the girl next to him and pointed openly at Harry's forehead.

&amp;#x200B;

Even Durmstrang’s founder was a witch, so why would there be no girls at the school? It doesn’t make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, Beauxbatons:

&amp;#x200B;

Parvati sat down on Harry's other side, crossed her arms and legs too, and within minutes was asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons.

&amp;#x200B;

Fun fact: Nicolas Flamel was a student at Beauxbatons. So much with all-girls school.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, both schools clearly had male and female students, but for some reason, the filmmakers decided to ditch that. Now you could argue that they simply didn’t know that these schools weren’t all-boys and all-girls respectively, but why would they assume the latter in the first place?

&amp;#x200B;

My theory is that they changed it so that the students’ cringy entrance performances could be done without looking gay or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, guys participating in this cringefest might not have looked as “sexy”, right?

However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death.

God damn fine piece of work they did on this movie. 

A lot of tension and dropped many facts along the way, showing how there rivalry was built between the two companies. How Miles got to go down as a legend all on 1 bet placed by Shelby on his own company. If there was a wishing star or comet out in the world, I would make 2 wishes : 

1) that this virus we are all suffering from goes away and everyone keep safe

2) They make more car movies like this. 

The music score were put in at the right moment and nothing orchestral, or too flashy it was just right. Just the right push, making you lean forward and actually say ""Faaaaaaaar out !! Go man!!

Them
Prey at Night
Scream (the opening was more of a home invasion type than the whole movie but still)
You're Next
Hush

Do you guys have any recommendations? I'm not super into foreign films but if it's good it's good. 

I also liked The Collection, Vacancy, and Hostel (even though it's not a home invasion movie, it still kind of gives me the same vibe)

The day before we were hanging out and we ran into this other guy we knew from school and we said we were going to see that new movie everyone was talking about. And he goes: *Oh, you mean the Sixth Sense. Yeah,* &gt;!Bruce Willis is dead. !&lt;Man, oh, man. Why'd you do that? But I still enjoyed it and was still somewhat shocked by the ending. But I've always wondered what it'd have been like if I hadn't known, you know? 

I guess I got my wish some time later when I first saw The Others. I am not really good at seeing plot points coming, like some people are, and I hadn't figured out that &gt;!Nicole Kidman and her kids were dead. !&lt;

Anyway, has this happened to you and you were still able to enjoy the movie? And if you saw The Sixth Sense without knowing about the twist ending, what was it like for you? What was your reaction?

MASTERPIECES: 

- Forrest Gump
Very heartwarming, Great visual effects 

- Mulholland Drive 
Loved the ending, Intriguing mystery, Diner scene 

- Inglorious Basterds 
- The scenes were extremely tense like the opening one and the bar scene, This movie made scenes of people sitting so nerve wracking



EXCELLENT: 

- Blade Runner 
I was kind of bored at the beginning, but I liked the messages and the “battles,” especially the one against Roy, Idk why but I liked the “subtle” use of the unicorn, Ot was visually nice too (everything was made by hand!)

- Pulp Fiction 
Nothing really happened, but Great Dialogue of course, Funny scenes

- Reservoir Dogs 
I liked the opening scene, Idk I was pretty entertained throughout this movie



MEDIOCRE: 

- The Dark Knight 
I was pretty bored through some scenes, but the Joker was an amazing villain, I liked how there weren’t just action scenes 

- The Godfather 
Sorry, I know everyone loves this film, but it’s a little overrated but still likable, It was pretty slow, but I still liked it 

- A Clockwork Orange 
I found the messages intriguing, The ending was great, but it was only getting good towards the middle 



DIDN’T REALLY LIKE:

- The Royal Tenenbaums 
The movie was so slow 

- American Psycho
Boring 

CURRENTLY WATCHING: 

- The Count of Monte Cristo (2005) 
Love it so far, Edmond is very sympathetic 

GOING TO WATCH: 

-  A Beautiful Mind 
- The Usual Suspects 
- Taxi Driver 
- Apocalypse Now 
- The Terminator 
- Fight Club (after I finish the book) 
- Shutter Island 
-Catch Me If You Can 
-The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly
-Vertigo 

Probably gonna be more. This is the year that I’m starting to watch the classics. I’m using the IMBD Top 250 list. 



Anyways, I’m curious on what movie from the MASTERPIECE and EXCELLENT category you like the best.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.

Probably gonna be more. This is the year that I’m starting to watch the classics. I’m using the IMBD Top 250 list. 



Anyways, I’m curious on what movie from the MASTERPIECE and EXCELLENT category you like the best.

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  I'll post a new region every day.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

In the movie the character owes a bad guy money. Around the end of the movie, the camera shows the character ""dead"" in a vacant lot with blood on his face and a couple goons take a picture of him ""dead."" However, the character stands up and wipes the blood off his face. Turns out the goons/bad guy just wanted the picture as warning to others who owe him money.

fqend3,Common-Sensual,Magical movie moments in the theater,"During this time of quarantine or lockdown across a large part of the world, I guess it's natural to miss the theater-going experience. So let's share the moments which we found to be magical when watching a movie in the theater. Could be anything which made us appreciate the large screen - something about how immersive and intense experience it can be!

Here are my 5 most magical moments in the movie theater (in no order):

* **Jurassic Park** : There were multiple scenes which gave me goosebumps, but I will pick 3 - the introduction of dinosaurs (the big one standing on its hind legs), raptors in the kitchen, the one where people sat on trees and a long necked dino sneezed at them

* **Godzilla**: Atomic breath! When Godzilla breathes blue death down the MUTO's throat!

* **Interstellar**: Space is vast, and this made me feel so. It was a great experience for someone who has loved Asimov and Arthur C Clarke since school days

* **Inception**: Had to include another Nolan movie. Folding cityscapes, revolving corridors &amp; Penrose stairs take one's breath away on the big screen

* **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood**: Not an obvious one here, but just wanted to call out that it's not always about special effects. Big screens make for immersive scenes and Hollywood '69 comes alive in this movie on the big screen

fqem74,hwc000000,Is this a valid way to measure relative image size?,"My friend owns an 86"" TV and sits rather close to it (less than 10 ft away). He measures relative image size by stretching his arms fully out, then measuring how many hand spans (outstretched pinky to outstretched thumb) the screen is diagonally. His TV is about 2.5 hand spans because he sits so close to it. IMAX/Dolby are about 3 to 4 hand spans when he sits in his favorite seats. He says any theatre screen/seat combination which results in an image less than 2.5 handspans isn't worth paying for, since it's a ""smaller"" image than his TV.

Is this a valid way to compare image size for such widely varying screen sizes?",18,1585375689,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqem74/is_this_a_valid_way_to_measure_relative_image_size/,movies,1

Jeffrey Donovan and Kyra Sedgwick are another great pair, both very funny and also really creepy! I don't want to give anything away, not that it's super unpredictable or anything, but the way the story unfolds is a lot of fun to watch and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time regardless. I like the way it flips the home invasion genre around and gives it a breathe of fresh air.

While original, it had elements of Frankenstein and other monster movies of the past. A little bit of The Burbs and Nothing But Trouble vibes going on aswell. 

It stumbles abit in the third act... but it wasn't enough to deter my overall enjoyment. It seems I've discovered this film just at the right time, as there is a sequel coming out this year.

fqeafn,disneysmightyducks,How do you make the case for standalone movies in the golden age of television?,"I should start off by saying I love movies, probably more than television. But I'm in the midst of watching ""Ready Player One"" for the first time and couldn't help but think it would have made a better miniseries rather than a single movie. In fact, the story in this one film alone could have probably made a trilogy.

At the 2/3 mark, there's a big Endgame moment that, to me, didn't feel fully earned. There wasn't enough character development or knowledge of the world in that year to justify that sort of moment. The first half of the movie relied on a lot of exposition that I feel could have just been presented dramatically if there was just more time.

So I began wondering, why was this not just made into a miniseries when there are more than enough streaming services and premium networks out there who would have financed and released something like this? What did condensing it into 2 hours do to serve the story? Why should it have been a movie and not a miniseries?

Again, I love movies and, for all its faults, I'm finding ""Ready Player One"" quite enjoyable. I just want to hear what *you* think.

Personally, I find many shows draw out a story far too long by deviating from the original storyline. This usually has to do with it making money. But for the producers and director to predetermine the episode count and give themselves the necessary time to flesh out the story properly seems like a good idea and a better one than cutting stuff out, especially when it's being adapted, for the sake of runtime.",8,1585374117,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqeafn/how_do_you_make_the_case_for_standalone_movies_in/,movies,1

fqeac4,SoylentCreek,Has anyone seen Vivarium yet?,"I did not see a discussion thread, so decided to post something. I just rented this movie because I saw the trailer a few months ago and thought it looked intriguing. I have to say, I was pretty let down by it. To me, the movie felt like it would have worked wonderfully as a 20 minute short film, but there just was not enough there to justify a 90 minute runtime. Also, I was a bit frustrated with the ending of the film. I'm okay with films not spelling everything out for you, and letting the viewer make their own conclusions. However, this is a movie that is setup like a mysterious puzzle box where part of the fun in watching it is to learn what is actually going on. One of the characters in the film even goes so far as to say something along the lines or, ""You're such a mystery, and I'm going to crack you."" Turns out, they don't. Maybe I just missed something, which is why I wanted to come here and discuss the film.

fqe9x4,Real_MvB,Did Ava change her mind and go back to the house at the end of Ex Machina?,"I just finished watching Alex Garland's Ex Machina, and immediately went to look up the ending of Ava turning around after she has reached the mainland. This was clearly a long and important journey for her, and the last shot of the movie is of Ava turning around and disappearing into the mob of people (link to the ending below).

The vanishing-into-the-crowd portion I can understand, with her just becoming a member of society like anyone else. But her shadow is shown walking forward, then cutting to a shot of her for a moment, whereafter she turns around and disappears. I didn't really notice any hints of her possibly changing her mind or being reluctant earlier in the movie, but her turning around seems to me like she decided against living as a human, or possibly had some other change of heart. I couldn't find anyone else from YouTube comments and a Google search that had the same thought.

Of course, I could totally be reading too much into this two second action, but it just seemed odd to me that she didn't walk forward. Was it just to show her assimilating with the crowd? Did it have to do with her joining the direction that the crowd was walking? I'd love to hear any thoughts people may have!

These movies can be amazing but they fail to hit our hearts the way this film does. This film is simple and pure. I am reminded of the beauty we loose as children. That wonder and curiosity that drives us. We loose that as we grow up. We get conform to a society like a cookie cutter. We worry about who we are; thus we cease to see the beauty in anything or very little. Beauty is all around us. It does not matter if there is a god above or a spirit that lives in a tree to cause it. We need to just see that beauty and be happy to be alive and experiencing that beauty. We need to dream, get lost in the beauty be it happy or sad. 

I have had a hard time so far in middle and high school. I have been struggling with self esteem issues and depression. This movie seems to have marked the end of my depression. It has assured me of my meaning and purpose in life which I have been speculating for many years. It showed me beauty and love in a way no other film has or can. I am so grateful to have seen this magnificent work and so happy to be alive.

Many people already know the story of Peter Pan by memory because they read the book in school or watched the play.

What could this Disney live action version do differently what will make it worth it?

I guess it's going to be a ''Woke Peter Pan''. Peter will probably be black or non binary. Wendy will be a lesbian with short hair and glasses.

&amp;#x200B;

I accumulated the top 64 movies from 2019 based upon several critics lists and also IMDB.  Seeding was determined based upon Box Office success, rather than by favorite (because everyone has different opinions).  I figured that was easiest and also allows for exciting matchups and upsets.  Each round will consist of 24 hours of voting.  I'll post a new region every day.  After a winner of all 4 brackets is determined, we'll have the final four.  Once we get to a FINAL FOUR, I'll post that final bracket to determine the ultimate champion for the Best Movie of 2019.  Sounded like a good way to kill time during the stay-at-home.

(Spoilers)","My collection of scoundrels just completely botched a job for their new Hutt employer; as punishment, they're going to be tossed into the chaos of *Uncut Gems*. I am outlining various encounters and sketching in the details...the jeweller with poor judgment will be based on Nar Shaddaa, the gem in question will be a khyber crystal, the celebrity will be a podracer in an upcoming race, etc. I've been inspired by the unsettling cinematography/sound design to add real-time constraints to certain challenges, and will be doing my best to throw the players off tilt.

Where I'm unsure, however, is what specific side of the struggle will be more enjoyable for players. Their employer could initially task them with babysitting the jeweller and ensuring he gets the crystal safely to auction, or with collecting a smaller debt immediately from the jeweller without overtly harming him. The adventure will spin off in who-knows-what ultimate direction, but that initial bent will define their fundamental approach. Any insights from other fans as to what struggle would be most interesting to actually play?

my name is Luca and I'm from Italy, as you may know the whole country is in quarantine and it's not going to be over soon, hope everyone is good and safe around the globe.

I'm graduating in Film school and during this very special time me and some of my friends were thinking about a storytelling format, through social media (instagram stories), that could bring people together, a basic example could be people from all over the globe sharing a story, scripted and shot from every phone, or maybe a small video divided in frames and printed on pieces of paper held by people all over the world, and put back together with the editing, maybe mouthing the letter said in the frame of the video, making it more interesting.

I need all of your best ideas, what would you like too see, a project made from the people, that could bring everyone together, cultures, races, issues and everything that comes into mind.

Thanks everyone in advance, hope you have a great day.",0,1585360703,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fqb2b3/bring_people_together_storytelling_project/,movies,1

fqaz8m,DjangoTeller,What’s your favorite Sergio Leone’s movie?,"Leone is definitely one of my favorite directors of all time, especially as an Italian his movies have always been very important to me. Thanks also to the collaboration with Ennio Morricone, he created some of the best films in history, with a style that was something never seen before and that is still influential today. Also with the Dollar’s Trilogy he gave birth to a new genre, the Italian Western (full of beautiful movies by the way like Django, The Great Silence, The Grand Duel, Keoma, I giorni dell’ira and others). And those movies also made popular Clint Eastwood and Gian Maria Volonté, which I think he’s the best actor of all time. So I will always love those movies for this reason too.

Now, if i have to choose my favorite probably it would be The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, which is one of my favorite movies of all time, it’s so spectacular, epic and still so fun to watch. But all his movies are incredible and I really love in particular For a Few Dollars More, a beautiful and pretty emotional movie to me. I love the characters, the music (especially the carillon’s theme, so unsettling) and the ending. And El Indio is my favorite movie villain of all time.

But I would like to hear what you guys think, so what’s your favorite Sergio Leone’s movie?

It motivated me to just do what you want no matter how much it cost to you. As in the movie Ford wanted to beat Ferrari in the race. So to achieve that they collaborate with Shelby. And at last they won. The characters of Miles played by Christian bayle was fabulous. He way he converted him to Miles is fabulous.

It was every bit a good spy thriller should be.

One thing this brilliant film made me realize is that I love English Language Films made in Europe.

I know,I can find actual European Films which are made in Europe but ELF which is made in Europe was such an extraordinary experience.

Please recommend me other English Language Films made in Europe.

fq6ab1,pestro216,"I can't remember what this film is called, help?","I'm looking for a particular movie but can't remember most of the plot details or what it's called.

What I do know is that shadow people are involved, and that it might be post apocalyptic, but don't take my word for that. Something about having to stay in the light. 

There's a scene where the protagonist looks into the shadows (maybe past some Isles in a closed store?) and he sees a figure in the dark, it might be a manequinne, but it moves. 

I can't for the life of me find this movie on Google and it certainly isn't that shadow people horror movie that keeps being in the recommendations. 

I know its not much to go on, but if you guys can help me find this movie it'd be amazing.

fq4yfr,Xelia17,please help me find this asian movie,"hi! ive posted this on r/tipofmytongue but no answers coming in at all :( wondering if you guys can give it a go!

heres a copy and paste:
hi! so im trying to remember this movie i watched when i was in primary school, 2010-2013 i wanna say? but the movie was definitely made earlier.

i remember the film being in mandarin, but im not 100% on it being a China Chinese film, theres a possibility of it being Malaysian or Singaporean.

It was about this really really poor family, at the start of the movie the parents got in an argument and the father accidentally injures the mother by pushing her head into a wall (the pins in her bun piercing her head) and she has to go to the hospital. The fees are super expensive so the family is driven more into poverty. 

Theres 3 kids in total i think? some part during the film, the young daughter gets bullied and the bullies cut off her hair so after that in the film, the character went completely bald.

Theres also one scene towards the start of the film where theyre cooking noodles to eat, so they each got a small bowl and as soon as they take a bite, they share a look, understanding that its way too plain which makes the sister run and grab a seasoning packet and sprinkles some for each of them into their bowls. they then eat it really wholesomely while laughing.

Towards second act of the film the father borrowed money from some loan sharks, yada yada, they come for the kids to collect the money and the kids have to run for their lives.

Somehow someway some pregnant lady gets involved and shes running away from the loan sharks (?) too and they run into the forest nearby, and she goes into labor which then she is brought to some place to push the baby out and they filmed the snipping of the cord

Really sad and scarring film to see, but my school showed it to the entire school in the hall for whatever reason! 

anyways i cant remember the name of it... help?

 The movie is spectacularly shot with some really creative and beautiful camera work and usage of colours. It has an antagonist whose plight is surprisingly understandable. Plus the rest of the characters, while simple, have enough personality and good dialogue to make you at least care about them, Though John C. Riely really steals the show in that department. The creature design is creative, wondrous and terrifying which is brought to life by some really great special effects. The action is surprisingly brutal and intense as well but what's really impressive to me is after almost 4 decades of Kong remakes telling basically the same story this one actually manages to create something new while still paying homage to the original and being a total blast.

If only the monsterverse Godzilla films were this entertaining, I really hope they don't fuck up Godzilla vs Kong but I don't have super high hopes.",82,1585340483,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fq4uim/i_forgot_how_great_kong_skull_island_2017_is/,movies,1

fq4399,LilStrug,The Matrix should have been the third movie instead of first in the trilogy.,"There are a lot of opinions on if the Matrix sequels should have existed at all, but after reconsidering the trilogy and how it could have been better, I feel having 'The Matrix' as the third movie would help make the trilogy, as a whole, much better.  This helps re-introduce Neo and others back into the system establishing that events have once again repeated, but falls short of re-introducing Zion.  This also helps to establish a foundation the characters have all already met Neo/The One in a previous reality, even several times.  This helps cement the feel of familiarity everyone seems to have towards Neo.",7,1585338247,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fq4399/the_matrix_should_have_been_the_third_movie/,movies,1

I have a little movie marathon planned this weekend and am seeking suggestions. I am WAY into what I've heard described as 'instructive' movies. Movies that teach you stuff, either tangentially or as its primary purpose. A good example of this would be the recent ""The Current War"" which was as much about how electricity \*works\* as it was about the competition between Edison and Westinghouse.   


Beyond that, I recently saw Becket, which had a wonderful, talky, witty script.   


I'm curious what are some movies that are either super informative (See also: The Big Short) or very 'talky' in nature, ala Beckett, and I suspect, the Lion in the Winter.

fq1sju,DaKiddovol1,What is your favourite movie scene?,"My all time favourite scene is Beatrix Kiddo escaping her Texas funerael in Kill Bill Vol. 2 
For me it perfectly pictures that the film is so much more than a visual and auditory aesthetical ejaculation. Kill Bill is often described as a stylistic revenge flick, which is carried by Quentins geniune passion and love for grindhouse cinema, spaghetti western, martial arts etc. 
There is a danish poem, which describes a nation as a tree, and the culture as the water which nourishes it.
I see Quentins passion, Beautiful and unique technique as this big California redwood tree. It marvelous, and nobody has ever seen anything like it before. But such a tree needs one hell of a lot of water...and that is the beauty of the story, which mainly is shown my Beatrixs love-will-conquer-all will. 
The scene where she escapes, which is accompanied by perhaps Ennio Morricones best piece "" L'arena "". It is in that scene, that she begins this transcension from this cold revenge filled killer to this fragile human being, who thinks that erasing her past will somehow make up for the destruction of the future she had planned. She's scared and hurt. She isn't cold blooded, it's just a front to save her from the abyss she currently roams in. Destroying her past and no future.
It's also really necesarry, for me atleast, to see this transistion to accept, that she becomes the caretaker of B.B. her daughter. 
I enjoy the end scene as much, but I do consider this better, because of multiple reasons. As I said, this is the scene, that truly marks that transistion. The end has all of the movie as its fundament, so it has a natural climax. The ending has alot of more dialogue, which naturally supports the scene in many ways.

fq1jwu,joeyeatsfridays,"Theory: In Darren Aronofsky’s “Pi”, the main character never actually found the number.","I just came up with a cool theory about the movie Pi.

If you haven’t seen it, do so before reading this, but in case spoilers don’t bother you, the story centers on a mathematician who becomes obsessed with finding a cosmically important number with 216 digits that he becomes certain can predict and explain all of nature and the future.

Eventually, he does find the number, and Wall Street goons and a group of Orthodox Jews both wrestle for it, for different reasons.

However, the process of obtaining and understanding this number drives him to the point of insanity that he drills into his own head. But in the ending afterlife sequence (or the future, depending on how you choose to interpret it) at the very end, a little girl who often tests his mental math as a game asks him a problem, to which the answer is 46,665

The thing is, earlier in the film Max teased to the Jews that kidnapped him the possibility of simply combing through every single 216 digit number in order to find what they were looking for.

So out of curiosity, at that point I paused the film and decided to find out how many numbers that would be. To do that you just square 216. And the number was 46,656. 

That’s ALMOST the same as the answer to the girl’s math problem, except for two digits are switched. 

216^2 = 46,656

Girl’s number = 46,665.

The last two digits are flipped.

In my opinion, it would be a remarkable coincidence for this to be unintentional, especially with someone so arguably deliberate in his filmmaking as Darren Aronofsky.

—

This leads to me to the theory that the main character never actually *did* find the number. 

Therefore, the mystical qualities of the number aren’t what drove him mad, it was his own obsession with understanding it that did so.",20,1585330890,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fq1jwu/theory_in_darren_aronofskys_pi_the_main_character/,movies,4

fq15w6,Accelerant_84,Fallen (1998) is a bad movie and here's why,"Tried watching Fallen recently and it was just awful, not because of the actors or any technical deficiency, but because of a fundamental flaw in its storytelling.  If you watch the trailers or read the synopsis, you know that the film is about an executed serial killer whose vengeful spirit goes on to infect others so that he can continue his murderous ways, and it's up to a detective (played by Denzel Washington) to figure out what's going on and put a stop to the supernatural killer.  

The movie is actually pretty efficient in setting up the story, the relationship between the killer and the detective is shown during the opening credits and the killer is executed before the ten minute mark.  Even if you went in blind, you understand by minute fifteen that the killer's spirit has survived and is possessing others so he can continue his spree.  And here is where the movie falls apart and becomes a boring slog:

It takes nearly an hour before Denzel figures out what's going on.  Investigating the pattern of recent murders, putting the puzzle pieces together, until he arrives at the same conclusion the audience has already come to, just 45 minutes too late.  It makes for a very dull viewing to sit around and wait for a main character to catch up to the information we as the audience already know.

There's 3 ways to build suspense:

1.  A character knows something the audience doesn't.
2. The audience learns new information as a character learns it.
3. The audience knows something a character doesn't.

Now there's both good and bad examples of each, but I think #3 can be the trickiest to pull off for the reasons described above, the story has to be able to support the audience being ahead of a character, and pacing can play a huge part in that.  In Fallen, the pacing gets shot to hell because we just want our protagonist to get up to speed.  45 minutes of Denzel looking puzzled while we just keep repeating ""it's a murder spirit, DO SOMETHING"" does not a good film make. 

What do you think?  Any defenders of this movie here?  What are some good examples of this kind of suspense that you can think of?  Am I completely full of shit?  Let's figure it out!",9,1585329766,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fq15w6/fallen_1998_is_a_bad_movie_and_heres_why/,movies,0

&amp;#x200B;

Mine is *Amy Dunne* (Rosamund Pike) from the movie *Gone Girl*.

Amy Dunne is such a powerful and complex character that I could'nt stop hating yet admiring all throughout the movie : she is smart and badass but crazy at the same time. The final scene really sold it for me : Amy Dunne is the perfect villain that I love hating. I think Rosamund Pike delivered a great performance but the screenwriting was absolutely amazing.

fpyyvw,sadrecipes,The Platform (2019) shows how much tense a single-location movie can be,"I love single-location movies like Pontypool, The Exam, Buried, Cube, and many more. If done right, unlike the Circle, they can be just as tense as a huge blockbuster movie. High stakes. Good dialogue. Interesting scenarios. 

While this isn’t purely a single location concept due to two flashbacks, this movie was insanely suspenseful and exciting. I couldn’t believe how gripping the scenario was. To be fair, this single location setting was spectacular and the CGI was amazing, so though it is a single location, it does give a damn amazing location.

It’s on Netflix, recommended, has subtitles, but was maybe my favorite movie to watch during this quarantine, or at least on par with Freaks.

If you want to see what a storyteller can do with a single location, watch The Platform, and then watch as many single location movies as you can find. They’re super fun viewing and require great writing to stay engaging. This one is definitely a cool one.",49,1585323248,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpyyvw/the_platform_2019_shows_how_much_tense_a/,movies,1

then 2 days ago i started watching the animated  tv series of harley quinn and its incredible. its smart, offensive, charming and well written. some jokes are genius. its absurd good. i had tears running from laughing, its that good. i thought it was a children serie, but it aint at all. its R-rated.  

but what absolutely baffles me, is that the movie and the series are released in the same year , but the difference in quality is huge. someone who understand harley quinn made the series. someone who absolutely had no idea released the movie. who makes these kind of decisions? if the series was as bad as the movie then i understood. but since the series is so good, i just dont understand DC/warner created such a bad movie? how is this possible?

So I've been using my blessing of work-at-home to catch up on classic films I've never seen. And while the others I've watched so far have been good and noteworthy, The Wicker Man has just blown me away, made me feel so much more, and I've been working while watching it the same as the others.

&amp;#x200B;

For those of you who were around in 1973, this thing must have been a STUNNER. And I just appreciate the fact that this movie goes from zero to WHAT THE FUCK in the first fifteen minutes. This movie has no chill, no fucks to give to your precious ""modern pacing"" and ""old movies are boring and slow."" The opening credits thank the Lord Summerisle for sharing his island's religion with the filmmakers. You know something weird is up.

&amp;#x200B;

Boom, Sgt. Howie lands his seaplane and the locals are gruff and off putting the most perfect way. AND IT JUST GETS WEIRDER FROM THERE.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the plotting and pacing are masterful. The scene where the schoolteacher hems and haws over the way the officer sees the world through his lens of Christianity and her point of view was great. You really feel the struggle of a man who has accepted a certain way of life to be a granted, and just cannot come to grips with meeting people who are, for him, an outside context problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

And did I mention this movie has no chill? The locals launch into a ribald and raunchy song about the innkeeper's daughter while they're all standing there, and the scene (That still haunts me with its beauty and horror) of Willow drumming in time to the music and singing, naked and attempting to seduce/summon Sgt. Howie. He's frantic, mad with lust, drenched in sweat, and manages to resist temptation. In my mind, she's casting a spell. It has to be. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, the movie is smart enough to leave it up to our imaginations. While it's shown that the locals believe in the magic and their religion, it's up to us to decide if it has some truth. That the hand of glory makes an appearance later, and that Willow is worried that it will put the sergeant to sleep for too long, is a nice touch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Every scene serves the plot and the atmosphere. The acting and writing are magnificent. I think my favorite scene, overall, is early on when Howie sits down with the little girl who is painting a hare, and begins to gently question her. He does it perfectly: he engages in mutual play with her, uses a gentle tone, and asks open-ended but not leading questions. That, what, three minutes? Could be used to train modern people in talking to children.

&amp;#x200B;

Christopher Lee, the whole cast, everything about this horror gem was perfection. It didn't matter that I knew what was going to happen. I was just as disturbed at the ending, at the grim certainty of the worshipers, and the nice little twist in the gut when you realize that his screaming at the crowd at the end is just another animal noise.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, wow, wow.

&amp;#x200B;

Were the 70's a golden age of horror? Between this and The Exorcist, I'd say it was certainly a strong genre. (I would also acknowledge the current and great horror of the modern era as well.)",43,1585319488,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpxwk2/the_wicker_man_1973_what_a_masterwork/,movies,1

fpxul4,ihwayne,Dick Tracy is a stylish and fun classic with an all star cast.,"Just finished Dick Tracy for the first time since I was a kid. I can't believe how fun this movie is to watch. The set designs and colors fit the 1930s comic book aesthetic so we'll and translated to film better than it had any right to. Warren Beatty, Madonna, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, James Can, Dick van Dyke, and Kathy Bates are the highlights of a star studded cast. 

Of course the plot is a simple classic detective caper, but is never boring. It isn't perfect, Madonna's performance was a little flat especially in scenes playing directly off Beatty.

Overall it is a fun, easy and stylish watch that is reminiscent of Batman (1989) and not only because of the familiar Danny Elfman score. If you haven't seen it in a while I highly recommend it.",28,1585319277,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpxul4/dick_tracy_is_a_stylish_and_fun_classic_with_an/,movies,1

fpxt87,FelixthefakeYT,"Jojo Rabbit is my new favorite movie, and here's why.","Jojo Rabbit, if you don't know, is a movie about a 10 year old boy, living in Germany, 1945, who finds out his mother is hiding a Jewish girl in the walls. Without going into too many details, it obviously involves him growing out of his fanatical obsession with the Nazi state's indoctrination. The reason I love this movie so much is that, while it's comical in the beginning, it really hits your heart right in the guts at the end, especially if you're in a situation like mine.

You might not care about my personal life, and you don't have to, however, it affects me personally, as, I'm ashamed to admit, I was a neo-nazi just last spring, due to my parents falling prey to the ideology.

When I saw the trailers, I thought it was just more ""Jewish propaganda"" to ""indoctrinate the masses""

I am essentially Jojo. In a different world where my ignorance was intolerable, and I found the correct path after 2 years in the dark. It also reminds me of my nephew, who is only 7, and due to more personal things that don't relate to this, is already spouting racist, homophobic, and misogynistic ideas because my brother-in-law (his stepfather) and my father keep filling his impressionable head with the evil ideas, as Nazi Germany did with millions of young boys his age in it's time.

If you haven't watched it already, maybe you can find more appreciation for it now, as when I finally got to watch it, it cut me deep. I don't want to run from the past I created, but I do want to use this movie as a propeller forward, to never, ever being like that again.",163,1585319131,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpxt87/jojo_rabbit_is_my_new_favorite_movie_and_heres_why/,movies,1

fpxggk,mantaraypreviouslife,The John Wick movie universe is set inside a video game,"The John Wick movies are based on a video game. The film has many elements of a video game:  

+ John Wick moves through the movie killing NPCs before encountering an end stage boss who is usually more difficult [Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0LuDSiX63M)| [Link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pv70ImW-l3s) | [Link 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-TZCEyok_o) | [Link 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUqJMPAtmdY)  
+ There is minimum dialogue during the action scenes. Dialogue takes place before and after the action scenes like cut scenes in a movie  
+ John Wick is injured regularly as he goes about John Wicking, but when he is, the injury effects are short-lived. It is as if he is picking up health packs along the way. He shouldn't be walking, let alone fighting after getting stabbed, cut, sliced and shot.  
+ Coins are used in the movie in exchange for goods/services *(ok, the idea of currency did not originate in video games but gold coins remind me of Mario and Zelda)*  
+ The background characters mostly seem quite indifferent to the rampant [violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CujcdaQpYWE), like typical [nonchalant NPCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiNzN-tIz4A)    
+ The Continental is the shop / game admin area where John Wick goes to recharge his health, get supplies and save the game. In this place, the game’s action stops per the rules of the Continental but these rules are flouted as John’s awareness of the game around him unravels.  

Future John Wick films will progress the story plot of John Wick realising he is a person controlled character in a video game and him trying to fight/shoot his way out of it to take revenge on the game creator(s) who created his wife and her death.  
I’d love it if at this point, John Wick is revealed to be a conscious being in the matrix like [Neo](https://www.quora.com/In-Matrix-Reloaded-how-does-the-Merovingian-know-of-Neos-predecessors-if-the-architect-tells-Neo-that-no-one-knew-of-his-predecessors?share=1), and the JW universe is one of the many simulations alluded to by the Architect and the Merovingian.

fpwibq,MovieMike007,Are Tim Burton's Batman films as good as we remember them?,"With Marvel and DC battling it out with their current cinematic universes one shouldn't forget the rocky road the genre has suffered.  Back in the 70s Richard Donner proved a superhero movie could be a blockbuster the, sadly, then the studio did their best to run that franchise into the ground, but in 1989 out came Tim Burton's take on the Dark Knight, a film that exploded across cinemas and brought life back to the genre.  Now, the questions are ""*Do his film's hold up and are they good ""Batman"" movies?""*

[Batman (1989)](http://manapop.com/film/batman-1989-review/) Tim Burton's his visual flair cannot be disputed; a flair that was wonderfully aided by concept artist Anton Furst, whose gothic architectural designs gave us one of the best-looking Gotham Cities to date, all brought to life through amazing sets and matte paintings as well as Bob Ringwood’s costuming, which brought one of DC’s legendary heroes brilliantly to life. But on the other hand storywise things don't hold up as well, with elements introduced as suddenly as they are forgotten, and then there is the unfortunate decision to have Joker being the one who killed Bruce Wayne's parents.  It’s clear that Tim Burton was focused on making a gothic fairy tale version of Batman, a *Beauty and the Beast* meets Fritz Lang if you will, and that having a solid story structure was not a primary concern.

[Batman Returns (1992)](http://manapop.com/film/batman-returns-1992-review/) If his first Batman movie was a gothic fairy tale then the sequel was Grimm to a magnitude of ten.  One thing that cannot be denied is that Michelle Pfeiffer’s performance as the fractured Selina Kyle was easily the best element of Batman Returns, and her scenes with Keaton are the film’s highlights as the two have undeniable chemistry together, but the decision to include multiple other villains was a mistake.  If Batman at times seemed like a second banana to the Joker in the last film he leaves even less of an impression in this one. The version of the Penguin in this movie never made sense to me - raised in the sewers by penguins - and as fun as Christopher Walken is to watch his character was certainly not needed.  Visually speaking *Batman Returns* is simply gorgeous but on the plotting side of things, it's a little haphazard.

fpvwqa,Daedalus-Prism,The Quiet Man For TV?!,"This actually straddles Movies and TV, so I will probably try this on both subs. I am a big fan of this John Ford film - its dialogue, characters, strong sense of place, and social dynamics and customs.

And with all the ridiculousness going on right now, I suppose that I would like something similar to sink into as a bit of comfort viewing.

So, any TV show recommendations out there for something similar? As I have thought about this for a bit, I have realized that this isn't as easy for me to nail down as I might have first thought: small town or village in scenic, rural setting, interesting locals, good dialogue, funny without being constant comedy, strong sense of place...

The only things that I have been able to come up with are: Northern Exposure, Letterkenny (although, that is so dialogue driven, that I don't feel like it gets around to the other qualifiers as much)...The Andy Griffith Show? (I honestly haven't seen an episode of this in years, so I am going by the vaguest of memories.)

fpvoae,Jordan-O-1,Is Hollywood really as bad as people claim?,"For many years, i've seen people complaining about Hollywood being just play and no work and dumb fun, remakes and franchises. The problem with this is: A original movie comes out and is amazing. People: Movies like this doesn't get made anymore. What did you just watch then? In 2019 if you want a beautifully shot action movie you watch John Wick 3. Even marvel movies at least tell a story instead of a Michael Bay film. If you hate Adam Sandler, good, then you go watch Uncut Gems. If you want a not sjw female film you watch Little Women. If you want a well made remake of Taxi Driver you watch Joker. If you want a great buddy horror smart dark comedy you watch The Lighthouse. If you want a great realistic film you watch Marriage Story. If you want a beautifully shot war film, 1917 🤣. Rocketman improves so much on Bohemian Rhapsody's mistakes. If you want a great historical drama you watch The Irishman. If you want a actually clever and smart and hillarious mystery you watch Knives Out. There's too many good films this year and foreign movies have been top notch too. Even Parasite won a Oscar. Toy Story 4 laughs at illumination 😅. Even all the people i meet who complain first say: Hollywood can't creare anything original. I ask them what they've watched and they answer: FORD V FERRARI AND JOKER 🤣. I give him a complete list of masterpieceses but then he changes the topic and says he wants sci-fi 😅. I respect people's opinions but not those who loved many films this year but still belives in a Lie and those who haven't watched any.

His Spider Man is quite a hit or miss to most audiences but the chemistry between him and Emma Stone is the saving factor. In fact, I think Emma’s greatest on screen partner is him rather than Ryan Gosling.

Anyway, back to Garfield - love him in The Social Network and he should have been nominated for that. He was also great in Silence, Hacksaw Ridge and 99 Homes. 

I think he is a great contender for the Oscar in the future. He will also be in “Tick Tick Boom” that is helmed by Lin Manuel Miranda so that is interesting.

There needs to be a blockbuster household name earning film like Saving Private Ryan on the Eastern Front. A lot of people base their gists of history on movies, and movies like Fury etc while respecting the Western Front neglect to inform the viewer about who really won the war. The Russians won it, and they could’ve and would’ve even without a Western Front at all. Their sacrifices should be viewed by the average moviegoer who may not know this. Please note I’m not trying to negate the sacrifices made on the Eastern Front either, in fact those men were probably Europe’s safeguard against total Soviet oppression.",35,1585301972,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpu3yv/there_needs_to_be_a_blockbuster_ww2_film_on_the/,movies,1
fpu2w7,Chaosmusic,"Movies where the 'heroes' either cause, allow or are indifferent to the death of others","I know the morality of the Matrix office fight scene has been discussed where Neo and Trinity essentially murder a bunch of police or security guards and tried to think of other examples.  They seem to fit into a few categories.

The heroes are portrayed as the villains.  Like the Matrix example, the heroes seem like the villains and the poor guards or whatever try to stop them.  Judge Dredd (1995) has this.  Dredd is convicted of murder, exiled and returns.  The Chief Judge murders the council and blames Dredd, so the cops chase him.  Dredd straight out kills several of them in the rocket bike chase scene.

Heroes allows deaths through delay or inaction or simply casualties of fighting.  Man of Steel with the Metropolis fight is an example.  Another is Green Lantern (2011).  Ryan Reynolds has dealt with Hammond but Parrallax is wreaking havoc in Coast City, but Hal decides to have a conversation with Carol Ferris for a few minutes.  Had he left immediately to confront Parralax, who knows how many people could have been saved.  In the current Batwoman series, Alice has been saved or let go or allowed to escape by Batwoman several times and keeps killing security guards, cops, scientists and a poor, innocent psychiatrist.

Someone close to the heroes has died and they don't care.  In the beginning of Hellboy 2: The Golden Army, Hellboy is joking around with the BPRD agents showing that he seems to get along with them.  While investigating the auction massacre, the tooth fairies attack and kill pretty much all the human agents but Hellboy uses the attack as an excuse to expose himself to humanity by getting himself blown out a window.  In Star Wars, Luke gets over the death of his aunt and uncle pretty quickly.  After the escape from the Death Star, Leia is consoling him over the death of Obi Wan, who he literally met the day before, despite the fact that her entire planet had just been destroyed.  Clerks already covered the actual destruction of the Death Star itself.

Curious what examples others may have noticed or thought about.",33,1585301806,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpu2w7/movies_where_the_heroes_either_cause_allow_or_are/,movies,1

fptpbe,TheGoldenMoustache,Interrupted Movies,"Okay, so my sister in law is staying with the wife and I while we isolate during this whole virus situation. She had never seen Skyfall, and I’m an enormous Bond fan. I have it downloaded to a USB drive that’s plugged into my tv. We get to about the two hour mark, about five minutes into the climax of the whole film, when it just freezes. We try and try to get it working but it keeps freezing at the same exact point and won’t go on. We try to play it on a laptop and grind through the rest of it by skipping forward after it freezes once or twice more.

I am beside myself. I’m pretty OCD at the best of times, but I’m enormous movie fan. I get extremely into the immersion of watching films. I have almost zero patience for people talking, being on their phones, getting up and walking away for random reasons, etc. Even if it’s just at home and even if it’s a movie I’ve already seen a hundred times. And I know I’m a bit overboard about it. There’s just something about those distractions that keep me from really being able to lose myself in the experience of a film. If I can’t fully get into the movie, my ADD makes it really hard to focus otherwise.

This is a series I care a lot about. It’s important to me. I’m showing it to someone who has never seen it before. It should be awesome. And after two full hours of getting wrapped right up in this thing with the big screen and full surround sound... the brakes get thrown on. With about fifteen minutes left, mid-climax, we fiddle around trying to just get the damn thing to *play* for twenty minutes in which all immersion and momentum is completely lost. And to finish it on some dinky laptop, not to mention fast forwarding through two other quick parts... just annoyed. Really annoyed.

What really boggles my mind is how the other two were basically totally unaffected by this. Didn’t care at all. So my question is... how much do you care about immersion? How seriously do you take your movie-watching experience, either at home or at the theatre? Am I crazy for being so crushed, or can you relate to having your movie-watching experience “ruined” like that?

fpt75h,henry_tbags,"I saw Knives Out (2019) today, and was disappointed.","Honestly, I liked many parts of it, so I'll start with the positives.


This was my favourite Rian Johnson film. I liked it more than Brick (boring), Looper (nonsensical), and The Last Jedi (I'm not getting into it here lol). The acting was consistently great for the most part. I wish Lakeith Stanfield and Jamie Lee Curtis got to have as much fun as some of the others, but that's not really a negative. There were a number of amusing running gags that got chuckles every time, like Marta's nationality, or each family member apparently being outvoted about her presence at the funeral. The look of the movie is great; I don't know enough about cinematography so I won't pretend to critique it deeply, but I liked the colours, as well as the use of shades/darkness. Lastly, everyone claiming to have ""built something from the ground up"" while also clamoring for the old man's money was a pretty funny way to enforce the theme of the privileged being truly ignorant about the working class and the difficulty of immigrants, even while arguing with each other through flimsy political separation.


However, while I only really have two negatives, they were enough to bring my enjoyment level down a few notches.


The main issue was pacing. Specifically, because the first hour played out like a completed mystery story, so much of what followed felt like an overly extended epilogue. The speed of information given to the audience in the first act was perfect: a lot of exposition, different points of view, but never too fast to follow; classic mystery stuff. More importantly, we're taking in every point hoping to find out what really happened. After that, we stopped being an audience who wanted to know the truth, and become an audience that watched Daniel Craig try to figure out what we already knew. I guess other people didn't mind, but man did I find it tedious watching him be annoyed about muddy footprints and the like when we already knew what was up.


And yes, I know that in the end it turned out we didn't *actually* know the answer, and the detective was indeed ahead of the viewer. But this honestly didn't feel satisfying because the audience didn't even know that they didn't know, so there was no tension or desire for the truth. This would be like if the fake and real reveals in The Usual Suspects (1. Keaton was Keyser Soze, and 2. Verbal was lying the whole time) came in the first and third acts respectively, instead of both in the third. I understand that the first resolution paves the way for Johnson to add his own flourishes to the whodunnit genre, kinda like the ""Once Upon A Time... Later"" second act of Into The Woods. But once the plot ""felt"" resolved, every other development just irritated me, and this point came before the movie's halfway point. It's probably a subjective/personal thing though, so I would actually still recommend the movie to people.


My second negative was Chris Evans' performance. I don't know why, but it just didn't work for me. When he was being a gleeful dick, it felt forced. Also, when he went to stab Marta, I have no idea why Johnson opted for slo-mo. If he had done that in real time, I might have been shocked into believing that he murdered her, but instead I was just waiting to see exactly how she survived. That's not on Evans, but it added to my less than favourable impression of the character.",25,1585296688,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpt75h/i_saw_knives_out_2019_today_and_was_disappointed/,movies,1

fps2vf,hgilbert_01,Frozen 2 is actually pretty good...?,"Hi.

I use the ""Review"" flair lightly as this is more of a quick opinion piece, but I must expressed how much I enjoyed and was absolutley pleased by both Frozen movies. During this quarantine, my family and I watched both movies on Disney Plus, and I must say, I enjoyed them thoroughly. Unfortuantley, they are still subject to some overdone to death Disney tropes, but to make up for it, there is very powerful and emotionally resonant defiance to be present.

However, I would like to focus on Frozen 2 in particular. It's entirely understandable that public reception of it wasn't entirely positive; I can defintiley see some components of the first movie being signifcantly stronger than the second one. Still, I can't deny the power the second one still has.

I think a major positive for me was having more screentime with Elsa this time around and her journey. As an introvert, I was delighted to have an introverted character in the form of Elsa to relate to and follow in her journey. Her ""superhero moments"" were not only engaging spectacles, but also emotionally impactful.

I guess the major disappointment for me was the lack of a consistenly present villain- it was sort of Elsa's and Anna's grandfather, but it still felt a little missing. Nonetheless, I think I actually appreciate the unique approach to the ""antagonist"" being more about the reprecussions of evil committed in history and the conflict being more about the journey. 

This is going to be a point of controversy, but I think I preferred the songs in this one to first one. I know the Hans' one may have been a little goofy, as well as his overall arc, but I found some appreciation with it.

Oh, and the visuals are absolutely top notch- the are appropiatley characterized, but depicted in stunning realism. Not just in visual details, but in the realistic manner in which they are portrayed. What a gorgeous world.

So yeah, there's my spiel... Frozen 2 is amazing. What do you guys think?

It was a huge building and different countries had soldiers (male and female) in the building and they were battling each other as they moved floor to floor and room to room, but I think it was kind of campy.  
I know there were Chinese, and Swedish and I believe British and American units.  It had an anti war/cold war feel and also a ""we have relegated war to this building"" sort of theme.
I believe there were observers/judges that would occasionally pop up and disqualify or provide scoring.
For some reason, I think Peter Sellers was in it, but that may be juxtaposition from something else.
I think there was a scene where the British or French soldiers get to a floor and it is the ""R&amp;R"" floor and they hang out with the Swedish unit (all females of course).  This is what made me think it was campy.

fpp4a8,Mr-Zilla,Does Hollywood spend too much on their movies?,"This might sound like a weird question but I genuinely believe that a lot of movies would benefit from having less money thrown into them.

So many movies have hundreds of millions of dollars put into them and it just seems a bit excessive even by modern standards. I mean, just look at movies like [Trollhunter](https://youtu.be/WhGFwk58h34), [District 9](https://youtu.be/VgwJLETdrMw), or [A Monster Calls](https://youtu.be/kXuXzmfEW_0). All of these movies have impressive visuals despite none of them costing over $43 million. I've noticed that when movies have smaller budgets, they tend to put more thought into how they're going to pull off the effects. [Shin Godzilla](https://youtu.be/M89VLZgo1Vg) made the titular monster look so realistic by rendering his textures to look like a rubber suit since they couldn't afford to try and do realistic textures. [Moon](https://youtu.be/tEsypRdBjcA) was mostly practical. This also applies to animated movies. [Space Pirate Captain Harlock](https://youtu.be/1vdw0If6Zzg) looks better than a lot of western movies despite a budget of only $30 million. Don Hertzfeld's [it's such a beautiful day](https://youtu.be/HC-zPWb7bQc) was independently produced and made mostly by one man, but not only is the imagery striking, it's inventive. It just seems like most mainstream big budget movies don't have visuals that are as impressive, varied, or unique. Even some of the [most](https://youtu.be/z79ikmr3JY8) [expensive](https://youtu.be/1R65kOQd9n0) [movies](https://youtu.be/jZAYgGhvBEc) [ever](https://youtu.be/J_BfAhQIcqA) [made](https://youtu.be/rtFJfZuCCT0) [leave](https://youtu.be/IQWtTLEslg8) [a](https://youtu.be/WIr_dCgNAjM) [lot](https://youtu.be/LOACsaFA_FY) [to](https://youtu.be/cQiALGzRePc) [be](https://youtu.be/ifoFercJX2I) [desired](https://youtu.be/RVaqFbeHWzY).

Studios would also save a lot of money if they didn't use CGI for everything. Even when adjusted for inflation, movies like [Metropolis](https://youtu.be/fugbcB-mZzw), [Blade Runner](https://youtu.be/P1jXmJmmj3o), [Fantasia](https://youtu.be/LpKA9n-75tQ), and [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://youtu.be/ebmwYqoUp44) would all cost under $100 million. If less money means the return of models, costumes, makeup, puppets, stop-motion, and 2-D animation into the mainstream, then I'm all for it.

I also feel like it would also help prevent reshoots. That's one of the biggest problems in Hollywood today. Going back and making changes late in production that can end up ruining the entire movie making the whole thing feel cheaper than it is. If they have less money they'll use it more sparingly and try to get things right the first time. [I Am Mother](https://youtu.be/N5BKctcZxrM) only had ONE robot suit in the entirety of its production because that's all they could afford. The result is one of the best practical robots ever put to film.

I'm not saying this applies to all movies. There are plenty that would [benefit](https://youtu.be/cWMT_0AFOfg) [from](https://youtu.be/X5ThccaxWmk) [more](https://youtu.be/XKFuBOuxUgk) [money](https://youtu.be/7ZO614WdcE8), and ones that [utilize](https://youtu.be/1FhG3jEPYIQ) [big](https://youtu.be/rL6tVAeIch4) [budgets](https://youtu.be/rRr0Dg9faQc) [well](https://youtu.be/-uKtIo3RrFs). I'm just saying, maybe studios shouldn't give THAT much money to AS many productions as they do.

I get that these universes have their fandoms, but these franchises are covered in dust and niche. I didn't see 2049 because there was so much good MCU/Star Wars stuff coming out and the same might be true with Dune, it's just hard for these movies to compete with the big franchises. 

The solution for Dune and similar big budget sci-fi like Blade Runner and Alita is to to adapt the script so that they fit into comic book universes or even the Star Wars universe. For fantasy, maybe you could do it with Game of Thrones if that would be possible with licensing. You wouldn't even need to radically alter the movie, just include a cameo or two or find away to weave it into these existing properties.

After all, I don’t think musicians necessarily make the best directors (see: The Fanatic).

After watching, I can confidently say that it’s one of the coziest, strangest, and most interesting movies I’ve ever seen. It’s an alien view of Americana at its strangest, featuring Byrne as the ever-present narrator and guide to the town of Virgil, Texas, John Goodman as the romantic Dancing Bear in one of his first lead roles, and a whole slew of character actors, all memorable in their own ways. It’s also a movie that can easily be seen as both a critique and a love letter to the small town oddities of America, a beautiful portrait of the lives of the many ordinary people who everyone else thinks are fucking insane.

fpo7uq,niceemperor1,2001: A Space Odyssey interpretation questions,"So I just watched 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time in my life on blu ray and I'm sure that most people, including me, don't really ""get"" or ""understand"" what exactly happened in this movie. I really like the visuals and the whole monolith and HAL 9000 AI-going-rogue-thing and I really liked the movie overall, I just don't really understood it. Wtf were does last 30 minutes? I felt like on an acid trip with all these colors and images of earth and space with that music blasting through my headphones and it didn't seem to stop. Then we ""landed"" in that weird designed room and that whole thing with getting older and rebirth happened. I know that rebirth and evolution are some of the big subjects this movie touches upon but does anybody care to explain to me what all those colors and images, that I earlier mentioned, meant and would anybody explain to me what exactly is up with the monolith and the whole rebirth/evolution thing? I guess that there is no clear answer and I think that everyone can and should have an own interpretation of the movie but I would love to know your interpretations guys and maybe enlighten me in some aspects.

fpnyxc,alfonsoilog,Knives Out VS Murder on the Orient Express,"So, I decided to dowbload and watch ""Knives Out"" last night, due to the ""unfortunate events"" that are currently happening. It was long overdue on my watchlist, and I was genuinely intrigued by the trailers, but I was, ultimately, not able to see it in theaters. And since, I got nothing better to do, I decided to finally watch it.

Holy crap! I was only half way in the film when I muttered to myself, ""Now, I understand why people loved this film"". Then, the third act happens, and it got me freakin' screaming in joy. Never have I been THIS satisfied by a film in a long time. The entire plot was just perfect, had well-written characters, amazing character moments... you name it. All the ingredients to a fun, engaging, well-written movie were there, and I will certainly watch it again, for a number of reasons.

With regards to ""Murder on the Orient Express"", I want to know your opinions on which between the two is better. Because, I remember watching ""Orient Express"", feeling ""bored"". Maybe it had to do with my mood while watching it, but I was already having a hard time catching up with the plot during the first and second act, that I started to lose interest in catching up at all. ""Knives Out"", for me, was far more engaging and kept my eyes glued to the screen, so glued where it came to the point that I was completely silent throughout the first hour, since I was giving the movie my full attention. It keeps things going; it kept me on the edge of my seat. There was no dull moment in ""Knives Out"". With that aside, am I being way too biased? And does ""Orient Express"" deserve a rewatch? Is it a genuinely good film? Or was ""Knives Out"" just a really better film than ""Orient Express""?

Would want to know your honest opinions. 😊",29,1585272189,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpnyxc/knives_out_vs_murder_on_the_orient_express/,movies,1

I have grown a massive appreciation for the Marx Brothers ever since I started watching their films. Horse Feathers and Duck Soup especially stand out as my absolute favourites, but the four brothers made their mark on Hollywood in the best way they possibly could. I’m always curious to see who people prefer in terms of comedic sensibility, so I thought I’d gauge it: vote for who you personally think was the funniest of the four Marx Brothers: Groucho, Chico, Harpo or Zeppo

fpncn5,kikiswirline456,Who is your most hated movie character in cinema?,"My is Dean from Blue Valentine. I understand that he was supposed to be an obnoxious manhchild but still.....the film did such a good job with it that I don’t want to see the film ever again. Here are some examples as to why I find him intolerable:

1. He practically dragged Cindy to the hotel despite her protests. How inconsiderate!
2. **”*****Girls that look like you don’t study medicine. Girls like you become supermodels!”***   
   I guess you haven’t met too many girls then, huh bud. Three cheers for ignorance!!!
3. ***He threatens to jump off a bridge just because Cindy didn’t want to talk to him while she was upset***                                                                                                                                                      Seriously?! If you can’t see how this is problematic, then you’re just as bad as he is!
4. He bitches and moans at the fact that Cindy was rejecting his attempts to seduce her.      
 Okay, maybe I’m a bit naive to sexual relationships since I am a virgin.....but wouldn’t the more reasonable thing to do would be to communicate with her to see why she‘s rejecting him? I mean, she could have been going through some shit and he never would have known. 
5. He got Cindy fired because of his own impulsivity 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, he’s not conpletely irredeemable. He was willing to raise a child that wasn’t his and seemed like a kind and devoted father. However, all the other stuff listed above just made me want to reach into the screen and smack him because there are too many inconsiderate and emotionally unintelligent people like him of both genders out there.",41,1585269765,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpncn5/who_is_your_most_hated_movie_character_in_cinema/,movies,1

fpmrro,mranimal2,Movies that made you realize movies had changed,"Are there any movies you watched that made you realize an aspect of movies (plot/characters/cinematography/box office/etc.) have changed?

Zootopia grossing a billion dollars made me realize grossing a billion dollars is nothing special anymore.

Back in the 90's and 00's, it was always the biggest movies that had huge pop culture impacts that grossed a billion and more. Yet Zootopia didn't have a big pop culture impact. In fact it's still considered only cool to like it if you're a furry or a child! It just shows that any movie can now gross a billion dollars as long as it's part of a franchise or it's from a big studio or whatnot.

Granted Zootopia isn't the first movie to gross a billion dollars without being a pop culture phenomenon like Frozen or Titanic but it is the first that wasn't really part of a franchise unless you count the WDAS films as their own franchise. Even Alice in Wonderland 2010, which also didn't make much of an impact despite how much it grossed, was based on an extremely well-known children's book and had not only Disney but Tim Burton and Johnny Depp backing it. Zootopia is an ""original movie"" whose only connection to anything famous is being produced by Disney. Yet, despite the lack of brand name and it not being a huge pop culture phenomenon, it still managed to gross a billion dollars, which just showed that being in the billion-dollar club no longer matters.

I mean, even Disney didn't seem to care, as they have hardly produced anything for it, and the majority of the things they have produced for it, including its own world in one of the Disney parks, has been in Asia. I guess it was a bigger phenomenon there than it was in the rest of the world!

fpl9gi,Lochltar,Lady and the Tramp [Opinion] [Spoiler alert],"Stop here if you didn't seen it yet as I am gonna spoil BIG TIME.


Well I will be straight as I don't have much time.

First  of all I was waiting for this movie seen announcement.

They kept the most iconic scene intact which us the Italian restaurant scene by scene...Superbe.

The rat scene with the baby is fantastic too.

Some another scene where there but that's all pretty much.

However...HOWEVER this was a utter disgrace in my eyes :
The Scottish highlands terruer gas become a lady. As much I don't mind usually this kind of change on this one it took off the charm of the old grandad neighbour's knowing each other from a long time.

The siamese cats have been taking off to be replace by generic cats without charisma and on top of that they didn't keep the iconic chinese tune...that's put right off and one massive lowdown. 

No puppies at the ending...seriously what the fuck ?!

Snuffy end scene scrapped off too.

Etc. 

So by taking off these iconic scenes they missed the opportunity to create a fantastic nostalgic experience.

Overall is a good movie but could have been perfect if they didn't change key scenes from the original movie.

At the end it will leave you with a feeling of bitterness for ruining athus wonderful memory from childhood and that a shame.",1,1585262109,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpl9gi/lady_and_the_tramp_opinion_spoiler_alert/,movies,1

A New Hope is literally the introduction to this universe, and the world building expands from there. The original trilogy is like that first appetizer at a nice restaurant: it’s straightforward, simple and delicious, comes with an iced beverage, you can’t go wrong. Then the prequels are the main course but you were the one brave enough to order the one thing nobody orders because it’s the chef’s bizarre special. It’s presentation, while fancy and good in parts, is overly decorated with unnecessary spices and toppings that just make for an overall disappointing experience. And finally, the sequels are the dessert that you don’t know if you want but you hope it will save the bad taste left in your mouth from the main course. It kinda does, the taste is familiar and it makes you think of that initial appetizer... but then you find a chunk of something from the kitchen in it. It looks like some kind of meat but you can’t be sure, all you know is it doesn’t belong in your dessert. You eat around it as much as you can but the dessert is pretty much ruined for you even though it was on the right track at first.

Sure, it’s nowhere nearly as good as Skyfall especially as it’s a direct follow-up, but I’ve always liked it. I love the action and cinematography, it features one of the best cold opens to any Bond movie, I don’t even mind Sam Smith’s song I think it’s highly underrated. 
And the plot I don’t even think is all that bad, I like the slow buildup to revealing Christoph Waltz is Blowfeld and I don’t think it’s that bad that he’s the “author to all his pain” I think that’s a pretty cool way to tie him in to this era. I also love Madelaine Swan played by Léa Seydoux, I think she’s one of the best Bond Girls yet.

A movie about two scientists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) who create human DNA and splice it with animal genes and from it, they generate a mutated human being. The female scientist sees her creation as her child but she's hardly mother dearest and the male scientist, her personal partner as well, becomes a bit too enamorated with their adopted daughter when she quickly grows up.

Their pet/child is a sensitive soul who yearns for companionship but can be quite lethal at the most unexpected times and when mom is a frigid bitch and dad is a sleazy perv, you know this family arrangement is going to get deadly. 

It's very Greek Tragedy in a bizarre way but also fascinating to watch and it gets pretty suspenseful and scary. If you liked Ginger Snaps, this is kind of in the same vein.",5,1585255580,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpjbf3/splice_2009_the_fly_meets_gone_girl_vincenzo/,movies,2

fpixl3,GombaPorkolt,"Looking for a movie set in WWII Japan, any ideas (description below)","So I've watched this movie halfway through with my cousin back in the day, at least 8 years ago. It was about (I think, although the memory is fuzzy) the American attack on a Japanese group of islands (and maybe even the mainland?) from the Japanese perspective.

The setting was obviously the second World War and, IIRC it depicted the inner struggles of Japanese generals/soldiers during the attack/preparation, although I might be wrong here.

&amp;#x200B;

The movie itself was 240 minutes long (I remember it because of how shocked I was when I looked at the timeline in the video player) and sadly we could not finish it before I had to go home, then I completely forgot about it. The memory resurfaced some weeks later, but I cannot for the life of me remember so mach as a word from the title.

Does any of you know which movie I'm talking about? Again, I'm sorry for the fuzzy description, but this is the only thing I remember about it.

In addition to their other genres, I added ""epic"" to the category sections of: Parasite, City of God, and Insterstellar. I don't know why I did this - I think because they are just so...grand?

fpgo8o,juicestain_,TMNT (1990) is actually an insightful look at what it's like to grow up in an immigrant family,"So, i just rewatched TMNT (1990) on Netflix and had two epiphanies: one is that it may be one of the **most underrated superhero films of all time.** The cinematography is stark, beautiful, and a perfect depiction of 90's New York, the character designs are timeless and iconic in today's CGI filled landscape, and it blends disparate emotional tones perfectly. 

The second - and for me, more significant - epiphany was: this movie actually has something to say. In fact, **the entire movie is a remarkably deep metaphor for the immigrant experience in America.** 

&amp;#x200B;

So let's get into it. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, the cinematography.  

There are shots in this film that have stuck with me for over 30 years, and still blow my mind today. I mean, *just look at this:* 

&amp;#x200B;

[My favorite shot in the entire movie](https://preview.redd.it/th00rba452p41.png?width=1267&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d092d5cdb287e151c849b9c3cce034a522267bea)

&amp;#x200B;

TMNT captured a vision of 90s New York that was grounded, enthralling and undiluted. It embraced the energy of the city, the diversity of its citizens, and the raw edges hiding in plain sight. It was grounded, stark, and bold; it was gritty before gritty was even a thing. 

But even more impressive, it managed to blend that aesthetic with characters and a story that are the definition of 90s comic book zaniness, and it did so without either element feeling out of place. The Turtles are presented first and foremost as *true New Yorkers*. Despite being giant mutants, they grew up in the city, and they're heavily influenced by everything from its culture, people, slang, and food. All of that comes through in the cinematography, which I think is why it feels so organic and appropriate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, let's talk about tone. 

This movie is genuinely affecting without ever feeling emotionally manipulative. That is a VERY difficult feat to achieve in a movie about adolescent mutant turtles who love pizza and live in the sewer with their adoptive rat father. BTW, it's also hilarious. The personalities of each turtle shine through and add an amazing sense of levity to a story that gets pretty freaking dark at points. 

But TMNT shows us a real family. It gives emotional depth to its characters. The farmhouse sequence is a great example of this. In it, we see different ways teenagers would cope with grief, or familial trauma. Some, like Donatello would latch on to friends to avoid dealing directly with it. Others, like Leo, might become consumed by guilt, feeling like they drove their own brother away. These are quiet, *human* moments you rarely see in superhero movies. Seeing Mikey - the relentlessly silly class clown - silently weeping at the sight of Splinter, is a truly earned moment. It rings true because the turtles have depth and we've seen how strong the familial bond is between them. 

But it's more than just the emotional moments where we see this. What I love about this movie is how ""lived-in"" and natural they made the turtles' relationship feel. From Donny and Mikey instantly sensing a Leo and Raph fight before it happens, to Rapp rolling his eyes at yet another rendition of Mikey's Cagney impression, they truly feel like a family - one with dysfunctions, just like any other family, but also one with a deep sense of love, loyalty, and devotion. 

**Which brings me to my favorite thing about this movie - it's actually about an immigrant family learning to build a life in America while holding on to their own culture.** 

Stay with me here. Was I on mushrooms when I had this epiphany? Maybe. Can I back it up? Let's see. 

I think Splinter and the Turtles are a perfect metaphor for what it's like to be an immigrant family in America - the feeling of being caught between two worlds and trying to find your identity within that. 

I'm Korean but I was born in Canada. My entire life, I've felt caught between my family's culture and the Canadian culture I lived in. There was always a constant push and pull between opposing values, traditions, behaviors, language, food, etc. My family didn't want us to lose our heritage, but as a kid / teen, I just wanted to fit in with my Canadian friends. That made it hard to find an identity. Who I was with my family wasn't always who I was with my friends. Finding that balance has been a life-long challenge, and I don't think I've found it yet. 

But rewatching TMNT as a 33 year old, I instantly recognized that same struggle in the Turtles. The Turtles are caught between the culture that Splinter raised them in, and the American culture they live in. It's represented as two different worlds, and Splinter's worry that the outside world could never accept the turtles for who they are echoes the concerns my own parents had about me and my brothers being able to fit in with friends that grew up in Canada. 

The Turtles are caught in the middle - one the one hand they have their family, on the other, they have a burning (and understandable) desire to be regular teenagers that are part of the world outside the sewers. They want to have fun, meet people, skateboard, and eat pizza. But it's not that simple for them. Their identity is not as easy to establish because of the two cultures that define it. I know that feeling all too well. Remember the scene when Casey Jones and Raph first meet? When Casey leaves, he calls Raph a freak and Raph explodes.  It's clear that word cut deep with Raph because he's hyper aware of just how different he is than everyone else around him. When I was called ""chink"" as a kid, it hurt the same way. Those are moments when it's made abundantly clear that you are seen as different. 

IMO, Shredder represents Splinter's worldview taken to the extreme. Whereas Splinter tries to protect his family from perceived culture clashes, Shredder looks to dominate that clash instead. He rejects the outside world, looking at them as the enemy. He doesn't try to connect with a new culture, he isolates himself and tries to recreate a vision of the old world he knew. 

Splinter and the Turtles defeating Shredder in battle is a metaphor for them rejecting Shredder's worldview. Their immigrant experience will be one of integration, communication, and friendships (like April and Casey Jones). 

In that sense, I think TMNT has a lot more in common with films like The Farewell and American Factory that it does other superhero films. It's an examination of what it's like to be caught between two different cultures, and how you create your identity through that. I'd recommend a double feature or triple feature with those two films, both are insanely good as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, that's my two cents on TMNT. Would love to know what y'all think.

1) Cinemas will start to open by late May early June. People will slowly come to theaters

2) Wonder Woman 1984 will make a lot of money in the theaters

3) TeNet will get postponed to November or December. It will be a major contender for the Academy Awards in 2021

4) The Toronto International Film Festival gets postponed from September to Late October or even November

5) Streaming Service Movies would do better than last year but do not win Best Picture

6) The Oscars 2021 get postponed to March or even April . It is scheduled to be on February 23 2020.

7) The Eternals will not be as critically well liked compared to other Marvel Films. The film will be divisive among critics and fans

8) No Time to Die will do very well financially and critically giving Daniel Craig the perfect farewell for Bond

9) A Quiet Place 2 will not make as much money as its predecessor

10) MiNari will probably be a contender for Best Picture in 2021 but will not win the Oscars

fpeort,TheBokaBreeze,‘Anchor Zone’ (1994) ~ extremely rare Newfoundland dystopian SciFi feature ~ the most expensive Newfoundland film ever produced,"This is not only the largest budgeted Newfoundland film ever, but simply one of the greatest science fiction films of the 1990s.  What *Anchor Zone* is able to accomplish on such a relatively conservative budget is nothing short of astounding.  An absolutely fascinating piece of Canuxploitation history, and perhaps the highest quality Canuxploitation film.  With a larger budget and/or a wider release, the masses would be heralding this shimmering, highly inventive gem for the cult classic that it is.  This is the sort of outsider SciFi film that true cinephiles dream of discovering

*Anchor Zone* was to be the feature film that would place Newfoundland on the map as not only a desirable shooting location for bigger budget pictures, but as a viable cinematic force in it’s own right.   But alas, it was not meant to be.  Thankfully, we got *Anchor Zone* out of it

Due to its success, it became one of the greatest animated if not best movie trilogies in quite some time. Personally, Aside from the first Shrek film, this is probably my favorite Dreamworks film. While some may argue it's not the best-animated film from the past decade, it was the one animated film that helped jumpstarted the era of great animated films in the 2010s. While the animation and effects are amazing, the 3D is another element that deserves praise as well. Looking back at my experience watching the film, I learned that it's best to be friends with things even if they look terrifying to others.

So I was totally without expectations... and TBH, I found the movie rather angering. I didn't see it as a happy ending whatsoever that this girl has been driven to insanity. And yes, the boyfriend was an ass, but he was also brainwashed at the end there by the villagers, his cheating on her was manipulated by the village to break the girl into joining them. That kind of ruins the whole idea of this being a metaphor for female liberation and all that (which is a take I was completely taken aback by when I was told it later, and only made me even more irritated at the movie for putting on an 'empowering' facade)",43,1585238318,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpdyq7/i_feel_like_im_alone_in_thinking_midsommar_was/,movies,0

fpdbzh,spooffake,Inviting discussion on some fantastic treasure adventure or suspense movies for a greater cause,"
I am staying at home like several others, and looking for some fruitful discussion with this awesome community on fairly new movies (not old era hence year 2000 onwards) in genre like treasure adventure and amazing twist movies. No horror :-)

Background: I am a data analyst.
Reasoning: as below.

There are plenty of enthusiasts who would like to participate in such discussions to watch or share their insights on what they think is one of the best movie creations across various genres. With some useful inputs from the community, we can Shortlist and potentially rank some Great to get some recommendations! Like Top 10 or Top 50 movies per this awesome reddit community. I am gonna start with 2 genres.
The IMDB lists are usually not useful as such and various website have their own lists curated by a few minds only. With this initiative, you will just write a simple input i.e.

My best treasure adventure movie is: &lt;your movie&gt;
My best amazing twist movie is: &lt;your movie&gt;

I will do the rest by crunching the data and provide you will a useful recommendation.

This is obviously my first attempt of the experiment with this large community but if this succeeds and people find it useful, we can do this more often with other genres.

fpbbr3,Just36words,Godzilla Series Review Part 2: Godzilla Raids Again &amp; King Kong vs. Godzilla,"Hey guys we are back again for Part 2 of some of the best king of the monster action. Sorry this is so long, but I hope it'll be worth it.

If you are unfamiliar with what these posts are going to be about, [take a quick glance at my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fnn8i6/lets_talk_about_godzilla_king_of_the_monsters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) where we saw the awesome debut of the King of the [Kaiju](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiju).

Today, we are looking at the next two films in the series: Godzilla Raids Again &amp; Godzilla vs. King Kong

But first, quickly, let me go back over the purpose of this series: Reddit has woefully little in terms of discussion and reviews of some classic monster movies. And there is none more classic than Gojira.

I am not qualified to be a film critic. Not even close. Im going to be looking at this film collection with an optimistic view, not ignoring the bad parts, [there will be some.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfDPnQWiCqU) But celebrating and looking at it from a casual fan point of view. Hopefully these fun reviews will convince you to watch some of these. If not, you’ll come away knowing a little more about Godzilla. Without further ado,

# [Godzilla Raids Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOo0CstvnM4)

[Where to watch it](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/godzilla-raids-again)

I don’t think they expected the first Godzilla to do as well as it did which is why they killed Godzilla at the end of the first movie, but Big Boy’s back!

If my overview doesn’t do it for you, you can just check out the [plot on wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_Raids_Again#Plot) and itll give you the same idea.

**Overview:**

So we start out with two guys in planes spotting fish for their fishing boats as part of some company. One of the pilots is a little horndog flirting with the boss’s daughter on the radio communicator. One of the pilots has very inconvenient engine trouble and has to make an emergency landing on a deserted island.

The other pilot goes to rescue him, and you know, instead of immediately getting back on the good plane and heading back to Japan, like normal, non-monster movie people, these two kaiju baits decide to just chill on the island for a while and build a fire. You know what that means.

That’s right. Monsters show up. The two pilots spot Godzilla fighting some unknown monster behind some conveniently placed rocks to hide most of the battle, but they are going at it.

You get a very brief, but heated battle between Godzilla and some ankylosaur-like looking fucker and they both fall into the ocean. Pilots finally get the idea to dip and we go back to Japan where the pilots look through an old-timey dinosaur book and spot what looks like the result if a turtle and porcupine had sex: an ankylosaurus or Anguirus for this movie. A scientist describes what most certainly is not in any way an ankylosaurus and the resident expert tells the panel of government officials they’re all fucked.

The Defense Force tries to track Godzilla and we get some character building for the pilot and boss’s daughter mentioned earlier. They’re out dancing but suddenly a report comes in saying Godzilla is coming their way which causes a stampede. Everybody flipping out, understandably too, after how Tokyo was destroyed in the first movie.

We get out first look of the new Godzilla, [buckteeth and all](https://imgur.com/gallery/807ku3H). As Godzilla comes ashore, planes deploy flairs to distract and lure Godzilla back out to the ocean like he’s [some kind of Mothra](https://imgur.com/a/TkMF1p1). And it actually works!

That is, until some prisoners decide to do some movie prisoner shit and break out of a transport car running like the 3 stooges. They hijack a tanker truck and we get a crash of a toy car into an oil refinery. The resulting fire attracts Godzilla BACK to shore and we get some toy tanks and missile launchers firing at Godzilla.

Anguirus follows Godzilla to shore like a lost puppy and the two battle it out again on the docks

You get some monster wrestling action which at some points looks kind of awkward and they speed it up to a very noticeable degree to where the two kaiju move absurdly fast to the point its comical.

At 43:40 in the movie we get one of the most hilarious scenes to me. These escaped prisoners got to get their comeuppance. They escape into the subway, but the two monsters fighting crushes the subway and water floods it. The prisoners try to escape but, they just….disappear. fade to nothing as water starts to overtake them. [Hilarious shit.](https://imgur.com/gallery/XPaXjSX)

The battle comes to a climax when Godzilla throws Anguirus through an old style Japanese mansion the size of them and bites Anguirus’s neck, killing him Brutally!

Then, like a G, the king lights the dead body on fire with his atomic breath. A last FU to that dinosaur. Then Godzilla just leaves.

The humans track Godzilla to the Arctic(?) and proceed to bomb the ever living fuck out of the place to try and kill him. But bombs don’t do shit against our boy. So they decide to cause an avalanche and trap Godzilla in ice until…they wake him. When they need him. FOR THE SEQUEL

**Plot: 5/10**

Another straightforward plot, easy to follow. Monsters show up, monsters fight. One monster wins. Humans trap other monster. Short and sweet. But it isn’t that engaging either. You don’t get that horror feeling like the first.

**Characters: 4/10**

Unlike the first movie, the characters, had very little to do and did very little to impact the story, besides spotting Godzilla and a heroic sacrifice at the end. They didn’t even serve as a good outlet to empathize with in the aftermath of the destruction. The stay upbeat even after destruction. But they are likeable and they aren’t annoying. ( I know I bring that up a lot, but just you wait.)

**Monsters:7/10**

Godzilla still looks pretty good, and despite them trying to convince me its an ankylosaurus, ITS NOT A DAMN ANYLOSAURUS. Still, I liked the design of the monsters pretty good. They’re not too goofy looking, but still monsterish and believable.

**Monster Fights: 6/10**

I am usually not a fan of less is more. But in this case, the monster fights seemed better when they were partially skewed from view or from a distance and when they moved slower. There should have been a little bit less of direct focus on the fight. Now, it is funny and worth watching for the sped up parts. You wont find anything like that in other Godzilla films.

**Enjoyability Factor: 5.5/10**

This one is kind of a letdown after the first movie. This movie is kind of an inbetween. Its not the goofy B movie vibes type yet that is fun to watch for its ridiculousness, but its definitely not the horror monster film of the first. You could probably skip this movie and wont miss a whole lot. There’ll be better and worse movies (for better or worse). There just wasn’t a lot of a musical accompaniment in this movie, and it really hurt the vibe. No Godzilla theme. No music during fights.

# [Godzilla vs. King Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljLQZXOUNjw)

I FREAKIN LOVE THIS MOVIE

If you don’t want my long winded overview of this movie, [this short plot on wiki will help](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_vs._Godzilla#Plot)

**Overview: (this is going to be long yall, I want to do it justice)**

This one is actually in English with some dubs and intercuts, but that’s fine with me. You can really tell the American touch on this movie. We start out with typical American Sci Fi white guy in a news room like place where they’re talking about some earthquakes in Chile with other reporters through a satellite that looks like a roulette wheel *in space….*

Anyways, they talk about some super miracle berry and cut away to some dubbed Japanese businessmen talking about pharmaceuticals and tv shows for some reasons, anyway, they decide to capture this giant monster on the island where these berries grow. Lot of exposition in the first few minutes. Lets recap important points so far:

**Miracle cure berries grow on this primitive island**

**Theres this giant unknown monster that lives there**

**The locals use the berries to keep the monster sedated.**

**Some Japanese businessmen decide to capture the monster because……idk**

Alright, lets move forward, shit gets wild. This submarine is investigating water currents close to japan when it crashes into an iceberg. Like, how did they not see the iceberg coming? You’re sailing in a sea of icebegs, look where youre going!

Anyways, these fucking idiots crash into the iceberg with Godzilla trapped inside and release him and now he’s heading to Japan to fuck shit up. Godzilla comes ashore and destroys a toy army base, with toy tanks and everything, doesn’t look too bad though, honestly.

A Japanese ship with those businessman comes to the island with the magic berries and the natives are doing some weird ritual stuff. The Japanese guy gets captures and theres a LOT of blackface going on. But they’re Japanese actors so I don’t think its racist. The Japanese guys just start giving out cigarettes like candy, even to the kids. A storm starts and the natives start freaking out and praying and we hear the monster roar from over the mountains.

Cut to two women. One decides to go Hokkaido. Immediately cut to a news reporter saying: “Please do not go to Hokkaido” funny shit.

Cut back to the news room with Sci Fi the White Guy giving us even more exposition where some dildo tries to explain Godzilla is a cross between a T Rex and a stegosaurus.

Back to the native’s island where the Japanese businessman try to locate the monster while one’s talking about his fucking corns. Later on, one of them gets injured…somehow and we get a giant octopus destroying miniature huts

Amazing scene right here. It’s a real fucking octopus they project on a screen, out of water, while natives throw spears at the screen. Then they use horrendous looking CGI style stuff to make it look like a tentacle grabbed a native. Its funny as shit dude you got to watch this movie just for this. Then King Kong finally shows up and runs the octopus off, throwing rocks and huts at the screen and even having a fake octopus latch on his head. Kong decides to get drunk on the berry juice after he runs the octopus off and passes out.

And lets talk about Kong. [This is one goofy looking bitch.](https://imgur.com/gallery/X69cKgV) I mean he looks sort of like the abominable snowman from Rudolph. Looks like a giant orangutan with down syndrome.

Back to Sci Fi the White Guy. Godzilla has disappeared and has the brain the size of a marble. Back to you, Kong!

Who knew, you cant just capture a giant animal and claim you own him? The Japanese government orders hungover Kong back to Ferro Island while they are on their way back to Japan with Kong still sleeping it off on a raft.

Remember those two women from earlier? Yeah I don’t really either. Well, the one of them is in Hokkaido and guess who knows up? That’s right, Godzilla! He destroys the train shes on, and she has to make the worst escape possible. This bitch completely forgets how walking and running works. She doesn’t even evacuate with the other people, she runs right off to a fucking river, falling every 2 seconds. Literally. Somebody injected horse tranquilizers into her legs. SOME-FUCKING-HOW her boyfriend finds her in the middle of river and rescues her.

Back with Kong, apparently Kong eventually waking up never even crossed their minds, but no hangover lasts forever. They try to blow Kong up with Dynamite but Kong also like a honey badger, he don’t give a shit. Kong escapes and heads for Tokyo.

**ROUND 1. FIGHT!**

Godzilla and Kong meet for their first fight. Godzilla takes a hill because he’s no dumb dumb, [he has the high ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8wLBOlCKPU). Kong is pissed about it and starts chunking rocks at Godzilla while Godzilla flails his arms and sets everything on fire. [Kong gets burned and looks like hes been shot. Godzilla flexes on him, and Kong says, oh fuck im outta here…](https://imgur.com/gallery/0TTlhiU)

**Winner: GODZILLA**

Humans decide to lay a trap for Godzilla, making him fall into a hole and then blow up the hole. But that don’t do jack shit either.

But where as well all know, its common knowledge, reptiles are weak to electricity, Kong gathers strength from electricity….yes. that’s part of the movie. Godzilla tries to go around some power lines while we see Kong running like a fat kid chasing an ice cream truck into power lines and just fucking eats electricity.

Kong now enters Tokyo. He picks up a train and kidnaps a girl because Kong always has to kidnap a girl and climbs the highest building in Japan. A building no taller than he is. She’s apparently the sister of one those businessman, which I would have never had any clue if they didn’t say it outright. They cant shoot Kong without hurting the girl, so whats the army to do? Get Kong Hammered! How convenient they had some of that juice available to put into rockets and shoot them at Kong to get him drunk.

Kong passes out like a freshman and they rescue the girl.

The only way to stop the monsters Is to make them fight. They decide to air Lyft Kong to wherever Godzilla wandered off to and hopefully they’ll kill each other.

**Round 2. Fight!**

Kong gets a preemptive attack when the humans just drop him on a mountain and he rolls into Godzilla. They both tumble around for a while like some tumbleweeds or shit. Kong then tries a sneak attack and hides and waits to try and sneak up on Godzilla and grab his tail. Doesn’t really work out though. This Godzilla Thicc. He throws Kong off with his tail. Kong tries Rock Throw again. But Godzilla is ready this time and uses his tail as a bat and knocks the rocks back into Kong.

Kong gets pissed and tackles Godzilla and they tumble some more. After some good ground and pound by Kong, he tries to use his agility to his advantage. Monkeys are pretty dexterous and agile right? Not this fucking monkey. Kong tries to roll, but just fucking face plants into some rocks and knocks himself out. no joke.

Oh no! Godzilla tries some CPR with his tail to save King Kong and it works and Kong suddenly awakens like a meth head on cough syrup restocking day and gets fucking dropkicked by Godzilla.

Kong gets knocked out again, but luckily gets struck by lightning, because why the hell not and gets a power boost!

[Kong reminds Godzilla to eat his vegetables](https://imgur.com/gallery/ThP22De) then judo flips the giant lizard into some buildings. Kong is just exuding electricity, literally, at this point. He’s built up a lot of static I guess.

The two destroy one more beautiful antique mansion before both falling off a cliff into the ocean which triggers a massive earthquake for some reason that destroys part of the island.

In the distance the human observers see Kong swimming off back to his island.

**Winner: KONG? MAYBE. I GUESS? BY TKO**

**Plot: 7.5/10**

It’s a little complicated in the beginning but once the ball gets rolling with our two main stars, it becomes simple enough. Its nothing too amazing or too dumb. It’s a nice in the middle, which is perfect for a monster movie.

**Characters: 6/10**

This was actually a hard one. I don’t remember a single characters name. they weren’t really important individually. However, they do provide some hilarious moments, such as the corn guy. The dialogue gets cheesy as hell sometimes, which I love for this, it fits into the tone of this movie and adds, instead of detracting from the overall. However, there are no character arcs and the humans are not really important overall to know them, just what theyre doing.

**Monsters: 7/10**

Godzilla didn’t look too bad. More reptilian and lizard like in this movie with some thicc thighs. Im not lying. Go check them out. just damn Godzilla, he been doing squats. King Kong on the other hand looks the abominable snowman costume from Rudolph went [10 cycles in the dryer](https://imgur.com/gallery/ejwwNWy). But it just adds to the cheesiness too.

**Monster Fights: 10/10**

The fights are really good. Even though you lose a sense of scale of the monsters when they are together, when they individually destroy shit, you get a sense of their power and size, which makes it better when they are on a deserted, featureless mountain fighting.

The fights are worlds above choreographed better than the last movie and are actually really fun to watch with badass moments and hilarious moments in as well but it doesn’t break the feel of the situation, it melds together and all feels appropriate.

**Enjoyability Factor: 11/10**

This rating may not seem to mesh with the others but I don’t care. Watch this movie. Get some friends (oh shit. Maybe not now but later) have some beers and watch this. You wont regret it. It is cheesy, fun to follow along, not so bad its good like Sharknado, but so cheesy its good.

The characters are funny. The fights are actually good with funny moments. The effects and costumes are a must see. Just watch it. You wont regret. I cannot recommend it enough.",2,1585228642,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fpbbr3/godzilla_series_review_part_2_godzilla_raids/,movies,1

This is what I can remember..
An elderly Asian man brings a travelling carnival/freakshow to a small town and the townspeople have different experiences with each of the shows. One scene I remember in particular is with Pan. Another is before the show opens the Asian man is going around putting fliers up but uses nails and spits them or uses his fingers? Ahhh I know that sounds a little odd but it's what I remember..

The title was something like Seven Sins of Doctor ______... or dr ______ and the seven sins... 
I tried whatsmymovie.com and didn't get anything on there.

It's based on a true story, so there is almost certainly an economic or financial issue I don't understand, but I don't see how this 'pay as you go' scheme at all helps with his fears.

fp9u0j,ChrisEvansFan,"To everyone who recommended A SILENT VOICE, thank you 🙏","I saw it last night and goodness the feels!!! What a beautiful movie. Im saddened to hear (read) that the animation studio that made this is the one that got burned down. So it has that kind of melancholy air about it.

I like how this movie is so subtle. You get to pick up some things along the way. Like how the girl hates herself/her disability by constantly apologising. 

&gt;!spoiler That balcony scene where she is about to commit suicide is so beautifully done. The suspense! The desperation from Ishida calling out her name. Him sacrificing himself instead! 😭

Then after this scene is so heart wrenching where Nishimaya is saying sorry to the mom! Legit tears man!!!!

The two protagonists have that connection in which it seems like they cant get over the fact that they are the reason that makes the other miserable. Ishida bullying her before;  Nishimaya causing his almost death by saving her. But the bittersweet part is, neither of them really blame the other? So in turn it is like they are each other’s half? !&lt;

I like Your Name more because Im a romantic sap of believing in destinies and stuff. But I think A Silent Voice has a deeper emotional impact which shows how social anxiety and bullying affects you. 

So thank you to everyone who has recommended me this beautiful movie! 

Next on my list is Weathering With You ;)",12,1585221621,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp9u0j/to_everyone_who_recommended_a_silent_voice_thank/,movies,1

Both women undress and lie utterly motionless, on their backs, with their head at the foot of the bed. 

I understand that with the parents, it is something resembling an anesthesiology fetish. But dear god, the daughter acts in the exact way her father fetishizes. Does this somehow imply that he was abusing her and trained her to satisfy his fetish?

Shit begins to malfunction, and he always locks his room door before going to bed and one day he woke up and it was open.

fp71mc,PartyOnAlec,"[Recommendation] Blinded By The Light (2019) - a unity cry not just for Springsteen fans, but for the working class, the ostracized, the underprivileged, and those still discovering themselves.","Watching this movie made me feel the most hopeful and uplifted that I've been in the last several weeks. It's a story of perserverence, a balancing of traditional and progressive cultures, tolerance and acceptance, and the feeling you get when a piece of art resonates with you down to the bone.

Of course the soundtrack is on point, and has plenty of hits as well as a couple rare, b-side, and unreleased Springsteen songs. The film has all the vibrance of a musical without really belonging to the format. I typically don't like musicals, but I loved this because I understand that feeling of frisson - when a song seems to float at the exact wavelength as your soul.

The editing was excellent. Well framed shots and long takes with subtly-but-perfectly coordinated camera and actor movement. Post effects are great too with the lyrics moving around the actor and across the scenery. Lots of practical effects done using time dilation and projection mapping.

The movie was a ""feel-good"" movie, but had real stakes. It mostly follows a Pakistani youth in England, balancing his desire to become his own person, his father's (and culture's) expectations of him, and the varying temperature of cultural reaction to his being there.

Anyway, I've had wine and that this followed a format at all is kinda impressive. If you enjoy Springsteen, you will freaking love this - so much so it will reinvigorate that passion for The Boss. If you're indifferent to Springsteen, then this is a great story that will get you psyched about music. If you're critical of Bruce, well hell we got a lot to talk about, but I truly believe this music is enjoyable for the character development and self-discovery enough to outweigh any negativity surrounding Springsteen.

I certify this with my complete recommendation, and understand that my recommendation is essentially a guarantee.",2,1585206254,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp71mc/recommendation_blinded_by_the_light_2019_a_unity/,movies,1

fp60za,TheSonsofBatman,I miss Frank Darabont.,"The Shawshank Redemption is probably one of, if not the greatest film(s) ever made. And if you know the story behind it, Darabont was offered to sell if he had cold feet about directing. But at the end of the day, it worked out and he should have been making movies consistently. 

I loved Green Mile, and even The Majestic. The Mist took me by surprised and I didn't know he did it until I saw the ending. 

I know he stuck with TV and writing but I feel like the world is missing out on a lot of his stuff. I wish he did his Huntsman movie and I'm sure it would have been a pretty exciting take on its own with him trying his hand at a fairy tale. I actually have a conspiracy theory that the actors who signed on (Emily Blunt, Jessica Chastain) were all on board DURING Darabont's attachment to it but couldn't leave. 

I hope he does more stuff.",28,1585200862,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp60za/i_miss_frank_darabont/,movies,1

For the longest time I've been having dreams about this alien movie I watched as a kid. I've been trying to re watch it for ever but I could never remember the title. I brought it up with my sister recently and she was thinking about the same thing.

This is all I remember.

There were these aliens that I remember looking like Daleks, but made of brains or something. I remember it from a scene where this guy saw one on the road. There was another scene I remember clearly where they find the aftermath of an alien attack and all that's left is a brown puddle of muddy stuff. And I also think the setting was in the mid-west like the town in Tremors.

When the characters in a film take on a virtual reality for us, when a character in another film made 30 years later can say “The Godfather” contains all the lessons in life you need to know, when an audience understands why that statement could be made, a film has become a cultural bedrock. No doubt not all of the gospels are equally “good,” but we would not do without any of them.""

He’s probably the most realistic depiction of how sadistic and nasty a bully can be, at least in my opinion. Even though he doesn’t do anything worse than slap kids asses with a paddle it still feels like he’s doing so much worse than that just by his presentation alone.

They eventually escape through some water system or something, and we find out that the city is underground. The so called water system, like many other things, was very large, and made of metal. I remember that the Mayor of the city was trying to stop them.

My memory is not very good, so take the details with a grain of salt. I got serious Mortal Engines and maybe Golden Compass vibes when i watched it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen this movie 3 times now.  There is a still a plot hole to me that bothers me more than it should.  My kids argue with me about it every time, but I still can't get a grip on how it makes sense.  Work with me here for a minute.

Fast forward to later on in the movie when Marta is having dinner with Ransom.  She explains to him that she accidentally gave Harlan too much morphine because she got the vials mixed up.  This is exactly what Ransom was expecting because he changed the solution in the 2 vials.  Ransom also has not seen the toxicology report at this point, so how would Ransom have known that Marta actually gave correct doses to Harlan, because that is not discovered until the very end.  The movie actually says ""At this point Ransom knew his plan had not worked"".  HOW DID HE KNOW THAT?  For all intents and purposes, at this point everything is exactly as Ransom has planned.  This makes no sense and takes us down a path that isn't viable.  

Someone explain to me how Ransom knew at this point his plan had not worked.",6,1585189079,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp3dpr/can_we_talk_about_knives_out/,movies,1

fp34me,frak21,So I think I've come to a realization about American Psycho. Nothing in the film is real. None of it.,"I believe the entire film is the narrative of a fantasy.  The narrator is a sociopath imagining himself as Patrick Bateman (perhaps not even his real name) and expressing in a way he could never attain, his narcissism, feelings of superiority, and desire to kill others.

Although Patrick speaks the language of materialism, it's all for show.  Nothing originates from within Patrick and it all reads like a magazine ad.  We never see him (or anyone else) work at his job, possibly because the narrator fancies Patrick to be a wealthy, attractive, and high powered New York socialite but has no actual experience to draw from.

Patrick himself even states:  ""I simply am not there.""  That's not to indicate that Patrick lacks the empathy characteristic of a psychopath, but that Patrick doesn't exist *at all,* and is just a vehicle for the imaginings of an unseen (and it could be implied unseeable) real world psychopath perhaps in a very different situation.

I'm no film studies scholar, and I'm not even the brightest person around, but it suddenly hit me that rather than trying to decide what parts of the movie were fantasy or hallucination, that the *whole thing* was a fantasy, which is why there is no catharsis for the narrrator in the end.  It was just a sick internal fantasy signifying nothing.  A confession to himself and himself alone. with no basis in reality at all.",14,1585188068,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp34me/so_i_think_ive_come_to_a_realization_about/,movies,1

fp2to9,ParanoidAndroid1087,"What are some examples of actually substantiative, artful Christian/religious Films?","When I, like most filmgoers nowadays, hear the term “Christian film”, I immediately think of the ham-fisted schlock such as God’s Not Dead.

In spite of this, I’m curious to hear as to whether there are examples of Christian films that actually possess some degree of merit and are worth checking out. I’m going to leave the definition of “Christian film” intentionally vague, meaning that it could be a film that is favorable towards Christianity and/or biographical (The Passion of The Christ), or something that attempts contemplate at some more weightier themes without being entirely entrusted in, and oftentimes skeptical, of the concept of God as well as many of the Christian beliefs (The Seventh Seal, Silence). 

I guess this question could warrant an exploration of religious movies in general, but for this post I was just curious as to whether there are many quality Christian films out there in spite of the artless trash that is more we’ll-recognized by the public.",32,1585186847,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/fp2to9/what_are_some_examples_of_actually_substantiative/,movies,1
