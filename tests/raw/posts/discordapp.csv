fso2xy,MightyRez,[FIX] Stream Elgato Capture Card on Discord (fully working),"I've seen many threads of people having problems trying to **Discord Stream** their **Elgato capture software**.  
Some people end up with video and no audio, some only have a black screen with audio. 

The **fix** to resolve all this:

* Add your Elgato capturing software to your Discord Game Activity   
*Discord Settings &gt; Game Activity &gt; Add it!*
* FULLSCREEN your Elgato software   
*(very imporant)*
* Start your stream in a discord call or voice channel

Now you have working **VIDEO** and **AUDIO!** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Have fun =)**",0,1585697841,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fso2xy/fix_stream_elgato_capture_card_on_discord_fully/,discordapp,2

I stumbled upon a “Zoom raiding” server that clearly states no graphic nudity , porn , curses , slurs or anything illegal. Its all about having fun joining random zoom classes, however to my knowledge i heard from another friend i should leave because i can get terminated for joining raid servers.

I have a Discord server and want a bot that will create a Temp Voice channel AND Text channel. Anyone know any? 

I currently have a bot that if you click the Voice channel, it will auto create a voice channel and move you to it, then it auto delete once everyone has left it. Too many times we get onto a topic of conversation and start to want to send pictures of the related topic. We usually use General Chat to send said pictures, and then purge it after. 

It would be ideal if there was a bot that if you clicked it (such as click here for temp channels), it would create a temp voice and text channel, then auto delete both once everyone has left the voice channel. This way we wouldn't have to spam general or create a group. Any ideas? Does this bot exist?

fsf9ru,sarahhmitchell,"is rythm bot acting weird for anyone else? sorry, the rythm subreddit is locked","i'm almost 99 percent sure this is a prank because of the audio content in question, but just in case it isn't:

the rythm bot in one of my servers started acting weird suddenly. it was jumping between voice channels, and playing sounds that no one asked it to play in any of the channels (the !play command wasn't anywhere). then, when we said !pause, it would pause normally, but when we !play again, it says that rythm isn't currently playing any music.

at first, last night, it was apparently (I wasn't there) playing microwave noises and static. then this morning when I was there, it kept playing static and jumping between channels. when I started accusing the server owners and pointing out how everything could be done with admin perms (moving the bot, making a channel no one else could see to give it commands), it joined the voice channel we were all in and played footsteps, a gun shot, more footsteps, what sounded like a woman bound and gagged and screaming from another room, then more footsteps, and then it paused (but, once again, when i unpaused it, nothing was playing). after it was done i said ""um.. discuss"" to the other people in the channel, but apparently they didn't hear any of the gunshots or screams, and the red mic that shows up when their roles are prevented from hearing a bot weren't there either.

we kicked it and invited it back, and it joined and jumped between voice channels again without being prompted, but so far it hasn't played anything by itself.

on the 1 percent chance this isn't a prank, did anyone else notice anything weird about rythm?",5,1585669706,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fsf9ru/is_rythm_bot_acting_weird_for_anyone_else_sorry/,discordapp,1

fs8juk,wearsshortshorts911,User Volume Extremely Loud—Not Normal,"Individual user volume keeps gaining in Discord, to the point where it is ear splitting. This is not a normal issue that is on the other person’s end, it is on my end. Adjusting individuals does not work when this is happening (almost like the settings are bypassed). In Windows 10 a volume a mixer the app has a bar where the volume is set, when this issue is happening the volume extends far beyond the set volume bar. It’s like the app bypasses all user and system volume settings.

I have tried:
-reinstalling Discord
-updating
-Windows 10/Graphics Updates
-Scanning for Device Changes
-Enabling/Disabling Realtech Sound Drivers
-Switching USB Ports of headset
-Using Legacy Hardware feature on Discord
-Running Discord as Admin

The issue doesn’t happen consistently. It usually happens when I haven’t been on Discord in a few hours. I have to do several things to correct it also, I have to disable and enable the device. Switch the device input/output for discord. Restart Discord. Sometimes restart computer.

I use Razer Kraken USB Headphones (Mic/Audio is through one USB Connection).

Recently, maybe the last 2 weeks, the volume will randomly change.  It will go from normal to sounding like everyone is feeding back on everyone else and the volume also increases.  It's not actually feed back, and it happens when only one is talking or many.  If I let it go, it will eventually stop itself and go back to normal just as randomly as it started.

It doesnt happen for specific people/servers, instead to anyone and on any server.  I know what normal feedback sounds like, and this is not that.

fs18eq,Forever_YoungTV,Ticket reply,"How long does it take to get a reply for ticket?  
I have created a huge server, actually 4 World of Warcraft servers, it took me a lot of hours. During the weekend I started networking and DMing other WoW servers admins. I haven't invited a single person through DM, however I have posted severs on other servers, of course with admins permission. I didn't add that I'm doing this with admin permission so some people might have flagged them. Today I have also joined \~50 other WoW servers to continue my advertising campaign. I believe I haven't broke any ToS rules, I was networking and never advertised anything without getting admins permission.   
What I believe that I've either been flagged by other people from servers because I didn't add ""admin approved add"", or because of joining 50 servers today and triggering automated anti-spam system.   
BTW my servers were published on 1 of WoW news website, I got permissions from multiple server admins, all in several days and so my servers were growing.   
I feel so empty now, and still have a tone to do other jobs, want to plan my days so wondering how long it takes for ticket replies and maybe any suggestions how to lift the ban?",1,1585608890,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fs18eq/ticket_reply/,discordapp,1

I know that a while back, my brother was getting his own discord, and he was using the same email as me, which resulted in the password being changed(I think), since nobody remembers it, now I'm stuck with a password that doesn't work.

My girlfriend joined a server to meet other gamers online and be friends with them etc, and this one guy that messaged her took a very hard liking to her where he constantly spams her and tells her to leave me and be with him instead, shes said multiple times that she does not want to be with him or even friends at this point because of his behavior, shes blocked him but then he comes back with a new account, she even created a new discord but then after that her friends that she readded have reported to her that after she created a new discord that this guy continuously harasses them in the same manner, if he gets blocked he makes a new account and spams them, some have even reported that their significant others are getting spammed by this guy and its just all sorts of crazy right now. Im including a few screenshots she has sent me regarding his behavior, im not sure exactly what can be done at this point but please anything would be a great help.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive made a support ticket for her but im trying to search for all the options i can at this point to help her out, and thought of posting here, she doesn't want to use her own reddit account though because shes worried he might find that and just have another place to stalk her on.

frwe6u,Riskytexts,Infinite Update Loop,"Hey all,

Over the last three months I became plagued with the ""Launching - Failed to Update Retry in X"" error. Finally today because of the fact I've been home due to the Virus going around I decided ""Hey I'll just reinstall the thing"" because for the life of me I couldn't find the issue as to why my discord would always do that on launch.

Well uninstalling it was the worst mistake I could have made. I cleared all my files, both hidden and visible. I completely removed Discord from all traces of my PC and did a fresh install off the main site. Whenever I launch the setup it goes instantly into the ""Launching - Failed to Update Retry in X"". and will not progress further than this.

I have an open support ticket with discord but was hoping maybe someone here has overcome this and solved it. A lot of google searches referenced posts that were 1-2 years old but nothing recent. Aside from the fresh install I tried to update file names in Appdata/local/discord which was a listed solution from a couple years ago.

I am currently getting it zipped and copied from another device that had it to get it back on my computer to hopefully solve it but until then looking for anyone with any solutions as to what is going on.",1,1585593396,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/frwe6u/infinite_update_loop/,discordapp,1

https://i.imgur.com/Dg23P6H.png

The request took around ~250 milliseconds on average every time (with my internet), around the same as the PATCH editing roles endpoint.

frqobp,HopeForFitness,"Server got raided twice, lost all 1k members, Im getting slandered, and doxxed.","&amp;#x200B;

The whole story is 1+ year old, alot of stuff has happend with my server,

so I dont remember everything.

&amp;#x200B;

First we have 3 main folks,

Jeff:Raider,Manipulator.

&amp;#x200B;

Chris:Me,Victim.

&amp;#x200B;

Teemo: He saved the server, but still greedy

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I met Jeff 1 year ago, I believe it was on another server and we just kinda became 

""friends"".

&amp;#x200B;

I trusted him real good, to the point where I gave him Admin on my 1k Memmber discord server.

&amp;#x200B;

I had 3 accounts running the server, the one with ownership I lost acces to,

and other 2 were account I had given highest role admin to incase something like this happend.

Here comes Jeffrey, after I trusted him with Admin, he took control of things real bad.

Everything changed, server name, chat, everything. He was so toxic, and he boasted about

how he hacks shit and such.

Now Teemo on the other side (me and all server members) never liked him, we were always against his shit.

Jeffrey spoke in a very stupid way, he studied the thesaurus,every word he says is something we couldn't understand,

puts a dot in every sentence, he was just weird.

Now Jeffrey takes control of the server, and I was blinded by him.

He was a really good social engineer, he manipulated everyone and what I mean by everyone I mean everyone believed him.

It got to a point where I didn't even mind the damage he has [done.Fast](https://done.Fast) forward 4 months, and the damage he has done was enough to

show his true identity ( cringeworthy but this is all I can come up with ).

This is where Teemo takes place, he was smart, smart enough to use a bot on of our members made ( he had a well-known bot that was higher role by mistake made by me than the highest role

currently active account was in place). He used the bot to give him a role higher than me. This is where he banned jeff and we got rid of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now Jeffrey didnt like that, and he knew something would happen. He had his own raidgroup ready and kicked every 1k member and changed everything to wizzed.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Teemo becomes greedy, doesn't wanna give admin back to me, so the server stays in control of his hands for the next 5-6 months, until I finally can get back on the account

thats a higher role than him,still not ownership tho.

I took away Teemo's admin, and he left the server.

&amp;#x200B;

Fastforward to 3/19/2020. Jeffrey's girlfriend dm's me and told me Jeffrey has been reformed and such. I did not believe her until I personally got into a call with Jeffrey.

I got into a call with him, he kept convincing me he is reformed and he wont do anything to the server but he wants to come back and get admin. I was very hesitated by him,

but as I said, he's a good social engineer, so I got convinved and I gave him admin.

&amp;#x200B;

Beware of this, he is smart, he stayed under the radar for 10 days, until he waited until my internet got booted off (it gets booted off every day at 12 am UK Time ) and started the raid 1-2 AM.

&amp;#x200B;

He banned my OG members, some of them, but not all (we are talking 3 year old members ).This time he was prepared, he SOMEHOW, fucking somehow was able to ban me although I was highest role

and got control of the server and made it his. One of my members, Ali, made a new server, a bunker of such to gather members 30 minutes into the raid because he knew the server was gonna be destroyed.

After he had done this, he kept slandering me and saying I am a pedophile ( his proof was an 11 year old kid I met at the time I made the server who I stayed friends with till he was 14 )

and he released my private info. This is not fucking fair and legal, I already contacted discord about this but no response, yet.

My servers name was Blue Balls, it was a meme joke server, no rules, rarely mutes, toxic-but friendly.

He came, announced Nazi shit, renamed server to Opp and harrased Teemo.

Now what I am doing is sending server invites to my new bunker server, we already gathered 105 members of the 600 we had and we are getting more and making them leave the server.

I want you to report Jeffrey, his brother and his girlfriend if you can.

This is the discord server he has

Jeffrey: Джефри#9999 user id : 385520179901366272

Opp: [https://discord.gg/nf2Y93X](https://discord.gg/nf2Y93X)

My server ( new members r put into quarintine chat until we verify them,. if ur from reddit, say u came fromr eddit and ur verified ) : [https://discord.gg/Hx86eq8](https://discord.gg/Hx86eq8)

He doxxed me, slandered me and ruined everything I mad. Please report him or do anything and help me get back on my feet and I need ownership back to account.

fro4c0,mann1x,How to use IFTTT to receive free games alerts on discord chat via webhooks + email alert,"Seems it's still not well known, so here some info on how to use IFTTT to post search results. It's more convenient that running a discord bot 24h just for that.

There's a limit of 20 posts per check; usually it's enough to catch them all unless someone is spamming.

You need to register at [https://ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com) and create your applets.

There are plenty of applets ready to go if you look on explore; you can adapt them to your needs.

Plenty of guides on Reddit and on the web on how to use it and connect to webhooks, GIYF, eg:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ifttt/comments/agbzn0/reddit\_to\_discord\_webhook\_the\_easy\_way/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ifttt/comments/agbzn0/reddit_to_discord_webhook_the_easy_way/) 

&amp;#x200B;

The most tricky part is how to construct the search string and what to put in the body to get a nice post.

&amp;#x200B;

These are my settings for /r/FreeGameFindings:

**New post from search** 

(title:epic OR itch OR ""\[steam\]"") AND NOT flair:expired subreddit:freegamefindings

And /r/FreeGamesOnSteam:

**New post from search** 

title:\[Steam\] subreddit:freegamesonsteam

&amp;#x200B;

**Body**

{ ""embeds"": \[ { ""title"": ""&lt;&lt;&lt;{{Title}}&gt;&gt;&gt;"", ""url"": ""&lt;&lt;&lt;{{PostURL}}&gt;&gt;&gt;"", ""description"": ""&lt;&lt;&lt;{{Content}}&gt;&gt;&gt;"", ""thumbnail"": { ""url"": ""&lt;&lt;&lt;{{ImageURL}}&gt;&gt;&gt;"" }, ""footer"": { ""icon\_url"": ""[https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png](https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png)"", ""text"": ""/u/&lt;&lt;&lt;{{Author}}&gt;&gt;&gt; | &lt;&lt;&lt;{{PostedAt}}&gt;&gt;&gt;"" } } \] }

&amp;#x200B;

If you connect your email then you can also create just an applet to receive the new posts via mai.

The webhook applet can also notify you via mail via the ""Get notifications when this connection is active"" switch.

frmonv,Craftstal,Discord Voice Chat No Audio,"Ok so this used to only happen if I tried to join a call while in game and even then it was uncommon, but at this point it happens whenever I try to join a call while I have my headphones in, the Corsair HS60 Surround. The issue is that I can hear people very briefly when I join a call, and then all audio cuts off, I can't hear them, they can't hear me.   
Disconnecting and reconnecting rarely works, so I have to disconnect from Discord, disconnect the headphones and then reconnect both, first the call then the headphones, however it's inconsistent at best and brings along a whole sleugh of other issues, like infinitely authenticating or crashing games/Discord. If I am in a call without being in a game and it's working, and I join a game, it has a pretty decent chance of cutting out again.   
To me it seems like it's a weird interaction between Discord and my headphones that I've never had before until recently. It's sort of hard to describe, but it's like it can't handle two different audio sources at once and just stops working. I've also had Discord just break my PCs audio service, but that's a simple fix by just troubleshooting.

We're hosting an online debate and we want to stream the finals of it through some online platform.

We're planning to host the debate itself on Discord. However, it'll be too difficult to get everyone to download and install Discord before the finals.

Is there some way to stream the voice channel where the debate is going to be held through, say, Twitch or Youtube? Weird complex hacks are fine too :)

If we can't find a creative solution, I recommend Discord move from a linear to a branched permissions hierarchy that either uses permissions at nodes, or has branches from the current linear model.

I've gotten pretty comfortable with the linear hierarchical approach to roles where the role above it inherits the roles below except for explicit changes that you designate to the higher role.  Also I understand that the higher role takes presidency over the lower role.  I've set up some cool stuff within categories to keep the permissions related and not intermingle, but what i can't seem to solve and want help with is how I can have someone control roles of only roles specified in the channel or category permissions.  Specific example: There are two categories that need to be locked down to two different groups of gamers (let's say two competing clans).  The clans are independent and neither has a priority over the other and shouldn't be able to see the other clan's private channels, but each clan needs to have their own ability to control membership to their channels.  How can I do this without having to personally micromanage the whole thing.  Micromanaging doesn't scale well to multiple clans, nor does it work when I'm offline.  

Is there a way to give someone the 'manage roles' permission without giving them full permissions to all roles below them?  Do any bots accomplish this already?",0,1585533352,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fri2dv/understanding_advanced_permissions/,discordapp,1

frdymf,Luronius,Discord crashing audio drivers - any updates or fixes for this yet?,"So while this issue has only started occurring for me in the last 3-5 months, upon trying to discover a fix for this issue, I see threads and posts going back years, with the exact same symptoms as I'm experiencing, but little to nothing in the way of fixing it.  
  
To go into more depth with my issue, basically if I'm playing a game, and/or listening to music with discord open, every now and then when I get a discord notification, my sound drivers completely crash, causing all current sounds to stop working, resulting in me having to restart every application that uses sound to get audio back. In the case of a game, the game's performance gradually gets worse and worse until it's unplayable (all while being completely mute).  
  
This however is amplified greatly through using discord's voice channels, and I cannot pin exactly *what* is causing it, other than  someone talking, joining / leaving, notifications, etc - anything that creates audio from the discord app.  
  
I've looked at threads posted to google, and even scoured the threads posted to this subreddit itself dating back a few years with no solutions seemingly found, so I thought I'd ask again if anyone, or the developers, have any answers, resolutions, or something that I can to do temporarily fix / avoid this issue?  
  
Thank you all!  
  
***TL;DR:*** *Sounds coming from Discord crash audio for every open application, resulting in everything needing to be restarted. Performance of a muted game gets gradually worse until unplayable.*  
  
**Edit:** [*Here is a video of said bug, which seemed to be easily produced by simply joining a discord voice channel.

I tried tweaking all the sound settings in app and enabled all macOS system permissions for discord, but nothing seemed to fix it. When I ""test out my microphone"" in app (be it the internal one, or a wired headset, or even a wireless one) it plays back my sound just fine and the camera works too.

It's driving me insane, and no I am not just being pranked by my friends... This happened with everyone. (Two groups of people that don't even know each other)

I have had issues where it wouldn't pick up my mic when I joined a call until I left and re-joined (after initially joining, meaning I would always join-leave-join when I got a call) for weeks, maybe even months. But this one takes it too far...

It would not do it, and crashed.  I thought I would just uninstall the app and re-download it.  I have done everything that online forums have said as far as deleting everthing that deals with discord on my PC after running %appdata% and %appdatalocal%.  I even made sure all of drivers are updated.  Every time I try to now, it gives me an error saying ""Installation has failed"".  I open the setup log, and this is what I get:

Discord channel organization | Discord perms | I am great with all major discord bots | Server security | Community engagement | Event planning | Hiring staff | Polite/good attitude | Being professional

I know you guys are [really busy](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/f5vllo/why_isnt_discord_doing_anything_about_discool/fi2xsn6) with trying to keep [dis.cool](https://dis.cool) from scraping Discord. Recently, the domain has been taken down (I believe on your request?). This has not stopped the owners however, since they simply registered two new domains: [dsc.cool](https://dsc.cool) and [tracr.co](https://tracr.co). 

What is even more worrying is that dis.cool is now actively asking users to [contribute data](https://dsc.cool/contribute/invite) as a way to circumvent the API protections.

I have a few questions to Discord staff:
- Does Discord know the identites of the owners running dsc.cool?
- What further actions are going to be taken against the owners of dis.cool?
- How is Discord going to protect their users from scrapers like dis.cool in the future? (For example by making the API more 'privacy by design')

I would love to hear back from you guys.",2,1585509314,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/frbe8k/questions_about_discooldsccooltracrco/,discordapp,1

frb7w3,TheGlowingTorch,The Fake Twitch Bot Mystery,"**Moderators I see you flagging this post for RULE 6 which I have documented and reported to discord's Trust And Safety team. THIS IS A INFORMATIVE POST.**

Recently a **Discord Bot known as Twitch#8801 has been dming users with this message.**

Edit:

There are several bots; here is a list,

\- **Twitch#8801**

\- **Twitch#9901**

\- **Twitch#5606**

The bot askes you to add itself to your server giving you free access to discord's Nitro Gaming Service.

Now humans are humans and most people on Discord would think this message is legit. My own friends have fallen for this. A server with 30,000 people is now gone. That's not all the damage I know of.

**What does the bot do?**

1. **DM ALL USERS OF THAT DISCORD SERVER**
2. **Prune the server.**
3. **Ban everyone.**
4. **Delete all channels.**

DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS BOT. DO NOT CLICK LINKS FROM ANYONE YOU DON'T KNOW.

**What does the bot want?**

Chaos.

**If you have any information on this bot, or would simply like to share a screenshot of the dm send me it via discord.**

\- **TheGlowingTorch#1889**

**Or a group link:** **rwJUb5**

Events:

\-11:50 pm 28th March I get dmed.

\-2:51 am (GMT-4), the bot changed it's name to ""Fake Twitch Bot.""

\- 1:30 pm 29th March, The entire discord server is gone and a new one is created.

\- 2pm 29th March There are now dedicated staff team to the ""FREE NITRO GIVEAWAY"" discord server.

\-  3PM 29th March MODS DELETE THE POST!

The bot askes you to add itself to your server giving you free access to discord's Nitro Gaming Service.

Now humans are humans and most people on Discord would think this message is legit. My own friends have fallen for this. A server with 30,000 people is now gone. That's not all the damage I know of.

**Dm ALL USERS OF THAT DISCORD SERVER THEN BAN EVERYONE.** 

DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS BOT. DO NOT CLICK LINKS FROM ANYONE YOU DON'T KNOW.

Chaos.

fr1tk0,preyneyv,Feature Request: Convert Jump Links Into Message Embeds,"Dear Discord,

I am glad to see that you have added jump links to Discord (although this was a while ago). However, they are straight up ugly to look at. It's just this long, visually meaningless URL that me, a poor human, cannot even imagine to fathom.

No. Not okay. I suggest that, when a jump link is recognized by Discord, it gets replaced with an embed of that message. This would allow for us to know what each other is referring to, without needing to click on the link to jump back.

In fact, the new quote feature that's been added? This would work perfectly with that! Instead of just making it a Markdown quote with a ping @ that person, it could be a rich embed that makes more sense and makes the chatting experience that much better.

In fact, I believe this is the only feature that I miss from WhatsApp. And you don't want to be worse than WhatsApp.

 @  everyone Hi everyone- i get that you may be annoyed from the ping. **This is very important.** There's a scam going around on discord of a ""Twitch"" bot. **100% bullshit** It will claim to be invited to your server and give you nitro and twitch prime. This is outlined as ""not allowed"" in the discord TOS. (for bots) That's why we want you to help us. And to inform you of this scam. It will also ask for you to be invited to your server, and is already giving free nitro. This, of course, is all a lie. This isnt official. It doesnt have the verified badge.  **How can you help?** Report it. That's all we can do for now. Report the user, report the server, report everything. Let's hope we can get rid of this quickly so Discord can take quick care of it. **Here's how to report:** [https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000291932) **User id for the bot (to report)** 615791646021517362 **Server id (also report)** 693578890748362843  If you're in the server, get out of there.

fqzlko,HAHArun2y0mama,Does anyone else have audio glitches when they call their friends?,"So it's been happening for a couple months now, and it happens with multiple people I've talked to.

Basically, I'll start a call with a friend, and I'll have them at the default 100% volume, but when they join, it is ridiculously loud, so I'll have to lower it to about 10% volume to get them to sound the normal volume, and it will be good for the remainder of the call. Now if I talk to the same person again in a seperate call later on, they'll be very quiet, how they would normally sound at 10%, so I'll raise it back up to 100%, and it will be okay. But then comes the next call, still at 100% volume, but they will be insanely loud again, to the point where when they first speak, I have thrown my headset off of my head because it hurt my ears so bad. So now whenever I get on a call with someone, I have to keep the headset off of my ears until I hear them talk so I know whether they sound normal or not.

But what's worse is when it is a group call. If I'm in a server voice channel with one friend and have their volume sorted out already, if another friend joins, there's a good chance that the volume is messed up for them, and I just get ear raped by them soley. It wouldn't bother me so much if it wasn't so insanely loud to the point where it's actually hurting my ears for a few minutes at a time.

When I rejoin it works fine for a few minutes maybe, but then it keeps happening over and over again.

fqsulh,XAncientxSoulX,Share video camera links gone!? New Golive feature competing with zoom? Is it about the money??,"After observing over the past 24 hours, me and my administration have collected that its perhaps true that discord has disabled the feature of the ( use of video camera in Server's) in order to save money on bandwitch, in order to implement school/college effective ways to teach students online, however... isn't discord built for gamers? Built for large communities to interact? Building friendships from all around the world? Not to suck up to the aristocracy of college implementation over its students? Well discord we have lots of questions, and we only wish for you to answer to us to give us clarity, since you have been ignoring me, and my administration through support tickets. So it's time to go public with questions and answers. 

Proof of ignoring topic /deletion of post related: 
https://discordapp.com/channels/509850754388066304/545050085210193930/693505058427502593

1) Why have you made it where servers are unable to access video camera/screen sharing in the server? 

How we feel as your number #1 community:

We have used this hidden feature for about 1 year, me and my group of friends, it was the best feature me and my fellow gamers, friends, and almost anyone we found on the internet a place to call home the best thing ever. however ever since its been patched most of my users of 150+, and so has many other communities, not just mine, but over 5k+ from all around the world in various countries.. which by the way are more than likely your majority of nitro boosters, and subscribers/supporters of your app... which fund you guys. So can you answer this? Taking this away, especially during the mist of covid-19, when literally when everyone home, is not a good way to help. 

2) is it Go live vs Zoom? 

What I noticed:

Zoom has been gaining an insanely amount of popularity as of recently due to the cornovirus, and their stocks have doubled. However, their approach is directly to company's, but now they have transformed into college/high school based communications. And trust me, we do not want to move on to zoom, we love discord all too much. But, if this is your way of competition, especially during this pandemic, your completely ignoring your users that built discord, and what made it what it is today, and that's extremely petty especially since it was meant for building communities, not sucking up to school aristocracy. Or maybe your simply trying to lower bandwidth usage to save money, even tho we support you guys 🤭

3) Is there a better feature coming out, just unannounced? 

What i noticed: 

hopefully, that its true that you are building something so much better, than the camera features, we had to use for links is going to be much easier to access even for phone users which would be amazing 👏 😀.  Which would kinda make sense for the low-profile security patches, that took effect almost 24 hours ago from the time of this post. However, you guys have done 1-2, and ignored our questions because we are genuinely concerned as a community. So please, respond to everyone, else it really would hurt your company. Because we are as invested into discord, as we wish you guys hope to be. 


*Note - I won't claim as any of this as facts, its just built up opinions over the course of time, from people from all around the world who use this function. However discord, you owe your #1 Community an explanation to all of these questions since you have been ignoring us.",14,1585430477,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fqsulh/share_video_camera_links_gone_new_golive_feature/,discordapp,2

* Uninstalling audio drivers and reinstalling them

fqnqtj,GooseNoir,Discord voice chat wrecks my audio,"I posted this to r/windows10 as well, to no avail. I also opened a support ticket to discord, so we'll see where that goes. 

Immediately  upon entering any voice chat software, all audio on my PC ""breaks."" My  microphone stops detecting any sound, and my speakers stop making any  sound. The only way to get audio back is restarting my computer.

After  restarting, I can check my microphone in the sound control panel, and  it shows that its detecting sound again. It even plays back my voice.  But once I enter any voice chat software, (Discord, Discord on browser,  Skype, Teamspeak, built in Blizzard chat) all hell breaks loose and  everything stops working again until next restart.

I'm running my microphone through a presonus audiobox 96.

As  far as troubleshooting, I have reinstalled my voice chat software,  reinstalled audio drivers, tried every USB port, tried both XLR ports,  checked all audio knobs, and allowed programs to take exclusive control  of my microphone. I plugged my interface into another computer, tried Discord, and it worked perfect.

I can't imagine what I'm missing. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Or even a nudge in the right direction. Or another place I can try for tech support.",0,1585414233,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fqnqtj/discord_voice_chat_wrecks_my_audio/,discordapp,1

We bumblefucked around for a bit and eventually found Zoom, which we've been paying for and using since. We still use our discord server for communication and casual voice chat which makes Zoom a bit of a pain to fire up when we need video for a session.

Because of the big covid-19 thing a lot of stuff has come out about Zoom privacy issues, so we're thinking about video call alternatives again.

fqm69d,Kemeros,FIX - Process flag to keep the CPU priority of Discord.exe at normal instead of low when you minimize Discord,"Hello,

This is for folks with older computers like mine. A fix to a specific issue that probably doesn't affect many.

Discord starting behaving differently on my PC but only with very recent games.

My computer is a venerable 5 years old and my CPU has only 4 cores with no Hyper Threading. It still works well but some games like The Division 2 eat up almost all my CPU. 

Issue: When i play The Division 2 with my friends, they complain that i sound choppy or can't hear me at all.

I start investigating. My CPU is at 90% when I'm in the game and hit 100% once in a while. At first i thought maybe Discord didn't get enough CPU time and that was the result. Maybe it's the end for this old pal?  


Nope.  


When i looked deeper, i found something strange. You have many Discord.exe open when you use Discord. But only one of them actually uses the CPU. I thought, maybe i can raise it's CPU priority? But what do i find? That precise Discord.exe(not the other ones) is set to low priority. At first i thought i might have done a stupid and touched something i shouldn't have. I started reading on the web for similar cases. Everyone is saying the same thing: It only happens if you minimize Discord(to taskbar or tray). Strange... Why would Discord do that? To save performance?  


I looked through the web some more and learned that Discord is made with an framework called Electron and that Electron applications have this behavior. Then i came across this Github Issue:

[https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2822](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2822)

&amp;#x200B;

There is a flag to disable this behavior!

For me, it was the go-to option as you can't view other streams while you are streaming via the Go Live feature. If you and some friends wanted to share each other's screens, you'd have to initiate a video call, possibly interrupting those who are busy. While the UI for Go Live is refined and allows for volume control and has higher performance, the multi-share ability alone made it superior to the Go Live feature. Especially for collaborative projects. 

Now that this ability is missing, it has become infinitely more irritating for those sharing and viewing screen-shares. All you have to do is get rid of the fucking limitation of multi-share. Please and thank you.

fqb0y4,plaidroni,[SUPPORT] Discord being extremely slow,"I would have made a ticket directly to the discord support team, but I feel like the community should be able to assist me, as someone may have had the issue before.

&amp;#x200B;

In the last few months, my discord has been extremely buggy, and laggy. for example, when I unmute, or mute myself, it takes atleast a second to play the audio cue that it has been muted. Sometimes when I unmute, my sound doesn't work at all, and I have to rejoin the call. It often cuts out my mic, and I have to rejoin the call multiple times to have it turn back on.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just some issues I've been having, among many others, and it feels as if discord is just being extremely slow.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe my specs are an issue, I'm running on a monster of a PC, and a microphone that is always on, but it seems that one of the updates may have bogged the application. I have tried clearing cache, and re-installing the app.

Most people here have weak internet connections, myself included, and also weak PCs (myself included, kinda). Our teacher has an i7-8700k, so he can stream without too much problem, but I've found out that his voice will lag while streaming, and everything will be pretty much choppy and slow.

Is there anyway to improve this and be able to use Discord for these classes, and so those who have slow internet connections and/or computers can watch the stream without buffering or having a huge impact in their computer's/internet performance?

Hello,

Thank  you for reaching out. We’re sorry to hear that you are having this  experience and we understand that this can be extremely concerning.

Have  you reached out to the server owner about this?  Your server admin  should be stepping in and moderating accordingly. You should talk to the  admins and let them know about what's going on. If the admins aren't  responsive to such messaging or they condone the reported behavior, we  can follow up to evaluate further action.

Sincerely,   
 Discord Trust &amp; Safety ""  


 I replied to this message, sending all the evidence about this server (the founder who authorizes and posts images of sexualized loli. Who insults those who prohibit this kind of thing). And since then, no more answers!   


 My plan was to try to punish this kind of members and this kind of server as much as possible. But me and my friends can't even delete a single one, because we only have bot messages in front!  All these servers openly trivialize pedophilia, even authorize it! And NO ONE punishes them!

During the problem i can hear other sounds of my PC as normal ( Game Music etc).
During the problem i tested the input device (Arctis 7 chat) in windows settings and i can hear the TEST button as normal.

Things i ve done and did NOT work:
I played around with the devices in discord settings (Default, Arctis 7 certified etc).
I reinstalled discord.
Reinstalled drivers and software of the headset.
Disconnect/Reconnect voice chat or changing voice channels in discord does nothing.

Board games are a bit ticker, but they're a few games like King of Tokyo where there's no hidden cards, everything is open on the board for everyone to see, so all I need to do is point my webcam at the board and everyone on the channel can see it.

However dice rolls could be a problem, I know there's apps we could use but this game has bespoke dice.

So I was thinking a second camera set up pointing at the dice (I have a couple of webcams plus a DSLR that can be tethered along with some action cameras and phone cameras) and would like to show this as picture in picture, maybe like the bottom corner, anyone know of a package that would do this I could then stream through discord?",0,1585313717,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fpwg5i/multiple_camera_streaming_for_boardgame_nights/,discordapp,1

fppfes,xTynini,What rate limits should you use for bot automation?,"I completely understand the reason for no hardcapped limits for bots such as changing role colours, so bots can respond to users and complete actions flawlessly.

Quick automation and abuse of the API is against ToS, which makes sense.

However, bots like Pokecord will indefinitely, forever, automatically, send messages in a channel you set, and it hasn't been banned yet.

What's an acceptable rate limit for performing actions automatically like sending a message? 10 seconds? a minute? 20 minutes? an hour? I was in a server that automatically changed the role of a colour every 10 seconds and that didn't seem too bad

Although they don't have set hardcaps it would be nice if they could at-least give guidelines to what's acceptable as they're clearly turning blind eyes to bots like Pokecord",2,1585278029,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fppfes/what_rate_limits_should_you_use_for_bot_automation/,discordapp,1

On discord I have echo cancellation, noise reduction, and automatic gain control enabled.

I use a standard USB mic, just plug in and go. I use no settings in OBS or other software because ive never been able to find out good settings for myself.

ive watched youtube videos on getting better mic quality but they are always “you have to figure out your own settings because it’s different for everyone”. which i get. 
but discord must be doing it automatically with some kind of default settings that work for most people without any headache? ahh.

I was coming here to ask for any ideas or opinions on what exactly discord does to make audio better. Anything I can do to match their settings exactly somehow? They work so much better than any advice I’ve gotten when I’ve tried figuring out OBS audio settings/filters and voicemeeter banana.

Sometimes apparently even the mic cuts out but then at the same time not the camera. If i leave exit the app or restart the app the camera instantly breaks. However once we start a new call it all goes back to normal until eventually breaking again. I found nothing online about this and its been bothering me so much and my friends.

fph2yv,DrkNinja,The Death of Community Servers?,"So hear me out...

4-5 years ago I had a teamspeak server, and it was the center of my friends and I's online worlds. We would sit in the teamspeak for HOURS playing different games, just talking, or even just sitting there alone waiting for another community member to get on. I started using discord 2-3 years ago, and have had a server set up roughly the same way I had my teamspeak server set up. In that 2-3 years no one does those things that we used to do in teamspeak. No one connects unless you ask them to, and a majority of people prefer calls over the server.

Am I wrong? Does anyone still have that server experience or has something about discord made it so that behavior isn't promoted anymore? Is it the cost? TS servers require you to either pay for them or require a lot of set up to host it; could that be why?

fpb66f,sasukerook,Need help with composing a structured and informative welcome page on my server?,"Hi, I have a question about Discord. So I own a server and want to make a friendly and educative infopiece on what Discord is:

&gt;Discord is a free chat program that allows for instant messaging, group messaging, and voice chat. A Discord ""server"" is just a group that someone has set up on Discord. It might have sub-channels for different topics of discussion, and it might have different voice channels.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you've been around the internet for a while, you can think of Discord as more user-oriented IRC with added features like voice chat and lots of media stuff. It originated as a communication platform for gaming, but has gone mainstream by now.

Do you guys think it's comprehensive? I think there's more to elaborate. Such as how do we know when a channel is active or not, etc. But I don't know how to phrase it.",2,1585227984,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fpb66f/need_help_with_composing_a_structured_and/,discordapp,1

I recall hearing something about discord increasing the maximum amount of people for voice channels, but:

&amp;#x200B;

Can the teacher use the videochat feature to stream the class to us?

It'd be something like GoLive(one person shares screen, the rest can see but don't participate) but with the actual camera feed from the mobile/laptop/cam.

I recall that the maximum people for videochat was 9, so, can this be done at all? we are 30 people in the class and the teacher uses a whiteboard, so the GoLive feature itself its not useful here.

fpao64,somearsehole,Need a better way to talk to people and still hear my games,"Not a pc gamer. Although I usually have discord open on my laptop or my phone so I can talk with friends who almost exclusively use discord to talk. I've thought about buying a nice headset with a clean built in mic for playstation but alas, no one uses playstation's voice chat because about half of them use their speakerphone to communicate through garbled tones. But I'm trying to be the bigger man and not have complete shit audio. The way the average person communicates nowadays has become so decentralized and janky that I can barely understand what half of them are saying but that's a discussion for another day. I fucking wish people had higher standards for audio and cared that they were actually intelligible half the time. It sucks when your best friend is fucking painfully muffled 90% of the time and doesn't use (or broke?) the someone decent bluetooth mic I bought him over a year ago. But I digress, since this is more about me.

I just want clean audio coming in and out on discord (even if it's just me) while still being able to hear my game audio coming from my console, a separate audio source. As far as I know there isn't a way to get audio from my playstation into headphones while also using discord on a phone or laptop. So the obvious solution is a bluetooth headset or on ear headphones.

I bought the worlds crappiest on ear bluetooth headset that only works on my phone and has horrible input AND output. I use it for discord while gaming on my tv and everyone can hear my game no matter what volume it's at. I think I'm ready to buy a decent bluetooth earpiece or on ear headphone for discord, one that works on my laptop or phone. Or if there's another solution for my situation I'm not thinking of I would love to hear your ideas.

fp8365,NICOALUMINUM,"The Tale of Highguy34, the Greatest Retard of Discord","*It was a calm night in February, when the epic saga of the greatest retard there ever was took place — Highguy34 etched his name into history. *

**The following are actual excerpts, quotes and conversations.**

***CHAPTER I***
 
**“Are that Jeffrey Epstein?”** -Highguy34 in response to Rowon, who has a Jeffrey Epstein profile picture 

“Why is “Are that Jeffrey Epstein?” making me laugh so hard?” -Slyfulness
 
**“Hey hey hey hey hey hey shut the fuck up your a fucking idiot fuck.”** -Highguy34

*Moments after Highguy34’s random outburst, a small group of people would begin trolling Highguy by copy pasting what he wrote, as well as making Epstein jokes. Little did they know Highguy34’s wrath knows no bounds, and the worst was only to come.*

**“You fucking idiots. You joke about Jeffrey Epstein. You fucking idiots.”** -Highguy34

“highguy im gonna find you and rape you” -Rowon 

**“What the fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck? What. The. Fuck.”** -Highguy34

*Moments after, it was apparent just how truly retarded Highguy34 was — and how entertaining trolling him would be. As such, dozens more people began trolling him.*

***CHAPTER II*** 

“hey highguy i fucked ur mom” -DashTheMannis

**“You watch animer shows, you dint fuck anyone.”** -Highguy34

“what? shut up virgin” -DashTheMannis

**“I just saw a cat run across the street. At night. Black Cat at bad night = bad luck (talking to a stupid fucjing animer)”** -Highguy34

“shut your fucking mouth kid mic up” -DashTheMannis

**“Hold the phone (the landline). I will be damned if a stpid little animer tells me what to do.”** -Highguy34

“Hey highguy, you said earlier you want to be king right? I am LC of KG. Duel me and win, I’ll give you the crown.” -BoomerBuckett

**“I have a feeling you are not being that seriously because of youre stupid profile picture.”**
-Highguy34

“Sounds like you aren’t getting king.” -BoomerBuckett

**“Youre profile picture is like when the chinaman takes a shit stupid.”** -Highguy34

“oooo ur getting mad highguy calm down and we can talk later” -BoomerBuckett

**“Fuck you stupid bitch I dint need a permissin slip from a stupid little white dog looking like a fucj in cat and a retarded ass animer fagot named Eric.”** -Highguy34

“alright so take your pick boys. is highguy either:
A foreigner.
Mentally challenged. 
Really young.
All of the above. 

take your picks.” -Venn_i

**“Oh HA HA HA HA. You are so funny Venny. Not. I am born in Misery, USA, I am not a foreienger and I am mentally unchallenged. I am also 21.”** -Highguy34

“LOL THE GREAT STATE OF MISERY USA” -DivineEmpyreus

**“You are strange person.”** -Highguy34 to DivineEmpyreus

“Do you mean Missouri?” -NikolaiMaesterwyne

“He can’t even spell Missouri correctly.” -QuintonB123321

**“ARE YOU FUCKING REATARDE? MISERY, NEW MEXICO, USA. NOT MISSOURI YOY FUCK”** -Highguy34

“Yeah, I'm headed to bed. Lemme know how the rest of this embarrassing sideshow goes.” - QuintonB123321

**“Quinton You piece of shit. You embarased to be associated with me or something BECIASE THESE LITTLE JOKESTERS WANNA PLAY GAMES LIKE A FUCKING CHICKEN WITH A t”** -Highguy34 to QuintonB123321

“BRUH I JUST DRANK WATER AND ALMOST CHOKED” - DivineEmpyreus

**“Good. Die.”** - Highguy34

*At this point, the true scope of Highguy34’s absolute stupidity was only begun to be realized. He would then turn to his old friend turned bitter rival, QuintonB123321, starting the greatest Retard War of all time.*

***CHAPTER III***

“who tf is highguy” -Camiv

“highguy is basically this total spastic who goes on these hilarious rants that are gold and we’ve been trolling him the past hour lmao” -Venn_i

*And suddenly, out of nowhere, the storm rages once more.*

**“OH FUCKING GOLD I AM SO AMUSING BECAUSE MY FRUTRATIPN AND ANGER IS INTRIGUING TO YOU. AS IN A GOLDMNINE OF PAYDIRT. And QUINTON YOUR HOUSE IS SHIT I KNOW FOR A FACT ITS SHIT DONT MAKE ME EXPOSE YOU AND KICK SHIT OUT OF YOU”** -Highguy34

“Highguy vs Quinton so intense” -Decamper

“The Mentally Challenged Roleplayer VS The Balding 23 Year Old Lord. Who shall win?” -Venn_i

**“Okay. Heh he he heh. Give me an hour. Let me make a word document ALL ABOUT THE QUINTON HIGHTOWER.”** -Highguy34

*Some time had passed — time that had felt like days, and Highguy had gone as silent as the crypt. People began to doubt Highguys retard wrath.*

“highguy where are the points man?” -Venn_i

“yeah take his ass out” -DivineEmpyreus

“i wanna see sparks” -Venn_i

“Nah Venni, at the rate he's going he won't even make embers.” -QuintonB123321

**“Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I will start working on it now.”** -Highguy34

“There’s no way you’re fully ‘there’, Highguy.” -Venn_i

**“I am fully here. How else would I be here?”** -Highguy34

“Are you mentally unchallenged?” -DivineEmpyreus

**“What the fuck is mentally unchallenged that isn’t a thing idiot fuck.”** -Highguy34

*More time had passed, and the doubt had grown tenfold. The incumbent Retard-King, Quinton Hightower, had strengthened, and many spectators now doubted Highguy34 as no match for Quintons mental retardation.*

“Well Venni, I'm currently sitting on top of a 500 story lighthouse watching some retard make an ass of himself without me even doing anything” -The Quinton Hightower

“Wait wtf? Why are you in a lighthouse LOL?” -Camiv

“500 story lighthouse WTF LOL” -DivineEmpyreus

“Because it's House Hightower, bitch; I need a good view.” -QuintonB123321

*Even more time had passed. The crowd began to grow weary — they started cheering for Highguy34’s triumphant return — the Discord server needed a hero.*

“Cmon highguy where you at?” -DivineEmpyreus

*And abruptly, as mysteriously as he left the Server, he returned*

**“You stupid bitch. Heh he he heh. I am going to reck you and that fat bish Raena93.”** -Highguy34 to Quinton, bringing his Girlfriend into it

“OOOOH SHIT” -DivineEmpyreus

“OOOOOOOO” -Camiv

“YOOOO he brought yo girl into it” -Venn_i

**“He barely his girl if you know what I am saying (wink)”** -Highguy34

“OOOH HE ADDING ON” -DivineEmpyreus

“Adorable. Now tell me, where's your bitch Highguy? Probably chained in the back yard like a good dog. Because let's be real; the closest you'll ever get to love is from a dog. -QuintonB123321

“The only camporison you can make to Raena is a dog?” -Highguy34

“OOOOOO” - DivineEmpyreus

“Bro, Quinton, you can’t come back from that” -NikolaiMaesterwyne

“quinton you might have won that 3-0, but tonight it looks like an L.” -Venni

*The first great Battle between the Highguy and Quinton had occurred, and Highguy had triumphantly vanquished the Quinton. But the war was far from over.*

***CHAPTER IV***

“Well, I gotta be up early. But this might be fun. Might just say fuck it and pull an all nighter just to watch this dude” -QuintonB123321

“I would” -DivineEmpyreus 

“You can’t leave now, not after that L bro” -NikolaiMaesterwyne

“I got plenty of coffee. I'll be fine for work crew tomorrow” -QuintonB123321

“oh shit here we go it’s highguy time” -Venn_i

“hes typing lmaooo” -DivineEmpyreus 

**“Nobody gives a fuck about you or your stupid shittower you fucking pussey.”** -Highguy34

“Right. And what have you ever done online or off? Because you have about as much creativity as a 5 year old” -QuintonB123321

**”Hey hey hey hey Quinton suck my balls.

*Highguy34 had unleashed a debilitating attack against Quinton and his girlfriend, Raena93 — but his conspiracy theory was yet to come.*

***CHAPTER V***

**“NO you REATARD QUinton IS RAENA SHE DOES NOT EXIST”** -Highguy34

“LOL” - Venn_i

**“Shut your fucking mouth Quinton.”** -Highguy34

“OOOO” - NikolaiMaesterWyne

“HE PUT DOWN THE HAMMER” - DivineEmpyreus

“And yet you got outsmarted several times by a dude with aspergers. Where does that put you?” -Quinton Hightower

fp7wev,CarryGuun,Buttons or dropdown list on text chat,"Hi all,

We have with our group discord channel for ""tabletop"" rpg and currently using Sidekick bot for dice rolls.

I have been however wondering if there is any way to embed buttons on chat window to simply click for example d100 to get a roll instead of typing everytime /r 1d100 ?

if that is not possible, maybe to lock possibility to write own text in the chat, but instead have a dropdown list of available options?

Not sure if any of these are possible, have been searching a lot past two days.

&gt;  
&gt;If you've been around the internet for a while, you can think of Discord as more user-oriented IRC with added features like voice chat and lots of media stuff. It originated as a communication platform for gaming, but has gone mainstream by now.

fp0c9g,LunosOuroboros,Weird issues regarding the text cursor on the web-based client,"Basically, title.

I use Discord's web-based client via Mozilla Firefox *(v74.0 x86)*, and a few days ago I have noticed that the text selection goes crazy if I use keyboard shortcuts to select certain parts of text sometimes. For example, Shift+Down Arrow, Shift+Left Arrow or Shift+Down Arrow+Left Arrow for example. [Here's a quick video showing it as much as I could](https://streamable.com/pbjlo).

There's something I forgot to show, but if I do a left click on the very end of my message, the text cursor goes back to the beginning. For example, if I write on the chat ""Hello!"" and do a left click right after the exclamation mark, the text cursor puts me right before the ""H"".

Will channel 4 automatically have the same role-based permissions as channels 1,2,3? I'd think so because I set the permissions for the entire category, so I'd expect all channels inside the category to inherit the permissions.

My class is filled with hardcore-social people and I can sense that a lot of them have taken a hard hit to their productivity and mental health due to the isolation. So; I want to start a virtual student bar, and I thought this would be best done in Discord. 

The ideas I've had so far are setting up a Discord group with different rooms such as ""Bar"" which would be purely talking, ""Board game table"" where I thought it would be fun to have a board game running online where people could join or spectate and ""Beer-pong table"" where there would be a virtual beer pong table* and people again could either join or spectate.

So here's where I want your help: 
I know it's possible to do all these things online, but fx. with the board game, I don't know how to make it ""spectator-friendly"" as I can only find online board games where you see it solely from a player's view so people would be able to cheat if a player streamed their screen. Is there a truly virtual board game, where you could stream the board only and then players could join the board? Or does anyone have another idea? Beer Pong you could perhaps do by having those that want to play setup the cups of their opponent and then try and hit that from the correct distance, so when they hit a cup in their own home the opponent would have to drink? Or do you have another idea of how to do this?

I hope some of you might have ideas of how to do this or if you have any other ideas on how to make a great virtual bar, please feel free to write your suggestions! :D",0,1585145770,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/for0d0/help_setting_up_a_virtualstudent_bar/,discordapp,1

I didnt think much of it because if any of you guys played the game you know how loud this gets.

So after starting the game, I played the tutorial and when I shot the enemys and broke their shield, he said he could hear that. Also if bullets fly toward me he also said he is able to hear that. But when I shoot enemys which are not in a distance of 10m he couldnt hear my ingame sound.

I also had this problem with rainbow six siege, but only when starting the game but  Ingame no one could hear my sound through discord.

I tried searching for a resolution online and got really frustrated, because everything I tried didn´t work.

fojzar,SerperiorityComplex,Is this a voice chat or internet issue?,"Hi all,

I would put this in the Discord Testers server but I'm actually unsure if this is a bug or what's going on. 

Basically whenever I voice chat someone, the audio is *extremely* loud. I have to turn my headphones all the way down to 20-30 for it to be tolerable and even then, it's obvious that they sound a lot louder than they should. This has been happening for about a week now both in DM calls and server calls.

Sometimes, when I rejoin the call a few times or restart the app, the issue is resolved and they sound normal again (so I'm aware this isn't an issue with my/their headset in that case). However this happens more often than not, and it is really annoying considering I have to turn other apps up when in voice calls, and it's just a nuisance overall since I'm not understanding why this is happening.

I again don't know if this is a bug or not so apologies if this isn't the right place to post in. Some other things worth mentioning are that I've tested my headphones on other apps, and I know for sure it's not that. It's something only happening on Discord. I've seen 0 reports of this elsewhere so I'm really not sure what's going on with my client, if it's my internet, whatever, I'm really not sure.

So those red spikes appear on the F10 menu of the game. They usually happens in a short moment of time (kinda grouped). It actually becomes worse over time. When it happens too often, I have to restart Discord, but it is still there while freshly restarted, just less.

Gigabyte GTX 1080 8gb GPU

16 gb corsair RAM

When I set the option on speakers R audio, it works. Then, after going in voice chat in a specific discord server and having a teacher that has a buggy go live on his Mac, my mic crackles until i unplug and replug it, then no problem. 
I don't know where it could be coming from but a friend of mine also has audio problems on discord. These seem to only happen with discord, so if anyone has a similar problem, let me know!

* When I go to the Streamkit website for OBS to generate new links, i see the error: "" **CAN'T CONNECT TO THE DISCORD CLIENT** "" (pic related).

After some time of staying in a voice call (and usually while gaming at the same time), Discord becomes very slow and unresponsive, as does the rest of my computer.

fnwk55,OOPS_Studio,We need a setting to disable Reduced Motion.,"I have no idea what the developers were thinking when they added this, but I feel that it needs to be fixed because it effects me a lot and it's making Discord at least 10% worse than it was before simply because there's no ""off"" switch, but rather ONLY ""on"" and ""inherit"" switches, which is just stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6nb704zlyio41.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e079ec0c585a758c6eccc117d6ffb33865aa9c1f

So I'm on Windows 10. I have the reduced motions setting inside my Windows Settings switched so that I would get lass animations. Mostly because it saves RAM and increases performance, but also because the animation get a little bit annoying to ""wait for"" when you use your PC the way I do that requires lots of repetitive clicks and selections and things. Anyway, I use Discord a ton, like very very often, and as of recently (I think it was 1-2 days ago) all the GIFs in the app stopped playing by themselves and made me have to hover over them to watch them, which was a bit weird to me, because I assume nobody prefers that. So I open up my Discord settings and go to the Text &amp; Images tab and find this setting:

I notice that it won't let me turn it on because I have some setting called ""Reduced Motion"" activated. I go to the Appearance tab and find this setting:

AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF!! Like who designed that?? Why would they make a bunch of settings inherit their values from a setting that can't even be turned off?? My options are ""inherit on from Windows"" or ""turn it on"" but I don't get to turn it off, apparently...

fnshjl,Throwawaygaygayyygay,How are chat and image log bots not against TOS/GPDR?,"It's common knowledge that there are bots that can be added to servers that can log messages and images when they are deleted. These bots are pretty much present in every established discord. How does this not go against GPDR's right to deletion act, Discord Terms Of Service, and copyright laws in terms of images? For instance, what if someone posted pictures of themselves or of another person, sure, the offending images can be deleted before someone screenshots it, but the bot in the server can store it in a channel that the admin(s) can see.  Same applies if someone posts revealing information about themselves and then retroactively delete it  
You can argue this logging is important for reports and security reasons for a channel. But let's be real, not all admins are mature and abiding. Some admins are malicious and could use this information from the deleted text and images log bots to doxx someone or expose that information to the public.  
This type of information shouldn't readily available to any and anyone who creates a sever and adds these bots to them. That right should be reserved to the creators and support team of Discord. All in all, why does Discord not understand these types of bots can be dangerous for the general public to have access too. They should be removed in my personal opinion.   
Also, I know someone is going to bring the ability to screenshot things but that's not the same thing, plus in some cases, you can get screenshots removed from platforms if you report them.",4,1584999275,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fnshjl/how_are_chat_and_image_log_bots_not_against/,discordapp,1

fnrn41,TheAbyssGazesAlso,Using Discord for Tabletop roleplaying,"HI all,

In this new age of nobody leaving their homes, I've been looking at using Discord to facilitate tabletop roleplaying. I could use something like Roll20, but I like Discord, and it has a die roller bot that works well for the RPG I want to use (roll 20 is only geared for D&amp;D, really).

I did some playing, trying to get the app to work well on three different machines, but I ran into some stumbling blocks.

1) Can I initiate a video chat with members of a discord server? I could only work out how to do it with discord ""friends"", but when I did that, it means that it was not using the server I had set up, so the die rolling bot didn't work.

2) When sharing a screen, the video drops out from the PC that is sharing. Is there anyway to be sending my screen (or an app window) and ALSO my video feed?

3) When viewing my shared screen on the other PCs, their view of each others' video feed became minuscule, is that configurable? I would like it a bit larger so we can actually see each other's faces.

Maybe this just isn't the right app, but I feel like it's so close, and should be able to do the few small things I mentioned above. Can anyone point me in the right direction(s)?",0,1584996519,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fnrn41/using_discord_for_tabletop_roleplaying/,discordapp,1

I have a presentation due tomorrow on discord (because of the quarantine), my presentation requires me to play several videos and so I need sound.
I can stream the presentation just fine but I don't have sound, I'm aware there's a fix that involves adding the application you're streaming in the game overlay thing, it works but since my presentation calls on multiple programs I have to switch manually what I'm streaming every time I'm calling on a new app and it's just not an option since it's highly unpractical and the presentation is fairly lenghty.
So my question is, is there any way to have sound when streaming the entire screen and not with the ""app by app"" system ?.

1: It collects and stores data without permission, displaying it for everyone to see, which can hurt certain users.

2: Has premium features that double down on the non-consensual data mining and is pretty much the equivalent of spying on your server's users.

fnl663,MustachedSquid,Ramdom emoji just became usable,"Hello.
So I have found a very weird bug with discord desktop app on windows 10.
I am on many servers, these many servers have their own custom emojis.
I am NOT a nitro user, I do NOT have nitro, so I shouldnt be able to use custom emojis outside of the server that owns them.
Well, today I was talking in a dm group with friends, and was gonna type an emoji, a suggestion came up, that suggestion was for one of the servers emojis, wich I shouldnt have access to outside of that server, I typed it down, it worked, on a DM group, I dont know how this appened.
so, I tought maybe the DM glitched?, I dmed a friend the emoji, it worked!
So now I went in some ramdom server im on, and sent the emoji, it also worked!
so I opened the emoji menu to check that, it appears every one of the emojis from that server is locked, exept the one I was able to use outside of it, why is that?
Is this a known bug?
what caused it?

Image of the emoji list, everything is greyed out expet that emoji

I found a discord support page but do not understand it. https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206141927-How-is-the-permission-hierarchy-structured-

The following images and text should explain the current configuration.

* Group/Channel Role Permissions: https://i.imgur.com/QQOw56Q.png

I left all of the server role options set to ""not on"" for the most part. The member role does have two items turned on as shown.

The group of text channels have the configuration setup and role order as shown in that image. All items without an off or on setting are left neutral/passive.

The quarantine role is not overriding the member permissions for the text channels that are part of the ""general"" category.

The goal is to have the quarantine role make it so that the send messages, embed links, attache files, and speak abilities are neutralized that the member role below it allows the user to do.

These days, especially with Corona, I have been using Discord for a bunch of gaming and *NON-gaming* related activity, including some quasi-professional use, local community groups, etc.

I don't want my professional contacts seeing whether I am playing Civ 6 or whatever else at night. I've tried to address this by:

1. Logging off whenever I'm going to game...
2. Leaving a few specific servers whenever I want to play a game
3. Hiding my online status entirely when I want to play a game
4. Having two separate accounts on two completely separate devices going at once, each connected to a different group servers.

People have told me to try and get all these groups to switch over to Slack, because all this finagling is really not fun.

For context, both me and my friend got our accounts disabled a few days ago because of [this. ](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188273/discord-transparency-report-moderation-q2-q3-q4-2019-spam-exploitative-content) Discord has been banning accounts at random and both of our accounts were wrongly disabled because of this. I ain't a oblivious jackass that would violate the community guidelines so I tried to send tickets to prove my innocence to the Support Team, however I only got an automatic response from a fucking bot, it responded to the 4 tickets I sent with the same bullshit. I even tried to adress this on the official Discord Twitter page and still no response. 


My friend was the owner of a Discord server and I was the only moderator there. We were the only managing the server and it shouldn't be a problem, since it was a not-so-active and small server. After our accounts got banned, and we couldn't get them back, I decided that the least I could do is get a new account and then claim the ownership and be back in charge. 


Problem is.... 
• The server has 50 members, 40 if you don't count the bots. 
• My friend's account was deleted days ago and his latest messages were in March 7th. 
• Since my old account was banned and I was the only mod, I don't have the manager/administrator permissions.

fnbfaz,4428gamer,RPG Group Moving to Discord: Any advice,"&gt;TL;DR at bottom  
&gt;  
&gt;Due to the virus swimming around outside of our windows, my group is trying to find an alternative since about half of us can't meet up (which includes myself).  
&gt;  
&gt;We have three games on three different days and since I'm the tech savvy one of the group, as in I'm the only tech savvy one, I am trying to set up Discord to best suit all gaming needs. Roll20 will only work for one game so I want some advice from the Discord-skilled people.

1. Does anyone know of a way to have some sort of overlay for pictures only? This would mostly be for maps that the RPG games would normally use. I'm looking for an alternative to pinned messages because if we use pins for every map and important picture for all three games, the pin messages will fill up so quickly.

2. I think I can set up a music bot on my own but does anyone have a link for setting one up just in case? I know that music bots are incredibly optional but I want to try and make the idea of using Discord more appealing to the group. Might as well make the best of a bad situation, right?

3. Like I said, I consider myself good with computers but some of my group is not, with some entirely new to Discord. Is there anything I should help them figure out aside from the basics to get everyone on a good enough page to use the app?

4. Finally, is there anything else (an extra bot, an overlooked feature, or simply a good word of advice) that someone who uses Discord for RP games, Deadlands &amp; Pathfinder specifically, should know? Anything would be greatly appreciated!

fn7svg,HoneyVadger69,[Help],"I started noticing a couple of weeks ago that while playing a game, if I join a discord server, a delayed audio cue will happen, and then it would cut all audio on my PC, including discord's. The only way to regain the audio is to restart both discord and the game. While this is mildly infuriating, it was somewhat manageable. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling discord and the game (apex legends) to no avail. As of recent, it seems when I join a server, it will play a delayed chime, all audio will stay for a bit, and then cut out. Forcing me to restart my game and discord. It gets even weirder because I can still hear the leaving chime when I leave a server after all of my audio cuts out. I've tried to turn the Attuenation setting down, I've updated all of my drivers, I've done everything I could think to do to solve this issue with no avail.

Discord defaults to the $10 Nitro if you were subscribed before February.  The main differences between the $10 Nitro and $5 Nitro is that the $10 Nitro gives you 2 server boosts and a 100MB file upload size ($5 Nitro gives you 30% off server boosts and 50MB file upload size).

I luckily changed my subscription in time before it renovated this month, but my friends got charged $10, against their wishes.

Now that i started to play Warzone, i get cut off every 10 seconds or so. While waiting in the Lobby, everything is fine but as soon as the game starts my voice gets cut off and so does theirs.

fn4zsw,cwillzz,Mic sounds awful on discord only,"Hi, I'm sure this has been posted multiple times before so I'm sorry to bother if the information is already out, however I was not able to find a solution based on what I have already looked at regarding this topic. I have a pretty nice recording setup: multiple good mics and a focusrite 18i8 interface. I do a lot of music recording/producing so I'm pretty familiar with the world of digital audio. 

Recently, while using discord, my friends have been noting that my mic sounds terrible, and when I use the playback function on discord I definitely agree with them. The sound is distorted/muffled. When I check on a different recording program, my mic sounds amazing, as it should. I have tried multiple different mics to no avail, so I know the problem lies within discord.

The only real improvement I have heard is by changing to the legacy subsystem. Otherwise, messing with the audio setting has not improved much. I host the voice channel and have incredible internet (hardwired, latency of about 18s, gigabite download speed). I additionally have every other input and output for audio disabled other than my interface.\\

I joined this sever again recently like a couple of days ago  to help me find answers to the situation but based on the bot messages I know before that the last time I joined was August 30th. Due to a personal problem I am in desperate need to figure out when I have left the sever like the dates. I can find out the dates that I joined but I need to figure out the dates of when I left. I’m wondering is there anyway I can get this information. Is there a log of some sort or a data that has this information and how do I get it? i did contact a moderator from the sever and he told me he could only get me the information on when I joined. I have emailed Discord Support and I’m trying to explain the situation but so far I haven’t gotten a clear answer. I have also requested all of my data information hoping that maybe that will have the information but I’m not for sure.

fn15f2,Aht1,Twitter Feed with filter option,"Hi there, 

so I'm currently using Zapier to post tweets from a certain (game event) account into a Channel on our Discord server. This works well so far. Problem is that the Owner of the Twitter account sometimes tweets manually which is a tad annoying. So i tried to add a filter in Zapier which doesn't seem possible as free user and i think honestly 19.95 per month is a bit too much to ask for such a simple use. I also found IFTTT but i couldn't find an option to filter for specific messages.

Is there any free to use application that can do the following:

  
1) Grab what a specific user tweets,  
2) Filter for a specific word/string/hashtag,  
3) Post only those messages that passed the filter to a specified Discord channel.

fmycbg,Tallio,User hears himself when certain mobile User joins,"Hello everybody,  

got a little puzzle for you because it is not the obvious reason with the obvious solution.   

I have an old Nexus 7 pad that I wanted to give my parents for videochatting during the lockdowns. I installed the discord app on it and everything ran fine while testing videochat at my pc. No echoing, clear sound, no stutters.  

But when my wife joins as a third user the call, she hears herself talking with ca. 1 second delay. This even happens when the output and the microphone on the Nexus 7 is deactivated. When I use my mobile phone with discord to videocall her, this doesn't happen. When she uses discord with other users, this doesn't happen. I'm really puzzled here, maybe someone has a solution.  

TLDR: Nexus 7 user joins a videocall, my wife hears herself double, even with deactivated micro and speakers of the Nexus 7 user.",1,1584875648,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fmycbg/user_hears_himself_when_certain_mobile_user_joins/,discordapp,1

While playing games like brawlhalla, my microphone is working as intended, but at the startup of apex my voice sounds robotic or like I'm speaking through a fan. I have tried disabling hardware acceleration, setting discord to have higher priorities as well as running as admin, and updating drivers. I am really stuck since it doesn't seem like this is a common issue. If anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks everybody.

Automatic sensitivity is off, as well as all advanced voice settings (echo cancellation, noise suppression, and automatic gain). The problem persists with them on as well. I do not have any special settings on in the windows control panel. It seems as if my mic is bypassing Discord's processing somehow.

This is incredibly annoying because I don't have a fancy mic where I can adjust the sensitivity, but that shouldn't even matter because the noise gate built directly into Discord should be working.

fmpre2,EmeraldSlash,Microphone input mixing with desktop audio,"For some reason discord (also OBS and Voicemeeter) has started recording my desktop audio as well as my microphone input when I'm in voice chatting. e.g. If I have music playing in the background it will go through as well as my voice. I tried recording my voice in the Voice Recorder app (I'm using Windows 10) and it didn't capture the desktop audio, so I know it has something to do with specific applications.

Originally I thought this was an issue with my hardware however after using different audio ports, different microphones, etc. the problem didn't go away. I also uninstalled the Realtek HD audio driver and installed the unofficial UAD Realtek HD driver for different reasons but that changed nothing.

I've tried all of the Discord audio settings, sound device properties, Realtek Audio Console, and Voicemeeter, but nothing has worked and I can't find any mention of a similar issue anywhere on the internet either. So, any ideas on how I can fix this?

fmnyg5,CriticalGoku,Need some points on doing Discord Go Live,"I'd like to do watch parties for groups of 5-10 people by streaming movies i'm playing on my PC (this is personal files hosted on my computer, so just broadcasting a streaming service) to everyone. I tried last night but we were having some quality issues where I was hoping for a pretty seamless Netflix-like experience for everyone watching. I just have some general questions for anyone with experience doing go live:

1. What upload speeds do you need to have to really stream effectively on discord? I was streaming from an ethernet connected PC but don't know what my upload speed was last night. Today it measured at 11.93 mbps which seems pretty good for a home connection.
2. When sharing my plex app/video player wasn't working well I tried to just share my screen but people weren't getting sound. Is there a way to make sure audio transmits on screen share?
3. The other thing was people wanting to be able to comfortably watch the stream from their TV instead of a laptop, monitor, or phone.  Since there's no discord app for smart TVs or such, what's the best way to do this?
4. Related, but the stream being connected to the voice server also seems to cause some issues with flexible watching. For example, as the host I would also like to watch the movie i'm streaming on my TV instead of my host computer, which is in a different room. I can accomplish this by broadcasting my screen to my TV over Steam Link and can use a bluetooth keyboard/mouse to control things from there, but what I can't seem to do is talk on Discord since my PC is in another room. Is there any way I can run the stream from one device and use voice on another one?

fmmhyv,Jtschwan,Need help with a more advanced discord role setup,"My discord server needs more of a hierarchical role setup rather than a flat list of roles. For most servers it’s okay just to have an admin and or a moderator role that manages all of the other roles. Sometimes people will add bots to allow users to self assign a role. I need a server that will allow some moderators to have permissions over a select set of roles, and other moderators to have permissions over another set.

For example: I can have an admin role that has server permissions. The admin can create roles “team A captain”, and “team A member”. He can then create “team B captain” and “team B member”. The “captain” roles have full control over only the team that they are assigned to.

According to my understanding, this isn’t possible with raw discord permissions. This would be because roles are in a flat, linear list. One team captain would have to be above another team captain in the hierarchy, and thus couldn’t have specific permissions to only one of the lower roles.

I’m a developer and I was thinking about making a bot that could have admin privileges and it could be set up with a set of rules that allow people with specific roles to assign roles to other members, but only if there is a rule specified by the server admin if it’s okay. It would basically be a role assistant. I’m certain somebody has to have created this already though.

So, is this possible with discord alone? If not, is there a bot that could do this for me? If not, how much do you think the community would appreciate it if I made one?

fmip2g,xysteam,Mac computer Discord output problem,"Hi, so a friend of mine is using different programs to talk to  his friends while gaming, but when using Discord and setting his output to his personal headset which is a Razer Electra V2 UsbMessage, he keeps hearing a loud noise that mostly sounds like a fan running or a helicopter sound, and it's pretty loud and annoying. It ONLY happens on Discord not on anything else like Teamspeak. I tested all his settings in every way and it seems like only Discord displays this sound.

He said the Usb plug is close to where his fans are so that's where I think the problem might be, only thing is even when I mute/deafen myself, he hears it, even if he's deafened/muted he will still hear it.

There are 2 problems here I think, 1 is how is Discord catching ANY sound when the user is deaf/mute which basically should take out any incoming and outcoming sounds. Second how do I troubleshoot it? I mean reinstall didn't work, reset voice settings didn't work?

(And i know for a fact that it is not my internet, because the delay has been going on for over a month).

Discord sometimes when i play a game, completely mutes the game. So i go check the volume mixer but there is nothing wrong there. Then i have to restart the game to fix the sound.

If i do anything on discord there is a 50% chance that the game either gets completely muted, Discrod freezes, or the entire sound system gets completely turned off after a few minutes of the stuff happening (this logo shows)   📷

I cannot do anything in discord while playing any game (happens in league of legends, Escape form Tarkov and Rocket league) Tarkov is most vulnerable to this bug.

I have also tried reinstalling Discrod but that didn't change anything. So i maybe there is something wrong with my account? And i dont belive that it is my headset. Because i have been using it for over a year and i have never had this problem before. It came out of nowhere. Fist occurance after i downloaded Escape form Tarkov, like two months ago.

fme0h2,Psychogynaecologist,PSA for Server Owners &amp; Admins: Help on stopping bot spam.,"Surely some of you have been there: You piss someone off and turns out that person has a fleet of bots to spam your server. Most of the time, you should be able to set up a simple bot to reduce spam and mute or otherwise punish those people, but there's scenarios where the bot joining at all can be a problem, such as in those scenarios where you have bots spam pinging roles or otherwise being general nuisances.

This is not news, and although you can find help for this issue online, even in this very subreddit (I've only done a quick search, so bear with me if some of my information has already been shared, as I believe I have some input which might be of use that isn't exactly rocket science, but also not shared widely) such as https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/c0lxll/regarding_the_recent_influx_of_spam_bots/

Why bring this up at all? I personally believe the fact that verifications being disabled upon receiving a role is a glaring security flaw that needs to be looked over, considering how sometimes you *might* indeed want to run Autorole in your server, or otherwise have joinables that grant someone a role which will remove all forms of verification, allowing for people even without verified emails to post or clog up your server with spam. This has in fact been reported before, even in the feedback channel https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043135631-Verification-Level so I believe it isn't the first time someone's noticed how this can be a problem. I'm not the most knowledgeable person there is, but if I can get an explanation as to why that's the case, and why we don't have access to changing this option so that we can indeed keep verification up, I'd be most obliged.

Regardless of that, there's lots of things we can do to stop self bots, that is, to my understanding, bots that are not verified by the bot tag by Discord itself.

The first thing would be to disable the Server Widget -- from what I can tell, it is a common way of attacking the server by allowing people to create invites to servers for their bots to join in on, regardless of whether normal users have access to creating invites for said server. If you've gotten raided and you check the invites tab and you're not seeing who made the invite? I believe it could very well have been created by the widget. I'd like to get some confirmation on this, as it the thing I have the least knowledge of, but I've certainly had the Widget enabled and have certainly seen invites created from nowhere. I haven't been able to find a feedback channel post for this particular issue, but I'd appreciate if someone else could/has, as well, in case it is indeed a real issue.

Secondly, as mentioned previously and in the posts linked above, granting ANY roles to any user will remove all forms of verification. This makes it so autorole is essentially a no-no, so if you're running that, you want to reconsider it for the time being.

Thirdly, the bots attacking your server most likely cannot pass verification naturally as they probably don't have a verified email attached to them, meaning that ANY form of verification past green/yellow level in the Moderation settings should be something you aim to institute at the very least.

And finally, lastly but not least-ly, selfbots cannot seem to be able to react to posts, meaning that if you want to switch your autorole to a more interactable and less prone to failure (such as Discord API being down and the role not auto-assigning, for example), you should probably switch to a role-on-react system, such as creating a reaction on your rules channel that users have to react to in order to gain access to the server at large. This does not stop people from being able to remove the ability to lose all forms of verification, however, as people might still be able to interact with reactions manually, as even if you do not have a role-on-react system, you might have a joinables channel (such as reacts to join the 'PC' role, in case your server is for a gaming community that's multi-platform).

If you do not have a bot to set up such a system, you might want to look into it as an added security, just in case. I'm going to refrain from recommend one as I figure it might be too close to self-promotion considering I'm a fellow admin on a server with someone who works on such a bot.

Past all of that, always be sure to try and set up a bot to reduce spam, as well. Some people might actually be intelligent enough to get into your server to spam it regardless, and these measures will only stop the bottiest of bots, not just people with malicious intent and a lot of time on their hands. At the end of the day, you'll need to keep a close eye to make sure you have robust measures for moderation just to be safe, even if it's a relatively small server.

I hope this post is informative and contains some new information you can make use of, and I hope we can make ourselves more informed in the ways we can fight bots as quite frankly, I'm feeling a bit silly that it took almost two weeks to figure this out and I could have spared multiple users from being pinged constantly, but hey! There it is. As mentioned previously, I'd love to hear some feedback as to why the verification system is the way that it is, as well, if possible.

Thank you for your time and sorry for the relatively long post.",10,1584792520,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fme0h2/psa_for_server_owners_admins_help_on_stopping_bot/,discordapp,1

fmc8s4,SalieriC,Mark voice channels or temporary close them,"Hello. 

I have a discord server for roleplaying games. One of the users asked me if it was possible to mark voice channels to let other users know whether the group allows people to just listen to the game or not. Is this possible? Like letting users temporary change the colour of the voice channel or something like that?

Another way would be to temporary close the voice channel to prevent other users to join the server if the group does not allow people to listen. I don't want everyone to give the permission to manage channels so the requirement would be to be able to temporary close a channel you're in (not other channels) until you (or the last person) leaves.

Is any of this possible? Any other ideas how to let people know whether the group allows listeners or not? It doesn't matter if I need to allow a bot for this or not.

But sometimes I'll hear everything fine, but then my mic isn't working, so I'll have to reconnect again. But there still the 50/50 chance of hearing everyone highpitched..

And everyone gets mad ofc because I keep connecting and disconnecting from the channel...

Is there anyone who had something like this before? Or someone who knows how to fix this..

It's **only** on the DiscordApp, the web version (and everything else) is fine.

So I decided to just exit discord and open up discord again (I'm using the web version) but it decides to do the same thing over and over again.  
I then checked google if anybody else had this same issue, but there wasn't any issues relating to mine. I checked to see if I had reduced motion on but it wasn't.  


[Yup, it wasn't.](https://preview.redd.it/g7y6mhh3lxn41.png?width=711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=46a61bf77edee77c15b0ccfea110507ff6350aed)

So I decided to enable autoplay on gifs but it apparently it says this.

I don't really get this at all, does anyone have a fix for this or do I have to switch to the app version?

This is a bot suggestion for someone to make which is supposed to be a helpful for schools to verify students.
Each student gets an ID code to verify them into the server. When they join this bot will DM them and ask them to reply with their ID number.
Once verified they can get the roles/ranks (eg. Headteacher verifies so gets the Headteacher role) and they can get their roles.

EXAMPLE:
My ID could could be 1234
When I join the server...
Verification bot sends me a dm asking for ID
I reply with 1234
The bot gives me all the roles I need
Roles examples: Form/Tutor Group Role, Subject Lesson Roles, 
Also the bot will update their nickname to their full name.",1,1584749601,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fm5ss4/bot_suggestion_to_help_verify_schools_discord/,discordapp,1

I defenitely hope someone can help me with my issue. 

I'm speaking with people over discord, everything there looks setted up nicely. Then randomly from time to time and only with certain people, the sound goes crazy (like the slanderman game). I happens around 3-5 times per hour.

It happens with 2 people most likely. I thought about electromagnetic interferences. The problem is that it only happens with those 2 people on different servers and I play everyday with many people. On the other hand, I'm the only one to notice this sound. 

The issue is that one of them is my main mate...

fm2j8m,Vitia_Sei,I found a cool glitch that lets people use their cameras in server voice chat,"So this just happened, I was in voice chat with a few friends as per usual, one of them needed some help so they turned on screen share and showed us what was going on, after helping her she stopped streaming and I went back to a text channel, but then I used the Ctrl+k shortcut to go to my DMs ; then the magic happened, it instead brought me to a full screen view of the voice channel, just like when you're in a private group call, which allowed me to turn on my camera. 

We replicated the glitch a bit so everyone could open this screen and now we're in server video conference. 

To replicate :

Have someone in the voice chat turn on stream (stream anything), everyone else then jumps into the stream, stop the stream, then click on a text channel, use Ctrl+k, your ""last channel"" should be the voice channel you were watching the stream in, press enter, enjoy. 

I hope this doesn't break discord TOS or anything, if it does I will delete this post and report the glitch to the appropriate service, but I also hope it can make some game nights more fun for some people !",5,1584737576,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fm2j8m/i_found_a_cool_glitch_that_lets_people_use_their/,discordapp,1

I looked it up and found solutions that all tell me to turn off hardware acceleration (tried, didn't work) and turn off quality of service high priority packet stuff (also tried, didn't work.) and so what should I do now?

flxwh2,sm44wg,"Temporary fix for very quiet mic on discord only (3,5mm jack)","I've had the issue with very quiet mic on discord even though all mic volume settings are on max and other apps work properly. Today I was again trying to fix it reinstalling all drivers and stuff but nothing seemed to work and I still don't know of a permanent fix. But I did accidentally find a temporary solution.

I managed to fix it for a session by going to discord browser (Chrome) version mic test, allowing discord to access my mic on browser. Somehow my volume on desktop app discord was fixed to acceptable levels too. Doing another mic test on the desktop version reset the mic volume to extremely low again on BOTH browser and desktop app. Removing discord web apps mic access and reallowing it fixed the volume again.

So mic test on desktop only will make my volume low, and resetting mic permission and doing mic test on browser will always make my volume ""normal"" even in the desktop app. If I keep the browser mic test on all the time it works perfectly on both. If I end browser mic test and keep on the desktop mic test it'll work until I turn off desktop mic test AND alt tab to anything so discord isn't active window. Then the volume will be low on browser and desktop and resetting browser mic permissions allows the browser version to fix the volume again.

So for anyone trying to work-around the low mic volume on disc you could try to open the web browser, reset permissions and then do mic check and switch back to desktop app, do mic test, turn off desktop mic test, join call, turn off or mute browser mic test. Jumping back and forth between the apps will end the ""fix"" if your browser mic test is off.

If anyone can suggest a better fix I'd be all ears. Maybe this will help troubleshoot the issue",0,1584721688,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/flxwh2/temporary_fix_for_very_quiet_mic_on_discord_only/,discordapp,1

flxn0p,Wolfhearte,Friend's mic sound is awful in discord calls &lt;NEED HELP FIXING&gt;,"Here's the breakdown, my friend got a Samsung a50s a couple months ago and we talk on discord a lot videos calls and voice channel and the audio from their mic sounded good. Recently their phone had an update and it reset all the phone's settings. Now any type of call in Discord (video and audio calls) my friend sounds completely awful. It sounds like a noise suppression and very muffled, but not robotic. We've tried many things to fix it: Tried of course turning off noise cancelling and all the settings there, tried changing over to call mode as well as communication mode,tried turning the input sensitivity bar all the way down (which used to sound amazing but now doesn't effect anything). Tried changing mics, tried unplugging mic to use phone's built in mic and it sounds literally exactly the same, no difference in quality if headset mic plugged in or not. Even tried using the opensl es settings. No setting in discord effects the mic sound nor does and different mic, I also notice in video call the video is much more laggy and choppy. Their internet is fine and it is same issue whether they are using data or wifi. I really feel like the issue is a simple fix but I just can't figure out what might be creating the conflict. It almost feels like discord is being SUPER limited in bitrate like a call, and the last bit of info I have is when it DOES sound good is when there is the connection issue and says connecting and it suddenly sounds great like in the photo I posted but as soon as they refresh the connection it sounds terrible again. If anyone knows how to fix this issue MUCH thanks in advance!

flw9uh,Mr_DJA,I just made a bot can change your text color on chat using webhooks!,"Sounds crazy, but I made a Discord bot that basically can change your text color on chat, yeah!

How? It's simple, I used webhooks.

That's a feature you can give to your active members on your Discord server, or anything else it's up to you.

[preview](https://preview.redd.it/16c7wqrlbun41.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=899699ebcfcf27ade763e19556a3259c2b0542ca)

    Commands:
    
    +help [command name] =&gt; A dynamic help command.
    +c &lt;color name/hex&gt; &lt;text&gt; =&gt; Send a colored message. Example: +c gold hi
    +cm &lt;color name/hex&gt; =&gt; Enable color mode.
        Example: +cm gold

Note: Giving an invalid color will make the text transparent, make sure to use HTML colors or hex codes.

&amp;#x200B;

So you send your command you give args, the bot will delete your message, then the system will use an npm package to convert that text to an image, it will apply the given color to it:

          textToImage
            .generate(text, {
              maxWidth: 400,
              fontSize: 14,
              fontFamily: ""Whitney Book Regular"",
              lineHeight: 22,
              margin: 0,
              bgColor: ""#00000000"",
              textColor: color
            })
    

It will create a webhook with the user name and the avatar, then It will send a message with the rendered image:

     message.channel.createWebhook(`${message.author.tag}`, `${message.author.displayAvatarURL}`)
     .then(wh =&gt; {...}

fluxri,Gjdass,iOS notifications are not going away,"Hello. 

Something known for years now. Found several posts here on Reddit (archived). I also did 2 support tickets. One of them was 2 years ago where discord staff answered they would fix it. 

Well, it’s still here : if you have X notifications in the same channel, clicking and going on one of them won’t clear the rest of the notifications for that channel like it should. Any other app like signal, telegram, WhatsApp, messenger, iMessage, whatever will behave like that : if I click on one discussion notification, every other notification for that particular discussion will go away (it’s in fact logic).

I’m a member of 5 active servers. It’s a nightmare to clean manually every notification I had during the day whereas I already read all the channel concerned. 

Please discord, after all those years, can you finally fix this very very very annoying and basic bug ?
That would be soooooo perfect.

I'm trying make new friends. So I saw someone who was interested in coding, which is my field of expertise as well. So I casually DMmed him saying hi and mentioning about Coding. He replied Get Out. I get it. I don't bother if they don't like it. So I apologized and went back to General Lounge Chat. That person was named ""QSmally"". I don't remember the tag number. He's the moderator as well. He banned me from the entire server when I was chatting in the Lounge Chatroom. Now I can't access it. This just makes me feel terrible. It was a totally invalid and unfair move.

But if you're listening, beautiful Discord programmers: fix this ASAP, because new people are starting to discover this program, and this may ruin their experiences and stop them from adopting this program.

flrc10,Brrunt,Need Voicemeeter Help w/2 Accounts (Screen Sharing Audio Not Working),"Title summarizes it pretty well.

Discord Screen/Game Sharing is busted as the audio doesn't come through. I've exhausted most avenues such as: resetting audio, updating drivers, reinstalling, turning on the overlay??? and more, but would still appreciate any suggestion at this point tbh because it would remove the necessity of this post.

Issue: Game Audio not coming through from screen sharing

Solution (that i need help on): I'm running two instances of discord.

I have a main account, an alt account, and then the 3rd-party viewer.

Main account does NOT stream while the alt is used to stream.

I've configured my Voicemeeter by the process of [this video](https://youtu.be/b5TpjNmkRYY) with the thought process of replacing the context of OBS with the second discord account that would be streaming the game. The problem manifests in the fact that the OUTPUT that OBS would receive is what the screen-sharing alt discord account would NEED to see as an INPUT to share game audio with the server/call.

I understand that I'm essentially asking how to finish this by adding the extra step of routing the already completed output as in input, but my brain is exhausted with this stuff so massive kudos to the audio geniuses out there, hopefully willing to do me a huge favor.

To summarize once more:

2 Discord Accounts: Main is in Call/Server listening and using a microphone. Alt is used as a Screen/Game Share without listening to the Discord output that needs to be heard by me on the Main Account.

Massively appreciate anyone willing to take this on for me and if anyone has simpler solutions that I obviously cannot come up with, those are also welcome.",0,1584691776,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/flrc10/need_voicemeeter_help_w2_accounts_screen_sharing/,discordapp,1

I don't have a ton of experience using discord - so I'm here asking if anyone have any helpful tips, add-ons, or community suggestions to include on such a server.

flibw5,DiscoLove_,Looking for help with a moderation dilemma: trying to strike a balance between not giving moderators too much control over server settings vs fair moderation,"Hello all.  I own a public Discord server that has quickly drawn in a sizable community in a very short period of time and I imagine it may begin growing even faster (as the game it has been set up for has not even released yet).

I am currently facing the following dilemma...

I came across an interesting approach to moderation on another Discord server; that server setup a role called ""In Mediation"" where basically this role would be assigned to users that were acting up / breaking server rules.  Once assigned, this role would force the individual into hidden ""mediation"" channels to further discuss what was going on while blocking them from all other channels.

I tried implementing this aforementioned approach on my server, but immediately ran into the following problem:  I *want* my mods to be able to assign this role to users, BUT I *don't want* my mods to be able to make edits (to the permissions) to those respective roles on the server.

Now, I *can* THINK of a solution to this problem, but I don't think that solution can be executed within Discord; this wouldn't be an issue if there was an option to *allow* certain roles the ability to ASSIGN (and de-ASSIGN) roles, but at the same time *NOT allow* those roles to make edits to permissions of roles equal to or below them in the role hierarchy of the server.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone here have any solutions or suggestions for how I should proceed?  I'm very open to any suggestions regarding other approaches to fair moderation as well.",7,1584653693,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/flibw5/looking_for_help_with_a_moderation_dilemma_trying/,discordapp,2

fli4kh,Sefbk,Having a massive problem with Discord Mobile I've never heard anyone talk about,"TL;DR my Discord Mobile app crashed one day, started working again months later, and today it's crashed again and I don't know what to do.

Hi everyone. I've never posted on Reddit before, but I'm pretty frustrated with Discord and could use some advice. Back in December 2019, I was voice chatting with some friends one day when Discord randomly crashed. I tried to open it again and was met with the loading screen with a small spinning wheel under the logo. The app stayed on that loading screen forever. And no matter what I did, I couldn't get the app to work again.

I tried deleting and reinstalling the app, restarting my phone, force quitting the app, and various combinations of all of those things. I set my phone so it wouldn't shut off automatically and left it on the loading screen for thirty minutes, but nothing changed. I communicated with a Discord support person for several weeks, but we didn't get anywhere. Eventually I ended the support email thread because I was overwhelmed with other stuff going on at the time. I resigned myself to only using Discord on my laptop until I got a new phone.

Then, in February 2020, the app started working again. I don't know what I did differently, though I think I'd had the app uninstalled for a few weeks. Everything was going fine until today. I tried to open the app and, to my horror, the loading screen with the spinny wheel is back. I wasn't even voice chatting this time! What caused the glitch?

I would really like to have Discord working on mobile during this time of crisis. Does anyone have any similar experiences to this? And does anyone have any advice on how to fix it?

flffrw,Cubo_CZ,Problem with nicknames,"(Sorry if this post doesn't belong here. I did notice that the rules say no bug reports, but I don't think this classifies as a bug. Also, when I looked into how to report a bug, it just seemed like this wouldn't fit into a bug report.)

I found an error in discord that seems like it could be easily fixed. Basically, you cannot give someone a nickname that is the same as their username. Now, why is this a problem? Let me explain.

Let's imagine a scenario where you want everyone to have their nickname formated in one way. So you, as an admin, give them their appropriate nickname, and remove their permission to change it. Now they permanently have the nickname set. Simple.

But what if their username already fits the nickname criteria? What if it's already formated correctly? Most people would think it harmless and leave it be. But there's a difference. This user doesn't have a nickname set, which means that when they change their username, their name on the server changes as well, since they don't have a nickname.

Well let's give them a nickname! Well, you can't. You can't give them a nickname that's the same as their username. At least when you give them a nickname that's not the same as their username and they then change their username to match their nickname, the nickname stays set.

But this is a serious problem for admins like me that run a server that has specific nicknaming guidelines. All that needs to be done to fix this is to allow users to set nicknames that are the same as their usernames.

So, please discord, change this. Thank you for reading this, by the way.",0,1584644052,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/flffrw/problem_with_nicknames/,discordapp,1

With any new feature, we always set out to build the best experience possible, and any time we ship something new, it's because we believe it will make the experience of being on Discord better. Your feedback plays a huge part in the success of this process, so thank you for taking time out of your day to do this for us.

I'd like to cover two changes we're making to Discord as a result of that feedback process. First, we are introducing [Reduced Motion](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/) in order to alleviate the burden that excess visual motion within our app is causing users. This is a desktop only feature to start, and we’ll bring it to mobile in the future! Second, we are relocating Quick Reactions under the right click menu in order to align its intention to an appropriate location.

**Introducing Reduced Motion**

Reduced Motion is a new setting available under [User Settings &gt; Appearance &gt; Accessibility ](https://imgur.com/R587GoU)which is intended to help anyone who might feel distracted or disoriented by motion on a screen (particularly animations and other effects that try to emulate ""natural"" or ""realistic"" movements, or are especially large or fast). With this setting enabled, Discord limits animations, transitions, and other effects throughout the app to help keep things grounded, less distracting, and most importantly, less disorienting for those who need it most.

**When Reduced Motion is Enabled:**

* No more screen shaking when you encounter an error on a settings page.
* Animated gifs and emojis in chat will only play when you hover over them.
* The highlight that appears on a message when mouse hovering is disabled.
* Bouncing effects are removed when modal windows like User Profiles come in and out.
* The login screen has a whole lot less movement.
* And plenty more!

For a lot of people, these animations help the app feel natural and polished, and more often than not, they aren’t noticeable until you start looking for them. However, for some users these subtle effects can have major consequences.

Starting today, this setting will be set to sync automatically with your OS settings and you can always make changes based on your preferences. It’s important to note this is our first pass at Reduced Motion, and there’s still some panels (like for Nitro and Boosting) that contain motion. We think this setting is in a good place to give to you guys to use as we work on other things, and we’ll loop back to it after we finish up the other accessibility focused features we’ve got in production.

**Adjustment to Quick Reactions**

We’re also making a change to the recent feature, [Quick Reactions](https://imgur.com/ktVIaWA), after hearing the unanimous feedback that the feature wasn’t providing the benefit we intended. Originally, we designed the feature to allow users easy access to their top used emotes - but we understood that this was causing more of a nuisance and interrupting the chatting experience for most people.

There are now two alternative ways implemented for easy access to reacting:

1. **Right Click:** We relocated your top four emojis into the right click menu so you don’t lose the quick access, but make sure you’re still able to actually read your chat while reacting. You can right click anywhere on a message to show the emojis.
2. **Add Reaction Button:** We opted to keep the button next to the three-dot menu as it’s out of the way enough and still allows you access to *all* of your emojis vs just the top 4.

When taking in feedback from our community, we understand there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for making Discord both accessible and enjoyable for all users. Different people have different needs and preferences, and it's our responsibility to respect those and ensure that everyone who wants to use Discord can, and can do so comfortably. As we continue to grow, we are invested in hearing how our changes make a measurable impact on the way you use Discord (whether good or bad, we’re here for it all). If you want to proactively keep up with the changes we make to Discord, we have a few ways to get this info depending on what you’re interested in:

1. **Canary Client:** This is where all new features land first, it’s our testing playground if you will. You can download it based on your platform here: [Windows](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=win), [Mac](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=osx) and [Linux](https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux).
2. **A11Y Feedback:** To address accessibility concerns proactively, we have a Google form where you can submit specific feedback on accessibility concerns within Discord found [here](http://dis.gd/a11y). There’s also a specific [section](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/360001549952-Accessibility) for accessibility on our Feedback site.
3. **General Feedback:** We surface feedback from multiple places, including our [Feedback site](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/topics), Reddit, Twitter, and our [support desk](http://dis.gd/support)!

Thanks again for always sending feedback our way so we can continue to improve Discord and provide a better experience for everyone on our platform. I'm excited to show you what we’ve got in store for the future, so stay tuned!",83,1584641876,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/flesus/adding_reduced_motion_quick_reactions_change/,discordapp,3

fleb5p,TheDeerssassin,Having audio issues on my new computer and it seems to be all centered around Discord.,"Might be the wrong place to post, might not even be a Discord issue, I'm really not a tech person so I don't know what the real problem is or where else to post is so I'm just gonna ask here. 

Just got a new laptop a couple days ago and I'm having two main problems with Discord. I got into a call with a friend, and we got on a game. But as soon as we got into a match, audio for both just stopped and discord stopped picking up my mic. Leaving and rejoining the call let me talk to my friend again, but then it happens again when the next match starts. And the game's audio doesn't come back till I restart the game. 

Then the second issue is just notifications not making any noise. I got on notification earlier that did make a noise, but that noise was only a loud buzzing sound, and every notification following that makes nothing. Kinda panicking here because playing games and talking to friends is kinda all I do with my time and I have no idea how to fix all of this",2,1584640161,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fleb5p/having_audio_issues_on_my_new_computer_and_it/,discordapp,1

fldwnz,yesImJeff,Newbie wanting to use Discord to have video &amp; discussion afterwards for a church group that can't meet because of COVID-19. Will it work for that? Any recommendations?,"I'm wondering if someone can play the DVD on their Mac and do a screenshare in Discord and everyone else can watch &amp; then participate in a group discussion afterwards?

I set up a separate server for a few groups, though only one has had anyone join it yet.

**Background:** I am active in a few organizations that are being impacted by COVID &amp; can no longer meet in person until...?

My son uses Discord for gaming &amp; had me do it a little bit when he was trying to teach me a little bit of coding. It worked well for that with the screenshare &amp; audio conferencing. It seems like it should work for those various small groups &amp; others like them.

I've talked at least a couple of people in ""That Man Is You"" into trying it for our Saturday morning video &amp; discussion afterwards. We had been getting 7 to 12 participants per week, but many had dropped out because it started so early in the morning because of room availability. Perhaps we might be able to get even more participants if we can move the time back some... and people may have more free time with this lockdown going on.

Any recommendations, pointers, or advice would be most appreciated.

Thank you.",6,1584638795,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fldwnz/newbie_wanting_to_use_discord_to_have_video/,discordapp,1

fldia2,Nickname128,Discord random pink spikes.,"I've been using Discord for quite some time now ( 3 years) and there is a big issue I've encounteres a few months ago that really annoy me. Sometimes Discord just has random pink spikes out of nowhere. I've tried several fixes already (like approving it in the firewall, restarting rooter etc.). And slowly I am running out of options. Here is the thing, it is not my Internet that causes those pink spikes, because on every other software similar to Discord (like Skype, Teamspeak and Steam Chat) those spikes dont happen. I made a side by side comparison, I was in a call on Steam while being in a channel on Discord, only on Discord it showed me ping spikes, while on Steam everything was perfectly normal, even in-game everything was perfectly fine, no high-ping whatsoever. So I'm wondering, why is it that Discord at some point just suddenly bugs out while the whole Internet itself is working normal?

There are no youtube tutorials on this topic and reading plain text doesn't really help me. I'd like to just follow some steps while clearly seeing what to (by watching videos or pictures that explain the steps), but apparently there are none.

I know how to make a bot, get the tokens that I'll be needing and stuff like that, but this knowledge isn't needed, because I don't know how to have the bot tag myself.

fl8d1v,Cyoor,Limit what people can read in a channel,"Hi!  


(TL;DR at the bottom)  
I am the owner of a kind of big discord channel. We have a channel where we have question/answer section. The problem with this section is that it becomes a bit of a debate channel instead of just answering a specific question with statements.  
We have tried to make it a slow mode channel, but that does not prevent people from writing about other peoples questions.  


What we would want is some kind of restriction so that a person only can see his/her own messages and messages from officials answering questions in the channel.  
Is there any way to set that up?  


That would make it more of an official statements channel where people could make comments / ask questions without making it a mess. Answering the messages would be done easy by quoting that person and give an official statement about the message.

Thanks in advance.

But why ? The reason I managed to find the more valuable is for safety of the users.  
Problem is that the discord team can't truly control the content of your computer so they can't control if you have a third party client. This is a security breach that is wide open for everyone.

Is there a way to get a Discord Bot to send notifications to a text channel when a spreadsheet has been edited? (In other words, I'm trying to get notifications when someone responds to a Google Form.)

I've looked up many Discord x Google Sheet integration bots but they all seem to be relating to posting a command and then having the Google Sheet row be pasted into the chat, or something of the sort. I've tried a couple of bots as well but they don't seem to be what I'm looking for, either.

I've tried Zapier and it did not work at all - The bot might be down or something, but it didn't work at all. That was the closest thing I could find to a Google Sheets x Discord Bot thing - But I don't even know if it was what I was looking for even if it did work out. 

I've only looked as far as the first 5 pages of Google and it's possible I'm missing something so obvious, or a popular post that explains what I'm looking for.

My microphone in Discord distorts. Terribly.

I've tested in Windows Sound Settings and the UAD Console and it sounds fine in both. I also boot my computer into Windows AND MacOS often and the issue persists in both systems. This problem ONLY appears to be in Discord. I've played with every setting imaginable, including Discord settings, changing sample rate, and anything else I can think of.

fkukyk,PlexversalHD,Sooo this is the beginning of server owners starting to getting money from boosts...,"So in the PAX community discord there was [an announcement](http://prntscr.com/rikkqw) on Monday, and one line struck out: 

_Starting today, our server will begin getting a part of the money used to boost the server!_

Now in that announcement that was the only mention of it, nothing about where the money goes and nothing about why this change was granted. Just more mentions of why people should boost, more server features yadar yadar.

Also would be worth mentioning the owner of the server does not work for discord but does mod this subreddit and obviously close to discord staff.

**So what does this actually mean**

Well firstly, this could only be for this server, I personally have not seen this applied to any other server, there has been no details mentioned or announcements in official servers and neither in the partner server that I have seen, so this could be a one time thing.

EDIT: [seems other servers are also getting it](http://prntscr.com/rikurd)

I would say that if this is going to be wide spread thing to more server owners then its obvious this would be a tactic try get server owners to motivate people to boost, in turn making discord money. Of course great marketing move, except... this is inevitably going to make server owners restrict things to almost make people boost, I feel like this can get ugly and discord probably knows this hence no mention of this.

I also feel this may end up getting restricted to partners only or something, which would of course be unfair and make normal server owners pissed.

Only time will tell how this may end up and if it even goes out to other server owners but I can see this making discord servers turn ugly pretty fast, arguments with mods, hard restrictions etc etc.",3,1584556572,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fkukyk/sooo_this_is_the_beginning_of_server_owners/,discordapp,1

fkjshg,eixxxx,Discord for Workplace!,"Hi guys!

I’m personally not a gamer but we were looking for alternative tools for working from home in regards to COVID outbreak. Discord is such a perfect tool for this period of time and my team is loving it to the core. We are a young team of a 18-people-start-up so adapting to it is not a problem.

It is so much faster than Slack with voice chat room and live streaming in groups. We get to interact with each other more online using sending memes, streaming games and DJing in a separate channel as well. Our productivity boosted up a lot by using Discord. The interactions between members are much more alive.

I’m learning that there were bots that could be useful moderating the server as well but from what I’ve found so far it is suitable for gaming.

Do you have suggestions for me to find bots or webhooks for workplace I.e. connecting the server with google calendar, set up reminders, syncing it with JIRA, bitbucket, CD/CI with GCP? Or any hacks that you’ve found so far?

fki309,suicidaldiscordban,Last straw in the game of life,"So, I got banned from discord. This isn’t one of those stupid pity posts; I don’t care for nor want your pity. Getting banned is pretty bad in of itself. Discord means a lot to me, and it’s discord that has talked me off the bridge (so to speak, not actual bridges) 3 times. It also gave me the first and so far only meaning and purpose in life I’ve ever had. 

I got banned because I sent poorly worded messages, which were quickly taken out of context and reported by a moderation helper I criticized, hoping to get me banned. Obviously it succeeded. I knew the support team would come in for me (they aren’t idiots).

This wasn’t the last straw. I was fully willing to buy a vpn description to enjoy life if the support team didn’t see reason. I think anybody would. 

But what happened next was the last straw. I listed reasons why I use and require discord, in addition the the numerous reasons my ban was false. It doesn’t hurt to pile on some extra reasons to unban me. Among them was that I was helping a suicidal person. They were completely reliant on me, the only person they have ever trusted. I didn’t want them to die, because they certainly would if I abandoned them. Their parents track everything and know she has attempted suicide but don’t care. CPS did nothing. All hopes had been exhausted, including professional and legal. 

So when I emailed support, I did not expect them not care about anything. Though it was not stated, the sentiment was clear: we don’t give a fuck about righteousness or justice, and the only thing we care about is that that person doesn’t commit suicide (they provided links that I had explicitly told them earlier had been used and that they lie to therapists and their parents lie to authorities. The underlying reason was clear to me. Maybe I’m seeing the negative part, but what I read in between the lines was, we don’t care if they die, but it would look bad for our company. 

I hope I’m reading this wrong. I really hope I do, a lot. I’m still talking to support. I realize the support team are humans(I’ve interned on some support teams myself and they are always talked down to by customers) but the veil effect is strong. Stronger than humanity, as is proven time and time again. 

I don’t know what to say. I was on the verge of suicide before I even got banned. I don’t know what I will do now. Discord keeps me alive, it’s a place to vent and talk and learn new things, it’s because of discord I went from d’s in all classes to a perfect gpa. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this. I feel like this is turning into a pity train. There is no point to this message, really. You’ll never know the end result and it doesn’t affect you. I just needed a place to write this, and a hope for justice in the world.

I wanted to ask what the expected upload bandwidth usage is for the Go Live / Streaming feature. I do not have Discord Nitro so I am using just 720p/30fps. When I check my router, it says that my PC only has an upload speed of ~2Mbps while I have a total of 100 Mbps from my internet plan (router actually says 118Mbps from a speed test result). I confirmed that nothing else is consuming the Upload bandwidth. 

My friends complain that my stream is often blurry / pixelated / laggy so I'm trying to figure out what the expected Upload requirement is and if there is anything else I can do to fix it. Any tips to improve quality would be much approved.

Also on a final note, I have tried Discord Nitro so I could use 1080p or Source/60fps but that didn't change anything (which I suppose is to be expected if I can't get good quality 720p/30fps).",5,1584487231,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fkfax5/average_upload_speed_when_using_go_livestreaming/,discordapp,1

I plug out my first jack, sound is gone. Put it back, sound is back. Plug out my second one, sound is gone. Plug it back in, sound is back.

Me and my friends own a ps4 and we shareplay and chat in the party. But lately, there are some games that I want to show, or shareplay with my friends on another console, such as games from the ps2 or wii or switch. The only thing I've thought of is having both consoles run at the same time, being on the ps4 party with friends while I use the other console to play a NON ps4 game. That however doesn't solve the shareplay problem, but I heard from someone else that you can use discord. I don't know much about discord, and I don't know if they have a shareplay feature, but what matters to me the most is that my friends are able to see and hear what I'm playing.

However, I don't know what bot to use for this function.

I want a bot that will be able to announce the time according to the timezone set every hour. Not to the 30-minute-mark, but to every hour, since everybody's 30 minute mark will be the same anyway. I also want to be able to confine its posting to one channel in the server, a dedicated timekeeping channel. That way people can just glance in and go, ""Oh, cool, it's \[insert time here\], the perfect time to do that thing I wanted to do in the RP.""

The only type of thing I've seen that's similar is some sort of interval thing, and even then, I don't think you can make the interval command change according to what hour it is.

fjxcmo,faradaycat,Per-server Game Activity &amp; Privacy Settings,"With discord positioning itself to try to provide a communication platform for people quarantining for coronavirus, I think it would be a good time to point out that the privacy settings PER SERVER are quite limited.

At current, the only option that you're given, on a per-server basis, is to stop randoms DMing you. That's all well and good, but what if I'm in a server for school and I don't want to share my game status with the teacher and my peers there? Right now, my only option is to BLANKETLY turn it off for my account, which, if you use discord for communal gaming, might be a bit of a bummer. It's the same for discord connections: right now, you can set your connected accounts (steam, twitch, spotify, blizzard, twitter, etc etc) to be visible either to EVERYBODY, or NOBODY.

I would advocate for these types of settings to either be configurable per-server (so that more professional acquaintances don't see me playing HENTAI SNIPER: Middle East) or that I have configurable profiles (with settings for game activity, connections, and even icon) on my account that I can use on a per-server basis: the idea there being that changes made to the profile reflect all servers I'm using it on, consolidating settings.",0,1584411733,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fjxcmo/perserver_game_activity_privacy_settings/,discordapp,1

As far as i know discord is partnering with microsoft and its also possible to link your xbox account to your discord profile to show the games you are currently playing. 

Xbox is having an exclusive xbox party to let players talk and communicate regardless of the game they are playing. same for playstation but also exclusive for their system.

Since Crossplaying is becoming more and more popular, there should be a way to easily communicate between the different systems. Using in gamechat in these crossplay games is possible, but it is only working if you are in the same lobby and the sound quality and input lag is depending on the game you are playing.  Right now you could use skype on xbox (Im not sure it is on playstation). But discord would be optimal since it is designed for gamers.

According to this: [https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#editing-the-embedded-message-content](https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/embeds.html#editing-the-embedded-message-content)

&gt;By default, up to 3 fields will display inline. If a thumbnail is set, this will change to 2

But I'm using thumbnail and it doesn't help.

fjr9ya,Arch_345,Can't hear notifications sound from Overlay,"So i've been dealing with this issue for like 3/4 weeks now and it's really annoying me.

I already sent a ticket but i doubt something will change.

So basically, if use Discord not in game everything works completely fine.The issue starts whenever i open a game.

If i recieve a message or a call, i can see the notification showing up but can't hear any sound.It's not bothering me that much for the calls as the notification box is bigger than the text one, but if i recieve a text message while i'm playing something that i'm really focused on, i can easily miss the message and only see it whenever i close or alt-tab out of the game.

I tried pretty much everything at this point.Uninstalling Discord, Checking for audio errors on my pc, updating both Windows and Discord, sending logs via tickets to the devs, cheched the audio settings, turning off/on hardware accelleration, turning off/on streamer mode.

At this point i'm hopeless and i don't know if it'll ever fix itself but it's worth asking on this subreddit.

Thanks anyway to whoever took the time to read this and i really hope someone has a fix for it.

If not, i think i'll just leave with it and miss all the future messages from friends.",4,1584388659,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fjr9ya/cant_hear_notifications_sound_from_overlay/,discordapp,1

fjqd8a,MingeyMackrel,When is a bot not a bot,"So I am a mod on a very small time server for me, some friends, and some friends of friends. We tightly regulate bots and stuff to some small channels and I'm pretty familiar with the interface.   


So our problem begins with the creator of the channel. He watches RTGame and follows his discord. Unfortunately, he decided to put a thing (it isn't a bot for reasons I'll get into later) on the channel to give him updates from his discord. But lately he has gotten tired of it cluttering his feed, and isn't happy about the spam hitting his phone at all hours. So he wants to get rid of it.  


I take hop on, and decide to remove the bot from the channel and move it to a new one where it can be muted. But low and behold, I cant seem to find it on the bar to the right. ""That's odd"" I think while I try to ban it from the server altogether. But that doesn't work either. The bot's profile is just a link to his discord. It's not like any other bot I've ever seen, the only option is to delete each post individually.

I'm putting up a Discord server and, while i try to understand the Avrae bot commands, i'd need some quick answer about Discord itself:

\- there's an easy way to write in different colors? (other than the \`\`\` tricks: there's not that key on italian keyboards) I tryed to use ""Roles"" (Narrator for the ""fluff"", Master for the ""mechanics"") but seems that i can't switch roles.

\- if not, is it possible to have two accounts? one using the browser and one the executable, perhaps?

\- can i ""embed"" PDF or other documents for the players in the server? I see i can attach images in post, what i mean is something ""always available"" they can open and read as willing (so, character sheets, player aids, current map, etc)

I help moderate a sports team, and we're moving to Discord because of the COVID19 situation. I wanted to know if there were bots that had some moderation capabilities as well as some fun things (like magik and deepfry or cute images). However, all the bots I have looked at have had some NSFW or 'edgy' things that I don't really want for a school sports team. For example, some have commands to get dank memes or 'ligma balls', and I don't want to have to deal with any offensive possibilities. Are there bots that either don't have any edgy things or ways I can block certain commands?

Since the Covid-19 apparead, the autorithies of my country closed the schools and as a teacher I need to find a way to keep working with my students. I guess that Discord is a very good choice for distance learning since I can interact with my students in many ways (chatting, uploading  links, files or videos...).  I can as well stream by sharing my screen and show them some stuff. But since I am on MacBook Pro it seems I can't make any video calls with the app  (I don't find this feature anywhere) ! Is it just not avaible on MacOs ?

I have a PC Windows as well at home so I can install discord on this computer to make it work for sure but then are the video calls going to work if some of my students are on MacOS ? I am asking this question because this computer has no webcam so I need to buy one and I want to know if it is worth.

fj8p1v,OntologicalSeraph,Does Discord punish users for establishing certain server-exclusive policies?,"Let me specify. Does Discord punish their users for creating and enforcing policies that they might deem ""in violation"" of their TOS? For example, my server currently has a policy that states the following:

The “Deserved Treatment Policy”, or “DTP”, also known as the “Fair Treatment Policy”, is a policy native to this server stating that those who deserve to be treated unfairly, should be, and that taking this responsibility to an excessive level (bullying instead of criticizing) is in no way endorsed by its owners. The owner defines ""bullying"" as being \*unjustifiably\* hostile towards someone, not just being senselessly hostile or toxic for the sake of it.

Basically, this policy means that we allow users to insult and criticize others, as long as they have an objectively-measured, justified, and understandable reason for doing so. Say someone starts dox'ing another user for literally no reason whatsoever other than to cause damage, and the user being doxed starts egregiously insulting that person in our server. Me, as well as my Judicial Council (ethics committee) would allow it on the grounds that it is entirely understandable to be angry at another person for doing such a thing, and to feel the need to express it in the server where it happened. We acknowledge that humans have painfully human responses to damaging or hateful things, which is why we can tolerate it, and why we allow it. However, we also make it very clear that taking this criticism one step too far \*will\* result in your punishment, such as excessive racial slurs that can offend entire demographics, causing others to potentially get involved in the drama. Anything that could act as a catalyst for more widespread drama is where we draw the line on what we're willing to tolerate from an understandably angry person. Despite this, I feel as though Discord would consider this ""violating TOS"", as it's very easy to twist what we believe into something like ""they enable bullying and user harassment"". And although that's true \*to a degree\*, it \*NEEDS\* to be noted that we only allow such things under very strict circumstances \*AND\* supervision (moderators would be actively watching the dispute to ensure that excess strides are not taken). I'm constantly being reassured by my staff that this is not the case, and that Discord would not attempt to punish me or delete my server for such a policy, although I can't be sure myself. Are policies such as these forbidden as far as Discord is concerned? Would Discord take action against me or my server for this policy?

I have taken steps to ensure that we are in no way responsible for the activities of any users, and that anything we allow is only capable of being allowed because they joined the server at their own risk and discretion and agreed to our policy and terms.

Before you're able to participate in the server at all, this is (one of) the messages you are expected to read. Once you read this, you have to react to a message in order to confirm that you are indeed on board with everything.

fitlgh,Consenter,Discord please look into this.,"Due to the influx of what is happening right now in California, I have been using Discord to contact my group mates at school for project collaboration. I don't do anything on Discord but manage a server with over 1000+ people and have a few connections that I don't have anywhere else (text, email, etc.) Today I was in a call working on a group project when my Discord suddenly logged out. I logged back in with a notice saying: Account Disabled: Please check your email.   


Checking my email, I see that my account has been disabled due to a violation of Discord TOS for posting gore content that was intended to shock others. This past week, I haven't been able to use Discord at all and only hopped on today. I don't post any content that could be harming to people and if it was NSFW, I know it would go to the corresponding channel.   


After all of this happened, I contacted discord via twitter but no reply yet. Discord as a platform is very important to me because a lot of my friends and peers use it for communication. It is now a burden because I have no mode of communication for the group project I am working on.   


After thinking about all that, I went on this subreddit and looked up ""Account Disabled"" and was left with many redditors trying to get their Discord account back with no luck. I'm really scared for my life because of those reasons stated above and would like for this to get appealed. I'm not sure if anyone has been through the same issue.

fipfu9,Jemtao,"Suggestion: True Isolated ""Do Not Disturb"" Status","The implementation can be various. This is just a suggested method, not a set-in-stone method of implementing it in.

People like to use the ""Do not Disturb"" status feature to usually talk to only a few or one individuals, but this only prevents people from talking to you via ""honor"" (or respect/common sense). However, with many people having many friends, sometimes the waters get murky and close friends end up talking to you anyway.

If you really need that private talk with someone or want to concentrate on just one conversation at a time, you can use the ""One-on-One"" talk. It shows up as a red ""Do not disturb"" when you have it set. 

The way it works is that when you set it on, a pop-up menu shows up asking you which people to ""slow down chat"" for and others who you're focused on at the moment. You can select the amount of time the ""one-on-one"" is enabled for as well as select the speed at which you receive (and perhaps send) messages to others who are currently not in your focus of conversation. 

If the person is set to this status and you're not included as a person they're talking to, you get a ClydeBot message saying something along the lines of ""This person is set to 'Do Not Disturb', they will receive your messages slower or until they're available again,"" when you send them a message.",2,1584219601,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fipfu9/suggestion_true_isolated_do_not_disturb_status/,discordapp,1

finpoz,TempoSolo,Don't really have a clue tbh. Just some shitpost tbh.," 

So, yesterday I was on discord strolling about.

I saw an gacha person. YES A GACHA USER.... and they said they were like 8 or some shit I don't know. I won't leak any user.  
And then their status was ''I might suicide.''

Then they said something like I did it for attention or something and more.  
They said they just wanted to be noticed for fame or as they said ''famse'' and I was like... wut.

He/she obviously knew what he/she was doing.

Then the next day they said they are going to do it since someone called them a ''fat, ugly stupid idiot.'' not trying to be mean or anything but I pissed myself. Dying of laughter, I obviously knew that it was fake.

Don't send me hate I'm just saying what happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue description: Discord Latency sometimes spikes, leading to me having a ""Robot Voice"" or loosing part of the things I said. Receiving is perfect all the time. 

Usually, this problem ocures when Discord is not focused, so i.e. during raiding in wow. Sometimes its fixed by focusing discord a few times.

I'm quite certain its not our WLAN, since my gf's windows laptop who is usually right next to me doesn't sport any of these issues at all. The problem ocures wether or not her laptop is on / present.

fieuay,princesszuzu98,Discord bugging out????,"My discord app on my desktop has been acting kinda buggy lately. I've un/re-installed it, but now the actual icon on my bar looks like this, (pic 1) and I'm not sure what to do to fix this. Everywhere else, even in the search engine it looks perfectly fine. (pic 2)  


How do I go about fixing this? This is going to bug me until I get it fixed. Prior to uninstalling, I had a problem where discord wouldn't even load group icons when expanding folders on the sidebar. That was a one time deal, and has fixed itself. (pic 3)  Also, using a server as an example (just my luck that i was able to scroll to where enough had default avatars) I've noticed the graphics start to glitch up a bit too, making me wonder if this really is a driver problem. #welcome and #announcements shouldn't have that black box, and there should also be an individual bar for when it says 'you're viewing older messages| jump to present"" (pic 4)  


Discord also seems to love to gray glitch me from time to time, where it would just blink a complete gray screen on me for a quick second, basically matching the gray of the chat box itself.

fi9lgp,CptRetroCharles,What auto voice bot is Sea of Thieves discord channel using?,"Hello Reddit/Discord users

I am trying to figure out what bot is being used on the Official Discord Server for Sea of Thieves 

The Auto Voice chat function that SOT discord server use lets A user click on voice channel named ""Join to Create Voice Channel"" and is automatically moved to a temporary voice channel with a preset name ""Tay is Bae #"" the number also changes as more people create new voice channels. The VC is then automatically deleted when the VC is empty.

I am not sure what discord bot they are using to have this feature in their server but would love to have to implemented in my discord server as well. If anyone has an idea please let me know.

I've tried the following AutoVC discord bots but they are missing most functions like the bot that SOT discord server uses:

VoiceMaster
Iron Justice

I have a link for screenshot of the voice channels but SUBREDDIT Rules does not allow my post with links.

If you'd like to see I can post it through message!

fi7uvy,Bevv_,Discord Toast Notifications (pop up notifications) Not working in Borderless Fullscreen,"I've been trying to solve this issue for a few months now and every solution I have come across either on this subreddit or elsewhere has not been working for me

**The issue:**

When in borderless fullscreen, in my case, games like world of warcraft. Toast notifications does not show up while that window is active.


Here's something interesting though. I run a two monitor setup, and if I make my second display my primary monitor but launch wow on the original main monitor (which is now the second). I do get toast notifications with borderless fullscreen active. Not only that, but it shows up on the same monitor as the game which is exactly what I want. 

Sadly there's too many downsides to having my second display be my primary monitor so this is not an ideal solution.

**Things I have tested so far:**

Focus assist is correctly turned off.

Notifications is turned on, discord included (in Notifications &amp; actions part of windows settings)

Complete re-install deleting appdata folders.

Updated windows

The goal is to create a bot that messages our chatroom every so often, and players can claim an egg that it posts and it is stored in their inventory. I would also like to store this value so we can bring a leaderboard up later and view how many eggs were caught. Its a cool little event idea.   


I was looking online for some good resources but I was struggling a bit. Does anyone here have any suggestions on where to look and find a good way to setup

fi4vpi,Legionof7,Discord broke our server without telling us,"Our server used to have Hypesquad Event status because of the in-person tournaments that we ran.

However, we initially were accepted into HS under a different name, Aether United. Discord decided that this was grounds for taking us off.

Yesterday, without notifying us, Discord decided to remove Hypesquad from our server. This led to our vanity URL breaking. Our URL was plastered everywhere and was the only way people could enter our server. I have no idea how many people tried to get in but couldn't, but we were only notified when someone already in our server saw the broken link on another server and contacted us.

I contacted Discord last night and they replied this morning saying

&gt;Thanks for checking in. Your HypeSquad Events application was originally accepted for the ""Aether United x Razer SF Open.""  
&gt;  
&gt;However, since you have repurposed the server and are now using the server for something else we didn't approve of, the Matrix esports team, it no longer meets HypeSquad Events requirements and has been removed at this time.   
&gt;  
&gt;If you'd like to apply for a program more suitable for your new server purpose, you'll have to wait for either Partnership or Server Verification to open up again. Since the server is no longer for a physical event, it no longer qualifies for HypeSquad Events.

&gt;Let me know if there's anything else on your mind.

I emailed them back saying that we were the same organization but they never responded. This led to us having to spend $650 (and over $1000 for the recurring subscription) on boosts just to recover the URL and allow people access to our server. Luckily we can afford this, but I'm sure that there are many organizations that can't.

tl;dr: Discord removed us from Hypesquad without notification, breaking our server. I disagree with them removing us, but that's up to them. What is absolutely unacceptable is them removing us and breaking the link **without any notification.**",10,1584126293,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fi4vpi/discord_broke_our_server_without_telling_us/,discordapp,1

fi4gg4,vxarctic,Looks for certain bot features,"In our MMORPG we have groups called statics that meet up on an agreed upon time and try to clear content in the game. We assign the statics their own locked voice and chat category, the chat consists of 4 separate rooms: Attendance updates so people can post what days they might miss or be late for with out it getting lost. A normal chat, a chat to post guides and a parse post chat. 

Is there a way to automate it so a group/static can be assigned their own voice/chat categories that are exclusive to their own group?

So for example my friends and I want to make a static, and there's a 2nd group that wants to make a static. We would do a command !make static Team 1 and it would created a lock voice and chatroom categories for Team 1. And then we'd do a command like !assign Friend to Team 1. Group 2 would make Team 2 and their own separate team 2 chat and voice categories. And say group 2 doesn't work out I could do a command to clean it up by doing !disband Team 2 and it would remove the voice and channels and the role.

Are there any bots out there that could do this?",1,1584124737,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fi4gg4/looks_for_certain_bot_features/,discordapp,1

With mobile Discord, I commonly use transparent images, however recently the images keep appearing with white backgrounds and not transparent as they should be. This only seems to happen if the image has been posted for the second (or more) times on that server.

I know the images are definitely transparent. When I go into my images gallery, it is definitely shown as such, so its not me accidentally saving it as a not-transparent image

You would also have the option to hide your server, so it doesn't get displayed on the search bar (so you can hide your cringe server).

I made a user just to make this post. When I use discord and join a server or call the audio almost always crashes. So I join and the audio just isn't there and it can also affect ofter things like games and even chrome. I tried to update drivers that I could think of, like the USB ports, headset, etc. To fix the problem I can ether replug my headset or rejoin a few times, or both. It could be a problem with my headset because it's old but not that old. I can also maybe reinstall discord. 

Plus all sounds are heavily delayed, like the sound it makes when you join a call.

fhsryc,Granoko,Roblox Account Compromised Via Screen Share,"Hello,

I would like to start this off by saying that I feel very stupid for allowing this to happen but I am hoping someone can help clarify how this person did this.

So, I received a message on Roblox from someone who claimed to be from the Fast Tracking team that wanted to verify how I recently received an increase in items. This is because yesterday, I purchased membership on my old and current account in order to move items to my new account.

In order to verify this information, this person wanted to do a Discord screenshare and for me to show them that I have enabled 2 step verification within my account. Prior to today, I've had zero experience in using Discord. So, I downloaded it onto my Windows laptop, created an account, and added the person as a friend.

We began a screensharing session and they gave me verbal instructions on what to do. I proceeded to log into the gaining account, showed that the 2 step verification feature was on, logged into the losing account and also logged into the @hotmail.com email address to show them my original account creation welcome email from 2009. When typing the passwords, visually, each character showed up as a *.

While doing all of this, this person asked me to refresh the roblox.com page several times, but they never took over the mouse from what I could see. They eventually said that everything looks good and that I am confirmed as being the original owner for both accounts. They ended the call. I then realized that all of my virtual currency (robux) and tradeable items were gone and were traded to what looked like brand new holding accounts. So it seems like while I was doing what they were instructing me to do, they were processing several trades to steal my items.

So, what I would like to know is, in a Discord screenshare, can the viewer change/move the mouse of the sharer? Or was this person able to see each key that I was typing and then just log into my account locally on their machine?

My other concern is, would they have been able to see my computer's file such as my documents and photos? I did not display these things during the screenshare but would the viewer have been able to see that on their side?

Sorry for the long story and thank you if you have read this far. I thought it would help to explain the situation in full before asking my main questions.

fhsqf7,TRUTonyBell,College Prof looking to use Discord in place of face-to-face classes - HELP!,"Hi All,

I'm very new to discord, and not sure if it will work for my purposes.  Here's what I'd like to do (please let me know if this is feasible):

Is there a way to mute everyone but me in the ""general server"" but have them not be muted in any other servers I make?

The idea here would be that I would discuss the big topic of the day, and only I could be heard in the General server, but then I'd break out students into small groups (their own smaller servers) where they could discuss things freely with open mics.

I'd also like to be able to unmute/remute one student at a time in the general server as needed (for larger discussions) - ie ""they raise their hand and I ""call on them"" by unmuting them.

Is this possible?
Do you think it would work?
Am I thinking about this wrong?
Is there a better (simpler) way?

I am a PS4 user and I have recently been playing with some friends who use PC. We communicate via discord (I use the mobile app).

The problem is that I use a headset connected to my controller for game audio and run one of my earphones with a mic from my phone to one of my ears to communicate with my friends. This is not ideal as it is uncomfortable with an earphone in under a headset.

I am wondering if anyone knows of some sort of adapter/splitter that would allow my to have just my headset connected to both phone and controller in order to have game audio and discord chat come through the headset.

fhg2cv,old-trash,False under age accusations.,"Hello,
I have been using discord for couple years now and today someone reported me for being underage. That's total lie. I'm 20 and I have been claiming that on every server I ever interacted with. 
I don't know who reported me nor why but if that was just for laughs and giggles - it wasn't funny.
Please, if you don't know someone's age and by so you want to report them, first ask them about it. Do not abuse this claims since it's very serious issue.

By writing this I just want to remind people that's super not cool for doing such thing only for stupid prank. Use report if someone is seriously validating Discord terms.

If I made any error, I'm sorry. English is not my native language.

Best wishes,

SportsBot makes running a sports server much easier and more fun. It can automate tasks such as game channel creation...

*Processing img yblhhmzs45m41...*

...and provide useful commands to members.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img xxvmqyy655m41...*

SportsBot was created back in 2017 and has quickly grown to support multiple sports (including hockey, baseball, football, basketball and more).

So far SportsBot has only been accessible through our Discord servers as a unique feature, but for the next version we are strongly considering making it public for anyone to use! SportsBot is an all-in-one combination of everything you'd need to run a sports server. We truly believe SB is a one-of-a-kind service and we'd love to share it with others &lt;3

If you're a staff member in a sports Discord server we'd really appreciate it if you could spend just a few minutes completing our survey! As a thank you, we'll provide the opportunity to beta test it before public release.

I have tried many fixes even factory resetting the phone 

The S10+ is brand new (2 weeks old) 

This mic issue doesn't exist in any other app e.g TS3 or Skype

I have even cleaned the mic with a needle and removed the little to no dust that was inside of it

I am really sad with this since now my phone sounds like a mic from the dollar store when using it.

I can get Discord to choose one scaling or the other at random when I connect/disconnect a monitor using Win+P based on God knows what, nothing works consistently nor is deterministically replicable, and it doesn't scale anything when I drag between the two monitors.

Suppose if a user posts threatening, inappropriate, nudity, hacks or any other content against TOS, Server mods technically shouldn’t delete that content if they want to report the user and wants Trust and Safety to take action on that user. 

On the other hand, Discord Community and partnered server guidelines says that mods should actively watch and delete all TOS violating content and if not deleted, results in the loss of partnered status.

fgqmoy,ReedTree,Joining channels and making calls without me,"Hey, so in the past few months I've glanced at my computer numerous times to see a recording icon which typically led me to find that Discord was either in a call with someone or connected to a voice channel on some server. At first, I assumed I'd accidentally stayed connected or accidentally clicked a voice channel, but it's happened several times now.

The other day, I walked into my room on the phone with my dad and noticed discord had joined a voice channel (which fortunately was empty as I was discussing sensitive info).

Today, I got a snapchat from a friend saying my mic was weird, and I was confused until he sent me a snap of him in a discord with me at that exact time. I wasn't even home. When I got home, I saw that my computer had initiated the call about 8 minutes after I had left the house. What's weirder is that my mic was turned off, but my friend was still receiving unintelligible audio on his end.

I'm not sure what's up, but this is a pretty big security/privacy concern.",5,1583896723,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fgqmoy/joining_channels_and_making_calls_without_me/,discordapp,1

fgary1,Antares22,Hiding roles in specific channels,"Hi everyone!
  
Is there a way to hide a role from a specific channel? Because I would like other two roles below it - along with their colours - to show up in its place, but only in that channel. 
  
For other reasons, I cannot simply change their order in the roles management tab.
  
Thanks in advance!",0,1583830021,https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/fgary1/hiding_roles_in_specific_channels/,discordapp,1
