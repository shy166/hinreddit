fsmxs0,likethesearchengine,Suggestion: Give a raid timer grace period for clients that have to reconnect.,"I have now gone MIA twice due to bugs which forced me to reconnect to the server. Both times by less than the duration of the extract timer, but even if it was a minute or two I think it would stil be a problem. In the spirit of this being an unreleased game, I make the suggestion: if your client disconnects from the server, you get that time added to your raid timer, with diminishing returns for longer disconnects. Probably 100% of the time up to 5 minutes and 50% of the time up to 10 minutes.

So for example, if you disconnect for 1 minute, you get 1 extra minute to extract. 5 minutes? 5 extra minutes. 10 minutes? 7.5 minutes. 20 minutes? 7.5 minutes.

The exact numbers can be worked on, but it breaks my heart to have a good run and then go MIA because of a bug.

Not sure how this could be abused. The amount of time added absolutely has to be less than enough to go and loot bodies without the danger of PMCs . It just has to be enough time to get to an extract from the middle of the map. Sure, maybe a little bit of edge case abuse could theoretically happen, but maybe after the timer expires, your character also can't pick up items.

Edit: maybe also only make the extra time rule occur if you disconnect and reconnect under 25% of the raid timer? 50%?",17,1585693908,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fsmxs0/suggestion_give_a_raid_timer_grace_period_for/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fsm8lk,Abomination713,Some questions from a person thinking of getting the game.,"So I'm heard of this game and seen some videos, but most of them seem random and don't have the info I'm looking for or are outdated. Was wondering if someone could answer a few random questions about the game.

1. Is this a solo or team game?
2. If I play solo do I have to fight against teams?
3. How long does a game normally take?
4. I've seen the game comes in four versions with different gear and stash sizes. Can you upgrade your stash size or is it purely locked to the version you buy?
5. Is the base games stash size too small to use?
6. Are there any kind of ballistic/riot shields in the game?
7. Is the point of the game to just kill others, get loot, leave, repeat?
8. Is there a cheating problem in this game?

fsk684,Djuthal,Latest patch have made me stop playing Tarkov,"This is a rant - I just need to get it off my chest, even though probably hundred of others have posted about the same thing.

I've been playing this game for over two years, which is highly unusual for me. I rarely have the patience to stick with a game this long. I love Tarkov, most mechanisms, etc etc., and I love much of the realism factor. However, the new weight system is still completely ridiculous, and have ruined any enjoyment with the game. Tarkov feels pointless now. The fun-factor is lost. Every time I've returned since the latest patch, I wait days until the next time I boot it up. Only to wait again. I've given it a real shot, but it just isn't fun to play anymore. Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Is it realistic?** Yes. Carrying even 40 kg is a heavy load for a trained military person. Is it fun? No. Is there any game out there where encumbrance is fun? Nope. It's used to balance the amount of stuff to carry in a game. That's the argument for Tarkov too. However, Tarkov is a looter game, and this completely takes away the point of looting when encumbrance begins at 40kg (roughly, I think). Want to do a loot run? Then skip the backpack. No point. You've successfully killed three guys? Leave most of their shit for scavs to pick up.

\- The latter point brings me to: **going in geared.** There's no point. Lvl 5/6 armor with big backpack, helmet, rig, and a fully modded weapon? You're only one weapon, a helmet and a few bits and bobs away from being severely overweight. You can throw some of your own shit out, replace it with his - but only if you didn't already destroy his armor/helmet. There's literally no point going in fully geared. If you kill someone, you need to extract right away. On maps like Interchange, the chances of PVP at spawn is huge, so if you have a quest in the building, you better just go low-geared or leave the dead guy's gear.

PVP and looting players is the essence of Tarkov. There's no other game that gives you that insanely good feeling of successfully extracting a raid with a full backpack of loot. Especially after killing a group of PMCs. However, the weight system has ruined this - at least for me.

\- **Stamina:** The fact you have to lie down to regain stamina is insane. It's the most boring function I've ever encountered in my 30 years of gaming.

\- **Skills:** As we all know, the skills are outdated and take ages for anyone to reasonably level up. The weight system COULD be good, as long as Strength and Endurance were skills you could reasonably level. The devs did recent changes, but it still takes longer than a lifetime of game time to have a level that is useful.

\- From what I understand, the weight system was partly put in place to prevent people from super-running-speed and jumping all over the map. The ""streamer"" way. I'm sure there are other solutions to fix this than a weight system.

\- **Optimisation:** Several maps still run poorly, and unless you've got a NASA PC, you can't have optics with a side-mount reflex sight. It kills the fps otherwise. The solution was to bring a sniper as back-up weapon. You can forget that now with the weight system. Kill one guy, and you have to discard your sniper.

\- **Exit campers / Interchange extracts:** We all know them, we've all heard of them. We all know there's a huge incentive to exit camp now that people can barely walk on their way to extraction. The new Interchange extractions are completely useless.

1. One where you need a friendly scav = a useless extract that few ever use. It was a fun idea on reserve, and for some reason, they've decided to add this to several maps. I'm sure the devs must have stats for this game, where it would show that the use of such extracts are very, very, very rare.
2. One where you can't have a backpack. So... it's for hatchlings and player scavs that spawned with a keycard/good loot.
3. One where you have to run across half the map, to the strangest locations, through several hotspots. Let alone, use a key card that costs a shit ton of money. There's no reason to use this extract over the original ones. (And please, remove those alarms...)

&amp;#x200B;

If everything ran perfectly in Tarkov, and there were no Skills issues, etc., a weight system would be welcomed. It could work. But right now, they've totally jumped the gun for such a mechanism.

Lastly: The community seems very split on this subject. I understand if some people enjoy it - that's fine for them, but for the rest of us, it's a shit situation to be in. I seriously hope the devs remove this function until a later stage, when the rest of the game works as intended.",152,1585685155,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fsk684/latest_patch_have_made_me_stop_playing_tarkov/,EscapefromTarkov,8

fsjfmz,Fishboy212,PvP is in an odd spot at the moment,"The current Meta has made the game a lot less fun to play currently. On most maps ,90% of the time, the only enemy me or my squad sees are hatchlings running around with mosins or pistols. This makes raids way less fun to bring gear in. You have to risk it all for nearly no loot in return. To combat this i have a few ideas:

1. put a “ pay wall “ over certain maps. for example; have a 250k minimum character value to enter the map. this might help the hatchling invasion.

2. Make a new game mode where the max players is higher and it does not spawn player scavs. Take customs, which can have 7 to 12 PMC’s. I say it should be raised to maybe like 10 to 15, and the player scav spawn reduced 

I’m just tired of killing hatchlings and i want some chads to come into my raids and higher player counts with increase those odds.

fshf84,FightMeIRLScrub,Flashlights are kinda useless against NVGs in CQC,"*TL;DR Even the brightest flashlight in the game (2U ""Kleh"") is barely useful for blinding PMCs with NVGs outside of CQC. At best, they blind NVG users and allow you see in dark spots. At worst, they hinder the user's ability to see whilst simultaneously aiding their enemy's.*

I've made an album showcasing flashlights vs NVGs &amp; non-NVGs in Factory. The findings are interesting to say the least. Unless flashlights being used by players behave differently than flashlights dropped on the floor, I'd consider most of what I found to be valid.

fshcwp,AdamsS123,"Horrible Hacker Infestation in LABS !!! 50% or more raids have a hacker, please do something!!! Best map ever RUINED!","I play the game for 3 years and I can tell who is cheating and who is not.

It doesn't matter because Labs cheaters cheat balantly and even your grandma could tell some1 has aimbot or esp.

Today I ran labs for a few hours (EU) and literally every 2nd raid or 2 raids in a row had cheaters in them! I can tell because I play labs since it was released and I never call out unknown deaths. On labs because its CQC u can see clearly some1 sliding around the map or prefireing a corner ur about to peak from 100m away.

Labs is such a great PVP map that it deserves to be saved, for the OG chads that finally want some end game PVP, not only fighting low geared players on open maps...

&amp;#x200B;

I know that single posts won't do anything but if we keep bringing up the issue, it might get fixed faster, if ever....

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine some big streamers like Dr. Disrespect, Summit, Shroud, Pestily, etc. playing labs 24/7 raid after raid - only then the majority of the audience which doesn't run labs would see the problem with their own eyes and would believe that it is actually horribly bad. 

I have never seen so many cheaters in any other game just in 1 place, and in Tarkov it hurts 10x more than in CoD or BF, because of the time and effort to get into each raid.

Labs IMO is the best and most fun PVP map out there and it needs to be saved, because after the exploration period is over for new players, only the awesome PVP will keep them playing the game on the awesome map which is Labs. 

With steam audio it will become even better with flanks that arent heard from a 100m through concrete, but cheating on that map is a huge issue.",4,1585676359,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fshcwp/horrible_hacker_infestation_in_labs_50_or_more/,EscapefromTarkov,0

fshai9,Sunkysanic,To the guy who dropped me on Customs yesterday,"No, I don’t know what I was thinking, and yes, I am very ashamed.

I got home from work at a decent time. Excited to get a few good raids in on a weeknight, i fire up the BSG launcher. My pmc is ready, trusty SKS in hand, garnished by level 4 ceramic armor. I’m feeling great. The evening is mine.

I load into customs for a warm up raid. Just ahead of the train, opposite side from big red. I know the spawns. Someone one will be coming. I make a move, just a few hundred feet towards dorms when a crack rips through my headphones, landing an m61 round at my feet. I sprint, hard left into the woods, taking cover against the broken fence. I know you’re coming for me. And sure enough, almost immediately footsteps ring out through my Sordins. Right side. Wait, maybe left...yes. I’ve got you. It’s over. Three BP rounds later, your body rattles to the ground, naked save for a hunter rifle with a mag of m61 rounds. You could have shredded me. One shot would have likely done it. But, never-the-less, I prevailed. I equip the rifle, mostly out of spite. “You’re not getting this one back,” I think to myself in a fleeting, smug little moment.

And here’s where it all goes awry. As I leave your corpse to rest, ready to search for a new victim, in a momentary lapse of judgement I....*tea bag it*. As if I were playing high school friends in Halo after a long day. Or, worse yet, *Call of Duty* for Christ’s sake. 

By the time I heard it, it was too late. A ripping sound...my heart falls out of my chest as the bullets ripped through my armor. It only took 2 shots to paint my monitor with a black screen of death all the while searing such embarrassment forever into my brain.

fsgijr,SloppyGoose,A cheaters perspective on Tarkov,"Please read fully before posting a comment about what a horrible person I am. and mods, Im not condoning cheating, quite the opposite, so please don't remove this post at first glance.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, Ill start off with a small explanation, I cheat in almost every game I play, I usually have a side account for said doings and play legit on my main account and such, but cheating has always been a interest of mine, maybe its the coding behind it or the techniques or maybe I'm just a bad person, from Siege to GTA I cheat, from mod menus to aimbot I enjoy indulging myself in the community and act of cheating.

Here's where Tarkov comes in, about 2\~ months ago my small discord of friends brought up Tarkov, a few have been playing since the very early days, some just picked it up a week ago, I bought the game and played it a bit with my friends, pretty interesting experience quite a fun game, so of course, I started cheating, I purchased an alt and decided to not buy cheats and just throw together some very basic scripts for myself using some old modified sources and some free stuff around the cheater community.

I got on the next day without my friends and put myself into a few offline raids tweaking my cheats and using scavs for target practice and felt I could do some damage online, queued into customs and blew away a few low gear players who had zero chance, ran into some beefy gear boys who put up a good fight but getting shot through bushes by some neck beard with god armor is an unwinnable fight.

Extracted with gear I had never even seen before or knew how to use properly. 

I did this a few times over the course of a week in between work and such, taking in the best gear I got and doing it over, on about my 15th raid I ran across a 5 man of new players, I gunned them down without a second thought but this felt different to killing geared guys in dorms or obliterating a 5 man of experienced players, It felt like I just ruined somebodies day, seeing their loot that was obviously from scavs, SKSs, Mosins, AKs without stocks and damaged armor I sat there for a few minutes, I decided to spend the rest of the raid picking up all their gear and stringing it out in a few bushes around the area hoping they insured at least some of it.

 I didn't extract because of the time limit but I didn't care much, once I got to the end screen I just sat there thinking, the low gear players I killed could have been young teenagers that just bought the game with their group of friends and playing it after school, or just a group of friends enjoying a brand new game to them and they get unfairly killed by me. my thought process eventually devolved into all the gear people lost to me, geared and ungeared alike, how its such a different experience getting a kill in Tarkov than anywhere else, you earn your gear and what you carry on your back, each piece of gear you have carries a story with it, whether you got it from a box in some dusty room or took it off a dead PMC after patching the holes he put in you with it in a gunfight. Its a different feeling than any other game.

In Siege if I kill somebody with cheats they get mad and forget about it later that day, I never cheated in any ranked or serious environment where MMR or Rank mattered, in Tarkov death always has a lasting effect on somebody even if they dont recognize it.

After sitting there for a bit I turned off my cheats and went into a raid, I dont even really remember why.

I went into interchange and I was geared to the teeth, I ran into the mall, mowed down a few scavs and ran into Killa, after getting the drop on him and killing him I snagged his gear and moved out of the mall, moving down the rear ramp of the mall I got shot in the back, ran to cover and saw a 4 person group of player scavs, after a very intense battle they out maneuvered me and got the kill, even tho I died and lost some of the best gear in the game including Killas gear I was laughing. the entire battle I was giggling seeing these scavs using their skill to compensate for what little they had in gear to take down basically a Boss to them, and imagining the reactions of them when the final Mosin bullet punches right through my face mask, how happy they would be sharing all of my gear hoping they got out with all of it.

I got back to the main screen and quit the game, maneuvered to Tarkovs website and reset my account, deleted my cheats and even bought Edge of Darkness, got on with my friends later in that day and since then I've been having a fucking blast with this game, getting blasted from observatory, getting mowed down by a thermal in woods or killing a Scav boss I've been enjoying it, you people in this community have something really special, I've been in this Reddit for a bit now and I enjoy the community so much.

If Tarkov can push me to turn off my cheats without threatening a ban and I even enjoy myself in the game play more than I did while cheating, thats a testament to just how god damn good this game is, and it makes me sick to my stomach how people can cheat in such a great and unique game knowing they are leaving a lasting effect and mark on people by actually ruining their progress and hard work, they are the true scum of the cheating community and thats impressive to get to that point.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoyed my story on this game and degenerate beginnings.

This post isn't trying to get people to cheat in anyway, I specifically left any details about my cheats or methods out of this post I will not answer any messages or anything similar of anybody asking for cheats or source code.

I don't know the beginnings of how to combat hacking and anything I could suggest would be pure conjecture on my part. However, I am a consumer and as such am growing increasingly frustrated that cheaters are spilling out of labs into more levels. I've been killed by people 100% cheating on factory night raids three times this week and it's only Tuesday.

EFT is already incredibly unforgiving and dying because some neck beard has power issues makes me want to punt my monitor into space.

Let's let them kill each other and enjoy the wonders of a full sprint face tap.

fsfo1i,snek_of_tarkov,BSG: 'We have discarded the game is for fun doctrine' / 'The game […] is not intended for casual gamers […]' / 'We'll stay true to our concept of hardcore realism in everything.' --- We should have a hard discussion about realism.,"

==============
We should have a hard discussion about realism.
==============


First, let me say that anyone who comes in with the argument: 'The game cannot be fully realistic because it is not uninstalling after pmc death...' should remove himself from the topic right now, because he has the reasoning capacity of a hamster. 


Take a look at this image of various quotes from BSG interviews:
(some are google translated from other languages)


==============
Image compilation of interview quotes
==============

Images: https://imgur.com/a/ZDNNkNT 



&gt; Mein-MMO:  Aren't you worried that strong realism could make the game too difficult for casual gamers to shy away from?

&gt; Battlestate Games:  In the first place, the game is basically not intended for casual gamers. And we try to convey this from the first impression. The success and effectiveness of the combat system will depend heavily on the knowledge of the game and the understanding of modern combat.



==============
Remove ammo + gun + armor balance
==============

&gt;  All the weapons are absolutely real and have truly lifelike physical properties

* Look at fully-automatic fire, and compare that to real life. The recoil is so hard, a 15 year old boy can handle it better in real life than our trained PMC.

Fully automatic fire ingame vs real life:

https://imgur.com/a/GZz4ndE 

Teenage boy shooting glock18c: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF4Jda7kXKI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=182 



Some might make the argument that then everyone would hipfire in close combat. So what? That is realistic, and it is balanced by:

* ammo cost
* weapon availability that can do full auto fire
* target using cover


Oops all of these three don't matter anymore:

* Ammo is available for cheap (1200 roubles per M995 is 5 times cheaper than it should be). 
* Weapons are all available for less than 50k with some exceptions. 
* And using cover, that was deleted by fast strafe speed.

What would fix all of that?
 
* Make ammo find only, let players suffer and fight hard to survive with trash guns and trash ammo.

* Make weapons nearly kill or at least make shooting back with accuracy impossible (not just for half a second of screen bounce), if a player takes a regular SKS round in the arm, no matter what type of round, he should not be able to do accurate fire beyond 20 meters. That would put focus on players avoiding hits in the first place. A player taking a hit into unprotected areas from any caliber should take out a large chunk of his combat capability for this raid.


Most of that was like this early in Tarkov's development. Hit to a black limb would kill a player. Then it was nerfed to damage being distributed with a multiplier of 2x to other limbs, until that multiplier was removed. Now a player can walk around with FIVE .308 M80 hits and still fight and run around with 40 hp left.

Why? Because idiots using armor as a healthpool to tank damage complained about 'leg meta' which in reality means enemies shooting the exposed parts. That type of stupidity should force them into re-evaluating tactics. However players who don't use cover managed to get BSG to design the game around their tactical failures. BSG is virtually rewarding players for playing bad, instead of rewarding players for using realistic tactics. 

This is an inversion of the original promise:

&gt; Battlestate Games:  In the first place, the game is basically not intended for casual gamers. And we try to convey this from the first impression. The success and effectiveness of the combat system will depend heavily on the knowledge of the game and the understanding of modern combat.








==============
'If the game is too hard no one will play it!'
==============

That is just not true. Players will keep playing more the harder a game is.

* Players play PUBG is because it is so hard there is a base chance of 1% to win the round. PUBG punishes bad luck and bad tactics right away, and only those who play the hardest might get into the top 10 survivors of the raid, and only the absolute best win the match.

* Players CSGO, because in competitive mode, it is so hard, most players barely manage to hold on to a 50% win rate. Every rank-up is hard-fought. 

* Players play DAYZ because of the constant danger of losing your progress at any moment, and that fear grows with the age of a character.

Players want:

* hard

* unforgiving

* stressful

I think BSG wants 'too hard' too. As you can see in one of the quotes. Their own words:

&gt; Battlestate Games:  In the first place, the game is basically not intended for casual gamers. And we try to convey this from the first impression. The success and effectiveness of the combat system will depend heavily on the knowledge of the game and the understanding of modern combat.



BSG borked that part by replacing hard with the rush of picking up items from the ground, which created a runaway diablo gameplay addiction for casual players, who downvote everything that gets in the way of the 'fun' of picking up stuff. Then it's a closed feedback loop that reinforces more and more loot collecting.

There is a hideout where players FARM bitcoins. This is a perverse inversion of the hardcore realism proposition. Players farm fetch quests to spawn gold coins in their stash. And they only come out when the gear is exactly what they want. This thing went off the rails.


==============
What dis?
==============

This list of interview quotes was compiled so the newer players can understand why some of the older tarkov players are so angry with the game at times. It was intended as an ultra realistic combat simulator, not a loot farm.




BSG likely has their goal to get as many people as possible to play, so the game gets into the billion (that is million x1000) revenue category, like PUBG. 

I get that BSG won't jump off that money train and reverse the game to its original promise. At the least they should offer a second game mode that throws out balance, and models everything to realism. (That's going to be the mode everyone will play anyway after the reddit whining will stop, but that is for another time). 

The player amounts are large enough for that.

* Tarkov has likely 50-120k concurrent players.

* If they would have sold 1 million copies, that would be 40-60 million € revenue in total. Then if we assume of these, a third is EOD, which is 2-3x the price, then we can assume 150 million € in revenue. And they have up to 100 developers. They are swimming in cash.

Not a small team, not a small amount of players.

==========
BSG made their success with hard work, however there should to be room for hard realism.
==========


BSG did great work with making this game, however there should be room for the original promise, in form of a separate gamemode.

It would be simple, just replicate reality for that separate mode, every ammo type and armor, 1:1 to reality. Let helmets be useless, because their job in combat is to protect from shrapnel, concussion and perhaps some grazed rounds. 

Just give the realism players their own niche to play in. 


==========
There are no chads
==========

One more thing I would like to write about. Players like to classify groups into 'chads' and 'rats'. However to me, chads are just hamsters.

Rats are amazing, they are resilient animals that go out and get done what they need to do, under the worst circumstance. Hamsters only go out in absolute safety and stuff their pouches.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now the quest doesn't have any place in the game, lore wise or gameplay wise. No one in their right minds would go against full auto guys with bolt action rifle, especially at point blank range. Another issue is that this quest (or cold blooded) \*requires\* players to cheese it in factory; hence it is bad quest design.

And it (the suggestion) also still fits the description. Quest will still be hard, tedious &lt;like it is now&gt; but atleast possible to do it without cheesing, blind luck and twitch reflexes no everyone has. And even more fun this way, having to sneak up on scavs ON ANY MAP PLAYER LIKES instead of waiting for RNG uber luck to find someone camping in the woods/shoreline/anywhere else...being able to sneak up on their headset backs....while having mosin yourself. It is too time consuming to be able to finish this quest naturally.

Right now it seems this quest, among many other jaeger's quests are total anti-fun, time and money sinks and alienate players with the game and quest system as a whole. Quests should not feel like rare achievements.

And it is insane how you can easilly have all the other traders at lvl 4 when jaeger will be stuck at lvl 1 or lvl 2.

edit:  while speaking of achievements BSG can put insane hard tasks as an achievement badges so if there is ever possibility of checking out other players profiles those who want can flex their achievement badges if they wish.

So we all know, well most of us and I'm not sure how big of a problem it is but EFT has hackers could be many, could be few. I am sure most of it can be down desync, server issues, lag but no doubt some of the videos are super sketchy. I also love watching some of the big players and how amazing they are, the accuracy and style they play but today that came a little into question for me....

Yesterday I saw a video were someone was potentially exposed as using a radar during the game, then today I see a popular EFT player named summit1g do a video and acting dumbfounded that such a thing existed. Like what even is this, how would it work etc, which to me seemed a little like you play this game A LOT you only seem to play EFT  your videos are very much hey look at how awesome I am meme filled things, I have only played EFT a month and know about the radar. So you definitely must know it

So I was watching a Pestily video and some of the kills, like one he walked into a house and without blinking took a player out who was lying perfectly still, around a corner on the floor tucked right back and not making a noise. I then watched his eyes as he plays and more often than not he's not massively watching his screen when going around etc. 

So, I hit google just do a search within a second a site selling radar pops up, all you need is a 2nd PC and some $

fscvvf,R2ppey,One Year off the Game,"Hey Guys,

&amp;#x200B;

My buddy and I started playing EFT in December 2017. We were hooked and everything was going great. Then came along some patches, more maps and more quests along with the devs making the game a lot more hardcore and more grindy. Seeing that both of us work full time and maybe even more, we could not keep up with how much the game needed grinding so we took a break for a while. Then came Labs. We had so much fun in that map, we were hooked once again. Once they locked Labs behind the key card access, we were back to that same old grinding along with having to do the same quests that we've already done like 5-6 times in the past so we took another, but much longer break. We've been missing the game but every time we think about getting back into it we remember all the things I mentioned above. So my questions to you are: How is the game playing now? Is it still very demanding and grindy? How often are they doing wipes? Is the game running a little better now? Seeing my situation, would you advise me to get back  to the game?

fscq22,Analpractices,"Discussion about the rampant and undectable radar cheat, and what BSG can do to stop it.","So because packets are not encrypted the cheaters have managed to create software that analyzes traffic that is incoming.


THese cheaters play the game like the rest of us, they do not have any aimbot/speedhack/ traditional wallhack.



What they do have is a VM or a second PC running with a radar. Basically a map where all player entities plus themselves are marked on it. Plus any items they mark on the map are displayed. Even those in containers.



Basically all loot and items everywhere is predetermined once the raid starts and all that data is already sent to the client. Also all positional data from all living things, Scavs, Pmc's, player scavs, bosses etc is sent aswell continuously.



Solutions in order of effectiveness against this particular cheat:


1. Encrypt all data between client and server, preferably with changing encryptions ever so often. The cheat industry is huge, and the developers you are up against are no idiots, infact some of these sites make literally millions a year and they have a staff that in coding skills is equilevant to that budget.Know what you are up against. Keep 1 encryption standard for too long ~2 weeks and they will figure you out.

2. Ban all sorts of VM. VM ware and some more common VM's are currently unable to run, battleeye won't let you access the game with it running. This started a few months ago in response to this radar. However they haven't been able to ban all VM. Some Linux based VM's that you seperately run from a USB are wholly undetectable by windows at the current moment, and thus aswell by battleeye.


3. Ban all use of connecting through a VPN. How this cheat works is this. Gaming PC connects through a VPN to the VM/second workstation. The VM/Second workstation only job is to route it's traffic back to the gaming PC, however on the second pc/VM they've set up packet analysis software that gives you an unfair advantage.



I've gone through alot of cheating discords and founds literally thousands of paid subscribers to this service. With a few google searches.  With most of their names in Discord casually displaying: Playing Escape From Tarkov.



If BSG or BattleEye needs any help, i've managed to get my hands on the source code. Infact it's openly shared on cheatdevelopers forums.



Now this has been gonig on for over 2 months now and nothing is been done about it. With a few simple clicks you can find thousands of discord users as paid members to a service and then I haven't even tried looking at the dozens of vendors. I found thousands of users when I looked at 2. I'm quite sure I could find upwards of ten thousand active users if I checked more cheating vendors discord.


Frankly, Im almost at the point of compiling this source code and putting it on github as a simple .exe installation file for anyone to use free of charge. Now I won't, atleast not yet because I love  Tarkov and I do not want to blackmail the devs into sorting it out.


But as Overwatch has shown, Cheats like these that are relatively benign. No aimbot, no speedhack, no real wallhack. Rather it's just an informational advantage which in tarkov is huge. But Overwatch has shown that they let ""simple"" cheats like these go undetected until someone that was sick of it released the source code for everyone to use, so that forced Blizzard into sorting it out.



Now it's only tens of thousands of users using this service, loads of people in your raids have unfair advantages. They know where the good loot is when the map starts. They know where everyone else is so they can set up easy ambushes or stay away if they want to.


Frankly, this has to get fixed quite fast. Not only are some people making millions a year of exploiting your game's regular users who just try to have a fun few hours. But seeing how widespread it already is and so far nothing has been done about it. It's literally grew exponentially these last few months.

I was sitting and thinking about other games like CS and it's prime matchmaking and all of that, and came to this idea that would benefit the devs as it would push players to play through the game's tasks and fully experience Tarkov (the way I assume they intend players to experience it).

Lock labs behind tasks. I understand not everyone has time for tasks, but if it's locked behind 20-30 tasks, it would make it much harder for cheaters to just jump into labs and zoom around making millions of roubles a raid to sell for real world money.

Link to part 1: [Documenting the guide. part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frnitp/documenting_the_guide_part_1/)

Hello again. This is a story about my attempts of doing the 'guide; quest from peacekeeper. This was my second day of trying it. I hope you enjoy the story, and if you have any question on it. Feel free to ask! TLDR at the bottom again. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fourth Try:**

\- Factory: As usual im starting on factory again. I spawned near the factory door again. Before i headed out I waited a bit untill i heared some shots coming from the offices. I tried to find a scav on my side of factory but failed to do so. I sprinted through the lower area of factory towards the gate 1 extract. Still no scavs around however. I went down in the tunnels again and eventually heared a scav or pmc walking above me. I sneaked towards the corner he was coming towards and had a small firefight with him which i won. A scav player. I looted his armor and gun and extracted at gate 1. I discovered after the game that my peepee helmet (tm) actually saved me with a riocochet. Best helmet ever!

\- Customs: Back at customs. This time i spawned at the trailer park and made my way over the right land bridge towards the other side of the water. Luckily 3 scavs spawned near the RUAF roadblock extract which were easy to kill. I looted one of the bodies and quickly made my way around the construction area towards the bus station. I crossed the bus station and kept to the side of the hills all the way to the other side of the map. All the way at the military base scav extract i ran in a low geared pmc which was the first time i won a fight against a pmc in this quest and lived to tell the tale. I quickly took his weapon with me and safely extracted at ZB-1011 soon after.

\- Woods: Since my last death was at woods i decided to do it earlier this time. I spawned at the UN roadblock extract. A great place to start because i can quickly extract from the cliff descent. I safely made my way there and tried to find a scav in the area. No luck however. I went and see if i could kill the sniper scav and make him fall so i could loot him for the experience requirement. He was there and astounishing enough he fell off. I walked towards him and immidiatly saw a geared pmc aiming at me from next to the mountain sides. A small firefight later i manage to kill him with what seemed to be a headshot. I cripple may way to some bushes because three of my limbs where blacked out and i was bleeding heavily. One part of me wanted to cripple too the extract and leave. But the rat took the upperhand so i looted the body of the pmc. Well hot damn! two highly modded weapons and lvl 6 armor. A really nice m4, and a DVL with a REAP-ir thermal. I quickly scooped up his loot and safely extracted at the cliff descent.

\- Interchange: Interchange. Another map i died on. Maybe i was lucky this time. I spawned outside of IDEA and the idea was to quickly run in the garage again and try to find a scav there. However as soon as i walked up the hill with the tower. bullets started flying my way. In blind panick i tried to flee in the garage but i was no use. The bullets kept hitting me and only 30 seconds in the raid my lifeless body hit the floor... Quest failed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fifth Try:**

\- Factory: Well here we are again. I spawned in the tunnels in the middle of the map. Not quite sure what to do so i decided to slowly go towards the gate 1 extract again. I hear gunshots all around and scav are shouting up above. To risky however to go up now. PMC's are around so i make my way towards the barrel spawn. However no scavs on that side. I turn around and start walking back when i suddenly hear a scav shout in the area i just looked at. A scav spawned at the rafters! He walks down the iron stairs and i quickly kill him when he is at the bottom. I scoop up his shotgun and safely extract from gate 1.

\- Interchange: With the bad luck i had so far on this map i decided to do it immidiatly after factory this time. I spawn at the same area as before and this time safely make my way in the garage. Luckily enough there is one scav walking around here which i could kill for the experience requirements. I take his stuff with me and make my way towards the hole in the wall extract. However near the hole leading up towards kiba store i see a three man squad running towards me. DID THEY SEE ME? I hide behind a van, not daring to peek. A minute goes past with no sounds. I peek the corner and see no one around. Did they go away? is it safe? I wait for 30 more seconds before i slowly make my way to the well lighted hole in the wall. No one around. I sprint through the hole and make it safely to my extract. Interchange done!

\- Customs: This time i spawn next to the bridge. A good spot to start. I immidiatly sprint over the bridge towards the construction zone. Sadly no scavs around and no vision on the sniper scav. I go out of the hole and walk along the road towards the bus station. Suddenly there are footsteps to my right. I sneak in some cover and to my luck see a scav on the road. I dome him and quickly loot his stuff. I immidiatly sprint to the bus station and halt there to listen for some sounds. I hear footsteps again outside of the green walls. I peak the corner and see a low geared pmc walking towards me. I fire some shots at him and hit him a couple of times in his thorax and arm. He bolts away an i hear him lay down to heal. No need to go for the kill. I bolt away towards the factory key shortcut. A sniper shot hits me in the back but luckily my armor saves me from most of the damage. I keep sprinting and go through the already opened shortcut towards the old gas station. At old gas station i see someone sitting behind a fan and one tap him in the head. No need to loot (Apparently was a pmc, but because he was wearing a ushanka i tought it was a scav at the time). I keep running and safely extract from ZB-1010

\- Woods: I load in and see that this time i spawned at the worse spawn possible. All the way in the corner next to the scav house. This means i have to get all the way to the other side dodging all the pmc's... I slowly make my way along the side towards the lumber mill. I started my way over the beach and suddenly hear steps to my left. A scav! And a easy kill as well. Only one shot and i scoop up his loot. The experience requirements are met! I sprint allong th beach and make why may to the bloodied van near the water. I see a group of three scavs pass me to the left. No need to alert them. However another scav is in front of me which i kill. No time to loot. I quickly run all the way along the water and see to my luck the extract nearby is open. No one around so i safely extract from woods.

\- Reserve: only three more maps to go now. This time i spawn near the heating pipe. I made my way in the underground garage from there in hopes of finding a scav somewhere down there. No luck again. I go out and make my way towards the manhole cover in hope a scav spawned somewhere over there. Nothing. With no clue what to do now I wait for a bit. From inside the house next to the manhole cover i see a scav on the other side of the area. I run towards the small building with a pc in it and lcukily the scav comes closer. I shoot him quickly and loot his belongings. Shot nearby however so no time to wait. I run back towards the manhole cover and skitter through the sewers into safety.

\- Labs: The end is nearby. Not gonna take any chance so i slap on my lvl 6 killa armor and lvl 6 vulcan helmet with a faceshield. I spawn near the kitchen on the top floor. First priority is getting to the bottom floor safely. I make my way towards the stairs leading down when i get shot in the back by a pmc from above. Luckily my lvl 6 armor does his job and saves me from dieing on the spot. I sprint down in the bowels of labs and heal up. Luckily no one came after me. No to find a raider. I walk around in hopes to find one at the ventilation extract. Nothing however. Time to start looting, i loot every toolbox and weapon box i can find and try to quickly calculate how much exp i get. Around 150? maybe 200? i keep looting untill im quite sure that im above 300 exp. Gonna take the chance. I extract from the ventilation shaft and the screen goes black. No sounds. i cross my fingers... did i have enough exp???  The screen shows and it is a succesfull extract! 350 exp from looting and 100 exp from healing and drinking. ONE MORE MAP TO GO!

\- Shoreline: Again no chances! Lvl 6 armor and helmet and a fully kitted m4a1 with the thermal i got in my fourth try.  I spawn near road to customs and slowly make my way towards rock passage. I scout everywhere with my thermal to see if no one is around. Around the broken house on the hill area i suddenly see a white dot on my thermal next to the wall im traveling along. This can only mean another pmc. I hold my breath i go for the shots. 1 shot.. 2 shot and he drops.. Did he lay down or is he dead? I slowly make my way towards him and as i get closer i see that his body i laying on his back. Which means a kill. WHICH MEANS I HAVE ENOUGH EXP FOR AN EXTRACT! i take his dogtag and make my way to rock passage constantly scanning my surroundings. god i hope the extract is open. At the top of the hill i look down and see no smoke.. I get a little bit closer and YES! THE GREEN SMOKE OF SALVATION! I walk in the extract and the timer starts. 6 seconds... 5 seconds.. 4 seconds.. way does THIS TAKE SO LONG!!! 3 seconds.... 2 seconds.... 1 second.... the screen goes back. I survived. i did it! I head towards peacekeeper to make sure and see that i did not activate the quest however.....

fsbevo,calibanate,SUGGESTION: What if Night Time Maps Meant Higher Tier Loot?,"Currently night time is something that's rarely played and it's either fully geared maxed-out NVG players or hatchlings trying to avoid contact.

But what if night time became something more than that? What if night time became the 'hardcore' mode for each map - more loot, higher tier items, raiders and bosses guaranteed and also equipped with high tier armor and weapons.

Then some challenging quests could have a requirement that they have to be done at night time. The night time could be like a 'lockdown' where to access it you need to have done some quest(s) for a trader to allow you to enter these zones during lockdown, or you could buy a 'passport' or pay a certain amount or rubels to enter.

I feel like this would add a lot to Tarkov's endgame and add a lot for players who have completed all the quests and are level 40+ - they could face off against very tough AI and similarly geared opponents.",14,1585654770,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fsbevo/suggestion_what_if_night_time_maps_meant_higher/,EscapefromTarkov,1
fsbe3b,canadianraptour,Aiming heavier guns for a long time should slowly increase strength,"Strength right now is one of the hardest skills to get (cheese or non cheese ) and I personally think there needs to be something changed. Much like the other skills in game that the player does on a basic raid like running, healing and sneaking around those naturally level as we do but strength gets stuck so one way to add it as a slow but natural way of leveling strength should be aiming down heavier set weapons like sniper rifles or metal aks and such I don’t think people should able to have a pistol and level strength from nothing , but if players are holding a mosin on keep their sights up long enough it should slowly level up along with you",10,1585654667,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fsbe3b/aiming_heavier_guns_for_a_long_time_should_slowly/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fsaqrg,Aplusho1996,Just soloed everyone in a Factory Night raid (REALISTIC DIAGRAM INCLUDED!),"Today I decided to do a bit of Nighttime Factory Raid on my own to practice my skills with a pair of Night vision googles, as well as hoping to do the 10 PMC kills in Office. I waited for about 3-4 minutes on ""Waiting for players"" and was expecting a dead raid, then I spawned right outside of Gate 3 around the pipes.   


The moment I spawned in I was ready to sprint up to 3F. That's when I heard about a million footsteps behind me from Glass hallway.   


I spun around quickly, but one of the steps had already reached the metal catwalk over the large giant oil canisters.   


Out of options, I decided to run towards the 1F office door. Suddenly, another set of steps started approaching from that side. With nowhere to run, I snuck straight into the large metal container on my left and stayed still, even though I was sure they had already heard me.   


Just when I am thinking about what to do, I heard ANOTHER set of steps coming from the metal catwalk near suicide (2F office door leading to the metal catwalk with a small shack), and NONE of them are shooting at each other at all. That's when I know I was thoroughly fucked. Not only that, all the steps slowed down to a halt OUTSIDE my container. So here's a little diagram to show you what I was up against:

[10\/10 diagram](https://preview.redd.it/6uubrjo1kzp41.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c10cc9f0d217eac078efade16efabd560f916eb)

I was ready to meet my maker as I knew I was trapped. I had no way out, one grenade would be the end of me. That's when I saw a CONE of FLASHLIGHT just flashed right by my eyes. That PMC (Number 1) was UNDERGEARED as all hell. He didn't even have a Night vision on (Im running the cheap PVT). He must be the weaker link of the team, as he just sprinted straight for Gate 3 with a PISTOL (flashlight attached) (Possibly hoping for a Extract Camp?), completely oblivious to the fact that I was sitting right behind him. I took the chance and planted a few solid shots into his torso and he fell face flat on the ground.  


If they didn't notice I was there before, now they definitely know. The second PMC (No.2) swooped in quickly with an MP-133 and planted a solid shot into my right arm, blacking it immediately. I fired back and managed to take him out, but I was injured and panting like crazy.   


The third guy must be on comms with them, as he knew I was hurt and wasted no time. He came swooping in with a Saiga-9 from the right. I did the quickest flick of my life, my wrist must have had a G-force of 9 or something, as I popped his thorax right off.   


It was only me and that prick left. I could hear him stalling as he slowly edged his way towards me on the catwalk outside suicide. I slowly peeked out from the left of the container, trying to figure out where he was. He fired immediately and hit me with an SVD, blacking my leg as well. At this point I had about 160hp left and was bleeding out, my leg and arm was blacked. There was no cover in the container. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's when my big brain hit. I pulled out my IFAK and I FEIGNED a heal. As soon as I UNZIPPED that IFAK, I cancelled it immediately and pulled my SKS back out. 

&amp;#x200B;

He must have taken the bait, as I could hear him stomping his way down and even JUMPED off the stairs, landing square in my face. He fired frantically as I tapped him square on the face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Silence ensured. I could hear the blood pumping through my veins. I grabbed whatever I could and got the hell out of there. 

&amp;#x200B;

10/10 would do it again.

However it got me thinking yeah keys are great but I think it would be cool if you could buy breaching, shaped charges and still saws etc if you don't want to use a key or don't have one.  Make it a proper breach instead of just kicking.  Maybe even a breaching shotgun for wooden doors. 

Obviously the offset would be a timer, distance, noise. Also you could have random effects like sometimes the door may come off, sometimes may need a second go, may just create half a entrance or say you have to leave backpack to get in, also say a saw or blow touch would create a lot of light and noise.

Has this ever been talked about? Discussed? Just imagine storming dorms with a squad, exploding doors, flash bangs etc. Entering at the end and seeing the carnage after with svavs, players, doors blown off.  Also would make more specialised squad members that you could have a demo set up.

fs9hok,tellwilk,Getting Good,"All it takes to get is time. I recently started playing and stopped playing a week in it was brutal but once I noticed how I was played and how I needed to play it all changed. I YouTube and twitch are good sources but what they rarely tell you is how to find your mojo so to say. You got to take the time to get over the fact you will lose stuff either by selling and trading or simply just dying. I don’t stress money for two reasons I’m still newish to the game and don’t know what’s what and where it is,so to say. Second this is the beta there will be wipes until the game is done. So acceptance of loss is a big key to the beta and will be pivotal for the finished product. 

Getting good I think is about playing at you own pace and having fun. I’ve been doing no armor runs mostly to troll pmc into wasting ammo on me as fill my gama first and insure questling gear. I generally am passive to pmcs right now as I am questing solo and not really good at pvp so passive i. The other reason is to keep me alert and aware of scavs and to practice my aim for xp and movements. While pmc and player scavs run around to loots spots the paths traveled are semi predictable and I tend to avoid theses paths meaning the scavs are static to a certain degree and predictable once you understand there programming.

Getting good should be top priority for people who want to enjoy the game. Getting good is a grind but when the gameplay is genuinely great look at everything in game as time well spent, survive or die. The emotional coaster is fun as hell. Looking back at any memory I have of raids situations and experience in them there is always a take away. the game is probably the best unpopular game in terms of triple A games. 


The take away from this should be is, it takes time to get good. Don’t rush yourself have fun. If you’re reading this thanks  for letting me get this of my chest. I am enjoying the game now and can’t wait to get better/ die a lot more. Take care",0,1585644701,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs9hok/getting_good/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fs9h84,rare47_jackje,It's kinda sad,"I started playing Tarkov at the beginning of 2017. I had a blast playing the game (didn't play every wipe, but I still got about 3k hours in this game). I could not wait to get home after work and getting on with my squad. Of course there were some days where the servers were funky, it was laggy and so on, which were straining my nerves. It still kept me playing.

&amp;#x200B;

In the last 3 or 4 weeks, I can mostly motivate myself to play 1 or 2 rounds on 3 or 4 evenings per week. So... what changed? I think I got to mention that I was pretty fond of the looting aspect of the game. The latest introduction of the weight system hit me hard. In the beginning, I thought: ""well, that's just a new way to play I guess. Just have to get used to the new playing style as we did in the other big patches in the past."" So I gamed on, but couldn't quite get back in, as I did previously.

&amp;#x200B;

So what changed? It's the rewarding feeling I got from PvP and looting afterwards (90% PvP Player btw). Why waste expensive bullets and my gear to kill someone, to leave nearly all his loot because of the weight?

Why playing with my favourite guns/gear when those nearly push me over the weight limit and I'm already a sloth at the start of the raid? Others might say: ""Well, just level your skills and everything will be fine"". Yeah... as a normal working casual Player that plays on evenings it takes ages.

""Well, then don't play the game you filthy casual, it's only for the hardcore players. Its never meant to be a game for the plebs.""

&amp;#x200B;

I guess ill have to accept that I am not the audience this game is aimed at. I guess I've just to find something else. It's the first game I've encountered that managed to take away my fun and interest with one patch. From: ""I can't wait to get online"" to ""I guess I'll play one or two rounds because I've got nothing else to play"". Maybe I'm the only one that feels like this.

So of course I get a nice 6B47 with the 200k night vision and go to work with an AK. First thing that happens is I sprint to offices, then get up top in the cat-walk thing kind of above Gate 3 Extract. Luckily, I spot 3 juicy Chads sprinting to gate 3. Of course they are planning to extract camp, this is literally in the first minute of the raid. I one tap one in the head while two of them sprint into the door, and I decide to sit and wait. Again, very luckily, one of the Chads decide to try to close the door behind them. I literally shot one bullet and killed him as the door was closing. 

Oh shit! There's someone coming up behind me in the offices! I take my AK and hard peek the angle and completely dumpster ANOTHER chad!

fs7te4,xanorthz,"""Western Rounds"" and drop sources","Currently the game predominantly only drops Russian rounds, which makes sense as the fictional zone of Tarkov is in Russia. 

However Lore wise, Shoreline and Terralab groups, are Western controlled, and in trailers we see USEC's dominantly using M4's, and when we go to create our Character, we pick USEC or BEAR, if we pick USEC we get Western related Weapons.

Maps like Labs and Shoreline should have a bias to drop Western ammunition as opposed to dropping Russian ammunition, making it more lore friendly and help combat the inflated prices of m4 rounds, making rounds like the m885 super common, and the m8556a1 and m855a1 uncommon-semi rare and m995 mostly found behind locked rooms or area's that seem like a lot of equipment was stored.",68,1585635824,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs7te4/western_rounds_and_drop_sources/,EscapefromTarkov,1

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate this game so much, it's so good.

&amp;#x200B;

I've owned this game since December of 2019 but only really started playing as of a week ago, and I can safely say I have played almost every day for at least half the day. It's incredible. The graphics are beautiful! The sound design makes me feel all tingly with every footstep! The movement has weight to it and every action and feature has so much depth and care put into it that if someone told me that this was a finished product put on the market I would believe them without a doubt. The love put into this piece of software is so plentiful it's practically seeping out of my monitor every time I boot it.

I've watched videos, read posts on forums and the subreddit, and gotten a good idea of what to expect when I hop into my first raid. Seeing people get into firefights or make their way out with fat loot is amazing. The ideas of Chads, Rats, the blessed Equalizer Mosin, and exploring abandoned urban-scapes with a gun in hand always has me itching to get into a raid, to hit that 'Escape from Tarkov' button on the main menu every time I see it.

&amp;#x200B;

And when I press it, never have I felt such excitement evacuate my body so quickly.  


When I see the 'cancel' button vanish from the loading screen and I'm locked in for the raid, the anxiety is almost overwhelming as I walk onto the concrete of Interchange with a Mosin, a scav vest, and a paper mache armored vest, because I know that in a few minutes I'm either going to walk out of the raid without any kills or loot or I'm going to find fat stacks and get shot 25 minutes into the round. Every raid, I think about who could be around the corner, who could be watching the exits, who could be camping the sight lines, but it doesn't matter. I'm just a level 6 fat doink for the veteran chad who heard my heartbeat footsteps through his super amplifying late-game headset and shot me with a bullet worth more than my rifle. And all it took was 25 of the most anxiety-driving, paranoia-inducing, fight-or-flight-maintaining minutes of my life. Of my 40 raids, I've only ""survived"" 3, with 8 Run Throughs, and 29 deaths. My average life-span dropped from 50 minutes to less than 20 in about 24 hours.

Or maybe it's the scavs. They shouldn't be this difficult for me, I know that much, but I can never figure out what makes them tick. They spot me before I spot them, they shoot from the strangest angles, and even with the 'Equalizer' Mosin Nagant, I can never reliably take them down. All the while, they have near pin-point accuracy, a hunting rifle or shotgun, and usually buddies just around the corner. I know it's not the game's fault, I need to Git Gud, but it's hard to Git Gud when playing offline just ends in me getting creamed by the AI over and over again anyways without feeling like I'm learning anything from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

It fucking sucks. I love it. And I want to walk you through my thoughts as I play this game because god damn it I need to tell someone about what it's like because nobody I know plays this god forsaken gem of a video game.

&amp;#x200B;

Booting up the game always feels like I'm hopping back into somewhere I can fit in, where I can relax and do some trading. I can customize and organize my stash and trade with the traders. I make sure my SKS collection is insured and my prized MP-153 fits snugly where I need it to. It's so relaxing, and I can't count how many times I've stared longingly at the Flea Market, knowing that when I open that up, I'll be able to get my hands on the one thing I'v always wanted: A source to buy the Scoped Mosin.   


I spend hours looking at the traders inventories, knowing they'll never update because all of them are only level 1, but I still hope that maybe, maybe I'll find a weapon part that I can use to actually customize literally anything in my stash. Sometimes, if I'm feeling generous, I'll put down what little money I have for a PM pistol just so I can feel like I did something. It's almost theraputic, which is great, because when I get bored of this and eyeball the ""Escape from Tarkov"" button, I really do need a bit of that therapy when I get back.

Preparing to go to Tarkov is always fun in and of itself. I look at the Scav option, then my PMC, and slowly I've realized, raid after raid, that choosing Scav is a setback because the only difference between me and the Scav is that the Scav has a timer on it. I die all the same and I can never keep a piece of gear beyond more than one run. At least I can choose what I have on me when I die as a PMC. 

Usually I walk onto the streets of Tarkov with a Mosin Nagant, maybe an SKS if I'm feeling fancy, sling, bank robber carrier vest, PACA, and a helmet manufactured in the cold war. No meds, just a handful of Mosin rounds in the Alpha Container. This outfit costs less than the snickers in his pocket and  it's all insured. And I know what you're thinking. 'No wonder you're so doing so bad, you're using a bolt action rifle with the worst gear in the game, you won't kill anyone but yourself with this.' and to that I say yes, you're right, but I'll explain why later.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I look at the locations and go to Interchange. Literally every other map outside of Interchange does not exist to me.

&amp;#x200B;

People have always said to go to Customs to learn the map and play the game. That was a fucking lie. Customs is not a nice place. Customs is where my time and loot goes to die. It's a black hole of rubles and happiness. It's where crackshot scavs live and every tree or overturned car has a luxury rifle sticking out of it watching the roads, loaded with depleted-uranium-armor-piercing-slug-explosive-sabot-hunter-killer rounds that I will never get to see in my stash, only going through my skull at 300 m/s. Never, in my many adventures in Customs both in online and offline, have I thought ""wow, that was fun. I'm glad I spent my time on this map."" That map is the only reason I've not even done the very first Prapor task yet. I can't walk 5 steps without getting lit up by the Heavy from TF2. And don't even get me started in the factory part of the map that has only one way out through a gate then a hole in the wall. Yes, I know there's more than one way, but I don't have the keys or the map knowledge to figure that the fuck out.

Interchange is my nest because of the parking lot under the mall. I know what's up there, in the halls of the main Mall, and I'm not about to fuck around and find out that there's an SVD poking out from behind the sandbags covering the entire hallway while his buddy pokes around the outlets with an anti-tank gun and with a wacked-out armor-to-player ratio. I'm staying in the dark, where there's maybe one scav at most,  who's inevitably going to kill me, and not a player in sight. It's where I can loot in peace. I can find weapons and gear in peace. I can run around and have my fun for a few minutes before I'm late for my appointment with Mr. Kolashnikov outside. It's the only place where I can feel any sort of progress and happiness mixed with the anxiety. 

So I hit ready, then I load in, and I shit my pants sprinting towards the mall, and depending on where I spawn and how the first two minutes go in the round, I'll know how the round will end with frightening accuracy. You see, as someone who knows fuckall about what he's doing, I've realized I only have three ways out of this match. I either find some fat loot and get styled on by a Tarkov god, find fuckall and get out with 3 exp and 20 minutes wasted, or I get shot in the back after 30 minutes with 0 experience, half an hour wasted, and more than likely my Mosin taken. I still wonder how I got to level 6 at all. 

But playing video games isn't about the numbers, it's about fun, and I found my way of having fun with what little gear I have in my stash. With a mix of economy-class loadouts, insurance, and absolutely no concern for my well being, I've found this game to be a complete blast! The tension of sneaking around, knowing that at any moment if I slip up I'll be blasted away, and slowly creeping through the loot and gear I can find, it's exhilarating and with little to no risk. How? Well, I'll tell you how, it's because *I'm poor as fuck and have poor as fuck tools.* 

By bringing a ghetto-ass armor vest, a helmet that heard the mountains speaking Dari in the Afghan war, and a Rifle that had to endure a communist revolution, two world wars, and a cold war to end up in the hands of my stupid ass, I can insure that absolutely nobody that has more than two firing braincells will ever take what I have when they find my pathetic body lying in the dirt 30 feet from the exfil point. Thanks to that cheap, fat fuck Prapor, I can pay him pennies to insure it all, and usually most of it comes back to me in two days with only a few Mosin rounds lost in transit! I can play with no fucks to give, and if something gets stolen, it's dirt cheap anyways!

And I'm sure you're thinking why would I bring a garbage vest to a run, it's a waste of rubles, and you're right, but I just feel extra-naked not wearing one. still, sometimes I do runs with no armor at all! It doesn't matter, the scavs shoot through it all the same! I don't even need meds because I'll never survive long enough to even apply a bandage! And then my PMC wakes up back at his hideout with a headache twelve hours later, naked and hurting, only for me to put him back outside again because 33% health means nothing when 1 bullet kills you at 100% anyways! It makes the sting of missing my shot because of a massive lag spike and paying the ultimate price for it a bit less painful. A bit.

But I can't blame the lag for my firefight woes. I just suck. In my 40 raids I think I've killed... four, maybe five scavs? And usually, it's in a scav run, and I die right after to *another* scav. The only dog tags I've gotten was on a scav run when I came across the body of some poor sod who was already long since dead. I can never feel like I can put a bullet on target no matter the circumstances. I'm usually ambushed anyways, so the only shots I fire are frantic reflex-clicking as I try to figure out where the shooting is coming from before I black the fuck out and die. No matter the weapon, the bullet, the angle of attack, I can never seem to kill anyone. I just miss and get domed by a guy in a walking tank outfit. It's hard to Git Gud when 'practice' against PMC's takes 20-30 minutes to start and lasts only 3 seconds.

It's like an exercise in Nihilism. The moment my man steps on the Mall's property, I know I'm already dead and it's just gonna take 20 minutes for that bullet to get snug in my chest, but by god im gonna enjoy those 20 minutes. I'll put on the MGS soundtracks in the background because I've tried playing focused with headphones, I still can't hear fuckall beyond my own thundering footsteps (yes, I know you can use the scroll wheel to get quieter, but I still feel like everyone in a 10 mile radius can hear my thundering step). I'll loot and navigate the underground like the rat I am and enjoy managing my inventories so the Chad that blows me away will be thankful that I organized my loot for him. Maybe I'll even kill a scav and make the run worth it, even if I do die! i'll get 100 xp which is more than I'll ever get if I even *actually* survive the raid!

Speaking of EXP, the only thing that keeps me salty is that doing damage to another player doesn't grant EXP, even a little. I can get into a firefight and die in the first 5 minutes of a raid and go away with  nothing, keeping me further and further from my precious Flea Market.

But anyways, I've only seen this once before, but very, very rarely, I'll do something impossible. No, not kill someone, but actually escape with a big bag of loot. I've seen god, and god is a full ScavBP of gear. 50k Rubles, enough to get me back up to the 300k I started seriously playing with, and keep my happiness going for just a little longer. That euphoria, only slightly dampened by the 'Run Through' status on the end screen, is what keeps me thinking about the game. It keeps me wondering, maybe if I tweaked this, or tried this weapon, or went this way through the map, I'll actually have more consistently good runs. I know it won't matter, I'll still get shot like a dog in the street, but it keeps me excited. It keeps me loading the game again and again. 

Even if I only get one successful run every three days with 10 raids a day.

And I'm bleeding rubles with every raid because I can't aim and getting proper aim practice takes ages.

And everything available to me doesn't make sense, like that fat fuck Prapor selling me an SVD scope when he knows damn well nobody in the shop has an SVD for sale.

And every run only gives me 3 exp because just looting doesn't net you anything and even cuts your exp in half because 'run through'.

And my only successful runs are scav runs, so none of the EXP passes through and all I get out of it is the gear the scav went in with, which is gonna be lost in the next PMC run anyways.

Even with all that... I uhh... I'll... enjoy it?

fs6h6t,Demon173,A Potentially Great Idea For The Game!,"I'll try to keep things short because this posted is directed towards the busy escape from tarkov devs.

Suggestion : I believe a player should be able to transition a mag check into a reload without having to wait for your character to seat the mag back into their firearm. 

Reasoning : Its not only more realistic, but it still keeps checking your mags a risk, because you're still stuck in the mag check animation OR reload animation and vulnerable to pushes. There also isn't a way to cheese it to get faster reloads because the added step of checking the mag will ALWAYS make it longer then any basic reload a player could do. 

&amp;#x200B;

fs5sja,Fenoremore,I propose to prohibit the resale of things on flea market,"I believe that the resale of things should be closed and only things found in the RAID could be sold. While NOT REMOVING the LIMIT on the purchase. Then the balance would be better because people WOULD have to use either very weak cartridges or very expensive ones, which means that the armor would have a great value. Now you can buy an m995 cartridge for 1500 and it penetrates any armor like a hot knife butter. It's not fair. Such a cartridge as the m995 should cost 3-4 thousand per shot at least, as well as people should constantly use DIFFERENT weapons and different cartridges, and not only buy M4 with m855a1 ammo and play exclusively with it.

For example, you took m4, spent your ammo limit for one RAID, and now you need to take AK or FAL

And so that the game was fair and people did not run with axes, I suggest that you prohibit putting things in the pouch during the RAID. So if you want to take something out of the RAID, you have to do it alive. Dead? So you don't get anything.

All of these changes are aimed at getting people to use different weapons, different cartridges, and different game styles.

On the fact that high-level armor was really valuable and protected from most threats, and killing through such armor would be either the achievement of skill, or the achievement of money. These changes are aimed at ensuring that people try to survive in the game and feel the atmosphere of tarkov.",15,1585626395,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs5sja/i_propose_to_prohibit_the_resale_of_things_on/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I made it so new content downloaded there, made it download there, and huzzah, the launcher is there. Then, I try to download the game. It says the destination is Drive B, in the proper file and everything. It then proceeds to tell me there’s not enough space on the mostly full drive, drive A. It even lists out a file that’s supposedly on drive A. This is confusing, as there wasn’t that file there beforehand. Apparently, it made a file there just to try to install it there. Why?

fs4uks,RealPiledrive,Flea Market Changes,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

With the recent flea market changes being made to making you hit level 10, More changes should also be made.

&amp;#x200B;

When the main story comes into the game (With around another 100+ quests or so) they should tie the flea market to story progression.

&amp;#x200B;

So they could make it that you need to complete a certain amount of the story (or all of it) and be a certain level (Level 20+) to be able to unlock and use it.

&amp;#x200B;

This would stop low levels from running around in the best gear and also stop the ones who just sit and play the flea market all day. (It would force to to actually get in and do raids).

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully they bring this in.",15,1585622469,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs4uks/flea_market_changes/,EscapefromTarkov,1

There is no way to really have fun when you are new. 99% of players you meet cannot be hurt by the best of your weapons and 99% of players you meet can kill you with a single bullet even when wearing the best of your armor. Sometimes, spawns will put you in a place where you are forced into a firefight and thus, you die. Quite a few early quests tell you to go somewhere high heat, and thus, you die. The only way to actual progress (or to not run out of gear because you keep dying) is to play like a super bitch. Crawling, hiding, waiting, avoiding everywhere but the most deserted places at the off chance you might find something to sell for some profit. But even then chances are you will die from a player sniper at the other side of the map who has no intention of looting your body (I have been killed more times to players with the bloody crowns than anything else combined. And then you play scav and honestly, scav is funner than anything else early game. At least then you can have some good fun against player scavs when they inevitably try and kill you. But that's fun. You are both similarly equipped and you can actually have a battle. Well, at least until a single geared player shoots both of you from a hill a mile away. The most fun I've had in the game was when I managed to kill a geared PMC with a pistol shot to the face after he'd been in a fight. I took his gear and was instantly faced by other PMC's but...I could fight back. I got one kill, then another, then another and then I died. But I had fun because I could fight.

I know this game is meant to be 'hardcore' but this is really not hardcore. It's like a cliff you have to climb where the pricks that are at the top keep throwing rocks at you. A fix? Preferred matchmaking. Make it so low leveled players are likely to play against other low level players. Maybe more wipes so people don't stay at the highest gear level for so long. Or, just give low level players a chance by giving them access to better ammunition so they can do some damage or/and improving their armor so it isn't completely useless. I grinded all the way to level ten because I hoped I could buy some AP ammo just to find out that a single mag would cost more than the gun itself. I'd like a chance in fights and I am sure other noobs would too. I know it probably doesn't effect half of you since you've played since the start of the last wipe and grew with everyone else but it's impossible to enjoy yourself when every fight is dictated by equipment rather than skill. And yes, I know you can get a shot off to the face with some low leveled rifles, I've done it a few times. But in those scenarios, looting the bodies is basically death. They are also rare considering other players tend to get their shots off first since a shot to the core can actually do damage and all of those players have access to automatic weapons with large mags while weapons, mags and ammo are all expensive for me.",16,1585619012,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs3ynk/early_game_is_awful/,EscapefromTarkov,1

 So I thought of a solution: There should be an option to wait for your entire party to load the map and then start searching for a match.
 Or make the Waiting for Players actually wait for everyone to load.

 I think that  this simple solution could make the game more enjoyable and fair to people who load after everyone .",1,1585617610,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs3ljh/there_should_be_an_option_where_matching_for_a/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Round2: He got instashot and i couldnt kill the guy even nades couldnt kill that guy. He seemed 100% invincible. Im not joking. One other dude pushed me (3rd party) and he died within seconds (geared) a flick was enough. Of course the other dude seemed to have some magic dragon armor. Im sure it was T8, unreleased that made my M995 feel like some garbage PS ammo.

Round3: One player that lag switched like crazy pushed us, no one could hit him. It felt like busting bullets into a sponge. Cool. I died very far behind coverm of course what else?! Remember PUBG? My friend - he made it out.

Round4: Straight asian cheater. HUYA324232143whatever

Round5: Speedhacker pushes us on Reserve, im done.

After that i hit ALT and F4. What a shit experience.

Right now just stay away from the game, im serious. Why would you waste your time in this cheater infested game? Whe yould i play against someone that uses cheats all the time? It makes no sense. There is nothing to gain. The whole experience is fucked.

Even if i dont play labs, shoreline has the same idiots every couple raids. Its so sad. I have seen this countless times.

fs3187,Majorllama66,This is easily the greatest game I have ever played....,"...when it is working as intended.   


There is not a single game that even comes CLOSE to touching this game when it is firing on all cylinders.   


Problem is... this game hasn't been firing on all cylinders for a few months now.   


I would say that ever since the first twitch event the game has been in a constant state of ""kinda broken"".  


We are still dealing with server issues that started from that event. We are still dealing with several issues that stem from those server issues. Here is a short list from just the last 10 games I played:   


1. Only taking one person from a party into a match instead of everyone that is partied up. 
2. Automatic guns only firing once per click for a few clicks (fire mode is always checked at the start of raid and set to auto). 
3. Grenades have no audio (multiple friends have this issue).
4. Grenades killing through the floor/ceiling.
5.  Unable to loot any of the people we kill unless we alt+f4 and reconnect (multiple friends have this issue).
6. Heavy stutters throughout the match. Usually right when we are about to engage someone.    


Out of the last 10 raids there was been only 1 where we did not run into at least 1 of these issues. Its really hard to love and continue to play a game that only actually works 10 percent of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that its a beta game and there are going to be issues, but I have never played a beta with so many long running and constant issues.   


There was brief time for a few weeks after .12 dropped where the game had no stutters and no consistent issues. I miss that brief window of time. It was the best window of time.   


I love this game and cant wait to see when it is ""complete"". Im sure there is a large number of us who cannot wait for this game to finally be released.",4,1585615463,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs3187/this_is_easily_the_greatest_game_i_have_ever/,EscapefromTarkov,1

But due to the vertical FOV reference (instead of horizontal which most games use - or is it the other way around?) and the fact that the slider can't go lower than 50, any scope appears extremely small and making out enemies at medium distance when not ADSing is often quite difficult.

I've tried adjusting this manually in the ini files, but I'm not seeing any improvements.

I couldnt reliably defend myself, and theres no glory in dying. And 2, I couldnt carry the all the loots I found. So I upgraded my rat gear and i have these suggestions for people. Take an attack 2 backpack, a pp-19, and a large chest rig. Something like the belt a+b. I personally just use the tactec or other armored chest rig. First run after upgrading the kit, I pull 1.4 mil. It was a lucky run, but I consistently get 700-900k. As for the pp-19, it's great against hatchlings, and you can leg meta the geared bois.",3,1585613234,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs2fbn/a_suggestion_to_my_fellow_rats/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fs28a5,Dramare,Spawns need a fix in customs?,"Basically lost all my gear twice cause I got a shit spawn on customs. You know the one that puts you outside crossroads? Yeah. That one. You are nearly always guaranteed to run into a player in the open, immediately. Pretty much every time I start there I instantly have a guy moving towards me from trailer park, there's always at least one person camping up by railroad to port and the actual train yard gets instantly nabbed by everyone else. I'm pretty low level so my gear isn't great against someone who gets the jump on me but it seems like the left side of customs is hell for a spawn position. You are completely boxed in, the spawns are easily remembered and close by and your options of escape are quite limited. The equipment gab is quite vast in the game, which is fine as long as you can give options for a quick retreat from the chads but that spawn area in particular really feels like you are fish in a barrel. It feels like my only option for survival is to hide in a bush or shed for half the game for the players to move on but that's not the best of fun. I know there's problems involved with increasing spawn locations and so on, but there's also problems involved by placing a spawn in a corner of a map with three routes of escape and a bunch of players in front of you and that escape. Right side customs is fine. Right side left spawn is fine. But whenever I join customs it really does feel like a lottery of hitting that spawn in the corner and having to try and escape. 3 way fire fights are rare in customs, but I have gotten into three of them from that spawn point and none I survived. I mean, I don't exactly have many ideas on what to do to go about fixing it but basically being instantly cornered by guys with good loot doesn't exactly seem like a fair scenario.",11,1585612521,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs28a5/spawns_need_a_fix_in_customs/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fs1s3c,Frankloco,My feedback on the reworked Weight System!,"Hello fellow Rats, Chads, Mods, and Devs!

As reddit seems to be the platform where feedback is appreciated and accepted by either devs or discussed with other players. I thought I would share my thoughts on this recent aspect that has received a rework, which is the Weight System!

TLDR at the end of the post!

To start off, I think the reworked weight system is a definite plus side to the game! It adds new dynamics to the game which make the game more tactical and interesting. 
I haven't been looting the same as I was before, each item is a consideration instead of spam clicking everything. It's good!
Having to think if you are going to be dropping your backpack before entering an area, adds a smart, subtle consciousness aspect to it. 
Falling from edges while being to heavy will break your legs is quite realistic to me as well, don't mind that. 
The short build up to reach maximum running speed is in a gray area for me. On the one hand I think it's good game mechanic, but I have the feeling that it might need some slight tweaking, in either the drain percentage or build up speed.
After playing a while with my buddy on the new patch, we are quite amazed at the sound changes that the weight system adds. I admire the concept of being louder when you're heavy, and sneaking becomes more difficult. But when you are super fat, you can pretty much be heard walking across the map. The range feels a bit off, but what bothered me most, is that it might be more of a disadvantage towards the other players than towards yourself. Because sound of the steps appear to be so close to you, that you (as the other player), are expecting someone to come around a corner according to normal sound, but the situation being completely different because the other person is overweight (e.g.: I could hear my friend as if he was 4m away from me, while being on the other end of the Labs tunnel). I get the feeling that an additional distortion or echo of some sort should be added to the sound of the footsteps.
Finally it balances the gameplay styles more, which is a proper addition to me. Rats can't take their sweet time and run towards extract after looting up the dead bodies, and Chads can't dominate every corner of the map within a minute. Most stimulants become more usefull now (blue labs stim went up from ~20k towards ~50-60k). Overall I think it has been a great addition and people just needed to learn to adapt to it, and accept that they should think more about their actions. After all, it's a change that makes Tarkov even more of a Tactical FPS, which in my honest opinion, is awesome!

TLDR in order of the post; Most changes are good, the decreasement of walking speed, dropping your backpack before or in combat situations, breaking legs when falling from heights is a juicy touch, the movement speed build up when you want to run is a nice little addition, but might need some slight tweaks, steps being louder when being heavy is a smart strategical addition, but can easily throw other players off (needs tweaking in it's sound distortion and range), balances the gamestyles (Rat or Chad) a lot more, and most stimulants become more usefull than before!
Overall, great changes and makes the game even more tactical, which in my opinion, is amazing!

Feel free to discuss any point of my feedback! Keep it decent and civilised!",3,1585610909,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs1s3c/my_feedback_on_the_reworked_weight_system/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fs0z3v,TheRealMatsky,"What are your thoughts on stopping the rampant hachetlings and pistoling's rushing every keycard spawn, ledx spawn, ect.","I don't know how much you guys play shoreline but some of the best loot there is gold spots, ledx's and keycard spawns. All these are bum rushed by multiple pistoling every match and they just loot until they did filling up their gamma case. This means if I manage to get to one room with good loot. Most other rooms and spawns will have been checked by pistoling's for good loot to put in their gamma. In my opinion if you want that loot you should have to fight/stealth for it and extract with it. Not just bum rush it. So what ideas do you have to try and reduce pistol and hachetlings. And dont answer with ""there more than enough loot for them not to put it all in their gamma"" yes but none of it is anywhere near as profitable as rushing keycard/ledx spawns/gold spawns. And dont come at me with the ""beat them there"" because I do. But i cant cover 2 wings and 2 floors on each wing with good loot spawns.

fs0iov,TheRealMatsky,Alot of you ars gonna disagree but secure container should be changed or removed. And the flea market needs to be removed.,"1. Secure containers reward rushing loot loot spawn and dying/dcing. Removing or making it that you cant put stuff inside it during raid so can only bring in stuff and use it during raid and not put stuff in it. This would massively fix hachette and pistol runners. Take shoreline for example. Ledx's, gfx, bitcoins, red key/blue key cards ect. If you had to actually fight for these it wouldnt be people just bum rushing it with no gear and just looting everything before they die. This would incentivise playing stealth or defending yourself. People are gonna say ""but theres only so much they can put in there"" ""plenty of loot to go around"" ""just get there first"" but the thing is take a game 3x3 that's 9 slots. 1 for your keytool. Then 8 slots to put all the ledx's, gfx, bitcoins ect. And that's more than enough space to fit all the actual good loot. Then players who fight for it are left with guns, meds, ect other loot that just isnt worth nearly as much. 

2. If 2 people get to a room full of good loot. The person who gets their first shouldnt be rewarded. It should be the person who wins the firefight and survives.

3. The flea market is just awful. Trade bots, price gauging ect. Yh it's nice to be able to instantly but what you want but I think using traders and finding what you want in raid should be how the game is run. It would massively increase the fun of looking for specific items.",13,1585606441,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fs0iov/alot_of_you_ars_gonna_disagree_but_secure/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Got his weapon and with it killed the 5 bots/scavs. So many guns and armor . Didn t really get them all because i paniced when i saw my energy and water lvl so low . Literally had 0 energy and 11 water . Went outside to the heating pipe but there was no way i could get there before dying . Had such luck to find some juice in those 2 houses near the armored train . And because of the new weight system , i couldnt run . I had like 10 sec before dying but i made it .

frz84e,TheRealMatsky,Alot of you are gonna disagree but secure containers and flea market are the bane of this game,"1. Secure containers reward rushing loot loot spawn and dying/dcing. Removing these would massively fix hachette and pistol runners.

2. If 2 people get to a room full of good loot. The person who gets their first shouldnt be rewarded. It should be the person who wins the firefight and survives.

3. The flea market is just awful. Trade bots, price gauging ect. Yh it's nice to be able to instantly but what you want but I think using traders and finding what they want in raid should be how the game is run. It would massively increase the fun of looking for specific items.",3,1585602254,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frz84e/alot_of_you_are_gonna_disagree_but_secure/,EscapefromTarkov,1

frz37e,svppho,This sub-reddit needs to take a good hard look at itself...,"Day after day this sub-reddit continues to impress me with the sheer amount of its own bullshit. Everyone on here hopes that Papa Nik sees their post and take their suggestions for what Tarkov is and should be; I hope he ignores the lot of you. See, outside of a few of you whose opinions either matter or a well thought out, your opinions seem to fluctuate from day to day and based on what gets you or is getting the most updoots. How can a developer take you seriously or consider your points if the hivemind changes them everyday. I have watched so many of you bitch and moan that EOD/Gamma Case is pay2win and now I am seeing posts popping up that have people suggesting that the way to combat hackers is to have BSG sell currency in micro transaction form to get rid of hackers. Which won’t work by the way and only allows BSG to shlep off the anti-cheat issue even longer because hey, there is a half-assed fix for it.  

To the certain sub-section of new players, no one gives a shit that you are leaving. Just like no one probably gives a shit about this post I am writing. This game takes time to learn and just because you struggle with it and refuse to put in the time or ask for help you feel the need to let everyone know you are out. Some of you watched Summit stream the game once and though “fuck, I could wreck ass in that game”, good for you I am glad it brought you to Tarkov. You know what I watched? I watched Summit eat ass for ages, quit, come back and put in the effort and now plays Tarkov pretty regularly. Once you realize you can’t micro transaction your way into being average, you might start enjoying yourself.

Everyday I look at my feed and the sub-reddit home and am hit with a wave of posts that all echo each other. Desync killed me, there are hackers on labs, queues are too long. Yeah, we all know because we all have the same issues. BSG is working on it but 70 posts a day don’t make it go faster. We get it, you lost your M4 and want it back. This game doesn’t owe you loot. Speaking of loot. You all bitch about the hatchlings and pistolings rushing all the good gear. You know who promotes that shit? This sub-reddit. Your posts of look what I got on my SCAV run, look at my hatchet run, look at my pistol run are all supported by this community. Sure BSG makes more viable to do those things, doesn’t mean you fucks have to promote it and then be confused as to why its popular. 

So many idiots on here... I could go on but you get the point.

There are a lot of elements about this game that are poorly developed, a pain in the ass, need fixing or are just garbage. There are a lot of really amazing things too. Both good and bad things need highlighting when it’s conducive to the games improvement. Most of the posts here aren’t that. Blaming BSG, or hackers, or sweaties, or whatever only goes so far. At some point all of us as a community need to think about what we want and what we are promoting. Right now, we are promoting a lot of garbage because we don’t know what we want on a given day and its our fault.",114,1585601812,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frz37e/this_subreddit_needs_to_take_a_good_hard_look_at/,EscapefromTarkov,1

How do you guys do it that still go strong? I've played a lot of games that have been infested by hackers and it has never bothered me like this. Doing hatchet/pistol runs doesn't really interest me, after all it was the deep weapons customization that attracted to the game in the first place. But right now it feels like I'm questioning every death, was it legit or not and it just puts me in a bad mood.

I then change my password on the website. Go to the launcher and copy paste the same password I just changed it too. It gives me a 60 min wait time.

My first game of the day was near train yard I've noticed some dead bodies, turns out someone wiped most gluhar guards and died in the process so I looted up some sweet gear and extracted, my second game as PMC someone killed me from my left hand side, I paid attention, saw absolutely nobody and the moment I ran to get to safer position some silenced dude started to shoot at me, no more than 50 meters away, I can't see him. The next game, some guy with 6th sense looked outside the window away from firefight he was in on the other side of the building and saw me, I got to safety and got dinked by God knows who between 2 rooms, across the street from another building... How can I become so perceptive of everyone around me if they're not giving much info themselves? How and when can I call cheats? Is there a report feature? I feel like other people see a big red flashing flag above my head and they blend in to the background when I'm within their view range.

Perhaps it's something to do with my settings? Did I miss some crucial step in setting up my game? I tend to be a super careful player who always assumes likely scenarios to take place but still, I feel like I miss something. I have Nvidia Freestyle enabled but I just keep getting shatted on every time.

frw7pa,SixOneZil,One way to combat cheaters/farmers,"I don't know how sound this is, and I'm not saying its the best solution of all, but hear me out.

What about implementing a ""pay-for-roubles"", in game, from BSG ? Essentially, pay 5€, get X roubles / USD, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't yell yet, hear me out.

In other games such as World of Warcraft, chinese farmers were a plague. They were taking all the farm spots, were incredibly annoying and spammy, and just overall ruined the immersion of the game. Lets face it, it's not fun to see someone either take all your mobs, and that won't even fight back when you attack him.

You'd get friend requests, private messages for farmign websites, etc. Pretty much where tarkov is headed : already lots of ads in lobbies and cheaters earning ez roubles to sell online.

&amp;#x200B;

What I mean is, a lot of cheaters do it for money ( I know this from a factual, reliable source, I've interviewed one of the biggest cheat resellers in the non china world) and undercutting their work would completely render them unmarketable.

There would still be that majority of players cheating for fun / skill / whatever reason. Those annoying streamers that wanna look cool. Fine. But the big majority of those trying to make money wouldn't be able to do so, because the customer would go to BSG : a more reliable, faster, cheaper source of roubles.

&amp;#x200B;

It worked for WoW, and it's not that much ""pay-to-win"", all things considered. I prefer this over having chinese cheaters every second game.

Also, this can probably be improved on, but what do you guys think of the base idea? Let's try and have a constructive conversation.",29,1585592831,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frw7pa/one_way_to_combat_cheatersfarmers/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I have Textures and Shadows on High, the 3 sliders around 50%, everything disabled besides TAA High and Ansostropic Filtering turned on. 

I still get small stutters here and there but other than that my performance is extremely good. My fps on every map is through the roof.

And no, they didn't see where I went. I have no problem admitting when I was outplayed or I was seen entering a building etc...
A good example is the Storage area on customs. People were fighting in front of Big Red and the train tracks. I moved from Trailer park spawn to the Storage area, slow crouching between containers into a random container on the far left side and behind a door. Everything was quiet. Did not move at all. I waited for 2 minutes for the fight to end and then I hear running towards me. Then walking... And without hesitation a dude ran into the container I was in and turned straight towards me. I did not move at all, did not ADS or did anything that I know of that causes sound.

Does anyone agree? 
Also, maybe bsg should add various options as to where can we place the sight for proper eye release and just for comfort of use and variable stock postions maybe? For example, on M4 style rifles, middle mouse click will fully extend or collapse the stock instead of folding. This will help with stash management and have an appropriate viewmodel in first person.

You can go the way of No Man's Sky.

frskjc,_Nordic,(serious) How is this game not Pay 2 Win?,"Serious question about the different versions of the game. How is this not blatantly pay 2 Win? 

I'm going to ignore the gear you get between the versions, but that makes it even worse.

The base version of the game you get a 2x2 secure container and a stash of 10x26.

The EOD version you get the 3x3 (125% more secure storage), able to get more shit out of raid guaranteed and a fully upgraded stash (worth ~ 30 million rubbles)

Now I understand you don't get to take that stash into the game with you, but you don't have to spend money getting that stash either. Having 30 million extra rubbles seems likes a sorta massive advantage to me.

We all get mad at people who buy in game money for real money because we consider that P2W, but somehow this is not?

Seriously wondering how this is not considered pay to win.",26,1585581184,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frskjc/serious_how_is_this_game_not_pay_2_win/,EscapefromTarkov,1

frs3hg,Lord_Arkus_Ren,"Insurance in labs, details below","Since Labs requires an access card, I think it would be a good idea to provide scav insurance hunters with a keycard to gain the ability to have functioning insurance in Labs. 
Details:
The Insurance provider should be Fence. Sneaky, mysterious, it fits his agenda. He has higher insurance cost than therapist (+50%) and each raid you have to provide a labs access keycard. 

IMO this is balanced and it will be expensive (250k ish depending on prices and value of gear brought in) 

This would work as many players bring BIS gear which often exceeds 1m+ in value, thus making it worth it. Also, with the new overweight system, people are less likely to take larger armors/weapons as they weigh too much

frrmbs,Hulkster80,Fire side chat about EFT,"The EFT community is very passionate about this game. The amount of support BSG has received, especially since .12 has gone live has been amazing!   The game is growing, especially since Nakita has mentioned this many times on their twitch streams. Streamers have really spent countless hours advertising EFT on their own channels. I personally am starting to get worried about the constant themes I’m reading on reddit and EFT forums. Here are a few issues that have not been discussed or fixed by BSG. To be honest I believe they are getting worse from my own personal experience and the amount of chatter we read here is growing daily. Do keep in mind server performance chatter has died down tremendously even though they are still present. 

Stutters
Cheaters
Bugs


Prior to .12 release the hype of stutters being removed with the new unity engine was the talk. Other streamers would talk up the engine since they did their own research with other developers about the positive progress their game made when going to the new engine. The community would put together useful resources to help change settings to optimize the game and get better performance. There was a new option put in pace to help with performance. I don’t know what it did to help. There has been no communication from BSG about this topic. No clarification or expected changes to take place to ensure these issues would be fixed. The stutters are getting worse and last for way to long. Lets not get into “what’s your specs” because that isn’t the issue. A lot of threads I’ve read people have spent a boat load of their own money and have good PCs. Bottom line BSG is silent and isn’t addressing these issues with respect to the community. 

Cheaters, this is pretty self explanatory. Highlight videos of eft, posts here, and their forums are plastered with posts about cheaters.  Nakita has said battle eye is working in full force. What does that mean Nakita? Nothing is being done and our continued hard work is being handed to these cheaters that actually make a real life profit and sell in game goods for real world cash. BSG said months ago they don’t allow in game items to be sold, I continue to see it present. BSG has done nothing to help remedy this or protect the community. BSG reacts when the community actually raises help about game breaking cheats that are taking place. The last big cheat was people were actually having gear removed from their body while alive in raid. It raised some serious concern in the community, I wonder how many people actually stopped playing because of this scare? Regardless why do we continue to see cheaters in the game daily? Why are their sites selling in game items? 

Bugs are here and in full force. Every patch it seems like one step forward twenty backwards. Sure there are patches almost daily but what do they do? What’s been fixed? What bugs are present BSG and what’s the solution on fixing them with a timeline? It’s almost like we have to change our gameplay to work around the bugs instead of you coming up with a solution. 

I came to reddit because posts are being deleted very frequently on EFT forums. BSG does their own damage reduction without any communication. Any ticket submitted says it can take ten days for a response. I’ve had one go pay two weeks. The basic response is a copy pasta response without any proper communication from a human being. This community is very passionate and it’s amazing what resources they have put together to provide solutions to fix issues BSG should actually be addressing and fixing on their own.  So when will we actually have communication about these issues? What kind of timeline will be given to address them? 

Here’s hoping something changes, I’m getting tired of these and want to play the game in peace.",15,1585577948,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frrmbs/fire_side_chat_about_eft/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Where people can spawn, walk for 3 seconds and have line of sight on multiple spawns. Dying is part of the game, I get it. However, needlessly dying to poor programming is really irritating.

When we got between train bridge and bus station 2 VSSs started pelting us with rounds from connector , so we think right pull back  deep into forest break the line of sight and stop the engagement cause these were T H I C C bois VSS, FULL AIRFRAME, KILA Armor etc etc. 

There was no real gain from fire fight with other other than  blacked out limbs. We wrapped around to dorms two story through the trees and stopped in the tree line and start scoping it out.

Low and behold I see the same to two guys coming down the street and dudes aiming right at me from t junction at the end of the road. I'm using a pso and he has a red dot. So they both light us up through our shrub coverage and that was the end of that. 

Regardless, I just wanted to preface the question. Why do bad kids use Radars? 

All the gear/ profit you make will be useless when you play without it. You dont improve at the game and you dont learn anything from dying? 

What's point in having good loadouts if when your playing without your radar you die from not having your crutch to hold you up? Whats he point in even playing the game? 

Tarkov for me atleast still gets my heart thumping when you get in crazy situation with a load of good gear and you manage to to somehow fight your way out of it. That's pretty much why I play the game so what is the point if nothing matters anymore? 

Is it the social aspect of showing there friends their stash or pretending to a loot god? Or are they just not willing to improve, learn and grow as a player?

I’ve been playing this game on and off for about 3 years. I’m not amazing, but I do decently and understand the game well. 

However the last 2-3 days I’ve been struggling worse than I have ever before. I can’t seem to get kills, I extracted successfully twice in the countless last few raids and can’t seem to catch a break.

I don’t know what to do. I’m not stressed over losing gear I have plenty of cash, I don’t mind that I’m not making huge plays for 100’s of Ks. My favorite part in this game is making a profit and seeing my stash value go up. 

Every time I die I try to realize what I did wrong, what I can do to avoid death the next time. I also try to put previous raids to the side and move on to the next,but I can’t seem to elude a bullet to the brain. 

So I am asking, what are your strategies to get out of slump when you are struggling in Tarkov or any other game?",7,1585564654,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frof1q/advice_for_a_slump/,EscapefromTarkov,1

frnitp,sandflaxe,Documenting the guide. Part 1,"Hello everyone! Since I am back at this dreaded quest I decided to document my adventures for everyone to read. I started trying this quest for the first time this wipe yesterday (monday 29 march). I will write out what happened and maybe some tips for how you could handle some of the maps. I hope you enjoy the read. TLDR at the bottom ;)

**First try:**

\- Factory: Well i went in with lvl 4 armor and a zhuk helmet with faceshield. I spawned near gate three and had a scav nearby that I could headshot. My dumbass thought it would be smart to immidatly loot him so i had the required exp to leave. I died the moment i hit the floor for the loot from a pmc using an MPX. A quick reminder that i needed to take this quest more seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

**Second try:**

\- Factory: I went in with only a ak-103 and a peepee helmet (tm) I waited for a little bit at my spawn near the factory door exit and left when i started hearing shots near office. I eventually found a scav player at the top of the ramp and doomed him. I could safely scoop up all the loot he had and exited through factory door downstairs.

\- Customs: I spawned near the large boilers in the warehouse with the dead scavyboy. I quickly checked the green boxes for a red rebel. My rat ass cant resist it... Then i made my way through the middle of the map towards the road next too the water. At the road i killed a scav, scooped up his loot and ran over the middle bridge towards the extract. Customs done

\- Reserve: I started at the marked room building in the upper left corner of the map. I ran over the bunkers towards heating pipe and then pmc/scav extract. I sneaked past there because there was a pmc in that building which i could not spot. (tried to sneak in the building but for some reason you cant get up the doorsteps while sneaking :/)  I kept going along the sides of the map and eventually ran in a scav next too the black pawn building. I farely easy killed him but low an behold it was one of gluhars crew. Grenades and zharyas started flying towards me so i bolted towards the dome with two of the rushy rush raiders hot on my heels. I managed to stay ahead of them and quickly extracted from cliff descent. (Since i killed a raider, and not a normal scav i had enough exp from the raid)

\- Labs: I never play labs, this was actually the first time doing it this wipe. I know the map pretty good because i played it alot when it was still free to get in. I spawned in the middle of the map next to the elevators. I ran right towards the garage area and went down in the basements. I started too loot boxes there in case i couldnt find raiders to get to the threshold of 300 exp. Eventually i heared raiders near the extract i wanted to take (Ventilation shaft) I killed two raiders there and the third one didnt peak the door before i safely extracted.

\- Interchange: My plan for interchange was to run around the garages to find a scav, kill him and then leave trough the hole in the wall extract. After 25 min of running around and never finding a scav i heared footsteps on the other side of the wall next to the new hole. I sit around the corner waiting... The steps grow louder and it are actually two sets of footsteps quickly closing in! No way back now.. cant run. As soon as the first pmc runs through the hole i kill him with my m4. The second guy now alerted of my position comes blasting around the corner. I try to shoot him but sadly bite the dust and see a dreaded message: Quest the guide failed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Third try:**

\- Factory: I load in with an adar i looted in my previous try. I spawn near the dead scav with the letter for the prapor/therapist quest. I go left from there downstairs. I hear some footsteps to my right and see a pmc going right towards the middle of the map. I leave him and go left to find a scav to kill. Before i go on towards the barrel spawn i open the extract with the factory key so i have a quick escape after finding a scav. Luckily a scav is nearby and i kill him on the metal stairs going up to the walkway next to office. Quick scoop and loot and extracted through gate 1.

\-Customs: I spawned at the spawn nearest of dorms. I bolted towards the bus station to see if a scav might have spawned there. No luck. I ran towards the construction zone and see a scav standing on top of the middle building. A quick headshot finishes him off so i quickly ran up the stairs to loot his body for the exp requirements. Same as before ran over the middle land bridge but went left this time along the shore. I was only 5 min in the raid so pmcs where probably still around. Next to the blue building with the lockers i hear someone walking around so i wait for a bit in a bush in case it might have been a pmc. Luckily it was a scav and i kill him on the road. No need to loot him though so i quickly ran on and extracted from customs.

\- Interchange: So because i died at interchange at my second try i decided to do it after customs. I did the same strategy again and tried to find a scav somewhere in the garage. Walking close too the hole in the floor leading up to kiba store i see a pmc in the distant running towards him. I fire a couple of shots his way but did not kill him. To risky to go for the kill on him so i bolt to the left and run trough the new (Well lighted i may add) hole in the wall and try to find a scav on that side. Sadely no scavs again... I go up in the back towards goshan and make my way to the front of the store. Surely there most be a scav there right?? RIGHT?? well nope... I make my way back through goshan and to my luck i see mister cowboy scav walking around. I sprint towards him and quickly take him down and loot his cowboy hat from him. With the exp requirements done I go down in the garage again and safely extract through hole in the fence. 

\- Reserve: Same spawn as the first time on the map. This time i make my way down in the large garage and try to find a scav there. No luck sadly. I go to the right and go up in the small sniper tower next to the trainyard. I hear alot of scavs up there and luckily one of them walks in the building which is a easy kill for me. I loot his body quickly and go back down (scavs where blocking that exit. to risky to go out there) and go out at the other side. I run out there and make may way trough the garages towards manhole cover. Luckily no one to be seen and i quickly escape through the sewers. 

\- Woods: Since it was still dark i decided to quickly do woods first before heading back into labs. I gear up in better armor (gen4) and a mt helmet. I spawn near the cliff extract so i quickly make my way towards the lumbermill. I shoot down the sniper scav in hopes he falls down. no luck sadly so i quickly run on towards the car extract. For some reason sthurman is however in these fields (didnt knew it was him untill he started shooting his trusty svd on me later). I try to kill him but he sprints away towards lumbermill and starts shooting at me as soon as he is in cover. No way that im gonna try and fight him however so i matrix dodge all his bullets and run towards the other side of the map in hope to find a scav near the scav house. Sadly when i walk close too the cultist circle i get shot by silenced shot coming from the far right... Someone with a thermal... I try to lay down but his shots still land on me. In the middle of taking my painkiller i get a bullet right through my ear and die in the middle of the woods... Hopes and dreams shattered again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you enjoyed the read! Second part will hopefully be the one where i finished the quest :). But we will have to wait and see. If you want any tips for the quest feel free to ask!

frn8ci,DptBear,Has BSG addressed anything about changes to the flea market? I feel like it could use some tune ups.,"As is there are a lot of annoying things about using the flea market to me -- the menus should be in slightly different locations (for instance add offer shouldn't cover the prices of the thing behind it), the filters could use some adjustments and cleanup (easy access buttons for ""new"" condition, instead of editing the text fields, change it to show trades from traders only, not players, etc), and things like fuel and drinks should show their durability in a way that is visible and filterable (it's so annoying to try to buy fuel).

One more thing that drives me nuts is just the speed that bots snipe the cheap commodities and how often I have to deal with F5 -&gt; Offer not found -&gt; F5 -&gt; Offer not found. I'd suggest adding a ""buy X at price Y"" option for commodities much like steam does for its shop. Want wires? Put an order like ""Buy 7 Wires at &lt; 10400 Roubles"". This has 2 main values: 1) bots can't snipe this -- with this in place you could easily put an order limit just like there is for selling. 2) no more ""Offer not found"" crap because someone got it before you.",21,1585558255,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frn8ci/has_bsg_addressed_anything_about_changes_to_the/,EscapefromTarkov,1

frmokg,gamerbrains,The fate of Tarkov,"
The hackers in this game are going to kill Tarkov, here’s how.

Say you have 100 players in a game

Now put in 10 hackers into this player-base of this game 

Every time a player goes against a hacker and quits the game there are less legitimate players

Which means your chances of running into a hacker are steadily increased 

Which means less and less legitimate players and more and more games consisting of you running into hackers

As this trend increases the game slowly becomes infested with hackers making up the majority of the game, and now the hackers are going up against each other

Which means for the hackers, that this is not fun anymore, because they are getting out-matched by other hackers


So what do you think happens to a game where neither hacker or legitimate player finds fun to play?

I was wondering what other people who are really bad at pvp would think of other alternatives to some quests? For example if the quest is kill 5 pmcs with shotguns, there could be a second option for it like kill 15 scavs with shotguns. The alternative option should be a grind, but would give players who can’t even do pvp a chance at kappa while still allowing players who are good at the game to get it a lot quicker.",3,1585553238,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frmcbz/just_an_idea_for_quests_for_bad_people/,EscapefromTarkov,1

frlubg,busajohn62,HK416 handguard/barrel compatibility,"I whipped this up after spending some ridiculous amount of roubles cause I was pissed off. If you’re a HK loving boi like me I hope this helps alleviate some of the fuckery that could ensue. Maybe this will save some people their hard earned roubles(unless you’re a gate camper). 

Some backstory, I was excited to build my first 416 for some quality wank material. I bough the 14.5” barrel because I knew there was a 14” keymod and the closer the rail to the end of the barrel the bigger the orgasm. I’m a sucker for shrouded suppressors but BSG is not. To my surprise, the hand guard didn’t fit and neither did ANY OTHER HANDGAURD I BOUGHT. So I said fuck it, and got the 16” barrel and low and behold THEY DIDNT FIT THAT EITHER. Low on fucks to give I bought EVERYTHING available on the market and started test fitting. 

I put question marks by the ones that I audibly said “fuck” over.

I really miss the game before the update, not cause the content and the change of the update are bad, but cause of low gears. I don't much solution to bring, my favorite idea is to make secure container like the event, ""brind in raid only items"", but i know people here don't like this thing.

It's easy to see why everyone is slowly not playing anymore, I remember now why I stopped playing before, it takes fucking ages for something to be done.

Maybe it'll be like B.I when they took over Dayz and it'll be decent 100 years later once everyone's lost interest.

Eventually we moved to this small safe room in the underground garage, where you showed me all the loot spawns inside. Then you closed the door and extracted, however I didn't. I was left trapped in this safe room with 2 mins left, absolutely fuming at the fact that I couldn't extract and was completely screwed. I appreciate the nice gesture whoever you are, even though I couldn't extract with any of it.

frkbst,naezzee,Lock client when desync from server.,"so ive been thinking about the desync, stutters and lag switches issue and i think i have an idea on how to mitigate it, and i at the same time itll make lag switches useless.  


currently if you drop connection from the server for a couple seconds, your client still works, and you can still walk and shoot people, then when the client reconnect to server, the server resync to ur client and sends all that catch up information to other clients, for which it appears like speedrunning. i THINK its also causing the infamous stutters at that point. its also why its very easy to make a lagswitch for tarkov, and why they're all over hack forums.  


the fix would simply be to get the client to lock when it desyncs from the server, so that if you lag, you cant walk, shoot or do anything, when you reconnect, the server doesnt have any catch up to do to update other clients, you'd just resume where you were when you started to desync, with some luck not having to update every clients on what you were doing while you were desyncing would prevent the stuttering too.

One of the doors open and this guy, this goddamn lucky mfer is wearing nothing but an ak-74 and starts spraying like a madman all over the room and kills my friend with a headshot before we even have time to react. I didn't shoot at anyone else in the raid as it was quiet but i emptied my whole mag on this guy and did 398 damage and he kills me with one hit through my vulkan's face shield. How the fuck did he live is beyond me..
I understand this is part of the game. It is unforgiving and hardcore. But goddamn I have NEVER EVER in my life played any game as frustrating as this one. Finally when you have some money to spend and you get some nice gear just so you get killed like this by some guy who risks absolutely nothing... I hate this game just as much as i love it and sometimes want to break stuff just as much as I want to play it.

I know that recoil in this game is in a way similar to reality where it is harder to control the gun at its first several shots since you have not yet get used to it.

It's like I don't have a battery in and pull the power cord (which I obviously don't do). 

At first I thought it might be overheating (temps were pretty high) but I cleaned the fans and fins and bought some kryonaut to replace the old thermal paste. Dropped some good degrees in that process but the same thing still happens.

frdxsf,CthulhuHere,"To the BEAR who didn't kill me at the Generator Room today and even covered me for some time, thank you.","Had a pretty rough beginning to that raid. Entering at 4:30, I learned that the NPSU is priced at 10k for a reason. Then, after quite a bit of fighting scavs, my buddy got stuck in yellow by sewer manhole. Stuck behind a fucken shelf. So, i had to get out alone, without my buddy, and as soon as i pulled the lever, i got shot at from hill. After cooling my heels there for some time, a guy started rushing up. I tossed several nades, we exchanged shots (I had a hunter and an AK-74), none were effective from both sides. Then, thinking that i was already dead, i said ""Back off"" in russian. Several times. Then ""You're on loot"", I was looking to buy my life out. He answered with an ""Opa-na"", and i came out. Only to get shot at from the roof of a nearby building. I thought it was his ambush, but to my surprise, he returned fire. So, after several attempts to convince you to take cover and heal up inside (""Follow me!""- i shouted), i came outside, spammed the bastart with my hunter, and then we took cover back in the safety of the gen room. A short break, a friendly wiggle, and i pulled the lever again, and we ran out. The roof guy was silent, and we made it safely towards the exit of the dorms area. That's where he broke off, i couldn't even say thanks. So i'm doing it here, because after he left, I made it out. All 'cause you decided not to shoot. So, thanks, man.

The screen will be in widescreen, if thats not for you dont try this.

Also my hideout won't load, but my stash and traders work just fine. 

I have tried uninstalling the game with Revo as well as my nvidia drivers with DDU. Starting to wonder if it's tied to my account specifically.

frdqdo,mr_ket,Would it be a good idea to have 2 pmc?,"I was thinking about this because sometimes i die in a short interval between pmc raid and scav raid and it creates a dead time where i have to wait for the cooldown to finish and to heal.
Usually i do a starcraft2 game and it's over but there was a few nights where i was left ""hungry"" because i played so much more starcraft than the new game i acquired 2 weeks ago. It's kind of infuriating and it takes longer to actually get good and have satisfactory raids experience wise.

I understood the hardcore vibe of this game really quickly and i love it but the game is still meant to be played and to have fun with. Would it be a good idea to have two separate pcm operators (bear and usec for example) with 2 different inventories, skills, xp levels and undependant task completion so you can grind for xp as you wish and still have a scav for when you dgaf? There would always be one operator ready to play at any time. I guess the idea is to always use med kits abusively at the beginning but i always get spawn rushed because it makes noise.
I'm only lvl 17 and there's a lot of things i'm not aware of but it does work in sc2 with races and mmr.

Tagging containers is a feature so tagging magazines could be implemented. If people want to strive more for realism, it could be a physical item or service a trader would offer. They could also add magazines with the capability of being color coded but that would only solve a portion of the problem for certain weapons, unless if they made these types of magazines for all types of weapons.

You'll see an open door and everything through the doorframe but the game server will treat it as closed and you can't walk in. You'll see a door closed and an enemy will walk right through or shoot your straight through it. Or you'll close a door that you can't open anymore which forces a teammate to open it for you or wait for an enemy because you're essentially stuck.

Just now on Reserve headed to the K building marked room I see the main entrance door wide open and I shoot the guy inside that was holding the main entrance several times in the face but server side the door is closed - none of my bullets actually connect and then I die to a grenade through a ""closed"" door that I see open.

frau0k,MrRaisinOat,Give more death information!,"I have looked this up and I know that this is not a new suggestion, but it is worth bringing up again and again. New players need more death information. How can we learn without knowing what gun we died to, how far away, silenced or not (useful because sometimes the game glitches and you don't hear the shot even if its not silenced), and the level of the player. This lets players create mental sound profiles better and learn how to better play the game. For instance if a high level player killed you with a sniper at x-hundred meters then you know that the spot you died in is vulnerable to a far off sniper spot. This information could then simply be saved in a match history tab.

We already know who killed us, but that is probably the least important information except to let us know if we died from a pmc or scav. 

Now there are problems that people have mentioned (namely one), but its an easy fix. The problem is that squads will use that information to gain an unfair advantage against the killer. The fix is that you simply don't provide that information to squads until the last person dies or the match ends.

This would be a huge quality of life change for newer players that don't have every possible gun profile memorized and would be pretty easy to implement. The game seems to already know if you are in a squad, and most of these stats are available to the killer so they are saved somewhere and just need to be shared.

I think this is far more valuable of an implementation than a new gun or item and it seems a lot of other people feel the same.",4,1585507372,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/frau0k/give_more_death_information/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I don't want to blame the people doing it, because it perfectly make sense to me since it is one of the best way to make money in EFT. The problem is not the people doing, the problem is that hatchet running is a good method to make money and there is no need to have any gear to make fat stacks of roubles.

fr8bfl,TheHippyDance,Ability to tag magazines. Could enable utilization of blue &amp; white tapes to mark mags for quick visual cues,"**SUGGESTION:**

Would love to be able to tag magazines so I can identify which mag has which ammo. Perhaps utilize the blue and white tapes to wrap around mag as a quick visual cue.

&amp;nbsp;

For Example: mags with white tape have &lt;ammo-type1&gt; and mags without tape have &lt;ammo-type2&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

This would also make the mag selection using [r + mouse wheel] much more useful if I can identify the mag I want.

&amp;nbsp;

Could even give tapes number of uses (e.g., 4 uses per roll)

&amp;nbsp;

**USE CASE/REASON:**

If you're like me and try to run different ammo types for different situations (e.g., m62 and m61), you end up losing track of which mag has which ammo during raids. 

Happens when adding loot to rig or during firefights where I'm not able to pay attention to where mag ends up in rig.

&amp;nbsp;

The only way I can identify mags is to running different mag types, but some guns don't have many mag options. For instance, there's only one 30roung mag type for the M1A. So I can either use the 20round or the 50round for the other type of ammo but must deal with consequences. Visual marker on mag would help greatly and seems like something that would be done in real life",16,1585498439,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fr8bfl/ability_to_tag_magazines_could_enable_utilization/,EscapefromTarkov,1

The only people this doesn't affect are 1. hatchet runners and 2. moslings and others who don't bring gear to the game, thus they have no idea how it feels like being 60+ in the game and being overweight when you loot one other PMC that has even half decent gear on...

I have played this game for over 2 years now, always though things like ""healing animations"" and shit that make the game more tedious to play would ruin it but surprisingly enough they didn't. But this new weight system is retarded as fuck and you can clearly see that in the amount of players that are playing since...

You can't carry anything on you if you come in geared, can barely fill a Berkut out and move anymore. Pretty much everyone that was good at the game has quit the game, when ""realism"" gets in the way of fun then it really isn't fun. Tarkov has become a chore to play where you spend 20 minutes limping to extract from Dorms because you just happend to kill 7 other PMCs there.

And it's even worse for bigger maps, Customs isn't even big and you still take forever to get from half way to extraction.  
When you spend more time in the game limping around and playing inventory than actually playing the game itself, it's not fun anymore. 

If BSG wants the game the stay popular, they need to fix this asap or the game is really going to die.

fr7caz,snek_of_tarkov,GR Breakpoint released a new immersive mode for realism players. Tarkov should get that too. Also some ideas on a realism mode (pouch nerf + real economy + realistic damage and armor),"Ghost Recon Breakpoint just released a new gamemode where players can turn off the loot spiral (a gun is a gun, without levels) and turn the game from arcade shooter into milsim. Why? Because UBI figured out that there is a segment of the playerbase that wants realism, not loot farming.

I think Tarkov should have that too, would be weird if Ubisoft would accomodate for realism players more than Tarkov.

Here is a trailer they released:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB_JQWf83p8

Ghost recon immersive mode features relevant to tarkov:


* Setting to have ANY hit cause a bleeding wound that requires bandaging, means the players is taken out of combat, limping, to bandage. Unline in Tarkov where you hotkey morphine and tank the hitpoints

*The fact that Ubisoft, despite Breakpoint never even being sold as a realistic fps game, managed to accomodate for a part of their players who want hard realism.

* Meanwhile Tarkov was sold as „maximum realism“, but almost all realism has disappeared and the casuals  try to stop any realistic feature or a second gamemode for realism players (people who supported the game early before it was hijacked by loot farmers).


I would like to suggest:

* New gamemode for realism players (pouch nerf + real economy + realistic damage and armor)





==========
Find-economy
==========


Here is how it works:

Think of loot as rain falling from the sky. This rainwater of various composition is harvested by players. A player takes the risk of going in, finding the item and extracting with it. Then he will offer the thing to others on the flea market. The price is going to be:


(cost of the trouble of finding it) + (as much profit as possible)

==========
The cost of finding it
==========

This is all the trouble the seller went through of finding it. His gear cost, ammo, armor repairs, medical costs. That is the break-even point. Then on top of that he will want to maximize his profit.




Let's run a situation. 
The seller found a PK06 collimator. He puts it on the market for 200k. You might think this is too expensive. It used to be sold for 20k. Why on earth would anyone pay 200k for it, ten times the normal price?

==========
How to deal with „overpriced“ things.
==========

There is two types of players when it comes to how to react to the 200k price, not whether to buy it or not. How to „deal“ with it.

* A player who accepts the dynamic of a free market will go „I don't want to pay 200k, I will wait for a better price or find it myself. Or not use one.“ 

* This player is ingame-punishing the seller for his price by not being a customer. For the seller this means, if no one buys it, then he overpriced it and he can take the hint and lower the price or insist on it. The key point here is that this is a free market, where seller and buyer can do what they want and are not forced to play a certain way. 

**Maximum freedom and make due with what you an find, acquire, buy.**



==========
Maximum freedom
==========

If you are in the category of players that think high prices should be limited, then I would like to convince you otherwise. A price is not something static, it is the conversion rate of one thing to another. Because it has been static for all of EFT's existence, many players consider it an unchangeable characteristic.
Please don't try  to institutionally punish the seller by denying him the freedom to set any price he wants. You want it cheaper. It is not a morally justified need to have a pk06 sight. It is something you want, but can survive without. Don't deny the seller the freedom of profiting off the product he risked his PMC life to retrieve.

**„But hey, what if a player just buys up pk06 from others and resells it, how did he risk his life to get it?“**

He bought it up by paying cash for it. And that cash came from somewhere, he had to do wet work on other scavs and pmcs to get that money.


==========
What is price?
==========

A price is a seller and a buyer agreeing on a purchase. If you want to split hairs, there is no buyer or seller, both are selling and buying. The buyer gets the PK06 and the seller gets currency (assuming it was not a barter trade for items).

So if someone buys that PK06 for 200k, then the price was correct. Because a free market is a price finding mechanism that detects the right price for things. However that is only a snapshot of the current economics in EFT. This price can and will shift, often violently. And this is good.


==========
What is value?
==========

The price of something is the value of something in exchange for something else. This is true in real life too. A valuation of anything is always done in pairs. You can buy a car for x money. And even the money itself could be various different currencies. Euros, Dollars, Yen, Australian Dollars.


Now we got that out of the way, you might still think, „What about me? I still want a PK06!“

Good news then! **The market will provide you with a fair price**. Don't believe me? I'll show you:

Note: Fair price does not always mean the price you want.

Loot harvester players will figure out, likely within seconds, that a PK06 is going to sell, because everyone likes it. So they will by busy to **fill that need**. Because that is what a free  market is, sellers trying to find a demand and then supply that demand. **And if they get it right, they get rewarded**.

So, the market will get sell offers for PK06 that keep undercutting each other. The price is going to fall until it stabilizes where buyers want to buy. Now this is important: If this price remains stable for some time, this means a price balance between supply and demand has been reached.

This could be 5k, 50k,  5 toz grips or one scav liver.



==========
Market price is not always the price one wants
==========

Whatever you feel at this point about the price, the free market has determined the correct price for this point in time. If you think it is too expensive, then you are in the minority. But this can change. The point is to accept this reality and make due with not buying it or paying the current price. 


I admit there are still issues. What if after all this, the PK06 is still too rare? Then BSG can increase the spawn rate. They can for example determine that 1% of the playerbase should have access to PK06. (These are randomly chosen numbers for the argument). Whether these are all stacked in one player's stash or evenly divided among 10 does not matter, should not matter and MUST NOT matter.

You may think, that it would be „unfair“ that one player hoards all the PK06, just to drive the price up. I say no. Let him hoard it. Let the item be scarce. Let him overprice it as much as he wants. **Because first, you as a buyer have the power to say no to a price** and second, a player with 10 PK06 sights, will lose 4 of them if he equips them in 5 raids. This is assuming a 20% survival rate. So any hoarded item will eventually trickle out of a player's inventory.

And third, remember that hoarding of all the PK06 sights came at a cost that the guy paid for with money he earned.

And this scarcity percentage of 1% can shift. BSG can have events that change the loot composition like a weather system. But more about this later.

==========
No one wants equal fairness in Tarkov
==========

The game should only be fair on the strategic level, everyone starts with the same opportunities. And the decisions made in stash and in raid will lead to various tactical and economic results. We all play to get an advantage. We all play to get more cash so we can buy better guns than our opponents so we can win easier in the next raid. So there is no room for the argument of fairness and equality. More successful players will have more money and better gear. 


But the ultimate equalizer will always be better tactics. If you get that other player in your crosshairs and your tactics and aim is better at this point in time, you are going to win and take his expensive armor and guns. Plus, even the richest players can only take so much gear into a raid. The highest armor class is 6, and players can not stuff 10 million extra roubles into the armor to increase the armor. Let this thought help you when you are down to basic gear and have to struggle to survive the next raid.

==========
Scarcity creates gameplay
==========

Try to understand that the game should be a constant battle. Everything should be hard and there should always something missing. So you can want something. Only if you access to a small portion of all the possible gear, then there is always something to want. The moment you stop needing something, the game becomes boring. Think about it. 




==========
REAL BARTER
==========


During the economy event, on the third day, M995 ammo became a currency. This was due to the fact that money supply kept increasing and players lost confidence in the stability of value of it. So they want to trade their items for something else that is:

* convertible (it can be traded off quickly for something else and is accepted as payment by most players)

* stable (the purchasing power of the item is somewhat stable)


M995, the most sought after 5.56 round, fulfilled that requirement. On that day, a mosin carbine was sold for 75 M995 and a class 3 helmet for 27 M995.

How cool is this chaos? Items themselves becoming currency. Like ammo is currency in Metro. Not only is it fun, but also necessary to keep the game economy fun. Because with static prices, determined by BSG, the money supply will always outperform the supply of items. Means more and more money gets printed and item prices don't rise with it. So players can buy more and more gear deeper into a new patch and lesser gear becomes useless. This has always happened in every patch. But with a find-economy and no limitations to seller or buyer on pricing or volume of purchase, the game can adjust the prices automatically. As players will start asking for higher prices when the money supply of buyers increases. Do you see how wonderful it is? 

BSG does not have to chase its tail trying to guess the right price. All they have to do is adjust spawn rates. The market will take care of prices, inflation and gear variety.

And they never have to wipe again. Because with the dynamic cloud system, they can slowly dry out the gear economy of high-end guns when they require so. Like for when a new patch comes. Or when there is a massive oversupply caused by unforeseen consequences.

(Of course there will be wipes for technical reasons and major upgrades to gameplay systems but that is beside the point).

==========
Dynamic + Self-adjusting + Wipe-free
==========


All of the above would create an ultra-dynamic, self-adjusting, wipe-free package of fun. 

And as a bonus: Ammo being currency would nerf full-auto fire. Because players are literally shooting money out of their barrels. 


Don's see these shortages as an inconvenience to avoid so you can grind quest and then, when everything is unlocked they „do pvp“. Enjoy the constant shortages in guns, ammo, medicine. Because it keeps you wanting. Wanting something better is the motor that drives the game.


==========
Prestige mode
==========



I understand, this idea does not sound convincing to everyone. The long term fix would be splitting into two difficulty settings. 

The argument against that, which is „playerbase is too small“ is dead. 

* I made the calculation back in April that the game had 50-80k concurrent players. I calculated it from the ratio of viewers vs players from other fps games on twitch. 

* On 0.12 trailer day, there was 14.000 people in the lobby waiting. Just to watch the trailer, 10 minutes before video was available.

* During the first two days, The vievership on twithc was 42.000 viewers on twitch. Before the patch it was 4000.

* Right now, tarkov has 23.000 twitch viewers, compared to COD having 65.000. 

So that argument of „only 2000-6000 players“ is an ancient myth from 2016 where BSG assumed this number of players would be good enough. Tarkov has surpassed that by at least 10-15 fold. Note: I am talking players, not viewers. So there is enough players for various gamemodes. Anyone using „playerbase split is bad“ argument needs to go Overwatch or CSGO and learn how to build a counter-argument that works. Because „„playerbase split = bad“ is as silly as „It's got electrolytes!“


==========
Prestige mode = Permanent Economy event + pouch nerf for those who want it
==========

However,  there is a quick ghetto fix, where no one gets hurt. Think of it as a ghetto event mode.

* Player can choose to lock his PMC into prestige.

* Then his dogtag and name get a special color so others can see he is playing prestige.

Then this mode has the following restrictions:

* FULL pouch nerf. Nothing goes into the pouch in raid. And no guns or ammo or mags allowed to be in at all.

* Shut off traders for prestige players.

* Only make other prestige player offers visible on flea market.

* Only team up with other prestige players (but still in same raids as others)

* Remove scav mode for prestige players. I don't want that free cash button.


===========
One difficulty won't work for everyone.
===========

So there is more than enough players to support two difficulty settings. One difficulty won't work for everyone. And to me it feels like the game is being held hostage by casuals who will do ANYTHING to avoid play PMC under difficult conditions. Not even a pouch nerf was pushed through, or at least a restriction on ammo in the pouch. Means no ammo logistics. Instead we got a magic bag of holding that keeps ammo safe until two seconds before it is in the gun.

Wouldn't it be more fun if every raid was an adventure? Full of scarcity, action and suspense? You can't have that if you go in with gear better than anything you can find, and loot is just stuff to be liqified into cash.",20,1585494748,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fr7caz/gr_breakpoint_released_a_new_immersive_mode_for/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fr6yhv,Flowtche,What level requierement for Labs ?,"Hi Escapers,

I'd like to start online labs. I've been browsing the map offline to know the points of interest, extract areas etc... All this with the raiders activated.

I have 19 million rubles. Some lab keys in my stash. 

What do you think? Can I go?

I made a few raids there this afternoon with varying degrees of success. 

Since everyone uses the penetrating bullet, do you need a helmet? I've seen a few streamers without helmets but I think I'll do like on the other maps and put on a helmet 4. 

Any other advice?

fr66sp,REXnor,Kappa container - more benefits for already strong players,"For the past couple of weeks I have been going pretty hard at the questing in order to get my Kappa container. I am a fairly new Tarkov player, clocked about 300 hours since I bought the game about a month ago. As I'm getting close to the end of the questing, I realize that the Kappa container is not only tedious to get, but quite frankly too hard for most players. What this essentially achieves is granting more benefits to the strongest players in the game. There is no doubt in my mind that I can eventually get to the end of the grind, with thousands of hours in games like Rust etc. and general gaming experience over many years, HOWEVER, I fail to see any reason that the Kappa container should be so extremely difficult to obtain. 

So let's take a look at what the Kappa container actually does, and how it impacts gameplay. The entire purpose of the safe containers is to A) keep valuable items that you bring into a raid safe, such as extra mags/ammo or meds - or B) secure items that you gain during the raid. Now who, might I ask, is it that would need this more? Is it the already stacked, fully geared Chads with 250m roubles lying around, with most of their passive abilities maxed out and fully decked hideouts? Or could it be possible that the newer players, who are already at a major disadvantage with their inability to buy proper gear, no passive skills levelled and no hideout upgrades for passive income? Just look at the amount of hatchet runners, and you got your answer. I personally bought the EOD for the gamma container, just so I could make more money in the beginning when I was struggling.

Now don't get me wrong. I don't think that everyone should automatically get the Kappa container with no effort. All I'm saying is that some of these questlines are quite frankly boring, grindy or simply too hard for the average player - not to mention time consuming. I have been non-stop grinding these quests for days upon days, and I have yet to see the end of it. Honestly, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that most players will never get the Kappa container, with the current quests - partially because it is all reset with each wipe.

So what is my point? I think some of the hardest quests should be removed from the requirements to get the Kappa container, such as Test Drive pt. 1 (too expensive if you're new) and the Shooter Born in Heaven quest (too hard for most new players). Aside from those two, most quests are probably doable for the average player. On a sidenote - many of the ""kill x scavs"" quests become available too late in the quest chains, making them very grindy and tedious as you could have completed them earlier whilst doing other quests. The kill X scavs/PMC quests should be given earlier in the questlines imo.

Keep in mind, these are my personal thoughts on the matter. I'd like to point out that Pestily actually gave up on the rush for the Kappa container on his most recent run because of how grindy it was (specifically levelling certain passive skills to complete quests).

TLDR: The Kappa container is too hard and/or too expensive to get for the average player, while a lot of the quests are tedious and very time consuming. This benefits the players that are already at a major advantage because of high level passive skills/high net worth/high passive income from hideouts. I feel like the Kappa container should be made easier to obtain, for starters by removing two of the harder/more expensive quests from the requirements to start ""the collector"" quest.",5,1585489976,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fr66sp/kappa_container_more_benefits_for_already_strong/,EscapefromTarkov,1

How can you tell if the problem you faced was from someone hacking, server issues, or Tarkov just being Tarkov? For example just today I found what I think was an ai scav that took maybe 50+ rounds of sp 5 to the chest and face and didnt even flinch and managed to drop me after a while.

Another time I was finishing up a raid on interchange and started losing health on all limbs. There were scavs nearby but they weren’t shooting and I took cover from them anyway. I had just run away from a pmc and was worried it was him. No gunshots, no noise. The round that ended up killing me I heard, and it came from a scav. The time from first damage to limbs to death was considerably long, with all limbs taking somewhat equal damage with armour on.

Any explanation to these scenarios?

fr5eoa,Nasstyy,Whats the point of some of these quests - do we really need them?,"Im at about 150 quests done out of all of them, this is my first wipe and im level 43.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of these quests are outright dumb.. and im starting to think there is no point in doing them after you do the most important unlocks and get traders to max. 

Its an insane grind, constant kill x amount of scavs on stupid maps like interchange where at the start you need to avoid people and wait for scavs to spawn.. 

&amp;#x200B;

What they should have done is placed all of these kill x amount of scavs on each map at the beginning of the quest lines, and give us other quests to work on and overtime we can kill these scavs but they do it backwards, at the point where i want to run in with level 6 gear and slay people they ask me to wear a 3M body armour and a respirator and kill 30 scavs.. its tedious and annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a few quests like this:

Shooter Born In heaven - camp certain areas and wait for players (Sit on obvious areas and wait)

Tarkov Shooter Pt 3 - mosin kills on PMCs within 15 meters (Camp factory office and wait)?

Eliminate Killa 100 times - thats just a god damn meme, im not a streamer and dont play 12 hrs a day.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point i know these quests are tedious and i no longer want to progress with them, after reaching a high level and money count i can go out and get into actual PVP fights which are fun and what the game is about. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the quests should be reworked - allowing scav kills to be center of attention for early game and late game it should be about PVP. (early game level 1-30)

&amp;#x200B;

So rant is over and i guess im done doing quests  and no longer perusing Kappa.. it actually makes the game un-fun and frustrating  (It seems they want it to be that way with these quests).",44,1585486157,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fr5eoa/whats_the_point_of_some_of_these_quests_do_we/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fr50al,Gxnjah,Fee on flea market is the biggest bullsh*t ever,"Change my mind.

I accidently sold one m80 bullet for 140k roubles instead of a Dfuel, got a fee of about 900k roubles, why is this bullsh*t allowed?

Even if you DO sold that one bullet, it wouldnt recover a third of the fee price, now I got a hole of almost 1m roubles, and as i'm not into late game and it is my first wipe this is a big deal for me

I get it, it's kinda my fault I've gone too fast and didnt pay attention, but for an immersive game how tf is it supposed to be realistic? Like who tf would pay a million to gain 100k back? And that's the best case scenario cause right now I know I won't sell it

Maybe put some kind of message ""the fee price for this item is bigger than the price you want to sell it, are you sure you want to continue?"" or something like that needs to be consider, cause i'm not gonna lie it kinda f*cked me to the point I don't even want to play anymore today

I just deleted the cache files because of issues logging into the menu after raids, dunno if that could trigger something? No third-party software installed, which modifies the game..

fr2khg,DankAxolotl,[GUIDE] FREE Obrez and get paid doing it!,"# Intro:

Hello,  I am Axolotl, rat extraordinaire! and today I will show you an easy way  to get unlimited Obrez Mosin-Nagant Rifles and GET PAID DOING IT!

Requirements:

* Access to the flea market
* 25,000 Stashed Roubles

# The Obrez:

The Obrez is a short barreled Mosin-Nagant rifle with the stock cut off. It packs a massive punch into a tiny package.

**Pros:**

\+MASSIVE damage

\+Chad Slayer, can kill heavily armored players in a single well placed shot

\+Free

\+7.62x54r

**Cons:**

\-VERY slow rate of fire

\-Low ergo

\-No iron sights

\-Inaccurate

\-Bad

[Use this ammo chart](https://i.redd.it/9yhj1lqzy6541.png)  to look at what to use. Some of these are expensive but if you only  keep a few in your gun and the rest in your secure container it isn't  too pricey to shoot.

**Recommended ammo:**

(I'm not an expert please correct me if I'm wrong

**7N1** \- Can 1 shot to the chest of unarmored people, penetrates very well.

**SNB** \- 2nd best perpetrator in all of Tarkov, 2 shot to thorax but can 1 tap even an Altyn if it doesn't ricochet, **I'd still go for 7N1 in an Obrez though**

# Steps:

1. Purchase a Mosin Infantry Rifle from the flea market for as low as possible. Preferably with front and rear sights but **definitely**  with a 730mm barrel. Inspect it to make sure it has the 730mm barrel  otherwise this will not work. Also get it with a standard stock.
2. Disassemble  the rifles. keep the receivers and the magazines. Then you want to sell  the front and rear sights, barrel, and stock. Check below for math.
3. Purchase 200mm Sawn Off Mosin Barrel and Sawn off regular Mosin rifle stock
4. Put together your Obrez!

# Math:

**Buying:**

Mosin:  20500 RUB. I have found it this cheap before with all the furniture.  Just keep hitting refresh and check for the 730mm barrel

Sawn off 200mm barrel: 2000 RUB. Jaeger LL1 sells it for about this much. Flea market can dip down close too sometimes.

Sawn off standard Mosin stock: 1600 RUB from Jaeger LL1, 2300 RUB from market

TOTAL:  24100 RUB

**Selling:**

730mm Barrel: 20500 RUB after fees. Yes, that is the cost of the original gun. I don't get it either

Front Sight: 500 RUB after fees.

Rear sight: 870 RUB after fees.

Standard stock: 6000 RUB after fees

TOTAL: 27870 RUB

24100 - 27870 = -3770

# GRAND TOTAL: -3770 PER OBREZ

Before this game, we had about 3 other games where we, heard someone, took cover and waited for them and then got killed almost instantly cause they exactly knew were we were at, which is honestly impossible as we were in not so obvious locations. 

On a different match, we respawned at the closest location to Techlight and we literally were attacked by 2 guys 4-5 seconds before we got into the store and both guys were coming from the big hallway to the right, not even from the stairs in front of techlight. 

Like, there is no other respawn closer to Techlight that would get you there 4-5 seconds AFTER us because we have timed it before. We were not able to even loot 1 item inside the store because they instantly threw us grenades and then shot us.

fr1wk2,dcarfa,To the friendly PMC in Customs!,"So with the influx of players recently raids have been sweaty to say the least. Fun but sweaty. Today was particularly rough several PMC runs start and within seconds I get domed by someone. Frustrating but hey its Tarkov I suppose.

During a scav run this evening I spawned in with about 12 min left. Lots of dead scavs and very quiet. So I start looting the shit tier loot to have something to extract with. Mid loot out of nowhere I hear a PMC voice ""HOLD YOUR FIRE"". Initially I was terrified trying to find where it came from, then I saw him peeking in and out of a corner. 

Curious and scared I decide not to fire. We both give eachother the friendly wiggle back and forth and I go up to this PMC. He motions to follow him to another dead PMC and begins to drop some loot for me. Then again the voice command goes off and ""FOLLOW ME. ILL LEAD THE WAY"". He motions me to follow so I do. 

We arrive at dorms and he leads me to the second floor back corner room. He motions behind the door for me to look. To my surprise it is a hidden stocked Attack backpack. He then takes me down the death trail of bodies and we loot the remaining corpses together.

We head down the back stairs and he voices ""THIS IS WHERE WE GO OUR SEPERATE WAYS"" and waves goodbye. We both head in opposite directions to our respective extracts. 

Thank you whoever you are for a fun quick experience that made my night!. It was a nice and very surprising change of pace and will not soon be forgotten!

fr0lkt,Skumper2400,More Noob Questions,"Hey everyone,

Got a new PC and dropped $150 on this game because I've been watching gameplay for months now. Read a bunch of guides, watched a bunch of tutorials, and browsed this sub through the never ending tips people have given. 

I still don't feel comfortable though.

I seem to not be able to hear much when there are enemies around, so I don't really like the close up gameplay. Ran through offline with an SV98 and a scope and I feel like the longer range engagements are my calling (at least vs scavs). 

Other difficult parts I'm having include inventory/stash management with not knowing what is valuable and what isn't, and how to organize properly for what I should keep or sell.

It's also hard to mod any guns I buy. Iron sights are trash and I can't tell what scopes can go where, or what they look like. Which also leads to not being able to kill things in a gunfight because I can't aim.

Also the jump scares....was in factory and a loud pop went off 10m to my side and the bullet went right by my face. My mouse and hand were literally trembling for a good 3 seconds before I could turn and engage back lol. 

I assume most of this can be solved with experience and practice, but anybody have some tips and/or maybe beginner loadouts when it comes to longer range fights? I feel I might be able to pop some heads and be better by playing the sneakier sniper game.

It was so much fun. Killed some Scavs and some player Scavs and ended up dying, but it was so easy going that I loved it. And I got more exp then I normally have doing regular PMC runs.

Normal raid. 

A friend and I finished our looting and decided we were ready to head to extract.

We looked to our left to once again confirm that pier boat was also closed. Only two other options were CCP and Rock Passage. 

Meanwhile, I'm at 10&gt; Hydration with no more water.

We decided to check CCP and then try Rock Passage if CCP was closed too.

Sure enough, CCP is closed. 

Great, with 8 mins left we have to run to Rock Passage.

Slowly, I limp along while dying of thirst.

We arrive at Rock Passage with 3 mins left. 

Closed. 

Nowhere to go.

I'm almost there! 

The predator comes back up behind me, and shoots me once more.

fqyahg,VulkanXVIII18,Just some of my OPINIONS on how to improve Tarkov,"I started playing Tarkov in late November 2019 after having lurked and waited until I had a capable rig to play it for multiple years. I came into Tarkov having a pretty deep understanding of the game and some of its issues, but after 500 hours of game-play I have a few critiques/opinions that I believe would really enhance the experience. (Also, I should say at the start, I adore this game and only want to see it improve).

Player scav game-play is atrocious at the moment. You enter the raid, check your inventory to find no meds and little ammo, but sometimes you find a rare key or expensive barter item just sitting in your duffle at the start. Don't get me wrong, its nice having a lab key-card in my pocket, but it encourages instant hostility to everything the player scav sees throughout the raid since he doesn't want to lose that valuable item. To me, player scavs should be encouraged to work together to survive the invasion of these highly trained PMC's who kill them on sight. However in the current state of the game, there are no incentives to working with another player scav, in fact there are only benefits to killing other player scavs to get whatever rare loot they spawned with. The result is very dry game-play as a scav. In order to fix these issues I believe the following systems could be put in place.

1. Player scavs should no longer spawn with rare keys and barter items.
2. All extracts that require both a PMC and a Scav to successfully extract should be changed to requiring two Scavs who were not on a team before joining the raid. Open successful extraction each player should receive a loot drop as an incentive for working together.
3. A global Karma system that effects all factions should be added to the game. Player scavs would gain karma for extracting with another scav, extracting without killing other scavs, and a small amount should be given passively for time in raid without shooting or killing scavs. Over time, high scav karma would benefit you by providing better random load outs, and better loot drops from double scav extracts. At maximum Karma, player scavs can spawn in with rare keys and barter items. Karma would be lost for killing scavs and player scavs. If your scav karma drops to a certain point, you begin spawning with inferior load-outs. Scavs may begin attacking you on sight. At scav karma's lowest point, you begin the raid hostile to all scavs and can even start tagged and cursed. Violence against Raiders do not cause loss of Karma. In addition, if another player-scav attacks you and you kill him, you will not lose karma and will not aggro scavs. (currently there is an awful risk/reward/risk between player scavs, if I don't shoot, he kills me, if I do, I get his loot and protect my own but all the other scavs are mad at me, this system would eliminate this).
4. Multiple uses of the same player scav. Upon successful extraction, players should be allowed to leave gear on their scav and use them again if desired. Obviously this gear can never be insured. This would be an immersive and fun mechanic to see how long and how badass your random scav can become before he finally gets taken out. Sequential raids could even positively effect your scav karma, as you become a legend among the scavs of Tarkov.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many different factions that are and will be roaming Tarkov. Bears, USEC, Scavs, Raiders, Bosses, and soon Cultists. A dynamic faction system between all these forces would positively benefit game play and immersion. In my eyes, each faction should be hostile to the following opposing forces:

\-PMC's: Hostile to other PMC's (but can work with them), Raiders, Scavs, Bosses, Cultists.

\-Scavs: Hostile to PMC's, Raiders, Cultists.

\-Raiders: Hostile to PMC's, Bosses, Scavs, Cultists.

\-Bosses: Hostile to PMC's, Raiders, Cultists.

AI actually fighting would be engaging and immersive, the maps would feel much more alive and have additional longevity. To further expand and enhance these changes, the following could be added:

1. A bounty system for PVP. This would require two new traders who are sympathetic, or allied to the BEAR or USEC forces. Turning dog tags from either faction to their respective trader would increase that trader's standing with you, or offer loot in return. The BEAR trader should only be available for BEARS and likewise with the USEC trader. A player could be tracked on how many tags they have turned in and a higher reward could be placed on that player's head. This would make choosing which faction you are at the start of the wipe more engaging and help keep the player base around longer.
2. Obviously implementation of faction hostilities would be needed.
3. An entirely new faction could be added to the game, Remnant UNTAR forces. These AI can spawn on every map, they fight and are equipped like Raiders, and have UNTAR armor (maybe a heavier class of this armor could be added as well?) Only one squad of 2-4 would ever spawn and they would roam the map in a group or hold a specific loaction. This faction would be hostile to everything except for PMC's. A PMC can follow the UNTAR squad, or attempt to have the UNTAR squad follow him. Killing the UNTAR as a PMC will reduce your karma with them, and they will eventually attack on sight. Following and fighting with the UNTAR will increase your karma with them. Eventually you will be able to order them with the in game comms. Imagine a lone PMC linking up with a Squad of lightly armored but pretty deadly AI? Karma with UNTAR is linked with trader reputation with Peace-keeper. (This is a crap shoot of an idea I had, I think it would be fun and immersive.)

&amp;#x200B;

Secured Containers. I'm outright against hatchet/pistol running for the sole intention of stuffing items in a gamma. This is exploitative, ruins longevity of raids, ruins immersion, takes away loot from people actually playing the game. Its all around bad. People may argue that that's just their preferred way to play, however they aren't playing Escape From Tarkov, Hatchet runners aren't completing the game play loop, they aren't risking anything, they aren't doing anything but robbing others of entertainment. Jumping on MGL after looting observation tower safes and finding a bit coin and a lion off spawn and killing a PMC actually clearing a building across the map before getting sniped themselves. They win in that situation. They have 300K in their gamma and they lost nothing, and were only in raid for 5 min. Honestly its pathetic, and needs to be fixed. My idea on how to balance secure containers is as follows:

\-Two new items would need to be implemented, Ammo Pouch, and Medical Pouch. These are 1X2 items that can have a 3X3 space inside. They work exactly like a SICC case, or DOCS case. Medical treatment items can be taken in and out of the Med Pouch (No barter items such as LED-X, only functional First Aid). Ammo can be taken in and out of the Ammo Pouch. The cases are small inside so they can't be exploited. Once these are added, an optimal Gamma would look as follows: Med Pouch, Ammo Pouch, SICC/DOC/Key-tool. Any remaining slots can be filled with quest items. Klean has an excellent idea behind implementing quest items in gamma, so refer to that if you want to know more. Other than these cases or quest items, no other items can be put inside.

With these changes, the secured container will operate as intended, a case which allows you to safely store additional medical items, ammunition, quest items, dog tags, money, and other small valuables. Hatchet running would be a thing of the past. And if a part of the player base leaves because of this change, I would argue that they weren't contributing much to the health of the game and the enjoyment of others, so no loss there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, here are a list of various features I think would be cool to see implemented in the future:

\-Weapon mounting/bracing.

\-Rework of shotguns (weapon mounted shell holder for fast reload, realistic spread, double or quad loading, faster animation cancel for shell loading, more exotic shell types).

\-Stripper Clips for mosin/SKS.

\-Stealth prone. (Hold prone key and scroll to make less noise).

\-All armor materials should repair at a similar cost. (TV-100 and slick plate are same material, yet the TV-110 is like 5X more expensive to repair).

\-Certain items need reduced weight to be viable post weight change.

\-Key-bind with animation for quickly dropping your backpack.

Make it so our PMC heals body parts with 1-10 hp first, then the bleeds, then thorax, then the head and afterwards the rest. Same with the Surv12 don't make our pmc heal a broken limb instead make us heal the blacked body part first (stomach then limbs).

I went to the the morgue and saw a geared player, I noped out of there but soon found another geared player near the walls who enclose that zone. I started running away, but I knew was going to die very soon. Then I heard them shouting ""stop there"" and ""freeze"", accepting my fate I stopped and crouched, waiting for the killing shot. Instead, one of them dropped a AK-74N and a Vepr KM and then a paracord. I gave them the filter to make room for the paracord (I'm a trading genius) and thanked them. We went our separate ways but just outside the wall I found a box of 7n39 ammo, so I picked that up, went back and gave it to them. Then I left, and never heard of them anymore. I later died to a player Scav, but at least I had the paracord stuck inside my ass. Thanks to those thicc bois, I felt better and regained some motivation, the next raid I extracted with some kills and good loot after a whole night of losing.

fqvyma,saetama,List of current issues (add if I missed something),"**For visibility here is a list of my known issues:**

1.) Grenades(major):  We shouldn't be getting 1 tapped by grenade shrapnel in the back of the head with a level 4 helmet AND the helmet being 100% durability. The same goes for having level 5 and level 6 armor that are 100% when you get killed by grenade shrapnel in the stomach/chest.

2.) Bitcoin farm glitch(minor): When I click ""Bitcoin farm"" in the hideout the ""Illumination"" Gui pops up. You then have to click  esc and go back into bitcoin farm.

3.) Unable to use items/ Inventory glitch(major): Sometimes when I am taking attachments off of guns the attachment then blinks in my inventory and I am unable to take meds/move items.

4.) Stutters(major): Many theories on what causes these but they have increased significantly over the past 1-2 patches (.12 vanilla was the best so far).

5.) Unable to fire weapon(major): Unsure the initial cause of this but it isn't too prevalent. When I am doing magazine maintenance/reloading a gun AFTERWARDS I am unable to fire my gun no matter what (tried taking magazine out, firing only round in chamber,dropped gun, swapped gun/back etc).

6.) Scav behavior(medium): Scavs will shoot UNARMORED spots of bodies r 80% of the time. Example: My back was to a scav last night as I was serpentine running yet my 2 legs and 1 arm were blacked while my helmet and armor are untouched. I could probably show 100hrs of this happening this wipe and this PATCH it is more prevalent/quicker shooting from the scavs. Scavs will also shoot unreasonably far with shotguns and have less spread than a normal person would.

7.) Cheaters(major): We all know about this and it is not 100% on BSG as battleye has / does ban a fair share of cheats. Here is a cheat I believe that is on BSG though:

## 100% Undetectable RADAR for Escape From Tarkov

**The radar runs on a different PC or inside a  VM so it is impossible for Anti-Cheats to detect it. Anti-Cheats can  only find cheats that run on the same machine.**

**Why undetectable? Very simple! You can run it  on a different PC or inside a VM. Anti-Cheats can only find cheats that  run on the same machine, this one doesnt because it is a packet-based  solution.**

8.) Free look gets stuck(minor): When free looking excessively and at different angles the camera angle gets stuck and you are looking at some crazy angle. This is reset by spamming free look left/right right after it gets stuck.

Just add more onto here and whoops if there is a thread about this already.

**\*\*\*\*\*I AM SENDING THESE IN CHUNKS VIA THE LAUNCHER DAILY\*\*\*\*\***

**Edit adds:**

9.)   Insurance bug(major): Sometimes it doesn't allow you to insure gear, and you have to restart the whole game.

10.) Scavs shoot with limited LOS(medium): Scavs can shoot you instantly with very limited line of sight.

11.) Silent Grenades(medium): Grenades make 0 sound on impact and sometimes 0 sounds when they explode(i believe this is due to a desync with the server).

12.) Walk fast(minor):  If you press jump+sprint at the same exact time when you land you are walking between 30-40% faster until you stop walking or start sprinting.",4,1585440972,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqvyma/list_of_current_issues_add_if_i_missed_something/,EscapefromTarkov,0

fqvs7p,Charaxd,Covering sheet object not rendering causing huge advantage on Interchange,"Hey guys,

first of all I hope this issue has not been posted a dozen of times. Second, I know there are probably a lot of issues with rendering on Interchange or on other maps, yet I think it's necessary to submit such things.

Let me explain the situation and give you a short clip afterwards to explain the issue better.

So my Squad and me are running through IDEA after a 1 and a half minute late spawn (no problem, we kinda got used to it) and move forward up to the EMERCOM medical store. My buddy clears one guy on our (bottom) floor. After a short moment we get caught of by a two or more guys on the upper floor. So we are kinda split and I'm sitting on the RED LED hallway, knowing there is at least one guy on the upper floor in front of Burger Spot. As I noticed the muzzle flash when the guy shot at my buddy, I sneak up to the boxes you can see in the clip, not knowing of the issue I'm about to show you.

So I aim at the guy above, trying to get vision. A few seconds later I just get shot, in the head, from up there. At first I thought someone moved around to TREND or IDEA and shot me from there. After thinking about it a for a bit, I decide to get into Offline Mode to recunstruct the situation for myself and learn from my mistake. That's when I noticed the (at this moment for me game breaking) issue.

https://reddit.com/link/fqvs7p/video/q67uqbpp6ip41/player

So, in the first part of the video, you can see me. Sitting at the boxes on RED LED hallway. Dying. Having no vision whatsoever on the guy above us. Picture 1 in the clip visualizing my sight from below upwards. Picture 2 visualizing my sight from above, downwards. And to make it even more obvious, dropping down from top floor to bottom floor, while viewing the object.

As you can probably notice, the whole tarp (cover sheet above the hallway) is not rendering when looking downwards from the upper floor. Knowing this, you can aim up until the sandbags leading to DINOCLOTHES if you position yourself nicely. Also you have zero problems aiming into that RED LED hallway.

Lessons learned for me, not gonna position myself down there again.

TL;DR:Facing to EMERCOM/DINOCLOTHES downwards from the upper floor on Interchange Burger Spot, the whole tarp (covering sheet) which blocks your vision when facing upwards is not rendering in.

That being said, I wish you the best of luck for your upcoming raids!

Since BSG is already tracking raid stats there should be a leaderboard for each scav run. Most damage dealt, most loot earned, etc. Maybe a top 10 list, obviously not a huge priority but itd be interesting to see.


Maybe even allow successful scav runs to give you an option to keep the scav for the next run, with any gear that you leave him and the same stats, or reroll a new one (after the timer ofc).",0,1585436857,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fquszm/player_scav_system_suggestion/,EscapefromTarkov,0

I find many posts on here liking the weight system, calling for more realism, etc. I believe this is because of bad players that have little FPS ability and are looking for a game like minecraft when this is a competitive shooter that has realistic elements intermixed with looting aspects. 

Please stop complaining, attempting to steer the game in a shitcan direction, and attempt to improve your gameplay. At the end of the day the pixel stacks of money from your hatchet runs are meaningless and you should attempt to improve your skills in gunfights rather than complaining how an experienced player destroyed your camping 5 man at interchange extract. 

Tarkov is not realistic, because it is not based in a realistic environment. The loot items make no sense, hence the weight system makes no sense, hence hatchet running still prevails, and running gear now has little to no reward.",19,1585436489,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqup12/inexperienced_players_need_to_improve_instead_of/,EscapefromTarkov,0

fquh7n,HeyThereHiThereNo,Post game video review / killcam style.,"With all of the talk lately of hackers, and problems with the game having stutters and other things getting people killed, I wonder if this is the time to talk about something like this? 

There are definitely lots of problems, but I also think that there is a good amount of misunderstanding in what happens when someone gets killed in the game. It happens to everyone. 

Whether it is a POV from another player, from your POV or from a free camera in third person it could greatly enhance people’s understanding of what is actually going on and hopefully get rid of some of this instant blame happening.  It would also have to come after a raid is finished, maybe it is uploaded or notified like a flea market sale. 

This could also lead to a system similar to CSGO where veteran players overwatch reported games and can help to filter actual hacking or exploits vs misunderstanding of a situation. 

Probably will get the downvotes but I think it may help with both learning and a more efficient system to detect cheaters.

The leg meta isn’t called meta for nothing, but let’s be honest, most of the time you see the upper part of people, not those sweet tenders

fqtxcp,MtStefan,Epic ecounter with Killa.,"Me and one of my cousins (both under level 15, he is the better one in the duo)  went  on a scav run on interchange. Nothing special prepared, just go to Oli, loot and bounce. We are not so familiar with the map, so we were just wandering around the mall aimlessly when we hear a guy run from behind us. When we look behind we see a guy casually slide out from behind a wall with his gun aimed at us. We just thought he was a PMC/scav player, when we noticed he had the Killa helmet. We quickly shot him down. The strange part is that i had a god damn TOZ (at least my friend had an ak-74) and we took him down in a matter of seconds. It was probably because he was already damaged, his armor was almost destroyed (I dealt 80-something damage to him-with a toz-, probably in the legs as there was no damage absorbed by armor, he was killed in the thorax tho). 

We really couldn't believe it. I was just saying things like ""probably just a guy who has his stuff"" because the fight was so easy, but there it was on the kill feed of my friend (he was the one to kill him) ""Killa""  
I am a stinky rat who has no idea how to shoot, i just like looting things (shame on me, I know) so this whole Killa thing got me very excited. I got his gun and my friend got his other stuff. I was thinking to keep the gun, but I'm not sure that it's such a big deal that it deserves so many slots in my inventory. I keep a lot of things with sentimental value, so it's likely I'll keep it there for awhile",3,1585433903,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqtxcp/epic_ecounter_with_killa/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fqt58m,r4vedave,Any tips for a complete scrub to get scav kills on woods,"Shootout Picnic is singlehandedly turning me away from this game. I'm pretty garbage when it comes to just straight aim battles, as I'm pretty new to the game, only level 14, and Woods is excruciating and is draining the fun out of the game for me.

All I need is a final 2 kills, but it seems that no matter what I do, or where I go, I get brained within about 5 minutes. If I try running through cover on the edges of the map, I run into geared squads. If I try directly sprinting from spawn towards scav spawns, I get brained while out on the open. If I try sitting in a bush for about 10 minutes, once I start moving I get brained by a sniper who's seemingly already set up.

I know for the most part the answer is simply ""git gud"" but making progress is infuriating when I have to sink 40k on a kit for usually only a single scav kill before I'm dead.

I need some pointers, or something to help me deal with the frustration.",4,1585431429,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqt58m/any_tips_for_a_complete_scrub_to_get_scav_kills/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fqseim,blackwolfLT7,whats up with reserve lately?,"Alright, so for good week or so i am starting to see weird patterns in reserve.

For example, month ago or so i almost would never find anyone extract camping cliff descent...nowadays it is like atleast 1/3 - 1/4 games. They do it in the grass, they do it behind doors with shotguns, they are doing it through the glass, they do it behind some rocks; then they are getting original and even camp the roof now. And they even do it groups. You never know. Sometimes its scavs, sometimes PMC's.

But there is also increase in people camping knight garages (rb-st), and underground, manhole too; places where i havent seen it as much. 

Atleast there are less dome snipers.

Then you have hatchlings who run in.... duos? Then you have hatchling duos who often kill themselves with grenades, usually in drop down rooms. Or the underground.

The lever is often switched  in like first 3-5minutes or so. Used to be atleast good 15-10minutes before.

And pmcs now try to bait you into traps spamming commands like  ""hold your fire"" and waiting you to do the same or just instantly opening fire when they can. Then on their bodies who find like 3+dogtags and weapon collection. You can trust no body.

People in this game most of the times where arseholes but this last week is even weird by tarkov standarts.... anyone have any ideas, why though?",22,1585429071,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqseim/whats_up_with_reserve_lately/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fqs0c5,soVeryMuchAnonymous,You made me do it BSG!,"So I am a pretty bad, below average player in this game (20% SR, 1.8 KDA). But for some reason I still enjoy it.

But enjoyment was only there when I had maxed strength and endurance (yes from glitch)

But no, the fact that I had that small advantage over others didn't really help me. I still died often and it was still a frustrating experience sometimes. But at least I didn't feel like a disabled person every second of the game breathing heavily after running for 10 seconds. That is just stupid and I don't how anyone can be ok with that game mechanic. All other stuff in this game is ""OK."", but that part just makes it unplayable, annoying and boring.

After it got patched, I couldn't play the game anymore. I tried.. It was unplayable IMO, I would spawn start running towards a location, but only few seconds after, I couldn't run anymore. That is not realism, that is just making the game not fun and more annoying &amp; frustrating than it has to be.

I didn't play for a few days, but Tarkov was always in the back of my head. God I wish I could play the game ""normally"" again. It was amazing how you go ahead and fix those kind of glitches  and exploits instantly, but the stutter, shitty netcode, poor optimization, random FPS drops are here for a long time (I know its not the same, and its not as easy to fix, but I'm just making a point here)

Anyways to end the story. I've tried playing the game again and it was straight up not fun. I was too bad. I wished that at least I could run normally and that BSG didn't take away my endurance/strength. So guess what I decided to do, I bought cheats. I bought cheats and I am ruining every fucking game now for so many people. I am ruining so much more games than I ever was with my strength/endurance maxed out. And as pathetic as it is, I don't care. I blame you and your retarded game design. I'll spam game after game. Wipe the server, take the loot. I've already earned enough rubles to sell it and earn back my money that I've paid for the game and for the cheat. I'm just waiting for my ban, but until then. Go to hell with your stupid weight system.

Also just so you know, players of EFT, there are so many more cheaters in this game than you think. At least 1 per game (not lying/over exaggerating) . I know because I can see speedhackers through ESP. Instead of fixing exploits that don't really hurt the game or affect it very little, ban the cheaters (like myself) who actually completely ruin the game.

TL;DR pt.1 You took away my elite strength/endurance, so I bought cheats.

TL;DR pt.2 I wasn't good enough, so I needed cheats.

TL;DR pt.3 The weight system is terrible and produced many more cheaters than there ever was.",33,1585427823,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqs0c5/you_made_me_do_it_bsg/,EscapefromTarkov,0

&amp;#x200B;

I could see this not being allowed, but I am not sure. My mistake can make you a quick 200k on top of the cheapest RR price. I mistakenly listed mine for 6,399,111, when I wanted to list it for 6,199,111. It cost my 2mil to list (I just unlocked Jaeger III so I did the trade looking to make a 300k profit. I see my terrible mistake now).

It will almost certainly not sell at this price, so if someone is willing to purchase it at 6.4 I will buy a facemask from you for 400k. This way you get a 200k discounted RR and I only toss away my profits and not 2mil of a listing fee. I know there is no way to insure I won't be an asshat and not buy your trade, but I figure I would give it a  shot. My game name is ""shadovolov"" and my flea rank is like 19.51.

At level 1 all traders, I’m stuck to PS 7.62 and 5.45 ammo in a SKS, AK74, or Vepr. I can’t use scopes, mags above 10 rounds for the 7.62 weapons or get decent armor (fence sells a bunch of broken armor). At least improve what the traders are selling if you’re going to lock it to lvl 15. Occasionally I can pick up a nice gun (got a juiced AK74 yesterday which I immediately lost), but it’s hit or miss and it’s tough to get the willpower to actually use it. Plus, the learning curve for me at least is tough and learning Customs (the map I’m focusing on) is tough. So in conclusion I would either fix traders or make the flea market lower.

Was I doing something wrong here? Or did I just get screwed by a bug.

fqri9b,DrRocksos,Passive skills: What could be improved? My idea.,"Hello everyone!


With the recent patch the passive skill system is really starting to show it's weaknesses, so I got to thinking about how this system could change, and what could be better about it. 


Personally, I think the 'passive skills' should just be a straight up unlock. 


The way to unlock them? Do that thing. You wanna unlock the run faster skill? Better start running. Recoil with Auto Rifles? Shoot mother fucker, SHOOT! This mirrors what's currently in Tarkov at the moment, and it's sweet so why change it?


As you do these things, you fill a progress bar. Once you've run enough/carried enough heavy shit/shot enough with a certain gun and the bar is full, you should just 'unlock' the skill. Period. Each skill could affect a stat by a static amount, so for example 'attention' would affect search speed by 20% flat if you have it equipped. 


Once you've unlocked a skill, it can be selected via the 'skills' tab on the character sheet. Up to 3-5 skills (depending on level, so this way higher level player are still rewarded) can be 'active' before you enter a raid, and you have to pick which ones you want. The point is to limit the amount of skills that can be 'active' at one time. So for instance, if you want to just full PvP with PMC's, you pick the 'less recoil', 'run faster', 'more stamina', and 'More Health' skills. Or for instance, if you just want to loot run, you pick the 'carry more', 'run faster', and 'loot quicker' skills. Of course, with all the skills currently in the game, people would value certain things over others. So everyone will take different stuff.


I think for this to happen, the 'zero' of all skills in the game.. so like.. if you are at 0 points in all skills, you move X fast. That X is the zero of the skill. So that X would need to be bumped about 10-15% I think. So everyone, from 'zero', would run 10% faster, loot 10% faster, etc. Because people will only be able to take say.. 5 skills, when before they could just have every skill. So you would have to bump that 'zero' number to keep the game feeling fast.


The downside here, is that this makes Tarkov a bit less immersive, in my opinion. It moves Tarkov a bit closer to CoD territory.. which.. I do not like.


I think this is a pretty good happy medium between what we have now, and the vision that BSG wants for this game. What do you all think?",3,1585426236,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqri9b/passive_skills_what_could_be_improved_my_idea/,EscapefromTarkov,0

fqr9lg,SOMELIMES123,Weird fee prices in the flea market,"So I was selling stuff on the flea market and accidentally listed 8 pieces of ammo for 92000 a piece. I took the offer down but noticed that more than a million roubles have been taken from me. I then looked at the fee for the ammo I put up and it was more than 1,520,000. This fee makes no sense as the most profit you could make from selling each piece of ammo would be 736000, which is much lower than the fee. I attached a screenshot.

The losers.   The scum.  You sit in your little room and you wait don't you.  You're gun up, giggling away to yourself.  

That side room in Spa near one of the major entrances.  The vehicle rooms on Reserve.  The area around Kiba on Interchange.  The safe room in Factory.  Big Red or the bathrooms on the 3rd floor of Customs.

You love to sit there in your shadows with the knowledge that most will walk right by you, and you pounce.  Drooling over my body within seconds like the hunchbacks you are which is why your parents cast you in to their dark, dank basement to leave you as a virgin for the rest of your days.

In the first scope (Holo) you see my normal ads sensitivity I use. Everythigns fine.

In the second scope (Sniper scope) you see my normal sensitivity in sniper scopes. Everything fine here too.

In the last scope (the integrated holo scope on top of the sniper scope) my sensitivity is WAAAAAY slower than my normal holo scope sens. In a gunfight situation, this is a big handicap.

Does someone knew how to get the same ads sensitivity in these integrated holo scopes as my normal holo ads sens?

I think many of us would readily agree that invasive programs that steal gear off of a player would be cheating. I also see hate for the speed runners and auto aimers. 

But what about tools such as digital sound display for the hard of hearing? 
https://rog.asus.com/technology/rog-sound-innovations/sonic-radar/

When used in Tarkov it shows where people are walking or shooting from. This is a program built into the new Asus hardware. Is it cheating? 

Or how about reshading? Surely if you think the sound compass above is wrong, then altering the game through a third party program would also be cheating. Right? 

Where do you draw the line? Is using discord for team communication wrong? BSG has stated they want to introduce VoIP, are we ruining the true experience by using another 3rd party app? 

Is it cheating when one person can do it but another cannot? Is it cheating if it gives one player an advantage over others? Is it cheating if you have to pay for it?

Bar the entire playerbase from a map because the hackers have taken it over. What a great solution. How about we start actually taking down all the discords with hundreds of users that are selling tarkov money? That's a good start.

What is being done? Because obviously Battleye isn't doing jack shit. One wave every 4 months is NOT worth dealing with every other lobby having a cheater for 4 months. I'm literally at the end of my rope with this game.

Just because you don't see them, doesn't mean they aren't there. So there's probably even MORE than what I see in my daily games.

fqnxxz,icanloveyouAMA,Killa gains! I made a simple Google Sheet to encourage you to exercise after raids during this time of quarantine.,"Hey all,

I figured since we are going to be locked indoors for awhile, I would make a little (albeit very simple) spreadsheet to encourage some movement during these times where movement may seem... unappealing.

Here is the shareable link to the spreadsheet, in order to edit it; **you have to make a copy!**

[Killa Gains B)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UPggaGChXYCPgv_1NxpGniaeuk4V5X8hs8m_XalvBj4/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the rundown of what each action in game will result in.

Each **SCAV** kill = **2 pushups**

Each **PMC** kill = **5 pushups**

Did you survive the raid? **yes** = **1 60 second plank**     **no** = **2 60 second planks**

&amp;#x200B;

If you want and have easy access to a treadmill or it's nice outside, you could substitute the planks for 5 minutes of running at a 5.0 mph pace (or whatever you like, of course).

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this sees some use, stay safe and indoors playing EFT!",4,1585414900,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqnxxz/killa_gains_i_made_a_simple_google_sheet_to/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I'm lvl 20, 16 million ruble stash worth(not including RR), another 10 mil spent on hideout upgrades prolly.

my survival rate is 31%, but probabaly closer to 50% as of late now that I know maps pretty well. 

With the exception of interchange. 
I know the basic layout of the map and where to go, but I don't know what it is about that map, I ALWAYS get killed. I've done probabaly close to 20 raids there, I've only ever survived once, and it was a run though.
EVERY time I die it's ether to someone camping a dark corner, running across a 3+ Chad squad that just gets the drop on me, or shitty game mechanics. 
Last night I dumped half a mag of 7.62 BP though the glass from the inside of kiba at a guy outside, guy one taps me to the head through the glass. After action report showed I did NO damage to him (meaning not a single round went though the glass). I get killed by shitty mechanics like that on interchange more than any other map. 
I don't know if this map is just cursed for me or what. Even when I run with friends that love interchange, we all end up dying whenever im squaded up with them lmao. 
While learning a map my survival rate is around 25-30%
After I know a map pretty well the survival rate goes up to at least 50%.
Prolly around 70% for customs, 50% for reserve, 50% for shoreline. 

Any interchange pros have any tips for what I could be doing wrong on this map?!

Last night I was running around Shoreline with my buddy doing a lazy loot/scav killing run and as we moved through the forest continually stopping for cover and checking our angles seeing the sun come up and shine through the trees I realized as I have previously that this game is something unlike any other game I’ve ever played. As someone with terrible anxiety and a 1 year old a global pandemic could be a little stressful but this game has given me the chance to put these things on the back burner for a couple hours every night and I couldn’t be more thankful. I’ve been desynced and stuttered and been killed or dumped from servers losing loot. I’ve had weird bugs where I can’t remove my weapon or insure anything.

It would make my day if I could get my hands on this game. My friends probably would be surprised and excited as well, because they have asked me if i'll get the game.

fqksik,Sr_Sublime,Killed by haker using explotions,"spanish dude here, sorry if i miss spell something.

Okey, so i was trying to do the mission fishing gear on shoreline in night time, and just when the raid started i heared some explotions, alot, i thinked for my self, wow, what amazing pvp they mus be doing, but i keeped hearing them in a relly fast and continuated way, so i thought, well just someone training the stength soft skill with granades... but the sound came from relly diferenciated placed... like far from each other... that was just around the first minute of the raid. Sudently i get claped with an explotion that broked my leg and caused me tremors, but didnt killed me , followed by other explotion that killed me. 

Then in the information screen, i was just killed in action... yeah right, no name... i think they are using mines, so their names dont show up, and fit the way they kill you. my best guess is that they spawn them in your feet, coz there is no sound before the explotion, no granade hiting the ground, no granade launcher shoting, nothing, just explotions.

i just took a screenshot of the killed in action screen and forgot to take from the injurys km travelled etc, my bad.

I dont care to be killed, one more one less but i hope this info can be used to track down cheating methods and make EFT the ideal place were you only die by your own incompetence or the skill of an adventajated player.",7,1585404389,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqksik/killed_by_haker_using_explotions/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fqkp2x,Oeconomia767,Figuring out why there is fps drop every 8 seconds (exactly!),"So as the title says when I am in the traders screen it seems that every 8 seconds there is like a micro stutter - I've measured it to the second and it recurring problem.

I also think it might have an affect on other parts of the game because this kind of stutter happens in game.

My spec:
Intel i7 6700
16GB
Nvidia 2070 super
windows 10

When monitoring the issue with task manager it seems there is not increase in activity - not increase in ram, cpu, network or graphics usage.

I have tried the following common fixes with no luck:
- Full screen and borderless
- Changes graphics settings in game
- Disable full screen optimizations
- Disable hyper threading
- Set DPI to application
- Updated to latest drivers / windows version
- Removed geforce experience
- Disable power management
- Disable High Precision Event Timer in bios and in windows

Do you guys know any more possible fixes to try?

It seems, as far as I can see, that if you carry a wallet or rubles on your character and spend money out of raid, the sum is deducted first from your character rather than your stash. This means that if you're someone who likes to carry money for the paid extracts, you have to check your wallet before every raid.


I can't really think of why it wouldn't be preferable for the game to prioritise taking money from your stash before your character.

fqge74,Deletd_EFT,The Skill System needs a complete rework,"If BSG seriously wants to stop people from exploiting skills like endurance, strength, health and the such, they need to rework them entirely.

Now to their credit, they did make getting strength a bit easier by lowering the amount you need to carry, so that was a good move, but they also reset a lot of people, twice. Once for everyone and twice for the people that exploited them.

But the thing is, people wouldn't exploit them as much if they A: Didn't give such a massive advantage, and B: If they weren't so unreasonably hard to level up. It's a lot like the old recoil control cheesing. It was pretty damn important as max skill meant your guns would be lasers. If i remember correctly this was changed though, so credit to BSG for that too.

But really though, how can BSG expect cheesing to stop with the current skills? Max endurance means being able to run from switch to bunker in little over 1 bar of stamina with gear. Max strength means being able to move way easier and throw way harder. These advantages coupled with getting them being hard gives people more incentive to exploit them.

Now how would i start fixing them? I would start by making leveling them easier. Maybe adding a module to the hideout allowing you to level them when not in raid to compliment the change. Then i would reduce the advantages, or if that would be too harsh, i would increase the default stamina and strength to be closer to max.

Also considering recoil, i am not very in the loop with how it works right now. If someone knows better, please do correct me. But if i had to change recoil control skills, i would make the skill only work on horizontal recoil and aim reset time, leaving vertical recoil to the player. Then i would also reduce the vertical recoil on some guns like 7.62 AK:s and the such. Only by a little bit though.

If you have any ideas of your own, please do share them! It is always appreciated.",27,1585384979,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqge74/the_skill_system_needs_a_complete_rework/,EscapefromTarkov,1

It's done a ton to open up the map. Suddenly, whole new pathways exist that dramatically alter player wayfinding.

Now, I'm not advocating putting a hole every ten feet. But imagine if there were openings between previously blocked off areas that were randomly open just for that ""spawn"" of the map, in the same way some extraction areas are randomly active or not. 

I think it would add a lot of dynamism to one of the most static portions of the game.",1,1585376186,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqeq0j/map_rng/,EscapefromTarkov,1
fqepin,likethesearchengine,We need an after-game killcam,"... and a report button. Today, I was killed by a mosin scav that was clearly using a radar hack. Situation: Trying to complete the Therapist 3M exterminator quest. I go up the stairs to techlight with 8 minutes left in the raid, and find that Ultra is not looted. I go in, shut the door behind me, and find a syringe (hooray) as the best piece of loot. I am creep-crouching the entire time I am in there. 

Suddenly, I hear clanging on the escalator. I freeze and point my VSS at the door. I hear crunching as the dude loots techlight for the umpteenth time this raid, and then I hear softer clanging on the escalator as someone else comes up. I'm worried it is a duo of PMCs doing something like what I am doing, until the second guy one-taps the first guy. it sounded like he died near the register, so perfect - I'll wait until he goes over to loot and then open the door and wax him. 

Well, I hear a little crunching from the second guy, but he never moves away from the escalator. I wait, wait, wait. He never makes another sound. I wait until I worry that I will be late to extract if I don't move out.

Four options: 

1) He low-profile crept back down the escalator. 
2) He low-profile crept over to loot his kill (and maybe left, it has been minutes). 
3) He is waiting over there because he is the most cautious player ever and doesn't care about the loot or extracting on time.
4) He knows I am there.

I discount #4 as a real option. I have made little to no noise, and the techlight alarm is loud. I could BARELY hear him coming up the escalator at a medium walk with Sordins and sitting still. 

So, I open the door and peer. I move up a little, and see legs sticking out near the register. I get up and go to see if it is the body or the second guy, and get one tapped from the same guy who is still sitting over by the escalator in the shadows. He might have had enough time to loot me and extract, I'm not sure. 

I refuse to believe it was anything but an esp-like hack, until I see a killcam where he detected me legitmately. It Makes me want to quit the game. And I can't report a randomly generated scav name.",4,1585376114,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqepin/we_need_an_aftergame_killcam/,EscapefromTarkov,1

All scavs would spawn with respirators and plague doctor masks and maybe even an early implementation of the **Cultists**   and maybe even a broken implementation of the biohazard stat.

Theres definitely alot to be brainstormed for the pre-wipe event (however long away that might be) but I definitely see a pre-wipe event like that making it to gaming community blogs like kotaku if it were done properly.

fqe479,ttvvcheck,Official Clans/Teams/Squads in EFT?,"What do you guys think about there being an eventual team or clan system in EFT? 

In addition to the player hideout, you could work together with a set amount of people to upgrade a team hideout with different craftable items and specializations. Certain team members could specialize in medical crafting, others in ammo or lavatory related item(s), increasing crafting efficiency (less mats, faster craft times, etc).

Additionally, perhaps customizable arm bands with a team logo of some sort could be added. I think adding more incentive to play with friends could result in a lot of fun for everyone, even people who typically play solo only.

Some other ideas:

1) Leaderboards for squads/solos. (Squads: Average kd of everyone on the team, total kills, etc).

2) Squad stashes, where you can drop off some loot for your friends to use if they want. Additionally, this makes returning gear to your friends easier than the current basic method (loot and drop in next raid).

3) Squad specific missions/quests. One example could be hitting the hermetic door on Reserve for a friend  to extract within 30 seconds.

Been playing a couple weeks, and my experience so far has been pretty horrifying, just want to see if these are normal occurrences that other people experience as well? 

1. Teleporting Scavs (or scavs spawning virtually on top of you)
2. Invisible players (played with a friend he couldnt see or hear me at all)
3. Dying for no reason (no gunshot sounds or impacts but take damage/die)
4. Scavs one shotting you from across the map while hidden behind objects
5. Players rubberbanding constantly as they run around making it nearly impossible to shoot them
6. Scavs spawning seemingly endlessly and knowing exactly where you are despite having no LOS (I piled 6 scav corpses up in a doorway on reserve once)
7. Cant group with players or invite (inviting works randomly, sometimes only shows 1 in the group even after invites accepted, have to leave and rejoin and try inviting 3-4 times per match)

Just curious if it may be my computer or just a horrifying scam of a ""game"" before I initiate a refund/chargeback with my bank or upgrade my PC.

Number 2: Forget rule number 1, He ALWAYS have MORE than 1 friend.                            
Number 3: Always relocate after each kill, even if that mean run as fast as possible and create a lot of noise, since it could cause confusion to enemy squad.

fqarup,FapForYourLife,How EFT has helped me in the age of COVID-19,"I first started playing tarkov just as coronavirus was becoming a serious issue. At first I was excited that I’d have so much free time to play and get better at the game. As I’ve played, I’ve come to realize just how much this game applies to real life. 

You go into every raid just wanting to get by and survive with the gear you entered with. This is the equivalent of waking up every morning and just going through the day hoping things will get better. You quickly learn that this usually doesn’t happen because you’ll meet unfortunate circumstances like better geared players and poor luck. The only way forward is to sacrifice what you have in order to improve. 

This is difficult because you think “well I have this AKS-74u, why not just hold on to it forever?” as if that’s all you’re capable of achieving. It isn’t until you use that baby AK (or the fifth one you buy because you keep dying) to drop a chad with an M4 that you realize what you’re capable of. You decide to keep going. 

You’ll lose that M4 on the first raid you use it in, and that’s a good thing. Because you realize that your value does not lie in your items, it lies in your capability, which is something you can keep improving. 

You think about the times you’ve died. You see what you did wrong and you actively avoid doing those things. 

You die less, but you still die a lot. You soon realize that we all die a lot. We are constantly tricking each other into dying, all the while teaching each other to get better and die less. 

Several times throughout this process you will think  about giving up, we all do. It’s hard and it sucks sometimes. But we all keep going, although not for the reasons many of us believe. We all keep going because we are helping each other get better. Every death is encouragement to learn, adapt, and kill to teach another PMC. 

We do not live in easy times, and tarkov reminds us of this. We fight for ourselves, and for each other. We challenge each other to constantly strive to be better. We realize that our jobs are not what define our capabilities. We persevere in the face of abysmal odds because we know that WHAT THE FUCK HOW COULD HE EVEN SEE ME ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING",6,1585359638,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqarup/how_eft_has_helped_me_in_the_age_of_covid19/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I bought the key literally 30 mins ago for 59,999. I thought ""kinda expensive for a quest key"" but didn't think too much of it. I noticed there were only like 8 or 9 listings anyway, so I just got it.

Completed the mission, went back to sell it on the flea market and the lowest price is now a whopping 180,000. In literally 30 mins. Lots of listings. I have no idea what happens. Part of me thinks someone with lots of cash just bought all the keys and relisted them with jacked prices. Cos there were only 8/9.

fqa8re,Ranoutofcharact7878,Shoreline SNORELINE. The impossible task of 3 PMC headshots from 100m.,"It is getting ridiculous. I spent multiple raids on interchange a few days ago and got no luck on having people to kill from the required distance. I went to every spot people recommended and gave up after looking around, running around and also sitting for hours.

Now I have done 8 or so raids on SNORELINE, and nobody goes to ANY place but resort anymore, and quite frankly its impossible to get a 100m kill in the joint. I see nobody go to cottages, pier, or anywhere else. Gunshots at the start of the game at resort then the rest of the game its quiet. Nobody extracts on this map apparently, I have watched paths that people would have to cross to get to the extracts and nobody comes. I leave AI alive so I can hear if they get aggro'd from someone. 20 minutes into the game I now realize everyone is probably dead to one guy who went rock passage after killing 5 hatchlings and got himself a nice Grach sidearm from another guy.

**The whole ledx shit needs to be spread to the other places on the map. Cottages, pier (add a door that needs a key for that building). Why is it so EASY to get millions worth of loot with nothing on the line?**

May as well rename Shoreline to Resort because the rest of the map is not utilized at all simply due to the 1.5m and 30m roubles chance in the rooms. Every other landmark on the map has garbage loot. Yea you might get a bitcoin or graphics card in the cottage or radar, but apart from that's its all trash you might need for a quest at level 5. This is why nobody desires to go to these places.

**It cannot be difficult to add more scavs to the Resort for now until the boss and raiders are brought in. Please do that.** 

One thing you notice about Reserve and Customs is that the bosses/raiders make the game feel alive because the players definitely don't in almost every case. It gives more stuff to do and a random ""hotspot"" every game for guaranteed PVP.",21,1585357720,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fqa8re/shoreline_snoreline_the_impossible_task_of_3_pmc/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I don't really care about dying, what frustrates me is the fact, that I pumped almost a whole mag into that dude and he is still alive. 

First game I we spawned, got into a fight straight away. The guy comes rushing in, I start full auto and well he turns and kills me. I think hmm unlucky I thought those bullets hit. Then in the end screen I get a hit count of 48. That is into one single PMC. No matter what that dude is wearing (as if it would matter anyways with 995) he should be dead. Well the other two raids was 29 and 36 hits on one PMC.

Next problem is, it happens with SCAVs aswell. And I mean with AI SCAVS. like if the server registers the hit, but the bullet does no damage. In the damage calculation you can still see the damage though. We went to Reserve again and well tried high damage bolt action. So Mosin it was. And startet shooting Scavs. Some would die others would just tank 4-8 bullets. After 3 Scavs we decided to get killed to have a look at what the damage and hit count was. So 1 Scav kill and I shot at 3 scavs. totaling 1143 damage. But 7N1 on a usual Scav should just kill him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is anyone else experiencing these issues? What is going on here. It would help to understand what is happening. With players it could be desynchronisation, but with still standing Scavs?!?!",17,1585351938,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq8kiz/problem_with_hits_not_making_damage/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I managed to get into the breach room &amp; placed 2 of the 3 gunpowder before some guy threw in a grenade and killed both me and my friend. 

However when I get back to the breach room I'm now unable to place the third gunpowder. I've tried multiple different gunpowders, tried dropping on the floor &amp; picking up &amp; moving around in inventory ect...

I'm always going in at night, before anyone suggests that. And for info, I've mostly been hatchet running it to try to complete, but have tried with a rig &amp; still no dice.

Decided to pick one up last night and absolutely smashed factory for a good 20 raids with all of them (but like 3) resulting in a lot of juiced loot and kills. It was extremely easy, the thing is a laser with a RK-2 and i even pierced an altyn in one shot.

fq6vo5,TheAnonymous77,A concept of INFILS.,"So we have EXFILS (Extracts), but we don't have INFILS (Infiltration points) where we actually enter the map, it's completely random and unrealistic. It is maybe too OP but what if we can choose where to enter the map, in real life you would have the option to choose where to enter an area so why don't we have that here too?

Basically you and your team choose a point before clicking ready and you will spawn there, you don't know where others spawn, you only know that nobody is spawning at your INFIL.

For example in reserve you could have bunker hermetic door, hole in the fence, cp fence, cliff AScend as an INFIL and the only rule is that you can't EXFIL where you INFILed.

fq5ymo,AftT3Rmath,I think i'm done,"Can someone please explain to me what the point of bringing in gear is now. Whats the point of the heavy, expensive armor, the heavy, expensive guns. You can't sustain that playstyle because you can't make money with that gear. ""You shouldn't being able to be a bullet sponge and still be able to carry anything."" Ok, well how do you expect me to be able to repair my armor, refill my ammunition, heal my character, if I can barely carry anything out to supplement the income I lost.

This game, when I bought it, was a Risk vs. Reward game, based on realism. Its still based on realism and has a lot of realistic shit in it. But the Risk vs. Reward element is so skewed in the favor of hatchetlings or people with budget guns like hunter veprs and mosins. There is literally no point in running through interchange and fighting people and looting the mall because when your done, and you pop your SJ1 Stim and start making it to extract at a speed comparable to a grandma with osteoporosis, people waiting at an extract, jerking off and watching youtube, have no issue alt tabbing and shooting you from wherever the fuck their hiding. The whole downside to extract camping, used to be, that you waited an entire play session and sometimes people wouldn't show up, or they would get away, or they would shoot you. Now, they just have to worry about you not showing up.

Hackers, stutters, glitches, etc. Thats just the cherry on top, why would I play an unstable game thats balanced towards every other playstyle except my own time and time again. Making money is impossible because ammo is expensive as fuck, gear is expensive as fuck, everything fun to use that isn't a budget gun is expensive as fuck and is not worth using because the downsides to using that gear far outweigh the benefits to using that gear. Not only do you have to consider you max speed debuff, the stupid sensitivity changes the game makes based on what armor you wear, the ergonomics penalties, and the cost of your armor, you have to also consider how much money your allowed to make in a run because you've once you've hit that weight cap, your not moving very far, or very fast, oh and your PMC also develops asthma every 50 feet, fun I know.

Sure, I could make a meta M4 built for recoil or ergo, bring a couple nades, spare mags, chunky armor to protect myself. But why, why would I spend 500k on a kit with a gun that costs 1000 roubles a shot to fire, when I could just bring a hunter, hide like a bitch at an extract and wait for my overweight kin to show up so I can blow there brains out while their immobile ass's can't do shit to stop me. Its far more rewarding and profitable to do than playing the game the fun and skillful way, and a hunter vepr only cost like... 40k? Thats fucking nothing, and if they kill me? They get nothing, and I get my gun back in insurance.

I've been on both sides of the coin, and I see how the game is balanced, and its not balanced for people playing the game as its designed, risk and reward is so skewed in the current state of the game. Its not worth my time. Its been fun killing you guys and taking your shit. Bye.",76,1585343766,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq5ymo/i_think_im_done/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fq5q2e,RealParallax,"Raiders / Gluhar + Guards / Labs, what’s the point?","So what’s the point of these things being in the game? Especially things like 6SH raid backpack. If you wipe Gluhar and his guards, you can’t fully loot them. Same with killing even a few raiders on labs, if you end up killing one or two players on labs you’re going to be overweight assuming you actually brought gear into labs. 

I’m still stuck on the idea that the weight system negatively affected PVP, buffed hatchet running and extract campers, and makes it harder to enjoy the basis of Tarkov, which is being a Looter Shooter game. 

I can’t be the only one feeling this, right? Any time I speak up about this I just get shut down by people saying “it’s realistic”, “in real life you couldn’t carry 55kg and run and aim” and everything you could imagine but at the end of the day it’s a video game. You have to sacrifice realism for fun at some point and personally this crosses the line. Realism is nice and all but what about Vaseline or broken legs being insta healed by a splint? There’s so much in this game that isn’t realistic and I feel a weight system in a LOOTER game was a terrible decision. Especially with debuffs occurring at 40kg.

These are my results of 100 70,000 rouble scav case runs. **The bottom line is: My average profit per run was -623 roubles which adds up to a total loss of 62,300 roubles after the 100 runs**. Here is the data: 


* [Graph of each individual runs final profit after subtracting the 70,000 rouble cost](https://i.imgur.com/aVAIJoI.jpg)

* [Graph of the total profit of all the runs over time](https://i.imgur.com/fK22XNw.jpg)

* [List of the contents and sell price breakdown of each run ](https://i.imgur.com/PGvxmZn.jpg) 

Some notes on methodology: 

* The recorded item sell price is either: 1. The lowest current price on the flea market or 2. The best sell price from traders, whichever was greater.

* The sell price is usually rounded to the nearest 100 roubles for simplicity

* Flea Market prices were taken at various times of day between today and early February. I figured getting a wide range of price data would be more representative of the average price then recording prices at a set time of day/day of the week

* I have a screenshot of every run. I figured the table would suffice and uploading and organizing a 100 image Imgur album would be a bit much. But if anyone has a need/desire for them I'd be glad to share them.

Here are some high value / pesky collection quest items I received.

1 Tank battery, 2 OFZ Tank Shells, 1 Tetriz, 1 Keytool, 2 Flash Drives, 1 Folder with Intelligence, 1 SSD, 1 Dry Fuel and 3 high value keys: 1 Labs Access, 1 Labs Yellow, 1 Military Checkpoint Key

The highest my running profit got was about 1,235,828 roubles after run #29.

My main conclusion is in line with the common opinion of the Scav Case: It is fun and has potential to get some nice rare items, but it's by no means a reliable source of income. 

Hope eveyone is staying healthy, I wish you the best of raids!",47,1585338637,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq47tf/100_scav_case_runs_profit_data_visualizations_and/,EscapefromTarkov,1
fq46qr,doom_the_boom,Fix for all stuttering problems,"PSA - Fix for all your stuttering issues

TL;DR - System copy windows onto an SSD and boot up using your SSD. not only will Tarkov run smoothly, but your system will run faster as well



     For the past month or so, my game had begun to freeze, making the game unplayable. I had tried everything, rigorously tearing my connection, buying more ram, messing with my bios settings, overclocking, and even resetting my cmos to get a fresh boot. However, these problems kept persisting.

     I opened up my console(ingame) and whenever i was inraid, my gameUpdate, frameUpdate, and update values would begin to light up like a christmas tree, and then my fame would begin to slowdown. 1 minute into the raid, my game would begin to stutter violently, to the point where the screen was frozen for the majority of the raid. 

     To fix these issues, since no other steps were working, I decided that the bests method would be to create a system clone of windows onto a new SSD that i had ordered for about $50. 

🚨 IMPORTANT 🚨 
make sure the SSD you order has more space than your current HDD, as you will be essentially cloning your system to your SSD. It doesnt have to be bigger than the total size of your hdd, but only have more unallocated space than the space taken up on your HDD. ALSO, make sure you have backed up your files from your ssd, as ALL the data on that ssd will be wiped.

The method i used was to use EASYUS, free version [use a fake email and use the fake trial of the paid one once installed] and then made a system clone of Windows 10 onto the SSD. This may take a while, depending on the size. (around 3 hours for me). once this is done, disconnect your hdd, or change the boot order of your drives to using your ssd as your primary drive. 

This method worked for me and my friend; but if you have questions, feel free to message me about any problems you encounter. ALSO, I Am NOT ENDORSING EASYUS, THAT IS JUST THE FIRST SOFTWARE THAT I TRIED USING. PLEASE TRY LOOKING UP TUTORIALS ONLINE FOR HOW TO CLONE YOUR SYSTEM, AS I MAY HAVE LEFT OUT STEPS.",11,1585338553,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq46qr/fix_for_all_stuttering_problems/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Instead of removing the secure container or making take into raid only. Why not just put it on a timer? Like you cant put anything into it until say 5 or 10 minutes into the raid. I could really think of any downsides. People could still potentially hatchet run if they wanted too, but it's a lot more risky. Eventually they'll bring in gear to protect their loot they find early in the raid, like the rest of us.",23,1585335873,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq3abn/idea_to_counter_hstchlings/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fq35w1,HaZyLaZyUK,Put a stop to Scav on Scav Violence.,"I am pretty new to the world of Tarkov and what a brutal world it is, made even more brutal with all the Scav on Scav violence that goes on. 9 times out of 10 during a ""Scav Run"" I get taken out but rarely do I seem to get killed by PMCs. I am currently on 68 KIA and 24 Survived.. I would say 85% of those games were/are Scav runs can i can tell you now, I can probably count on one hand how many of those kills were from PMC players.. The rest, Scavs..

Example.

Just this morning I was running Reserve and 2 or 3 PMC where taking on the boss and the geared guys.. Scav comes up behind me and I am watching the action waiting to Scav and I look at him and mumble and turn back to face action, he then proceeds to shoot my in back of my head, giving away his position (And me hoping) that he got killed, 2 PMCs were downed and so were the geared NPCs would have been enough loot for both but this short sighted tool messed everything up, I didn't even have anything worth taken, and we both could have gotten out geared up.

So, enough of the Scav on Scav violence, I really think BattleState Games should show you the username of the scav that killed ypu, instead of hiding behind a random Russian name.

Just my thoughts, loving the game (For the most part)",14,1585335537,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fq35w1/put_a_stop_to_scav_on_scav_violence/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I’ve been thinking about reworks and how they could be implemented. At its current state, strength feels like this thing that just kinda exists. 

My rework would be something that is beneficial to all players, but isn’t broken at the top level.

For levels 1 through 50 the player would a 1% weight reduction, per level, on all worn items. 
With level 1 being 1%, 25 being 25%, 50 being 50% weight reduction. Level 51 could be something like 60%. A considerable boost, but not broken.

Got the 2 gates that need keys in one run, no problem. The next life I get the tunnel spawn and just hoof it across the open in a hail of fire from a 3 man in the back spawn. One clips my legs but I get around the corner and keep going. Get to the door, open and get lit up again as I go in to the left. I limp towards the extract when 3 sets of footsteps rush in nades come flying in but I hear someone on bridge or top office just light these guys up in the open as they try to rush me, a hatchling. Nade kills me but those idiots just wasted there run for a 15k dog tag.

Next run, I decide to bring a spare nade just in case. This time I spawn on the other side and have to run thru office. I take off, go up the stairs and thru the bathroom. I already here at least 2 ppl killing scavs up in the office area as I go thru but I just keep going. I decide to take the stairs and not jump over then I here a M4 or hk just unload on me as I pass the corner toward the door. I turn to see three gear af players, one with an altan, charging out of the 2nd floor hole. I ready my nade and throw it straight up so it'll land on the stairs or the landing above. Bang!

fpz7yk,redsquirrel0249,Why do you want the 9 other confirmed AK variants to be in the game? (There's ~20 in game now),"Took a stroll on the weapons page on the wiki and mused over the future of the game. With multiple DLCs, tons of pending features, and nearly a hundred guns that the devs want to add, I'd like to know your position on a huge potential timesink for BSG going forward: gun variants and balance.

Not counting the 9mm and shotgun body styles, there are almost 20 AK variants in the game right now. With such a detailed game, some may be brought in because of this variety, while some may not see the point of having two distinct guns with only one minor difference.

What do you think?

Personally, I think 20 is already too many or is just enough. Games like Battlefield have shown that it's nearly impossible for a game with 60+ guns to have an appropriate niche for each of them. Not every gun in this game needs a niche per se, but when the difference between one gun and another is compatibility with a gas tube or having mounts for a night scope and nothing else, does it really enrich the game? Sure, price is another layer of depth in this game, but when such guns vary in cost by less than 10% of their value, does that really impact your choice?

fpz2m7,MrDoodlezz,The overweight system and the hatchlings need a fix desperately,"TL;DR Both problems are still super bad. Picking up a weapons case is a death sentence now and 90% of Reserve players are hatchlings.

So I loaded up a Reserve raid with a decked AK-105 with 3 60-rounders of BS. I get the shitty spawn on the bottom left corner of the map with enemy PMCs on either side. I kill 2 hatchlings and a low gear/level PMC on their way to tech room. Then I check out tech room, but nothing was there. I proceeded to go to the Marked Room and lo and behold: **a weapons case**.

I pick up the weapons case and immediately sprint to the hermetic switch, leaving me without stamina because I am now overweight. I find a few AKs along the way to hermetic kill another 3 hatchlings at black knight after which I go to the train station type thing (not the building with the paracord spawn). 

But then the alarm stops and I realise it's taken me super long to get to there, simply because I couldn't walk and regain stamina at the same time. I was rushing all the way there and couldn't make it in time. I walk to the bunker and dump my beta2 there, thinking I'd just run back and forth quickly. I go to the switch, pull it, go in between king and black knight and get 180 no-scoped by a random A.I scav that had just spawned there. 

This has just become a sad reality of me doing PMC raids on Reserve and getting fucked by the extracts and the overweight system while almost only seeing hatchlings as other PMCs. 

I love this map, with a passion, but hate the extracts. It's impossible to play without an RR and especially so with the new overweight system. 

BSG, a suggestion: make it so you recharge stamina while walking when you are overweight, it would make it so much better and it wouldn't punish players for finding good loot, on a map where you can't get to the extracts without having to cross out in the open.

fpyu2p,letmeinruhe6,Wipes are awful for pleb-players,"I already posted this text to the forum, but i was advised to make a post on reddit so here we go:

 

I´d say that there are 3 ""levels"" of players, the pleb, a guy who plays a lot of games, from a lot of genres, an ""intermediate player"" who plays just a few games or one genre of game, who tryhards and takes the game serious, and the ""Hardcore dedecated player"", a guy who basically only plays one game, but is therefore very skilled and knowing, e.g people like streamers or youtubers.

I bought the cheapest version of the game a few months ago, and ,for me, the game is really awesome and a lot of fun, however i would consider myself a pleb- intermediate player, as i play some other games as well, and just quit the game for a week or so, if im tired or tilted of a game.

I started to watch some content and guides to loot, game mechanics and missions, and found out about wipes, and im honestly desperate. 

I really hate the idea of loosing everything with a wipe, all my hard earned money, hideout upgrades, cases and shitty mission completions, all for nothing, im allready demotivated to play as everything will be gone in a few months.

I get why experienced, form me so called "" Hardcore dedecated players"" are looking forward to a wipe, as i can understand that its boring for a good player that basically has infinite ammounts of money, to always have the same game,without a meta change or so, but i think its terrible for plebs/intermediate players like me. I think almost every online game has to have players form all 3 ""levels"", to survive, unless its known for being for a certain group of people, like the ""dark souls"" series, which is notorious for being very hard. (and its not an online game).

I knew that tarkov would be hard and punishing before, but i didn\`t know about the wipes. For me as a pleb, and i honestly think a ton of players that aren´t only playing tarkov, wipes are a reason to quit.

Dont get me wrong i´m not only playing for progression, but its so tedius to do a lot of stuff, like having space problems all the time, or leveling skills, or doing bad missions, that are already bad the first time im completing them right now. Pay2grind is okay but not if my grind gets resetted, and i honestly think i speak for a lot of players/plebs here. If you want the game to be the way it is right now, only for dedecated tarkov-only players, which you can do, you should advertise it as such and tell me in advance that there is a forced, not voluntary reset every now and then as i honestly  probably wouldnt have bought it.

fpypeu,Mardhyn,Let people play the game they want to,"And instead if you hate a particular gameplay style, go out and counteract it.

* If you hate campers, make sure you have nades on you.
* If you hate hatchet runners, put on a glock with drum mag and rush the spawns first. Camp it, kill them.
* If you hate thermals go use one yourself and see how often you get one tapped, just as much as anyone else.
* If you hate Vepr Hunters/Mosins, just realize that for right now they are the great equalizer. They also make sure scavs pose an actual threat to players, not like anyone is dying to a Vepr .366.
* If you hate low gear players, get over it. You see so many streamers bitch and bitch and bitch and bitch and bitch because they risk meta gear and kill someone with a pistol. Stop being so jaded, you murdered the person. The time they tap you with vepr/m1a/mosin just chock it up to Tarkov you baby, we all die why are you no fucking different.

I get we are all stuck in quarantine right about now trying to enjoy the game, and Tarkov has a lot of things that are frustrating.

But baby rage is not the answer, if you specifically hate something go out and counteract that playstyle. I guarantee you if you try and checkmate a particular type of player and actually focus on doing so, you can. And if you can't and get outplayed, that doesn't mean the game needs to change because you find it infuriating. Play with the rules your given, don't act like a Tom Brady where you supersede the rest of the population.

Otherwise do like most of us do, load in with what you got and make the most of it. Take a nice stroll through hell and see if you make it out.

fpy5da,Crypto01,"60 minute wait times, 20 minute averages.","I purchased this game last week, and the one thing that I have had to deal with right away are the absolutely insane wait times to get into a game. As of writing this post me and my friend have been waiting 53 minutes to get into a game on factory using the Australian server. There is only one option to select here (Based in sydney) and it has completely unacceptable wait times. It doesnt matter what time I play, I always have waits of about 15 minutes minimum, worse if im not solo. I think it is insane that I paid about $80 for a game that I basically cannot play. Something needs to be done to adress this issue, especially when you are forced to play a variety of maps for quests, some less popular than others. It is currently almost 12:30am on saturday morning as of writing this, I do not believe that it is taking over 1 hour to find 4 other plays for me to play factory for my quest, and the wait times are even worse if I try to play a map like Customs. Add more servers, allow us to select more, add the ability to get into a game that only has scavs/raiders or something. I undersrand you have game integrity to worry about, but making players wait 1hr for a game is absolutely out of control. I also know I am not the only person, my friend warned me about wait times before I bought it but this is insanity.

Are the servers as trash as they used to be? Ranges of 1500% - 450% more latency that other games servers.

How forced are you to hand over even more cash than the initial buy price of the game for that stuff just to enjoy the base game?

fpwtsl,Steepergold,A young ratling's humble achievement,"I've finally done it, fellow rodents! Since scurrying onto the Tarkov scene a few days ago, things have been looking rather bleak for me. Of the 18 or so raids to my name (all of which have taken place on customs), only 1 has been a successful extract. I've been doing my best to follow the rat code: lurking in the bushes, looting the corpses that have already been all but picked clean long ago, fleeing from any sign of conflict, etc. Alas, a roving Chad has snuffed me out time and time again....until now.

Armed with nothing but a ComTac and feeble Makarov, I scuttled into the forests of customs. In true rat fashion, I crawled through the underbrush inch by inch, making little more than the occasional scratch or snuffle. The crackle of gunfire and thunder of grenades filled my ears as I snuck past dorms, yet still I remained unseen. Eventually, I made it to the aftermath scene of a battle by the railroad track. After furiously scanning the area with my beady rat eyes from afar, I cautiously looted the scene. Although it yielded little more than a ScavBP, loose morsels, and a pair of rifles, I squeaked with delight as I made my way back into the underbrush.

As the firefights of the forest raged on, I snuck by a few feet away, always near, but never seen. Before long, I slipped through the Scav checkpoint and into ZB-1011, bouncing from bush to bush away from prying eyes. After waiting a solid five minutes by the extract site and confirming the coast was clear, I bounded for the basement and made my escape.

While this was little more than a day's work for the average Tarkov rodent, I still felt the need to share my progress with you all. Before long, I'll be ready to risk my first rat attack.....maybe....",5,1585315299,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpwtsl/a_young_ratlings_humble_achievement/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpwi8r,SpockGottaGlock,Hatchlings are friends not food,"It was a bad situation overall. Me and my buddies were pinned down by two chads in interchange through a tight doorway. Suddenly, a 7.62 rips through my friends head, killing him instantly, and the rest of the chads fully automatic fire blacks out my last squadmates legs, leaving me somehow unscathed. As I peek the corner with my decked AK-105, the chads sprays of bullets black my right leg, travel up my vest and crack my visor. Neither of us had grenades, but apparently one of the chads did. A frag flew through the air, practically in my buddy's lap. The blast killed him instantly, and the shrapnel blacked my right arm and injured my torso and stomach even more. As I began to back up, a hatchling ran towards me. I raised my gun momentarily, before realizing the enormity of my luck. I began to wiggle, and with his wiggle as a response, I pointed towards the doorway and shouted the chads position. The hatchling suddenly understood. He teabagged momentarily, a show of his reliability, and in that moment I knew he would not fail. I pushed up, and he charged in and broke through their crossfire, surprising them both and forcing their fire away from the doorway. He only lasted a few seconds, but that was all I needed to put 60 rounds of 5.45x39 through both the chads. I reloaded, and retrieved my hatchling savior's tags.

That's when I spotted a player scav who turned around and looked at me, I freaked out and popped off a shot it missed. Then he starts wiggeling, and I friendly wiggle back.

Now that we are friends we went to the garage area where we got ambushed by a player scav or 3. I dropped all 3 with my OP-sks and we looted them. That's when I found out that they hit my friend and he was badly injured. He heals himself up and we head to the big bunker area. We kill the raiders and a player scav and we loot them. 

That's when my new friend wants to extract so we head to heating pipe, I spot an enemy scav in the bunker and I shoot him. We go to loot him and thats when 2 player scavs ambush us. I spray them down with my p90 from a raider that I looted, but they got some shots off. I look behind me to check on my friend and I see his lifeless body on the floor..... I get hit with a wave of sadness, I started looting my now dead friend while holding back tears. 

I know he wanted me to escape with the loot we fought so hard for so I decide to head to heating pipe. But when I walked out of the bunker I saw a chad standing there, I try to get some shots off but my gun is empty. I quikly think back to the short adventure I had with my friend.

fpvjcz,DyslexicCamel13,Thoughts on the game recently,"tl;dr thanks for fixing servers, working great, cheaters are singlehandedly ruining the game more for me than server issues did, by several magnitudes (yes another cheater thread)

&amp;#x200B;

\- I think you guys have done an AWESOME job with the servers. Seriously, kudos. I remember a couple weeks ago, I was regularly getting disconnected from raids right when joining and having to force disconnect and it was frustrating as hell. Hasn't happened since.

\- Queue times are great here in USA, not sure about other regions

\- I feel like scav AI was ninja-nerfed, maybe in a good way. I haven't been wtf-headshotted out of nowhere by scavs in quite some time. Or maybe I just got better over the past few weeks, who knows. Thanks for addressing that.

\- Cheaters are making me not want to load this game up at all anymore. Maybe my sample size is larger because I've had a lot of free time lately, but 1 out of 5 of my games, sometimes multiple back to back (regardless of map, but definitely most obvious on labs) results in a death by someone flying onto the screen and killing me. 80% of the time it's someone with an obvious cheating name, random ass numbers, or some super troll name like LabsBoss222 (I've seen this guy over and over and keep seeing different variations of his name. It's been 2 months - how many EOD accounts is this guy buying?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, this game would be probably a 10/10 experience if it weren't for losing significant progress by fighting cheaters. First I thought it was just labs, now I'm getting spawn killed on Customs on a fresh raid? Now I'm having a speedrunner fly past me as soon as I spawn into Emercom on a fresh raid? Come on man. Enough is enough. You are making a hardcore game, right? There is nothing hardcore about someone seeing me through walls, flying across the map, killing me without a line of sight, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure this is a beta. It largely is playable and when it works its the best game on the market IMO. But when such a significant amount of time is lost because of a cheating problem, it just reeks of the same thing that killed PUBG for me after a few thousand hours. That REALLY worries me because this game is special as was PUBG and I don't want to see that get ruined again for us all.

&amp;#x200B;

Please do something about it. BattleEye clearly isn't doing jack shit. Stop leaving things on client side would also be a good start, but I don't have the technical knowledge on how to go about that or what it actually entails so please enlighten me if I'm being ignorant. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is \*NOT\* a threat, but realistically if the real version of the game launches with a cheating problem this bad, there is no way in hell I'll be playing; I'll have moved on to another competitive shooter by that point. I am no one special, so sorry if this sounds like some demeaning or demanding post, I just feel like history is repeating itself as we saw happen with PUBG and it really bugs me.",5,1585309553,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpvjcz/thoughts_on_the_game_recently/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpupoh,Mazarev,I have connection issues and don't know what to do to fix them.,"Hello Tarkov Community,

I have a problem with Escape From Tarkov. As you can see from the title I have connection issues. 

Let me first show you what I mean:  
Whenever I load into a map, as SCAV or PMC, I get disconnected 1 minute after. This always happens. (I always check to confirm that I'm lagging by simply dragging an item in my inventory to another slot and seeing it flash and not move at all...) Only when I reenter ther 2nd time the game runs smoothly and I have no connection issues at all for the rest of the round. The errors I get are either ""Server Connection Lost"" or ""Anticheat Connection Lost"". 

&amp;#x200B;

My specs (Yes I play on a Laptop and yes I know that I only have 8GB of RAM instead of the recommended 16GB. Is that maybe the issue?):

HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop:  
CPU: Intel i5-9300H  
RAM: 8GB  
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650  
Drive: 1TB SSD

The game runs steadily at 60 FPS, so I think that my specs might not be the main source of my problem although 8GB more RAM would be good and I'm planning on adding them in the future.

Also my Internet Connection is of 120 Mbit/s (Download) so approx. 15 MB/s which in my opinion should be more than enough. I play through LAN not Wifi. And I don't have anything running in the background when playing EFT. No TS3, Discord, Web Browser, Steam or anyhting else. Just the launcher and the game itself.

I don't have internet problems with any other game than EFT so that's why I don't really think that it's a problem from my side, but who knows. That's why I write this Post. 

Now what I tried doing:  
\- Make the Game and Launcher Run as Administrator  
\- Under Task-Manager -&gt; EFT.exe -&gt; Properties -&gt; Safety -&gt; I gave EFT Full Control  
\- Other Internet Cable (Although I get the max. result at Speedtests for both)  
\- Clear Caches and Temp Data off of my Laptop  
\- Open Inbound Rules for the Launcher to all Profiles (No inbound rules for EFT?)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, this kind of sums it up. Maybe somone here had or has the same problem and we can come to a solution together.

fptsto,ply_ranger_joe,RMT its effect on cheating and an unpleasant way to solve it.," 

In the last few months and weeks we have seen a steady rise of cheaters in tarkov, it's not as bad as in the days before BSG added BE but definitely a problem as a part of the community already stopped going on certain maps to avoid the frustration.

Cheating has and will always be a part of online gaming, no matter how much money a studio/publisher throws at it, there will be some cheaters. But why do we have such a high cheater density in tarkov? I personally have been playing multiplayer games for about 20 years, and had to deal with cheaters in various games as a player and as a serveradmin. In no other game did i run into that many obvious cheaters.

There are many possible reasons for this, today i want to talk about the one that has the most impact and that we can actually fix, RMT or real money trading. As i said earlier the war on cheaters is essentially like every war an economic one. 

Cheat providers had some additional expenses and put some more work into their hacks since the introduction of BE, we have seen a phase of a few months where we hardly encountered any cheaters. During that time the cheat providers had to put work and therefore money into their hacks to get them BE ready, which also had an impact on prices. Basic economics the cost of manufacturing rose, therefore the prices rose too. That was a very good first step, the second one is the continued work of the BE team, detecting new hacks and banning accounts this all leads to the cheaters having to spend more money on new hacks and new accounts.

Now BSG has to take the next step, and i tell you it's a painful one because they told us they would not do this and don't want to do this. But I think we as a community have to ask for this …

**BSG needs to add their very own real money trading store, while undercutting everybody else.**

Before you reeeeee at me for obvious reasons bear with me for a second. As i said earlier its an economic war, we raised our enemies cost, had a short time victory but the enemy is coming back. RMT is the reason for this, cheaters can and do farm rubles and items to sell on various sites meaning they not only can pay their expenses (cheat and EFT licence cost) but also make a profit. Also RMT isn't a new phenomenon, it's as old as MMORPGs and there are people who do this for a living. What BSG can and should do about this is to start an economic war with the RMTraders, a war they can win without much risk while even making money with it. They need to add their own RMT market, rubles only, and heavily undercut the market prices. Every player out there who is currently buying rubles from these RMT will in the future buy from BSG because it's faster, safer and cheaper. RMT will not make a profit any longer, the ones who are in just for the business will move on to more profitable games and the cheaters who stay now have to pay for their hacks and new EFT licences. This will lower the amount of cheaters and therefore also hurt the profit of cheat providers who will have to raise prices and/or will also move on to other games where they can make more profit.

Of course all of this will also have an impact on the normal non-cheating community, the BSG real money store will give everybody who is willing to pay more than enough rubles for a wipe cycle for next to no cost because BSG setted the ruble price low to destroy the market. There will be people who enjoy the game as it is and won't buy rubles, but there will also be many casual players who struggled earlier who will buy rubles so they can play with full/better gear when they have time to play. If the end result of this are full servers with 99% full equip players i am fine with it.

What also will become an issue that BSG needs to address is the hyper-inflation the real money trading store will add to the game. Items which are already sold by traders will stay at that price as long as they are not scarce, so BSG needs to remove the global limits to avoid M995 ammo from costing 100k per bullet. Another issue will be quest items like LEDx, these need to be changed too, to avoid another blackmarket the game needs a higher spawn rate for these items but in exchange the hideout upgrades / quests need to have a find in raid restriction.",8,1585300170,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fptsto/rmt_its_effect_on_cheating_and_an_unpleasant_way/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fptiwl,raipeh,To the newer players struggling to get Flea Market / level 10,"TL;DR minimize Scav usage, play as your PMC.

^(It came out as a long read, bear with me.)

As we all know, there's been a huge influx of new players given Tarkov's recent surge in popularity - and many of the newcomers are struggling to get to level 10 to open the Flea Market, that would give them an easier time in the world of Tarkov. By now, some of them have left, never gotten over the learning curve - but those who stayed, some of you are struggling. With money, gear, and your skills as a player.

A disclaimer: The market doesn't make you a good player. Gear (or ammo) doesn't make you a good player. But they help.

It's very late in the wipe. What you should be doing right now (as a new player) is to learn the maps, extracts and PMC spawns. Map knowledge in this game is the key. This is why you should play as your PMC as much as possible, to learn where you, and your enemies can spawn - and get out from.

And I want you guys to start doing this RIGHT NOW, fuck the gear fear, fuck making big bank or a full stash - start taking your shit out for a walk, it's most likely gonna come back from insurance anyway if you die, because all the Chads are full of juice THIS LATE IN THE WIPE, and the new weight system helps too.

We're already heading fast for the upcoming reset, and you will lose every progress you've made. Sure, that might sting the newer players, but take this end of the wipe perioid as an opportunity to LEARN. You'll be more ready by the time the next wipe comes, trust me.

Sure, I recommend using your Scav on cooldown, and it's a good way to make some extra buck, or just run to the nearest extract with what you spawn with - and transfer it directly to your PMC. Play the FREE gear you just got as the Scav on your PMC and make some PROGRESS with the real deal - it's only roughly 40,000 experience for level 10. A Scav kill is what, 300 xp? Kill a few per raid and loot something - that's already 500 xp even if you die. Add in the tasks you can complete as your main character, and more succesful raids &amp; extractions ramp up that number quickly.

# This right here is the catch: by playing as your PMC is the only way to PROGRESS your PMC, and to get closer to the level 10 Market-gate. Anything you do as a Scav keeps progress on your Scav ONLY, unless you happen to find a find-in-raid task-item.

Reposting my images, here's what your progress will look if you play more on your [PMC](https://i.imgur.com/tXH74HV.png) than your [Scav](https://i.imgur.com/pul4tjP.png). Sure, I've put in the hours, and this is my 3rd wipe. I was as lost as most of you are right now on my 1st.

Quoting myself from an other thread:

&gt;*Your Scav does level up and gain skills though - next time you're Scav-running, open your inventory and  take a look at the overall / stats tab, you'll see your Scav level and  his skills. Compare those to your PMC's, which one is higher?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*And  yes, I know in the main menu / character tab it says ""overall"" on the level / skill page while PMC / Scav are greyed out, but that's wrong. It only shows you your PMC's stats, not overall stats.*",2,1585298581,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fptiwl/to_the_newer_players_struggling_to_get_flea/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fptbmx,Distiler,My first friendly player scav encounter,"A few days ago I had my first encounter with a friendly player scav, since I started playing this game \~2 months ago.

I was on a scav run, on Woods and spawned near Tank IED with an AK and a 45-round mag. I looted the secret stashes nearby and found some ammo for my AK so I decided to top off my ONLY mag. I unloaded my gun but I forgot that mag needed 3 slots(I only had a Scav vest and my Army Bag was almost full) so it got dropped on the ground.

Right after I dropped my mag and remained defenseless, I hear some leaves rustling behind me and when I turn around a player scav appeared. He didnt shoot right away, probably was trying to see if I'm a player or NPC and he notices my ""mag-less"" AK. 

He looks at the dropped mag and then back at me. Even if I had 1 round in the chamber, I wasn't confident I could hit a headshot so I switched to my melee and was getting ready to die. To my surprise at that moment, he still wasn't attacking me so I did a quick crouch spam and got a response in return.

I dropped him a Fleece Cloth as a sign of good will(and to make room for my mag). He picked up the cloth, I got my mag and we each went our separate ways.

If you're reading this, random scav player, I wish you only Bitcoin and LedX loots.",4,1585297386,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fptbmx/my_first_friendly_player_scav_encounter/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpt8yc,Beav3r,Bolt action vs semi auto balance. And barrel length in general,"Right now there is no point to use bolt action rifles because they have the same damage and ballistics as semi auto rifles. I've heard that bsg wants to implement malfunction system so bolt action rifles will be reliable and  that's going to be their strong side but that's it?

But I want to touch another topic. Almost all top tier sniper rifles in the world are only bolt action, because bolt action has better accuracy and more muzzle velocity, because all energy of gun powder goes exactly into the bullet. In semi auto rifles it goes into the bullet and into gas stock, thus losing some energy. 

In game semi-auto and bolt action have the same damage.

Longer barrel length allows bullet to get more energy and speed thus giving it more velocity and penetrating power.

Now in game all damage values are tied to ammo type only. Which means a bullet fired from a pistol and an SMG of the same caliber has the same damage and pen. Same with assault rifles. A bullet fired from 510mm barrel will have more energy than a bullet fired from 254mm barrel.

How about adding multipliers to bolt action tifles and bultipliers tied to barrel length?  For example a 10% difference in damage and pen between M4 with 254mm barrel and 510mm barrel.",65,1585296973,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpt8yc/bolt_action_vs_semi_auto_balance_and_barrel/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I've bought my friends a total of 4 red rebels so we could extract together and in return they like to give me a key or meds or something I need for a quest or whatever. I wouldn't mind John doe making $20 for grinding 10 thousand rounds of m995 of he did it legit. Hell why not. Skill, numbers, good ammo, and solid comms are what win engagements so I mean who cares that new level 10 is running gen4 and airframes that he bulk bought for $40.

I know a lot of people in this game that get carried to 10 mil roubles by a good group just to blow it playing solo because they are trash at the game.

fps5cn,Thehazbeen,"When its good its GOOD, when its bad its BAD!!!","Most of us have probably been in this position! 

Yesterday i did a SCAV run, spawned in with a key worth 600k+, got 6 kills and got out! The feeling was great...like im actually making progress in this game and its difficulty! Maintaining my 3kd and climbing felt good! It was basically like that all day. 

Today....more SCAV runs pretty much expecting the same thing or something similar, really feeling like im getting to grips with this game. NOPE....the entire day im running into low level PMCs &amp; other SCAVs hiding in what felt like every corner, especially on Shoreline. Maybe it was just me being over confident and storming around loudly but HOW can you play a game like that....just sitting there for im assuming minutes and minutes  on end. Its one thing to exit camp, but its another thing to hide in random buildings and bushes with your PMC just waiting for someone....

Anyways, thats the beauty of this game i suppose. It can incredibly frustrating and the way some players play can be irritating. BUT, i feel like thats what makes it so good, when you manage to kill/avoid these types of players and get out time after time, it makes it that much more enjoyable! Thats what i love about this game, it can be so difficult but it can also be so rewarding!

fpryt2,Zoltan-PYRO,"A step-less weight system, instead of 2 harsh steps system, natural","Hello everyone,

weight is an important stat, that should be in the game, but not in the way it is now.

Make it step-less instead:

Let the debuffs slowly increase by 0 kg ----&gt; + 1 pound / + 500 gramm ----&gt; up to 75 kg.

So you wouldnt have these 2 harsh 2 steps by 40 kg and 75? kg. 

No more these situations where you are slugging around with 41 kgs and your enemy is bunny hopping around with 38 kg gear. 

It would make the weight system so much more intuitive, realistic and less punishing.

It would give also a second chance for at the moment neglected gear.

Light gear runs would make more sense, because a lightly geared player, by around 18 kg, would have an significant agility, mobility, ergonomic, endurance and strength advantage in comparison to a 38 kg geared player.

The current primitive weight system only punishes looting and has otherwise almost no positive effects.

Better? My approach would at least

1. Be way more realistic

2. Nerf bunny hopping

3. Be Way less punishing

4. bring ~ 60 % of the ingame gear back into consideration.

5. Give players the opportunity to fine tune their load out to find a good compromise between lethality, agility, endurance and speed.",17,1585289873,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpryt2/a_stepless_weight_system_instead_of_2_harsh_steps/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpq6ca,Pizzerizgud,The frustrations and rantings of a low level Tarkov player.,"I have 90 hours in my 122 day old account. Im a recently turned level 8 player who hasn't played for more than a day in a row since the last patch because im constantly getting pissed off. Not because I die but because of almost everything going on outside of raids. 

The recent patch has really screwed me. Especially with the new minimum level for flea market. 
This patch has basically fused my hands with sks rifles because its the only gun that has ps ammo I can get from Prapor. 

Not long ago I was so very close to completing the delivery from the past mission but failed (Imagine the shock on my face when I realized that you loose the quest item when you die, and in one of the hardest maps too, for _me_ atleast). But that wasn't _too_ big a deal to me (Thats a lie I was devastated because I had just finally managed to eat enough shit to get it). 

What really ticked me off after failing the mission was that I would have to spend another 30 minutes refreshing Fence to get semi-semi decent ps ammo 
(only for me to get a error and it be gone it the flash of an eye. I literally cannot buy more than one bullet at a time without getting an error, if anyone knows
how to fix that plz help) for my puney Kalashnikov because the ammo that _is_ readily available to me are bullets that equate to spitballs. 

I saw a post on the BS forums saying that the flea market should not go back to level 5 because players should not have access to all the things the flea market provides at such a low level. And that people saying they don't play enough hours to level up quick enough don't deserve it. Here's the direct quote: ""This game is designed to have progression, and if you don't have the time to make that progression happen, then you don't deserve to reap the benefits"". 

When I first read this I was really pissed off at the ignorance of this person but then after doing a bit of thinking I realized I understood his sentiment and actually somewhat agreed with it. 
Do I think a level 5 player should be in gen4 armor and have a decked out m4? No. But then I did a bit more thinking and said to myself ""no fuck that when I started out I dragged my carcass to level 5 for so long the blood trail turned brown"". But then again not everyone progresses at the turtle rate I do but it still felt like getting to the finish line of an Olympic race. So my current opinion on this statement is that I somewhat agree but still think my struggle was more than enough to warrant access the flea market.

Honestly, the flea market has become such a cruical part of EFT and for it to be locked behind such a (imo) high level is simply unfair. I have a 3% survival rate with 51 raids under my belt (most of which I died and gained no xp due to the phenomena of ""being in the wrong place at the wrong time"" and or having the game freeze and be forced to look down the barrel of a shotgun for 10 seconds). Pretty impressive for someone who is actually trying eh? I remember my first kill like it was yesterday (no, it was not actually yesterday) and probably will until I (or this game) dies.

 I had a decked out ak101 and got into a firefight with someone who was watching the paradigm warehouse and it was then that I managed to unshackle myself and escape from the grueling dungeon that is gearfear. I realized that you really need to go big in this game and so far that idea is what granted me most of my kills. But after this patch released I was ruthlessley dragged back into that terrible dungeon because I dread having to sit at my computer clicking refresh for a hour just to get some shitty ps ammo.

 When I recieved the ""appretiation"" gift my excitement was _very_ shortlived when I realized that I had no ammo for the m4's because the ammo that _was_ included was 7.62x39 ammo and god knows I was not about to taint the chamber with ps ammo. So the two m4's sit in my inventory along side the ak101 I got my first kill with and serves as nothing more than something nice to look at while my sks rifles get to see all the action.

This post might be a flop but it really does feel good to vent about all my frustrations with EFT, I know I went back and fourth alot but I honestly just needed to vent about how awful i've been doing with this patch before heading back to refreshing Fence for another 100 times to get enough ammo for one raid.

TLDR: For a low level like me playing this patch is like being dragged behind a speeding car on a dirt road.",26,1585281282,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpq6ca/the_frustrations_and_rantings_of_a_low_level/,EscapefromTarkov,1

B\*n them for a week or 2 while you review their gameplay or just keep them b\*nned without seeing the gameplay. I mean nobody is naming their account 'SUIOPGFHWER' and not doing something shady. How is it even getting past battle-eye detection? Surely anyone with extra files or game files that don't have the exact same size as the official branch should be unable to launch, right?

Obviously once these peeps are b\*nned, they're gonna start naming their accounts properly and then you'll have to actually put in proper cheat prevention methods in the game, but at least while you work on that you can just wave the b\*n hammer at these '9ZSGLOLW4' peeps.

fpp8ww,devcrev,A Rare Act of Kindness,"I just wanted to share an interesting experience that I had today on Shoreline. I rushed health resort solo and looted a few rooms on the east side but then, hearing how outgunned I was with PMCs everywhere throwing grenades, I made a run for the admin building. Once I got there I checked the office safe for which I have a key. It was already looted so I started to leave but as I was going down the main stairs of the admin building I spotted a player right at the bottom who promptly made a run for it down into the basement. I followed him down and found him hiding on the bathroom. On instinct I unloaded two shotgun shells into him. At this point I noticed he only had a hatchet out and I chose to stop shooting. At first I was uncertain what would happen since I have been killed several times when I chose not to fight someone even after shaking my head or wiggling. I decided to risk it, backed off, and dropped him my shotgun (which at this point was empty) and he seemed to take this well. After a few head shakes and wiggles he began healing and I dropped him an ifak. He was coughing profusely and moving at a snail's pace so I must've blacked his legs and chest. We stood by each other for a little bit and I dropped him a few items I had found, nothing terribly valuable. He grabbed them and I started to walk away, satisfied at this point with the outcome. Then I heard him smacking the ground repeatedly so I turned and went back to where he was crouched and realized he had dropped me something. I had to examine it so I immediately suspected it might be valuable. It turned out to be a ""chain with prokill medallion"". Again, at the time I had no idea that it was decently valuable but even so, I hesitated to take it. After several vigorous bouts of nodding yes to each other I finally picked it up and put it in my secure container. We then proceeded to make our way outside into the courtyard by the helicopter and were messing around for a few minutes until out of nowhere a scav sprinted out of the building and started shooting at us. Knowing that he had a blacked leg and wouldn't be able to escape if he started taking shots, I charged the scav, tried to block the shots meant for him, took some damage, and hatcheted it to death only to turn and see that he had been murdered in cold blood by the scav before I got to it. I was killed by a player scav shortly thereafter but not before I was able to grab this stranger's tags. Once I got out I messaged him and he we had a short conversation which culminated in him telling me to come into factory with him so that he could ""bring me a present"". We loaded up together and right on spawn he proceeded to drop me a Red Rebel (which I still didn't have up to this point). Once again I hesitated to take it knowing how valuable it was. He continued nodding vigorously and with a scav approaching our spawn I grabbed it and we ran to extract. This turned out to be a longer post than I anticipated but the overall moment and this stranger's generosity really struck me. After so many times being completely brutalized in this game I have grown very cynical and never expected something like this to ever happen to me. I think that Tarkov wouldn't be Tarkov if it was all sunshine and rainbows, but it is fine with me if there is some authentic kindness out there once and awhile.",6,1585277262,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpp8ww/a_rare_act_of_kindness/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpob5s,tellwilk,We got ourselves ah MexCan Stand-off,"So there I was in Interchange looking for scavs to kill boom run it to a three man in oli. So I hide in the office space. They hunt me down. I find my Alamo and hold it, cracked a head shot to start the engagement. They try to lure me out with a fake firefight i think. I don’t bite it. So they try to push in the room but I got a nice angle and managed to fatally wound one of them. The third guy is scared to push in I gave him enough time to plan my demise after a few probes on my position. (im talking minutes here) 

I am rocking a built ish m1 locked in a room. I brake it down and unpack my mags put components and m80 m61 in my BUTT. Running low on energy and water I’m concede my defeat as I am in the Alamo. I start looting the computers in the room for xp and some quests items I find a quest item replace it with  my m80 rounds do some healing and prepare to see my maker. I open the door trying to bait this guppy, no bite:( I run out the room and down a hallway and start seeing tracer rounds and think “damn this guy is running tracers” while I am dying. 

Take aways: use good or great ammo, use armor, have friends to play with, don’t chase after someone blindly, bring food and drink for stand-offs, no matter how passive you want to play the player base doesn’t so KOS is a must also don’t chase blindly, last but not least accept loss.  

This was my favorite moment in game so far. Thank you to the two I murder and sorry to the guy at the end of the hallway, you are the best of them.",0,1585273502,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpob5s/we_got_ourselves_ah_mexcan_standoff/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpny4e,emperor_noob,My Wishlist,"Here's my wishlist. I have started making notes to myself as I play and these are the biggest things. It's long, not in order, and not complete. I know a lot of it has been talked about or is planned, but I don't know the priority list of BSG so I'm going to put it all down anyway. If you disagree with something, offer meaningful input, such as why, and possible alternatives. As a final note, I'm heavily in favor of the ""simplified realism"" BSG has moved towards. We don't need another arcade looter shooter, every major company already has many years of making those and the market is quite flooded with those alternatives, if that's what you like. I'm also not going to join the military to get my fix, so please don't suggest it.

**1: Slower normal reload (makes mag drop useful/reloads more realistic)**

	It takes time to put that magazine away nicely. Maybe drop pouches could buff regular reload times when we have rig modding, but currently it's way too fast. Dump that shit on the ground if you need speed. Also, shotgun speed loaders would be cool, just saying.

**2: Task item pickup/dropoff experience, or no run-throughs, and reduce plant time (10 sec standard?)**

	Coming out of a raid alive should never be punished in a survival game. Tasks are generally the reason for run-throughs, so either add experience enough to picking up or dropping off task items, or get rid of run-throughs entirely (my preference). Also decrease the plant time, it's usually not something that would take 30 seconds to hide, like tucking a small documents case behind some crates.

**3: Raid times: 1 hr+, factory/labs 30 mins**

	I know times were reduced because of the server overload, but let's start getting back to actual raid lengths now. Factory and Labs are small enough maps that 30 mins is sufficient, but the rest should be 1hr minimum.

**4: Weight and Movement balancing**

	Movement needs to be slowed down a bit and inertia needs to play its part. Sprinting is way too fast and there is no build up, it's instantly up to insane max speed. Similar issue with strafing. All movement should be subject to inertia and that inertia should be affected by weight. Weight effects should be a percentage scale, not just a couple cutoffs. Scale it from maybe 20kg to 70kg, anything under is unaffected and anything over doesn't get worse than the current max weight issues. Bunny hopping needs to be fixed, jumping needs to be affected by weight properly, and vaulting needs to be added. Finally, armour should only affect ergo/turn speed (upper body movement), get rid of any movement speed debuffs (lower body movement) as that's the role of weight.

**5: All items adjustable on rails**

	I just want to be able to position attachments better, and if 2 things can fit on the same rail, they should be able to.

**6: Reduce recoil impact of some attachments, increase effect/variance of weight/ergonomics/round type**

	Mostly, a stock is a stock. Unless it is flimsy, it will do the same for recoil whether it's a wooden ak stock or a polymer magpul thing. The same goes for foregrips. Some people just prefer the feel of a handstop versus a full-on vertical grip, but both will allow roughly the same additional control of the weapon's recoil. I'd rather see a focus on the weight and ergonomics of different attachments. Muzzle devices, internal components, weight and length of the gun, etc. are where recoil changes should primarily be reflected in regards to attachments.

**7: All damage leads to reduced maximum health of injured location, increase cms/surv kit use time, pain debuff on surgerized limb**

	Introduce an effect like the cms/surv kits for all meds. Get shot, heal it up but it won't max out as high until you get out of raid. Getting shot shouldn't be erasable in raid. Currently magical field surgery via cms/surv kit is too magical, slow it down, you shouldn't be able to do it conveniently mid-fight. 30-45 seconds would be much better. Also, pain debuffs on repaired limbs would be nice to see. You still technically have a large bullet/surgery hole there, so magic or not it should still hurt. This pain could be temporary (5 mins) or could last all raid, I'd take either.

**8: Limb Penetration**

	Please let high pen rounds go through arms. A hatchling/scav taking a handful of m995 to the arm/hand in front of his chest should not save him. Would also help if we could all finally put our arms down.

**9: Strength/Vitality/Stress Resistance leveling reworked**

	Strength levels too slowly and Vitality/Stress resistance are a pain if you aren't getting shot lightly on the regular. All encourage cheesing. Two accounts into the 40s this patch and I still can barely level any of these through regular play. When I get shot, its usually a player using real rounds and I die pretty quick, which is considerably more intense than getting shot lightly. Also reconsider the tasks and hideout upgrades that require these 3 skills (especially flint, fuck flint)

**10: Stabilize trader prices/unlimited stock, make market find in raid only**

	Let the traders be a stable market. Lock their prices, give them unlimited stock with individual buy limits(these can be adjusted, before someone says the limits are too low), and let the flea market be find in raid only to prevent the weird merching that happens in our post-apocalyptic zone. Too many problems are caused by having this reselling items from the traders bullshit.

**11: Lock secure containers in raid**

	There, I said it. Another bit of magic that people seem overly attached to. I'm fine if it stays, but let it be one way. Store your keys, meds, ammo, or task items in it before leaving and be done with it. Too many issues with people being able to magic the loot from raid to stash. Scav runs are already a wild source of free money. We can do without hatchlings doing anything but tasks.

**12: All non-magnified sights don't change FOV/minimal and equal change**

	Personal pet peeve of mine is the changing fov with non-magnified sights. I don't get magical eye zoom looking down my sights, I've tried. I get that it's a simulated focus thing, but we could do without the zoom. Either apply it minimally and make it 100% equal between all non-magnified sights, or get rid of it. I only thought about it because it's happened a few times with VSSs and I thought wow, this is way better.",6,1585272112,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpny4e/my_wishlist/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Cheaters will continue to plague the game until a.) Real money trading is somehow eliminated or b.) the game drops off enough in popularity that RMT isn't profitable anymore. Ban a cheater, he doesn't care, he'll just buy another copy of the game, he's making more than enough to cover 45 bucks every couple weeks. Ban a cheat, it's only a matter of time before a new one is developed because the cheat creators have massive incentive to appease the cheaters each paying 50 dollars a week for a cheat. The only way to stop the process is if both groups can no longer make money. People aren't cheating to have fun, they're cheating because it's profitable. Can anyone think of a feasible way to stop RMT?",55,1585267271,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpmotf/hackers_arent_going_to_go_away_until_we_have_a/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpmcz3,Stelcio,This cheaters situation made learning the game impossible,"So I'm really, really frustrated by the way I happen to die a lot in this game - getting one-tapped from an unknown direction. The worse thing is - we're playing in a 3-man squad and have our entire team killed this way A LOT. And usually, it's just one guy sniping us out from wherever one by one no matter what we do - move a lot, take cover, fire back, run away... None of us is able to come up with any learning experience from this.

And then I come here and read about how easy it is to cheat in EFT, how many cheaters there are and how little BSG does about it. There's no way to report players. There's no way to even evaluate your performance - a replay, a killcam, whatever.

All this makes it impossible for me to really learn from my games because I will always have doubts if I did the right thing assuming the legitimate competion and the enemy simply had unfair advantage, or if I really did something I shouldn't.

For example some paths are mostly safe but leave you exposed if you're spotted. That's a bit of a risk, but a sensible one. Sometimes you'll get unlucky and encounter someone, that's all. Cheaters may know you're there before they are supposed to be able to spot you. And may be able to get to you in time thanks to cheats. Every single game they're there.

Some actions are justifiable against legitimate players, but suicidal against cheaters. You're flanking from a concealed side, though it lacks cover - if you're made, you're screwed. It's a sensible risk, but a cheater knows you're there. Every single game they're there.

You know you're outgunned, so you try to disengage by breaking the line of sight... You can't break a line of sight with a cheater. And if you simply increase distance between you and the enemy - well, isn't that what aimbot is for?

It's like playing two different games - one you want to play and one you don't. And you never know which one it is this time and if you should consider it a lesson or just forget about it. **Because against cheaters - you're getting punished even for making supposedly right calls. Everytime. Those aren't right calls when somebody has hacks.**

Makes you want to put the game aside... At least for me. For somebody else it might be an incentive to just buy the cheats themselves and play the game the others play on them - on equal grounds this time. Let's be honest, it makes more sense than playing against cheaters without them.

And yes, I am paranoid by this point. And believe me, I wish I wasn't.",33,1585266118,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpmcz3/this_cheaters_situation_made_learning_the_game/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpl4v7,DrRocksos,"I'm getting hackers on every map now, not just labs, and it's getting real bad.","First, sorry for bad English, not my first language.



I went from rarely seeing a hacker on maps other then labs, to seeing them blatantly hacking quite regularly on every map. Speed hacking, wall hacking, aimbot, etc. These have become the norm at this point (it feels like), and it's not like you can avoid them. They Sprint straight at you, cover the whole map in seconds, and then one tap you before you even knew they were there.



When I say 'hacking' I don't mean when a good player rotates. Tarkov is all about great shots and better strategy. I mean, player is moving like the flash and shooting me 3 times in the face with a mosin in .1 seconds. Or player is invisible and literally appears in front of me to kill me. Or player is looting me while I'm standing still, or player is unlocking doors that are impossible to open, etc, etc. 



I'm not a hardcore player. I don't run this game for hours and hours. I play a few runs everyday, and when me (the casual, medium skilled player) is running into hackers almost every game, you're gonna have a problem. I love this game, but I can't even reccomend to friends atm because the state of hacking is so bad.



I'm not some tech whiz, so I have no idea the amount of effort it would take for BSG to fix this, but for me the game just isn't worth playing right now, which sucks a lot, because there's so much good fun to be had with Tarkov. I am really sad because I am passionate about this game, and I don't like to see it like this. It's like when my dog had cancer. I loved him, and I took him to a doctor to get better, but seeing him hurting made me sad. That's how I feel about Tarkov. It just makes me sad now, and I want it to get better.

fpl1dj,hottwhyrd,Tarkov pre-drops event was so much better.,"Any of you guys remember bieng in a low population server?  It was the best.  Some games you wouldn't ever hear a gunshot.  Basically, game starts matching, after 1 minute it loaded loot and went to waiting for players. At around the 3 minute mark the game would start. That's right 3 minute wait time MAX!  Then you were free in Tarkov land to loot, do stupid tasks like ""planting"" things for 2 minutes without any fear of getting sniped by a pmc. Learn maps like woods while also getting loot. It was the fucking best.  I feel bad for new players that are never going to get that experience. Hatchet running wasn't even a thing, because you were only competing with 1 or 2 other players.

fpkyoc,Lemoncarver,It would be cool if backpacks now had a weight 'Distribution stat',"Tl/Dr: it would be cool if backpacks would 'distribute weight' to either reduce the movement speed penalty when under weight, or reduce the weight of items in the backpack. 

Hey guys, so little idea I had after the patch that I have said in comments a few times and decided to post to see what the community would think about it. My suggestion is a stat to be applied to backpacks like the movement penalty they had before expect it would buff movement speed in one of two ways. It either distributes the weight to make movement easier even under heavy weight or it makes items feel lighter. So the first idea would be a movement buff that is a static number and would apply when you get the movement weight debuff. The other would be static reduction of weight to items in the bag. 

For those who cry but the realism! I would ask you to take a duffle bag, backpack, and a bag designed for hiking. Load each up with 50lbs of weight and go for a walk. I'm sure you will be able to move quicker, easier, and longer with the bag that distributes the weight across your shoulders and back the best. Which would be a decent hiking backpack as they are designed to handle more items and weight then the others. 

For those of you who have been a bit frustrated since the recent weight patch this should alleviate some of those frustrations as you can now find ways besides strength training to mitigate the weight debuff. Along with being able to utilize some bigger high end backpacks.

For those who may wonder why one would buy a larger more expensive bag, if you can't carry as much as before. Well the buff stat would give you more motivation to get those high end bags. The market economy may also change a bit to make some bags more desirable then they are now too. 

Anyway, just some thoughts and reasons I feel it would be a cool change to have. Curious what y'all think though, I do feel backpacks need something more then just size and pocket dimensions to make them more unique like the speed penalty before. I want my options to mean something more then just i got it because it was big/cheap.",1,1585261079,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpkyoc/it_would_be_cool_if_backpacks_now_had_a_weight/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpjzrp,PlinkoV2,Shotguns Are Damn Near Useless(Rant),"Pretty much a rant, but I was playing a round on woods trying to complete a subtask for Punisher Part 4 when I came across a sniper with his back turned to me near the mountain stash. I got close enough to him that I was able to secure a shot to the back of his head; however, the dude simply turned around and started shooting. I was caught off guard a little, but I managed to hit 1 more headshot and 4 more body shots(as proven by my screenshot) before being sprayed down by his secondary weapon.

I've gone into a fair amount of raids with shotguns and it's fairly obvious that they are practically useless against armored opponents unless using AP-20 rounds which are quite expensive. The ammo that I was using at the time was Grizzly 40 Slugs. Seriously, a pistol with basic ammo such as Pst gzh would have done more damage in that situation. I've shot unarmored scavs with them often tanking 2-3 hits before dying.

The only way that I feel this could be improved is to add different types of penetrative ammo for shotguns. The selection of such ammo is extremely limited. I do realize that there are many games in which shotguns are extremely overpowered; however, Tarkov's shotguns are quite the opposite being outclassed by basically any other type of weapon in any situation. In my opinion, a balance needs to be found.

fpjfo3,Bread_boy232,How to snipe correctly?,"So recently I took up sniping, due to large amount of squads, I've gotten pretty good, but the issue I'm having is: am I using my gun right? Is there something I'm missing, I set my scope to the right distance, but even then, if the guys stationary the bullet will miss, is there some extra key I need to press, is it in the actual set up of my gun? (I usually run mosin with PU sight), Its getting really hard to work out if I'm doing something wrong or if the hit reg is just a bit off. (for instance, shooting a guy in the head from 100 meters, seeing the blood hit the wall, and later find out it didnt hit), For an assualt player, this isnt an issue, 1 bullet not reging compared to the other 20 that do hit doesnt matter. But for a sniper, that 1 hit is one of few chances you'll get.

I also missed one buried deep inside another bag. Well, only two rigs showed up (even though I 100% guarantee I did not buy any of the 4), so I thought I had done it right. Nope, it took the two full ones, and apparently does not think the two empty ones were ""found in raid."" Silly me, I thought that moving it to my character's inventory had worked. Bye bye ~1Million rubles. I'm pretty sure the biggest ticket items were two moonshine that Ragman snatched up. 

I did this by accident with an MBSS for an earlier quest. I thought I was being careful, this time. 

Seriously, this makes me so salty.

Edit: To clarify, the full rig was being worn, and there was one I missed deep in my inventory. It took those, because I could not open them to verify they were empty.

fpgq1f,ComKrom,Blurriness starting in loading screen,"Apologies for mobile formatting in advance.

I’m currently using a Nvidia GTX 750ti for reference. 

After I updated my Nvidia drivers to the most recent release, booting up Tarkov causes the graphics, even in the loading screen, to become degraded. It starts after a couple seconds from the initial loading screen when my screen turns black and the graphics degradation begins. Occasionally Tarkov loads normally and there is no black screen.   Changing graphics settings in games has no effect. 

I’ve tried reinstalling the drivers and rolling back the driver update to my previous one but it has not worked. I’ve tried searching online for possible solutions but nothing I’ve tried has worked so far. Does anyone else have a solution?

fpfbu3,Warbags,How to make the came more interactive and rewarding in 1 easy step,"I've seen a lot of weird and/or straight up bad ideas concerning ""Hatchlings"" and Chad play not being rewarding enough and I think I've actually fixed the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So instead of fucking with anything existing, imagine this.

&amp;#x200B;

Add X more locked rooms to each map where X is the number of PMCs.  

&amp;#x200B;

Each PMC spawns a key to one of those rooms in a new immutable space, however, that PMC and anyone who is in their squad is UNABLE to use that specific key. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thus these rooms can only be opened by killing another PMC then finding the designated room on the map to earn your reward that NO ONE could get to first.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this because I think it could add a lot of potentially fun and rewarding gameplay as true chadding requires downing every other pmc on the map now.  Hatchlings will still get existing rooms, but now you can play it as a shooter first and a looter second and still get some primo loot.

fpexnu,TheBigUmberto_,A change in how I play has made me more money than I've ever made in this game.,"TLDR: Try using semi-auto DMRs only for a week and see how it changes the way you play the game and the rewards you reap from it.

About a month ago, I picked up an M1A off a guy I killed. Up until that point, I almost exclusively used full auto weapons, mainly VSS and AK-74m's. I decided to try out the M1A for a round and figured I'd just move on after I died and lost it. Well, I ended up having a good round with it. Then another. Then another.

Fast forward to today, I'm exclusively using semi-auto DMR's. Looking back over the past month, I have made more money playing the game than I ever have. In short, using a semi-auto weapon has forced me to play differently, and that different approach leads to less dying, more kills, fewer weapons bought, and significantly less ammo purchased.



I wouldn't say I'm less aggressive, but I'm more tactical with my aggression. I stalk people. I take shots and move. I make huge flanks that may take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. (These are the most gratifying kills.) I'm decisive with where I place myself, allowing me to engage groups of any size. And its never camping. I probably move more than when I would play full auto.

So, how does this make you more money?

Well, for me playing like this has certainly resulted in less dying. One way to have more money is by not losing your loadout every other game. I consistently have streaks of 4 or 5 extracts without a death.

More kills and more loot. I don't know if its because I'm spending more time in-game because I'm dying less, but my kill counts have jumped significantly. Just cause you're not in the thick of it doesn't mean less action. When all your action is happening 50 - 100 yards away from your enemy, and you have the better gun for that range, you have complete control over the situation. So if you center your gameplay around the idea of engaging enemies from that distance, you're almost always at an advantage. Also, significantly fewer deaths from grenades with this approach.

Awesome affordable ammo options and fewer rounds/mags to be purchased. I use the SVD and M1A exclusively these days. I'm always silenced and I always use the HAMR scope with the red dot on top. Running DMR's with the red dot option as opposed to bolt action snipers gives you a chance when the inevitable close-quarter encounters take place. I like both guns equally and don't prefer one over the other. My two presets are pretty barebones with the exception of the silencer and the scope and always fall right around 250k roubles. I only use three 20 round mags. One loaded and two extras in my rig. That makes for 60 rounds loaded into mags and I take an extra 40(the max per single slot for these calibers) that occupy one square in my gamma container. That makes for 100 rounds total going into each round. Personally, when I was running full auto, I was taking four 30 round mags with 100 extra rounds for a total of 220 bullets per round. That's more than double the amount of ammo. There are a lot of effective and affordable rounds in 7.62x51 and 7.62x54r calibers. You can buy the rounds based on your budget.

More on the ammo types. You don't need the best or most expensive rounds of these calibers to take down big boys. Because of playing at range and running semi-auto, you'll naturally become more selective with your shots. I had my biggest come up the other day. I was on reserve running the SVD with LPS gzh. I took out two super chonky chads, both with head shots, both with one bullet a piece. I fired two rounds of LPS gzh, totaling in $300 roubles and after looting the big boys and extracting, I walked out with $2.5 million. I'm not suggesting you run LPS gzh all the time, but if you wanna give this playstyle a shot, the round will get the job done. The beauty is, only rocking 100 rounds of ammo per game, and having 40 in your gamma, even if you buy the good shit, you're not spending a ton anyways.

And lastly, a non-related money comment. I'm having more fun playing the game with this style than I ever have. I don't know if its because I'm making more money. The kills are just so gratifying. Seeing a guy run by 75 yards out, knowing what he's doing and where he's heading, setting up shop, and 1 or 2 tapping him at the right moment with him never having any idea what happened, is just so much fun. I think you play closer to how you would play in real life if Tarkov was a reality, and it adds to the intensity and awesomeness that is Tarkov.

This playstyle certainly isn't for everyone. Some of you may love it. Some of you may try it and not like it. Some of you already know you hate it. But, if you're open to trying new play styles, I highly reccommend it. I've noticed Summit1G embraces this style when he plays, so check out some of his clips to see how a quality player approaches situations.

Anyways, just thought I'd share. It's changed the game for me and certainly has freshened things up.",273,1585241486,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpexnu/a_change_in_how_i_play_has_made_me_more_money/,EscapefromTarkov,8

fpeu9j,letmeinruhe6,Give us the option to select limited gear cost.,"First up im quite new to the game (\~2 months,level 15 no wipe) so this might be a bad/flawed suggestion, but i really like the game right now, however its really hard to get into the game. You have to learn a lot of stuff, and it is really annoing to have very poor gear, while having to play against highly equipped enemys. I watch some content and guids, and multiple times i have heard that streamers are looking forward to a wipe, as it changes the game, and meta of the game for a time. Therefore i suggest to implemet another selection, like time and map, to have a random limit ( perhaps 30-200k) on how expensive the Gear can be(e.g. entire gear, weapons ammunition meds armor and so on must cost less than 50k). It can vary and move from Map to Map and you can choose that ""mode"", or not if you dont want to. You dont have a disadvantage by bringing low tier weapons/ gear and it brings a new strategy into the game when you have for example a limit of 80k and you have to decide if you want the better scope or a better helmet.  Experienced players can play other weapons and new players dont have such a disadvantage .",12,1585241191,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpeu9j/give_us_the_option_to_select_limited_gear_cost/,EscapefromTarkov,0

The best thing we can do to end this hacking surge is to stay vocal - talk to your favorite streamers and content creators in chat about the hacking issue and clip their content when you see hacking.

fpbp3n,snek_of_tarkov,"Strafing needs a nerf so it is less effective at keeping you alive than taking cover. I have made a video comparing ingame combat to the BSG RAID trailer and a bollywood dance scene, see for yourself.","* What the raid trailer promises: Players ducking from shot and doing their best to not expose themselves to fire. 

* This is  achievable with a higher damage for all bullet types and by lowering strafe speed. Only then survival by use of cover is more successful than survival by strafing.

* The current ingame combat is closer to a dancing performance, which I think is not what this game was advertised for.

* It is really simple: If a player does not fear a bullet (from any gun), he will count on his armor to keep him alive while strafe dodging, and that is casual as f.

* Bolt-action rifles and low-damage weapons are affected by it and are made obsolete. Observe what happens when you miss a shot with a bolt-action.

* Anyone who has no problem with many guns being useless because of strafe-dodging, should get as far away from this game as possible and play a game where you brush ponies while drinking soy milk.

fpbnur,MrBobDobalina23,Raid statistics. Possible fix +upgrade soon?,"Hey BSG,

I know you guys are currently hard at work on bug fixes and I'm loving that. Is there any plans to fix (and possibly upgrade?) the raid statistics you get after you die? I'm pretty sure it's bugged (as my screen shot will show) and is in dire need of an upgrade. Specifically, a break down of the combat section on an enemy by enemy basis of how much damage you did to them and how much they did to you, your accuracy, etc would be amazing. Thanks for all your hard work and looking forward to every update!

&amp;#x200B;

Also, for those that like to reply with ""Git Gud"" and what not to every post, I'll do that for you!

fpag4r,jck_litt,The support system,"This is not intended to be a complaining post, more of a constructive feedback for BSG to consider.

Quick backstory: My account was hacked a few weeks ago and I emailed a request to change my email address. That was over 3 weeks ago with no response.

Anyway, I think this highlights a lot of issues with the support system that are extremely common from other players. After looking around, I found many many cases of people losing their $50UDSD+ accounts because support just would never respond. 

I understand that the BSG team is relatively small and that they are working their asses off to fix the game and bring updates but I think you guys should consider these suggestions.

* Fix the FAQ section of the support page on [escapefromtarkov.com](https://escapefromtarkov.com)
   * There are very few questions and very few answers on there
* Allow some form of security question or phone number to reset account details
   * This means that cases like mine won't need to have humans, so minor issues can be automated, meaning players can get back to playing within minutes rather than weeks.
   * This also means people are more likely to stay engaged with the game as I'm starting to lose interest now when there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel.
* Provide clearer guidelines on how to get help from support
   * There is no sort of queue where people can see where they are in line in terms of waiting for a response, as they may think it's hours, less than 10 days as promised in the launcher, or weeks like my case.
   * Save emailing for major problems rather than just everyone and their dog sending requests for email changes.

Hopefully, someone important reads this, but you guys are smart so this is probably gonna happen in the future anyway. In the meantime I'll be waiting for my account :)",6,1585224660,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpag4r/the_support_system/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fpa6uk,ZestStory,Change Alpha containers.,"Alpha containers need to be changed.

My suggestion is that anything you load in with that isn't removed throughout a raid, such as keys, should remain intact if things turn out to be unsuccessful for you. 

Anything that you acquire, or take out of the container, after loading in should be removed, just like everything else.

As it currently stands, a quarter to a half of the people in the raids I go to have hit up their spot and committed suicide or died naked trying to get there.

People are actually writing guides, or bragging about exploiting this ingenious way of getting rich by playing the game as little as possible and in such a way that you are actually not risking anything at all.  That doesn't make sense, not to mention that it encourages an inflated market. It's bad economics.

It's very annoying to meticulously make your way to your target area and find that it's already been looted--- by the naked dead guy lying right next to the group of scavs protecting this place that you just fought across an entire map to get to.

The other thing this mechanic encourages is dead scav matches. It's no fun when you load in less than 10 minutes into a game and everything is already dead. And not dead as in there's been a brutal firefight. It's dead as in dead. Not a single gun shot to be heard anywhere, no dead PMCs, very few dead scavs. Nothing but the sound of the wind and your own footsteps and an occasional Russian slur.",11,1585223462,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fpa6uk/change_alpha_containers/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fp9umg,CossDeLaVita,How does this work?,"Hi everyone. I have just one question about servers and maybe someone can answer it.  
I am from Russian and i dont like play Russian servers. I like European servers they have good ping for me and good ingame community. When i played Russian servers i watched a lot of server lags. By server lags i mean the situation when i fought a guy and then walked behind the wall and died behind the wall because server lagging and i still stay at old position on this guy monitor. Then i start trying play EU server and saw the same situation.   
I also found a way how you can understand if the server lags. If you reload your magazines and after cant load/unload ammo its mean server lag(I have never seen this lag on USA servers, only lagging servers have this glitch).  
I noticed that every third RU/EU server is lagging.  
After all these torments and deaths, I decided to go to USA servers. After two weeks of daily playing for 8 hours on USA servers, I can say that approximately every 20 server is lagging.   
So my question is: Why Russian and European servers have lags but USA servers work good?  
Yes, I know that this question needs to be asked by Nikita, but maybe one of you knows the answer about this.

fp9s0d,NicknamePN,Decreasing the amount of cheaters would be easy,"It is just simple math, you buy an EOD and 1 Months cheat support 300$ +-.

1M roubles sell for about 1$, red labs keycard for up to 30 and so on...

With the Eod starter gear, a gamma and some little software help you can easily farm stuff worth double in maybe two days work.

That's 300$ right there in two days, for sb like a student stuck at home or for the weekend thats a nice little side hustle, so no wonder people are doing that.

My proposal: make bulk sell and buy restricted, this way its way harder for boters and cheaters to make easy money to sell on the side, thus relaxing the vendor and black market situation for everyone and taking them the base line of their income.

Second: make Items which are currently worth a lot of real money bound to the person they found, if you buy thicc cases, and can resell them for 15$ restricting sales wont help, but if they are then bound to your account its not worth it anymore, same with keycards and keys. This way, if you find one, you can still go in with your buddy and open for him, but you cant sell it for $.

If they would keep that up, software providers would lose customers, ergo loose interest in developing software for the game, so you for one stopped people from gaining something from using 3rd party items and also dried up the supply of available software.

I don't play tarkov that resent anymore, bc of my work schedule and I just don't enjoy  it that much anymore personally, but right now, you guy have to stand up for the game you love, its pretty clear, that banning accounts and the selling new  EOD accounts (which are just limited available haha, good joke) is a sweet little side income, which wont be stopped, if people don't force them to. 

You have to understand, that right now, you as a normal player who bought eft a year or so ago and played since then is financially not as attractive as cheaters and players buying of cheaters for them, and they seem to not have a problem with going down this path, but you as a customer have to stand up for yourself and demand what is owed to you and what you paid for, which is at least a relative cheat free beta experience.

Air Filtering Unit Lvl 1\*\*\*

Generator Lvl 3

Water Collector Lvl 3

Booze Generator Lvl 1\*\*\*

Rest Space Lvl 3

Library Lvl 1\*\*\*

Intelligence Center Lvl 2

Solar Power Lvl 1\*\*\*

Bitcoin Farm Lvl 2

&amp;#x200B;

Come on now! I just hit level 30 and I ran straight to my hideout just knowing that I was going to be able to upgrade the heck out of it but the sickening feeling hit me when I realized literally ALL of my hideout upgrades (aside from workshop LVL 3) are locked behind my lack of strength level 3. I have run probably DOZENS of raids since the skill reset, Of which a great percentage of I have successfully extracted from. Not to mention I literally go into the raid already overweight (I carry an empty metal fuel container or two in my backpack) so I should be ""gaining"" strength skill right off the rip. 

Plus, I have thrown a LOT of COMPLETELY pointless grenades!!!! I have even been killed several times and lost all of my gear/loot because I was just chucking pointless grenades and drew attention I wouldn't have if it weren't for my desperate attempts to level strength.  

My strength as it stands now is just barely over level 1 and my endurance is level 4.5... Shouldn't they roughly level side by side?!?!?

Please just fix this already. At this rate, it will literally be months before I hit level 3 and I have been playing a LOT. I don't even want to imagine how long it would take for somebody who can't play 10-12+ hours a day like I have been for the past two weeks due to being quarantined. Honestly, it's probably been more like 14-16 hours a day for me lately.  It's basically unachievable for somebody that can only play for a few hours a day. 

If you want to make strength level slow as heck after hitting level 3 I am totally good with that. Maybe just remove the strength requirement for the air filtering unit so we can achieve that sooner for the skill boost??? Either way, strength leveling is obviously broken. Broken badly. Broken like trying to drive a car with only three out of four wheels on it. 

Please, please, PLEASE make the better parts of the hideout at least achievable for average game time players!!!!

I made sure to only put in 7K these last times because I didn't want to lose any more than I had to.

However I believe that we as a community have no power over developmental decisions at BSG, but we can suggest improvements through thoughtful discussion. Personally I would love to see skills tied to level and as you level up you can put levels into each category, so perhaps I am level 24, I decide to put 12 points into endurance and 2 points into perception and 10 points into strength. This is more streamlined, logical, and rewarding.

fp7ohm,tezudyos,Solution for everyone in general about skills.,"Now we all know here, or for most anyways, that BSG has stated, long ago, that the current skills bonuses, are just presets for now until they figure out what they actually want the skills to do. BUT, no matter what, in any games with skills, theres ALWAYS the that good portion of % of people, who want to level them up. If skills are in a game, well, its obvious, that they should be leveled. But when you have so many people complaining about cheeser's, because they INTENTIONALLY, made like what, i think 5? skills are utter broken and op as fuck? Icr, but the easiest solution for everyone, AND BSG themselves, so they have ONE less issue to work with until a WAY later date, is to soft lock/lock skills, primarily end,str,RC(?), and some others, and just SET them at a flat rate, for everyone, at like lets say level 15. WITH IT, remove the bonus from strength of being able to run faster so that hatchlings just cant run EVEN faster than people wearing gear. It takes care of skills, and lets them not worry about them until after. No matter the game, as long as theres skills, they will be leveled, whether the means of leveling is from cheesing, geniune leveling, or both. But when you make skills, especially str for whatever reason take a literal CENTURY to actually level, theres an issue. just lock them. Maybe make like a gym in your Fortress to help level them up x amount with a day cap of whatever.",4,1585209768,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fp7ohm/solution_for_everyone_in_general_about_skills/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fp67wp,BrotherNuclearOption,Some napkin math about the current pace of skill levelling,"Let's take Strength as an example.

Levelling a skill to elite requires 4650 skills points (skill level x 10 up to level 9, 100 points from levels 10 to 51). Skill exhaustion seems to limit per raid gains to ~3 points. ^(may be different for other skills?)

That works out to a minimum of **1,550 raids** to level a skill to elite, assuming you get the full 3 points each and every raid.

If you went out intending to grind the skill (ex: throw a bag full of grenades, suicide), you would be looking an absolute minimum of about 5 minutes per run (queuing, throwing, dying and reloading) or about **130 hours** of dedicated grinding. That's 3 work weeks.

If you play more organically while still consistently bagging those 3 points, say an average turn around of 20 minutes (raid+queuing), that threshold balloons to a little over 500 hours.

Realistically, both of those numbers would be far higher. Few players are entering every raid overweight and/or throwing a few 100k worth of grenades. In the nearly 200 hours I put in before the strength and endurance reset, I had hardly reached level 1.

I may have screwed up my math somewhere- please correct me if so- but my end conclusion is that the entire skill system is functionally irrelevant to almost the entire player base. Without the numbers on hours played it's just a guess but, with the current system, I would wager well under 0.1% of the player base will ever earn a single elite skill naturally",38,1585201804,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fp67wp/some_napkin_math_about_the_current_pace_of_skill/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I’ve owned this game since .10 and used to play with one of my buddies who sadly stopped playing a little after I got it. Was a bummer because playing with friends in this game is such a blast. Whether you’re tactically moving through a building clearing corners or yelling “cheeki breeki” at each other while running around aimlessly as a scav. So sad to say I was left to my own accords trying to learn such an unforgiving game for a poor soul like me at the time. I constantly told friends about the game saying “it’s next level fun, you have to get it”. Well I find myself here on patch 0.12.4 with many friends finally playing this game. Going from rat runs to chad bois. Crouching our way through buildings and running to dorms on customs for the hopes of the sweet sweet action and loot to come. Whether we die immediately or extract with the riches, we have fun nonetheless. Which is something I’ve been craving since I started. Having good, not so clean, cheeki breeki fun with my buds. In the end, my love for this game has grown immensely.

fp5zlm,Mezumoti,Why is everyone such a coward,"Ive had this game since September and it was great up until the last few months, I can handle server issues, bugs, aimboting AI, balance issues, but what I cant stand is the current gameplay META from the community.

I do most of my runs on reserve, I did 14 runs today. I killed 31 PMC's, and 2 of them had more gear than just a pistol or whatever gun was in marked room. 2... out of 31. This is just fucked, the worst part is im lvl 38 and well over half of my PMC kills on hatchet noobs were over lvl 40. What is wrong with people? 

The meta is ""sprint to valuable loot and put in in ur butt and fight pistol pussies"", all the decent loot is gone within a minute and extracted in 5mins, lets not pretend its anything but that. I like to take decent gear and take it a bit slow. whenever I do that I find NO loot, and I end up killing scavs all game hoping for a key card. 

I dont get it, whats appealing about hatchet running? I make plenty of money just playing the game and I havnt upgraded my hideout past shooting range. Why do people do this? Why do lvl 40+ do this ffs, in 40 levels have you not found out how to play well enough to profit off runs?

I just wanna get into the fights I got into when I first got the game, now everyone's just collecting pixels that are going to wiped anyways, why not just play the game normally, get better, and become loaded next wipe?? Ive lost most motivation to play, I think im gonna take a break until the devs figure this out because its just not the same anymore

fp5ar0,Hokucho,I... Refuse... To DIE!,"So! All in all I've had a really rough day today overall. I thought this was going to add to it. Boy was I wrong.  


Started a morning run on Reserve. I was kinda sour as I had just come off of a bad PMC and SCAV run (sub 1 minute runs) and spawned by White Knight. I had been using this area for equipment pickups to sell and to maybe, just maybe see Gluhar from a distance after hunting him for more than a week (almost 2 now) while I am doing so.  


I go into the RB-ST room and hear footsteps so I hold the door angle for a bit hoping they don't come inside. Thankfully, they do not. Just to be safe I slow crouch my way around and pick up some gear, nothing special, but money is money. This whole time I've been hearing occasional gunfire and LOTS of angry SCAVs. I don't want to get caught in the crossfire so I sprint my way through the building and hide behind the black crate in the adjoining room. Noone is coming after me. That said, I hear grenade clinks, and see flashes on the other side of the wall. They aren't directed at me. I sit in that corner, hoping the guy in the room next to me would bail and run straight into me while he was distracted by the SCAVs.  


Quite the opposite.  


My curiosity gets the better of me and I step out to peek the hole in the wall. That pissed off a SCAV. I duck back, thinking my cover was blown. Unexpectedly I hear sprinting, not from the building near me, but from the place I was just shot at from.  


It wasn't a SCAV.   


I find out afterwards, the guy that pushed me was one of Gluhar's guards. I tell the AI is geared, and I freak out. Thankfully, I had a decked VSS at the time and I was able to chew his armor and I suffer little more than a blacked arm. Instinctively, I sprint back to the other side of the building. I patch the bleeding, and wait. By now I'm expecting to get jumped. A few minutes pass, more gunfire, further off this time, but loud. Snipers I'm thinking. I'm not willing to risk it. I wait a couple more minutes.  


I hear nothing but angry SCAVs, so I chance it finally, and step into White Knight proper. I check the bathroom first, no noise. As I am about to turn the corner that sees the stairs, I see a huge red dot of death on the wall. The guy is waiting for me and holding that angle. Thankfully, it was one of the few times I took 6 grenades with me. I chuck one and bang.  


No reaction at all. Which was odd. The dot is lined up in a way I'm not sure how that grenade didn't work. I breathe in, ready to die, and pop the corner prefiring. Wasted ammo.  


A body lies there in a crumpled heap. The gun pointing with its laser still on. This man was dead already. And I didn't do it. I calm down, but only slightly. There are still angry boyes all around. I huddle into the room he fell out of, and check his stuff. An AK I cant fit right now, a chonky MP5, and some meds and other knick nackery. I swipe his tags and drink down his juice for metabolism boosts. I shouldn't have done that I find out later. As soon as I finish chugging that Pineapple juice, I hear clonks. I think it's the SCAVs finally pathing towards me so I dive deeper into the room. One gets gunned down as it walks past a window. Then there's more. I hear bullets hitting metal, and I can't see, but I can hear.  


I go prone under the windowsill for a second. I have three grenades left. I think I hear steps in front of me (audio being weird and all that) and I chuck a grenade out the door frame. No joy, so they're behind me still. Unable to see, I throw two grenades into the blown out wall and shoot a couple small bursts. I later find the man slumped against thew truck and support beam of the building, bullet holes riddling the truck.  


I killed a man I couldn't even see.  


Thinking I am in the clear, I head up the stairs and loot the gear room upstairs. More footsteps. More angry people. At this point the raid is about 20 minutes left. I wonder what the likelihood is of running into actual players. These must be more SCAVs.  


I walk down the stairs and hold the bottom for a second before popping out and gunning the man in the hallway down. I paid for it though. Arm and legs are blacked. I hear a second set of steps. I'm in no condition to fight so I sprint back upstairs, my PMC grunting in pain as I run on adrenaline'd limbs.   


I dive into the gear room and shut the door, hoping I can stall with them not knowing below which room I am in as I hide behind the table. I use the last of the charges on the CMS kit I have. Left arm is at 19HP, but everything else is okay. I have more than enough meds.  


I repeat what I had done before. Hold the stairs, peek, and shoot.  


Noone there.  


I am panicking a bit now. I know I'm not alone and I am running out of ammunition and medicine. I duck into the toilets and wait. I should mention I had ditched almost all of my gear I was using at the start of the raid at this point for fear of losing my kit. I have the AKMS I looted from the RB room earliar, and the MP5. Footsteps again.  


My vision blurs to hell as I get hit over and over again. I unload at near point-blank range into the guy. he falls. I don't.  


 &lt;a title=""Everything Hurts"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/yojzhfv.png""&gt;Everything Hurts&lt;/a&gt;  . My arm and legs are all blacked now. head, torso, and stomach are messed up. Even my stomach is popped. I use the last of my recoverable meds to heal up what I can. Then the worst thing happens.  


Even. More. Footsteps.  


A PMC sidesteps into the room, having most likely come to Hyena-Up the leftover loot and pick any survivors (aka Me) off.  


I take more shots. The guy is using inferior ammo or the 2-3 second exchange of gunfire we split would have ended much sooner. He hits the ground hard. I almost follow suit.   &lt;a title=""My Body Burns In Agony"" href=""https://i.imgur.com/7JoVYzd.png""&gt;My Body Burns In Agony&lt;/a&gt;  .  


I also start to see black. I am out of energy. I am desperate. The timer has less than 10 minutes left and I need to move. If I run, I have the very high chance of dying. I am able to save myself from dying of bloodloss both of these times, and that's it. Desperate, i scramble-search every body in the building. I even find two more souls that perished from the initial gunfire I evidently heard before. It saves my life.  


The unknown corpses have a CMS kit with 1 charge left. I pop it on my stomach and continue to search while I heal. Bless the gods.  


Crackers. The man had a pack of crackers and a thing of apple juice with 17/40 durability left. My body still hurts though. I'm not sure of my odds. There are still SCAVs, and I still cant risk running. The 2nd unidentified body has a full IFAK. That will get what parts I have left back up to full. I might, MIGHT, make it.   


7 minutes left.  


I bite the bullet and start walking. I peek through the doors of the buildings I had become all to familiar with at this point, and notice a SCAV walking past each time I look. I cant risk staying and fighting. I know I take too long to line up shots and the SCAVs  normally see me as I am doing so. My RIG is still above half, but limb damage I cant risk. I run for it.  


My PMC grunts in pain as I sprint from the buildings, past the holes in the fence towards dome. I don't stop to hide and heal. if things go wrong I wont have time if I do. I pop a Painkiller to be safe, despite the hydration and energy risk. I walk my hobbled, broken, bloodied, and beaten body up the hill, and towards the trees behind Dome. I go prone, moreso because now I am more in character at this point. My PMC, and i, are exhausted. i scream some randomly bound keybind in Russian as I EXFIL.  


I had a little over 3 minutes left in raid.

fp3e24,ErDanese,A shout out for in game voice system,"I've been playing tonight with two old friends I play tarkov with, on star citizen to test it out, and we went without discord using the in game voice comms. It was a blast! First, the party comms is the radio, used for ship to ship comm and when far a part. We went on mission were we fought some ships away and radio comms were normal, good shit but next phase was to assoult a big ship on foot, infiltrating it jumping e.v.a. and switched to local voice after the airlock using our tarkov's experience covering each other and clearing room after room. Hearing your mate with the natural reverb of the material that the room is made of and having it coming from back or left/right as it should happen totally changes the experience. It was absolutely awesome. A plus was the fact that while on a station the local works also with randoms encountered, while chatting people stopped by to listen to us, speaking in Italian. I personally want voip in the game, I want to hear my mate making callous from my side and I want so that an enemy on the second floor of dorms can hear a faint voice from below like when I'm playing airsoft., that is only a plus for the immersion.

fp376z,WhiskeyTreatz,Scavs or players being invisible for you.,"Hello, Ive had an issue these past 2 days where my guy drops dead without any gunshots, 0 audio, nothing. 

So yesterday the first time this happened to me, I thought I got shot from faraway by a silencer, you're supposed to hear the crack of the bullet still, but I didn't. Turns out my friend killed him and apparently he was right behind me with a hunter. I never heard or saw him. 

Just now after I killed a player on interchange near the front of idea, 2 seconds later I drop dead, same thing no audio or gunshot. This time to a scav! Shot me in my face, and its unusual that the scav landed a headshot first bullet, or unless he was shooting me the whole time and I had no idea. I wasn't taking any damage both deaths. 

So I'm wondering if these people are desynced somewhere on the map for me. And they just walk around invisible until they kill me. Anybody else had this issue?

fp2kau,Kraall,Counter-skill system,"So I think most of us agree that the skill system has issues, it's both too easy and too enticing to cheese/exploit skills and the nerfs that have been implemented to counter this have hurt normal players more than the exploiters. I know some people want the skill system removed because of this but the devs clearly want one, so I've been thinking about how system can be reworked to be both (relatively) realistic and balanced.

**Counter skills**

My idea is for every skill to have 'counter skills', where as you progress a skill the counter skill(s) will potentially lose points, maintaining a balanced level and making skills a reflection of a players style rather than something to be maxed out.

**Strength**

As an example, the strength skill could be countered by the endurance and covert movement skills. Max your strength skill through cheesing/exploiting and your endurance and covert movement drop really low, making you lose stamina quickly and make a ton of noise when moving. This would also mean that if someone does max strength, when they start playing normally and progressing their other skills their strength would degrade over time, until it reaches a level more representative of its use. This would also mean you can't combine max strength/endurance, which is a pretty overpowered combo.

**General play**

Another example would be weapon skills. Each weapon class (Assault Rifle, DMR, SMG, etc) could be countered by all other weapon classes. So someone who runs nothing but assault rifles would be able to max that skill while someone who mostly pistol runs would level their pistol. This would introduce a cost to doing low gear money runs, as your rifle skills would degrade if you don't use them regularly, rewarding players who regularly risk gear by allowing them to hone the skills relevant to that gear. Of course if you're committed to running a pistol then that's not a negative, you can quickly level pistols/endurance/covert movement and become the ninja/Sam Fisher you've always wanted to be.

**Progression**

To maintain some kind of progression in the system, all skills could initially start at zero and progress as normal, but as their levels begin to increase progression starts to favour the skills that are being utilised more. This would allow skills like strength and endurance to level quickly at first without hindering each other, but as both start to reach the higher levels they would start to balance out, with the more frequently used skill eventually settling at a higher level. Another option would be for all skills to start at level 25 or so and then increase/decrease to match a players style, but obviously this would require some quest/hideout changes.

fp1p8s,Ahaghrar,Lucky Last Raid part.1," 

So it was my last raid of the day. As trying to make the game fun at the end, especially after a bad day in Tarkov I try some random loadout (copying SCAV mostly)  
So start loadout: PACA, PP-91 KEDR with a silencer and added 2 vog-25  
Map: Custom  
As I spawned in the boiler area, I went to the substation area to find something valuable or player. After quick loot at the substation, I heard some gun (AK's) in the direction of Dorms. Fast decision Let's go!

In the back of the bus station, I heard the single sound of the suppressed gun (not typical) from the Factory Area.  
Decided to activated semi sneak mode, I get as close as I could and them, one mistake was made by enemy, loud step on metal. I knew someone is in a metal container in a factory area.  
Pressed G and prayed to get him.  
The grenade was successful (i got quest complete confirmation)

The sweetest part: Found in 5 bodies.  
3 middle geared player and 2 players, who were making Setup quest.  
Looted everything that was most valuable for me and of course the KEK TAPE  
I went straight to the exit.

fp1nc2,Spiili,Vertical Sound: A Major Problem Nobody is Talking About,"Everyone knows hackers and the strength/endurance exploit are a big deal right now but I haven't seen many people talking about the vertical sound issues currently in tarkov.

If you aren't aware or don't exactly run to dorms/rescort looking for fights you may not be aware that vertical sound is currently bugged and has been for a while. A decent example can be found in kotton's latest video at this timestamp: https://youtu.be/ubNQQpPEM5I?t=153

As it stands in tarkov currently if you are inside a building you can hear upwards but not below you. This has probably lead to you getting snuck up on a lot on dorms or resort and has completely killed all the fun of rushing resort looking for PVP. 

If you're above a player in dorms for example you can hear the following beneath you: Healing, shooting,  the fire escape and bushes. You can NOT hear someone walking or sprinting on the floor or gravel outside. This can be heavily abused on resort for example because you can sprint all the way to the bottom of the stairs and start walking before you get halfway up and the person above you will never hear you. This has forced me and my duo to leave one of us on the bottom just to play ""ears bitch"" so that we still have an advantage.

I'm completely bored with tarkov at the moment, all I do anymore is run around geared to the teeth looking for PVP. This current bug has made playing Shoreline more boring than it was before and even effects maps like Interchange (upstairs), Reserve (Pawn buildings etc), and customs (dorms) in less obvious ways. At least if they fix this PVP might wind up being a little more dynamic than ""dont hit the bushes on the way to dorms and you'll surprise anyone inside""",10,1585182358,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fp1nc2/vertical_sound_a_major_problem_nobody_is_talking/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fp1et9,ATMisboss,Some of my ideas regarding loot and new weight system,"I have been thinking of ways to fix certain issues the community has in the game. 

1)The ""hatchling"" problem: My idea regarding this is that because people are angry about all the loot on maps being gobbled up by hatchlings and stuffed in secure containers, dogtags should be reworked. Dogtag value could be changed to scale with the value of items added to the secure container of the player that raid as well as level.

Ex: Say you kill a hatchling that had made it to drop down room on reserve and had gotten two graphics cards into their container. You could get a dogtag valued at 1/4 of the value of the items added that raid. 500000/4 = 125000 + level bonus.

This would ease the anger of players who want to make money running with a group and not rushing to major loot locations. By making it only the value of items found in that raid we could eliminate exploitability of this mechanic. It would also have to be loot that was generated that raid so we would not have people bringing red keycards and dropping them to their friend to then kill them and profit. I know that it does not solve the problem people have with wanting a real fight but it would allow those players to make money off killing the hatchlings.

2)The new weight system: currently many people dislike this system because of the daunting grind it presents and the fact that it does not allow them to get everything off of their kills due to it making them an easy target. Also this system makes it so that the loot that people have gained already this wipe can be used but makes it very hard to use that gear and gain money because of the fact that their gear alone could be putting them near that weight threshold at the start of the raid. I understand that this is done in the name of realism but it feels too unrewarding until one has progressed further in their skill leveling. Leveling itself is also a massive grind and seems to reward cheeses and glitches more than the average player not doing these farms. 

My idea is that if the leveling of skills was tied to the leveling of the PMC it would make it so that people who have leveled up this wipe would be able to use their stuff they have earned with less of a penalty. Also if this system went into place what would have to be done is that the skills would have to level up to 100. To make the grind feel rewarding elite perks could be divided into tiers with tier 1 being at PMC level 25 tier 2 being at PMC level 50 tier 3 being at PMC level 75 and tier 4 being at PMC level 100.

Ex: A player has reached level 25 and unlocked the tier 1 elite perk for strength. This perk makes it so that the weight of their weapon is not counted towards weight penalties. The player then reaches level 50 and unlocked the tier 2 elite perk for strength causing the weight of their secure container is not counted against weight penalties. The same player reaches level 75 and unlocks the tier 3 elite perk for strength causing the weight of their armor to not be counted against weight penalties. The player finally reaches level 100 unlocking the 4th and final tier of the strength elite perk which reduces the effective weight of all items by 25%.

This system would not only allow for people who this wipe have earned gear be able to use it but it incentivizes play centered on killing players and scavs for experience rather than running to loot spots in the hunt for roubles. This will fix the issues with the lack of pvp that content creators as well as the ""chads"" of the community crave.

Those are my thoughts on two of the most controversial things in tarkov right now.

fp18xl,RealParallax,Do you have 209250 minutes or 3487 Hours?,"First off , yes I cheesed my skills and played with max strength and endurance, and I'd like to give my perspective on tarkov as a game or 'simulator' as you all seem to call it. 

A little background about myself;

I began playing tarkov on January 4 2020. Since then, I've gotten 3876 kills, 1231 of those are PMCs, I retain a mediocre 44% survival rate, have Kappa, and the Killa Tracksuit, and have played 1398 raids so far. I'm sitting on a 6.28 KDR and it's rising steadily. I haven't played this game long, but when I began playing there was no weight system in place to prevent ""mass looting"" or ""over looting"" as some players call it. With the changes around March 12th, it changed the game entirely for players like myself. By that time I had already been rising in SR and KDR, and making a lot of money. 70m Liquid and 160m in stash (no red keycards found). 

So a few weeks ago, if I recall correctly BSG reset everyone's skills with the new weight system on March 12th. This was a terrible idea from the start, but some seem to like it and some seem to hate it. I could be biased, but I dislike the change entirely. It's very punishing to players who end up getting 2-3 or more kills a raid, and leaves a lot of room for undergeared players and player scavs to come in and just take weapons and left overs and make a lot of money without doing anything. When I first started playing and I killed a 3+ man I was excited, the weight system didn't exist then. I was hyped and had adrenaline in my system and was just mindblown about the looting and how to do it. I learned quickly how to min-max and make the most money from each raid I played. When the changes came around they made it quite difficult to be happy about wiping a big group, everyone talking about comitting insurance fraud, but for a player like myself, dumping my gear and good ammo isn't ideal to take lesser gear. Plus looting as much as I can from my kills is essential to making money and staying on top of the food chain in tarkov. What's the point of running good ammo if I'm not bringing out any profit to pay for the ammo I spent in raid? Also to pay for new armor, or meds and such. While I don't have a lot to worry about with my stash, consider that for OTHER players and players who are averaging 1 kill a game, or a lower SR. 

I thought a lot about this and went and did the math with the new system. Supposedly you can level strength by WALKING at 40kg+ with the tweaked system, but even then, it's insanely lackluster. Reminder, I have 1398 raids, with 1k hours in about 80 days.

If you load out with a 40kg gearset every raid, it may take you 209,250 minutes, which is 3487 hours to get to ELITE strength. That doesn't level when you're sprinting or jumping or doing other things. You would have to WALK only in order to get these hours, so we can safely assume it would take longer.

&amp;#x200B;

Points per 1km \~ 1.0 (I've seen or read)

Leveling points needed per level:

LV 1 - 10

&amp;#x200B;

LV 2 - 20

&amp;#x200B;

LV 3 - 30

&amp;#x200B;

LV 4 - 40

&amp;#x200B;

LV 5 - 50

&amp;#x200B;

LV 6 - 60

&amp;#x200B;

LV 7 - 70

&amp;#x200B;

LV 8 - 80

&amp;#x200B;

LV 9 - 90

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------- 450km @ 40kg to reach LV 10

&amp;#x200B;

LV 10-51 - 100/lv (4100 Points or 4100km to reach ELITE)

&amp;#x200B;

Walk 4650km @ 40kg+ to get ELITE

&amp;#x200B;

4650 Raids to get Elite @ 1km 40kg WALKING | 209250 Minutes or 3487 Hours

&amp;#x200B;

2325 Raids to get Elite @ 2km 40kg WALKING | 104625 Minutes or 1743.75 Hours

&amp;#x200B;

1550 Raids to get Elite @ 3km 40kg WALKING | 69750 Minutes or 1162.5 Hours

&amp;#x200B;

So in essence, it takes 3487 hours to level it to ELITE by ONLY walking with 40+ KG, assuming you play raids that are 45 minutes long, from start to finish. This doesn't include playing shorter raids, or dying, or time spent sprinting and looting / healting etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with this system is that is UNREALISTIC. I've played this game for 1k hours already, and I can safely say that most casual players will not even put 300+ hours into this game, assuming they have work, school, or other things to tend to then sitting at their pc playing a 'simulator'.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'll admit, at one point I had cheesed my skills to max, and it completely changed the game, and you could tell how many players were doing it too. The weight system is too punishing for players getting many kills and promotes extract camping, and leaving behind loot, and such. Killing Gluhar and his guards or Rashala and his guards isn't even exciting any more as you can't walk out feeling accomplished taking all that loot. It makes it harder for poorer players to make major bank after wiping a team, and makes it harder for richer players to enjoy taking out the gear sets they want. Now I've heard the argument, if you're gonna go out like a ""tank"" then you should be slow. The deal is, there is no ""tank"" in tarkov. There is ALWAYS a bullet that can penetrate or kill you no matter what armor / helmet you're wearing. It's a videogame, let players run what gear they want, and have fun with it. As a competitive player I've died many of times with expensive gearsets, and it only helps the lesser fortunate players make money.

Times are tough they put 50 uses on the key  

Me and the boys were getting angsty 100% guaranteed  

We said fuck it and grabbed a junkbox and filled it up

This s\*\*\* was like second nature to us we was stackin chips  

One of our boys brought a thicc case, died and took a hit  

Low risk high reward we started going in with full  juice

fp136b,Ahaghrar,Lucky Last Raid pt.1,"So it was my last raid of the day. As trying to make the game fun at the end, especially after a bad day in Tarkov I try some random loadout (copying  SCAV  mostly)  
So start loadout: PACA, PP-91 KEDR with a silencer and added 2 vog-25   
Map: Custom  
As I spawned in the boiler area, I went to the substation area to find something valuable or player. After quick loot at the substation, I heard some gun (AK's) in the direction of Dorms. Fast decision Let's go!

In the back of the bus station, I heard the single sound of the suppressed gun (not typical) from the Factory Area.   
Decided to activated semi sneak mode, I get as close as I could and them, one mistake was made by enemy, loud step on metal. I knew someone is in a metal container in a factory area.   
Pressed G and prayed to get him.  
The grenade was successful (i got quest complete confirmation)  


The sweetest part: Found in 5 bodies.   
3 middle geared player and 2 players, who were making Setup quest.  
Looted everything that was most valuable for me and of course the KEK TAPE   
I went straight to the exit.

&amp;#x200B;

In the video you can see the Raider tanked like 15 shots but in the end it only says 7 hits in total raid, which was the bullets he used for killing the players and raider before the last one.

It seems it happens more often with the Val, but it has been confirmed with .556 rounds as well.

So, if sometimes you felt like the guy tanked way too many bullets before killing you, you were probably not firing a single one.",4,1585177987,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fp0g6y/gamebreaking_bug_that_has_been_going_on_for_a/,EscapefromTarkov,1

BS will announce that they are impelementing a new cool feature/fix and instantly there are idiots commenting ""dur dur now fix desync and servers"" or ""I better get compensation for this"" and my personal favourite (after a recent patch was implemented causing a slight delay to offline period) ""my class finishes in 45 mins, have servers fixed by then thanks"" 

There is no appreciation for the fact that they are actively listening to the community (lowering flea market gate to 10, changing overweight amount etc.)  and making changes/fixing the majority of critical bugs promptly.

Honestly if I was BState I would be so sick of how toxic (apologies for the buzzword) the community behaves towards them. Such entitlement. Its great when I see people comment positively saying that BS should take their time to get it right, and to keep up to good work.

If you are one of these people, please think about the effect this has on morale at BState. By polluting their feed with negativity you are a part of the problem. God forbid we have another DayZ type situation on our hands where the game is more or less abandoned and the team move on to something else.

We started over at the east corner bunkers area, moved over to the bishop garages and buildings.

foxuqq,IMBOBGETUSEDTOIT,Strength and Endurance Glitching,"Strength and Endurance glitching is without a doubt, the most abused glitch in EFT and honestly, its no mystery as to why. To put it simply, **THE MAX LEVEL PERKS ARE EXTREMELY OVER POWERED.** This is also no mystery. Countless players, for as long as the game has existed, have been posting articles, how to videos and guides on how you can most efficiently boost your stats so you can take full advantage of the perks given to those who hold the max level skills. 

Almost exactly 2 years ago, the map interchange was released bringing along with it a game breaking bug that would allow players to artificially boost their skills to max strength and endurance by falling out of the map. Ever since then, its been wide spread for the community to find new ways to glitch the skills as Battle State  patches the old ways. Battle State have ever since been adjusting, patching and changing the way people get strength and endurance and yet, years after the glitches have been discovered, **PEOPLE ARE STILL EASILY ABLE TO GLITCH THEIR STATS.**

Enough of the history, lets discuss solutions.

In the most recent patch, Battle State reset those who glitched their stats  proving the have the ability to monitor each individual stat of each player (duh). This being the case, I don't see why they shouldn't also be able to monitor the rate at which skill points are gained.

What's my point? have a bot or a program periodically scan the skills of players, maybe one ever few hours or once a day. Battle state knows that the goal for skills is for them to take years to max out. If the level of a players skill spikes above what they deem normal, it should be blatantly clear what that player did to gain those skill points. When the players account is flagged, reset their skill points to what they were at the previous scan cycle.

foxg4w,Bomjus1,does the 7.62 MDR ever feel worth it at ~1200 USD? stats:investment ratio issue?,"let's just go through the prices of some weapons real quick.

7.62 MDR - 152k roubles 1227 USD (currently)

5.56 MDR - 85k roubles 690 USD 50k on the flea

m1a - 50k on the flea. 16k-40k depending on USB adapter trade to peacekeeper

sa-58 - 50k on the flea. 4 nixxor's to mechanic level 4. sell the suppressor and the gun is paid for.

m4 - ~50k on flea. trade prokill to mechanic for ~125k m4. sell attachments for profit and make gun from that. 

almost all of these builds with BiS attachments and a 4x cost around 200-350k (trades make it a lot cheaper). except the 7.62 MDR has the worst recoil out of all of them. while still having that incredibly high price tag. and i think most people will agree that ~80 ergonomics does not make up for having 90 recoil on a 200k+ gun. 90 recoil is like a budget m1a build. 

i think the biggest problem is the complete lack of barter trades. the usb barter trade, sa-58 barter trade(s), sa-58 spawning on scavs, and m4's constantly being found as random spawns means these guns are far more prevalent. driving the price down significantly. i don't know the exact reason why the 5.56 one is so cheap, but i would hazard a guess that the popularity and accessibility of the m4, adar, and HK drives the price of the 5.56 MDR down substantially.

i really enjoy using this gun. even at 90 recoil. but i feel like i am intentionally screwing myself when i could be using a 50 recoil (or less) m1a for the same price. as for CQC, a 16 inch m1a barrel will still have ~20+ less recoil than the MDR and be completely serviceable in close range. and can support more than a 20 round mag (which idc about mag options, i take the 20 regardless. but this adds to the CQC argument). 

just to end this, i LOVE the MDR. it is such a cool looking gun and there's feeling i can't articulate when holding such a dangerous weapon in such a small package. however, in a game all about maximizing the roubles, it falls SO flat compared to the other 7.62 options. while the 5.56 MDR sits in a great spot because it is dirt cheap compared to a fully kitted m4.

and idk what the best way would be to make it more #worth. it's hard to balance it because a recoil reduction would make it outclass the 5.56 MDR (especially without expensive m995 is). adding a barter trade for both MDR's would go a long way in helping. reducing the price from ~1200 to 900-950 would also make it a lot more of a friendly choice to use. you trade the most important stat, recoil, for a cheaper weapon. i'm spitballing here. i just want to think ""goddamn, this gun is awesome, and super effective for it's price"" like what i think when i run an m1a.

i will say one thing, i guess BSG really nailed the realism of the MDR being expensive AF lol",15,1585167673,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/foxg4w/does_the_762_mdr_ever_feel_worth_it_at_1200_usd/,EscapefromTarkov,1

Ultimately, I have around 1,000 hours and this is my 4th wipe. I've never, ever, not once,  been killed by someone and thought to myself, ""I'm sure they strength exploited and that's why I died.""

Honestly people are always going to find cheeses so how about you stop focusing on that and fix the actual game. You can get into more than 2 raids without running into a hacker it’s absurd. The stuttering is absolutely out of hand it’s a joke but instead of fixing that you reset strength levels like it’s going to do anything honestly how dumb can these people be. Today was the last time I’ll log onto this game they aren’t fixing anything they release new content that further breaks the game.

fovii7,Deletd_EFT,Customs should get a light rework,"As of now, Customs is just horribly unbalanced when it comes to spawns. And for a map that has a lot of early game quests, the balance is just horrid.

First of all, i am not all that new to the game. I do only have 2 wipes to my name, and most of my playtime has been spent on Customs and right now, interchange. But even as an interchange player, you know, the Mr. Shoots-A-Lot's home, i can say that Customs is just FILLED with shit choke points.

First of all, the spawns. Even now, on my second wipe, i can say that if you spawn on the crossroads side of the bridge, you are fucked. The spawns in that area are super close to each other, and the loot is even worse, even for Customs. Crossing the bridge to the other side is miles more dangerous than crossing it in the other direction. And the chokepoints you need to cross are a lot worse when going away from the bridge. 

I have noticed this now, as i have put the second prapor quest on hold and just now i have started actually doing it. I am over lvl 20 for fucks sake. But the thing is, getting the locket is so much easier is you spawn somewhere near Old Gas station, or at least on its side of the map. This is because of the shitty ass visibility and the horrid choke point.

If you are coming from the bridge towards the truck, the area is way worse. Because of the amount of vegetation around the place and the FUCKING sniper scav, seeing your enemy is almost impossible before you get shot in the head. The map isn't friendly to new players because of the spawns. If you spawned near old gas, getting the locket is easy as you can avoid the entire risk area. And as a bonus old gas can spawn almost anything so thats something right?

Rant over, i just needed to vent on my frustration on the amount of unbalance",4,1585161304,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fovii7/customs_should_get_a_light_rework/,EscapefromTarkov,1

fovg1h,SomnificOwl,"Thank You, But Don't Stop!","Feel free to give me shit for this, I'm not pretending what I did was something I'm proud of or endorse. 

Last night right before the servers went down for maintenance I cheesed my skills. I woke up to find they've wiped what seems like everyone who was max strength, and honestly I'm so fucking relieved.

 Not because I regret exploiting, though I regret being so blinded by frustration that I actually did it. I'm relieved that they're working against it. I don't believe I need to replay the broken record but my GOD elite levels are fundementally broken. For the raid I was able to play before it went down, I was running circles around people with a mosin, scrambling like a weasel to jump out and pop them. 

My time to me is precious, I work 40~ hours and love to play this when I can. Before weight changes I was legitimately trying to level strength, which is fun if not a bit mind numbing after a while. Then they wiped everyone's skills, okay fine, level playing field. 

First handful of woods raids were peppered here and there with Chads, bunnyhopping fully geared while I was waddling around because I had the fucking GALL to pick up an svd. It's been grinding at my good will towards the game for a while.

I accept the fact that other people can dedicate more time than me, and are just better overall players than I am. I'm average skill, on a good day.

I don't need loot or cash right now either. I've got 15 mil after purchasing a thicc weapon case. Two regular, one thicc weapon cases, all full, two icase of armor, a full icase of helmets, 995, BP 7.62, BS 5.45, and my inventory is still stuffed to the damned gills. I'm not bragging,I'm not flaunting this, plenty of people have more than me. 

I'm level 36, and I barely do quests at all. Hell I haven't even started ragman's quests since last night. I live and die by PvP.

So thanks for trying to curtail shitheads like myself and bastards who would do it regardless. I don't think players should be punished for investing time into the game, so please keep on it. I understand not all exploits can be fixed immediately, and I understand that we are still in beta, it's just been frustrating to no end lately. I love this game, I love this community for the most part, I want to see this game succeed. 

TL;DR: I won't call BSG perfect but I thank them for trying. I just hope they keep an ear to the ground. I'm also a shitter :/",9,1585161075,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fovg1h/thank_you_but_dont_stop/,EscapefromTarkov,1

foux8f,Western_Philosophy,Revert the scav buff,"It’s actually ridiculously annoying and frustrating playing and a scav without making any noise shoots you when there’s no way they should see you. Scavs are meant to be filler and not difficult before the actually player vs player fights. The scavs don’t have a “line of sight” that lets them detect you, it’s just if you’re in a certain radius of a scav, they no matter what will detect you and alert all the other scavs. Scavs never miss and even if you’re just walking through woods they won’t shout or even give the player a chance, they just start shooting and hardly ever miss with their insane aim and reflexes. It’s so incredibly unfun when there’s no way to possibly combat it if you’re in an unideal situation like in the woods where even with a shotgun with one shot they will somehow black out a leg.",16,1585159330,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/foux8f/revert_the_scav_buff/,EscapefromTarkov,1

I get killed with 1 or 2 shots in to thorax (most of my helmets come back form ensurance with 100% condition)

fou3xg,Wingklip,"Huge prone, crouch, walk toggling bug","Hey lads, I've been playing tarkov for an entire month now, but there's been an infuriating little bug that has truly screwed me in many situations where time was critical. I'd lost a thermal ak sniper duel to it, I'd given myself away on multiple occasions, I've also pissed my entire team off for 'not caps walking' when I literally pressed it a sec ago.

I'm not sure if anyone else has it, but every time I go in a game, the first time I go prone or walk, it always turns it right off after. And then every time after opening invent.

So every time I go prone it makes me unprone immediately. I've fiddled with the settings and nothing seems to change it. Is there a special way to solve this? And it also seems that double tapping prone before proning makes me unprone too. 

Absolutely impossible to prone during a fight because I'm scared of literally standing up while trying to stay down, losing a precious second of engagement time.

Wondering why ultra medical storage key is crashing even tho the loot inside is amazing compared to current price. I bought this key at 4.8mil and I'm not even mad that it dropped below 3mil. Ive made more than 4.8m from this key in under 10 uses.

You get opthalmoscope or two almost every time you go inside the room and those are 100k rubles each. Also few spawns for ledx and defibilator is quite common so very easily 200k-2m loot there.

Worst loot ive gotten was lil bit shy of 200k (only got stims and goldenstar)

in my opinion this key should be worth 5mil considering how good it is.",16,1585154204,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/fote8j/ultra_medical_storage_is_underrated/,EscapefromTarkov,1

What happened????? The new weight system is absolutely game breaking bad. I know its more realistic but we were just getting kills that we just couldnt loot because it would take an age to reach the bodies. We only had a couple of guns and helmets on us and we were at 75KG so overweight, and it felt horrible. Its just not fun(I know I know ""tarkov is not supposed to be fun"") but this is on a whole new level.

I'm really not trying to start and argument here and I do absolutely adore this game but it feels like I've met a women who's a 10/10 to get her home and find out she has a bigger D\*\*k than me.

I much much much preferred the game before this weight system was introduced and unfortunately it looks like at least me and my friends can't play with this system in it's current state. :(

fosvw5,ZestStory,"Quick-fix for locked ""leaving game"" screen.","Some people have reported encountering this issue within the last few days. I faced the same problem. It can be very annoying. It happened when I hit leave game right after I queued without insuring accidentally. I read a few old forum posts about it. Apparently this problem popped up over a year ago as well. But if this patch didn't get rid of it, here's a couple solutions. To reiterate, this is not my creativity at work here. I just dug through a few old forums posts and here's the result. So flame me if you like.

While some people have simply waited it out, for others that's not a possibility. This is what worked for me:

1. Alt-ctrl-delete
2. Close Tarkov
3. Clear cache
4. Check integrity
5. Restart computer, reboot BSG launcher.

9/10 you should be good to go. For some reason, while the few people who reported this fix didn't work for them, waiting five minutes to an hour did actually seemed to help.

Google results suggest this bug has been around for awhile. At least over a year?

for1ww,DaMonkfish,[Suggestion] Allow PMCs to 'hire' AI Scavs in order to use the PMC &amp; Scav extracts,"The extracts that require PMC &amp; Scav to use likely aren't used all that much as PMC and Scav are mortal enemies 99.9% of the time, and without an effective way for them to communicate the default of either is to divide the cheeks of the other. So, what about allowing the PMC to 'hire' an AI Scav in the same way a Player Scav can get an AI to follow them? This would then allow the PMCs to use the PMC/Scav combo extracts without trying to find that 0.1% of Player Scavs that isn't immediately going to try and take their head off.

I think it should work something like this:

- A new 'surrender' animation is added. When used, the PMC holsters/slings their weapon and puts both hands up in the air
- Before entering an area with scavs (perhaps before they have agro'd, haven't thought too hard about that part), the PMC puts their hands up and walks into the area
- All of the scavs get edgy and agitated and aim at the PMC but they don't immediately shoot. If the PMC draws their weapon, or another PMC shoots at or kills any of the scavs, all hell breaks loose.
- One Scav runs up to the PMC, perhaps shouting some amusing lines and waving their weapon around in their face aggressively
- The PMC offers the scav some cash (perhaps, say, 30-50k roubles), which the Scav gladly takes and then follows the PMC in the same way they would follow a Player Scav. When doing this the other Scavs on the map are not aggro'd to the PMC but are definitely agitated (same as they were in point 3). The Scav following the PMC doesn't shoot at other PMCs unless shot at, but perhaps gets nervous if he spots one
- The Scav will follow the PMC to the extract and when the PMC enters the extraction area, the Scav will join them and permit both to leave. The Scav should probably follow the PMC through the map, though perhaps there should be a time limit imposed before the Scav bails on you

You'll have to plan accordingly for food and water (or better yet, you are not allowed to bring food and water and have to scavenge it from the map)

The more equipment and armour you bring the faster you fatigue, and perhaps even stay permanently fatigued to half!

HIDEOUT: Items not noticed by the hideout, for example, i was making moonshine, was wondering why hideout doesnt see my super water inside a RIG. then i vent to scav box and saw i only could take the 7k cash i had on the stash, nothing from money box was noticed by game, i tried moving 500k into an empty slot and it worked, but after i put the 500k back into a moneycause it was ""gone"". So something to do with hideout not seeing inside cases/rigs/etc.

Pictures:

I just wanted to know if there was a change so that items wont get pullet out of your lucky scav junkbox or similar containers anymore.  


I wanted to put new fuel into my generator, wanted to put more GPUs into my bitcoin farm, crafting some bullets, crafting a magazine case... I had to take everything out of my cases manually and put it straight into my stash for it to work.

I don't get the logic here, these people will continue to find exploits, they will once again exploit their skills to elite level probably by the end of this week and the normal players will be punished while they continue to exploit after every skill wipe.

foontg,thekillergreece,What IF the labs were locked behind PMC level / quest besides keycard?,"Currently, it's getting infested and I really doubt Nikita will solve the problem as hackers can chargeback the game and buy again and repeat, leading to endless hacking loops.

&amp;#x200B;

What IF the map was locked behind:

1. Labs Keycard (as always)
2. **PMC Level** (Atleast 35+)
3. After completing a **mid-game quest** (perhaps **Health Privacy Care Part 2** as she asks you to find out about Labs info).

I feel like the hacking problem will be decreased significantly because they would have to pass the three requirements in order to access the map which they will surely not bother to do that and avoid the map alltogether.

Sure, they might go to other maps but it's just an experiment-idea now.

I personally was very hyped for the separation of arm and leg stamina as that would be mean I could be a bit more mobile as a sniper, but what I have found out is now I am running out of stamina for arms way faster than I expected I would. Is it because I am lacking strength I am only at lvl 3 now, and I still find that the stamina for my hands ir running out so fast and I can't snipe for too long.

1. Get a scav loadout from factory and go into customs/labs and try using it, everything you find in raid is fair game
2. Look the part, put together themed kits rather than cookie cutter meta loadouts, 
e.g. slick plate carrier, bank robber rig, duffel bag, Jason/Michael Myers mask, so you can look like an actual bank robber etc
3. Stalk around the map with nothing (akin to Pestily’s zero to hero) bring a paca and dump it at the start of the raid to bypass being tagged and cursed. Instead of rushing loot spots, try melee combat and pvp from scratch

Whats left to play? Factory which is fun but not really an end game experience or Customs and Woods which get boring after running straight for the dozenth time.

=

Also don't say that they are already doing something, if they were then these blatant hackers wouldn't be everywhere now. Used to be that they were only in maybe 1 out of 10 labs games and rarely anywhere else unless it was some new hack. Now I see them nearly every labs game and more than half my shoreline games.

=

How hard is it to gather some data on likely hackers and ban them?? Or to add a report feature so that they don't go free until the next ban wave??? Or to change how the flea market works so you limit the amount of money they can earn?

=

Region lock China for gods sake and make it in such a way that they can't circumvent it by using a vpn.

This kind of shit is such a joke, its what killed the popularity of games like pubg, because eventually a competitor came along and followed the formula and had better anti-cheating policies. Fortnite uses both Easy Anti-cheat and BattleEye, there are frequent ban waves, so did sledgehammer games for COD WWII. Modern multiplayer games like rainbow 6, overwatch, fortnite, cod, etc., all have good anti-cheat, its a core feature for the game.

folx3r,Funy290,"Labs key cards ranked from best to worst, and if you should get them","For context I have over 70 labs runs and am new to the game this wipe so all of this information will be recent. I almost exclusively run labs. when I go solo I run a 10k gun with very cheap ammo, along with a 30 round mag and two 20 round mags that fit in my pockets. I also take in a F1 grenade and a scav BP. This setup added to the price of a keycard equals about 140k as of right now. This is obviously not the only way to run labs solo but is what i'm experienced with so it is what I will base the keycard worth off of.

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 The Green Keycard - I cannot recommend this keycard enough, it is the best keycard for your buck. It has several very close spawns so if it is the only keycard you have it is quite easy to get to first safely. As for loot, almost every time I run it I profit, with the chance of a ledx spawn you can easily pay for the green keycard itself, along with the 2 Secure Documents spawns, and the 2 Defibrillator spawns. At least every other run I come across either a defib or two, or a secure document. If you run a docs case you can store the secure document inside of it using 0 space for the rest of your gamma. If you dont get either spawns, the abundant med sticks,  ophthalmoscopes, and grizzlys should make up for it. In my experience the gun room to the right of the door is nothing to right home about. I have not once gotten the SMG spawn even after a few ledxs and the gun parts are ok. I would recoment this keycard to people who run it every now and then, and those who plan to. If you arnt hard for cash this is also a good starting keycard to pair with the black one. Experienced runners can also get good value out of this card.

\#2 The Black Keycard - This keycard is located right underneath the green keycard and just down the hall from the blue one. It is a great cheap option to hit up after either of those rooms. It wont pay for itself after as little runs as the green, but it is a viable option for some quick medsticks. The glass looking into it is also bulletproof so it works as a good bunker to hide in if you need to retreat from a close gunfight. I would recomend this keycard for anyone who wants to run any amount of labs.

\#3 The Blue Keycard - Being directly under a extract and next to green and blue keycards, it has a great location. Walking into the unlocked part of the room there is a green keycard spawn to help pay off the card. Once you are in the room there are a good amount of medstick spawns along with a ledx spawn. This room grew on me over time as I get ophthalmoscopes from it frequently. The medsticks and ledx also are nice for cash. I would not recommend this keycard for someone who doesn't run labs often.

\#4 The Red Keycard -  At the current price its hard to say if its worth it. But from the experience of someone who got it at 21mil I can say this is a great room. Its next to a lot of spawns and the room before it is relatively safe. There is a green keycard spawn just outside of it, along with its ability to act as a bunker. The red room's door re-locks after it has been closed, making it an extremely safe room to stay in. It is also just above an extract making it easy to run straight to the elevator and extract from the raid. For loot it is super great. I often get semi-built M4s and good parts from the part tables. I have gotten a lot of thermals from the room as well. There is a secure document spawn as well on the desk that spawns frequently. I personally don't bother with the ammo but there are some good spawns (1k+ per bullet). Inside the locked cage has a lot of treasure spawns that can easily net 150k+ every loot, along with Pro Kills and ophthalmoscopes. There are also often medsticks laying on the shelves. It would take a lot of runs to pay off but if you want to stop running it you can always sell back the keycard. I always profit going in there even if I die so I recommend looting it whenever you get the chance. When it was priced at 20-25 mil it would have been easier to place this card higher on the list, but with the recent jump in price up to 38 mil+ I can only recommend it to wealthier players who run labs at least semi-often.

\#5 The Yellow Keycard - While severely lacking in loot its worth bringing into every labs raid. It is extremely cheap and is kind of useful. If you are in a pinch you can use it to trigger the garage opening without sounding the alarms and alerting raiders. I have personally never used the card because of just how situational it is. The only reason it isn't last is because the violet is just garbage. I wouldn't recommend this card to anyone running labs if you are looking for loot, if you like to be prepared for anything then you might as well buy one.

\#6 The Violet Keycard - While this keycard has some okay loot and is in a convenient spot being right next to red, and thus sharing it's position benefits. This card severely lacks the loot it would need to make up for the cost. At almost 10mil it is extremely hard to justify the purchase of one of these cards. I don't have any experience with this room as I only got the card today and haven't had a chance to loot the room. I wouldn't recommend this room unless you are loaded on cash, or are clinically insane.

Hope this guide helped some people with their choices of labs keycards. I would also like to recomend the TerraGroup Labs access keycard as an honorable mention, as I have used it in every single one of my labs runs.

foll5w,xNinjaPigx,Few Problems With The Game,"1. Medical block elevator glitch on Labs. This extract is broken. It isn't like a frequent occurrence. It is every single time and I am not exaggerating. Worst of all, it can get you killed. Luckily I haven't died to it but if I ever do, I might kms
2. Spawning in late/separated. On Labs at least and other maps I've experienced this, I not only spawn in late, but separated from my teammate. The game I just had for example. I spawned 1:30 minutes late into the game. This may not seem like a big deal, but on Labs, spawns are close enough to where it is. There were guys right next to me when I spawned. To make it worse, I wasn't even with my teammate, so I was alone and trying to regroup with my teammate while also managing the guys right next to me. It ruins the raid and happens very frequently.
3. Not an issue I think, just annoying. Raiders on Labs. Insane. Broken. An A.I. should not be able to do things that a human player can't do. Especially nades because those I swear are homing grenades.
4. On the staircases in Labs, there is wind. How is there wind inside. It makes no sense at all and it is so loud.

Overall I love this game. There is a reason I have played it every single day since I got it. I just wish little things like this can be fixed to improve the quality a little bit and get rid of the stupid annoyances. I will add to this if I can remember other things.

I have a weird Frankenstein Pc build in that it's running a 4th gen I7 @ 3.2 GHZ, 12gb of RAM and a GTX 1050TI. Now the RAM is as old as the Pc itself - infact it's cannibalised from other versions of itself, and it's 3 sticks of 4Gb. My Tarkov experience isn't terrible, it runs ok but I want to try to (as cheaply as possible) improve that experience.

foki56,Nexerade,Armor and AP ammo,"Been playing since .3 and have reached ""End Game"" (level 40's/50's) a handful of times in the past. Love watching this game grow in content and story and love where it's going for the most part.

Got a buddy into this game recently so have been playing through this patch late with him. We are around level 28 now. Since we're late, we run into high level guys all the time, which is great. When we kill them it's a great experience and a large payout since we can't purchase their level of gear yet. The problem is it seems like even when we severely outplay them, and a huge number of hits onto them, we are not rewarded and are usually killed anyway, and even bad players seem to easily be able to take out us in few shots afterwards because their armor just absorbs ANY ammo we can buy.

Maybe the ammo has been changed a lot since my last play through a wipe or two ago, but I just can't catch a break. BP used to be at least decent against armor last time I played, but now it appears to be equivalent to using a Makarov. Basically is it BS or bust for 5.45 or what am I missing? Is there another type of ammo available to mid game players that is remotely effective towards end game armor?

I don't mean to kick up old arguments about realism VS fun or anything like that (and inb4 ""just git gud""). The #1 reason I like this game is because it is hardcore, and a lot of time adding realistic elements to it helps it be more hardcore, but if this is realistically how this armor would perform in real life than maybe it should be tweaked a bit or maybe better armor piercing ammo that actually works could be added to traders for mid level players like where we are at (level 25-30). Maybe just 1 type of ammo that can perform but it very expensive or something, that would be enough for me.

Last game, I spotted a geared player who hadn't seen me yet. I was using the absolute best gear available to me - fully kitted 74M with 5.45BP and 60 rounders, and full tier 3 armor. I got into a good position and unloaded on him, multiple hits but he didn't drop. After a good firefight, he ended up killing me. Firefight was fun, but I knew I hit him a ton, and the end game screen confirmed it... but I did a total of only 5 damage to body lol, 98% of the damage I dealt was absorbed by his armor. He didn't even need to bandage or use a medkit I guess. I'm OK with losing fights and being outgeared, but my gut is telling me that if I truly outplay someone I should be able to overcome that and be able to kill them a bit more often than how many times it happens now (and to be clear, it does happen and it's a lot of fun, but I end up dying a lot and feeling like the player who killed me was poorly skilled and only won because their armor absorbed dozens of bullets whereas their ammo penetrated mine in 2 shots, in other words they didn't deserve it and were carried 100% by their gear, not their aim or tactics or etc).

What ammo should I be using at my level? I have finished almost every quest I can (I am at the locked level 30 quests for most traders), and have the traders I can to Loyalty Level 3. The best 5.45 I can buy (as far as I know) is BP, but it is so bad lol. I still use PS for 7.62, as I don't think I have access to anything better. Is there another ammo type with better AP ammo I should be looking at? Or is the best ammo still just buckshot to the legs :P ?

(Last post was deleted because it didn't have flair)

**Edit**: Looks like the Flea Market is the only option for usable ammo. I admittedly forget it is there because it is new to me this playthrough. Was hoping I had missed something with the traders, but glad I have at least one option for good ammo (although I haven't checked prices for it...)!",3,1585112299,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/foki56/armor_and_ap_ammo/,EscapefromTarkov,1
