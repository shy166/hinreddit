fscf9l,duhh321,Bi SO,Me and my wife have been married 12 years. I've known she was bi since we first met. A couple of months ago she told me that there is a girl she goes to college with that she really likes and was wondering if I'd be ok with a threesome. I said hell ya. Well she invited her over one day to hang out they had a lot of fun nothing sexual though just hanging out. Needless to say I did not hit it off with her we just didn't click. My wife still calls and texts her regularly. When they talk on the phone or hang out I can see a look in my wife's eyes like she used to look at me when we first got together. I asked her one day if she's still gonna try and get with this girl she said no and that she is a really good friend and she doesn't want to ruine that. So I left it alone. Yesterday I come home from work and they are talking on the phone for a long time so I go and hang out in the back yard like I do everyday watering plants and what not. Finnaly about an hour later my wife comes to me and asks if it would be ok if she went over to her friends house on Thursday while I watch the kids to paint a  portrait of her friend in a bikini but she said she's going to try to get her topples at least. My wife is an art Major in college. Anyways there is also a nude painting that my wife has done that looks a lot like her friend already wife even agrees it looks like her friend. She Said she painted it off a pic she found on Google but when I asked to see the pic she could not find it any more. Is it just me being paranoid or does this seem fishy. I'm ok with a threesome but if she's screwing another girl without me that just feels like cheating to me.

fsbj29,Lion-1702,Help with a Girl,"I’m am 20 years old and I met this girl at the smoking area in a club. We made good eye contact and we started talking. We then went inside the club and started dancing, and eventually, we kissed. 

That night,  we went back to her place and we started cuddling and kissing and we were having a laugh (we didn’t have sex). 

When I left her place, I gave her a kiss on the cheek. 

The next day, I messaged her and she read it but I got no replies from her. So I sent another messages which had a bit of sarcasm in it, which implied that she was ignoring me.

fsauh6,Salvarite,"Why do some women say that men give their numbers to avoid rejection, when they can simply tell them ""no""?","I just dont get this logic.

Some say that it's to avoid rejection, but you can still tell him ""Sorry, I don't want your number"" or ""Sorry, I don't know you well enough, I won't call"".

But the entire point is to not make them feel pressured to reject him... So they reject him because they think that he should think that women should just deal with the risk of rejecting a violent man?

Like, he's aware that some women think ""please don't be violent"" while rejecting, or maybe they don't think that and their day gets ruined, so to instantly stop the anxiety he makes it easier for the woman but that's appearently cowardish because...... women want to reject as harshly as possible to release some steam against a poor sap? Do they get a high from rejecting men?

I mean, if he hands you his number, and walks away, it kind of makes it impossible for him to hurt anyone.",1,1585651975,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fsauh6/why_do_some_women_say_that_men_give_their_numbers/,AskWomen,1

frrd8z,ttaurusscorpioo,Skyla IUD,"
Hi, I’m not really sure if this is normal but from what i’m reading online this does sound odd. I got my IUD (Skyla) in almost 7 months ago. My cramps have been so so bad and to the point where I have to take Aleeve twice a day and I sleep with my heating pad on my uterus. The worst part is I do not have a low pain tolerance, these cramps are completely debilitating. I literally can’t walk and I have to breathe through some of them like a pregant lady. My day is completely ruined if I get a cramp and don’t have alleve with me. I used to get cramps at random times throughout the day but now i’m getting them in my sleep and they are waking me up. My fingers are to little to check it so my boyfriend checks it for me and it’s always in place. My doctor did check it a month after insertion and she even went as far to say “it looked and felt perfect”. My periods haven’t gotten lighter and they’ve gotten longer. Am I just unlucky?? My greatest fear is that there’s some wrong with my IUD but now is not the time to be going into the doctor for unesscary things. Let me know your thoughts?

Do you want to know what our theme was? We decided to push the boundaries of possibility, to step out of our comfort zones and fight against our weaknesses. 
It was the first time when we tried bungee jumping and skydiving. We had no idea how to keep our memories and how to take a photo of this. How to catch great memories without a photograph with us.

frlz47,busybeebaker47,need help feeling sexy again after a miscarriage,"hey! this is my first time posting (anything anywhere lol) so forgive me if I do it wrong/there's details missing/whatever. also apologize for the length-- as I got writing i realized how much I needed to get off my chest

so in December my (long-term, live-in) boyfriend and I found out that I was about three weeks pregnant after I had severe abdominal pain that led to me losing consciousness and needing to be taken to the hospital. we were both distraught about being pregnant, since we're both only 20 and still in school. he took it in stride and was supportive of any choice that I made about the pregnancy, and was extremely wonderful in the weeks after even with mood swings and nausea and everything else. he was having health issues of his own at this time, and I became his full time caretaker as well as keeping the house clean, making dinners, taking care of our two dogs, etc.

My boyfriend's medical problems began in January, and he needed a lot of time to recuperate due to the stress on his body (very understandably so). while he was in the hospital, I was getting prenatal care at pp (no care before this-- this is an important detail for later) when they started to do a transvaginal and said that I was either not as far along as I thought, or that I had an ectopic pregnancy and would need immediate termination. they took my blood and told me they'd call me with results. they ended up calling me at 8 pm the next day, and said that my hcg levels were very high and that I needed to go to the ER to make sure I didn't have an ectopic pregnancy. my boyfriend had just been discharged from that very hospital, but he wanted to come with me to offer support so he came along too. at the hospital they took more blood, took a urine sample, and did another transvaginal. before leaving the hospital that night, we found out that the pregnancy hadn't developed. well, as I'm sure you read from the title, I ended up having a miscarriage at 10.5 weeks, about a week and a half after the pp visit. 

the miscarriage came on suddenly in the middle of the night, my stomach/abdomen had been bothering me all day. I was using the bathroom when I felt a sudden gush of blood and tissue come out, and I started to lose consciousness again. I was able to get up and into our bedroom and wake my boyfriend up, and he drove me to the hospital again. while there the doctors and nurses confirmed I was having a miscarriage, and they helped clear out any tissue left over. they gave me medicine for the pain and we drove to my pharmacy to pick up the prescription, diapers, pads, and some snacks for the next few days. I ended up wearing adult diapers and sleeping on a hospital pad for a week (after that i was able to use regular pads and tampons). 

Now, this is the part that I need help with. having to wear diapers for a week and sleep on a hospital pad made me feel absolutely disgusting, and I didn't have enough energy to shower regularly either. no one knew that I was pregnant, so I couldn't talk to anyone about the miscarriage besides my boyfriend. he's absolutely lovely and supportive and everything I've ever asked for or needed or dreamed of in a partner, but he just doesn't understand in the way I think yall will. I felt like my body failed me-- like it's designed for one thing and it couldn't even do that. even though I hadn't wanted to be pregnant, there was a difference in not wanting a pregnancy at that stage in our lives and not being able to carry one, at least to me. I lost 15 pounds in the two months since the miscarriage, and I feel like my body is oddly shaped now that I've lost some weight, especially in my chest. we tried to have sex after I stopped bleeding, but it hurt so bad we had to stop. we've only been able to successfully have sex a handful of times in eight weeks, and I feel terrible about it. sex was a big part of our relationship before and it helped me to feel desirable and sexy and beautiful, as well as just feel closer to him in general. I'd like to return to that, but even him kissing me in more intimate places (neck, shoulders, breasts) makes me focus on all the parts of my body I don't like. I've helped him find completion a few times, but I know he'd like more intimacy as well. (to be clear, he has never asked for anything sexual more than once, and respects my boundaries. he tries to help me feel sexy by giving me lots of compliments and making me smile, but I think this has to come from me) 

does anyone have tips to help me feel more comfortable in my new body? I've been working out a little bit but thats not helped very much.

I'd appreciate any help (and anyone who got through this long post was a real trooper, thank you!!)

frkwr8,Plastic-Education,Guilt in a relationship over a EX.,"So I don't know if I should be feeling this way. But I have been with my SO for about 5 months. We are a great match and I love everything about him. Recently, my ex, committed to a major D1 school for a sport and received a major title that only a select few receive in the country. We had a good relationship but we both knew we were never going to work out, our life goals were to different and so we just decided to enjoy each others company before I left for college (this past year). My SO does not like when he is brought up or when his friends talk about him (which I understand given the circumstances). When I noticed that my ex received this award, I knew how much it meant to him and how much work he put into it. We haven't spoken at all since I got with my SO but I still care about him and want him to succeed. I feel guilty and like I am letting my SO down for caring about him still and texting him to congratulate him. I never told him I texted considering we only exchanged two texts (congrats &amp; thank you). I feel like I am overreacting and letting my emotions get to me especially because of this whole social isolation by myself but maybe there's a valid reason for my guilt? Has anyone else had personal experience with emotions like this?

frkqto,CptnSlow19,My Girlfriend hurt me and I dont know what to do,"So a couple months ago, in october. My girlfriend left for college. Our 1 year anniversary is on october 31st 2018, so we were a month away from celebrating our one year. Anyways, We were having a little trouble with the distance. My Ex's have cheated on me and let other guys in. So I tend to worry a lot about other guys. But my trust issues I guess got the best of me and she said on the 9th of October, that we couldnt be together anymore. I was HEARTBROKEN. but two days after she had a thing with another guy. And f***ed him. And keep in mind she never told me about it, I had to find out from her college friend. And later on in the month, THREE DAYS BEFORE I WENT DOWN TO VISIT FOR OUR ONE YEAR, she had s*x with another guy. I didnt find out until I was there on november 2nd, that she had intercourse with the second guy. I had no idea about the first guy yet. But anyways, the whole month of october she would call me some nights and say she loved me. Which I believed. But now that it's all said and over with, we are together. She seems to be alright now, and doesnt talk to other guys. Or at least tells me about them. I'm not one to be controlling so I do my very best to mind my own business, but sometimes I cant help it but to ask. ANYWAYS. She says it was such a hurtful month that some parts are blank and she regrets it all, and I get that. But I cant seem to get over the fact she slept with two guys after she left me and says she still loves me. I dont understand and I think itll tear my relationship apart if I dont figure it out.

frkjz6,Level_3_Gay,What do females do with all their free time.,"Why does something like 90% of women have no hobby they actively pursue at all. 

I know im generalizing 50% of the world's population about now but it seems like 90% of my real-life friends and classmates that I don't meet online always talk about a subject somewhat linked to relationships. Never about hobbies. While there are females with a tangible activity they spend time on, they're the minority, 10%. You wouldn't believe the number of people I talk to that just say shit like ""Hobby? Yeah, my hobby is hanging out with my friends"" or ""idk I did baking 10 months ago that counts I guess"". 

Most of my male friends have some genuine hobbies like electronics, coding, video games, hiking, cooking, basketball/sports. But when it comes to females, I can't name many people I know that even have a hobby. It could be my school and my sample size of friends I guess and just how 90% of everyone that's female just happens to consider something generic that everyone does like socializing their only hobby. 

You could argue that's it could be travel, but let's keep it real here. Most of us can't afford to travel or any form of vacation/holiday.",1,1585544083,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/frkjz6/what_do_females_do_with_all_their_free_time/,AskWomen,1

A few weeks after meeting/going on dates with him, he told her he didn’t want to see her anymore because he met someone else. Of course she found me on instagram and told me how I ruined her life and stole her man. I was nice to her, even apologized. She still to this day, checks my instagram, views my stories, and even comments on our pictures “I can’t wait until he cheats on you”. I’ve never responded to her. I just ignored it. Her number is blocked on my boyfriends phone. Part of me doesn’t block her because I’m curious to see how long she’ll keep this up for (I should be more adult about it, I know but it’s entertaining lol)

frj5kg,SkaySaky,How do you accept being a woman,"This is a strange and vague question I know right.

I’m a woman too, by genetics at least, but I’m kinda lost. I went searching answers in various subreddits, but also forums and..TED talks (..yes).
I just landed here and I hope this is not too irrelevant-

I’m almost 18, facing an identity crisis for a couple years. 
I’m just not feeling comfortable being me. I mean in the inside I’m pretty fine, I like the way I am.. But once I think about people seeing me irl, I get a really strange sensation. It’s like I don’t have a physical form? Or I rather don’t have a physical personality..

I don’t know.. My thoughts are so messy. I keep thinking I’m a dude and I wish I could just find a way to be happy being a woman. Find a style maybe or something that can help me because I really. Really really don’t pay enough attention to my appearance oof

It’s not like I faced misogyny, or experienced traumatic circumstances, but I don’t know how I should present myself. I have some ideas of the type of woman I’d like to look like but I’m feeling invalidated somehow? Like it will never be me whatever I try?


Anyway I ask this here because I’m so scared my sensation to be a man is just because I don’t feel comfortable with myself, being a woman, if you see what I mean.
I read a lot on detrans places and yeah, I see a lot of people who finally find themselves after making the mistake of transitioning.
but waiting 10 years for it, I mean, that’s long, so..

frilhb,Throwaway302s,Should I be concerned? (Seeking understanding),"I (32M) have been married to my wife (30F) for 8 years. We have kids. Since having kids, she has lost weight and has become much healthier. I have always been fit and athletic so I am happy with her taking care of herself. She wears flattering clothes and has great confidence. 

When we were newly married, she always did things that I liked. She knew that I liked thongs so she always wore one. Also, she gave blowjobs to me almost everyday in addition to the wonderful sex. She was quite adventurous, sexually. There were no limits. She flung herself onto me even after having our kids. 

Things have changed since she has become healthier, which has been roughly a year. Her diet is cleaner, and it has paid off. She no longer tries to impress me by wearing thongs or performing oral sex on me. We still have occasional sex, but she doesn’t seem interested. She does it because she feels she needs to. It’s not fun to either of us. Plus, she will not let me finish inside her anymore because she doesn’t take BC anymore. 

I am concerned that she is changing and our marriage is going to fail. I fell in love with someone much different than the person I am married to today. I understand people change, but I am concerned something else is going on.

When I insert, let's say, a dildo, into my vagina, there's this point about 1 inch in at which I have to push a lot harder because it seems to be lined with a ring of very tight muscle. It helps if I intentionally relax my muscles down there but geez when I tense them it's impossible to put anything in at all. It ranges from being annoying, to uncomfortable, to downright painful.
And it's just that one spot. Once anything is past there...well...it's almost as though there isn't any muscle past it. The rest of my vagina, deeper inside, seems to be very flexible and mushy.
But even when I relax my muscles as much as possible, it seems it (e.g. the dildo) doesn't go in smoothly, it...""pops"" in. Does that make sense?

Is this just a normal vagina? XD
From what I know it's not supposed to ""pop"" in...

fr6e4u,mavericksroot,How important are the looks for women when it comes to casual sex?,"How Important are the looks for women when it comes to casual sex?

Hi, I’m 23M. Before stating anything, I want to say that I haven’t had sex yet and that I’m very inexperienced with women. I’m currently working full time and besides that I’m doing my masters, that means I’m busy most of the time.

For three years or so, I have seborrhoeic dermatitis, a long-term skin disorder, the symptoms are typically red, greasy, itchy skin which transforms into scaly skin when it is not acute anymore. This disorder is quite visible at my nose, my eyebrows, my scalp and my ears. Otherwise, I would describe myself as normal, I’m 6’1” (186cm) and thin.

As I have stated before, due to my situation I don’t have the time or the goal to be in a relationship. Nonetheless, I have human needs, especially of sexual nature. Therefore, I would like to have occasional one night stands and/or a fuck buddy. 

As the sexual aspect of the relationship are at the forefront, most women (and men) will first consider the attractiveness of the person they’re sleeping with. I’m concerned that I won’t be able to find such relationships due to the fact that I have an unattractive face. In the past i have used tinder and literally swiped all the profiles to the right, and at the end of the month I had two matches, one fake and one of a transsexual (obviously fake) profile. 

So my question is: How important are looks in a casual relationship? Do I stand any chances?",1,1585490858,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fr6e4u/how_important_are_the_looks_for_women_when_it/,AskWomen,1

I'm convinced that she's just stuck to an inefficient style that she learned while growing up and has never honestly considered that she doesn't actually need that much.

I don't have a vagina so I can't rightly tell her what to do with hers; I just have to take her word for it. I just wanted an honest representation and opinion of other women on this matter!

fr20c4,pjallefar,Let her go or let her make up her own mind?,"I (28M) have been with my girlfriend (28F) for just over 3 years. 


We met at a new years eve at her place. I lived abroad at the time but was back in the city where I grew up to have new years with my oldest friends. 
This is the night I met her as we ended up going to a party at her place. 

We start seeing each other a lot, quickly after this new years eve. 

Having lived in the capital for a few years and then abroad, I was not a big fan of moving back to the city where I grew up. It's just not really the person I am anymore. 

We talk about this very openly. She does not want to move to the capital and I tell her I will have a hard time living here. 

She lives and has always lived in this city and plans on living all of her life there, due to job, friends and family. 

Because we are happy about each other, I stay. 

Fast forward a few years, having had the best relationship ever - both of us felt this - I just can't stay in that town anymore. 

I move back to the capital, without her - though she knows she is welcome to join me, I just can't stay in that town anymore. She doesn't want to and I understand - she probably wouldn't be happy here. 

We are still together, see each other on weekends and sometimes during the week. 

However, she is very very ready for kids and a family. And she felt that that was very close, before I moved out. So while she understands, I think that she also hates me a bit underneath it all. I get that. I am the symbol of taking away all the things she thought she had (babies and a ""grown-up"" life). I need to mention that I was always very honest about probably not being able to stay in this town forever. 

Anyways, it is really tearing her down now. She feels mentally bad and can't figure out what to do. We talk very openly about it all. On one hand, our relationship has been so good, that she isn't sure she can find something similar - on the other hand, she wants kids etc and does it make sense for her to wait two years for me to maybe be ready to move back? 

Do I let her make up her own mind? Do I let her go? I love her very much, but it breaks my heart to see her fall apart because I cannot really give her everything she wants. I feel like she deserves a man who is more stable than me and can just live in that city and give her a good life and a few kids. I just can't do that now. Maybe in a few years, maybe in 5.

I have been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian disorder so I know why I get them, and I’m sorta used to them being lengthy, I had an iud in for 3 years that completely stopped my cycle all together, but the extra hormones in it make me feel like a different person so I took it out in hopes my body would regulate itself, but so far I’ve had it out for 2 months, and I have had 2 periods a month both 5 days. Today was supposed to be the last day of my most recent one and it’s usually very light the last day, but I can tell that it’s not going anywhere. 
Does anyone else get this? The doctors I’ve seen are all sorta unhelpful and shocked when it comes to how long it lasts.

However, when I see another woman it really makes me mad. I'm not sure if it's about me as I have no problem expressing myself, it's just when I see a woman who is clearly wrong when talking about a certain issue and has a need for everyone to hear her and is also dismissive of other people's opinions. I have an older woman inside my family who is always commenting on others' lives, she is giving them her stance which nobody asked for and it gets pretty offensive especially since her perspective is objectively outdated. Similarly, I have a semi friend who has always had a problem with arrogance and her recent job became a pat on the back for her behavior. For instance, she is making fun of people for being isolated in this chaos. She is still going outside, living her life and putting others in danger. I confronted her and she got aggressive as if I'm insulting her intelligence.

I took a Plan B on March 7th and experienced “withdrawal bleeding” 6 days after. My ovulation date was March 10th (according to the Flo App) and I was expected to get my period on March 26th but havent gotten it still. Rn should I continue to wait for my period or take a pregnancy test??? I’m like really stressing herre and I know i shouldn’t since it just makes matters worse.

fqkciu,ImEducatingMyself,Which one of these guys you would choose and why?,"1. He's masculine, average height, attractive, reliable, good listener know to take care of himself from to cooking to cleaning. He's hard working, have a job but it's not ambitious to earn a lot of money; he is frugal, knows hot to handle money that he earns. He have hobbies and is happy and satisfied with his life. You go out on dates several times a week, he don't like to be smothered and to smother you.

2. He's tall and quite attractive. Very ambitious, he's most important goal in life is his career; sacrificing and working very hard for at least next 15 years to achieve his goals. He often cancels out on dates, late on dates, you rarely hang out together. When you are together most of the time he spends talking about his career, he's not a good listener. He would buy you often expensive gifts. He often asks you to do something for him around the house, or to go out and do some shopping for him. He promises that all of that will change one day when he have enough money for both of you to retire and enjoy somewhere where ever you choose.

3. He's quite attractive, average height or tall you choose it. He knows how to take care of himself for the most part in his life. Like the first guy he's not too ambitious in his life, not very good with money either because he likes to buy nice and expensive things. He don't have any hobbies, most of the times he focus on you and only your. He want's to be with you all the time, talking to you over the phone every day, messaging you constantly. When you are together all he do is talks, not very good listener. He's too emotional and gentle, expresses his emotions often, talks a lot about his feelings. Romance is everything for him, he would buy you flowers often. He almost always asks you what you want to do, where you want to go.",1,1585402764,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fqkciu/which_one_of_these_guys_you_would_choose_and_why/,AskWomen,1

We got into a huge argument. I didn’t help either by yelling and calling him something rude. 

I locked myself in the bathroom and he slapped me twice, hit my arm twice, kicked my butt where I fell down and hit my back twice while trying to push me down the stairs. 

I know he didn’t mean it bc he was upset. I haven’t told my parents or his bc he is a good guy and I love him so much. He has done so much for me and I do wanna spend my life with him. 

We’re moving in together next month and i just feel kind of scared. I love him to death but after today I just feel weird. A part of me thinks I deserve it bc I yelled at him and called him something mean. But I don’t hit him when I’m upset. 

He apologized and even started crying bc he didn’t want it to get to that. He told me if i left him he would understand bc he messed up. 

I don’t want to leave him but everytime i look in the mirror and see the bruisers I just feel so sad and worthless. I know he loves me and would do anything for me and i love him too. 

Why do i feel so sad and just weird? Will this feeling end? Will he do it again? I just want to know i’ll be ok bc rn I am hiding how much hurt i have bc there’s other issues rn with us moving out of parents house and just family drama. He does have it really hard rn. I feel like the moving out and family drama issue is a lot more important than mine.

fqdgcf,CaliFilAm,Should I even try anymore if she blocked me?,"Hey ladies of reddit, 

I’ve been having a problem trying to figure out if this girl I caught feelings for is worth reaching out to anymore..
I don’t feel like telling the whole story, but she ended up blocking me.  We knew each other for years - we live both across country from each other. 

I insecurely opened up my feelings for her twice, because the second time I got jealous when I visited her in her state - she was staying at another dudes place when I went to visit her, because her work was close to his place. He was older than us. We were early 20’s, he was early 30’s. I felt like a fool at the end of the trip, I cancelled plans she made for us telling her we should give each other space. Regretfully I don't know wtf I was thinking to tell her that from being drunk. I told her sorry last day of the trip asked her if there was anyway we can meet up but she shut everything down and worked an open shift. I foreal felt like a piece of 💩, for having her cancel plans she made in advance weeks before I came on my last day there.
When I got back home I didn’t text her in 3 weeks when I finally did I noticed she blocked me. Greeted her happy holidays during that time on her other phone, but she blocked me on that number after too. In the middle of that time I tried reaching to her on fb messenger, but she only read the message. I felt like I was now just wasting my time so I deleted my FB fully, not because of that but because I really just wanted to not have social media anymore. That was pretty much my open contact with her anymore.

Now, 2-3 months later after deleting that. I still think of her been able to get my mind off her but I really miss having our nightly convos, her birthday passed a couple days ago but I didn’t greet her. I was on the urge to by voicemail since voicemails aren’t blocked but I didn’t. I felt like she would’ve just ignored me still at the end. Should I just not reach out to her anymore at all? 

I left a lot of details out, but from what I explained any advice would be helpful to get a peace of mind. Thanks..",1,1585370335,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fqdgcf/should_i_even_try_anymore_if_she_blocked_me/,AskWomen,1

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

fpuozp,Medium-Grape,Could being hairy be a dealbreaker?,"Hello everyone.

Man here. I hope I'm not breaking any rules.

Here it goes. I am very hairy, all over the place. Myself, I don't mind it. I actually like it, it's one of the few things that make me feel manly. I don't like the fact that I have it on my back and shoulders, which brings me to my second point.

I can't afford laser treatment, which would probably be ideal in getting rid of back hairs; waxing is way too painful and the times I did it, because I have a rather vivacious regrowth, my back would start feeling like itchy sandpaper in the space of not even a week; I live alone, so shaving is rather impractical and, again, because of my regrowth, I'd probably have to do it every day.

So, in light of all of this, would my hairiness be a reason of rejection? I don't know if I'm allowed, but I'm going to give some visual proof. Please don't think I'm trying to show off. God only knows I have nothing to show off in the first place. If this goes against the rules, I'll remove it immediately.  [Here it is (NSFW).](https://i.imgur.com/JfbR5mr.jpg)

My parents divorced few years ago with almost no communication between themselves anymore.
About a year ago, my mom has started a new relationship which had helped her moving on in her life. However when my dad learnt about my mom's new partner, his reaction was very negative disapproving him mainly because of his skin color.

Two months ago, my sister also started a new relationship with an African boyfriend. Sadly my dad has stopped to communicate with my sister as well.

As per myself, I am still talking to him but my position is obviously not so simple. I am feeling pressured being in the middle of everyone.
Do you think there are still chances that my dad would reconnect with my sister?

fpt2gd,bowbow007,How do I get over my depression due to horrible period cramps ?,"23, female here. 
If you've ever been through this situation, please tell me about your experiences. 

My period cramps are progressively getting worse as I grow older. My first cramps that significantly affected my daily activities started when I was around 16. In those days, I would ride it out by tossing and turning over in my bed until it went away. 

Around 18, I had my first hospital experience after the cramps got so bad that I was vomiting and passing stool back to back on the first day. 

Since then I've been taking aceclofenac tablets at the onset of period pain. Some women advised that taking these pills will affect my reproductive life later on, so I stopped these pills and tried some alternative meds like ayurveda for a while. I went back to my regular pills after not getting the promised results.

In the beginning, 1 pill was enough for the entire mentruating period, as I only cramped during the onset. But now I get recurring cramps during the first 3 days and I'm having to take 3-4 pills  to  keep myself away from the hospital. 

I'm worried that this situation is going to get worse, perhaps these pills will stop working? Or the pill number is going to keep increasing?

When women hear about my pill dependency for periods, they tell me how they're bad for my health, I feel so bad for taking them. But I don't have another choice. No special diet or juice or eastern medicine will stop these cramps. 

I don't know if my dysmenorrhea is a signal of something else like endometriosis. I've heard that an accurate diagnosis can be made through surgical intervention only and atm, I don't have any support to undergo such a procedure. My mom tells me this is just my uterus preparing for childbirth and the cramps will disappear after the first child. But I have no idea when that's gonna happen. 

I just popped my fourth pill, and I am feeling so much hate For myself. I wish I could be like other normal women. I don't know what's lying ahead of me. I know women in some countries are prescribed contraceptives for this. But in my country it is not a norm. Any medicine that messes with the hormonal cycle is frowned upon. 

If you have ever been through this situation, please tell me how you have dealt with it? Both mentally as well as medically. 

Thanks.

I thought this meant she was going for a hug but it ended up being a pretty awkward one armed hug. I think she was pissed because she didn't even look at me after and just ran into her car. I said goodnight but she just goodnight back in a fairly angry way without even looking at me. I texted her the next day about the next weekend, but she said she didnt see things going anywhere. 
Do you think she wanted a kiss, or was she going for a hug like I thought? Ive never seen a girl with one arm out like that at the end of a date. I was thinking about it and anytime a woman has gone for a hug at the end of a date they do it before you even have a chance to kiss them. Even if it was a kiss she was going for do you think not kissing her would mean she would make her not want to see me again, or do you think she wasn't interested anyway?

Idk how I would get a job and make enough money to live comfortably without a degree, but at the same time a degree doesn't determine anything and the thought that I might still have no job with a degree is so frustrating. Have any of you ever felt like what you were doing was pointless? Do you have an advice on school and work? Everyday I dream about dropping out.

One day he asked me out over text, I said yes, although slightly hesitantly. This is the first romantic relationship I have even been in, as embarrassing as that is, so I can't tell if I love him or just love his attention (he's a good boyfriend). I've been very badly emotionally and mentally hurt in the past, so I tend to not let myself feel deep emotions for others.
Also, if any experienced women had any advice for this beginner as to how to be a good girlfriend, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1,1585288104,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fprmgo/how_can_you_tell_the_difference_between_loving/,AskWomen,1

He buys us slippers and steals it from hotels, our house is full of every type of slipper u can think of. Low key, if I’m sick or I don’t feel well is always because I supposedly went barefoot. Headache? Slippers matters. Fever? Have u been wearing slippers when I was out? The neighbor died of heart attack? Those non slippers users, damn, irresponsibility kills. Now he insists we have to be more careful because of corona, it means we absolutely must wear slippers because the virus could CRAWL on the floor and be absorbed by our soles. Our family gifted him a enormous slipper full of slippers last year and he was so happy “this issue was finally properly taken care of” even if he said we shouldn’t joke on such a important habit. When we went back home he lectured us about the importance of slippers and to take it seriously for the 357853th time. Sometimes, he is in the backyard and hears the sound of me going barefoot in my room if my window is open and screams to put on slippers like the house is on fire.

So please tell me what you would do? 

So, I met a homeless middle-aged man the other day, and gave him my phone number in case he needed anything. He called me today to ask if he could use my shower, and I of course let him. So he was at my place for a while, and I got him a meeting tomorrow to see a room for rent. And because I can never disappoint anyone, he's coming around for coffee tomorrow morning before the meeting.

He's not staying at my place tonight - though I do feel bad about that - because I couldn't justify to myself the safety of that considering he's basically a stranger. 

So he's perfectly nice and kind, but he is also a middle aged man who has struggled with drugs and I'm a 23 year old disabled woman living alone, who's nearest family and friends are a two hour drive away.

Me, my date and my friends were in my front yard taking pictures and it was all exciting. My dad came home from work ignoring everyone and went straight inside the house, I forgot where my mom is around the time he came home but she was very happy for my prom day and took a lot of pictures. I didn't really mind it at the time because it was PROM and I was excited but a couple days later I started to wonder, why didn't he even say hi to me? I told my mom how I felt and she said well your dad does other things for you (something like that). I know he does other things for me and Im grateful for that but why didn't he say hi to me, hug me, tell me to have fun or take a picture with me. I guess I have to mention that my dad isn't a very talkative person but its a big part of my high school career to be a senior and to go to prom.

I never had an issue with texting in my previous relationships because my exes and I had similar texting styles. I don’t expect him to respond to me right away, but I don’t appreciate being left on read all the time when I just send a simple question or text. I have spoken to him about this a couple of times, the most recent this past weekend. He said he would try better, but he hasn’t.

At my house the mirrors make me look way better than I do in real life. I don't know if it's the lights or the mirrors but even up close to the mirror it's still hard to tell how I look in real life. I got overconfident in my looks because of this reason and was shocked when one time my friend told my that I should probably blot my face because my makeup looks cakey (I asked for her honest opinion). But when I looked in the mirror i looked amazing so i had no idea even how to fix my makeup. Then recently i went to college and the mirrors and lights in my dorm are AMAZING. They show exactly how I look in real life up close and from a distance and that friend even said my makeup got a lot better. But many places I go they have the same thing as my house where the mirrors dont make me look how I look in real life and the mirrors and lighting have a photoshop effect where it's hard to tell how i look in real life.

I'm 6 months pregnant and have Sjourgens, with the Covid-19 outbreak, I am essentially quarantined until my due date in July. My Mother has been a Trump supporter from the get-go, parroting every Fox News phrase and conspiracy theory they have touted. Yet, I think this is my last straw with maintaining any type of relationship with her; she has not only sent me various pieces on how this virus was produced in a Chinese lab to hurt Americans, but she is in favor of the Trump's push to reopen the country by Easter...which will prevent the flattening of the curve, and cause at least one more wave of this shit. 

I sent her articles on how NY hospitals are now refusing to allow anyone to support women during labor because of the lack of PPE, and she came back by saying, ""That's not going to happen and is a hoax."" This is my first child and the idea of not having my husband with me is unbearable to think about, and I have even started to worry about the hospitals being completely overrun by that time, forcing home births...etc. I did not plan on attempting that, in my wildest dreams, for my first. The rage and hatred I have for this cult that has overtaken the WH is relentless, and we haven't even reached the worst of it here in the US.

fomqc7,theescapist1,My gf's first porn! Women I need your help! nsfw,"Hi everybody!

Lately I've had (M21) a few talks with my gf (21) about trying something new. She's really naive when it comes to sex and doesn't really know what she likes even though we've been together for 7 months and she has had a bf for a year and a half before that. In my opinion that's also a result of her education where sex is kind of a taboo. In the last few months I've tried (with some success) to expose her to new stuff (I'm talking super vanilla stuff, even oral sex was weird for her and now she loves it!). Last night we had a talk and I asked her if she would have liked to watch her first porn video with me. She agreed and I guaranteed her that I would have chosen a video beforehand that has to check the following boxes:

\-have just 2 people in it, pref male and female

\-both the male and female have to be treated respectfully (basically porn for women/amateur)

\-vanilla stuff, I don’t want to scare her!

\-I also know that she would prefer it if the actors where good looking cause I know she really appreciates beauty in people even in real life

I’ve found this video that seems to be appropriate to these “requirements”: [https://www.bellesa.co/videos/1213/mindblowingly-hot-homemade-sex](https://www.bellesa.co/videos/1213/mindblowingly-hot-homemade-sex)

Now… I’m a man and I’ve seen al kinds of porn in my life so it’s hard for me to know what it is like to be a woman who has never watched a porn video and I’d like to ask the feedback of some women who can probably empathize with her much better on this topic.

If you have tips in general or specific videos you’d like to suggest I’d love to hear your opinions!

fo4c4i,Johanna-Anuar,"Mothers of autistic children, do you think letting children eat only the foods they like or tolerate (e.i nuggets) is actually enabling the child a bad relationship with food?","So, writing as a woman with ASD and has a bf with suspected ASD, we really think our kids are bound to be on the spectrum. 

On Twitter lately, I see a lot of mothers saying that due to the panic buying - their autistic children with a very limited diet are going to be affected. It's mostly a lot of children who eat one or two things, and they're mostly store-bought products or fast food products like nuggets, yogurts, cereals. And I don't see that as a good thing, imo. 

This got me thinking... I have a very broad food palette and can be picky with what I eat. But as a child, I was forced to eat what was on the table. My mother is a cook and she does it for a living. I do have sensory issues with light, touch, artificial flavours like bubblegum and mint. 

So my additional questions are: 

\-Do you think children with sensory issues can be helped with more exposure to different foods (preferably healthy foods) or is it a lost cause? 

\-If your children tolerate eating foods that are unhealthy, how much of it do you think is sensory and not 'behaviour' (like ""if I refuse long enough, parents will give me what I want""). 

Just asking out of respect and curiosity, and I do not demonise anyone who has children with ASD who have these issues.",1,1585053100,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fo4c4i/mothers_of_autistic_children_do_you_think_letting/,AskWomen,1

fo3k2k,banddroid,Advice: What's This Thing On My GF's Labia Minora?,"Hello Lady Redditors,

Last night I noticed something odd on my gf's labia minora. Right at the bottom, just above her perineum. Her and I looked through common diseases and such but nothing stands out as a possible candidate for what it is.

Basically, it's a greyish-white layer of skin in the area described, with a dark black spot. It sort of looks like when you have a scab and then go swimming and it gets water-logged. She says she has no itching or discharge. I tried scraping it a little and nothing came off.

We both got a full STD screen before getting together, and both completely negative. We moved in together about a month ago, and this appeared about a week ago, so I wonder if it's just irritation from the use of different detergents or something. To me it looks fungal though.

I suggested we go to a doctor, but she is reluctant. Any ideas would be very helpful. Also, I could perhaps convince her to let me post a picture of it, but preferably would like to avoid that.

&amp;#x200B;

fo1q0r,sleep_boi,"I'm a man and my girlfriend has had a rough past with domestic violence. I want to get it across that I will not be the same. I'm unsure of how does an abused woman rebuild trust in men, hence I ask for your views","Hello, I'm a 22 year-old guy. I've been with my girlfriend for the past 6 months. I've known her since long before, we were best friends for 2 or so years before we started dating. She had had a troubled past, with an violent, cheating, absent father who she finally got freed of when her parents separated 2 years ago. Her ex, I found out once I got together with her, was also physically abusive towards her. 

She's a traumatised soul, I love her from the bottom of my heart and wish to be with her forever. We have both said to each other that we're *it* for each other, we've found our forever partners in each other. 

We're Indians, a country where parents tend to marry off their kids to a stranger in an arranged marriage. We don't want that, and know that life would be hell without each other.

We're extremely close and share all our fears and anxieties with each other. Both of us have an underlying fear of abandonment. That the other may go out of their lives. Both of us initially didn't believe it when either of us called the other beautiful/handsome. (It has gotten better, we love to soak in the compliments now 😬)

She has confided in me that she has a distrust towards men, which I totally understand. 

Sometimes she is fearful of me too, thinking that I'm being nice right now and will change later. I quote a text i got today: *""You might be nice right now. What's to stop you from hitting me or abusing me the moment this relationship turns legal and I have no way out of it?""*

I know from the bottom of my heart that I want to protect this girl, our relationship and create a safe space for her to come back to. I want to build a place we can come back to in peace, to rest, recharge and grow in our lives, so we can live happy, so we can feel safe and comforted I'm each other's company. 

I have said these things to her. I have never ever had the thought of lifting even a finger against her. I have never ever made any indication that I'll be violent against her, because I *know* I don't want to. I want to settle all our issues via argument and debate and that's it. Smacking each other's ass for fun is the extent of hitting I want us to get involved in.

Domestic violence is something I have never seen in my own life. My own parents have taught me to respect your partner and discuss things out as the only means for conflict resolution, and I have seen them practice this religiously for 20+ years. I want to protect her from this world of abuse and neglect by caring for her, I don't want to ever hurt her.

However, I'm unsure how do I get it across to her, apart from my behavior and telling her my life story, about my upbringing. How do I start making inroads to her heart? I want to protect it, that's all. I only want to be happy with her. What made you guys trust your partner? I'm confused and come here seeking your views om this.

BUT why don’t men understand that when a woman finds a man that she truly finds herself happy with, she doesn’t look for that fulfillment other places? She doesn’t need the attention from social media or the tinder messages showing interest. I would much rather have the 1 guy that makes me really happy all of the time over 20 men that make me feel better about myself temporarily. Why is it that most men don’t believe in marriage? That you can have a long overall happy marriage? It’s a partnership, a team effort. Not all partnerships are just a look at a bed of roses, it’s the thorns included. You have to get through the rough patches to get the true beauty out of life and that includes ugly bouts. 

Sorry this is all over the place but I saw a thread on 4Chan where men were just trashing women and the ideas of marriage. It’s literally all just “a woman won’t be happy with just you” or “eventually you won’t be anything compared to the kids” FUCKING DUH THEY LITERALLY ARE YOUR LIFE NOW. Or “the romance fades and it becomes a just a business partnership” yeah when you stop putting in the effort it does. It’s not always beautiful and lustful. There’s hard times.

fnl7o0,Agent_Zeroo,Getting mixed feelings from this (F28) Girl. Need some opinions on this,"Hey All

I'll try to make it short and get to the point.

I met this amazing girl 1 month ago and we went on a date and everything was fine and amazing and we both had a good time, but her attitude changed so many times the last week and it's confusing me.

Here's what's confusing me:

\- 4 Days ago she texted me that her dad was under quarantine (due to COVID 19) and she is so stressed because of all the problems happening and i tried to calm her down and not be stressed and later she said her mother came to stay with her. So after that talk about 1 hour later i was asking some questions of when will u go see your father and will your mother be going to your father soon or stay there until the quarantine is over. She completely blow on me with cold approach saying : **( why are you so interested in knowing this... you are acting as if we are in a relationship ).**

She was really irritated of me being interested in this way and it got me kinda sad that i maybe did a mistake of asking. I explained to her that it isn't like you think and that i only like her and not thinking about something more that for the time being. But she kept saying **( Are you like this against other people ... asking and being interested like this ).**

I explained to her that she told me about the situation with her father and mother and i only asked because of that.

Anyway she said that she saw her mistake and should've not blown at me this way.

No problem i understood her and said I'm sorry for my behaviour.

\- 2 Days ago i texted her and she was answering me fast and i see her being excited talking to me and telling me how her day was. But she got irritated again after i said something along the lines of **( maybe someone else could explain it better than me ).**

Again all of a sudden she said **( why are you talking to me like we are dating or have something between us ).** Which i didn't said or had anything in my mind in that Topic (AGAIN). I got really irritated and told her sorry because it's a weird place to be in this situation and just left the talk and that was that.

So all in all i'm really confused of what's happening in her mind... Am i just uninterested for her or she put me on her friendzone that she doesn't want to think anything else than friends. She acts interested and txting me/ called me also, but also getting easily annoyed at something i said.

Any tips : Is it my fault and should i just leave and dont bother her?

A bit long, but hope it makes sense :D

I hide from the mirror so I don't have to see myself. I especially can't cope with my bum and my belly, I wear clothes to hide them so I don't have to worry so much about it. I have a flattish bum and I am having so much anxiety over it that it is affecting my relationship. I exercise regularly in order to try and get the body I will be happy with, I've even bought whey protein powder to help. I would love some golden nuggets of wisdom about how to  1) build a bum, 2) get rid of nuisance back fat and 3) tone the belly.

Sorry for the rant but I just needed to reach out, especially in these trying times I don't want to be fixating on these issues so I would appreciate any advice.

When I first started, I was the only male. 

There was a lot of sexism thrown around about me. Most the ladies I was working with were saying things like. 

“You’re a guy, you won’t be able to do this work.”

Or... 

“Men aren’t creative.”

Or

“Men are colorblind.”

Or.. 

“He must be gay. I hope he is.”

Or

“[insert shallow comment about my sexuality here.]

I’m bi-sexual, but I don’t put that fact at the forefront of my personality. Because frankly, it’s the least important thing about me. 


I wanted to get some feedback here about this sort of thing. I’m still the only guy in my team, but the culture at my current place is, thankfully, a lot more professional. But I do still get the occasional jab. 

How do you guys feel about this sort of thing?

Also I’ve since gone on to win several awards and even won best florist in my city. 😎",1,1584971291,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fnk8os/how_do_you_feel_about_men_pursuing_career_paths/,AskWomen,1

fnk3cc,ImEducatingMyself,"Can a woman have an orgasm during sex, but still end up not enjoying that experience?","A month ago I was watching some amateur porn, 15 minutes of most boring fucking I've ever seen. There was a guy maybe in his thirties and woman in her early forties; no foreplay, no nothing, she gets undressed, lays on the bed and he's on top of her, penetrate her right away; and he's moving slowly and shallowly while laying on her, occasionally he would be a bit more rougher and she would start to moan louder. Her eyes are closed almost entire time. And this thing goes around 15 minutes, I'm just sitting and watching most boring, lustless and passionless fucking. At the end he's fucking her rougher and I'm not sure whether she's faking it, looks like she had an orgasm; he gets up, she's laying on the bed, eyes closed and her body is twitching.

All that made me wonder, we as a guys always have a burden of performance when it comes to sex, we are expected to perform good and gave a woman an orgasm, if we're even better even more of them. Sometimes it can make a lot of pressure on guys. What I'm wondering from that scene, it seems to me like she didn't enjoy having sex, and it left me wondering:

How do you wipe your front and back on the toilet?

How do you text on a phone? 

How do you not stab or slice you or your partner and bring anyone to tears in bed? 

How do you handle cooking, or even anything remotely manual out of fear of breaking them, etc ?

How do you effectively/properly clean underneath your nails, and how often?

And for God's sake... What's your secret to taking contacts out of your eyes?!?

fnfsuh,pearlyowl,When is it time to put myself put there and find love?,"Hello, I am [22F] and am constantly fighting a battle between what is safe, what I think I need, and societal expectations. 

I am a unicorn of inexperience - have not had my first kiss, have never been on a date, etc. I could go on and on explaining or making excuses about why but it all boils down to insecurity. 

Recently, I forced myself to face facts: I am stagnant and passive in my life. Feeling behind my peers as I got older fed back into my initial insecurities and now it’s even harder to put myself out there. Now, I am trying to take more initiative in trying new things, staying informed, and getting cultured. The hope is that the more I build my own identity, the more comfortable I am finding someone that I can start something with. 

FINALLY THE QUESTION: Am I crazy in wanting to work on myself for a couple years before making myself available? Or will I be considered an ‘old maid’ and should just put myself out there now?

We were talking about an ex employee that quit a few months prior and one of my coworkers was talking about how much she really didn't like him and he inspired her first Twitter post. Which read"" I would sell my soul to the feminist movement if it means I wouldn't have to hear the word pussy again"" or something along those lines.

So I asked what was wrong with the term. She said it was a derogatory slur against women's bodies and that when you say that you don't see a person you just see an object. She said no woman likes that word.

Now I won't lie I use the word to refer to a woman's vagina as well but, I thought it was just a playful word that people threw around.

fndguh,drosselmeyersdoll,"Needing help, woman to woman.","This post will probably sounds ridiculous, but it's been on my mind for years and driving me nuts. I need to just talk it out with people who dont know me. If that makes any sense. 

For a long time, I've felt like I am a somewhat failure as a female. I don't have any sense of style besides comfortable, my apartment looks like a college dorm threw up in it, and forget about things like makeup. It's a special day if I put on eyeliner, mascara, and lip tint. Most of my interests are on the weird side, and I'm terrible at making small talk or making people feel comfortable. Not to say I'm impolite or I dont know how to act if someone comes over, but unless the topic is something I know about or is interesting, I can't keep conversations going. I'm an absolute mess, can't keep anything organized or clean in my apartment. But my work desk is neat and orderly. 

This isn't to say I'm not a confident person. I am smart, successful, funny, have great friends and family, and I'm pretty happy with my life. I have bad days, especially if another friend enters a relationship or announces they're getting married, but I know that will come when it's supposed to. 

I know it's funny, but was there some ""How to be a Woman"" seminar you're supposed to attend as a teen and I missed the memo??

fn054h,bssacctforfinance,Posted this to AskMen as well but would love a female perspective. What should I do about this breakup that’s not really a break up but still a break up?,"I’m (25M) dealing with what feels like a break up again with my (25F) ex girlfriend

So I’m a little confused and just want a little clarity. We have been together for about 5 years. We broke up about a year ago because she felt as though I wasn’t committing enough time to her after she moved to my city. 

I had been dealing with a lot family issues, recently laid off, parents going through a divorce, etc. I felt as though I needed a little time to figure everything out and thought that it would take a little time to adjust after bringing our lives together. 

She tried to take back her break up and said that she was rash and impulsive and that she didn’t mean it. She apologized and tried getting back together but I said no as I was still in shock and it hurt to just be dropped like that amid everything else. 

We stayed in contact and eventually started having sex routinely within the next few months. Fast forward a little less than a year later and I had been doing better. I got a therapist that was awesome. Started antidepressants, found a new rewarding job and had made peace with my parents. I felt like I was ready to give us another try. 

However, she started being a little distant and I could feel it. So I asked her what was up and she confessed that she had began seeing someone else and she wants to see where it goes. I was taken aback I guess because I was in a mode to reconcile while she was dating someone else.

She said she didn’t want to hurt me and she felt as though she should be honest. She feels as though she just wants to be happy after not being happy for the past year. We spoke and I confessed that I had been in a mode of trying to reconcile. She says she loves me and she still thinks we will be together in the end. I told her, I loved her too and that I didn’t want to let her go because I was excited to be feeling like myself again. I knew I could be the man that she wanted and loved. She said that the only thing she ever wanted to hear and we almost had make up sex but decided not to. 

Following, she says she feels as though I’m too late. She waited so long to hear those words but it just feels like they are just words. Why did it take me so long to say them? Am I only saying them because someone else is in the picture? Why did I make her wait? I tried to explain my reasoning and everything that was going on. The progression I was making on my own. 

A couple days later we had our closure talk. She says that she doesn’t think it’s the end of us and that she thinks we will be together in the end. She says she still loves me and will always love me. Seeing the other guy makes her feel the feelings that she wished she had from me. And he just makes her feel like when we had started dating. She said he’s just like me and is just doing a lot of the things that she wanted me to do. She wants the best for me and that we just need to time/space to work on ourselves. I told her that I appreciated her for everything. I told her that I’m not holding anything against her and that when I think back on our relationship, I think of the good times and the fun times we had. I told her that whatever makes her happy is what I want in the end as I just want the best for her. I didn’t say that I wanted to get back together even though that’s what I want. We left it at that and now here I am. 

I’m confused and don’t know what to do or what to think. It feels like a break up even though we weren’t together. I feel betrayed and slightly angry that someone “stole” her from me or that I walked her right into his arms. I want to get back together but I know I’m too late in this instance. It’s also confusing that she says that she loves me and wanted to be with me and sees us together in the end, but still wants to see where things go with this guy because she just wants to feel happiness and appreciation right now. So what next? Any advice, clarity, perspective will be helpful. 

[TL;DR] Ex and I broke up but stayed in contact but now she found someone else. She still wants us to be together though in the end.",1,1584884471,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fn054h/posted_this_to_askmen_as_well_but_would_love_a/,AskWomen,1

fmzeya,--Baz--,How to make first move?,"Just a question.

How should I make a first move on a girl if we both somewhat like each other?

Information:
Im 17 and have liked this girl and we talk everyday and have met up many times. We r both inexperienced and she can be quite reserved and nervous when it comes to this (she's come over to mine to watch movies but never tries to make a move... so its up to me). I can be quite confident but i have no idea how to make a move without it being forced.

BACKSTORY...
So ive been talking to this girl over the past 4 - 5 months and im really starting to like her. We met at school event (i go to an all boys school) and i saw her and a couple of her friends in a small group and i decided to go over and talk to them, long story short i got her snapchat, she ended up inviting me to her school dinner and dance and we have been talking almost every day for the past 2 months. She has come over to my house a few times to watch movies, and ive met up with her and her friends many times on the weekend. We've met up almost every week for the past 6 weeks. Just for your information im very inexperienced when it comes to girls, the most ive done is hug and im 17 nearly 18, however, i am quite comfident... and i usually am talking about 70% and i hate awkward silence. So ive really wanted to progress the relationship but I dont know how. She is a very reserved and sometimes nervous girl and it takes her a little while to warm up when we meet. And im somewhat sure she feels similar because her best friend has told me that i need to make a move, but i just dont know how. I feel as if it would be forced if i tried to make a move... such as putting my arm around her, moving really close etc, i assume she isnt much experienced than me and isnt going to make the first move so its on me. I dont want her to lose interest either so im unsure what to do.

TL;DL
Im a 17 yr old somewhat inexperienced boy whose being seeing a girl over the past 2 months and has been talking to for about 4. I like her but dont know how to make the first move. She is very reserved and and would probably want me to make the first move. I dont know how to and dont want to force it, and also dont want her to lose interest. Please help me out guys it wpuld be much appreciated.",1,1584881228,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fmzeya/how_to_make_first_move/,AskWomen,1

She was a senior when I met her, and she was about 2-3 years older than me. I hated about everybody in the program that we were a part of, but she was the only people of about 20 that I didn’t dislike.... we were cool with each other.
I haven’t talked to her in At least 3 years and she graduated last year. 

Anyways, I got a job offer from the same company that she works at and I sent her a text to ask about the company. She enthusiastically texted me back! And asked if I wanted to have a phone call with her. I agreed.

She started off talking about the company, but she started to be honest about her experiences there and we actually had been through similar stuff in the corporate world. Also upon talking, we figured out that we have both built very successful careers (making 6 figures each out of school) and we have similar interests.

Anyway, the phone conversation lasted for about 45 minutes and at the end i said I’ll keep in contact and told her to let me know if she’s ever back on my campus.

I actually wouldn’t mind talking with her more and maybe going on a date, but I kinda don’t know where to take it from here. Am I out of my head for even thinking of her in this way, or is there some type of way that I can make something out of this? Should I text now or later and what...

fmt7y3,waterfire98726uw,My boyfriend (M/29) is on a dating app. I (F/24) am so hurt.,"&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and me are living together since a few weeks. I have to admit that I behaved a bit clingy because before we were long-distance. When he was not answering me straight away and answered his family and friends first I overreacted and called him out on it. It happened twice and I apologized. I knew he was busy and I was home all day long because of the Corona feeling extremely bored. At the same time I just cant trust him. I know it is not good to sneak into his Facebook, but thats where it all started. He frequently looked up other girls and there was also one girl he previously met, but never dated whom he looked up very frequently but also girls he does not talk to. A few days later I figured out that he sent her on his phone a message with ""I am at the dentist, calling you right back"". 

There was no chat story and phone story between them, he called her, she called back but they did not really talk. How did he knew he wanted to be called? Which means he deleted the phone call history or chat history between them, because it did not show that she called him or asked for calling him. They were on the phone on Facebook call for more than 15 minutes. On the same day I figured out that he was on the phone with another girl on the same day when I called him out on not responding to me while responding to other people. The chat history shows that they once video chatted before our relationship. She comes from a broken home and is recovering from meth. He told her in the video chat, before our relationship, that she has beautiful eyes, an amazing personality and a wonderful body. They did not chat that frequently, but she told him she loves him and that she is happy to have him as a friend. He told her that he loves her too.

 I talked with him about it and the first girl he was on the phone with wanted him to ""invite to her marriage"" in Israel, but she wants him to keep it secret, she would be in the same city and invited him to come with her friends. According to him, he told her that she has a girlfriend and will not meet up with her... But I am wondering why they were on the phone so long. He knows she wants something from him and the marriage thing is probably a lie from her to make him jealous. With the other girl he said that he really wanted to help her. He then told me he wont do it again. At the same time he told me that it is not his fault that the women love him.

A few days later we had a little fight and he said that I do not give him enough space and that I do not trust him...His ex girlfriend did not want to get back with him because she told him that she could never trust him since he was chatting with another girl on Facebook and that she know he betrayed her. So yes, I really do not trust him neither. Today I figured out that he still has his Jewish dating app on his phone and I logged into it. He did not respond to messages from other girls but four days ago he messaged a girl who now deleted her profile : ""I believe you"" and she answered with ""lol, thank you"". I do not know really know what it means since he texted her in Hebrew but that he texted a girl on a dating app is already enough for me. With another girl he texted four days after we came back together. He asked for her WhatsApp number and told her that he lives in America and if that would be ok for, since she is living in Israel. She said yes, it was always her dream to come to America. They never actually chatted on WhatsApp, since I am following his WhatsApp chat since a while... He also did not call her.

Today I asked him if he has trouble with commitments and if he talks to other women to kind of ""escape"" his main relationship. He said he is not talking to other girls while being in a relationship and he does not know how to answer it. He added that he is crazy about me and that he does not want to loose me. I asked him if I fulfill his emotional needs and he said yes. It is so strange. He does everything for me and even a few days ago we went and bought a car for me which goes under his name for financing. On the other hand, when I once felt really emotional, because I was not feeling well after a diner with his friends who only spoke Hebrew, he told me that he does not like me being so emotional and that it makes him insecure too when I tell him that I felt left out at the diner party. Yes, I felt left out due to my social anxiety, but I thought I could tell him. I told him that I try to not let it bother me what other people think of me and that I wont expect others to switch languages when I am the only one who cant speak it. It is my own insecurity and yes, I know have a hard time to trust and open up to other people... He gave me a second chance.

I am confused. Since I am about to convert to his religion, but he is still messaging a girl on a dating app, I cant understand that he is that religious but at the same time talks to girls behind my back. Maybe I am just too clingy and I really do not know what to do about it. He introduced me to his whole family, we even talked about marriage and kids. Does anyone has a good advice? And if I should be wrong about all of it, please tell your true perspective. I am open for any critics!

Since today I kind of cant look him in the eyes anymore, I feel hurt and I just want to go home back to Europe, but I am stuck here because of the Corona. It hurts me to think about packing my stuff, I cant tell him, because sneaking into his phone is as bad as his actions :( I try really hard not to cry around him... Leaving everything behind which I thought will be my future...He told me that without me he would be nothing. His brother said to me he was a wrack when we broke up the first time after I left him because of the distance between us. I want to trust him so badly, but something seems off with him. I want to go and be hurt for a while, it might be better than 20 years longer in the relationship and regretting not leaving, because I knew. He has a problem with his ego and is insecure, even if he does not cheat, he needs this constant validation... Can I help him with that or is it better to break up?",1,1584848186,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fmt7y3/my_boyfriend_m29_is_on_a_dating_app_i_f24_am_so/,AskWomen,1

Without getting into too much detail - I got into a ""situationship"", 6 months later we'd made it official but ended things about 2 months after that (summer 2019) due to his commitment issues. There were a lot of red flags in our relationship looking back, but while we were together he was a great companion.

The worst thing was the circumstances under which we broke up - as far as I knew we were happy as ever and he'd given no indication anything was wrong, he even told me he loved me about 2 weeks before things ended. So I had no idea, and I have existing trust issues which I am in therapy for - so ever since this all went down I've been completely closed off for fear of having my trust broken again.

Has anyone been through something similar - and if so, how have you been able to open yourself back up again outside of therapy?",1,1584844808,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fmse88/how_have_you_recovered_from_a_bad_breakup/,AskWomen,1

fms3rd,peachandpromise,How did you experience sexual attraction before you actually started having sex?,"Sorry, I'm really new to Reddit and don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I could really use some advice from other women.

I (21F) come from community/ethnic background that is religious and consequently very conservative in terms of sexuality. I am most likely to going to have an arranged marriage within the next few years (arranged, not forced! It's more like my parents setting me up on blind dates than anything else) and have never been in a relationship. This is not something that I have any problem with whatsoever, for the record. 

My religion heavily disapproves of any physical touch between unrelated men and women, and any kind of sexual or romantic contact (holding hands, kissing, actually having sex, etc.) is strictly forbidden before marriage. This means I won't have any romantic or sexual contact with my future fiancé until after we're married. Again, I am totally fine with this.

What worries me, though, is that I don't know if I experience sexual attraction. I think I do, but I don't really have anything to compare to. I've never masturbated, because I've never felt the need to. If I really try to imagine or visualize having sex then I feel a sort of tightening in my chest and what feels like a pulse between my legs, but that sensation is always very brief and disappears immediately after I start thinking about anything else. I don't watch porn, but the sex scenes I've seen in movies/TV shows have given me the same pulsing sensation that faded pretty quickly after the scene ended.

I don't know if this is something that will change once I am actually in a relationship and start having sex or if my sex drive is actually really low/nonexistent.

I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this, so I wanted to ask everyone here--is this normal? How did you experience sexual attraction before you actually had sex?

fmfqv7,-fallowfields-,Female Artist looking to talk to/observe women at work who engage in online sex-based work for an art project,"Hi, 

I know that this is a weird request and sounds fishy maybe, I've seen my fair share of male ""artists"" looking to get off and pretending it's something else, but I promise that isn't the goal here. 

I'm a female artist who's engaged in questions around femininity and invisible labor, and the role that performance plays in my experience of these things. In light of of everyone being under some level of COVID-19 quarantine right now, I find myself thinking about camming and remote domming, and how many women have found a place online to utilize socialized skills as women for a literal form of income/labor. If I want to just observe women engaged in that work, I can obviously pay for that labor and am happy to do so, but I'd also love to talk to anyone engaged in these work practices about their perspective when not at work so that I can better understand their experience of it.  I sincerely hope this conveys the level of utmost respect I feel for those who do this kind of work and isn't offensive to anyone, please DM me if you care to share your perspective and/or a link to where you work so that I can compensate accordingly with your permission to observe this these things in mind. When I say art project, also know that I would never use anyone's images without their consent, I'm thinking this will result in something much more abstract  and self-generated down the road, unless anyone wants to collaborate!

Thank you so much!",1,1584800809,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fmfqv7/female_artist_looking_to_talk_toobserve_women_at/,AskWomen,1

fmdleh,Leavesinthebreeze24,Is it normal for your body to get curvier in your early 20s? All responses welcome &lt;3,"Hello! I'm a healthy 23 year old lady in the UK, I eat moderately well and I exercise (tennis, jogging and walking), I'm 5""5 and 11st, and my measurements are 38-31-38 inches. So with this information you can see that I'm not the healthiest person in the world and I could probably do with losing a few pounds, but I'm alright. Doctors say I've nothing to be concerned about. I've been at these stats for about two years after overcoming an eating disorder. (When I was starving myself I was 36-28-36).

I find that a lot of my older clothes that I've had for years are tighter around the hips and waist. This makes my old ED brain flare up and worry that I'm getting fat. But.... I'm not? I don't think I am. I'm curvy and Thicc, but I'm not overweight. My booty has definitely enlarged itself but not to an outrageous extent, I just look more curvy these days.

This has been on my mind for quite some time and I am desperate to talk about it and find out if these changes are 'normal'. I need to reassure myself and stop the obsessive worrying. If I could get reassurance, perhaps I could finally let go of my old clothes and embrace my 'adult' figure. I want to finally kick my ED out of my brain. Unfortunately I don't have any older ladies in my life who I can ask about this.

So my question is: has anyone else experienced this change in their body in their early twenties, where you are a healthy size and shape but also inexplicably needing to buy bigger clothes?

fmbi8p,acuriousgowther,What are things you love your friend or crush to text you about? (Also what do you first text impressions to be like?),"I feel as though I cannot make good conversation with girls, especially via text. For a lot of them, they can respond almost instantly but will only give singular responses such as 😂😂😂 (crying laughing emojis) or ""lol""s. Maybe I’m supposed to continue with conversation afterwards but I actually don’t know what to talk about... maybe that’s the problem. Even when I get a wyd message it’s like they don’t actually want to know what I’m doing or want to talk about what they’re doing. I just want to have great conversations but then I can’t even tell if they’re into me or what. Eventually, from my terrible texting they will stop talking mid conversation even if they asked what I was doing. And my response can literally be literal and asking back to them. Is that boring? Is that not how you respond? 

I know people say girls are the same as guys but that’s not the same for me. If I talk to a guy they rarely give a single response and if they do they still keep the conversation going on their side to give me plenty material to keep it going. Now this is not all women, in my experience it’s like some of them do have long winded conversations.

fmbc39,ThrowRAobligation,Have you ever felt like your partner was only in a relationship with you out of obligation?,"For more detail and background, you can refer to my [Relationship_Advice post here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fmb2gl/im_concerned_about_something_my_boyfriend_m_24/), but the gist of it is that my boyfriend of over 3 years admitted this to me in couples counseling:


**Our counselor asked him if he does nice things because he wants to, or if he does it so he can be perceived as a nice guy.** He agreed that he mostly does to to *look* like a nice guy. He used an example of when I asked if he could come to the lakefront with me to keep an eye on me as I went kayaking for the first time, because i was nervous and it’s dangerous going alone in cold water. He said he didn’t want to, but knew he would look bad if he didn’t look after my safety. I know if I was in a situation where he asked me to spot him doing a dangerous activity, I would genuinely and intrinsically care about his safety, and not just do it out of social obligation. I think he might have been partially joking (he jokes nervously), but this was a bit of a shock. It also got me thinking of other situations where he seems to care more about being socially obligated to do things for me than actually wanting to do them. Celebrating holidays and anniversaries (he’d rather not), reciprocating intimacy (sometimes feels ungenuine and transactional), joining me to do things outside of the house (he’d really rather play videogames but will do it for me), working on personal growth (just wants to relax), play a videogame together (he only likes his specific videogames).

I’m concerned that the nice, kind man I started dating is only that way because it would make him look bad otherwise. I think he does truly love me, but I’m concerned many facets of our relationship for him might be done out of obligation. Of course I don’t want to JUST be an obligation, but I’m not entirely sure that this *isn’t* normal. To some extent we are all a product of social norms, and I know long-term love isn’t all fire and hot passion, but I’m not sure what the balance is between love and intrinsic motivation vs taking actions only fueled by anxiety in a healthy relationship. I’m not even really sure how to find out if this isn’t just me wrongly projecting, being wrongly paranoid, or his actual truth. I think if I asked directly he would deny it immediately. I now have this possibly irrational fear that maybe he’s unhappy with our relationship but knows since I’m nice, smart, funny, have a good job, and his parents strongly approve of me that it would look bad if he broke up with me, and would cause him a lot of anxiety. 

I'm not really sure how to open this dialogue. Has anyone else been in this situation on either side?",1,1584775786,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fmbc39/have_you_ever_felt_like_your_partner_was_only_in/,AskWomen,1

fma1k8,ImpossibleRise2,Does anyone need validation as much as me?,"u/impossiblerise230m
Seeking Validation
Hi guys,

I'm reaching out for any possible advice from people like me. Here's my issue:

I am constantly seeking validation and have a strong need to feel included. I'm 25F who has never been in a relationship and I dont have a best friend outside of my sister. I think this issue has gotten worse because I feel I am constantly worrying about getting validation from guys. I stress all the time about my looks because I haven't dated before and I'm scared no guy will ever want to like me (from my hair to body shape to skin. Literally everything). Several people in my family are in therapy (OT and PT) but I'm in the business field. They talk about therapy a lot and family go to them for advice, while I'm just the business person. I've been considering switching careers so I can feel more included. I don't know how to find friends or get over this insecurity that I'll never be loved or feel completely a part of a group. Because I always go along to get along in a group I don't even know what I like.

I think this originated in childhood. Even if friends were mean to me I would stay with them out of fear of loneliness. Some would call me plain or being then go hang out with others. I'm also a minority and have issues from feeling less attractive/liked by peers for that reason.

Has any else felt this way? How did you overcome it?",1,1584768452,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fma1k8/does_anyone_need_validation_as_much_as_me/,AskWomen,1

I regret not asking her out. 

So i made a throw-away-facebook (I dont do social media at all), requested her as a friend and sent her a dorky-message saying i regretted not talking to her more and asking her if she would like to catch up---text, email, etc

24 hours. No reply.

An example of what my profile looks like:
No profile photo.
User name: Gershom FromCostco

I have a pretty unique name, appeareance, and job title so im 90% percent sure if she read the profile name and message I sent she would know who it is.

Sooo..
24hrs. No Reply.

If im getting turned down, its cool but a simple 'no' would set me at ease since someone mentioned to me she may not have got the message if the account is fishy-looking and I might have ended in her facebook spam folder--- if thats a thing..idk

Shes a millenial so i figured even if shes not a constant facebook user (although from what i can or am allowed to see from her profile she seems kinda active with pics and posts from late February) she would get some kind of notification that I was trying to get her attention but idk

So.

AskWomen

Those of you who use facebook or are social-media-literate. Am i getting turned down? Is there a chance she didnt see it? Should i try again or do something else? Perhaps have someone with an established/active profile tell her to check her spam? What do you think is going on or what should I do?

fluvk4,OtterBoats,I thought a coworker of mine (24F) wasn't into me but now she keeps giving me (25M) mixed signals.,"I have a huge crush on a coworker of mine and we both work in an office, same department, same team.

She is an airhead, the kind of person who smiles and giggles most of the time and skips around the office in the best of moods. She is also studying to be a nurse and genuinely very attractive and athletic. However, she is also quite social and super friendly towards everyone, but mostly talks to me when she wants something. Usually snacks or food. 

What confuses me, is sometimes I will be on the phone with a client or just doing paperwork and she walks in and just takes snacks from my office or walks straight up to me and get in my personal space, her hip on my arm, and asks me for something. Sometimes poking me and wiggling her finger on my arm or back. I never see her do this with anyone else.

I understand just because a woman is nice to you, especially in the workplace, she isn't into you. But when it gets to the point of physical contact in the workplace and from the opposite gender, it's easy to get the wrong idea.

I just assume she's just being cute and manipulative to get things from me. But she can easily just ask me for something without touching me or being overly friendly. And I never make a move on her. Always a cordial hello, goodbye, plans for the weekend, etc. But usually stay away from her. 

I've asked another coworker of mine, a friend we both share, and she bluntly tells me to stay away from her and that she's trouble.

fluqbz,lololasticot,Advice concerning tool to educate and create support around consent and sexual abuse," Hey everyone! Hope everyone is safe and well!

**Some context**: We are a design team based in London currently working on a platform to educate, empower and support older teenagers and young adults, who have been identified to be at a heightened risk of sexual abuse and other related offenses. The project's intention is to bridge accessibility gaps to valuable resources and services preventing women to find the necessary help. By creating a platform we are aiming to help women to better comprehend their rights, identify situations of sexual abuse and to find support to tackle the issue.

**What we would like to know is what you think would be the best platform (toolkit, app, website, educational program, chatbot…) to access that kind of information?**

**And what did you wish you knew about consent and sexual abuse or what would you like to know?**

If any of you who has any kind of experience with the issue and is willing to answer a few questions privately that would be extremely helpful as well!

Every Friday, just say whatever is in your mind in this post. It doesn’t need to be a question, and go on whatever tangent you want to go on.

We will still be enforcing our rules on gendered slurs, bigoted/disrespectful/hateful commentary, invalidation (this won’t work if someone’s only contribution is telling others they are wrong), and asking relationship advice but the comments don’t need to be on a specific topic, and they don’t need to be open-ended questions.

flrzyx,Trsoki911,Relationship advice,"We’re in a loveless relationship, we are in what’ve named a situationship which would make more sense sooner than later. 

I was regarded as a philanderer of note in my younger yrs, met a lady 10yrs my junior and we hit it off and a year later she was pregnant. We have a son who is six now, and we are living together as a family. 

The issue is there’s no love anymore between us because I cheated on her a couple of years ago and after apologizing she forgave me but every time we have an argument she brings it up which means she clearly hasn’t healed or moved on. This is two years after the incident and I’m not sure how to feel about it I have even asked that we brake up but she refuses because she doesn’t want our son raised differently than how we both did. We are still very much intimate, but can you imagine how cold that must be for a woman to be spending so much time and energy on a man she refuses to brake up with but clearly doesn’t love anymore? I messed up and I would give so much for my son not to see me as the person who hurt his mom but that wasn’t about her/him but my pursuit of what I deemed happiness. 

I have been committed to her ever since but it seems I committed too late. I am hoping that we can find way to coparent because I want to feel loved and appreciated again like she once made me feel. 

My question is, am I selfish in thinking two years is enough for a person to heal? I really love her now but I don’t want to waste time on trying to fix something that we might never fix. When we have this discussion, she just says you’re a wonderful father and a crappy partner but I’m willing to live with that and will all the benefits except the emotional attachment. How is that even possible?

flr7en,jenken221,Period Cramps,"I have PCOS. Just started on the pill again. I wanted to see if I had any other options to regulate my period besides birth control because I don’t like how I feel when I take birth control. Anyhow. If I’m not taking birth control I just spot all the time and one time I ended up not having a period but spotting every day for like 3 months. Anyhow. All of this back story is leading to a point I promise. I’m starting my period and I have been cramping basically this entire week. It’s kind of killing me because it’s sporadic and also my electric heating pad had to be thrown away because the controller broke and anytime I tried to turn it on it smelled like it was burning.😭
Anyone got any hacks to deal with period cramps? I want to get a new heating pad but I’m short on money and I don’t think the Safeway in my hometown would sell them so I would have to travel 30 minutes to Walmart. Which isn’t too terrible but it just doesn’t feel like a feasible option and rice babies feel like a waste of rice and a lot of effort.😂🙈

She didn't tell me that she went until after. I told her to come over so we could hang out and if she wanted we could talk. When she walked in I noticed she was walking funny. I asked what was wrong and at first she denied everything, but later opened up. She told me that when she went to his house he really hurt her. At first she wouldn't say what he did, but eventually she did. She told me that he took a knife to her vagina and cut her. Immediately I wanted to call an older friend of ours but she refused and got defensive. I told her I wouldn't call. But that we should do something about it. She refused everything I suggested from calling police, going to the hospital, calling an advocate, even calling a telemedicine doctor.

I know we’ll be fine, I just miss him. I know there are more serious issues obviously but I’m wondering if anyone is going through the same thing. This whole thing sucks.

fkootc,3v3r9r33n,Hormonal contraception and orgasms - help!?,"Cross posted to a few places and also on mobile so apologies for that etc etc.

Has anyone experienced difficulty/inability reaching orgasm when on hormonal contraception? Long story short; I switched from a POP to a combination pill a few months ago and since then it's taking me aaaages to orgasm even when I'm masturbating. I thought maybe I needed a bit more stimulation so tried a bullet and no improvement. Even bought a wand to see if the extra power would help but it even takes a good 10-15 mins with that, when i used to be able to get off in under 5 mins easily with just my hand and less than a minute with a vibrator.

I know antidepressants can cause this, but has anyone ever heard of contraceptives doing it too? I have no problem whatsoever with my sex drive, it's just as high as ever, I just can't seem to orgasm and it's getting quite annoying. 

If anyone else has experienced this, did changing pills help?

Today, he messaged me saying that someone that he was talking to a while ago has recently come back into his life. It's nothing at the moment but could be something in the future so our little fwb might be short lived.

fkm4n6,fatallyuseless,A question from a husband.,"I've been married for going on 25 years.
Started out as a very one sided relationship, she was in a very bad place. Recovering from a divorce due to cheating and a suprise pregnancy from a rebound hook up. She had 4 children, 3 from her ex, 1 from the hook up. Aged 6-1. I have one from a previous as well.
She was diagnosed with bipolar and depression.  Had anger issues of which I took the brunt to shield the kids. This went on for about 10 years. I know I was a glutton for punishment it seems, but I loved her then and still do, more importantly I fell real hard for the kids. They were my life, keeping them all sorted out during all this was rough, I went from a single weekend father to a full house overnight. 
I do not regret one minute. 
All the kids are now grown with families of thier own.
Where am I going with this.....hm...
I realised within the first 2 years I was her safe bet, I was purely settled for because I was there. It took me years to move past this on my own because i never wanted to hurt her with how it hurt me.
I was never a looker, was out of shape, but i worked hard, was always looking inward and upward for better jobs until I finally got a great one. 
She is beautiful,  always has been.
I know she loves me now fully and completely.  I really do, but for those of you who settled for a safe bet, who knew you could do better if you had tried,
Why? How long did it take you to fall in love with him for real,  or have you ever?
I guess I'm just asking because I would like to find a little peace. 
I believe if I asked my wife she would not really be able to answer. She was so mentally broken that it took 10 years or so to fix her. I dont think she remembers alot of the angry and hateful things she said and it would be painful to try and bring it up.
So I will ask the married ladies of reddit who settled.
Thank you in advance.",1,1584519276,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fkm4n6/a_question_from_a_husband/,AskWomen,1

fkkh1e,lilfrank101,Why is extremely easy for women to have an orgasm with a certain guy?,"So I have this ex who's now my best friend, who I occasionally fuck. 

We have a very open relationship, to the point where we tell each other about our hook up stories in maybe too much details. 

Anyways, we're fooling around today. Nothing too crazy, just us making out and her grinding on me with my one leg in between hers. Not even 10 minutes pass and she tells me that she came. 

Not the first time this has happened. Thing is, she's said that she RARELY cums while having sex with anyone else. Like she would get really horny and really enjoy the experience but never actually have an orgasm. Now I get a big head and ask her if it's because my stroke game is on point.

Ladies. This woman says no with a stone cold face face. She says to me, she says ""Your stoke is not really rhythmic"" 

So I ask her why it's so easy to have an orgasm, and she couldn't really tell me. I'm thinking it's comfortability, but she has like 2 other FWB she's super comfortable with and really sexually attractive to, and shes still not quite able to cum with them. 

Then I thought it was because I was on the bigger side, penis wise. But that doesn't make sense because she's came without my penis being involved countless times.

I've been wrapping my head around it, and obviously neither me nor her have insight on it that we can definitely put our finger on, so wanted to hear you guy's thoughts.

And just nip this in the bud now:

- im 100% positive she doesn't secretly have feelings for me, and vice versa. She dumped me and we both think we're  better friends.

-im 100% positive she's not lying. I don't pester her and ask if she came. She's always told me in a matter of fact way, and I'm usually surprised only because she would come before we even got to do more than light petting. She's also roasted me in how I have sex, so she has no qualms in being straight up.",1,1584509640,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fkkh1e/why_is_extremely_easy_for_women_to_have_an_orgasm/,AskWomen,1

It was like I’d never left. Had to leave again, been stationed in California, North Carolina and now Okinawa japan. been in the corps over a year and a half now, I’ve been in relationships and had meaningless sex with too many women trying to fill the gap.it never feels right though, it feels fake to me, like I’m watching a romance movie, and never works out. we’ve both stayed in contact like I’m home and she tells me she loves me but somehow she seems distant and almost uninterested the few times I’ve been able to see her.

Well he did and this time I confronted him he promise to never do it again I even mentioned Bc he has two older sisters would he like it if someone treated his sister or mom like this and then he snapped a realized what he was doing was so wrong 
Fast forward to now he is so reassuring and the best boyfriend possible he really didn’t take the second chance for granted but I feel the situation really messed me up like I was already crazy from my last and now this I just feel so traumatized by it and I feel like I can trust him but I don’t trust other girls talking with him.

fjgnlt,FriendlyPoro,My beloved one (F23) left me (M26) after 7 years," 

We have a child (M6) and we've shared everything for the last 7 years.

Within our relationship I developed an addiction to pot. I used to smoke all the time and I'd mostly be at home at all times. 

My addiction got out of hand and I was only doing stuff that included pot in one way or another.

I didn't go to park with them, nor did I do anything I've should have done.

It  wasn't always like that, I did develop the addiction over the years and  towards our break-up it was dominating everything in my life.

I didn't have energy to take my kid to kindergarden and so on.

3  weeks ago, she sat down with me and she break the news. She told me,  that she doesn't love me anymore and yet, she was sobbing to tell me.

I didn't react on it in any way, I felt like I've died. I felt absolutely nothing.

The next day it hit me and I tried to talk with her on order to know what went wrong.

She  wasn't telling me anything, she just said that it's how she feels. I  did question her about it and found out that my addiction did hurt her  badly.

I started to thinking myself, what I've  done and I realized that I didn't pay enough attention on what she was  saying to me during our relationship.

I was only concerned about pot.

I  didn't go to hobbies, if playing videogames doesnt count. I didn't go  out with friends, and I've made her my only intrest (after pot ofc) and I  didn't want anything else from life than her love.

I was insecure and behaving badly when other males we're around. I didn't see anything when I was so high all the time.

So,  after the breakup I searched my true self, and started to make things  happen instead of lying on the sofa and talking about doing stuff.

I loved to talk about doing stuff, but rarely did I have real intentions about doing those things.

3  days after the breakup I managed to get my shit together. It was pretty  hard, as we live together and we basically see each other on daily  basis.

I didn't go to barber shop nor did I  brush my teeth on daily basis. I had piles of old clothing which I never  used. I used to use the same clothes from 2 to 4 days. 

The  day after the breakup I asked her wether or not she'd belive that I've  could have changed If she'd just had told me how she felt. She told me  no, and said that the reason why she didn't tell me how she felt about  my smoking because she thought that its so important thing for me.

So I realized how exhausted she was at that point.

I  quit smoking pot on the 3rd day after the breakup. I started to taking  care of myself and went to the barbershop, I started to go out, have fun  and take care of my other social relationships.

I started the boxing.

I started to take care of our kid and our home.

I  started brushing my teeth 2 times a day like a normal person would. I  was finally able to take care of myself, and be the real me.

Couple of days went by, and we didn't have any communication what so ever.

She did contact me when she'd need me to take care of the kid and so on, but nothing else.

The I asked her for a coffee, not to talk about our history or any of those negative things that made her feel bad.

I did put on my best outfit and I was finally feeling confident. I felt like, I deserve to be happy.

The  coffee went ok, we did talk about our future apartments and laughed off  to those ugly a\*s apartments that we had looked to move to.

Then  she said ""You've got a haircut"" which I replied to: "" Yeah"" and she  said that: ""you never took a haircut before"" and I gave her the same  reply.

Later that day we were eating, me, ex and the kid.

At some point she said to the kid: ""daddy looks different now doesnt he""

I felt so flattered for the attention she gave me.

I have been able to make her laugh on every occasion we share, every conversation is much less stressful now. 

Some  days ago we went for a short walk, and she showed me some acrobatics  she had recently learned. I did compliment her, and we talked about how  are things going right now.

I've started to  meet my friends again and started to spend time outside of our house. I  got an hobby, and social life which I was lacking for years.

I've  finally managed to get over with my addiction for pot (19 days sober as  today) and I've started to take care of myself. Eating healthy,  exercicing, socializing.

But what she told me, made me think even more than before.

She  told me that she hasnt been doing much with her life, she told that:""  same old s\*it in work"" and that she is basically doing the same exact  things she used to do when we were a couple.

It made me  further question about her decision to breakup with me. If she felt like  life was boring and dull with me, why did she keep up doing those same  old things afterwards? 

She didn't even throw away the ring I've bought her. She did put it in her handbag.

So, she gave me no reason for the breakup.

I realized most of my mistakes.

I realized that I wasn't the man I used to be.

I  changed from an masculine man to a insecure, clingy stay-home-dad which  didn't want anything from a life besides being with her.

Still,  I love her and I cant think of my life without her. She wasnt in a  relationship with me, she was in a relationship with a man which I've  become over the years.

Now she keeps asking me  to come home from where ever I am, so that she could go for a jog, for  her hobbies and so on. I think she cant handle the fact that I've really  changed.

I am motivated to charm her again. I feel a little bit of spark between us. After the breakup both of us have been working for our looks and our own well-being. She has lost some weight and I've been hitting a gym. The way she looks at me tells me that there is something she feels towards me.  
Today she is moving out of our apartment. I promised earlier that I'd help her with that.   
Yesterday she asked me, ""is it going to be awkward?"" and I asked her, why would it be. She told me that she doesn't know, she was just thinking. So should I just let her move on her own or should I be there for her?  


Should I wait for her to reconcile of try to do it myself?

tl;dr she left me and told no reason for it. Should I keep on trying or just ignore her for the rest of my life",1,1584341324,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fjgnlt/my_beloved_one_f23_left_me_m26_after_7_years/,AskWomen,1

fjgbau,survivorthrowaway11,My boyfriend has been giving me yeast infections for 3 years. I know he’s the source but I’m not getting any answers and it’s driving me crazy.,"My boyfriend was my first sexual partner in 2017 and was my only sexual partner until a breakup in 2019.

I got my first yeast infection in my life during a sexual encounter with my boyfriend. I would get them treated just to get them again every time we were intimate. It wasn’t even PIV sex and I was getting them. Then we started engaging in PIV sex and I continued to get them. It was really frustrating and embarrassing. I never told him what I was dealing with because I thought it was something wrong with me.  

I had a revelation that he was the source when I started to have other sexual partners and I never got a yeast infection- ever. When we reconciled I finally told him I was dealing with recurring yeast infections and that I was pretty sure he’s the source. He said that his ex gf got them frequently and it caused issues in their sex life.

Honestly I was pretty upset. He knew there was an issue but didn’t do anything to rectify it and for over 2 years I thought my vagina was broken. He told me he thought he had oral thrush and that he would go to a doctor. Went to the doctor, came back with no diagnosis and no medication. 

Unrelated breakup again, I’m yeast infection free. We get back together and I’m reluctant to be intimate. I am, I get it again. I treat it. I tell him he needs to go to the doctor and figure this out. He says he will, he doesn’t. We’re intimate again, I get it again. 

I’m at my wits end. I recognize this is probably a point of frustration for him given that he did go to get tested for yeast overgrowth and it came back negative. However, he’s not doing enough. And then after we’re intimate he has the nerve to ask if I’m itching, then gives an empty apology when I tell him yes, I do have another yeast infection. 

Everything I’ve read told me if a man has a yeast infection he shows symptoms (my boyfriend doesn’t), that it’s unlikely to pass it on to a female partner, that it’s probably an issue with me. Even my doctor suggested it was a gynecological issue. 

I’m hoping someone has experience with this or any advice to extend because I feel like the information of male yeast infections is so limited and it’s driving me crazy. I love my boyfriend and I don’t want to end our relationship, but I cannot deal with recurring yeast infections anymore.",1,1584339343,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fjgbau/my_boyfriend_has_been_giving_me_yeast_infections/,AskWomen,1

fjg4w2,surfergirl106,I (19F) am in a negative headspace and don’t know how to overcome it.,"Hey all. So lately, I have been in a very weird and melancholy headspace. About a month ago, I (19F) experienced a very painful breakup; he and I were dating for about a year when I had found out he was active on Tinder during our relationship, which resulted in me ending things between us. The feelings of betrayal and the loss of him from my life has been extremely difficult for me to cope with, however, with the coronavirus situation on top of it, I just feel like my life is completely turning upside down and falling apart. I don’t have any solid friends, I spend most days alone, my family is going through major conflict, I am unable to go to the gym because I don’t want to put my parents at risk for getting infected (I live with them), and I just, in general, feel really out of touch with myself as well as self-hatred and dissatisfaction with my life. Just last year, my relationship was going well, I had many friends, was getting good grades, felt content, but now all that has changed and I feel like I’m slowly spiraling. And witnessing all these sad things going on in the world right now has only made me fall deeper and deeper into this bad headspace. I’m trying to see things from a positive outlook as I know I have a lot to be grateful for but it’s been very hard. How do I get myself out of this rut and shift my negative mindset to a positive one? 

TL;DR: I am going through a rut and need some tips and advice on how to get out of it.",1,1584338389,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fjg4w2/i_19f_am_in_a_negative_headspace_and_dont_know/,AskWomen,1

My best friend for 6 years got a girlfriend about 3 months ago and she has never liked how close me and him are.(I’m a girl) I have a boyfriend and I’m very happy with him and she knows that, my friend has had to reassure her multiple times that there is nothing going on between me and him but she won’t believe it. I just found out that he lets her read our chats because she is so insecure and doesn’t trust him. I can barely call him anymore without her getting dramatic and he told me that she has even cried for about two hours after she saw us texting on messenger. She won’t talk to me, I’ve tried to be nice to her but all I get in return is her practically yelling at me(on a call) and being very rude and mean and he lets her treat me like that. When I ask her why she dislikes me so much she says she doesn’t have to tell me. I’ve done everything I can to have a normal friendship with him but I’m exhausted. Should I cut them off or continue in this very dramatic situation? I also feel like I should mention that this is a long distance friendship so I haven’t even met her. Ofc it’s normal for him to be a little more distant now since he’s in a relationship but I feel like I’ve completely lost my friend but I can also see how much this affects him, he hates this situation and I feel for him.

fj14je,besieged_mind,How to overcome a rejection from a friend?,"I have been secretly in love with a girl for a few years, since the final year of college. We started to hang out, there was a mutual connection, even our colleagues saw we are always together and one close female friend of mine told me that girl definitely likes me. The only problem was she had a long time  boyfriend so I thought I don't know... Never asked her out, never told my feelings. 

We finished college, stayed in the same city, but our contact was very limited. A few years passed by and from her social media I understood she is not in relationship anymore. 

I have reached out to her a few months ago, we started going out, regularly texting each other, getting closer again etc. She liked my company, she could have easily said no or ghosted me, but she did not. 

Last week I asked her out and used such a subtle form she definitely did understand as a romantic encounter and not just going out for a drink. We had a few drinks, talked for a few hours in a bar, and when we got out, I told her my feelings and that I like her a lot. 

I got rejected and she told she was suspecting I am in love with her, although I have never said anything. So, basically, the answer I got is that she likes our conversations, but she does not see me that way and there is no chance of us being together. 

Period. It was not even the polite rejection, no smile, no word of support, clarification or comfort since then - especially since she suspects I have a very hard family situation, which I do - no message she still likes me as a friend etc. I can not look her that way, so our relationship is most probably over, but like... 

If you don't want to me to stay friends (never reached out after she told me no), if you don't like me as a boyfriend, why would you start interacting at all? Both then and now? Especially since she obviously guessed I have feelings for her. 

I feel both confused, hurt, and like cheated. 

There were girls who were interested in me during college and I saw with my bare eyes she took me under her wing and ran them off. She started interacting with me again, she told me about some mental problems she had and liked the way I listened and accepted them, although I was pretty surprised to hear about them. 

And now she just gave me a hard NO and does not even bother to reach out and ask how I feel. 

I am so confused because I both like her as a female and a person, and dislike her because of the way she is handling this, and planning to get her over as quickly as I can since this is not going anywhere, and not realising what the fuck is happening besides her obviously saying NO (I still hear her voice in my head).

fj0equ,mazgraz,At what point can a (male) colleague's undermining behaviour be deemed unacceptable?," I'll try and keep this succinct but I think I'll probably fail! I would really appreciate some advice because I'm pretty upset right now.

For context: I'm a master's student, and I have an RA-type job as a welfare advisor where I live and work in student halls. It's a team of five people (+2 coordinators), so as you can imagine when problems in the team arise it hits quite close to home.

There's a guy at my job who started at the same time as me who I find absolutely insufferable. At first I thought it was just his personality, which is unfortunate but not something you can do anything about, but things have come to more of a head and I'm beginning to wonder if that's still the case.

I'm quite shy, but I've always considered myself to be pretty proficient at holding conversations and debates, and I have a number of academic accolades that mean that even my imposter syndrome can't make me feel like I'm unintelligent. Before meeting this dude, I've never before felt like I'm intellectually inadequate, but this guy makes me feel so fucking stupid in the way he interacts with me. He has this air of disdain in response to everything I say, and will pick apart any comment that I make in a way that feels incredibly undermining- and I haven't noticed him doing this with anyone else on my team. It might be worth noting that I'm one of two women on this team- this guy is 8 years older or so- and the other woman is already doing a phd, same as this guy. I'm also pretty much the only member of the team with a semi-regional accent. I don't know if this is just me projecting my own insecurities onto this situation, but I honestly dread every interaction I have with this guy because I always come away feeling shitty about myself. And these are really not insecurities I normally have, and this is not a way that I've felt with anyone else I've ever met.

However, as time's gone on it feels more personal than this guy just having a bit of a shitty personality. He keeps on doing this thing where he'll say something where it's impossible to tell if he's telling the truth or not, and then if you believe him he'll act like you're stupid for being gullible. He's made ""joking"" comments referring to me and one of my other collegues as libtards, and if I ever need to hand something over to him or liase with him 1-1 he'll just take whatever item we're exchanging and shut the door in my face, or hang up on the phone abruptly. The other day I was running an event for the students where I gave out plants and had a petition involving local environmental democracy to sign, and he walked by audibly laughing at me and my event in front of the students, which was incredibly undermining (not surprisingly, he thinks it's stupid that I campaign against climate change on a local level in our city).

But this has truly come to a head this morning (and sorry but I need to give some more context)- I'm immunocompromised, and over the weekend I had to go to hospital for a precautionary checkup because I had some slightly scary symptoms that were adjacent to coronavirus. The doctors confirmed that I definitely didn't have coronavirus, and that these were other symptoms from a mild viral infection that my immune system couldn't shake off, but I was told to self isolate where possible for my own health because I'm in an at risk group for the virus. Due to a situation that happened in our halls I ended up disclosing to this guy that I was self isolating, and over messenger I explained why, and asked him to not spread this information around because I didn't want to cause unnecessary panic for anyone who's been in contact with me- information can get misconstrued, and I don't want anyone thinking I have coronavirus when I absolutely don't. He then started having a go at me, saying ""and yet \[I was\] quite happy to tell him that I was self isolating"", and that I needed to tell my managers. I responded saying that I already had, and said that he didn't need to act like I was being irresponsible in who I was telling, especially because I was isolating for my own health and not because I was at risk of passing the virus onto others. He then responded saying ""Shut up, you're not the only one with an underlying health condition"", and I just said that I didn't understand why he was being so rude to me because it was completely unnecessary. He then blocked/muted me on facebook, so I couldn't send any more messages (not that I particularly wanted to).

So I don't think it's unreasonable for me to assume that for some reason, this guy absolutely hates my guts. I could deal with pretty much everything else but this is the final straw, especially after having a pretty traumatic weekend where I had to go to hospital, and I've just been alone in my flat properly crying about this. I'm so torn over what to do, because I want to speak to my managers about his behaviour- they can be a bit useless in terms of their organisation and efficiency at accomplishing things, but they're generally quite empathetic people. The problem is that if I tell them about this and show them these messages I don't want it to look like I'm telling tales on him like we're in primary school.

I've tried to give as honest an account of this as I can- does this seem like just someone's unpleasant personality that I should just put up with, or something more untoward because this treatment feels very personal? I work and live in close proximity to this guy, and I don't know how much longer I can put up with this.",1,1584274156,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fj0equ/at_what_point_can_a_male_colleagues_undermining/,AskWomen,1

fj097d,Kyoko98,Is it over.,"I was dating this guy for a couple of months, but we had known each other for 3 years. We had so much in common, I mean he was a gamer I was gamer, he loved anime I loved anime whenever we were together we could talk about anything. When I met him he had a  girlfriend, I tried to distance myself from him but I couldn’t because I liked him so much. So one day we were play Xbox and we were chatting over the mike. We was having a lil debate about a anime topic and every time I would say something to him the girl he was with would jump in and just start talking. I got jealous and told him a lie that I had smoked with a couple of friends, even though I didn’t. He was angry about it and told me that I was messed up because he wanted to be the first to person that I smoked with. After som time him and the girl break up and we start dating. Everything is all good until we have these little argument and in every argument he brings up the smoking situation, he keeps telling me that I’m messed up, I’m selfish and that he’s never gonna do anything new with me. So last night we had a argument and again he brought up the smoking situation, I couldn’t take it anymore he kept bringing in up in every argument so I finally told him that it was all a lie. I told him the reason I said that to home was because I was jealous and that I didn’t like how that girl back then was doing.  Now he tells me that he doesn’t know if he can be with me, that he should have know Aquarius are all liars(that me btw). I admitted to him that I was wrong and I shouldn’t have done something like that. Now he won’t answer my calls or text messages. I know I was wrong and I am truly and deeply sorry about this.

fiz17k,invisiface,Verbal abuse,"Got a friend who is being verbally abused by her boyfriend. I’ve seen it firsthand- he does it in front of me and I’m just at a loss what to do. It’s like he doesn’t even think what he’s doing is wrong. 

I never really noticed when I would go to their social gatherings. But when I spent time with them outside of a party setting it’s a little disturbing now integrated the abuse seems in their normal life. 

He calls her stupid and dumb. He berates her and curses at her. He blames her for things that aren’t her fault. I could almost understand if they were both constantly fighting and insulting each other (not that it would be right)- but she just lets him speak to her like that. She even apologizes and speaks softly to him and he will go on and on. 

 She came to me once while I was there at night and just fell on me crying while he told me “this fucking idiot wants to go out.” Now granted she wanted to drive and we had all been drinking. I told her it was a bad idea and then she agreed she wouldn’t go. But he kept going on and on saying how fucking stupid she was and she always acts like an idiot. I had to tell him enough was enough and she wasn’t going so it was over. He went grumbling to their room. 

She’s talked to him about seeing a therapist or going to anger management but as far as I can tell that’s going no where. 

I honestly don’t know what to do. While I’m seeing it happen I want to tell him to back off and stop talking to her like that- ok I really want to deck him- but I don’t want to fan fire on the flames and I don’t know how much of my place it is to tell him something. I’ve told her I don’t like the way he speaks to her. She says she doesn’t like it either. 

I’m hoping this can be resolved or she walks away. I want to do something but I don’t know what to do or if I can do anything.

fix85h,TerribleAuthor7,Is he hopeless?,"Hi, ladies. 

This is going to be a bit long you can skip to the TL;DR portion at the end if you'd like, or you can read the full story if you have time. I appreciate you taking the time to go through this post either way. 

So, here is a back story I'll try to make it as brief as I can, I met this person 2 years ago we both were working abroad and we both come from different countries. Our relationship went from colleague/formal relationship and it progressed to us sleeping with each other. During that time we weren't officially together or anything but I had a crush on him, and I presumed he had feelings for me too. Things were either hot or cold between us, we would spend time together and go on short trips occasionally but once we would be back to the city we both worked in, things would quickly change he would get moody? He would do things like disappearing at parties we both went to, cancel any plans we might have coming up last minute, sometimes he would seem too busy to respond or text back then everything would be back to normal. He would text, respond, be willing to meet, etc. 

I started hearing rumors that he was sleeping around with other coworkers, I was very hurt and upset by that. Later on, I confronted him about it and he said that he did indeed sleep with these other women. I let it slide because we weren't officially seeing each other. 

I decided to leave my job in that country and focus on my education (going back to school), he was leaving too to go back to his own country and purse another career back home. I thought we wouldn't meet each other again and we didn't get to see each other. He was busy and I was too. 

However, after he left I dk why I decided to call him and ask him if he ever cared about me. He said yes he always cared about me, he always had feelings for me, he just didn't know how to express them properly but he wants to be with me. He also told me to go live with him in his country, he's a US citizen, however, since the immigration process is lengthy I won't be able to do that right away and he isn't willing to sponsor me yet. He wants me to get a tourist visa so I can go see him. 

He says we are together but I found out he was seeing other women (our ex-coworker) since they are both US citizens. It's one of the coworkers he had a fling with before. He lied in the beginning about how there was nothing going on, but then he admitted to sleeping with her. However, since we weren't officially together I let it slide. 

I'm starting to doubt whether he actually wants to be with me, I think he might be lying to me. I don't know why would he lie? I love him and want to have a relationship with him but I hope he is being truthful and isn't just wasting my time. 

I hope you guys can give me insight into what I can do at the moment. I have put my education on hold right now because I'm trying really hard to get my certificate to practice in the US and I need to pass the exam for it. I'm also working hard to go there legally and be with him. 

TL;DR: My long-distance boyfriend is meeting other women behind my back he says he stopped but I can't believe him. I also have no way of knowing what is happening because we are in different countries. I am doing my best to get the visa to go see him but he isn't willing to sponsor me yet. He wants me to work on this visa issue myself. I love him and I want a relationship with him however, he can be moody at times.

fiwql8,Ariesgirl24,How can he cheat on someone he always saying he loves?,"My boss and owner of where I work at is a45 years old, his wife is the same age. He has a wife, been married for 5 years and kids. He is a very dedicated family man, is even always posting about how he loves his on Instagram, always saying good things about her. Spending time with the family, would do anything for them.  At our shop we had a 21 year old customer, very beautiful woman. And she was my client, he flirted with her boldly in front of us, rubbing on her thighs. Telling her he wanted to bring her home to have sex while his family was gone. But she declined. He gave her his number. I found out 2 weeks later that he got involved in a FWB relationship with her. Was honest to her about being married, even talks about his wife casually with her like it’s no big deal that he’s cheating at all. He’s always telling the 21 year old how much he wants her sexually, and doesn’t want her having sex with anyone but him. They can’t keep their hands of off each other, he talks about how passionate the sex is. How can he love his wife and would do anything for her but cheat? And I’m positive his wife doesn’t know, I’ve known her for years. His wife recently went crazy on him for coming home at 2am after meeting with the girl to have sex. I thought he would stop but he just told the girl that he needs to lay for awhile cause his wife is trippin.

fiv98p,getin_thebin,Do I have a UTI?,"Sorry if this is a stupid question or this is the wrong subreddit. This is the only one that came to mind, and I can’t get tested until Tuesday. 

I 17F only recently lost my virginity about two weeks ago. I noticed the day after that my pee had a funny scent before that I had never noticed, and it continued for the entirety of that week, all of which I had been engaging in sexual activity almost every day. When I stopped for a while though, so did the funny smell. I thought nothing of it and haven’t had sex since.

A couple days ago, the next symptom started to kick in, that being that a few times every day for the last four days or so, I’ve been getting insane urges to pee, like run to the bathroom or I’m gonna piss my pants kinda pee, only for the tiniest amount to actually come out. It’s very frustrating and I literally find myself crossing my legs aggressively in public just to make sure I don’t pee myself. 

The reason I question whether or not this is a UTI though, is that other than these two things, I haven’t had any of the other symptoms. No abdominal cramping, no fever or chills, no burning sensation while I’m peeing, none of that. 

What do you think, women of reddit? Is this a urinary tract infection? I plan to get it checked out soon anyway, since left untreated, UTI’s can be so dangerous. I just wanted to read some advice before I do so. Thank you so much in advance:)",1,1584243657,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fiv98p/do_i_have_a_uti/,AskWomen,1

fiuz1k,autumnphoebe1,Dianette (birth control)/depression/acne/side effects?,"Hi everyone so .. I am 19 years old currently and when I was about 13/14 I wasn’t really conscious to the fact I had really really bad acne. When I look back at photos now it amazes me how it didn’t effect me emotionally or anything. However, something must of happened because I think it was a few months before my 14th birthday I realised how bad my skin was and people at school started to say things or point it out and i was so embarrassed to the point where I’d cover my face in anything I could to try get rid of them or hide them. I finally went to the doctors, tried a few different things and there was a liquid in a bottle that sort of burned when you put it on your skin and it had a grey sponge like applicator. I remember thinking it worked well but then the doctor said they didn’t know what I was talking about and I’d lost the bottle so I couldn’t even remember the name of it! After this conversation where I was made to feel insane they said why don’t you try dianette it’s amazing for acne so obviously I was like yes something that’s going to make them vanish for good! I was told about the risks and stuff which I obviously didn’t listen to because I was 13 and so excited for my acne to be gone. 6 months later my skin was so so clear everyone used to ask me what I’d used or how I’d done it. Fast forward to 15 I’d been on dianette 2 years and they said I had to come off it and swap to another pill so I did. The pill I went on was yasmin and I had horrific migraines and lost sight in my left eye (temporarily) which my mam ended up taking me to hospital as I was obviously freaking out. So the doctors tried me on other pills of all kinds (progesterone only and mixed) and I had the same side affects migraines which where so bad I didn’t dare try anything else. While trying all these different pills my acne had come back with a VENGEANCE and it was horrific but I was obviously more self aware now and I wouldn’t go out because of it and lost all my confidence so my mam made me go back to the doctors. The doctor I seen was my mam and dads doctor and I told her about how I felt and how my skin was affecting me and she said well if dianette is the only thing that works then we’ll just put you back on it, so I went back on it around 15 years and 4 months old and in 2 months my skin was clear again and fast forward to now I’m still on it. I’ve had no noticeable side effects like physical ones ie blood clots. But all doctors I’ve ever talked to do say that you should not be on dianette longer than a year and half at a push as it can cause really bad problems. I’ve took this pill from 13-15 then 15-19 so 6 years of my life! I am starting to worry that some of my mental health problems are being affected by this pill as I suffer from anxiety and depression which are not the worst but quite bad and it’s only gotten worse which I was put on fluoxetine then sertraline and my mg has been getting higher since. Could the pill be making this worse? Also, I’d never had problems with any type of food either in my life then all of a sudden I’m lactose intolerant and my belly bloats and cramps so hard when I eat most things. 

Wow this is such a lengthy post I am sorry but to round it together, is it normal that my doctors know I’ve been on dianette for 6 years of my life and counting and haven’t took me off it? Or can these things happen and doctors can be wrong and I’ve just found the perfect pill that works for me? 

Also if you where wondering, my periods are fine very regular, very light and not painful at all.",1,1584242360,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/fiuz1k/dianette_birth_controldepressionacneside_effects/,AskWomen,1

I have fragile skin, and I got tons of stretch marks during puberty. Not big ones sure, but I got them in several places: shoulders, behind my arms on my bac, butts, hips, front legs... basically most of my joints. No woman ever really cared before, but I don't know why, recently I've been depressed because of them. I feel like I shouldn't date pretty women because of them, like I'm a ""fake"", someone who seems to have good look but who has bad skin. 

I'm really not feeling too good because of it right now.

I tried going to meet her but couldn't and she wasn't fine enough to chat. And I myself didn't know what to say. Finally after 2 days chatting little bit with her and knowing how she is.

fijfrh,jeanetteroulette,Have you ever said mean things or bullied someone to their face or behind their back and greatly regretted it now that you're an adult?,"Sometimes I cringe thinking about the past and how I treated others that were different than I was. I greatly feel awful for it especially because I was different as well at some point and bullied for it. I just wish I was mature enough to understand these differences and that the individuals did not have to endure the ridicule of myself and others. I think I did them because of the insecurities I had at the time and possibly trying to fit in. 

For example:
There was this girl in band that had tourrettes syndrome and would have some ticks during the class that everyone would make fun of. I look back on this and feel guilty and bad for her that this happened to her. 

Another example:
When I was in fourth grade for some reason I made fun of a girl with a training bra saying to others how weird it was to even have boobs.
