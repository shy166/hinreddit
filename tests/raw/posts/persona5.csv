fsn63p,DapperDoppel,Warning if you pre-ordered P5R Phantom Thieves Edition through PlayAsia,"I put out a post earlier this morning and it seems like I wasnt the only one that got this but if you pre-ordered P5R Phantom Thieves Edition through PlayAsia, check your email. In my case, they will hold up your pre-order until you pay one of these insanely expensive shipping charges on top of what you paid for it already. Apparently this was due to a miscalculation in weight and size, and they conveniently let me know at midnight of the game's launch.  If you have this, I would advise to cancel your order and find one in stock at Best Buy, Amazon, Gamestop, etc. , most of them on eBay are even more reasonably priced then what you would pay altogether through PlayAsia. This is a shady business practice and I felt like I should warn folks if they are in this situation. If there is something missing about this whole thing by all means let me know, but Im not paying $400 total to get this at my door in the next couple of days.

fslom7,BarelyReal,[First palace spoilers]It didn't really hit me until starting the story over and paying more attention...,"&gt;!Looking back the initial charge on Joker of manslaughter in the beginning isn't true. But they could have come close. What if Kamoshida just killed himself immediately or during his apology? What if Ann didn't step in and say something? It's a point of debate really early on but is easy to gloss over. Ryuji, Joker, and Morgana know Kamoshida dying is a possibility. They express concern that they don't WANT to kill but in the end it's an acceptable risk to them. They just kind of acknowledge it and go ahead when the stakes get higher for them. They think they have no choice, sure. But the worst case scenario for them would be expulsion and Juvie for Joker, the worst case for Kamoshida would be death. Now I'm not saying they shouldn't have done what they did, but I find myself really re-evaluating the characters in the first act and how their motivation and values grow later !&lt;",2,1585689878,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fslom7/first_palace_spoilersit_didnt_really_hit_me_until/,Persona5,1

fskqid,RenzyWenzy,I need help,"So I'm in a bit of a dilemma. I loved Persona 5 and have been thinking of getting Royal. My problem is if I should get it right away or wait for a price drop.

I've poured over 200 hours into Persona 5 and finished it again late 2019. I was excited to hear about an updated Persona 5 game but felt turned off that I had to pay $60 again and basically had to start from scratch with just a reward of 50,000 yen for playing the original.

My question is if the small changes and big additions justify a full $60 price? There are quite a lot but everything I've seen and heard still come off as DLC or expansion. 

I believe this game should 100% definitely be played by someone who skipped Persona 5 but for someone like me who paid full price and put in that much time in the original, what do you guys think?

fskild,JJ_Jose,I had a thought about takemis new English voice,"So I made a post here venting my frustration with the new takemi voice, it was straight after I heard her voice so I may have been a bit unreasonable and angry when I typed that. and I've been thinking, and i take some sort of solace in the fact that this is an entirely separate game. It's what I consider an upgrade from the original game because so far just a couple hours in, I love the new changes. Meaning it's entirely possible to just think P5 R is the superior version, and just shut the door on the original. It would've been a different story all together if it was a series that have the same recurring character with the same voice that spans across multiple instalments and then just changes midway, but thankfully P5 R is it's own stand alone game. It'll be weird, but I think it's entirely possible to get used to the new voice, upsetting since the original voice is classic and we spent more time with it, but possible. I'm saying this in case other people have gotten as angry as me about the voice change, and wanted to provide some silver lining. The only damn problem I have now is that the new voice just sounds a tad too young which I feel like is a tiny mistake on the actresses part since she didn't try to make her voice sound older. The original was deeper, and gave off the sense of an older woman, and since she was a doctor, it was clear that she was much older than the main cast of characters (early to mid 20s I'd say). New one I just feel like sounds too young and that I'm talking to someone the same age as MC from shujin. But I do personally know many women that have higher pitched voices than that and are much older than 20. So if anyone is coming from my previous post about this topic and I insulted you or was rude to you in anyway, I apologise, and I'll most likely keep playing since this game has been amazing so far and I just love persona 5 so much",0,1585686220,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fskild/i_had_a_thought_about_takemis_new_english_voice/,Persona5,1

So, hypothetical, if you were to just now finish Persona 5 for the first time like me, would you leap for Royal and start from scratch, or play a NG+ to fully experience the original? 

It would be cool to unlock all Personas, get to level 99 and pursue confidants I didn't get to complete this time. But it would also be cool to have 30 additional hours of story, gameplay improvements, new characters and a whole-ass Phantom Thieves metaverse hideout. 🙃

fsimtc,wolfrunner07,Persona 5 royal first impression no spoilers,"So I know there are likely a number of people who may be still sitting on the fence about royal. This is of course only an opinion as someone who played multiple playthroughs of persona 5.

Even though it pains me to admit it I like many had concerns about royal edition but I took took the plunge. Now at  this point im not very far into the game 9 hours or so (taking my time)  not quite finished with the first dungeon.  And my opinion is royal is absolutely worth it. The best comparison I have is imagine watching the original star wars trilogy vs watching the enhanced editions if all of the changes were an improvement.  The new voice acting, new dialogue, new mechanics in dungeons leave the game feeling very fresh if not almost new. And the stuff they didn't change well it's like visiting old friends after a long time because for me as its been about 7-8 months since my last playthrough. And with the common thread ive seen with people debating whether or not to buy well to be frank from what little I've played vs the changes I've seen I don't think it would have worked as a dlc or simple expansion.

I'm was wondering if there was any advice to have a more complete run in Royal? Like optimizations?

fsgvep,Pristine_Surround,Random Dialogue Changes? (Not the scene they consider “problematic”),"I know we expected the two gay men vs Ryuji to be changed, but I noticed other changes too that feel random. For example when Sae mentions Kamoshida. In the vanilla version she says “It’s true what he did were deplorable crimes from... indulging his desire. He confessed to it all.” In Royal she says “It all came out in his confession. He was guilty of everything-the abuse, the...violations...”. And before this one, while I can’t remember the exact quotes, the when you meet the principle before all this, his lines were different too. I’m just wondering, was there any article or interview or something about why they made these little changes? I get (but don’t agree) why they would change the two gay men scene, but little random dialogue changes like these, was there any mention of it?",4,1585674812,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fsgvep/random_dialogue_changes_not_the_scene_they/,Persona5,1

fsgqgg,MightyDillah,PSA: If you're new to the game don't get 'Persona®5 Royal Legacy DLC Bundle' till you finish your first run-through of the game.,"It basically brakes the game. It gives you two persona's that are level 90+ and others that are at least 50+ which basically makes the game super easy. 

Bare in mind that 'Royal' has been tweaked a lot to be easier than before, making this game basically a walk in the park if you play on normal with the DLC persona.

Yes, the costumes are really cool but again if you haven't played the game it kinda over shadows the costumes that you get with normal progression.

To each his own I guess, but I feel like it ruins the game so be warned.

**FYI to everyone else: this is a free bundle that is available as of today to every version. It includes ALL the previous DLC from the original game.**

""huh that's weird, they took a picture and that looks like my door."" 

look around and see the amazon bag about three doors down. I'm thinking 'wow the winds must be strong to move a steelbook that far away' (couldn't afford the phantom thief edition at the moment). when I pick it up?? it's completely empty. somehow in the 15 minutes in between it being delivered and me getting it someone opened the bag, took the contents, put the bag back down, and left. 

like.....at least take the bag so I could think there was a delivery error and not know that it was stolen am I right lol? 

thankfully amazon's refunding me and I'm going to target to get ANOTHER copy

All I can do is view stats. I am only a few hours into the game if that matters. There are 4 members in my party. Is there a min forced limit you have to have in your party?

fse1pw,Taintedmage94,Complete Persona 5 original or move onto Royal,"Sorry if this is considered a ridiculous question but as of last night my copy of Royal arrived. However when I last played Persona 5, around 4 or so months ago, I only got to the end of the 5th palace and thus was wondering if it would be recommended I finish the “Canon” version of Persona 5 become moving back onto the new version.

I can see Royal does seem to be an improvement with more dynamic cut scenes and improved environments overall, based on an hour of gameplay, in addition to the new story elements. 
However, I am a bit worried about missing out on the original storyline and ending as I have heard that some of the new elements change aspects.

At current time is not an object with the current situation, I am still expected to work from home but given my job there is not a great deal that can be done from home so I could play both I guess",1,1585665566,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fse1pw/complete_persona_5_original_or_move_onto_royal/,Persona5,1

fs9krp,HeftyImage,Question(s) about P5R: Phantom Thieves Edition and Restock,"I have been attempting to buy PTE on every website for the past few days with no luck, since the times stock comes back, I'm usually busy. I literally only got 3 hours of sleep constantly reloading Amazon and Best Buy hoping I could get my hands on it, but if you couldn't tell from the title, I obviously do not yet have it. Earlier, I managed to get extremely close, but T-Mobile decided to just randomly die right before I could even place the order. It took them a good 45 minutes to resolve the nationwide issue, and by then PTE was no longer available on Best Buy. I have already checked eBay and Amazon and of course, the price has gone up by quite a bit. I don't feel like paying over $100 for it, so I'm not even gonna bother with them.  


With that useless story out of the way, I wanted to ask a question, or questions, regarding PTE and restocking. I have seen multiple people talk about this sub with some information regarding the restock. 

Is there a possibility that PTE could be restocked at retail price? My other questions are regarding Best Buy, it said on their website for a short amount of time that 1 PTE copy was left at a nearby Best Buy, but they weren't open since it's already past their open hours. Shortly after, it said it was not available and that left me confused since it's impossible for someone to have bought it at this hour. Is PTE even going to appear on store shelves or is it literally only obtainable online?

I apologize for asking too many questions, and the messy post in general, but I really need some help so I can at least know how to get PTE, since I really want to support ATLUS and not some greedy seller that's selling it at nearly twice the price, and the things included look pretty nice. You don't have to answer every question, just any little bit of help would, well, help me out a lot.

If there aren't any good solutions to this, then if someone has a little spare time, could you help me out on finding a PTE for retail price?",3,1585645198,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fs9krp/questions_about_p5r_phantom_thieves_edition_and/,Persona5,1

fs8fl8,WeeklyIntroduction42,The deal with Joker's Parents,"So throughout Persona 5, Joker's parents are barely mentioned aside from a few references. And I don't get why people say that his parents are terrible. If they truly were terrible, they would have agreed to send him to jail. Heck, they're probably paying for his schooling at Shujin which is shown to be an elite school in Tokyo.

My theory is that his parents still care about him but had to stay silent due to the corrupt law system that made it so Joker had to go on probation. As for why they never contacted him once, maybe they did but the game decides not to show it as it's not really part of the overarching story. I've also been thinking that as a part of the probation, Joker's parents were not allowed to contact their son which not only is absurd but it would also explain why we never see them.",7,1585639004,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fs8fl8/the_deal_with_jokers_parents/,Persona5,1

fs82ne,wilsonman693,my first 2 hours of P5R (SPOILERS),"so i just got the game downloaded and played it for a little and i thought id give my thoughts and opinions. again, spoilers.

from the beginning, you can tell theres much more detail added. the intro to the loading screen surpasses the original in my opinion. 

from starting the game, its almost cookie cut from p5 beginning. im pretty sure the animated cutscenes were all carried over and not redone. however, it seems the casino has been updated a little. the only difference is that theres a scene with the new character kasumi showing up. it was pretty cool. she calls joker sensei and fights beside him. from that point to the point to where i left off (the day ending of first getting arsene), nothing has really changed. even the layouts so far haven't really changed at all. the only real difference is the style, which is basically p5 vamped up. the pop ups have also changed a bit, and the camera angles have also been changed a little. a funny moment with one of the new popups is when kawakami meets joker, theres a popups that shows she almost handed her a maid flyer by accident XD. 

now with that out of the way, i think i should start off saying that im a little concerned. so far it seems less like a revamp and more like P5+. its got all the charm and more, but hasnt added all too much to show something new. there was also one of the random scenes with the police commissioner just talking to himself, which was something i thought was real even in the first. i was hoping they would fix weird things like that. it makes me concerned of what else they didnt fix up story wise. 

im still to early in to pass judgement, but i still stand by what i said. as much as i love P5, there were many flaws that needed to be addressed. i still have high hopes for the game and im sure im gonna love this even if it is basically just a replay of P5. and i really hope all of you have a splended time on it as well

I honestly would've never paid for this game at all and had bought Doom Eternal instead. Maybe if this game was a 20 to MAYBE 40 dollars dlc I would've enjoyed it more. But this game is not worth the full 60 dollar asking price. If you're just getting into persona now. Then you won't be disappointed but if you already played p5 then I honestly don't know how anyone can feel satisfied by this product.

fs6jio,TheForgottenOne454,Inception (2010) is Persona: The Movie,"I recently rewatched Inception, the film, and I realized how similar it is to Persona 5. Allow me to present the similarities below

1. The cast of characters enter someone's cognition in order to change the way they think. In both Inception and Persona a person's cognition is presented as a it's own world.


2. The person's cognition impacts the cognitive world. In inception, the protagonists enter Fischer's cognition and the world is changed by how Fischer's cognition reacts. For example, Fischer had personal defense guards always guarding him in the real world, so in the cognitive world, there are dozens of guards attacking the protagonist's throughout their journey as a figment of Fischer's cognution. This is similar to the shadows in each heart the Phantom Theives invade. 

3. Throughout the journey in Inception, the main protagonists meet and recruit a variety of characters and they grow in relationship level, like confidants in Persona. 

4. In Inception, the cast of characters change the thoughts of a person in the cognitive world in order to change how they perceive themselves and others around them in the real world. This is similar to how the Phantom Thieves take hearts and make their victims realize their evil deeds. 

5. The main protagonist in both Persona and Inception are fugitives blamed for crimes they didn't commit. Now, these are two very different situations but it is uncanny how both protagonists are fugitives that need to go on a journey to clear their names. 

These are the major similarities I saw in these two films but I believe you need to watch the film in order to truly realize how similar the game is to the film. Inception is a fantastic movie and worth a watch even if I'm spouting nonsense. However, I do believe that there are some very specific similarities between Persona 5 and Inception and I encourage you to watch the film in order to see these for yourself. Let me know what you think about these thoughts.",1,1585629652,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fs6jio/inception_2010_is_persona_the_movie/,Persona5,1

Perhaps it’s because i’m from the UK but the english voices to me sound incredibly cringey, especially among the female cast.

fs4zw4,StarmanSuper76,'Twas the Night before Royal,"'Twas the night before Royal, when all through Japan
Not a demon was stirring, not even Arsene.
 The weapons were equipped by the party with care,
In hopes that The Reaper soon would be there.
 The players were nestled, all snug in their beds,
While visions of gameplay danced in their heads. 
 And Joker in his glasses and Skull with his pack,
Had just settled in for Oracle to hack
 Into Atlus West to ship the game soon,
So that critics and gamers could play it, and swoon. 
 But what's this?! A delay?! It can't be! No way!
But alas, 'twere the case, Royal's release further a day.
 The gamers were angry - their rage, what a sight!
They complained about Amazon, on that old Reddit site.
 And Best Buy, and GameStop, and Wal-Mart to boot,
All stores were to blame for withholding their loot.
 Upset we all were, in sadness we dwelt,
Upon our PlayStations we laid down and knelt.
 Teary and woeful, we let out our rendition,
""Fuck this, dude, I'm gonna cancel and buy the digital edition.""
But recall us, everyone, that there was yet worse a hitch:

I did a bit of googling and got hit with what I would consider to be spoilers, so I'm trying to forget them, and now I ask yall. 

If this is my first time playing the game and I really don't want to google tips or use a guide at all, are there any simple things I should probably keep in mind while I play? For example, really important social links or events, or other time sensitive things I could easily miss that I will wish I didn't, or non-obvious points of no return in a dungeon with really important loot? Or is there any mechanic or gameplay element that isn't tutorialized that I should really explore first thing to get a grasp of?

Put more directly: while I've owned nearly 10 games from the overall franchise, I've yet to complete a single one.

I did purchase Persona 5, but only ever got as far as finishing the first Palace before opting out; I've literally restarted from that point three times and never proceeded any further.

I would appreciate any advice (large or small) about how to approach Persona 5 Royal from a perspective where I can finally break the curse here. 

I'm not looking to Platinum the game by any means, but I'm hoping to experience as much of the story as I possibly can knowing that I have 100+ hours in my future, which means that a follow-up playthrough might not happen quickly.

My question is, i remember certain answers awarding you 3, 2, 1 or no 'points' towards that confidants ranks. But say i played the game and only got 1 point every single time. Does that lock me out of ranking them to 10? Or is there some way of increasing ranks later on on in the game to trigger the events?

frxvac,itsfeykro,You should wait before diving into NewGame+,"Here's why.

&amp;#x200B;

The Persona games are fantastic in many regards. They're amongst the best JRPG ever, they have interesting, mature writing, an immersive universe but most of all, great characters you get to know, love, hate and get attached to.

After playing Persona 5 (or 4, or 3..) for 80, 100 maybe 150 hours, you finally completed it. And about half that time, if not more was spent purely living your life with Ryuji, Makoto and the others. During these hours, you befriended them, you got to know them, you were there when they needed to talk and they were always here to help you in the worse situations.

As I said, you get attached. Persona games are so amazing that you get emotionally and (almost) personally attached to virtual characters. I think this is the magic persona games have that a lot of other games lack, that feeling of intimacy when you interact with them.

Now, after finishing that game, you're going to feel a lot of different emotions. You're happy to have gone through that journey, proud of yourself for beating the last obstacle, but also sad that's over and melancholic when thinking about the good times that are in the past. So you may want to start another game of persona, maybe get that true ending this time and relive that amazing adventure that gave you all these memories and feelings.

So you do just that, but something is weird, different. You're new here yet you know these places as if you've always lived there. These people are all familiar yet you don't know them. And then, there's your caretaker, your friend. Cold, distant. He doesn't remember you. Your best friend? He forgot who you were, same for everyone you cared for that you felt like they were your best friends just hours ago. Then you feel that weird blues, like if someone close didn't recognize who you were.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, take the time step back and reflect on your journey. Take the time to put things back into perspective and only then, start the game over.",3,1585597930,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/frxvac/you_should_wait_before_diving_into_newgame/,Persona5,1

frwtv0,QualifyingHarbinger,"[Maybe Spoilers] With Royal around the corner, it's time to post about my favorite way to play, the broken home playthrough.","  If you've got a friend you like to play games with and want to play Persona, I've got a treat for you.

&amp;#x200B;

  The purpose of this playthrough is to act as one of Akira/Ren's guardians through a divorce. One of you gets him on Monday/Wednesday/Friday and the other gets him on Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday. Sunday is the one day Akira gets to ""Stay at a friends house"" in which both you and your friend decide on what he does with his free time together. Palaces and Mementos are up to your discretion as to who plays regardless of day of the week. Find a fair rate to take turns or not at all. Just a suggestion.

&amp;#x200B;

  The real beauty of this playthrough comes out when you and your friend have your own agendas for the playthrough. Does your friend think Ann is a good person for Akira to date? Do you think she'll be nothing but trouble and he should focus on his studies? Does it just so happen that Ann's 9th confidant falls on your day? Sabotage. Make your own ideal agenda for Akira and watch as he goes against what you say at the advice of his other guardian. The expectation is that this run will be a struggle in palaces to reflect his struggle in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

  My friend and I are both very extra when it comes to this and we argue the whole time. It's the most fun to watch the run go completely nuts. Finish the game with almost nobody at rank 10 and with limited resources available.

&amp;#x200B;

  Obviously if you guys have any questions feel free to ask. I'll be around today. Worst case just toss something in my inbox.

frwhlo,TabooAesthetics,How Persona 5 saved my life,"With Persona 5 Royal coming out in a matter of hours I thought I would share the story of how Persona 5 changed my life and why it means so much to me.

I made a throwaway account for this as I'm not proud of how I used to be, but wanted to share how this game had such a positive impact on my life.

 When I was 14 years old I was a drug addict. For around 10 months a day barely went by where I didn't consume a form of intoxicant. I smoked weed every day, combined LSD and MDMA every week and didn't think twice to swallow, snort or smoke anything that was offered to me. While I was not physically dependant on one drug, in particular, it was evident I was mentally addicted. During these months my mentality changed entirely, before then however I was a well rounded, for the most part, decent human being. I tried in school, had normal friends for a kid my age and didn't understand how someone could live a lifestyle that I ended up living. But everything changed in the matter of a short few months. I could go in-depth into how I ended up getting involved with this lifestyle, but its quite typical/not too interesting - simple as I fell into the wrong crowd and one thing led to another. During this period, I had started stealing, selling drugs and only hanging around people who had drugs/wanted to buy drugs. My life was a mess and I wasn't the person I used to be. I got into fights, at one point had a near-death experience when I went into the hospital almost having a cardiac arrest, and would come home late at night most nights to my Mum who would say things to me like ""I'm just waiting for the time a policeman turns up to tell me that you died"". I was a complete asshole, completely avoid of any care for anyone else. Fortunately, during this period, I did keep an interest in video games though, particularly JRPGs such as final fantasy (Imagine that a junkie who loves FF7 almost as much as getting high :P ) so I had heard about Persona 5 which had been released a few months back. So the last week of school came around and I asked my dad to buy me the game as a sort of well-done gift, not that I deserved it. Thankfully he said yes. There were still a few days left of school before the end of the week so safe to say I of course didn't change any habits. In particular, I would like to talk about the final day of the year. It started pretty similar to any other, I met up with a friend, we would ditch class and go get high. On this day we wanted to go full out, I guess to celebrate? We a large quantity of MDMA, high strength LSD and enough Weed to last us quite a while. Over this day, how little I remember of it I got very fucking high, people looked ""shark-like"" (please forgive my delinquent like explanation), spirals were everywhere, shit was just very trippy. At one point the friend who I was with had enough and hit a bad trip so we decided to head our separate ways. I was so blasted out of my mind the second I got home I pretty much passed out, woke up a few hours later at around 4 am and proceeded to smoke some more weed, I'm disgusted in myself more than you don't worry. BAD IDEA, or maybe good, let's call it bittersweet? This hit everything I had consumed earlier in all at once and the trip I experienced the strongest trip of my life which freaked me out for a solid 8 hours straight. I don't remember anything about this apart from it being enough for me to realise I needed to sort my life out. After this horrific experience was over I went to the door and saw Persona 5 had been delivered. I went to my room, put in the game and finished it in 2 weeks (for anyone whos finished the game you will know this is no small accomplishment) I played around 8-10 hours a day and vowed I would never take drugs again. This 2 weeks was really what I needed, being this absorbed into something that wasn't destroying my body or mind was exactly what I needed and set me on an upwards trajectory of beating JRPGs instead of getting blasted. Persona 5 saved my life as I know I was just getting worse by the day and without this experience, I may not be here. All this being said I couldn't be more edited for Persona 5 Royal and will be playing it all over again the same way (well I'm sober now and have been for quite some time, I more mean the 10 hours a day part).

frvsrq,jamesjiwen,Some questions from a new(ish) player,"Hey,

So I played P5 a few years ago, but I ended up getting distracted and dropping it after the first palace. I have fond memories though and I wanted to play again, and now Royal has given me that excuse! So I am very excited to start playing tonight! But I had some questions...

1. Do you think I should play on Hard? I like a challenge, and I guess my impression is that turn based games can be easier anyway as you have time to think about your actions? Or is normal sufficient? I'm not that hardcore, I just don't want it to be too easy.
2. I really found the systems confusing in this game. I had no idea whether I should be doing persona fusion or not, whether I should be negotiating with personas, killing them or taking their treasure. Does anyone know of a good beginners guide to introduce me to the systems, particularly in combat? I heard that bullet ammo refreshes every time now, do you think that makes a lot of vanilla P5 guides outdated then? Is it gonna change combat much?
3. Does every Persona belong to an arcana, and then that arcana is linked to someone you can develop friendships with in the real world? So if you improve their friendship with them, those personas get stronger?

I wonder what would’ve happened if the events of Persona 5 (Either the original or Royal) were to occur in the My Hero Academia universe as it did in the games where Akira/Ren is the leader. 

How would the pro-heroes like All Might, Endeavor, Mt. Lady, Gran Torino, Kamui Woods, etc. react to the Phantom Thieves?

What would be reactions of the villains upon learning about a group who somehow steal the hearts of those with a corrupted heart and make them remorseful for their crimes?

How would the students of U.A. react to the Phantom Thieves. Especially if Izuku anonymously requested Katsuki to have his heart changed?

What would the palaces of anyone who could possibly qualify be like?

Possible candidates for a palace include

* Endeavor

* Hero Killer Stain

* All for One

* Tomura Shigaraki

* The League of Villains as a whole

* Overhaul

In fact how would those possible candidates for a palace react to getting a calling card?

How would the Phantom Thieves as civilians  interact with Class 1-A?",5,1585585700,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/frtymk/what_if_persona_5_and_by_extension_all_the/,Persona5,1

1) Buy it on PSN and download it for tomorrow. Pro: I get to play it tomorrow. Con: No physical copy

2) Buy the standard edition from GAME. Pro: I get a physical copy. Con: Unlikely to get it tomorrow unlike the digital

3) Buy the steelbook from amazon. Pro: I get the steelbook. Con: I have to wait until Monday the 6th at the latest for it to arrive.

I called into my local store and they only have it the day after tomorrow, but from what I understand it's supposed to come out in about 6hours so I plan to get it digitally to play it as soon as possible, or am I getting that wrong?

Either way, the store usually has a pre-order option but now the only edition of P5R in my store says ""Chinese Ver."" and apparently was released on Feb 2nd. Having mistakenly bought a game of a different language and not being able to get a refund as well I'm especially wary.

I bought P5 Last year and I got into it around Fall. I honestly love this game. 




My question is that I havent beaten the game yet, but im super interested in royal. 

Im on the Casino Palace and a friend of mine told me i only have 1-2 palaces left. Ive sat the game down for like a good week because this palace seems like a headache and I often take breaks, I got 120 hours into the game even though im sure atleast 40 hours of that is probably idle time on my ps4 just being on. 

Should I just finish P5 than get royal after(could easily take me another month to beat the game at this rate). I usually play the game for 15 hours across 2 days than ill stop for a bit. And i honestly slowed down a lot because i felt the game was coming closer to an end and i wanted it to last longer.

The very few games I have replayed left me with tainted experiences, I was worried that going back to persona with royal I might get bored since I knew the story. But boy I was wrong and it is so good to be back at shujin with my favourite peeps. 

Whilst the first few hours dragged slightly with all the tutorial stuff. Once it gets going it's so awesome being back. Not only have I forgot alot since 2015 but I'm noticing small new details that enrich the experience. Since the game came out I also visited Tokyo / Shibuya and its amazing just how to scale they made it and all the little details I now notice like the subway signs. I got lost looking for the ginza line in the game just like I did in Tokyo lol. 

Anyway. I'm about 10 hours in and I've probably only experienced about 20mins of new stuff but honestly it's been worth every penny and anyone on the fence I recommend royal.

If Joker and Morgana noticed that Akechi heard the latter speak back during the TV station visit, how come they never use that as basis to suspect him as the black mask throughout the game before the festival ? They would at least know that this means he has accessed the Metaverse beforehand. At the very least they wouldn’t just dismiss it completely until after he lies about hearing Morgana speak for the first time.

frhtbb,sleepyghostboy,Just wanted to share that I delayed getting P5R myself,"So I was on the fence of buying a physical copy vs digital, but I did want that steelbook case. I ordered through amazon a week ago, and it said it'd be delivered tuesday and I was keeping an eye out if it'd be delayed because of Covid19.

Today this morning I woke up to a message saying it finally shipped but said it'd arrive wednesday, and I wanted it at release so I thought ""well I'll just cancel and buy it digitally"" 

So I hit cancel, then it suddenly hit me that I'll have to wait 3-5 business days to get my money back (can't order another one since I bought Animal Crossing too and food) and I couldn't cancel the cancelation lol so now if I want a physical copy, i'd have to wait next week, and if I wanted a digital copy i'd still have to wait probably till friday to get my money back (i'll lose out on dynamic theme too), and as a college student, i'm going back to class next week too so I won't have more time to dedicate to P5R.

All in all, I messed up, and now I'm going to sit here in my room waiting even longer because I made a dummy mistake.",4,1585532348,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/frhtbb/just_wanted_to_share_that_i_delayed_getting_p5r/,Persona5,1

But I can't bring myself to like Joker? It's not even about the fact that he's a silent protagonist, if anything he feels more like a background character. While there are dialog options, they're really vague or don't offer enough input to really develop his character.

So I dunno. I might get a lot of backlash, but all the hype around him doesn't make since. I don't want to compare his character to other silent protagonists either, cause that wouldn't be fair.

frhgf3,capybard,Will I like Persona 5 if I disliked the life-sim elements of Fire Emblem: Three Houses?,"I'm looking for a game to play during the quarantine, and I thought it might as well be a game that I wouldn't usually have the time to play. Persona 5 seemed like a good candidate. I love how the game looks and sounds, and I do like some turn-based JRPGs (Final Fantasy X probably has my favorite JRPG battle system) so I figure I'll probably enjoy the combat. I'm not really into anime aside from Studio Ghibli stuff, but from what I've heard of game critics I trust, that aspect of Persona 5 shouldn't bother me.

However, I've recently tried many game with life sim aspects  that I bounced off of pretty hard, particularly Three Houses.  I really like most of the Fire Emblem games but the constant interruptions in Three Houses to have tea, eat lunch and do other mundane activities with the characters really killed the momentum for me and I ended up quitting the game.

I also played a lot of Yakuza 0, which I really liked at first but I eventually got bored of all the activities. Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley (which I realize might be straying to far from Persona 5 to be useful points of comparison)  also did nothing for me.

Basically, do you folks think I might enjoy Persona 5 anyway, or will the whole high school simulation thing probably not work for me? Just worried that I might like one half of the game and hate the other.

frc1vq,vascopatricio,Feeling bittersweet about the new trophies,"So, the new trophies are very easy (a 2/10 in one of the Platinum roadmaps available on the web). This feels like it will make the game too easy.

I still remember the hellish effort I had to put in to get Passionate Listener, noting down lines in a mega excel sheet and inflicting status ailments and dozens of other stuff. And despite making a playthrough just to max all the confidants, I almost missed it due to one missed meeting with Haru. The thrill of getting all of this done (all confidants + passionate listener + all memento missions + all other cleanup) was an amazing experience. Hellish, but I gave me an amazing sense of accomplishment.

I'm worried, despite the quality of the new P5R, that I'm not going to get that same sense of achievement. We're not required to max out all confidants, finish all memento missions, passionate listener's gone... sure, there is a trophy for maxing all social stats and the reaper, plus the true ending, but I think it will feel more like a ""drive by"" experience. Do one playthrough and clean up a bit and you're done.

Maybe it's just me, but I expected that with the refined version of the game, everything would be more grandiose. The gaming, the experience... and the challenge as well. The challenge actually seems half of the original... Sure, you can max all confidants and do several playthroughs if you personally want to, but there will be no ""formal recognition"" of those achievements. Which is what the trophies are for, right?

Am I the only that thinks the decreased difficulty in the trophies will actually make this perfect  game actually a bit more anticlimactic? Would love to hear opinions...",21,1585511582,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/frc1vq/feeling_bittersweet_about_the_new_trophies/,Persona5,0

frbwhm,Baumgratz,My love letter to Persona 5,"I want to tell you guys my journey with this game and how it stole my heart (*pun intended*), i'm writing this with no planning at all so can be a little messy and I will probably forget something, but i really mean everything.

I remember back in 2017 when my friend was talking with me about Persona 5 and how great it was, but I never payed much attention on it. She kept talking about it from time to time and how great the characters were (specially the females) but yeah, It didn’t caught my attention. Another friend was always playing the OTS on his car and caught my ears, I even started listening before playing the game.  But what truly caught my attention was when I discovered the similarities between Persona and JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. As a huge JoJo fan I needed to search more about it.

It was just on last Christmas when I travelled to NYC, and stopped in a GameStop I saw a copy on sale for just $9, I soon remembered my friend talking about it and thought “why not, it’s cheap, and looks pretty good”. But I never thought it would be THAT GOOD. (Keep in mind I didn’t even knew about Royal at this point).

So, I started playing on early January and was rushing into it, I was loving each second of it, but as soon as my college started I didn’t had enough time to play, I was almost a whole month without turning on my PS4, it was just due the Lockdown that I started playing again (thanks Covid-19) and now I finally finished it.

I spend more than 100 hours playing it and collected a lot of great moments and some regrets, like not paying much attention to some confidants and couldn’t max out all of them, some I didn’t made more than rank 2/3. But those who I made far away to rank 10 compensated. The best thing about this game is by far the characters, their stories and how you Interact with them. And now, since I introduced the characters topic, I need to talk about the most important choice in the game. **Romance.**

I started the gameplay really interested on Takemi, she’s just the representation of all my real life preferences and I felt no other character would chalange her on my best girl list. But then, Makoto was introduced, at the beginning she was really annoying, but when she really joins your group things changed drastically. I think everyone here knows how the anime/game community are with waifus, it usually involves an emotional bond with the character, but people change their “waifus” really fast or don’t care too much. For me it wasn’t a thing that I really cared about, but back in 2018 when I played Doki Doki Literature Club I got really attached with Monika and she was my top tier (and probably only) waifu… Unitil now, Makoto became special for me, and now my waifu spot is between the both characters. I don’t really know why but I just loved her character. The conflict she goes through the game trying to rebel and become someone by herself is inspiring.

Talking about the other charactrs, I could really say a lot about of them but this would become way bigger than alredy is. So I’m going to describe the most important ones with 1 short sentence.

**Futaba** – Amazing girl that I want to protect.

**Ann** – Good friend, but I can’t relate too much.

**Ryuji** – Best boy, no wonder why he so loved.

**Yusuke** – Maybe the most underrated character.

**Haru** – If she were introduced earlier would be better, she’s cute tho.

**Morgana** – I want to adopt a cat with his name now.

**Sojiro** – I want to be like him when I grow up, what a kind hearted man.

**Kamoshida** – Horrible person, the villan I most hated.

**Madarame** – Don’t really cared much about him, but introduced Yusuke so it’s ok.

**Kaneshiro** – How dare you do what you did to my Makoto?

**Okumura** – Just as evil as any big CEO, probably the most real of the villans.

**Sae** – Best palace, nice character, caugh me off guard when she joined our side.

**Shido** – There’s to much reasons for hating him, but the biggest is his goddam palace.

**Akechi** – Good character, but a big asshole, had no remorse with wha happened to him.

About the end of the game, I thought the plot envolving mementos and the holy grail a bit too much, the level of power skyrocketed and let me annoyed, but the game conclusion was so touching that I let it go. The end scene is truly bittersweet and made me fell empty when ended, this means the game accomplished his goal, made me truly involved with everything on it. Finishing it was like losing a part of myself, definitely it’s on my top 3 favorite games of all. There’s also the whole thing about the meaning of the cognition world and how it’s a metaphor for some psychology studies that I could make a whole thread about, but I need to search a little more about it to do, but those kind of things always get me, I really like those psychological stuff. I just want to experience everything again as it was the first time.

**TL;DR:** *Never knew the game was this good. Fun, great characters, Makoto best girl, crazy end, felt lonely when finished.*",5,1585511051,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/frbwhm/my_love_letter_to_persona_5/,Persona5,5

fr7zya,MajesticJazz,"Never been into anime, will I enjoy P5R?","April was supposed to be the month of Cyberpunk 2077 which is my style of RPGs....the western style with open worlds, dynamic gameplay, dialog options, romance options and a story that plays out depending on your choices.

Unfortunately CP2077 is now delayed til September and there isn't any RPGs that I havent played that will hold me over for a long while.

I keep hearing a lot of good things about P5 and it is only safe to say P5R will be even better. I hear there is something of an ""open world"" to explore and something about romances and a story that I guess plays out based on your decisions while not as in depth as a game like The Outer Worlds. However, I've never been one to really like anime, never have. Not to say I dont like it, just that it never appealed to me. The only ones that drew in my attention were the more adult/darker theme ones.

Either way, I'm thinking about picking it up next week. I hear it is a long game which I like and the story/characters are great as well....which is also what I like especially if the characters are on the same level as Mass Effect and Dragon Age.

I have no understanding of past Persona games and I'm not really an anime fan. However, all that aside, will I still have a good time with P5R?

Also, I dont mind turn based combat. After playing Doom Eternal, it would be a nice change of pace for something more tactical and less twitchy.",35,1585497297,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fr7zya/never_been_into_anime_will_i_enjoy_p5r/,Persona5,1

Well in the true ending, didn’t the masses end up putting their trust in the phantom thieves to take care of the situation? as in the masses chose somebody else to do everything for them. It always bugged me a bit how the trust put in Yaldabaoth is seen as a bad thing while the masses changing their minds about the Phantom Thieves almost immediately even though they were (according to the public) the people who killed Kunikazu Okumura, seen as a rightful thing.

I've played a number of SMT games previously (but never Persona, unless Tokyo Mirage Sessions counts), and have always played the original before the re-release. For Devil Survivor vs. Overclocked, there isn't too much of a difference that would warrant me double-dipping, but for SMT4 vs SMT4A, Apocalypse it was a completely different story that called back frequently to the original SMT4 which made me glad to have played it prior. 

I think P5R is looking to be more Overclocked than SMT4A which is why I've hesitated buying the original yet, but do you think there's any merit in playing the original before I start playing P5R?",7,1585478492,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fr406y/should_i_play_the_original_p5_before_p5r/,Persona5,1

fr0xug,kkundlas1105,Are the original endings in Royal?,"I haven't kept up with everything related to Royal, but I do know that unlike Golden which just got an optional epilogue and a bad ending added, a new main story ending and bad ending were added on that are significantly different from the original one (and apparently incompatible with the other P5 spinoffs) to a point I'm personally not happy with.

That being said, are the original endings in the game? I assume the new endings are locked behind the new social links, so if I choose to skip them, can I get the original game's story (barring Kasumi's unskiplable intros)?

I mainly ask this because considering how the game's opening is changed, I dont know how optional Kasumi and by extension the new content is.

fqzn3k,OmegaFlame7,Question about Shido’s palace in Royal,"IMO, the single worst part about Persona 5 is the rat maze in Shido’s palace. The reason for this is because it is split into two loading zones that you have to constantly go between, and each time you enter these zones, every enemy respawns. Since the hallways are so narrow, you can’t just run past them, forcing you to have to constantly fight the same enemies over and over again. Is this fixed in Royal? Since they’re no longer inhibited by the PS3, are these mazes now all in one zone or at least changed in a way that won’t make me want to perform an irl Persona 3 awakening?",1,1585455297,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fqzn3k/question_about_shidos_palace_in_royal/,Persona5,1

fqwltf,Vesperian_Bladewing3,If Smash Ultimate had another Persona 5 character who would it be?,"So if you aren't a Smash Ultimate player let me inform you that there was a character fighter pass that brought in 5 new characters (techinally 6 but it was more of a limited time to get him for free) Joker (P5), Hero (Dragon Quest Series), Banjo and Kazooie (Banjo and Kazooie Series), Terry (Fatal Fury and another game I forgot the name of), and Byleth (Fire Emblem Three Houses). Since they represented Joker in the first pack of new characters, in the second pack IF they tried adding another P5 character who would it be?

FROM THIS POINT BEYOND ITS SPOILERS FOR PERSONA 5 ROYAL PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION

So I was thinking of two candidates that would be perfect for this spot of new characters. First is Akechi, since Royal makes him more of a main character than a traitor this would make sense. Especially how he is suppose to be the opposite of Joker this spot would make the best sense to me. How his Persona mechanic in Smash would be different than Joker's. Usually Joker has to be hit and then Arsene would be summoned to strengthen and give new effects to Joker's attacks. So I thought that rather do that do Akechi's two mask that he shows, his red and white mask and his all black mask. His first form would be his red and white and most of his attacks are strong but slow (opposite of Joker) and when his bar is filled turned into black mask and his attacks also get more effects and he gets faster, but instead of getting stronger his attacks would get weaker. Seems dumb right but why not extend the range of his attacks, this does sound stupidly OP but we would have to see how this would work for everyone.

And the second character that could take a second Persona 5 representative is Kasumi. Please correct me if I'm right but seeing from clips of Kasumi in action it seems like Kasumi is an on and off again team member till last Palace. But she is like the cover character of Persona 5 Royal which is why I would mostly put her over the other characters. The fact her whole battling style revolves around dancing could be her movement and attacks in Smash. But her Persona mechanic is what makes me confused how it would work. Just basic like Joker's or another method? I thought of one but it might be a little too extreme. So have a menu like Hero for her and she is able to use physical moves from Persona 5 but at the cost of her health. Highest being 20%. Or it can work like Terry's after a certain percentage you can use a physical move and the more higher your percentage goes, it could change to different moves, the more stronger it becomes.

Also as final smashes it could be their All-Out-Attack, but if they are on the same time with Joker it would be a Showtime Attack, but it would have to be either Akechi or Kasumi not Joker activating the Showtime Attack. 

So who would be a good candidate? Who else should represent Persona 5 Royal?",15,1585443296,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fqwltf/if_smash_ultimate_had_another_persona_5_character/,Persona5,1

Ok so basically I was just watching a persona 5 royal trailer, and im looking in the comments. People are just making dumb jokes like SPOILER: Joker is in the game. I don't think anything bad will happen, so I look at the replies to the comment. The first comment reply that shows up says everything it could that spoils royal. No spoiler warning. I was spoiled about Kasumi's death, and how akechi and kasumi disappear. I don't really get what the second one means yet, but the fact that someone spoils something as major as a death pisses me off. I also got spoiled about takuto being a villain, and how he brings back mementos.",8,1585437057,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fquv3b/i_just_got_spoiled_about_a_lot_of_p5r_spoilers/,Persona5,0

&amp;#x200B;

I have pre-purchased this game and just had a few questions.   I haven't played a lot of JRPG's, but, I just like the style of this game.    Just different than most RPGs I usually play.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering about the DLC that is avail?   Can they be used with this one?  Or just P5?   Also, is their a good website that can point me in the right direction when I start to play?   This seems like the kind of game that one doesn't keep going back.

It's the bit where they take Futaba to the beach and he says ""we're missing one?"" while the girls are coming out after changing into their swimming costumes. HOW HAVEN'T I NOTICED THIS BEFORE?! Or was it someone else and I'm going mental...? I just wondered as I thought he was a silent protagonist (excluding his little soundbites to the player).

   My only complaint is there is just too much dialogue.  A very strange difference from almost every other video game that lacks the proper amount and well written dialogue. It has amazing writing there is just way too much. It seems like they have to have banter, much of it close to conversations they have already had one or more times before, at every scene switch.

I now have nothing to look forward to and have nothing to occupy myself with. Even homework doesn't take that long. And look, I know this is a first-world problem but, it sucks. I pre-ordered the game over a month ago and now I can't get it and I probably won't have the time to get it when the country comes out of lockdown. I'm very, very peeved by this. I binged P5 videos because my friends told me to and now that I'm finished I have nothing left to do because I was worried I wouldn't finish it in time for the 31st of March, but oh how wrong I was.

How DOES it work in the meta verse? “A gunpowder set that allows you to restock the party’s ammo.” But how?

HOWEVER, before in the buffet, when the protagonist and Morgana get their own food. They eavesdrop on several people. Two of which were the ""TV Station President"" and ""IT President"" later of which, we fight in Shido's palace.



Bonus Fun Trivia: I decided to play my first NG+ with the Japanese audio than the English dub. I noticed that Caroline would always say ""Shujin"" in the velvet room when addressing the protagonist, because in Japanese, Shujin means prisoner/inmate. So the school you attend in game, ""Shujin Academy"" is literally ""Prisoner Academy""

fq40lg,Leandronb,Is it possible to beat first palace in one day?,"Hi guys. I recently started playing persona 5, my first persona game. It was really boring the first 3 hours, almost gave up, now I’m hooked. I am at Kamoshida palace in 04/18. Beat the first boss in the church and screwed up and got ambushed by an enemy after the fight, 6 horses killed me. So I loaded, beat the boss again and ambushed the nearest enemy. Went back and saved the game. I read that you can leave the palace to buy stuff. I’m out of SP so it would be nice. The game talks a lot about a deadline and how the time is limited so I never waste time anywhere just followed the main path 100% and got to where I am now. I was wondering if is ok to leave the palace to buy stuff or I should try to complete in one go. Is it even possible? 

Also I didn’t buy anything because things were expensive and I didn’t know if I would need the money later. 

Is kinda hard to understand how time works in this game. I thought I had to rush but since I started the palace the time is the same.

I was think about using an emulator so if I should play P3 and P4 does anybody know an (simple if possible) emulator I can use? (if my laptop can even handle the game because I’m a console player so I don’t know too much about this stuff. Also if I get to playing P5 should I play the regular one or Royal? I heard Royal has more stuff to do but I also heard some story lines were changed. Also one last thing I could watch the anime of P3 and P4. I watched part of the P4 anime and quite liked it. (Never finished cuz my laptop broke for a while and never got back to it.) So yeah... any one of these questions would be nice to have answered.

You could say the game stole my heart. Been backtracking and playing P3 during this quarantine/lockdown period and I love how different it is from P5.

Now onto my question, I fell in love with this series after playing through P5. Do you think it's worth it for me to get Royal at release when the story is still very fresh for me or should I wait it out for a bit? I'm choosing between this and buying games for my Switch.

fpyj7z,RaiNyyyJian,Review on P5S (No Spoiler),"

So I‘’ve FINALLY finished the game. And well I do have some things to say. ( I am not very sure about th e names of the characters/items/peronas as I only played Chinese and Japanese versions of P5 and P5S)

Probably everyone knows by now that P5S is by no means a traditional ""Dynasty"" game. No, it's really not. In my opinion it's not even an action RPG, as what KOEI and Atlas have been telling us.  For me, it's a straight RPG. 

Frankly I've never played any action RPG or Dynasty-like games before but I do enjoy hard core action games like Dark Souls and Sekiro. I thought P5S would have been a pretty easy and relaxing game for me, trained by the infamous FromSoftware. That's not the case. 

There were 3 difficulties available in the first playthrough: Easy, Medium and Hard. I played with Hard for most of the time. The first 30-40% of the game was really suprisingly challenging. Almost all the bosses were very tough, had immense HP ( especially the lockkeepers, who you will have to defeat before challenging the real boss of the chapter) and their attacks were relentless and very heavy. What further added to the difficulty was how ridiculously bad the teamates could be. My SP was never enough -- without uprading, I could hardly use 5 skills with the entire slot. By and large I had a lot of challenges and fun in the first half of the game.

But once you are familiar with the system and how everything works, you will soon discover what this game is really about: buy a hell bunch of SP potions and continuously using skills that target the enemies' weakness. Trust me. This is not fun. Everything became so robotic and repetitive when I started potion-skill-potion my enemies. What's worse, I think that is exactly what Atlas and Koei want the players to do. The reason why I am saying this is that autoattacks deal around 15-20 damages in the late game but a skill that aims at the weakness can easily deal 150 or above. And that is not counting the fact the attacking weaknesses with skills can destroy the shields of the bosses and deal further damages. I don't know about medium and easy, but by only autoattacking the bosses you will take much much much much much longer time to win every battle. But even with SP potions and endless skill bombardments every boss battle is too long. Way too long, especially what I have to do is mostly repetitive. Also, the attacks of the bosses can be avoided really easily everytime. Like literally everytime. You do not even need to mind the direction from which the attack is coming from. Just pull the R2 trigger and the attack will miss 99% of the time no matter how dangerous it seems.

I am not saying that the game is not good or very boring.  I had a lot of fun in the first half of it and I didn't feel very disappointed in the second half. In my opinion the biggest problem with it is that the game is too long. It could have stopped at 35-40 hours when people will not start to have felt bored but it went on and really bored me with some more jails (palace in P5S) which are exactly the same as the previous ones except for the backgrounds, maps and shadows. 

I know that the English version won't be released until June (My guess is that the date will postpone due to the virus). So if you have any questions that you want to ask please do comment here and I'll be very happy to answer them. Maybe I will talk about how I think of the story and some other things about the game later too.",0,1585321795,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fpyj7z/review_on_p5s_no_spoiler/,Persona5,1

fpucge,corianderflower,On P5R as standalone vs as DLC,"I understand that it's basically a remake with new characters and new everything, but a small part of me still is hoping that I can just buy it as a dlc because I already have the base game— even though it's probably impossible because they're changing so many elements that it's already a new game in itself. But I think they could still release certain elements as dlc though. But from a business standpoint, it makes sense for Atlus to have P5R as a standalone game to attract non-Persona fans to get into the series... and well from the money standpoint as well. They'll obviously earn more from selling a standalone game vs dlc.  Plus, when it comes to previous decisions the company has made (like remaking P3 into P3 FES, making a PSP exclusive which was P3P and also remaking P4 into Persona 4 Golden), it makes sense that this (doing remakes) is what they're comfortable with and what they're likely to do in their future games (P5 to P5R for instance).

But personally, I feel like if you're very against getting P5R, you're probably just not willing to pay that amount just to play the game again (even with more content). Which is how I feel because I'm enrolling into uni in just two more weeks so I doubt I'll have the time to sit down and truly enjoy P5R, you know? I'll probably just get it in a few more months when the hype dies down and the prices drop.

Creating schedules, following blocks of time, etc., seemed fairly difficult. Procrastination, etc., has always been a problem.

But, for some reason, maybe placebo or not, it feels like playing a bit of Persona 5 has gotten me to think more systematically about my time. What do I want to do? What are the projects I want to complete? What do I need to do to get there. It's nothing exciting like leveling up Confidants and trying to beat the Palace before a major deadline, but it feels like it's helping me to start thinking a bit more systematically.

fpo6ki,Sloth-Senpai,Best Buy in store pick up,"Hey all,

Posting this because I want to see if anyone else is in a similar situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I preordered the Phantom Thieves edition from Best Buy back when it was announced and chose in store pickup since I live really close to a best buy. Due to the coronavirus, instore pickup was changed to curbside pickup. But now, I just got an email that my local best buy will be closed indefinitely and that I won't be able to pick up. 

In that email, they suggest changing the order to pickup from another store or to have it shipped. However, since the game is releasing in &lt;5 days, the website won't let me make changes to my order and is simply grayed out. 

I called Best Buy CS and they simply told me that they themselves can't make changes to the order until it releases on Tuesday and I would have to wait until to call back and then to request to make the change to shipping.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else dealing with this right now? Did you call BB and hear a similar response?

There's a curious difference between between Vanilla and Royal for merciless difficulty for both XP and items:

**Vanilla:** x0.4

**Royal:** x1.2

Are these values correct? Does Royal actually give more experience/items on merciless. Assuming this is correct this may make Merciless slightly easier than Hard difficulty in spite of the lower damage dealt.

I loved how the game encouraged relaxing and just enjoying it.  I have a bad personal habit of trying to min max everything in other games but personas new game plus let me know that even if I didn’t max out every confidant or get my knowledge to the highest level, it’s okay because I can just spin that masterpiece right back up and go after what I missed.  Yes it’s a long story after 100 some odd hours but damned if the game doesn’t let you play at your own pace.  Sure you can find a guide that tells you everything to say or do on a specefic day and if that’s how you want to enjoy this great game hey more power to ya!!!

fpiptw,Henchman05,Is Persona 5 Royal a game for me?,"Hi guys,
I have been gaming for over twenty years and have never really been a big fan of the jrpg. There are a few exceptions that captured my heart, them being the early Pokémon games, Final Fantasy IX and Dragon Quest 11.

However the Internet is so hyped over Persona 5 Royale that I figured it might be a great place for me to start the series. However would it be something I might like?

Things I love about jrpgs:
A good story with interesting characters
Things to do I between the fighting
A real sense of progression

Things I hate about jrpgs:
Combat moves slowly
All the enemies look the same and you have to fight them all hundreds of times.
Random combat initiations from invisible enemies.

All answers are welcome, thanks in advance for replaying.",14,1585253595,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fpiptw/is_persona_5_royal_a_game_for_me/,Persona5,3

***Full disclosure, I am going to take a crack at making a Persona-Like story to go along with this fan-made palace theme for Joker.***

Just got this game a couple months back and just started playing it. Really like it so far. I had a question about Time though. I am going for the platinum, and I know if I don’t fully max my stats and confidants it’s not a huge deal because you need a new game plus play through anyway, but how strict are they with time? I’ve wasted minimal time, but I had one night where I didn’t finish a crossword puzzle thinking they would let me do something else but they didn’t, and I had to leave the first palace and re-enter. I know about some other tricks to save time, like get the trophy for fishing and then load a save and do 5-6 mementos at once, but did those two instances of wasted time make it impossible to max confidants and skills, or do they give you a little bit of leeway?",0,1585234198,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fpcrml/question_about_time/,Persona5,1

I was skeptical when I first picked up the game. I've never really played a JRPG before, and wasn't sure the genre was really my thing. However, within the first 4 hours, I was hooked. The story was deeply fascinating, the music was a bop, and the combat system was simple, yet complex enough to keep me very invested in it.

The characters stand out the most though. Every single character, from Ryuji to even Shido, are so full of life. Every character feels REAL, and have distinct personalities that you can really connect with. I can't help but love all the characters, even characters like Kamoshida.

Makoto:Worst girl for me. Not because I hate her, but her social link just wasn't as interesting as the others I've done. (Sorry)

Futaba:Also another I didn't date. She was too much like a little sister to date, but I loved her and her character. The whole lazy otaku gamer persona she has reminds me of Chiaki from Danganronpa.

Haru:My number 1 waifu. Her cute and sadistic personality made me love her so much. I denied the love route out of pure curiousity it broke my heart because of how much she liked us and we denied her feelings. I also would love to see her part time in Leblanc because seeing her and Ren work together would be amazing.

I don't really mind too much since the English dub is pretty good, but I played the original in Japanese and PQ2 obviously was JPN only, so the JPN voices are more familiar to me.

I've been farming the path of Chemdah for more than 3 hours now going up and down each floor in order and fully exploring them every time without seeing the slightest jewel on the road so here are my questions :
- Is finishing the second palace not enough of a requirement to make them pop in Mementos?
- How does their appearance work? Does the game pick a floor (e.g. Chemdah 6th floor) and decides every time you enter it if it appears or not?

1. I decided to throw Atlus some extra money by preordering the digital Ultimate Edition. I am a Persona noob and have never played any of the games though. Are the DLC Persona worth keeping around? Or can I fuse them and lose them? I'll be happy with all the extra costumes and whatnot but I'm still curious about the usefulness of the extra Personas. 

2. Are there any tips or useful guidances for a first time player? I don't want to look for guides or wander into spoiler territory. I don't normally tread into JRPG territory also but I've read of going into P5 blind and learning the ropes yourself being the essential way of playing. Any thoughts? 

Stay safe and stay sane!

TL/DR: I've never played Persona. Are the DLC Personas worth keeping? Is there anything I should know or should I go in blind? Thanks!",4,1585141751,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fopzp2/take_your_tips/,Persona5,1

fojg76,HemlocSoc,How Persona 5 saved me (and probably my brother),"So, this post is more of a thank you to anyone on this subreddit that has worked on Persona 5 in any capacity, as well as those of you that try to spread the word about this awesome game. I'm an 18-year-old college senior, living with my parents and my 13-year-old brother while I finish up my Bachelor's, and I'm pretty used to cooking for my brother and cleaning up the house a little, sort of as a thank you to my parents, for letting me live with them and paying for my groceries. I also like listening to the P5 soundtrack on my noise-canceling headphones while I clean, so that way it's not so mundane and I can have a bit of fun while I do it. After I finished up sweeping the kitchen, I took my headphones off and heard some crying. I peeked in the other room and saw my brother, standing behind my stepdad, with his eyes watery. I asked what happened, and my stepdad turned around and started yelling about how we spent all day in the house (even though we had to since our classes are online) and we didn't even bother to make our beds. I assumed he just had a bad day at work and came home frustrated, but his face was all red from screaming, and apparently, he was so mad he made my brother cry. Seeing that my stepdad was yelling at me now, my brother tried to sneak upstairs to cry in his room, since he's a shy crier, like me. My stepdad noticed and told him to get back downstairs. My brother's eyes were pretty puffy and watery, plus he was running down the stairs, so he tripped and fell down the last couple of steps. I wanted to go help him up, but my really tall stepdad was standing between us and screaming in my face. I looked back at my brother, and he was grabbing his chest and his neck like he was struggling to breathe. I would later learn that the fact that he was already crying coupled with the fall induced an asthma attack. I told my stepdad that it looked like he couldn't breathe and he just said ""So? I'm forty years older than him and I feel like I can't breathe sometimes!"". At that point, I froze. I wanted to go help, but I couldn't even move my fingers. My stepdad wasn't going to do anything. He was busy yelling at me about how I was supposed to pick up the dog poop yesterday from the backyard, but I did it today. My brother could not breathe. Then, I remembered when Joker got his persona in Kamoshida's castle. He didn't know that he would summon a powerful force to help him fight Kamoshida and save Ryuji. For all Joker knew, he was just going to get killed first. But he spoke up anyway. At that moment, I said something like ""get out of my way"" and I pushed my stepdad with force I didn't know I had, and I went to help my brother reach for his inhaler and help him catch his breath. Seeing that made my stepdad snap out of his rage, and he grabbed the phone to call an ambulance. Luckily, my brother was fine thanks to his inhaler, but if I had just stayed frozen there, he wouldn't have been able to reach for it. I have nothing but Persona 5 to thank for giving me the strength to act. If you've worked on this game in any capacity or if you've ever gotten someone else to play it, thank you. You have no idea how many lives have been changed by this one game. Thank you, from the bottom of my stolen heart.",9,1585107409,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fojg76/how_persona_5_saved_me_and_probably_my_brother/,Persona5,1

The games I've seen this for is Last of Us Part 2 (upgrade from Standard for 9.99) and Death Stranding (upgrade from Standard for 19.99).

For anyone who pre-ordered the Standard or Special Editions of P5R, does Atlus utilize this feature? Do you get to pay the difference for the higher editions or are they listed at full price?

foic3e,Clarkey7163,Why stores are releasing copies early in Australia,"Howdy, so there's been a recent development in Australia, Royal is now out if you pre-ordered a physical edition.

I just wanted to offer some reasoning as to why. Basically unlike the US and a lot of Europe at the moment, Australian retailers is still open for the most part.

What's happening is this; Australian stores received their copies of Persona 5 Royal late last week. They were meant to remain there til the 31st, but its looking very likely that due to the virus, stores will be shuttered by the 31st

So what's happening today? I don't know if its with the blessing of Atlus/Sega (I hope it is) but EB Games, HB Hi Fi (another big Aussie games retailer) are releasing early in order to fulfil orders and sell the game while they can

What I'm hoping is that Atlus/Sega also conclude that physical sales around the world are going to suffer greatly from department stores closing [Gamestop just closed in the US](https://www.thedealexperts.com/news/gaming-news/gamestop-is-closing-retail-storefronts-and-going-digital/), and so they just release the game early now on both physical and digital platforms. 

Considering Atlus was so anal about spoilers with P5, here's hoping they keep that same level of commitment and release it early on the digital side (as someone with a digital pre-order, AtlusPLZ)",13,1585102673,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/foic3e/why_stores_are_releasing_copies_early_in_australia/,Persona5,1

Im on the second palace, and it's now been three times in a row where I make about 20 minutes of progress, then joker just gets one shot from some random guy and I lose almost a half hour of progress without ever finding a trace of the next safe room. It wouldn't be too bad if the game didn't forget everything when you die. Gotta rewatch all the dialogue sequences and redo puzzles in order that you've already solved, it remembers nothing, and I find that so annoying.

I know I'm just angry and typing my anger away, and the safe room system is actually not that bad, but my fucking god I've been playing this game since I got home like 2 hours ago and have made zero progress, even though I did make plenty of progress.

My opinion on this game has dropped ridiculously and Im basically playing it out of a sense of hate-fueled personal torture just because I loved the other sections in the game. Okumura's palace is a ridiculous leap of difficulty with too many bosses, no safe rooms between those bosses, SP draining way too quickly because physical attacks are rarely useful, and I just keep dying in the barrack section over and over even though pulled up a walkthrough. I already lowered the difficulty from normal to easy and its still just awful. I just nearly beat the final battle before the next safe room and suddenly died because I ran out of Sp and healing items and was hitting a minion with worthless physical attacks.

So I’ve been a fan of Persona 5 since the first real trailer in 2015. I knew going in I’d love it, and wanted the Take Your Heart edition, but everywhere i went was sold out. When they announced Royal, I promised myself i wouldn’t let it happen again. Unfortunately, when pre orders went live, i was between jobs and didn’t have the financial ability to make it happen. Every retailer i visited to pre order said that i should just be there at the door on the 31st for a chance. That was the plan, but with my state calling for a shutdown on nonessential businesses, I’m not able to do it anymore. My local walmart and target is still open, and i was thinking of just being there as soon as theyre open, but I’m not sure if they’ll even have it/if theres a better method

TL:DR is there any way i can get a Phantom Thieves edition at this point without buying from a scalper?",3,1585010965,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fnvq1a/any_chance_i_can_still_get_a_pt_edition/,Persona5,1

I usually fall asleep around 2am and wake up at around 10am. Now I’m falling asleep at like 8 am waking up around 6pm but whatever i think the schedule difference is giving me wild dreams. 

Last night I was at one of my favorite artists concert(in dreamworld) jamiroquia. Toward the end of the show I ear DUN DUN DuN. The title theme to P5 begins to play (I cannot lucid dream and I am often unaware I am dreaming). I freak the hell out and the he goes right into last surprise. My disbelief rages and the surreal moment of two of my favorite things colliding envelopes me as I dance and sing the night away. I woke up amazed by what my subconscious put me through. 

Truely one of the greatest moments in my life I could have ever experienced but needless to say it made my quarantine a little bit better and I just thought I would share.

GameStop is not an essential business during this time as a result most places have a requirement that nonessential businesses close at a certain time. Where I’m at that means they have to close at 5pm though I’m not sure about other places. Y’all need to contact GameStop and see if they are having to have limited business hours and see if that’s currently going on where you live.

Maybe that's too uncharitable, but it seems super common for there to be this unwillingness to *just* enjoy the game. There's always gotta be meta commentary, exasperation and sarcasm whenever there's any actual sincerity in the story, references to/complaints about anime tropes etc. (worst was probably a P4 stream where the guys missed that Rise is canonically 16 (yeah yeah, fine lines whatever), kept making jokes about her being 14, and then later started ranting about the game encouraging actual pedophilia by allowing you to date this ""14"" year old and having her flirt with the MC...based on their own made up version of the game where she's 14, because anime).  
And I know people can like or dislike certain things, can play whatever they want, freedom, choice, etc. etc.  
I'm not making this post to subliminally ""diss"" cynical streamers...I just don't need cynicism in this context. So I'm hoping to find out if there are any streams out there of people playing these games and finding themselves actually engaging and empathising with the characters in the story.  
Like starting P3, being creeped out by the opening and having no idea wtf the Midnight Hour was (until it's I think explained twice in back-to-back exposition by other characters while you're sleeping).  
Or starting P4 and being slightly unsettled by the just kinda unspokenly odd atmosphere, especially since it rains during the first few days so there's no soundtrack. Or being hyped AF watching the reveals unfold after [REDACTED]'s casino palace!  
To be honest I'd probably love a stream of someone being gripped by the plot of Devil Survivor for the first time even more, as all that fucking madness unfolds. But that's almost certainly an impossible dream  
So I guess I'm a typical old man looking for a way to revisit the halcyon days of years gone by. But I'm hoping to live them vicariously through other people's first times, rather than through big budget remakes of movies I watched as a 10 year-old ;P",5,1584984508,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fnnxnm/i_love_the_persona_games_they_start_at_3_right/,Persona5,1

fne3p7,The_Mute_Person,Just your average persona 5 challenge,"I would like to introduce the persona 5 nuzlocke run (assuming this hasn't been done before)

The rules are simple

You must start a new game (cannot be a new game+) and play through the game as normal, with a few twists. The challenge begins past the tutorial, where you must fuse the first 2 personas you find (the tutorial fusion doesn't count, dw about that), and you are not allowed to recruit any new personas from that palace. Think hard about the personas you choose. Treasure demons can be recruited, but not fused until the palace is complete. Hope diamond and crystal skull can only be fused on judgement day, have fun with that.

You cannot use gallows strengthening more than once a day. Fuse to your leisure. Group guillotine is allowed once per palace as well

Now, this part may be the easiest for skilled players. You cannot use the persona that you have equipped if joker dies. This does not apply to personas that are in your party but were not currently equipped upon jokers death. This means you cannot do the following:
-fuse said persona
-pull said persona out of the compendium
-fuse into said persona
-recruit said persona
-itemize said persona
-network fuse said persona
-use said persona in combat
-use said persona outside of combat (healing skills and all that)
-have said persona in your party for any reason
You must delete your persona upon death, never to be used again for any reason.

Obviously, the goal is to get the true ending with whatever personas you use. Nobody said it'll be an easy task. Have fun!",3,1584938614,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fne3p7/just_your_average_persona_5_challenge/,Persona5,1

fmw7sj,MarxieWest,Keep playing or...?,"Hi! So I did a lot of searching on this sub and found similar questions but nothing really specific to my situation. Basically a couple days ago I finally bought Persona 5 after seeing all the hype for it over the past couple years, and suffice to say it has really sucked me in! Especially with coronavirus quarantining and stuff, it’s been a blast having an RPG I can really get absorbed into.

I played for a while before I found out I’m dumb and that the Royal edition is dropping in like a week and now I’m a bit conflicted. Basically I’m around 25 hrs in. I’m mid June, past the first two palaces and now am on a time limit with the mafia storyline. 

General question is should I stop playing now and just start over with the Royal edition? I really am loving this game a lot (and I feel like I’m really going to enjoy all the extra content from P5R), but I feel like if I go all the way through the rest of it in the base game I’m gonna struggle to start all the way from the beginning again w/ Royal since it’s such a time sink, especially since I will have just played the base game. 

Anyway I guess I’m just wondering if I should stop now before I get even deeper in, or if I should just keep playing. Also wondering how drastic of changes the new edition makes, like if I would really get the true P5 experience by just playing Royal or if I should play base game first (or if P5R is different enough to where it wouldn’t bother me to finish the original first).

fmvukk,Fyrestrike14,Story: I had THE dream...but beat up Igor for trying to tickle me,"So, I've mentioned this once or twice in the comments of posts on r/Persona5 and people always seemed to really enjoy it, so I thought I'd make a full post for your entertainment.

So, a while ago (I want to say about a month ago?) I had a dream. It legitimately had Igor bringing me into the Velvet Room in it. It wasn't like a carbon-copy of the velvet room from one of the other games either - no, Igor's desk was on a cliff open to the night sky. There was a velvet attendant in a climber's vest and one of those hard-hats with the lights too, if I'm not mistaken. I don't remember Igor ever saying her name, but I think it might have been Agatha? I might be making that part up though.

So, I wake up in the Velvet room, and Igor starts going on his whole spiel about ""Welcome to the Velvet Room, my dear young man! This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter"" and all that. After a bit, he made a joke about how he hoped that he ""tickled my fancy"" or something like that.

I began to remember a time in real life when a friend tickled me so much and so badly that it was literal torture as a kid. Igor then proceeded to make another tickling joke. That was too much for me.

I sprang at Igor without warning, screaming like a wounded banshee. My fists began flying in a red, reckless fury. I grabbed his pen off of his desk and attempted to stab him with it.

Now Agatha did something in the background, and I appeared back in my own bedroom - but Igor was still there. I kicked him into the wall by the door of my bedroom, and smashed it into him over and over and over and over. I vividly remember seeing that long nose of his snap.

That was about when I actually woke up, but yeah.

*That* is the story of how I was *almost* a Wild Card, but I seriously misunderstood what was going on, beat the shit out of Igor, and ruined it. So, if Igor has a broken nose in Persona 6, you can blame me for that.

When you go to get food from the buffet after Morgan’s prompts you too. You end up eavesdropping on people talking about Kamoshida, but these people are the same people you have to get the letters of recommendation from in Shido’s palace. For instance, if you go to the desserts table the NPC will be named IT Company President, and they have the same character model as the once from the palace. This detail is pretty fitting seeing as here is where you see Shido for the first time.

It instantly knocked me on my ass and they all out attacked me... im still in shock at what happened, i made it to turn 41, so is it just a way to say that ive been on the fight for too long? has anyone else had this happen to them?",2,1584850825,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fmtv5y/spoilers_i_guess_ng_hidden_boss/,Persona5,1

The problem was when i got the the boss of the second palace (art dude i cant remember his name) i just couldnt do it. Now im no stranger to difficulty, played DS, and Nioh and all that crap. The problem was I couldnt determine what exactly I was doing wrong. So I was hoping that this community might be able to give me some tips on what I might be overlooking. The one that sticks out the most to me is i dont buff as much as i probably should be doing. But other than that i am not sure.

1) [Link Here.](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07YMFX4PV/ref=sr_1_8?crid=26STLFP3R5BXT)

2) At the top right, there’s a globe, click it and change to English. You can make your account normally with an english email, english address, english credit card, whatever. Surprisingly easy.

3) Follow a recent guide online on how to make a jp Playstation account. You’ll need this to enter the code.

4) Get package. Took them 2 Days from Japan. TWO DAYS. For $21. 

5) On the very first page, there’s a little slip. Follow the lines to cut it and get your code. Go on the jp account’s Playstation store and scroll to the very bottom. It should be the second or third option from the bottom to redeem code (you can tell which page is right obviously once you click it).

fm1vix,Irustua,I made a Persona 5 Opening Piano Arrangement and now I need your help.,"Hi. I'm a young piano teacher that made a [Persona 5 Opening Piano Arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHHTETvSFJk) and [Persona 3/4 Piano Medley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8NU-1fXCaQ&amp;t=4s), 5 years ago in piano. I live in Chile and my main source of income comes from private piano lessons. The current health climate has forced me to look for other sources of income since quarantine makes it hard to leave the house for me or my students.

I linked my piano arrangement above and if you seemed to enjoy them and want to support me, here you can access [my Bandcamp](https://irustua.bandcamp.com/) to download it for any price you want (even free!). Bandcamp is waiving its revenue just for today so it would make a difference for me if you could contribute to my work.

I'm also starting [my patreon](http://patreon.com/irustua) to create new arrangements of tv shows and videogames if you want to support me there.

During the final calling card against Shido, the Phantom Thieves are all lined up next to one another. INCLUDING Morgana in his METAVERSE form.

Also, in the FIRST PALACE, the game tells you that you can’t use your camera in the Metaverse, so that’s out of the question.

flpynd,thefartbreadkid,"Took me 15 months, but I finally finished Persona 5.","And I'm here to share my elation with you guys!

I started playing in January 2019. After seeing the wild fan reaction to Joker's Smash Bros announcement, I had to find out what's the hype. Prior to this, I've only heard of the game, but never knew what the game is or what its about. So I borrowed a copy of the game from a friend.

Let me tell you, I instantly fell in love with it. It truly was unlike any other game I've played, the visuals, the soundtrack, the characters and personas, even the UI took my breath away. So sleek, so stylish. Never would I thought I would enjoy a game about being a high schooler in Japan. Truly in a league of its own. (I never saw it coming ;) )

Now I can easily say Persona 5 is one of my most favourite games of all time. It kinda took over my life - phone and desktop wallpaper is P5 themed, Igor's theme for my PS4 menu, and I'm constantly on the hunt for P5 merch or figurines. Now I'm more hyped than ever for Persona 5 Royal's release!!!

flk18q,ZANIACKtheManiac,"Never played a Persona game, but I'll be getting Persona 5 Royal (with a $10 Best Buy Gift Card)","I've never tried a Persona game, but I'm excited to finally try the latest one. I buy almost all of my physical copies of disc games from Best Buy, mostly because standard shipping on all game pre-orders always arrive at my house on release day. A friend of mine is a huge fan of the original Persona 5 game, and he emphatically recommended the game to me. So I checked on the Best Buy website to find that there's a new upgraded edition coming out at the end of March that also includes a $10 electronic gift card.  [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/persona-5-gift-card-offer](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/persona-5-gift-card-offer) 

I only bring this up here because this isn't advertised on the Best Buy page that features the game pre-orders that come with $10 electronic gift cards, but strangely omitted Persona 5 Royal.  [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/my-best-buy-offers/my-best-buy-gaming-offers/pcmcat308100050002.c?id=pcmcat308100050002](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/my-best-buy-offers/my-best-buy-gaming-offers/pcmcat308100050002.c?id=pcmcat308100050002) 

I know that Gamestop and Amazon are offering small exclusive collectibles as pre-order bonuses, but I was never a collector of that sort of stuff (but I do like steelbook cases). So if you'd like to get this game as soon as it's released, you can take the $10 store credit you get from it to put toward anything you want from the store later. That's what I'll be doing, though many of you probably ordered the collector's edition already.

So if you fine people have any other recommendations, whether it be video games or anime or just tips for starting this Persona installment, I'd appreciate any replies about that.

fl9zlt,yaboiyos,What character do you not like. Despite the fandom absolutely bashing anyone for not doing so? (And sorry for those people who are gonna get bashed),"Personally, I dislike Makoto, she’s a smart ass, saying something of that essence every fucking turn she has. Her confidant is really boring. EVERY FUCKING turn she gets she’s always like “MaN iT mUsT bE wIeRd FoR tHe DaUgHtEr Of A cOp To Be A PhAnToM tHiEf”. Every conversation it’s some shit like that. And in Kaneshiro’s palace she acts all smart because she can count to fucking 5 at the lock puzzle. I just don’t like Makoto. Everyone says she’s “Cool” and “Badass” because her Phantom Thief attire is biker outfit, and Johanna is a bike, but I just don’t fucking care, she doesn’t even have that much of a different outfit from other characters like Ryuji. And I know some people like her for dumb things like “Oh BuT sHe’S tHe CaNoN sHiP”, but no, there is no canon ship, it’s just the one most implied throughout he story, that doesn’t make it the one that actually happens. She’s also an asshole cuz she calls you to stupid to hangout with her, and forces you to have rank 3 smartness and rank 5 charm. And while some other confidants like Sojiro and Futaba(Best girl) need really high kindness to be completed, they’re at the midpoint of the game, so at that point you should ATLEAST be at rank 3 kindness. But Makoto requires a rank 5 social stat so early. 
TL:DR. I don’t like Makoto.",85,1584624366,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fl9zlt/what_character_do_you_not_like_despite_the_fandom/,Persona5,1

fkypb7,Dank_Memes16,Does anyone in the Sacramento CA area have a PS4 and want P5R for free?,"I'm a pretty busy person these days, and don't have too much time for gaming - and when I do, I'm usually on my PC, as I don't have a PS4. But, with the whole quarantine going on, I've got a lot of extra time, and would love to play P5R. 

So to anyone in the Sacramento area with a PS4 and short on cash, I've got a deal for you:

* On the 31st, I drive to your place to pick up the PS4. Used ones are going on ebay for around $160, so I'd give you $200 in cash as a deposit.
* I'll pre-order P5R on Amazon for $60, and it'll get here on the same day.
* For the next 2-3 weeks, I'll play through the game.
* After I finish, I'll bring back the PS4 and the copy of P5R in return for the deposit.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically you get a $60 game for free if you're willing to wait 2-3 extra weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, Amazon said that they wouldn’t be accepting anymore supplies into their warehouses and would be prioritizing first aid supplies and other necessities. 

Amazon also said that anything they already had in their warehouses would still be shipped as normal. This combined with the fact that I highly doubt Atlus didn’t send out P5R far in advance leaves me to believe everyone will get their Pre-Orders as normal.

fkl3ke,Blue2601,A perspective Persona 6 Velvet room.,"I'm going with a theme of progression, specifically self-determination, for this room.

It would be a dilapidated church with a domed ceiling, almost like the capital building, but it's been converted into an art studio. There would be shards of broken stained glass orbiting the center of the room where Igor sits. The floor would be painters canvas stained to look like a Picasso painting. On the walls are covered with classical Renaissance-esc art that's been graffitied with more modern-looking art.  The attendants would be named Adam and Krempe.

Fusion would be personas turned into paint and the two attendants would paint the new persona into existence on canvas. Fusion accidents would be the attendant fighting while painting and messing up. Persona isolation would be them posing for a painting and having to sit still.

Fusion sacrifice would be the persona being unwound into a string and being woven into a canvas.

Persona itemization would the paint being peeled off the canvas and being wrapped around the blank weapon.",0,1584513203,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fkl3ke/a_perspective_persona_6_velvet_room/,Persona5,1

Today I’ve learned it’s pretty much standard stuff: a story DLC mixed with QoL and other changes. But for reasons I cannot comprehend it’s sold exclusively together with the original game as a stand-alone experience for a full price. On the same platform and the same generation that the original game was sold and where I’ve already bought it. And I can’t pay, like, 30$ to upgrade. 

Like, *what* *the* *hell*... Is this some kind of a joke or am I missing something? Why do I have to rebuy the whole damn game for a full price to play the DLC and see the new true ending?

I have beaten Persona 5 twice because it is one of my favourite games (when I had time to beat them). My only concern with this edition of the game is the new character added to the phantom thieves. Like does she add something like a new element to the story of the game. This is similar when I played Atlus’s other game “Catherine Full Body” , I felt that Rin(new character) was kinda unnecessary to the plot.

fk8oa9,roshanismybuddy,Beginner needs help,"Hi,  

I've played about 5 - 10 hours on the PS4, albeit over the course of multiple months. Now I'm at the point after the tutorial (I believe).  
However, with the amount of options (and a latent compulsion to optimise in RPGs) I feel a little lost, which is why I am asking your advice. I'll try to formulate some questions.  
Current state of my game is that I went to that doctor and bought some meds, bought a weapon for someone, and now the game tells me to enter that PE teacher's castle whenever I'm ready.  

* What should I do? The city is big and the school building is confusing. Should I just go right into the castle?
* How relevant is all that chatter in the environment? It gets really tiring to listen in to all the students, but usually in games I consume every line of dialogue there is.
* What should I do when fighting? Kill monsters, try to get loot or try to get their ability? Do I get the same XP for either of these actions?  

I'd appreciate some answers and input on how to spend the next few hours in the game until I get the hang of it.",4,1584464226,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fk8oa9/beginner_needs_help/,Persona5,1

I pre ordered from my sisters amazon account since she is a student it’s cheaper and we all use it for prime. So anyways I was in a chat with my friends and one of them mentioned that they had to buy theirs from GameStop because amazon canceled theirs so I go to check myself and sure enough it’s been cancelled so I go searching all throughout the internet and I found similar post made quite a while ago and it looks like their out of stock everywhere... reminds me of last year when GameStop cancelled my KH PS4 pro so now for two years in a row my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.

fk6gy8,theloneshewolf,"As the western release date for P5 Royal draws nearer, what are some changes you guys hope to see?","Pretty much what the title says. With Persona 5 Royal coming out in a little less than half a month, I wanted to get an idea of what kinds of changes and additions people are hoping for. I apologize, by the way, if anybody has posted a similar topic recently but I didn't see any. Anyway, I'll start:

1. Okumura's Palace. It's no secret a lot of fans were disappointed by Okumura's Palace. It's hard for me to put my finger on it exactly, but it was just plain tedious and kinda boring. In particular, I hated the part where you had to run around flicking switches and get jettisoned into space multiple times. It was neat the first one or two times, but then it became tedious. Not to mention, this was one of the few parts of the game where I got genuinely frustrated and had to look up a guide because of how confusing the whole damn thing was. 
2. Ryuji being an asshole to Morgana for no reason. Speaking of this part of the game, it was also where Ryuji decided to start acting like a jerk towards Morgana for no real reason. Granted, he was kind of a jerk towards him even before that, particularly during the games equivalent of a beach episode, but still, he said some things that were kinda uncalled for. At the same time, I guess I can kinda understand, since Morgana has been picking on HIM for pretty much the whole entire game.
3. Annoying stealth minigame in Shido's Palace. Persona 5 features stealth in much of its gameplay, so this might sound a bit hypocritical, but it was *fun* stealth gameplay. In Shido's Palace, during certain segments, you're forced to turn into a rat and run around trying to get past shadows without being spotted. It was a good attempt at mixing things up a bit, but ultimately annoying and also I personally cannot handle that kinda stress lol. I hated feeling so helpless!
4. A little more warning for how important Mementos is going to be to getting the true ending. Thankfully this wasn't so much of an issue for me because I went it kind of knowing how important it was gonna be (thank you SuperButterBuns) but I know for others they were somewhat blindsided, thinking that Mementos was more of an optional sidequest. This meant that, for those who hadn't been keeping up with it, they had to try and marathon 60ish floors iirc. Though, that's assuming they haven't done Mementos AT ALL but still.
5. A little more backstory for Joker. I get that Joker is supposed to be somewhat of a blank slate for us to project on, but I would like a little more backstory for him nonetheless. At the least, a bit more of an explanation for why his parents dumped him in the care of a man they'd never truly met (apparently they found out about Sojiro through a cafe regular that just so happened to be a family friend?) No offence, but it would've made more sense if Sojiro himself was an old friend of one of Joker's parents. Who the hell leaves their child in the care of a complete stranger?! Either there needs to be a bit more explanation as to how Joker's parents came to the conclusion that this was a good idea for their child, or an explanation that  Joker's parents are neglectful/abusive and just didn't really care. Even one or two extra lines of dialogue would suffice, it doesn't have to be much!
6. An option to stay at the end in Tokyo. This one's a bit of a longshot and likely not gonna happen, lol, but I wish there was an option for Joker to stay in Tokyo at the end of the game. Maybe he could call his parents and get their permission to continue living with Sojiro? Or, since I guess technically he's a high school graduate by the time the game ends, maybe Joker could just stay with Sojiro until he's able to get accepted into a college within Tokyo, then he can dorm at the college.
7. An option to play as a girl. Obviously not an option, you're definitely playing as Joker again for P5 Royal, but I still kinda wish there was a female protagonist option like with P3. I know, I know, they said it would take a lot of work and re-tweaking of dialogue and other stuff, so this one's just a pipe dream sadly.",18,1584456426,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fk6gy8/as_the_western_release_date_for_p5_royal_draws/,Persona5,1

&gt;Aside from any additional content, Persona 5 is one of the best games of this generation; A game that elevated the JRPG genre and made the Persona series the king of it. Now Royal has turned this gem into a better version of itself and this is enough reason to experience this version. Persona 5 Royal deserves the highest amount of praise and recognition.

&gt;Persona 5's excesses and its thematic step backwards are issues, but the raw gameplay is so enjoyable, and the characters so vibrant and well-written, that I haven't minded having the excuse to play through the bloat again. Not by any means.

&gt;Whether you played Persona 5 or not, Persona 5 Royal is simply a must play for everyone. There is more content with updated gameplay mechanics that make the game even more enjoyable than before. The new confidants add a new layer to Joker, deepening our understanding of its psyche and our immersion in the process. Persona 5 Royal is just better than a Persona 5 overhaul.

&gt;Persona 5' was rightly praised three years ago with loud hymns of praise. This royal update puts the crown on one of the best JRPGs of the last years. Atlus has consistently honed the few edges and quirks of their fantastic role-playing game and refreshed the gaming experience with countless, useful innovations and comfort decisions. The interesting new additions to the character set fit so homogeneously into the plot that I often caught myself thinking that they had always been part of the story. Moreover, the first-time implementation of German screen texts finally breaks the language barrier, which kept many players at a distance despite their interest. This now opens the door to a fantastic roleplaying game for new players and I can only emphasize: if you can do something with the staging, hit it. And if not, at least take a look at it, because all the praise for Atlus' wacky adventure about students stealing the hearts of depraved people in their spare time is more than justified. All Persona 5 veterans, however, must consider whether the new features are worth diving into the metaverse once again for countless hours. Anyway, I was amazed how quickly 'Royal' managed to tie me up and bring me back into the world of Persona 5. The many meaningful and affectionate innovations once again sparked my old passion for Atlus' sensational roleplaying game.

&gt;Taking a great game and making it even better, Persona 5 Royal is near perfect, and the definitive way of playing one of the greatest games ever made.

&gt;Persona 5 Royale is a marvelous victory lap.

&gt;If Persona 5 was a diamond, the Royal version, with a gigantic amount of changes and improvements, is the treasure of the palace. The spanish localization is the gold that covers it all, and the final detail that makes it a truly invaluable gem for any thief, new or veteran.

&gt;Persona 5: Royal is the definitive Persona 5 experience. Atlus has refined the already excellent base game, trimming the rigid, sharp edges and creating a smoother experience filled with new and interesting activities, characters, story moments, and even an entirely new palace and optional ending to the game. Persona 5: Royal is one of the best JRPG's on PS4 for both new and returning players.

&gt;The gist of it is though; this is more than just a few updates slapped on top of an existing game, it's a complete rethinking of the major and minor components that made the original what it was.

&gt;Persona 5 Royal is the best version of one of the best JRPGs of all time. And it adds subtitles support for many new languages. These should be reasons enough to go out and buy it ASAP.

&gt;The additions introduced in Royal allow Persona 5 to become the excellent JRPG it was always truly meant to be, and it’s a wonderful effort that will surely be appreciated by fans.

&gt;Persona 5 Royal offers so many changes to the core game that it feels fresh, all while keeping its original charm and style. With a brand new story arc and characters, as well as combat mechanics and updates to the social aspects, it's, without a doubt, the definitive way to play Persona 5.

The way he licks his furry cat legs turns me on so much, it puts me in heat. I want to trip on catnip with the little guy too. I'm interested on how you could pleasure him when you're inside of him when he is a bus. I bet you tug on some of his shafts and accelerate that bus down into the depths of mementos. His persona, Zoro, could heal me right up when I start losing stamina after long, rough sex with Morgana. It only costs 3 SP and we can go through every palace in the game weaponizing our sexual energy.

i like to self insert myself into universes i like, not that i end up ever using them, but it's something i like to do, and Persona 5 has recently stolen my heart, so i turned myself into a Phantom Thief! And i wanted to ask for some codename suggestions, and also feedback on the drawing, my arcana is The Justice so i went with a 30's? 20's? detective sort of theme. 

Thank you, and have good day!

So yea, a little late, but ive started this game. Ive got to Futaba palace and i was trying to get as many confidants as possible. But i feel like i cant make them all in a single run coz some of them requires max social stats.
So what the best way to play Persona 5? I know that there is some sort of best true ending. Is it best for 1st run just to focus on main story, maxing social stats and get a standart ending and then on 2nd run try to max all confidants and get this true ending? Or it will be better to get best ending on 1st run? Or there is sorta other way? Long story short, what is the best way to fully enjoy this game? Coz i kinda love it already and want to experience as much things as posdible?

fjeopk,theREALashasaur,PSA - If you didn't preorder the Phantom Thieves Edition you won't get one at launch,"Seriously people, it's everyday with the same question:  


""I didn't preorder the Phantom Thieves Edition but I want it.  I can haz launch day at GameStop??""  


If you didn't preorder the PT edition from some sort of retailer then it is VERY unlikely that you'll get one at launch for the retail price.  Most retailers stopped preorders a few weeks after it was announced as ATLUS made it clear that all units had been spoken for.  ATLUS and SEGA do not generally do a second run on collectors editions for games.  If you didn't preorder the PT edition you will either have to try and get lucky at retail from someone not picking their copy up OR buying online from scalpers on eBay.  The chances of you walking into a GS on launch and picking one up at basically zero.  GS will not be getting any extra copies that where not preordered of the PT edition of the game.  You will not be able to find it a couple of weeks after launch at retail price.

This is why I've taken to this subreddit for assistance.

From talking to mom about the game before, she's told me what she thinks is questionable for a 14 year old to be playing. Basically, she's worried about **language, drug use/reference, and reference to sex/rape**. I've already seen playthroughs of the game and have told her that it's not as bad as some of the stuff I've seen, but unfortunately she abides by what Common Sense Media says about the game. What I'm asking of the community of people who've actually played the game to explain how in-depth those things get.

**Summary:** Can you tell me how bad the language, drug use, and sexual themes in P5 are?                         Thank you all for providing input to help me experience this amazing game.",15,1584319928,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fjc3tc/alright_yall_help_me_out_please/,Persona5,1

We NEED to talk,"Ok guys I wanna start first and foremost with a quick disclaimer that this is not a generalization nor am I saying that all members of r/Persona5 or the people of r/PERSoNA do this, but rather that a good few of both communities have their share in the issue I’m addressing, the issue I’m addressing of course is spoilers, not specifically for 5 or the Royal (albeit those are everywhere and are just as much a problem) but spoilers for the older games specifically 3,4 since I assume less than 10% of you have even played 1 and 2(s)...
While I’m aware that all these games are over 10 years old that doesn’t mean we should go spoiling crucial plot points of these games for new players, Persona 5 is drawing in so many new fans  and while I don’t expect all the new fans to go back and play all or any of the older games I’m sure a good few of the people who play 5 will at least maybe look into playing 3 or 4 as I once did, however the problem with going back and looking into these games or even casually scrolling through the mentioned subreddits is that some people just go and spoil these games like their nothing, And while I could go on for ages ranting about how easy it is to get spoiled on these subreddits sometimes I won’t and instead will leave you with this: P5R releases in a few weeks this will bring many many many new fans to the series and likely this subreddit if we could all make a conscious effort to spoiler tag our posts and do all that we can to protect these newcomers from spoilers so that if these new fans go to enjoy these older games they can, spoiler free, it is my strong belief that if the older games go unspoiled for newer players their experience compared to that of someone who played knowing every plot twist, would be significantly better. I’m unsure how to end this mini rant/call to action so I’ll just ask you kindly to do what you can to keep the other games as spoiler free as possible, Thankyou have a good day :)",13,1584316063,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fjb4t0/calling_all_persona_fans_we_need_to_talk/,Persona5,1

So I was thinking of getting Royal when it comes out at the end of this month, seeing as I’ve never played the game, have heard great things about it, and have a lot of time to kill thanks to the current pandemic. However, I still have two burning questions that I would like answered before I commit to purchasing the game. 

1. Is the main story of Persona 5 and Royal the same? Are there any alterations to the original game, or is the new story content a bonus/expansion-like? I’ve heard there will be alternate endings to the game, so will the original story remain intact?

2. What’s the content you get from the $100 edition? Is it just appearances/cosmetics or is there meaningful gameplay-supplementing content in the ultimate edition.

fiwn7z,HolaNachoCL,Let's Talk: Why a Switch port of P5 Royal makes sense.,"\- Lots of fans (myself included) want it. A port wont hurt the franchise, but only make it more popular. It's a win-win scenario for consumers (im looking at you, fellow toxic console owners).  
\- Atlus West want it. Atlus Communications Manager Ari Advincula didn't have any new announcements to share, but did ensure that Atlus is listening.  
\- Catherine is already coming to the switch, at least there's an official rating from australian gob. So, there's real Atlus interest on the console. Catherine was experimental for new console development. Lets be crazy about it, and say now they're using it for switch porting experience (there's  evidence that points to TMS#FE being a nintendo job, with little input from atlus)  
\- Switch is selling FAST, next gen is around the corner, and we all know first year can be weak for sales given low installed base, so Atlus may resource to Switch owners to keep sales going for persona franchise, since Shin Megami Tensei on 3DS sales are dead. They need revenue.  
\- SMT V is atm Switch exclusive, P6 is nowhere near development (production stages, maybe?) , and Atlus has no big incoming games. It would make sense financially. Hell, they can even port P3FES or P4G for the lack of releases, given the not so great sales of TMS#FE.  The gap between P4 and P5 was 8 years.  
\- P5 Scramble is already on the Switch; accounts for more than 1/3 of sales (wich is great for a spin off).  
\- Early adopters of PS5 wont be buying again, and P5 Royal sales where below expectations in Japan for Sega, the owners of Atlus.

I would say, 70% chance of switch port.

fip56a,Ziggystardust97,Getting frustrated (Spoilers). Need help,"Hi everyone!
I bought this game about 4 days ago with no prior knowledge of it but I managed to pick up on the fact that I can't put off doing the palaces.

Problem is, I'm stuck in Kamoshida's palace. I keep getting to what I believe is just a room or two from the treasure or maybe boss (I'm trying to avoid spoilers myself so I don't know what exactly happens next).

To be more specific, I get to the area where Morganna says the distortion is getting stronger and the treasure must be nearby. Also I can reach the fake painting.

This is as far as I can get because enemies keep spawning on top of me or 1 (sometimes 2) shoting Joker. And if that doesn't happen, almost everyone gets some kind of curse/ affect on them.

I've tried 15+ times, I'm on easy and I'm at level 8. My detection level is below 40%

I'm geting frustrated and don't want to return back to the real world because of the deadline and because I have plenty of items anyway. (Don't have time to use them if I keep getting one shot)

I also don't want to go down in difficulty either.

I'm also having problems hiding successfully because hiding spots don't seem to let me access them every so often. Is this intentional?

Can someone please give me pointers? I'm beyond frustrated and I really don't want to call it quits because this is an otherwise amazing game.",15,1584218462,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fip56a/getting_frustrated_spoilers_need_help/,Persona5,1

I didn't do the Reaper Trick. Since it was my first playthrough, I was scared to fight shadows in Kamoshida's palace as I figured I'd die and found ways to sneak around and avoided fighting a lot of the shadows which knocked back my level for the entire game. I eventually got used to fighting and attempted to level up as fast as possible.

Thanks to guides and Yusuke's card duplication I was able to get several Null Phys skill cards on my personas. The Messiah persona was able to help me greatly because it was able to learn Absorb Phys and I stuck a Resist Curse skill on it to rid it's only weakness.

This was a normal difficulty game, so I'm guessing I was somewhat okay I'm level throughout. But being 10-15 levels under the average brought me to the question:

fian8x,BulletCola,Imagine if teenagers (Other than Akechi) found the Metaverse earlier before Joker came by....,"Like due to some sort of accident that's not intentional.

Due to the teens finding the Metaverse and realizing they make a profit out of killing shadows/demons, they picked up other teens in need of cash to create a group/medium organization that specializes in hunting enemies in the Metaverse similar to Monster Hunter in order to gain profit and power of their newly founded personas. Some of them would get too influenced to the point where they would sometimes hijack others around them including Palace targets so they could gain more money. 

Honestly I would love to see that in a Persona game other than some characters using it for their motives (Such as the Swat team in Sae's Palace) even if it probably doesn't make as much sense. Then again it would probably make the explanations around the setting less satisfying but ehh.",2,1584148933,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fian8x/imagine_if_teenagers_other_than_akechi_found_the/,Persona5,1

fh6s2y,Ant1chr15tSvper5t4r,A bit of a serious post about me...,"You might've seen me out of nowhere, with a random post on here, sometime 3 months ago, as I'm making this post. Since then I've asked some tips about the game, tried to make a scene, from Royal, a meme, and made several comments and posts about how hot Ren Amamiya/Akira Kurusu is, that's all fine and dandy. However, I have not mentioned a bit of backstory as to how I even got into the game in the first place. It's mostly because I wanted to wait until I got the Platinum Trophy, which I managed to do, last night. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I want to explain a bit of my gaming childhood, and later on explain how I got into Persona 5, keep in mind this might be a *LOOOONG* post, I wanted to basically explain which part of the gaming community I came from, and if I do drag on a bit, I apologize. So, without further ado, let me explain...

Before I got into Persona 5, starting off last decade, I was fixated with two franchises, LittleBigPlanet and Call of Duty, these two cultivated my childhood, and I believe that without me knowing of these games, I wouldn't have gotten into Persona 5, 9 years later. While I did get into the first LittleBigPlanet game back in 2009, I didn't play any Call of Duty game until a year later with Modern Warfare 2. Sticking with LBP for a bit, I believe that it was around this time where I accidentally discovered that I could connect online and talk to other people from around the world, keep in mind I was 8 back then. Because of this, the game would essentially become a hub to hang out with randoms and play other levels too, funny enough, it was when I found out about using abbreviations in text like lol, brb or gtg, even though my dumb autistic self didn't knew what those meant. Transitioning back to Call of Duty, even though MW2, which we had when we had an Xbox 360, was my first time with Call of Duty, it wouldn't be the game I'd get into. Mostly A. my parents ended up selling the Xbox with the games we had with it, B. because of the whole online thing I mentioned before, and C. Black Ops 1, which my sister got for Christmas that year on the PS3, would be my true experience with the franchise.

2011 was a great year with not only with LBP and COD, but as a gaming experience as a whole, minus that one time period where PSN was inactive for almost a month. Firstly, LittleBigPlanet 2 would be released earlier that year, and I still stand by my opinion as one of my favorite games of the  decade. For Call of Duty, Black Ops would be the game where I was introduced to Treyarch's side game mode, Zombies. (In case some of you don't know, Treyarch is developer that handles the Black Ops side of Call of Duty, with Modern Warfare being Infinity Ward.) At first Zombies was a thing that I would do for funsies, but after my neesh experiences with the other mode, mostly Multiplayer because I sucked ass at it, I stuck around with Zombies as my go to game mode for Call of Duty. Sure MW3 would be released later that year, but the only times that I have played, was with my cousins who did have it on their own Xbox, we mostly ended up playing the Survival mode on Local.

(Since LBP hasn't had many things happen until a few years later, I won't be mentioning it for 2012 and 2013, because of this I'll try my best to cover them as short as possible.)

2012 didn't have any interesting events going on, besides the whole Mayan apocalypse bullshit. It was however the year where Treyarch would release a sequel to Black Ops, later that year. Zombies, at the beginning of the game's life cycle, was a bit of a rough start. Tranzit was shit, Nuketown Zombies was alright, but you had to buy the Season Pass, before they changed it later, Farm was mediocre, and Town was the only thing everyone played.

2013, was a bit of a turnaround for Zombies with two maps, Mob of the Dead and Origins, both of them widely considered to be the best maps ever released. 2013 was also the year where Infinity Ward would release their next game, Call of Duty Ghosts. Even though it didn't have Zombies, it did have a new and unique game mode, Extinction, a mode where you complete an objective that's given to you while fighting off aliens.

While I did play alot of Extinction in 2014, I only played up until the 2nd DLC, where I stopped playing Ghosts entirely and moved back and forth to either Black Ops 1 or 2. This was also the year where Sledgehammer Games, a company that helped with making MW3, made their first ever game, Advanced Warfare, a completely unique twist on the Call of Duty series with the addition of Exo Suits, aka Jetpacks, I won't go into much detail until I get to 2015. 2014 was also where LittleBigPlanet would get it's third sequel at around Black Friday.

I managed to get LBP 3 on Christmas of 2014, but stopped playing it at around February of 2015, not because the game was bad, which I will get to later, but because the PS3 we had suffered alot of overheating issues, because of that I didn't play much all. For Advanced Warfare it did get it's own take on Zombies as a first DLC, but I only played up until that exact DLC, just like LBP 3, I didn't think it was terrible, but again, the PS3 overheating got a bit too much. For these reasons, I was stuck with using the Wii U, which I got for Christmas back in 2013. However, my mother offered me a deal in which if I were to give her a sum amount of money, aka mostly from my birthday, she would give me her PS4 that she bought back in February, I accepted the offer immediately. It was before I bought and pre ordered Treyarch's next game, Black Ops 3, that I would just stick with a game that my mother bought when she got the PS4, Grand Theft Auto 5, I won't go to any details with the game as a whole, so I'll leave it at that. It was around this time where Call of Duty would receive a bit of controversy with one feature in Advanced Warfare, Supply Drops, where you could either get one randomly in game, or pay, for Headgear, Gloves, Exo Suit designs, and most importantly, weapon variants that can change the game entirely, again I won't go into much detail about it, but Supply Drops would make their way into every game until Modern Warfare (2019), as far as I know. Back to Black Ops 3, when the game did finally release, I was happy to be back with Zombies, the game mode, despite being easy, looked beautiful, and actually felt like Zombies.

Black Ops 3 would get some DLC, in 2016 some good and some ehh, just like Black Ops 2's DLC, I won't go into too much detail. 2016 was my, short, introduction to Overwatch, which despite not into PvPs and having a cartoonish style, I enjoyed alot, I didn't play much of it, only did if I got bored of Black Ops 3, Grand Theft Auto 5, or another game that I also got into, Rainbow Six Siege. 2016 also had Infinity Ward releasing what is probably considered *THE* most controversial Call of Duty game ever, Infinite Warfare. Despite the amount of hate it got, I loved Infinity Ward's take of Zombies, despite being weird and silly, it still felt like Treyarch's Zombies, and it remains as my favorite Zombies game mode done by some other developer that isn't Treyarch. Despite all of that, Infinite Warfare would be the first game where my enjoyment of Call of Duty, as a franchise, would slowly decline overtime.

2017 would be the year that LittleBigPlanet 3 would be *FREE* for PS Users, on February. And after getting the game, playing it through, and a bit of research, slowly started to hate LBP 3, alot, mostly because of the rushed state it was in, the game is a complete buggy mess, and I was actually glad I got it for free, otherwise it would've been a big waste of $20. Back to Call of Duty, Sledgehammer Games would make their 2nd game WWII, a game that I never really got into the Zombies mode because it was simply, *BORING,* so much in fact that after I played it a couple of times from Redbox, I never bought the game for myself, so I won't mention anything else. Before I end off 2017 and head to 2018, I want to mention a game that most of you, who are in this community, are eagerly anticipating me talking about, Persona 5. Even though it did get it's English release, in early 2017, I never really cared about it, any mention of it in a ""Best Game of 2017"" video or blog, I'd just simply skip past it like it's a blank memory, and that's how I'll end 2017.

Because of my decision to not play Call of Duty WWII, and was waiting for Treyarch to release their next game, I mostly went back and forth between GTA5 and Overwatch, Rainbow Six Siege I rarely played. When Black Ops 4 did came out, I was happy to be finally back to Call of Duty for some Zombie killing fun, but as I'll mostly mention in 2019, it was a *BIG FUCKING LETDOWN* for me. 2018 would also be the year where I officially stopped caring for LittleBigPlanet entirely after a desperate attempt to get back into the game, but couldn't. As for Persona 5, just like 2017, I never cared for it, and any mention of it in a video or blog, I'd forget about it immediately, and again leave it as a blank memory. That was until an announcement was made at the 2018 Game Awards that Joker would be coming to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, it was from there where I accepted that a game called Persona 5 actually exist, even  though I didn't own a Switch at the time, but after all of that, I still never gave it a single thought.

Even when Joker did eventually got released, in the buggy state it was in for Smash, I never even gave Persona 5 a single chance, so I won't talk about it for a bit. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, Black Ops 4, was a big letdown for me, as someone who's been playing for nearly 9 years. The graphics, compared to BO3, looked like total shit, the perks system was a mess, an entirely unnecessary side story, the ending to a 10 year story being mediocre at best, and many more problems that I won't dive into. For these reasons, Black Ops 4, will be considered to be my last Call of Duty that I will ever play.

On the flipside though, 2019 would be the year that I fully got into Persona 5, and it all started a few months ago, in August. After seeing more gameplay of Joker in Smash Bros. I had no idea why, but I was always fixated to Joker everytime he showed up. It eventually got too far when I looked up porn for him, YES. I KNOW, IT'S WEIRD. DON'T JUDGE ME. And even though I wasn't gay, I was always attracted to Joker everytime. It wasn't until October where I finally came to my senses that if I was to continue to consider Joker to be, and I quote, ""attractive as hell,"" I need to play Persona 5 for myself and see if it's worth playing. However, I didn't know how I would even get the game since I'm mostly broke all the time, and would have to mostly wait till Christmas to even have a chance to get it. Luckily October was a time where my brother actually landed me at my first, and current, job at a Fry's grocery store, and after a couple of paychecks later, I eventually bought Persona 5, on the first of November.

Now before I talk about the game, I want to mention that I wasn't THAT much of a weeb compared to my brother, even after a body pillow, a poster, Vol. 1 of the manga, and getting the Phantom Thieves Edition of Persona 5 Royal, I still wouldn't consider myself to be a weeb, maybe to the game, but nothing more. Taking that into consideration, I enjoyed the absolute shit out of Persona 5, from the characters, besides Akechi, to the story, which could use a bit of tweaking, to the soundtrack, which I still wish was on Spotify so I don't have to keep using YouTube all the time. After beating the game for the first time, I made my decision of going for the Platinum Trophy, which I managed to get on my third playthrough, last night. This case is special because Persona 5 would be my first game that I ever got Platinum, and I feel proud of all of that.

So that's my story on how I turned from a Call of Duty Zombies addict, to a Persona 5 addict. However despite all of that, I still don't know most people from this community, and I really want to be a part of this community alot more because this seems like a whole lot more welcoming community, and I actually want more people from here to view this, and I'm sorry if this sounds a bit scummy, but please upvote this post so that people who are active can this post, thank you... :)",14,1583969980,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/fh6s2y/a_bit_of_a_serious_post_about_me/,Persona5,1
