fsogdj,wseemillllr,I don’t like the TASM2 suit. It’s overrated in my opinion,"
I’m not a huge fan of TASM2 suit. I think it’s fine, it’s passable, but definitely not the best spider suit we’ve got. I think it’s on par if not a step up (maybe) from the Raimi suits. Personally I really like the clean and sleek design of the Spiderman- homecoming suit (if I want a more comic accurate suit that still looks good). My favorite and the objective best looking is the FFH suit, but I do recognize it’s not comic accurate really.",8,1585699170,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsogdj/i_dont_like_the_tasm2_suit_its_overrated_in_my/,unpopularopinion,1

fsocxh,SamIsBrowsing,The praise that Elon Musk gets on here is completely undeserved.,"Seriously, you only have to look at the way that his staff are treated to get a glimpse of what he's really like. There are numerous reports of him firing people for reasons that are totally unjustified, i.e. his 'rage firings', where he would fire workers simply because he was angry. He also shuts down any attempts by his workers to unionize, but of course that doesn't matter because he's so 'relatable' and acts like a teenager on Twitter. 

There's also stuff like the 'pedo guy' comment towards British diver Vernon Unsworth, who was trying to save the stranded soccer team in Thailand (he also called Unsworth a 'child rapist' in an email to a Buzzfeed reporter, what a guy)! More recently, he's been downplaying the impact of the coronavirus online, sharing false information with his millions of followers on Twitter. Of course, this isn't really spoken about, but once he pledges to making ventilators, it hits the front page with thousands of upvotes. 

I'm not saying that Elon doesn't deserve praise for some of the things that he does, the fact that he is now taking the virus seriously and is actively working to help fight it is excellent. What's annoying is that the majority of people on this site fail to acknowledge that he's a very flawed human being, and give him a free pass because they find him funny. One can only imagine the uproar that would be caused by somebody like Bezos doing some of the things that Elon has.",33,1585698827,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsocxh/the_praise_that_elon_musk_gets_on_here_is/,unpopularopinion,15

fsocio,Lucky0505,Migrant assimilation into society is detrimental to society itself.,"Assimilation

/əsɪmɪˈleɪʃ(ə)n/

*The process of becoming similar to something.*

We want to experience familiar customs, faces and practises in our every day lives. It gives us a sense of control and familliarity that we associate with home. So we, as a society, ask migrants to assimilate in the society they migrate to. 

But the very act of assimilation itself is a direct threat to the progress of a society as a whole because it's sole continuation hinges on it's ability to progress. 

When we ask migrants to assimilate we ask this from the misconstrued conception that the dominant culture is a perfect and complete concept. A concept that is unchangeable. This notion is flawed and the persuit of it will lead to stagnation because a society is never complete. A living society is ever changing and seeks to find ways to adapt to the changes. 

This means that to ask of migrants that they must assimilate is folly. They must learn, yes. But they must also add. And in return a society must learn from migrants.",7,1585698786,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsocio/migrant_assimilation_into_society_is_detrimental/,unpopularopinion,0

fsoazd,MuddyWalruss,The Reddit re-design is better than the old design,"The old design i find to be clunky and it when i went on it for the first time, it took me much longer to navigate than when i first joined reddit with the re-design. I find it annoying to have to click on every individual post to see the content. With the re-design, you can just scroll and it'll show you pics/videos immediately without having to click (if they're uploaded directly to reddit, imgur posts still have to be clicked). Text posts give you a small preview as to what is written in the post and most of the time it gives you enough info to decide if you want to click and read the full thing or just ignore it, whereas on old reddit, you have to click every time. 

The text underneath the post that says who posted it, what sub it's from etc is small and doesn't stand out, and sometimes makes it difficult to read with my bad eyes.

The comment threads aren't clearly defined and most of the time, i can't really tell when a new thread starts and ends. To be fair, new reddit doesn't do this perfectly either but it's a hell of a lot easier than old reddit.

The new design is cleaner, easier to navigate and more convenient than the old reddit. I understand that some people use it because that's the reddit from the good ol' days when reddit wasn't a shit show and reminds them of those years but it's inferior to new reddit.

fsnj1x,IchTanze,I think chop sticks are superior to forks.,"I grew up as a jewish kid in California with mostly forks. Then when I was in community college, I had a chinese roommate. He made the same statement to me, and to show him up, I switched over, just to prove they were worse. Well, I never stopped using them almost 6 years later. I only have those avocado pit forks for when guests come over that can't use chop sticks. Use them for cooking, for stews, for stir fry, pasta, rice, salad. I work outdoors and they are just so easy to transport in my day pack. Easy to clean. Love chop sticks and hate when I have to use a fork.

Edit: spelling

Edit 2: more reasons I put in the comment section

&gt;I would say it makes me eat slower, more intentionally. Instead of just shoveling food in my face like I would with a fork. I like using sustainable products, and wood forks often break when I'm working outdoors, I've never had that problem with chopsticks. Most of my chopsticks are bamboo, which is easy to sustainably harvest. Aluminum often isn't...oh in terms of cleanliness, a fork has 4 or 5 nooks for particles to get stuck in.

fsni7k,justtrynadobetter,“Strict” or “protective” parenting is often child abuse and should be treated as such,"My parents, particularly my dad, were extremely strict with me growing up and still are towards me today (I’m in my early 20s). I wasn’t allowed to have sleepovers, go to school dances or football games, date, etc. I wasn’t allowed to participate in cheerleading even though I was extremely good at it, and could only participate in activities my parents “approved of,” which I happened to have no interest nor talent in. I was essentially forbidden from being myself. I became extremely isolated as it was very difficult to make friends when I couldn’t participate in any activities to make friendships. I was even bullied for it sometimes. My parents are foreign, so growing up in a place where I already stood out (I live in midwestern USA), being forcefully excluded from things by my parents made fitting in even more difficult. My parents said they wouldn’t let me do these things “because they cared about me.” They still say if they didn’t care, they would’ve “just let me do whatever I wanted.” I suffer from lasting effects of this shit parenting, and I think this should be considered child abuse. Fuck “cultural differences.” If you’re going to move to a different place, you should not forbid your child from participating in the culture they live in. Social isolation is a known form of emotional abuse. A parent doing it to their child is no exception. It has lasting psychological effects.

fsncee,Placide-Stellas,Having material possessions doesn't invalidate a pro-worker or even socialist political stance,"I've seen a lot of people bashing the celebrities who sang Imagine, and John Lennon himself, for singing about ""imagining no possessions"" from within their mansions. In my view, there is absolutely no contradiction. There are poor and exploited people in the world not because of the ""greed"" of individuals, such as musicians or movie stars -- who admittedly earn way more than necessary to live comfortably. People in the world suffer because there is a *system* in place which generates unfathomable wealth by underpaying workers and seizing the value created by their labor. If all celebrities wanted to donate all their money to poor people governments would actively do anything in their power to stop the money reaching people in need because the system in which we live *require* exploiting the poor as a way of creating economical and political power. And even if that money did reach poor people all you would have is the ability to lift a certain percentage of the world's population from poverty, but the economy and politics would still be controlled by multi-trillion-dollar groups who could then work to devalue this money and sustain their control. Rich celebrities have little to do with any of this, or almost as much as the average middle class person (I say almost because there are a some celebrities who happen to also be brand owners, and that is a somewhat different story), and I'd rather they use their voice to defend the opressed than be cynical.",11,1585695252,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsncee/having_material_possessions_doesnt_invalidate_a/,unpopularopinion,2

fsnabk,FungalFanatic,Chimpanzees are not that strong,"I always hear about how chimps are 5 times stronger than humans and how they could easily tear someone apart.The truth is, [their strength is greatly exaggerated](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2138714-chimps-are-not-as-superhumanly-strong-as-we-thought-they-were/). In reality, a chimp is only about 1.35-1.5 times stronger than a human of the same weight, and since chimpanzees tend to weigh 71-100 pounds (females) or 88-130 pounds (males), most humans are actually stronger than their chimp counterpart. Fights between primates usually come down to size and strength. We also have intelligence and the ability to strategize on our side. Thus, the average adult human could beat a chimpanzee in a fight, provided they were in reasonably good shape. 

I feel that part of the reason people think chimpanzees are so much stronger than humans is the case in 2009 where a chimp attacked and brutally maimed someone. But you have to remember that the victim was an old woman who was not expecting the attack and the chimp was exceptionally large (200 pounds) and on Xanax, which is known to increase aggression/violent behavior.. This is an entirely different scenario than a fit young adult prepared to do battle with a normal-sized chimpanzee.",15,1585695058,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsnabk/chimpanzees_are_not_that_strong/,unpopularopinion,4

Most people, especially men, don't realize that a lot of girls that they would consider being ""natural"" are actually wearing natural looking makeup, not bare face. Those same men are usually the first ones to ask a girl if she's tired when she's *actúally* natural.



And with plastic surgery, I see a lot of people, men and women included, bash on women that get plastic surgery but don't realize that most times, those are just the ones they *notice*. And then when a girl ACTUALLY shows her natural body, people have a bunch of opinions about it, a lot of them not good. It seems society just wants women to have plastic surgery that's not noticable but still enough to sastify the public, not an actual natural body.



And third, a lot of people don't realize that the people they think at ""natural"" and aren't Photoshopped are just professionally done so it looks natural. We bash on bad Photoshop because well, it's bad. But if its good, most people won't bad an eye or question it, especially if it's for something as small as removing a mole on someone's back.

fsmu9m,AntiqueTechnician5,I wish that I believed in god,"When I'm talking to other atheists, I get a sense that they feel superior to religious people and somewhat feel bad for them for being lied to. 

While I've never believed in any form of higher being myself, I don't see why you wouldn't want to. It seems like it would be comforting to think that the universe is looking out for you and that everything happens for a reason and that being good means that you'll go to heaven or any of the other stuff. 

Also, I've cases where religion really does inspire good in people. People like to discredit religious peoples good deeds just bc they're doing bc of their religion. But, in my opinion, does the persons intentions really matter? If the only reason that someone gave money to a homeless person was to try to get more points to try to go to heaven or whatever, that homeless person still got the money and it was still a good deed. 

I'm not Christian (I was raised Jewish) so I've never had the experience of believing in Santa, but it seems like such an amazing thing to be able to believe in something magical and supernatural in the universe. I think that believing in a higher power would be a similar experience and that religion isn't a bad thing.

fsmr4f,AeMasterClasher,The Office season 9 is very good,"Don’t hate me here, but I think that the final season of this show, despite the opinions of many, is very funny and watchable. I think that Season 8 is extremely flawed, as Michael leaving made the show hard to watch for this season. However, I believe they turned it around and the show got good again. The two big reasons I hear for why this season is not good are 1. The Pam and Jim plot line was bad, and 2. They threw Andy’s character to shit at the end. To address the first point, I’d say that Pam and Jim having marital problems was a great plot line. I think that this gave Pam’s character a chance to shine, as well as making their final moments onscreen together extremely touching. To address the second point, I agree that Andy throwing his life away was very hard to watch. However, it gave Dwight his big chance to be manager, as well as enhancing his character. Also, Erin not ending up with Andy actually made the finale better in my eyes. I think the show ending without a cliché “everyone’s happy” was a very interesting choice that I stand by. So if you guys rewatch the show regularly, as I do, don’t let the internet tell you that season 9 is bad. Give it a chance on your next rewatch and don’t group it in with season 8.",0,1585693321,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsmr4f/the_office_season_9_is_very_good/,unpopularopinion,0

fsmglz,hamsterpopcorn,Men should pay on the first date,"Woo boy I feel like I’m gonna get a lot of heat from this but here it goes.

I am a young woman in college studying science and I am extremely career-driven. I go on a lot of dates with men. When I go on a date, I do bring my credit card in the event that the man might not pay (and I go under the impression that he won’t), but typically if he doesn’t I feel it’s in very poor taste. If a guy discusses with me beforehand that he doesn’t have a lot of money right now and can’t cover me, then that’s okay, I might still go out with them if I find them to be interesting. But in the event that I go out with a guy and he leaves me hanging at the cash register or asks for separate checks when I’m not expecting it, I think it’s kind of rude. Typically after the third date, I’m okay paying every once in a while or splitting it, but I think for at least the first three dates a man should pay to show me that he is interested. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy, even if he gets me a $2 scoop of ice cream I’ll be happy, which is why I think it’s tacky if he isn’t even willing to put in that. 

My reasoning behind this is somewhat s3xist, but true of the world. Women hold the value in the dating market, they typically start at a high market value which depreciates over time. Men, on the other hand, typically start out at a fairly low market value which increases as they become more successful. I could go on and on about my theories about how men and women experience attraction differently, but the truth is that they do. A man’s success is important to me, I want someone who can show me they can take care of me. I want a man who is willing to take me on a date and pay and not expect anything in return because I feel that says a lot about his character. In return, I dress up and try to be engaging and interesting and not lead him on if it’s not working. If a man doesn’t pay I see him as more of a player (not saying it definitely makes him one, that’s just how I perceive him) and feel that he won’t even invest anything into me or the date. Also as a very busy woman, my time is very precious and I need to see who is actually worth my time. 

Call me old fashioned, but the way this world works (not that it’s fair at all) men pursue women and not the other way around. Since women have the higher market value, men should work to win their favor.",286,1585692396,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsmglz/men_should_pay_on_the_first_date/,unpopularopinion,0

I've been skinny my whole life, and never been confident in myself until I realized my progress in my weight gain journey.

fsme46,iCE_P0W3R,The Irishman is a bad movie *SPOILERS JUST IN CASE*,"I know this take is super late but whatever I'm in class and this was on my mind:

I understand that people like this movie a lot, but I don't see it. I have seen it on more than one occasion so I could try and understand why people like this movie. I have talked to people who have seen it. I've watched video essays on it. Despite all that, I don't understand why the movie reached such acclaim. 

Let me start by listing the things I like about this movie:

Al Pacino's performance as Jimmy Hoffa is damn good, most likely being the best performance in the movie. He's a fantastic actor, so this comes as no real surprise. I wouldn't say anything extreme like it was better than his role as Michael Corleone, but it was a strong depiction of Hoffa. His personality, while grounded in the blue collar work ethic and his hard-fought virtues, is damn-near larger than life. Every scene he's in, he commands your attention, with his brazen, confrontational attitudes, to his somewhat humorous manner. 

Joe Pesci, while absent in some long stretches of the movie, gives a good performance of Russell Bufalino. This was a noticeable departure from the more fiery roles we come to expect from Pesci (like Goodfellas and Casino) but he nonetheless is one of the best parts of the movie. There's an empathetic, caring nature of his character that contrasts nicely with the more conniving, apathetic business side of him. 

The story is legitimately interesting. I understand this mostly lies in the real-life mythos of the disappearance of Hoffa, but it's impossible not to gawk at the sheer size of the story. Constant power struggles between various mobsters? Union campaigns? Fighting for control of the Teamsters? There's nothing about the story that is not pure intrigue.

Now, for the things I dislike about the movie:

***FRANK SHEERAN***

Frank Sheeran is a character with a complete lack of depth and personality. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic here, but could they have made the protagonist any more unbearably boring? I don't even fault De Niro too much for this because he does the best with what he's given. Unfortunately, what he was given was a completely blank slate, and Scorsese said ""Be like this."" Sheeran is a ""witness character,"" meaning that he watches more powerful and interesting people around him do a bunch of important and powerful shit before he gets his one moment to do something that defines the story. He has few, if any, discernible character traits, except that he was violent one time to a shopkeeper and he is friends with Jimmy Hoffa. We're \*supposed\* to believe that this character is important and wields a level of influence and power, both in the mob, and in the Teamsters, yet, somehow, he is constantly powerless to affect any change in the story. On top of this, he has no character arc. He starts killing people, and he hurts a shopkeeper one time. At some point down the line, he kills his friend, and that makes him sad. 

It takes him 3 hours and 47 minutes of film time to realize that killing is wrong? Oh my god, what genius! 

I understand that what I just said was reductive, but I'm trying to illustrate the lack of thought given to an arc that was placed there rather intentionally. He's a hitman, a union leader, and the confidant of Jimmy Hoffa who struggles in his parental role as he resorts to violence too quick. There is a rich arc there that should be told, but this has to be balanced with him not doing anything so the main story can play out.

My main point about Frank is that the movie doesn't know whether or not to make him important or completely passive. Let's be clear: passivity has a place in storytelling. One of the best examples I can think of is Nick Carraway from The Great Gatsby, where him being a witness makes more sense and serves more of a purpose. I'm not saying it's impossible for a passive witness to be given an arc, but that's a challenge which requires a deft hand that the writers did not have when writing the script, as the film constantly flops between ""Oh he's important and a character you should focus on!"" and ""lol nvm not really.""

***CHARACTERIZATION***

Building off the last point, the characterization has serious issues that no one seems to address when talking about this movie. We are constantly given information about characters via cutaways, montages, or people just fucking telling us. Let's keep talking about Frank, since we were just talking about him. We are told Frank is a hitman for the mob when we see a montage of Frank throwing guns in a river while his older self narrates over it, and then we are shown that he has grown to be more violent in regular dealings when he beats up the shopkeeper. Aside from the fact this is very sudden and takes place over the course of 2 minutes, why did this change have to happen if we were just going to be told it anyway? Why not introduce him as a hitman struggling with his growing violent tendencies? Also, and much more egregious, why the hell is this the only real incident of his violent behavior affecting him outside of work? That's clearly what the scene is trying to portray, but it only happens once. If his character is changing, then it isn't just a one-time thing. Patterns form, with the violence potentially growing, as his character steeps deeper and deeper away from acting how he used to. Eventually, with his murder of Hoffa, he comes to realize how much he's changed as a person. Not only does that sound more intriguing, it's also more realistic.

This affects more than just Frank though. What about Russ, who was one of the better parts of the movie? Well, we see him dine with Frank a few times in the beginning, and we are literally told that Russ saved his life and that he is a great friend to Frank. Obviously, this is meant to communicate that he considers Frank a friend. Unfortunately, this suffers from the same mistake as last time. Russ is straight up absent for a huge part of the middle of the movie, where he all but disappears. How are we supposed to believe that he's a great friend if we've just seen them eat and bowl twice and we're just told it once? That doesn't make the audience believe anything.

The story is severely limited by the way in which characters are built, as it weakens the impact that arcs can have, and it puts a severe damper on potential character moments. Instead of letting us see how a character is, we have to constantly be artificially told how things are, or how this character is, when a better alternative would be to show us naturally.

***THE TONE***

This movie is pretentious as hell for a story that has such a weak protagonist and characterization. Everything about this movie screams ""TAKE ME SERIOUSLY!"" as if it was a fucking Christopher Nolan movie. The muted colors, the ham-fisted symbol of the daughter, the loaded cast of people who do absolutely nothing, and the hilariously dumb stills of characters with their faces and their deaths. 

I understand that they aren't 1-to-1 but tell me that those still shots of the faces with their fates isn't as ridiculous as this video:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOpapeX6Vzs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOpapeX6Vzs) 

Also, how quick was the whole idea of ""painting houses"" dropped? As soon as he stopped painting houses in the movie. I mean, he does this whole pretentious, ""Before the mob I thought when you said you paint houses, it meant you paint houses"" speech. Then, when they get on the road, they do a laughably bad edit of the car and these 3 black frames coming in and out saying ""I HEARD YOU PAINT HOUSES."" 

This movie is horribly pretentious for the story it tells. Hell, it's pretentious for the story it's trying to tell too. At its best, while it is a story about the Teamsters and the mafia, the story of a violent father, and the story of the greatest Union leader the US has ever seen, it's also not a super complex analysis of the way of the world or human nature. I mean damn, the Godfather is much more thorough in its dissection of capitalism, family, and masculinity, and if it had some of the shit that was in this movie, it would be too much. 

***ANTI-AGING***

This isn't as serious a criticism of the movie but I think it's important to mention: the technology is fucking stupid. 

First off, while I acknowledge how impressive the technology is, it's extremely limited in what it can do. Sure, these characters look SLIGHTLY younger. They also still move like old people because old people are the actors getting re-aged. Yes, if they sat down in front of me and stood still, I would be convinced, but no, I watched a geriatric De Niro beat up a shopkeeper with slightly smoother skin. It wasn't convincing.

Second, how much age does it really take off? De Niro does not look that young in the beginning of the movie, like he's pushing 55-60. That's an achievement, but it's not super effective to the audience. Plus, any age after that still makes him look really damn old. I have to be honest, I thought De Niro looked the same across however many years it was supposed to be. It didn't impact my viewing experience tremendously, but it was weird.

This brings me to my main point: why the fuck wouldn't you hire younger actors? Sure, I understand that these people are all legends and they can act and all that, but this younger generation has some great actors too. Is it in any way possible for the mantle to be passed? Mob movies are among some of the greatest movies ever made. Do we just let the flame die out because there will be no more actors from the original movies? What a ridiculous notion. I want to see new movies, new art being made. This movie feels like it's supposed to be a farewell, but art is supposed to evolve. You don't just close it up and say ""We're done, no more."" You keep the style going until it's outta gas. Using old actors will probably kill off this genre quicker than the styles being outdated.

fsm9t5,ohhhhhdang,Everyone except for Universities are doing something to help out during the crisis.,"The US government has passed multiple stimulus packages to help out people and businesses hurt by the Covid-19 crisis. 

Businesses all over are stepping up and doing what they can to provide emergency medical supplies to hospitals. Also, I have seen multiple stories of business leaders forgoing their salaries during this crisis.

Universities have done nothing. The top 100 Universities all have over $1 billion dollar endowment funds. Harvard alone has over $38 billion as of 2019!
Source: https://thebestschools.org/features/richest-universities-endowments-generosity-research/

Its time for Universities to step up now more than ever. These Universities should be paying off or forgiving loans to students and graduates. Many recent graduates are hardest hit by this crisis and cannot afford to this debt that these Universities are responsible for.  Also, why arent the college administrators and deans forgoing their pay like business leaders? In many cases they are compensated very similarly.

fsm6v2,NotYoSpeed,"If you're not feeling sick / a nasty person, going outside and not staying indoors is OK.","Edit: Title sounds confusing... Basically: ""If you're a clean person AND not knowingly sick, you should be able to do as you please.


This whole ""stay at home"" and closing all the stores down has gone wayyyyyy overboard. We're letting our governments play parent and infringe on our freedoms while we bitch and cry over some overblown doomsday hysteria (not to say it shouldn't be taken seriously; read below)!


-----


Explanation:

• If you're an idiot and wipe your snot everywhere, don't cover your sneezes/coughs, or spit talk near people, then you should stay home (or better yet, change your habits).

• If you're old, of ill health, or younger (just in case), you should take extra cleanliness precautions and avoid people above or stay home.

• If you're generally a clean person and not an asshole to spread your germs about like the selfish idiots mentioned up top, then there's nothing wrong with going around and doing your normal ass shit.


Just use some common sense people! Don't be so close to people more likely to suffer and take greater precautions to not spread your potential filth! Stop giving political assholes more power over and use your brain.


----


Rant:

Sorry if you feel insulted, but I'm stick of hearing/seeing these scapegoat excuses because ""oh, think about the poor people who'll get sick though! You're so selfish!"" No dummy, those idiots shouldn't be out there in the first place if they can't use common sense to keep their distance/clean! Plus, I'm not one to go around spreading germs nilly willy. If we keep letting our fears get the best of us, soon enough we'll loose all our rights to our government for the sake of FEELING safe. I know some of you trust your government no matter what they say, but you should always take things with a grain of salt and not always drink the koolaid. Also I'm probably not gonna read comments, cause I'm way too exhausted from this bs and just need an outlet to scream.",28,1585691546,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsm6v2/if_youre_not_feeling_sick_a_nasty_person_going/,unpopularopinion,0

I think that’s what annoys me, it’s like a calmed down voice of someone named Karen. It’s just so overused and honestly I think they make a bigger deal out of it than it is.

fsm1g2,Blue_Chameleon_,Pre-Ordering video games is a huge waste of money,"Alright, let me explain.

Thirdly, companies just use it to make extra sales. They add special pre-order bonus content that most of the time is nothing more than some stupid cosmetic. For example, Smash Bros. Ultimate would give you a Mii costume of Rex from Xenonlade Chronicles 2 as a pre-order bonus. The game cost $60, and all you get for pre-ordering is a Mii costume that’s nothing more than that? Also, I know Ultimate was a good game, but if any other game sucked and was $60, you just wasted money because you didn’t wait to see any reviews or anything that would change your mind.",16,1585691042,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsm1g2/preordering_video_games_is_a_huge_waste_of_money/,unpopularopinion,6

fslyub,CoffeeSlutt,Being a famous musician was easier in the past,"Like look at Bach's cello suite. It's a series of arpeggios. That's it. 

In the 80's... You have backcombed long hair and can shred a guitar scale? You're in.

60's? Can put together 4 chords and sing over an acoustic? Sorted. 

90's? Can make something interesting on a synth? Know how to sample? Solid mate, the doors are open. 

Now you have to 

1. Have a production quality that's absolutely flawless. Side chain compression, limiters, EQ etc. You need to know sound engineering and how to perfect that craft. 

2. Have the best equipment. General MIDI  won't get you anywhere. Even with basic plug-ins like Steinberg's Prologue, it won't get you far. Unless you have something like Serum or Omnisphere or something you're going to struggle in the EDM scene.

3. Be able to market yourself. Being talented isn't enough anymore. You're not just going to go from playing in local pubs to playing at the Royal Albert Hall from skill alone, you need to advertise and sell yourself. 

4. You need to be able to pull in a crowd's attention and have presence. Bands like Tenacious D are pretty good but they aren't massive. Why? Because it's Jack Black and Kyle Gass. He isn't much to look at, he doesn't pull in a crowd, young people aren't going to pay loads to see them. Maybe as a supporting set sure, not as a headline. 

5. Just be able to write something that hasn't been done before. Traditional metal is dead, rock and roll is dead, punk is on its knees, nu metal is dead, gothic rock is dead, metalcore lasted around 7 years before dying. Think about how easy it was to come up with a new sound in the 90's? Drum and Bass and Dubstep was in its early days, Post-Hardcore was just developing. Rap was nowhere near as well produced as it is now. 

It was just easier to sound unique. Now it seems like everything has already been done and there's nothing new. I thought I made something new. It was a hip-hop beat with a deathcore-esque breakdown beat (heavy emphasis on china cymbals) layered over the top of it, strings (cellos, violas and violins), a lo-fi piano and a tropical house bassline.

Dogs are *pack animals*; they take their cue from the Alpha. Which means that if you, as a pet owner, do not establish yourself as the Alpha, your dog will assume that he/she is, and attempt to lead the way every time you go for a walk.  Using a ""choke chain"" won't solve the problem. It's just cruelty.

If you get a dog, establish yourself as the Alpha. Take the time needed to leash train them. Take the the time needed to assert yourself as the Alpha, the master. Otherwise you'll just have a bad experience.  Most dogs that wind up in shelters are ones that people discard because they can't handle being walked all over by their pet.

I'm particularly discussing the notion that ""Male Entitlement"" as it is used to describe men who try to be nice to women to show the woman they are interested that the man is worth their trouble, does not exist.

Of course some men do nice things for women they have an attraction for. This is normal &amp; it is equally normal that these men feel dejected &amp; disappointed when the feelings aren't reciprocated.

Inb4 ""But were not saying all men are acting entitled"" well yes you kind of are. Don't admonish a guy who is being nice to win your affection. He may not want to continue the friendship once he has been rebuffed. These things are normal. 

So to all the men &amp; women out there. Men, try to be nice, if she isn't interested take it on the chin. That's not to say you can't be disappointed, just manage your emotions. Women you're equally not entitled to our friendships as much as we are not entitled to your interest. It goes both ways.

fskswn,Pasha2300,All drugs should be legal and the government should be the ones selling them.,"-People’s actions shouldn’t be illegal if it doesn’t harm but them self.
We allow people to smoke, drink, jump out of planes, do steroids etc. because we as a society agree that the human freedom to do what ever we want, is more important than the risk of getting hurt or dying. 

- Portugal legalizing all drugs proved it can work.
This article from the guardian https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it explains how Portugal who were battling an opioid crisis, did not see an increase of drug related problems after the legalization of all drugs, as a matter of fact it had quite the opposite effect. “The opioid crisis soon stabilised, and the ensuing years saw dramatic drops in problematic drug use, HIV and hepatitis infection rates, overdose deaths, drug-related crime and incarceration rates. HIV infection plummeted from an all-time high in 2000 of 104.2 new cases per million to 4.2 cases per million in 2015.” It should be noted that the new drug law wasn’t the only initiative, they also focused more on actually providing help for people with drug issues, which I think should definitely be an integral part of an all drugs legalized system.

- It would put the money into the proper hands.
Gangs and some terrorist organizations are funded by the sale of drugs. Unnecessary loss of lives happen all over the world every day, because there is a constant fight, for who gets to cash in on the enormous worldwide drug demand. Instead all this money could be used for healthcare, infrastructure and education.

-It’s safer for drug users.
Drug users often find them self in the shitty situation, of having to buy from some sketchy guy in an alley, hoping that it hasn’t been cut with anything dangerous, to increase profit margins for the criminals.

fsksml,Anaksanamune,People who break check are less to blame than the people going into the back of them.,"First off, I don't think brake checking is right or good or correct etc, however a lot of the time the person behind being checked as just (or more) at fault.

If someone stops dead in front of you, you should ALWAYS have enough room to come to a complete stop, even if you are a trunk. In fact as a professional driver truckers should know exactly what the stopping distances of their vehicles are.

For the people who don't want to leave a gap because someone might pull into it - that's a poor argument, its not like you are suddenly going backwards because you let someone in, and if everyone left a suitable gap it would be a lot easier for cars to zipper in a junctions and safely change lane in general, merges and changes would be more effortless. People close up the gaps to be selfish a lot of the time and then if one person opens up a gap everyone pulls in front of them (making them want to close it up) - if everyone opened up this would not happen.

My two concessions are where you have not had time to open a gap because someone has just pulled in front of you or where the brake checker is deliberately baiting. In both cases it is simply impossible for you are avoid the situation.

fskp9h,whatisthisreddit2,Stop gatekeeping. You aren't a policeman.,"Yes, this is still a thing. Gatekeeping mental illness, what kind of books/shows you like, hobbies/interests.

If they don't have every single type of merch imaginable, that's fine! That doesn't make them any less of a fan!
Mental illness is a whole different boat. It doesn't make sense to say you have one, that people shouldn't tell others they don't, while you're doing the same thing just because of what? You don't feel that person is valid enough? You don't like the person? You think all mental illnesses are the same and they don't have any type of spectrum? Then you have the ones that say that it's for attention when they're the ones that constantly post about how they made one small mistake and are acting as if that mistake started a big war, which don't get me wrong, that's okay and how they express themselves, but to do that and turn around and tell someone they don't have oke because they don't talk about it or they don't anymore or whatever it is?? No, you do not have the right to do that. You do not have the right to tell someone that what they experience isn't real just because you feel it's not. If you inow how it feels to be told that, why do it to other people? Why come up with different conspiracies as to why and if this person is lying?

fskoo4,InfiniteFreshness,"Infatuation is not the same thing as love and ""love at first sight"" is not real.","Everyone feels infatuation when they first get into a relationship with a new person, especially at a younger age. This happens when you absent-mindedly ignore  ""red flags"", slip issues that would normally bother you under the rug, and genuinely believe that you could spend every waking moment with this person. This feeling lasts for a couple of months until either one of the people in the relationship loses the spark. 

At this point, things generally happen in one of two ways; the relationship will become more and more unstable through a ""push-pull"" dynamic, or the one who falls out of the spell first will make the mature move of ending the relationship. The mature ending of a relationship doesn't happen often because people hate to make others feel like they aren't enough, especially after sharing the wonders of intimacy with them. Usually, the one who loses interest first will try to hide it for months, because they either assume the feelings will come back, or have the patience to let the relationship deteriorate enough to the point that they've coerced the other into breaking up with them to spare themselves the burden. This method always damages the one who felt like they were ""in love"" the entire time. Cheating, lying, and manipulation are always involved when one person has mentally checked out of the relationship long before the relationship actually expires. 

^(\*I'm aware that other factors can be involved in why some couples stay together\*)

True love is not a trail of never-ending fairy tale romance, it's accepting and compromising with the flaws of another person and this can't happen until you spend a lot of time with someone. Love does not abruptly expire one day because you think you've found a better potential prospect to give your heart to. Love, at first sight, is the same thing as infatuation and people should be more inclined to tread lightly when feelings like that arise. People can call love whatever they want I guess, but infatuation has nothing to do with love beyond obsessing over the idea of who you think someone is and what they will do for you in life.",7,1585686737,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fskoo4/infatuation_is_not_the_same_thing_as_love_and/,unpopularopinion,2
fskokd,AndyTheGreat7,"A great villain is what makes a movie great, not so much the hero...","There are some movies that are an exception to this (mostly because the hero is an anti hero), but generally I think the villain is much more important to the story than the hero is.

The hero is almost always cliche.  The hero only has limited motives, where they have to dedicate themselves to taking down the villain and almost always either have a struggle with the past, their conscious, or relationships.  They also do not have much control of the plot of the movie.  It becomes really hard to think of a hero that is unique to the heroes of other movies.

Meanwhile the villain is the exact opposite of what I’ve just stated.  Yes, they have to fight the hero, but at the same time they don’t have to focus their motives on that hero.  The villain could be “evil” because of a broken past, because they were brainwashed, because of a drive for power, because they wish to be, or even because they are doing something wrong that they think is right (like Thanos in the recent MCU movies).  The list goes on and on.  The villain also can have complete control over the plot, they cause all of the problems, they can manipulate others, they can set up traps, there is limitless possibilities for what a villain’s motives are and how they decide to go about their plans.  There is a lot of room for creativity.

In my opinion, this allows the motives of the villain to become unique, and that makes their motives interesting.  Everyone knows how a good person would handle a situation, they do the right thing, but a villain can handle a situation however they want to, which makes their evil decision making that much more interesting to me.

To me, a good villain can make a movie great for me, even if I do not care about the subject of the movie itself.

TL/DR:

The hero does not have as much flexibility in their character as the villain does, so villains have the potential to become much better characters.",25,1585686729,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fskokd/a_great_villain_is_what_makes_a_movie_great_not/,unpopularopinion,4

I wouldn't notice these if I had headphones on. People say that it's the only way to find rhythm but the body is intrinsically designed to find a rhythm and will find it anyway.

fskdqn,K1_AZ,I don't like food and I feel eating is a chore,"TL;DR My whole life I have been consuming food for the sole purpose to gain weight. I no longer get enjoyment out of food and eating always feels like a chore.

I am a male, late 20's, tall and athletic. My entire life I have been underweight and it heavily affected my personal life and athletic career. I was bullied for being tall and lanky, and in sports, I would often get hurt because my frame could not stand any physical contact. From a young age, I ate as much as possible, every meal, for the sole purpose to gain weight. My parents encouraged me to eat whatever I can and as much as I can. I chose food not because I enjoyed the taste, but because it had extra calories, protein, or whatever I felt my body needed. Peanutbutter and marshmallow fluff sandwiches every night before bed, protein shakes non-stop, no excuses. 

I am now older, athletics are behind me and I still have a slender build. Unfortunately, now I find no enjoyment in eating food. I can easily go a day being satisfied with one meal because I avoid cooking and don't find food to be nourishing or refreshing. To me, eating is a chore. If I could, I would hook an IV up to my arm that would give me nutrients and I would never have to eat again.

This post was more to vent and see if anyone else feels the same. If anyone has advice on how to enjoy eating again, it would be greatly appreciated.

fskbu3,minecraftjahseh,Grape is the best Jolly Rancher flavor,"If you've ever seen a bowl of Jolly Ranchers get passed around, you know the pecking order. Blue Raspberry first, then Watermelon, then Cherry, then (reluctantly) Green Apple, and finally Grape. For some reason, everyone hates Grape Jolly Ranchers. Well let me tell you something:

Grape is the ideal flavor.

Grape Jolly ranchers have the most perfect balance of any flavor. Watermelon is too sweet. Cherry tastes like Play-Doh, Green Apple is too bitter, and Blue Raspberry tastes too artificial. Is Grape too sweet? No. Too bitter? No. It sure as hell doesn't taste like Play-doh, and while it is artificial (yeah, real grapes don't taste like that), it doesn't taste anywhere near as artificial as the other flavors. 

So next time you see a Grape Jolly Rancher, do what I would do, and take it. There's plenty for the taking, anyway.",21,1585685628,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fskbu3/grape_is_the_best_jolly_rancher_flavor/,unpopularopinion,7

Now on a similar notion, I think contributions should be based on equal amount. If I was making a million dollars, my spouse 100k, we both should contribute say, 20k instead of 20 %.

My opinion is that this game is actually great and actually competes with all ss games.Look,I get it,The first encounter and the second encounter(especially the HD remakes) are amazing,the best serious sam games,those were my childhood.And Serious Sam 3 is awesome too due to the good graphics,improved gameplay,more campaigns,secrets,etc. but everyone seems to hate Serious Sam 2 for being too cheesy or too funny.Meanwhile,people would complain the first encounter and 2th encounter are too serious or the jokes are not funny.pretty  hypocrite.Cro-team wanted to try something new,and it worked.Look,here is the thing,the sky is blue,grass is green,you cant change that.If croteam tried to do a serious game,half of the community would be upset it did not have many jokes.If it was the opposite,the other half would think it is too cheesy or funny.But if you try to do a mix,and have little of both in one game,both sides will be unhappy.I loved serious sam 2 dialogue,how Sam Stone now gets much more character development,the colorful graphics,the good jokes,and the enemies(the fat ones that attacked Simba City).The Gunplay was even better in some aspects than the first encounter in my opinion,mainly because the guns felt easier to use.Yea it was very cheesy but it was extremely funny and enjoyable,and it really seems like croteam really tried to make a good game(and it did,my opinion).Such a shame it gets too much hate,people focus on the negative side but never try to see the positive side(I am saying that as a pessimist).For a 2005 game,serious sam 2 had god-like graphics,and the serious engine(also used for the other games) was the best,ahead of its time.Even better than source,it actually took a lot of time and effort for other engines to truly defeat serious engine.Also,after all,I love Serious Sam 2 not for the graphics,dialogue,or enemies,mainly for the fact that it tried something different and that I appreciate. No other popular franchise in that time like cod,gta,etc. had the balls to make a change like serious sam did. It is an unique game,and that is why,in my opinion,serious sam 2 is an underrated fps.I do not know how many users in this subreddit know about serious sam,because doom,halo,duke nukem,etc. are much more popular but I really hope someone sees this,because this post is not meant to create an argument between the fans of serious sam(those who dislike ss2 and those who don't) I respect others's opinion,i understand why people might not like it.",0,1585685560,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fskayk/i_love_serious_sam_2and_like_it_more_than_the/,unpopularopinion,1

fsk7su,redbloodywedding,"Mao killing tens of millions of his own people does NOT mean Hitler gets a pass for ""ONLY killing 6 million Jews""","As a Taiwanese-American and ancestors to those who were willing to oppose and walk away from that whole debacle in China, I'll be the first to say that the events of communist China are horrific.

And I'm also very much against any communism. It was a tragic time in our world history, that was all about tearing our neighbors down because fuck keeping up with the Jones, let me just kill them and take it because I feel entitled to their stuff.

As an American I do believe in meritocracy, and unfortunately we are seeing a slow ground swell of potentially a populist/communist revolt building here in America.

I clarify this because I can already tell I'll be accused of being a commie. I can feel it already.

And I genuinely think red blooded muricans are just living in pure fucking fantasy at this point. Including downplaying the horrific atrocities in the concentration camps for the sake of defending white superiority.

Mao from what I could tell in his biography that I'm listening to literally was so delusional that he literally believed death was actually a good thing for people based on his writings. This night be a ruse, or again Mao himself must've been just fucking crazy, not outside of the possibility.

Hitler strait up thought other races were inferior and ordered the burning of people and their families. Not much grey area there.

My argument is based on one of intent. And maybe we can discuss what's worse, unintentionally killing tens of millions, or intentionally killing 6 million Jews, as well as all the people in the direct wartime conflicts.

I could even argue that because politically we didn't care enough about the Chinese to intervene to begin with that that's how the cancer of Communism spread and by our inactions (despite historically being so empirialistic in the past) is what lead to so many deaths.

Let's also be clear, it's mostly conservatives that want to defend Hitler's actions and there is also a massively clear bias against the Chinese not because of ideology, but pure xenophobia. They could care less about the deaths the Chinese, but rather politicising and excusing the actions of their right wing posterboys.",17,1585685289,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsk7su/mao_killing_tens_of_millions_of_his_own_people/,unpopularopinion,3

fsjwfw,The_Troutman,"Lawyers are completely useless, and are often holding society back from prospering.","To better understand why I feel the way I do on the issue I should provide some background information.  I am a 19 year old community college student from the rural mountains of Pennsylvania.  I've lived on the farm my family has owned for the past five generations, and I plan on becoming a State Trooper, (Please just ignore this, I don't care what your thoughts of the state police are.)  

A large piece of why I dislike lawyers lie in my Uncles life.  His wife cheated on him, stole money from him and sent it to her parents account (over $100,000.) Got a boob job with his money, and took everything out of the house before he got back from business.  She sued him for complete custody of the children, and was in the midst of getting a divorce.  

Any lawyer (4 defended her) who would ever defend her, try to take a man's family farm, house that he built and paid for that is on his family's land, and take the mans kids is no man in my eyes.  

This part of my opinion is from personally viewing what all occurred during this time, and how corrupt and evil lawyers are.  They can be nice people, but if they are willing to get paid at the expense of this man who was a hardworking father of two, by a cruel woman, than they are evil to me.

The second part of my opinion comes from a time before I was born, that I have studied lately because  of my interests in the machine.  My Dad had  a 1983 Honda 200 ATC that had sat in our shed for as long as I can remember, I was never allowed to drive it when I was younger until a few years ago.  My Brother who is 14 asked my Dad to get it running again, and after a month of work, I witnessed one in action.  My Dad had driven, (and wrecked) ATC's since he was 12 years old, and he was quite comfortable on his Honda, doing many wheelies, and other stunts only possible on the ATC.  

After watching him, and riding it myself I realized these weren't anymore dangerous than a dirt bike or four wheeler.  It may have been more difficult to run, but if ran responsibly there was very little to worry about.  I have wrecked side by sides and my pick up truck before, and I have yet to have any incidents on this ATC.

After driving them, I witnessed the 60 minutes special on the ATC, and how bizarre the arguments were.  It was strictly propaganda, and the people who blamed the ATC for the accidents refused to blame their children's actions, nor their decision of buying their 8 or 9 year old a full sized machine.  Personal responsibility I feel has been killed over lawyers suing everyone and anyone with bizarre arguments.  Some people may feel different on the Three wheeler, but after viewing my Dad and his twin brother riding I have no doubt that accidents occurred from experienced, untrained, and noncareful drivers.   

Lawyers pushed for the government to ban these machines, and in 1988 the federal government banned them without looking at the individuals.  

Today in America people would sue gun manufacturers for getting shot, or anything that makes them upset or hurt.  I feel there is a proper time to sue, and lawyers should have a place in the system, but from my experience most aren't any good and care about their wallets more than their morals.

This is just my opinion on the matter, and if you feel different, thats okay.  If you are a lawyer, than I'm sorry if you felt offended, but these reasons are why I feel most lawyers are a drag on society.",26,1585684303,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsjwfw/lawyers_are_completely_useless_and_are_often/,unpopularopinion,4

People wouldn't be scrolling through Myspace in a restaurant or getting caught up in the ""app"" when out with friends. The days when you'd have to actually open a laptop or go on your home computer to add the photos on whatever site you were on. Now I see so many people taking photos and posting them to social media as its happening instead of just taking the photo and waiting until they get home to post them. When I attend a Mardi gras parade I always see some people taking videos and going on all of their social apps to post them as the parade is going and even seen a few people get hit in the head because of it.

If we as a society can agree that exposure to many different ideas and beliefs can enrich a child's life, then everyone can be the child's father and mother.

Personally I've never had an issue with people being toxic since probably I was a kid, when I was a kid there used to be people I beefed with, but then I had a realization and figured out it was just me, I was such an asshole, and from then on I just had more of an open mind and legitimately considered everything they taught us in school about morals, like empathy, mutual respect, honesty, loyalty, etc.

fsjkz4,JD2625,"Formula 1 deserves a lot more credit than what it gets, and has gotten over the last few years.","As a truly global sport, Formula 1 gets a lot of attention. It's arguably the most popular motorsport in the world. This also means that there's a lot of people to criticise the sport.

Over the past few years some fans have cried out against the racing, suggesting that the sport is dead; that all the races are boring. I would argue that the races have never been better.

However, this isn't my main opinion regarding the sport that I believe will be unpopular. The sport gets lambasted for being a bad influence when it comes to subjects like global emissions and the amount of money in the sport; or even the drivers (read as: Lewis Hamilton) who take part.

In these instances, I believe the sport is shown in a misleading light. For example, two years ago the Mercedes engines reached the unprecedented achievement of surpassing 50% thermal efficiency. This was after just 4 years of the current specifications of engine regulations being in place.

In the early 2010s McLaren brought energy recovery systems into the sport, essentially broadcasting the possibilities of self-charging electric motors to the world. This technology then progressed into being a fully integrated part of the powertrain, where today (and over the last 6 years) the engines used by all teams are self-charging hybrids. Couple these two huge technological achievements together, and it could be argued that they present a direction better for the environment than plug-in hybrids or fully electric cars.

This, of course, is balanced out by the sheer miles than the teams and the full circus travels every year to all the corners of the globe. This obviously causes a massive carbon footprint. However, without the travel, without the global scene and therefore extreme level of competition, it's unlikely the technological achievements would reach the heights that they have done, and therefore the world would never have seen them.

Moving onto our current crisis. All of the UK based F1 teams have come together to help out in the manufacture of hospital equipment. Europe alone is in need of at least 30,000 ventilators. Mercedes is aiming to produce 1,000 ventilators per day. In the past week nearly 8,000 have been produced by the teams combined. This is just one example of how they are helping during this trying time.

Of all the sports, F1 is using its resources to truly make a difference and save lives. Something that should be enshrined and remembered once we make it past the current worldwide problems.",0,1585683277,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsjkz4/formula_1_deserves_a_lot_more_credit_than_what_it/,unpopularopinion,6

fsjewp,Riprollonect13,Popular music has improved over the past few years,"**TL;DR at the bottom.**

So many people are complaining about ""modern music"" not being nearly as good as the music they grew up with, and I understand that.  In fact, I was one of those people up until these past couple of years.

That being said, I think popular music has been getting better over the past few years, especially 2019 and 2020.  Of course you still have plenty of crap, but for the first time in a while, I'm hearing a lot of really good songs too.

Just look at some of the new artists.  Four years ago I had never heard of Post Malone, Lewis Capaldi, and Dua Lipa, and now they're producing phenomenal chart-toppers like ""Sunflower,"" ""Circles,"" ""Someone You Loved"" and ""Don't Start Now.""

I'm also hearing older artists like Maroon 5 and Eminem pulling their acts together.  Maroon 5's new song, ""Memories,"" is their best song in at least five years, if not ten, and Eminem's past two albums have managed to return to his early 2000s form without completely abandoning his growth as a person.

However, The Weeknd really sold me on this opinion.  Coming from somebody who hasn't been a huge fan of his, I can genuinely say that ""Blinding Lights,"" ""Heartless,"" and the rest of his new album are incredible, and it wholly deserves all of attention it's getting right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**  Over these past couple of years, not all of the popular music has been great, but I've heard some really great songs from both newer and older artists, especially The Weeknd.",0,1585682745,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsjewp/popular_music_has_improved_over_the_past_few_years/,unpopularopinion,1

fsj8v5,sibre2001,Americans have become so comfortable sending young Americans to die quietly on the other side of the world during emergencies. So now they are becoming hysterical when a crisis affects them.,"Man, Reddit is on fire right now with ""The government can't stop me from going to the bar!"". ""The government can't order businesses to shut down!"". ""The government can't tell me to quarantine!!!""

Guys, whatever your opinion is on if the government should be allowed to these abilities, it is undeniable that the government does have these abilities, and has used them many times in the past. 

The government has the power to shut down businesses during an emergency. This isn't even a debate, and the government owes nothing to the company for lost revenue. If a business is shut down forever by the government, there may be a case for ""Regulatory taking."" But even that law is made for companies that get taken over by the government and still ran. ""Taking"" would be a hard, or probably impossible case to win if the government closed you down for an emergency. 

And let's not leave out that the government has the power to draft you into the military and send you to the warzone of their choosing. And if you refuse, the legal punishments are up to and including your life. The government not letting you go to the mall is child's play compared to putting a rifle in your hands and sending you into a meat grinder, like what happened to my grandfathers and probably a lot of your grandfathers. A lot of us never got to meet our grandfathers due to the same thing. My great uncle and my great grandfather died in wars they were drafted in. How about you?

Over the years, each of our favorite politicians took more and more power, and all of us cheered to ""own"" the other side And yes, your side did and is currently doing it more than you are comfortable admitting.

Classmates and even professors would go off on long rants about things that really aren't a political issue.

There's not even any kind of locator as to where to fucking go. EVEN WITH NOCLIP I got lost in an area for 70 minutes before I found out where to go.

fsit4n,captain_ahah,We should never physically return to campus in any mandatory sense.,"Instead, we render a digital campus of our respective universities, like we’ve rendered buildings and entire cities down to the detail in platforms like Minecraft (or similar ones). The University of Minnesota Gophers have already done this, by the way. 

Then, we do what no one has done, is this: From our PC’s at home we log on/into this virtual campus, and our avatar walks around the campus, sits in a virtually real desk in a virtually real classroom, and chats and waits for the professor to show up. The professor shows up and teaches us. The white board behind him/her is a little screen with a PowerPoint presentation. We are all at home on but on our computers, and rather than staring at a screen, it is a bright, sunshiny day on campus where we virtually also are.

This is how classes should be held from now on. It saves on overhead, reduces the stigma against online degrees, and requires us to engage just as much (if not more) than in person.

Also, now that the campus is free of students for the most part, save social events and other things, the campus now exists as a place to hang out and do administrative duties mostly. Students need not brave the elements, or be attacked by people on the way to/from classes.

fsiqen,jjtnd1,Expanding playoffs is bad for sports.,"This has been on my mind with the recent NFL news that they will be adding an additional team from each conference to the playoffs and various similar MLB proposals. (I do support the MLB making changes to get some kind of baseball going on this year - obviously the virus presents unique circumstances - but I worry about Commissioner Manfred messing around and making changes permanent.) Basically, if you’re adding new teams to the league I can understand gradually growing the playoff field so that your percentage of the league participating remind the same. Neither of these leagues are, though. Otherwise I feel like it cheapens the regular season when you have half the league in contention for a championship rather than only the best teams, who deserve to be there by merit of their successful regular seasons. 


I think these proposals diminish what the true goal of playoffs should be - deciding the best team in the respective sport that year. 


I understand that Cinderella stories are great and I love upsets as much as anyone. Theres definitely something to be said about getting hot at the right time, being clutch and putting a shocking run together. There’s no reason we can’t have a wild card/fringe team go on a great run like that in any league, but I am firmly against a mediocre .500 team having that shot. The fact that the Knicks weren’t mathematically eliminated for as long as they were is laughable and I’m a fan. 


Obviously the NBA is on the extreme side of the spectrum, (which is why I think the first few rounds of the NBA playoffs are largely unenjoyable - an 8 seed has beaten a 1 seed what just 3 times in the past 20 years? 6 times ever or something like that?) whereas on the other side of things, in college football for example, you only have just a 4 team playoff. Still, if the NCAA were to expand the CFP, Alabama, Clemson, Ohio St would literally be in it every year, even with a couple of losses. Part of why I love college football is that every game matters so intensely. I could go on and on about college football and scheduling and conferences  and everything but that’s a whole other can of worms. 


Of course owners are going to vote for playoff expansion because it means more money. It’s that simple. The leagues themselves are expansion proponents for the same reason. Many of the sports fans I know welcome the change because they’re like hey, this improves my team’s shot at playing meaningful late season games. Who doesn’t want to see more action? Well, me, for the reasons outlined above.  None of my teams have won championships in my lifetime (Mets Jets Knicks Rangers Notre Dame) bit when one of them does it will be incredibly fulfilling. I’ll cry like a baby when the Mets finally make it happen...


Anyway, I hope my opinion isn’t as unpopular as it seems to be based on social media and discussions with friends.

Im sorry but as an adult you are not beholden onto playing monkey see monkey do. A good idea is a good idea not based off of the author but based off its premise. When my dieing grandfather takes a puff and tells me not to smoke cause it will ruin my life, he is right. I could take the position that hes right there smoking and i will also cause he cant ""practice what he preaches"" or i could say damn hes right. In the same vein getting the same advice from a Mormon missionary who has never smoked in his life and is speaking out of religious zeal, hes also right. 

Imagine if the roll model argument was feasible in court. ""well your honor, i know spousal abuse is illegal but seeing as police officers generally physically abuse their spouses more then most, so i followed suit. I mean if they uphold the law they should set the example."" 

Pointing out hypocrisy serves to diminish the hypocrite but it does not serve to effect policy, procedure, or action. My brother is a nurse combating this virus and when he comes home he seldom washes his hands and he gets bored so he frivolously goes to walmart. Is he a asshole? yes. should i do what he does in my daily life? no. why would I? when he tells me its getting worse and we should quarantine i agree and let my own convictions and not his actions persuade me.

fsip4x,captain_ahah,We should never physically return to campus in any mandatory sense.,"Instead, we render a digital campus of our respective universities, like in Minecraft or something similar. We log on, and our avatar walks to the campus, sit in a room and wait for the professor to show up. The professor shows up and teaches us. The white board behind him/her is a little screen with a PowerPoint presentation. We are all at home on your computers, but we are also virtually IN an classroom. 

This is how classes are held from now in. It saves on overhead, reduces the stigma against online degrees, and requires us to engage just as much (if not more) than in person.

Also, now the campus exists as a place to hang out and do administrative duties mostly. Students need not brave the elements, or be attacked by people on the way to/from classes.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:

2) I’m not judging you for whatever reason you chose to go into your major
3) I’m just commenting on what I tend to see when it comes to people valuing STEM over other majors. I think STEM is incredibly important, but I’m saying that it is not the ONLY important field of study

STEM majors like engineering, chemistry, biology, etc. undoubtably have significant value today, but it’s annoying to keep hearing people say that humanities majors aren’t important or just don’t have enough worth to pursue in the first place. I feel like a lot of the sentiment that STEM degrees are the only worthwhile majors came from schools pushing STEM so hard over the past couple of decades that the importance of subjects like art, english, music, philosophy, and learning other languages was overshadowed. Other degrees can be just as rigorous as a STEM degree, they’ll just involve a different set of skills. The entire narrative that your degree isn’t worthwhile if it isn’t STEM just ends up pushing people into a field that they don’t really want to go to in the first place, all because there’s this stigma around more humanities-based fields that’s been fed to them for years. The effects of other subjects may not be immediate visible, but they still have a lot of influence on how we run our society.

But they have friggen pools and tennis courts and basketball courts! And? I've got a PC, books, pets, workout equipment. I can get the same fun out of my time as they can in terms of entertainment, just because they have more options doesnt really mean much at all.


Most celebrities live a far more active and social lives than any of us. I work till 730 pm everyday (well i did) and would have to be in bed by 930 pm the next day to do it all over again.

fsieg4,TRPaway2019,TV Broadcasts Suck At Sports,"TLDR: The camera angles we get on TV suck for people who want to see all of the play.

I like football. Not just watching what’s on TV, but at also like to see the things that are often left off of screen during live play. Often you don’t get to clearly see something until the right angle of the replay pops up.

But still it is frustrating when two seconds after the snap the wide receivers and the corners and safeties covering them are completely out of the shot while the camera man actually starts to zoom in!? Like seriously the players are moving that —&gt; way. Or the other way but you get my point. Most of the exciting action with the trash talking WR is going to only be seen if the ball gets thrown his way.

I enjoy the player interaction and the live mic stuff as everyone else. But if we had one camera that focused on all the play that would free up the other camera men to zoom in on whatever, hopefully interesting line of scrimmage wars that can happen.

Also in Baseball the main camera angle should be directly aligned with the very top of the mound and the center of home plate. This gives the home viewer the best angle short of what the home plate ump sees and gives the Astros the best chance of cheating.",1,1585679619,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsieg4/tv_broadcasts_suck_at_sports/,unpopularopinion,2

fsiadb,mwilleync77,"Telling someone they're ""special"" is worse than telling them they're just like everyone else.","No one person is inherently ""special"" by any means.  We all have strengths and weaknesses.  What is special, is the choice a person makes and the difference they make in the world.

When you tell (for example) a child that they are special, they start to form inaccurate ideas of how reality applies to them such as, rules that don't apply to them and getting the idea that they don't have to go through the same hardships as others in the world.  They don't really develop fully as a person nor do they push themselves to grow because they already view themselves as more valuable than other people. 

If you tell them that they're just like everyone else, it becomes clear that they have to deal with the same problems and hardships and, that they have to be strong enough to make it through those trials.  They don't get entitled nor do they expect to be treated differently and they begin to understand that others have just as much of a right to happiness as they do.  Because of this they are able to look internally and find what differentiates themselves from others (strengths and weaknesses) and, this allows them to effectively function in society and actually have a positive effect on the world/the people around them.

A few years ago, I could easily find WHATEVER I typed into the search bar, no censorship, no advertiser bias, no mainstream website bias etc. NOW, any basic query will give results from the 10 or so websites 'Google approved sites', and the search seems to ignore many terms in my search and focus on 2 or 3 words it feels like focusing on. Consequently, the search results are useless.

Google is still the most advanced search engine, but the reason they rose to prominence was because of their ability to give incredibly ACCURATE search results. Now they seem to be going back on what made them the 'best', and imo their search function is a shell of what it once was.",11,1585679170,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsi974/google_search_sucks_nowadays/,unpopularopinion,13

fsi879,Momoftwogirlies,"To those bad-mouthing homeschooling because of the recent virus shutting down schools, keep in mind that pandemic schooling at home may not be a good representation of actual homeschooling.","The recent pandemic has forced families to drastically change their routine and life at home as schooling has gone from on campus to at home. This has caused a lot of strain on parents and children too as most have felt completely thrust into trying to figure out how to homeschool. I've seen and heard comments like ""this is why no one should homeschool"" or ""this is why homeschooling is the worst"". 

I would just like to say that for homeschoolers that I know, this version of homeschooling is NOT an accurate representation of homeschooling. My sister homeschool her 3 children. They have sports to go to, local homeschool group field trips, music lessons, planned to do a science fair, and many other outside and group activities. Homeschooling is not complete isolation like we are having to do now (and if it is then you are doing it wrong, but that's another discussion). Also, my sister prepares for weeks to have curriculum, lessons plans, and a routine before she even starts the school year. It is her full-time job, unlike the parents who have been forced into this crazy position out of the blue with little support and jobs of their own. This is the choice that homeschool parents make (or should be making) if they decide to homeschool. 

If you want to argue homeschooling on it's own, I'm not interested. It is a choice some parents make and there will always be good and bad examples just like anything. If you don't know much about it, I would advise trying to find someone who actually does it (or a few families) to see what kind of options and advantages it can have. Public school, private school, and homeschooling all have their pros and cons. The best way to educate your kid is to choose what's best for your family and then be an involved parent in whatever ways you can.",0,1585679085,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsi879/to_those_badmouthing_homeschooling_because_of_the/,unpopularopinion,2

fsi626,satoukage,"If you’re getting downvoted to oblivion, you probably said something legitimately stupid","I always see this whole idea that Redditors downvote the people who say “the truth that Reddit doesn’t like to hear”, or that it’s the smart people who get downvoted and the idiot “hive mind” who gets all the upvotes getting spread around. I have to disagree with this. I’d say 90% of the time, when someone’s getting downvoted, it’s because they said something idiotic. Obvious exception being if the subreddit is full of morons, and no, most subreddits are not full of morons. I’m talking brain dead subs r/mgtöw
    
I feel this whole “smart people get downvoted” agenda is just a way for people who overestimate their IQ to feel better about themselves when people call them out for the horseshit coming out of their mouths. If the things you say piss literally everyone off and literally everyone calls you an idiot for them, chances are you actually are an idiot. I’m sick of this edgy “everyone’s an idiot but me” crap I see on Reddit.    
    
And while edgelords commenting “the hard truth” often get downvoted, it’s usually not even that kind of bullshit that gets hit the hardest. Usually the people who get downvoted the most, in my experience, are people who are saying something completely off topic or completely missing the point of the post/misunderstanding it in some way.

I understand the hate for kpop, but kpop has hidden gems! Kpop has created an image of a colorful and bubblegum pop music but in reality, kpop also caters diff types of music like ballads, EDM, etc. One example would be CHEN from the kpop boy group EXO. EXO has been one of the famous boy groups in the recent generation of kpop groups and has a (kinda) toxic fanbase but when I listened to CHEN's solo albums, it made me realize that kpop is more than that annoying and colorful music non-kpop listeners usually tend to assume. I am actually more familiar with CHEN's discography compared to his group's (EXO) discography.

fshux1,eaglenotbeagle,I value manual labour far more than academics,"This is coming from a BSc. student. I believe manual labour such as farmers, construction workers, fishermen, tradesmen, etc. have a more important impact on society than we give credit for. In high school I felt pushed to go to university because I had good grades and ""potential"". I enjoy science, but people who work with their hands outdoors all day are doing more for the world than I think most people with a university degree ever will. Not to say that we don't need a lot of the services that a university degree can allow one to provide, we definitely do. But it drives me crazy when people say that they are *just* going to trade school or entering the workforce, because chances are they will end up doing a hell of a lot more for society than Jessica the valedictorian who wants to get her BA in Language Arts.

Man or woman, if you've got calluses on your hands and can use an impact driver I'll respect you far more than anyone working a desk job and making 400K a year. The idiocy of my classmates at university is pretty appalling, I know engineers who thought that lamb meat comes from actual week-old baby lambs, and my neighbour in residence called me to teach her how to put screws in her wall. But societally we consider these the brightest minds of the future, and dismiss people with their Red Seals as ""just a tradesman"".

Yeah, of course we need doctors and researchers and engineers and programmers. I'm not trying to take away from that. But that doesn't mean I have to respect what they do more than what someone in a manual labour industry does, and it definitely doesn't mean they have more intelligence.",6,1585677944,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fshux1/i_value_manual_labour_far_more_than_academics/,unpopularopinion,7

fshopd,Gekox1,I actually don't like Heath Ledger's Joker,"I think after Jared Leto's version Heath Ledger is the worst one, not disrespecting the guy himself, it's a tragedy that he died, but I'm just not a fan of his Joker for multiple reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Personality:

Joker's a very expressive guy, with unpredictable factor and creepiness, but Heath's Joker is as far as you can go with his personality. He wasn't jokey or childish at all, Joker by his name cracks a lot of bad jokes and he's actually kinda childish. Not saying that he's innocent like a kid, but he's cocky and gets mad easily if everything is not by his, confident but incredibly smart and Heath was only able to do smart factor but that's due to incredibly well written movie. I think Dark Knight is a awesome movie but a bad Batman movie, I don't think it captures characters of DC that well, Batman's another problem but he's not who am I talking about.

Heath's Joker when it comes to actions is super Jokery, he does things that are unpredictable and you can clearly see that he doesn't care about money, he'll backstab his guys if he doesn't need them anymore, and I think Nolan got the character well, but I don't think Heath did. Sure he did crack jokes, but he didn't act like a guy that would crack jokes. He was insane but not in the same type of way, if you want my honest opinion this movie could be better if they just replaced Joker with Zsazs. Heath acted more like him than the Joker, he was insane, but in much more chilling manner, he acted much more cold blood than the Joker.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Acting:

Heath's doing a good job with acting, but I don't think he's doing a good job of acting a Joker character. now you could say that this is an original movie with different ideas, yes I agree but I think even if a version of a specific character gets changed, essence of the character should stay the way it was at the beginning. And that's not the problem but I think I figured out why I always roll my eyes when someone says Heath is the most comic accurate Joker ever. What part of him was comic accurate outside from the script? He wasn't jokey, he wasn't childish, he wasn't even laughing that much. Heath laughed like three times in the whole movie and I gotta be honest, outside from Jared he has in my opinion a worst Joker laugh. It's not creepy, chilling nor showy.

I think Jack Nicholson did a best job at chilling laugh, not high pitch, just smooth deep laugh. Cesar Romero did more of a showy laugh, he was so giggly and clownish I loved it. Mark Hamill is kinda a combination, his laugh is chilling while being extremely showy. He has the best laugh by a mile. Joaquin's laugh is probably my favorite from any live action Joker version ever, he makes his laugh fucking disturbing, and you can hear him chocking by it and you just don't feel comfortable while listening to it. My second favorite Joker on live action and this is an another unpopular opinion, Cameron Monaghan's Jerome from Gotham show (I know he isn't the canon Joker, but c'mon, like you gotta be blind to not realize it.)

Cameron's laugh is more showy and creppy, it's high pitched and he sounds amazing when laughing. Sounds if Mark Hamill's laugh was higher pitched and if the Joker was was chocking in his own blood. I dunno why but whenever Joker kinda struggles to breath by his own laugh, I'm already kinda more for it, I just like that idea. Now Heath's laugh wasn't really anything out of those three in my opinion, he just kinda laughed like a regular person. I don't like those engine starting sounding laughs and that's exactly what he picked for him, but it's still superior than HA. HA. HA. HEEEEEEEEE.......

There are also some nitpicks I have but I won't talk about the for too long, I'm not a fan of his suit, it looks to generic, but just in the color palette of the Joker. It looks like something I would wear casually, but just sprayed to have colors of him. I prefer when Joker's costume is more showy and circusy. My favorite Joker suits from LA are Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson and Cameron Monaghan's Jerome. Thing about Cameron Monaghan's Jerome suit is that it's literally perfect, you only need to swap out colors. Jerome has easily the most comic accurate Joker suit ever, but with different colors because WB didn't give them a permission to have a Joker in their series

&amp;#x200B;

I know people aren't going to agree with me and I'l probably get some hate but just try not being a dick. After all this IS unpopular opinion Reddit site so what do you expect. If someone had to ask me to rank every Joker I don't think I could, there is the worst one, we know who it is, and me personally isn't a big fan of Heath Ledger's Joker. Joaquin and Cameron Jokers are my favorite but Cesar and Jack's were a blast to watch and I don't have ill feeling to their flaws. I still don't think we got a definitive Joker on LA. Everyone lacked something. I'm mostly mad about Joaquin and Cameron versions cuz I know writers understand these characters very well, but can't do them. Joker movie was a character study and Joker lacked actions to make him a perfect Joker, although everything else was there, personality, cockiness, laugh, unpredictability, creepiness, he just lacked actions cuz they couldn't add them without this movie being worse or 3 hours long.

Cameron's Jerome makes me mad much more cuz he had actions AND a personality, but he didn't have the right to be the Joker. He was the most Batman Animated Series Joker yet but that doesn't mean he just copied Mark Hamill, he had his own laugh and own character with the inspiration of him. Jerome was unpredictable, creepy, smart, sarcastic, jokey, fun to watch but he wasn't called Joker and both of them didn't have Batman.

Joker is probably the ONLY Batman character you can do a movie about without making it lame or unoriginal, so it does work that my personal favorite live action Jokers don't actually have a Batman to fight. And in the case someone asks me, I think Cameron's Jeremiah is awful, it's worse than Heath's version in my opinion. And yes, Dark Knight is better written than Gotham show, I'm just saying what do I think about Jokers in those two medias. But I do think Joker movie is a masterpiece 10/10 and holy shit was it good.

So what do you think? Share you opinions and just try not to roast the shit out of me for not liking your probably favorite Joker ever",9,1585677410,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fshopd/i_actually_dont_like_heath_ledgers_joker/,unpopularopinion,4
fshoop,throwaway101away101,"Psychiatric Hospitals are, in their current state, far more traumatic than healing","Sooo over a pretty rough year (2018) I was involuntarily hospitalized 5 times for suicidal shit. I was sent to the children’s wards because I was under 18 at the time. Those places are horrible... I would constantly feel incredibly trapped. 

At one place the people were relatively nice (other than the fact that one guy made fun of me- but we got him fired for that. This asshole was laughing at me when I was in a state where they had to hold me down and inject me with a haldol-lorazepam-Benadryl combo (maybe not Benadryl all I know is it was a potent enough combination that two minutes after being injected I physically could not cry or scream or really move anymore. I staggered around a bit, hoping I hadn’t given myself a concussion, and then passed out and slept for like 2 days. I wasn’t in a good place, and he really had the nerve to make fun of me). However they also repeatedly made fun of a 6 year old boy who was clearly not well. And when this other girl would get upset they would restrain her etc rather than trying to offer sympathy and sit down and talk to her. And that’s the place I consider nice. 

At another I was miserable because they forced us to sit in one room all day w/nothing to do whatsoever (I was bored out of my mind to the point where I started writing in my paper diary, with a crayon, about how bored I was). At least at that place though there were some people who were understandable. 

But so often the nurses do. Not. Understand. Mental. Illness. They don’t seem to understand that when you end up in a psychiatric hospital you are your worst version of yourself. The most unstable, unpleasant version because you’re in a shitty place. They could have a little more freaking empathy. 

My worst experience was the last hospital I was in. it was such a traumatic experience that I’ve seriously considered filing a complaint- I probably will when I get around to it. 

For starters I entered this hospital on Lamictal, Zoloft, and hydroxyzine. Hospitals are super stressful for me because I feel trapped but when I asked for my hydroxyzine they said there was some issue with the doctors refusing it, and they couldn’t give it to me. Hydroxyzine is glorified Benadryl. It’s the equivalent of an over the counter medication. It is not dangerous or addictive whatsoever, and basically just makes you a bit drowsy. 

Then, the nurses there were incredibly cruel. Worse than at any other hospital. I begged to have someone to talk to because I was clearly going through stuff and I like to talk to people when I am. I couldn’t find anyone and eventually when one lady sat down and talked to me (days later) it was clear she didn’t care whatsoever and she didn’t really offer any advice. The nurses had no idea how to treat people who were sick and their style was force people to deal with it themselves without helping them at all. They kept people for like 3 days which is extremely short for inpatient, and they were all so detached and mean. Nobody showed any empathy. I cried myself to sleep and spent hours sobbing in the quiet room begging for help from the guy sitting there who just ignored me. 

Eventually after multiple days I saw a doctor and they said they took me off hydroxyzine because I was on too many medications. I was on 3. I’ve been on 7+ before. They saw me for about 5 minutes and when I explained how I’d been feeling horribly trapped and restless and being in that place was agonizing they completely ignored me. The one thing I got from everyone there is that they had no empathy or kindness for the patients there. They never sat down and asked how people were doing or even smiled at people. It was just so so so detached. I had to pretend to be fine just to get out of that hell and it’s the reason I’ve never gone back to a hospital (that and I’m better). I wonder what they’d say now that I’m on lorazepam 2x a day and gabapentin 3x a day... (and no longer Zoloft because I can’t tolerate ssris which they didn’t seem to notice). I’m sure they’d ignore the fact that I’m now stable and significantly better now, and just take me off them anyway, leaving me in horrible withdrawal and instability. It’s like their treatment method was “suck it up and it’ll go away”. Personality disorders and other conditions don’t go away. Depression might, but the stuff I have doesn’t. And they took away what was basically Benadryl??

The day I got out and asked my old psychiatrist he said I could go back to taking hydroxyzine 😂. And he wasn’t even a good doctor and was extremely conservative (understandable because I was a minor at the time, but still). 

I can take like 100mg of hydroxyzine these days and feel nothing, it is not a potent medication. It was basically torturing me for no reason. 


But at some hospitals it’s even worse. People are raped and attacked by other patients, the staff is even crueler and those who are mentally ill are treated like they’re not human. 

We are people. Normal capable people. We are sick, not animals. 

Current day psychiatric hospitals are still on par with asylums. The nurses are cruel and lack empathy, the doctors don’t care how you feel, and they make you worse, not better. I have literal PTSD flashbacks. Being there was one of the worst experiences of my life. I was so incredibly alone, and they did not care whatsoever that I was in pain. They treated other patients the same way. It was so cruel. Instead of realizing that when someone is unstable you should be kind to them, they just locked me in a concrete room and left me there. 

There were a few people who were outliers. At one hospital there was a security guard guy who took me outside, bought me some chips and gave me a speech about how I was a strong woman and I would be okay. He was so kind, and that really helped me. There was also one doctor at the last hospital who was the weekend doctor who laughed and bantered with me and told me he understood and if he were my doctor he wouldn’t have done that. There was also one doctor at a hospital who changed my life by telling me that I have to sit with the pain instead of trying to escape it. But god there were so many horrible nurses and so many horrible doctors and every hospital I went to left me traumatized and worse than ever. 

Probably the main reason I’ve never gone back is that the last hospital was so bad that I promised myself I’d never subject myself to that again. 

The one w/the security guard guy was a place specifically for people w/behavioral issues and was privately run so I think the staff there were by and large a lot kinder (and so even though I had to sit in one room all day it was still my best experience). But at all of the hospital-hospitals the nurses were pretty damn mean. It doesn’t take a lot to empathize with someone... 

I get that I needed to be in the hospital for my own safety, and there have been people who helped there, but the staff on psychiatric wards need to be properly trained to treat mentally ill people like PEOPLE and treat them with kindness and empathy instead of laughing at them and locking them in empty rooms with concrete walls and refusing to let them out. 

If I were in a psych ward rn I would be totally normal and polite etc because I’m stable rn. I’m currently close to my best self. But people who are put in psychiatric hospitals aren’t their best self, they’re their worst self.

fshko6,Linux-Is-Best,We need to CLOSE America and 'shelter in place' the nation.,"We are supposed to be the greatest nation on earth. We chant near religiously, how we are #1 as we spell out, U-S-A, at every global event that we participate.   We continuously boast about how wealthy and powerful we are as a world leader, as we ignorantly announce we have the best minds on earth.  Yet as the virus totals go **UP** both around the world and here especially at home, we continue to act as if it were a normal Tuesday.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, we cannot or we refuse to supply basic medical supplies to medical establishments. As I write this, health organizers (nurses, doctors, etc..) are being supplied with only 1 (single) face mask which they are expected to reuse indefinitely. Businesses big and small are self-declaring themselves as essential as folks return to work.  Every day normal people are acting as if this virus is behind us when in reality it is ahead of us still.

&amp;#x200B;

Our leadership fairs no better, as members of congress, shouting the loudest about supplying people with essentials during this time of crisis and need are being called, un-American socialist. While The White House wants to wish us all a Happy Easter and the opposing side wants to provide us with costly options that many cannot afford personally today, let alone tomorrow.  And that is just concerning our healthcare in 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

**FACT**. - This virus is not going away, today.  It is not going to go away, tomorrow. We as a nation and as a people are not doing enough to contain this.  As I look outside my window, watching the group of people pass by. Or as I take to social media, viewing the recent outing folks have taken together. I know folks are acting as if the worse is behind us while the virus totals go **UP**.

&amp;#x200B;

Deaf and blind to the world and reality around them. Blissfully and sometimes willfully ignorant of the fact that this virus can stay dormant in your body for 2 weeks before you show a single symptom. Meaning, those who did not take originally take this seriously early on, as they finally exit their homes, are going to begin to wonder what that strange cough they have is! And those just thinking to self-quarantine now have likely infected thousands more.  Meanwhile, more than enough people have been continuing with their lives without a care in the world.  With all three types of groups overlapping one another; this cycle will continue.

&amp;#x200B;

In late February there was the whisper of March.  It was only a whisper because no one wanted it to be true. In March the hard sell which said April. Now as we enter April there is the nearly taboo whisper from some, May.  Do you want to know why? We not doing enough!  We keep repeating the same mistakes and this cycle will continue without end until we do more.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to stop and think. We need to take hard action. We need to shelter in place the whole nation. Close all business and redefine what 'essential' really means, while not letting business owners decide for themselves. We need to fully supply our medical facilities. We need to take this seriously.",56,1585677049,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fshko6/we_need_to_close_america_and_shelter_in_place_the/,unpopularopinion,4

But some posts are things or facts a lot of people agree on and they upvote it because they agree.
This is pretty what this sub is rn. 
For example : The one that says that saying the virus comes from china is not racist but hating chinese people is racist is an opinion a lot of people agree on.
If it was an unpopular opinion, then it means that like 40k people (dont remember the number of upvotes) think its unpopular ———&gt; which means that they 1) know and hang out w/ a lot of racist people or they 2) are racist; because they upvoted it
So do you actually think its unpopular or do you just agree with it?
(Cause racist people are probably a minority.)
Im actually just repeating rule 1 kinda.

So upvote this if u think this is UNPOPULAR

fshj70,NelAraby4,School grades are not really a big deal.,"Hello everyone, in my opinion think that school grades are a bit overrated. Honestly, a small difference in numbers among everyone else will not guarantee you failure in life, contrary to popular belief. This is the case especially when you are a hard worker and love what you do. People think that letters define a student when that is not the case. Hard work is what will get you through life. My dad has always told me that only the results matter when it comes to school, because that's what ""the teachers will see."" In truth that is not the case.

Also, I don't think students should be disciplined in any matter for ""bad grades"". Taking away the things that a child likes to do is kind of wrong in my opinion. I have experienced this myself as a student. It does nothing beneficial, but only teach kids to hate school and fear every test. In fact, the only source of anxiety for me during an exam is the consequences for a bad grade. If parents actually helped their children in a civil manner instead of punishing them then school would be more enjoyable, this is more emphasized for parents of different origins (there is a common stigma that Asian parents are very strict).

In addition, the conditions for school don't really promote a healthy educational environment, which can be underlying factors to poor grades, not just student work. For example, bullying, early wake up time (not enough sleep, not always the school's fault), and long lectures. I think school should be more hands-on and students should be interacting with the world in flesh (museums, natural places, libraries), not just with the textbook. Also we should utilize modern technology more often (LCD projectors, computers, online interaction) to make the learning experience more convenient.

Although this system has been used for a while to track student progress, the competition for good grades taints the learning experience. People should know what they're studying and why they're studying it. There should be a motivation in the classroom. The only reason that people study in school is just to do better in the exam, instead we should study with passion and the good grades will come on it's own.

Don't get me wrong school is important, and you should do your best to achieve great scores. But what I'm saying is that it's not the end of the world with one F or a D. People take these things religiously and define themselves by it (I got an F on the test, I'm a complete failure/ I got an A on this test, I will become a doctor). It's really not the end of the world, but on the other hand, you really need to be aware of them because they are necessary. I'm currently a high school junior (11th grade) and I have 4 C's and a D. I never beat myself up about it, instead I've been putting more effort, participating in the class and focusing on my accomplishments.

 If you're a student of any academic level with poor grades, try to work hard and know that it won't matter 10 years from now. If your parents are concerned about your grades, just know that they are concerned about you as a person. Show them you're a strong student by being passionate about what you are doing, not just because it's an assignment. Go beyond the classroom by watching videos online and talking to like minded people about the subject. Albert Einstein once said ""Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think."" All that matters is the experience and the memories you had while you were in school. That's what sticks with you for the rest of your life.",25,1585676919,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fshj70/school_grades_are_not_really_a_big_deal/,unpopularopinion,2

fshgbm,thewoodsare,"Combining finances in a committed, healthy relationship is preferable.","This is all assuming that the partners in the relationship are committed long term, that neither partner has a shopping addiction/habit, and that the couple has talked about how they would divide finances in the event of a break-up (this could take the form of a contract).

1. It makes paying the bills so much easier. Instead of having to decide who pays which bills or doing math to split bills every month, the bills can come out of one joint account every month on auto draft. No more arguments like, 'I pay for groceries so when he/she eats more groceries than me it's unfair'.
2. It makes the process of buying new things for the house easier. One bank account to check to see how much money YOU BOTH have to spend on a new couch, TV, ect. Having these purchases come out of a joint account also influences you both to compromise on the items since it is joint money and not just his/her money. Therefore, both parties will be happy with the furniture choices and such since they both had an input in them, instead of just one person decorating for their own tastes. 
3. It makes buying things individually more harmonious, like, 'I would like to buy more clothes for myself, but he/she needs them more, so we will get them new clothes first'. Basically, having your finances combined makes you look at what the household and everyone in it needs as a whole, instead of just thinking about your own wants/needs. It leads to a more team-like mindset.
4. It leads to more saving. For people that don't have a shopping addiction/habit, it's exciting to see your finances grow because it makes you want to save more and more, not spend all that you have. Seeing the combined finances in the bank account is exciting and makes you feel richer than you would on your own. Also the fact that both partners have access to the account leads to accountability. It's not like you can't spend money, but it does make you think twice about spending money on stupid things, knowing that your partner will see it.

I believe this is unpopular because most people I have talked to are very against this. They say things like, 'What if they decide to leave you one day and take all the money out of the account?' 1. If you're not very confident that your partner wouldn't do this, don't chance it. I recommend this for healthy, long-term relationship only. And again, if you're worried about it you could always sign a contract, or even have a joint account with your partner, but then also have a backup account on the side.",5,1585676663,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fshgbm/combining_finances_in_a_committed_healthy/,unpopularopinion,4

If you are going to take women's right to an abortion at least abide the standard you set &amp; make it a 2 way street.

Is it a person or not? Either way, expecting moms could use the money or bodily autonomy.

fsh4os,peachesandthevoid,Grits; they're whats for dinner,"Grits. What comes to mind?

Unless you are a Southerner, you are probably visualizing plain white, cooked-in-water, unseasoned Quakers grits. You may have tried them at a continental breakfast as a kid, or maybe as a half-assed side at a soul food restaurant. They either tasted bland and vaguely remind you of your parents, or they just tasted bland.

You technically ate grits. You did not experience *grits*. I will revisit this after a brief analogy.

Suspend your humanity for a moment. Imagine yourself cooking spaghetti with these two (and only these two) ingredients: tomato paste and spaghetti noodles. Would this abomination be a fair representation of *spaghetti*? Is the all-encompassing canned tomato flavor an end, by itself? I do not know where ""gruel"" ends and spaghetti begins. Somewhere between basil, and meaty fats cooked into the sauce? Or maybe salt, garlic and mushrooms are the most essential elements. Not sure. I do not cook spaghetti enough.

Back to grits (also known as polenta in some circles).

The grits I mentioned above are good for the survival bunker. *Grits,* when true to platonic form, are a different culinary experience entirely. They may be cooked in chicken stock, with dashes of onion, garlic, frozen leftover bacon grease, butter, red pepper flakes, parmesan, and sharp cheddar. You can probably envision the flavor. You are wrong, it tastes better than that.

One can use all sorts of ingredients, including but not limited to lard, shrimp, jalapenos, leeks, red onions or tomatoes. Grits - as only the best comfort foods do - act as a medium for spicy, salty, and fatty flavors. Eat them with pulled pork. With eggs. Throw bits of sausage in. Do whatever the hell you want\*.  

You know that scene in that one old alien movie where they sculpt a mashed-potato mountain? You could try to do that with grits. It probably would not work, but it could be fun for an hour or so.

Vegan grits are great. They are cheap. Children and old people like grits (you don't need teeth for grits). Grits are sustainable, probably (maybe?). You can eat them at any time of the day. I like mine on winter evenings, but morning grits give you sustainable (and wholesome rural American energy) all day.

Life is short, and although it might be a bit shorter if you regularly eat buttery grits, it is small price to pay for excellence.

\*Sweet grits are absolutely disgusting. That's what oatmeal is for, weirdos.

I was scrolling through comments on an AskReddit question about what we hate about reddit. I saw a bunch of different things like someone saying ""The hate women get"" And they're downvoted, but if someone says ""The hate men get"" They're upvoted. Any left viewpoint I saw was downvoted, and right viewpoint was upvoted. The hive mentality here is insane, where someone could say something that's actually correct but if it doesn't go along with your own opinion? Downvote. Or in some subs certain views are quarantined because moderators dont agree, like in r/politics

Or in subs like AmITheAsshole or relationshipadvice there are so many people who clearly don't know how to problem solve and as soon as there is a single issue that can't be resolved immediately, you're told to break up with them or cut them off. Then these people listen to this advice.

fsgyla,kevin3874,"True equality includes EVERYONE, not just when you feel like it","I am a firm believer in standing for what you believe. If you believe a certain religion or idea, then I believe that you should stand by that idea, and not flip flop or change ideas when it benefits you. For the people who say they are for ""100% equality"", I believe that they should stand by that statement. If they truly believe that all people should be treated equal, then they should stand by that statement. But what ticks me off and really makes me question them is when they don't stand by that statement. I personally DO NOT believe in equality, and personally don't agree with men and women being equal. 

Here's what I mean:

\- If this world were to be 100% equal, then all pay should be equal. No one should be paid more than another, because that would be unfair.

\- Disabled people, children, and elderly people should be eligible to be drafted into the army. 

\- Poor people and rich people should pay the same amount for taxes.

\- Job opportunities should be random, as that would be the most fair.

Now, obviously these are extreme examples, and I know it is. I understand that the sentiment behind wanting ""true equality"" boils down to people wanting everyone to be treated well, no matter their background. However, if you say you want ""equality for all"", then you should also stand by those aforementioned circumstances. What I really think people want is equity - that everyone has the same playing field and opportunity to succeed. 

However, the problem with that is that nothing is fair. There will always be people born at a disadvantage, and there's nothing we can do about it. Even when it comes to men and women - they should not be treated equally. Some women are good at some things that men are not good at, and vice versa. WNBA players should not be paid the same as NBA players, and that's not because they are women. It's because people tend to find the NBA more entertaining, and so the amount of people watching it will naturally be higher. We don't need to force women to do things like become engineers or do ""traditional guy jobs"", if they do not want to. 

Instead of trying to make everyone be ""equal"", we should be celebrating our differences, and seeing how we can use everyone's strengths to the best of their abilities. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is just my thoughts.

\*\*\*\*No,  I don't think one gender is better, or that one race is better, or whatever. I just think we should recognize our differences and make the best of our strengths :)",10,1585675109,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsgyla/true_equality_includes_everyone_not_just_when_you/,unpopularopinion,6

Everyone on that list has been caught for doping except for Usain bolt. Since he is so wealthy, he can probably afford a drug that can evade drug tests or he has the power to bribe officials.

Also, Usain Bolt is way too muscular at 6 5 to be natural. After he turned 18, he somehow made a big improvement in his 100m time

fsgs7q,ember103,Having children is a lazy way for some people to feel accomplished,"Now, before you get angry at the title I'd like to clarify a few things. Firstly, people have should live the way they want to live. If someone is happy living a simple life, having kids, being a stay-at-home mom/dad, it's their business. I completely respect parents and feel that they have the right to be proud of having kids. However, even though childbirth is horribly painful and women are amazing for what they endure... it's no substitute for developing an interest or mastering a skill. I have a difficult time applauding something that we instinctually do in the same way that I respect someone who put an immense amount of effort toward being a beneficial member of society (scientists, artists, technicians,  plumbers, teachers...just be good at something!).

I've noticed that there is a pretty large community of  women who make motherhood their entire identity. Like, they gatekeep pregnancy (""oh, you had a c-section??"") And shame mothers who had an epidural, child-free women, women who can't conceive, etc and it's honestly so bizarre to me. No one else gives a shit. It's a piss-poor attitude to have, and focusing so much on the way you birthed your kid just seems like a lazy way to feel accomplished. 

I genuinely love hearing different opinions, so if you disagree I want to hear your stance. If you agree, that's great too.

fsgnwr,EyeDontArgueOnline,"People lamenting on reddit about ""dark"" content in mainstream movies have been coddled to the point where they are incapable of dealing with hardship of the real world.","This won't be popular but I'm blown away by how sheltered a lot of people are on this site. I get it, not everybody is special forces veteran or whatever, but I regularly see posts where people are lamenting about how they were pushed to their limits by some of the most inane things like a ""dark"" cartoon they saw on Disney or something. Every time I use this site, I encounter some doe-eyed candyass  posting in shock and horror about about some mainstream, censored superhero movie made them lose faith in humanity or how they went on the internet once, read  offensive, and they had to unplug for 9 months to regain sanity.

**Newsflash** : If it's hosted on a mainstream site like youtube or it was played in a theater, it's not that fucking extreme. People self-diagnosing or trying to adopt victim identities that somehow mean they experienced that episode of the Simpsons where Bart runs away on **that much more ""dark"" of a dark level for them because they have xyz disorder** further reinforces that these people haven't experienced any actual hardship and have been coddled to the point where they will be incapable of dealing with the real world. 

I have worked with real victims of PTSD. Most of their triggers are benign things like helicopters or fireworks. They doing go around broadcasting to the world about they couldn't handle *The Dark Night* or some senseless blood and guts movie -- they just simply don't watch those things  because they are actually survivors of traumatic events and do not need to subject themselves to such content. They don't advertise online for fake internet points and revel in their own weakness or victimhood identity. After working with these guys, I lost basically all sympathy for these suburban keyboard warriors who never experienced real trauma so they play-act like they can adopt imaginary trauma from TV into their real life. 

*""Oh, but what about* \[insert movie here\]! *They did something so realistic that people actually tried to report them for it!""*

People also tried to report Gilligan's Island when it first aired in the 1960s because they thought it was real. That doesn't mean the content was extreme. It means people are fucking morons and largely insulated from violence to a point where they cannot separate fantasy from reality.

*""Oh, but sometimes moderators miss things! I saw a video of \[*insert graphic violent here*\] that wasn't censored yet! I'm traumatized by it!""*

The difference between you and the people in those videos you watched is that you sat your bubble-yum ass on your couch and watched it from the comfort of your own home without stopping it while the people in the video actually experienced those traumatic events firsthand and now live with the consequences of them -- if they're even alive at all. By all means, being disturbed by disturbing content is a sign that your brain is working correctly. Not being disturbed by disturbing content doesn't make you billy badass either. But flailing about like your life is ruined by a video you watched is pathetic. Unless you're a content moderator and being forced to watch that stuff 8 hours a day for 40 hours a week, youtube's content moderation is not so poor that you're being exposed to a lot of it.   

The reality is that people die everyday in car accidents, illness, war, murder, and all sorts of tragedies. These tragedies are real. You or someone you love will likely experience one of them. Exposing yourself to disturbing content online or in movies will not help you prepare for them because, unlike the shows you watch, what makes these events tragic is that the people involved are permanently affected by them in very serious ways. What's more, if you cannot handle the content in movies, you will be woefully unprepared for when they happen in real life -- at which point you will have real problems.",8,1585674163,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsgnwr/people_lamenting_on_reddit_about_dark_content_in/,unpopularopinion,5

fsgmmr,Mercurial_Rhombus,People should stop using the terms 'overrated' and 'underrated'.,"I've noticed that it's become very common for people to call things 'overrated'/'underrated' because they dislike something a lot of people like and know/like something a lot of people don't like or know. I find people who use these terms very irritating because 1) they are suggesting that the general opinion to the thing they are describing is inaccurate and their opinion is the right one, and 2) it is often evident that they think of themselves as cultured and discerning because they have these opinions. Both scream 'superiority complex'.

Most things are subjective and opinions/preferences cannot be right or wrong. (Beliefs, which are a completely different thing, can be.) If you dislike something that most people like, that doesn't mean that you're enlightened and the people who like it are conformist sheep. If you like something that most people don't like or haven't heard of, that doesn't mean that you're special and the other people are ignorant and uncultured. All it means is that you have an unpopular opinion, and there is no reason to feel as though you're above everyone else because of it. Also, there are always reasons why things are popular/unpopular.

Instead of saying 'X is overrated' or 'Y is underrated', just say that you don't like X or you like Y. Everyone has their reasons for liking or disliking things and yours are no better than anyone else's.",3,1585674064,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsgmmr/people_should_stop_using_the_terms_overrated_and/,unpopularopinion,0

That well all be able to live happily with 9, 10, or even 15+ billion human beings? Plus all the animals, if any of them besides farm animals are even alive by then. 

Honestly, this whole system is set up to fail at some point very soon. Look at the incompetence of the worlds governments at containing and ending this virus fiasco.

And of course after this nothing will change. Sure maybe the government's will spend maybe an extra 1 or 2 billion on medical organizations and the like. However, what next? They're still going to ignore things like global warming, pollution, global economic inequality, terrorism, wars(or perhaps I should put ""wars""), nuclear threats, overpopulation, loss of fossil fuels, etc. 

I mean, wat are we going to do when we run out of oil and coal? The world literally runs on that shit. Once the poor people of china cant afford to get solar panels on their roof, there goes their electricity and means of transportation. 

Then suddenly there goes cheap labor. There goes your fancy devices, hell, there goes anything of reasonable value. The world literally runs off of cheap chinese labor. 

Look at places like india, china, and Africa. Extreme poverty and overpopulation(at least in india) has led to diseases to spread like wildfire. A lack of any education and sanitation doesnt help. 

Those places are run purely by fossil fuels. You dont see protesters pressuring their government officials to use renewable energies do you? No, the ones that do are all shot dead or sent to camps to be murdered in some of the worst ways imaginable. I think Hong kong has proven to us how effective even trying would be anyway.

Maybe I'm just a pessimist that doesnt understand or know enough about the world to have a different opinion, but from what I can gather,

we're fucked.

You can have achievements that are easy, but just don’t make them grindy. 5 times is reasonable for easy tasks that require little effort. Anything grindy should be reserved for a challenge that rewards the player with an item or skin. Challenges can be as grindy as needed. Achievements? They shouldn’t make you dislike the game you’re playing out of pure boredom.

Edit: People seem to be misinterpreting my post. I never meant to say achievements shouldn’t be difficult or nearly impossible to complete. I love playing games on hardcore difficulty with extra handicaps imposed if I like. I don’t like doing the same thing the same way a hundred times just to be able to say I got the achievement. Lots of multiplayer games do this. You have to do X 100, 200, or even 500 times, which amounts to either just playing the game normally a lot or setting up a scenario that doesn’t normally happen, 500 times. Who thought that would be fun or exciting?

I'm not going to eat cupcakes without frosting every day for breakfast, but I would with a muffin. Also, frosting on the cake is just always so... nasty to me. Like I've seen videos where people dunk huge amounts of frosting on a cake and I just feel so sick whenever I see that much sweetness inside a food item. I don't normally like eating cake on my birthdays, I normally use choco-pies because they are such a better alternative to an overpriced cake that has 60/40 ratio of frosting to the cake which just would feel like all I'm putting into my mouth is whipped cream that is far too sweet.

I know some people do it to be popular or look cool. However spending loads on a pair of jeans or shoes etc. is stupid when you can buy cheaper shoes etc. for less for the same quality.

fsgbeb,GreattaDiodeNode,YouTube doesn't deserve most of the hate it gets.,"This is gonna be a bit long and also sorry for any mistakes, I'm writing this from a mobile. 


Lately, It's became a trend to just shit on YouTube. Every single YouTuber does nothing but goes on this rants on how YouTube is pile of hot garbage. 

For me, as a consume, it's one of the greatest fucking thing to be ever made. I don't face any problems when using YouTube. It has a fucking great algorithm which suggests me content which I like based on my watch history, works like a charm. I can just go their search for something I wanna learn and boom, millions of tutorial are here for free. Need a cooking recipie? You got it. Wanna watch news? Here you go, official news channels. Just wanna see something cool? We got it covered. I've never came across a single friend or family or relative who hates YouTube, they actually love it. People hate when youtube puts videos like Americans got talent or X factor but you know what? Most of the casual users actually like that kind of content. People forget that other people exist who might like this type of content. Just because you don't like it or watch it doesn't mean others don't like it, my auntie absolutely loves YouTube because she can watch acts of Americas got talent anytime. It's not YouTube's fault for recommending it, it's what majority of people wanna watch. 

People say there is a lot of cringey content out there on YouTube and YouTube doesn't do anything to fix it. Why should they? There are people who like it, I too find this content garbage but what's the problem if someone genuinely enjoys watching it? Who am I to say what others want to watch? If someone wants to watch Jake Paul? Let them watch him if the like it. Everyone has preference. 

About algorithm, it does what it is supposed to do, suggest me content based on what I like and watch and I never find it suggesting me stuff that I don't wanna watch. Also the stuff with ads, people should stop complaining about ads. YouTube is free of charge, you don't have to pay a penny out of your pocket to watch YouTube? How are they supposed to make money if they can't show ads? And people who say just use adblock on YT are just assholes. People really shit hard on YouTube for ads but then ask them to pay their content creators fairly? How the fuck are they supposed to pay them if they can't show ads? YouTube isn't a profitable business, it's only afloat because Google pours billions of dollars in it, nothing can compete with YT, it basically handles Peta bytes of data everyday and it requires servers which require money to operate. YouTube's infrastructure is way too complex. Just be glad that something like YouTube exists. If you hate ads so much then buy the YT premium subscription, it costs like $1.5 (atleast in my country), and you get YouTube Music too  

Everyone complains how YouTube isn't a community anymore and doesn't care about it's creator. How are they supposed to address each and every problem by the users? There are like two billon people using the sites and it spans across 100s of different countries. YouTube just can't satisfy everyone. It is just way too big. There are creators from America, England, Australia, India, Japan and many more countries and everyone will never be satisfied no matter what YouTube does. And most of the casual users don't really care about problems, they see it as a social media or entertainment site. 

And the thing about YouTube just wants to earn money? Uhh.. what's wrong with that? It's a business. It supports millions of creators and they need to make money. Many creators say YouTube isn't the old YouTube anymore, but then say they'll something like, I'm getting demonitized and can't make money so I gotta shut down my channel. Well for your information, YouTube wasn't made for earning money either, it was to share videos. People didn't upload videos to earn money but to show everyone their videos. It doesn't make sense for creators to say YouTube is becoming corporate but then say that it isn't making money so they can't continue. YouTube isn't your fucking job, it's not a career. It never was and stop thinking that just because you make YouTube videos you are entitled to get money. Isn't it funny that people will complain about YouTube making money while doing the same thing? YouTube is a side thing, YouTubers like SomeOrdinaryGamer, he has a day job and does YouTube as a side thing. Penguinz0, does streams for income and YouTube as a side thing and used to donate all of YT revenue to charity. If you want YouTube just to make money then you aren't any different. 

People need to understand that YouTube is too big to fix all the problems. Each minute hundred and thousands of minutes of content is uploaded and it can't be monitored by a human. Hundred of thousands of videos are reported or claimed and YouTube really can't do much about it, no one has manpower to deal with this that's why A.I. is used to deal with it. I agree that it isn't always right but it's not humanely possible to review everything manually. I won't deny it's problems with copy right claims and YouTube seriously needs to fix it. YouTube can't really satisfy Consumers, Creators and advertisers. But that shouldn't be any reason to ignore the problems. But other than that, YouTube is really fucking great.",3,1585673064,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsgbeb/youtube_doesnt_deserve_most_of_the_hate_it_gets/,unpopularopinion,4

fsgb0n,Larsnonymous,Video games don’t teach problem solving skills and aren’t a good use of time.,"I hear gamers all the time say that video games are a good use of time and that they teach problem solving skills and are somehow as good as sports and other team activities. This is bullshit. Games are designed for one thing only - to get you to spend money. They manipulate your brain in the same way Facebook and Instagram do to get you to spend more time and more money on them.  They don’t teach anything and no one has ever thanked gaming for their success in life (except a small number of professional gamers) Any good they do for the average Joe is washed out by the harm they do (low physical activity, low human interaction). I’m not saying games are bad, just don’t try to sell me the bullshit line that they are somehow productive. They are just entertainment.  It reminds of the potheads that promote weed as some kind of healthy thing. Just call it what it is and be ok with that. People smoke weed because it’s fun to get high.

fsg5hs,datdude1229,"Giving money to homeless beggars and panhandlers is not a ""good"" or ""helpful"" act.","
Giving money to those who are standing at an intersection with a cardboard sign or holding a bucket is actually a net negative. In the long run you are hurting yourself and that person. 

Giving them money hurts your bank account and enables their behaviour and lifestyle. Given they are now getting rewarded for standing out there rather than making other more beneficial actions for their life. They also will generally use this money on harmful substances and addictions that may have led them to this point in their life. 

The best alternative is to buy them some food, give them a blanket and or other basic necessities. Though it is surprising how many won't be grateful or even care about those things though given they want money to make damaging purchases.

There are exceptions. I'm sure a few of them are just in a bad spot, but those are not the rule. And mental illness is also rampant in the homeless community, which also complicates things.

She’s good at saying her lines with different emotions but it’s just not believable to me. It just looks like she’s pretending to be someone else, which is what actors do, but with good ones you don’t notice it. I can’t even remember many of her characters names because she’s always just been Meryl Streep to me.

fsfw90,proserpinaofspring,Elsa and Moana are intended to teach the same lesson...Elsa teaches it way better (spoilers),"Okay, hear me out. Back before Frozen 2 came out I though Moana was an amazing movie with a great message and I thought Frozen was just okay. I didn’t like Ana because she was annoying and I didn’t like Elsa because she was a bitch. When I saw frozen 2, I started to think critically about Moana and my mind changed completely. 

Throughout Elsa’s arc (across frozen 1 &amp; 2) and Moana’s arc (across her one movie) there are a lot of similarities between the two characters. They are both gifted with powers at a young age that make it difficult for them to fulfill their predetermined destiny: ruling their respective kingdoms when they come of age. This makes them outcasts of society and resentful of the role that was picked out for them. They rebel, hurt themselves in the process, and resign themselves to ruling their kingdoms. Then something bad happens and they need to use their powers to save their people. In the end, they get to live the life they want to while keeping their kingdom safe. 

Now, there’s nothing wrong with them being very similar characters. But throughout these journeys, they have a “why me” mentality that makes them desperately search for their purpose.


Moana finds out “why her” through her grandma. The grandma tells her that their people used to be voyagers and that’s why Moana feels so compelled to voyage. Her “purpose” is to save the island and get her people voyaging again. 

Elsa finds out “why her” during the song “show yourself” which is what ultimately changed my mind. She learns she doesn’t need someone to tell her why she is the way she is because the answer is inside her and has been all along. She doesn’t need outside validation for the way she feels and her “purpose” is to literally just to live the life she wants to. Yes, she technically was born to unite the two groups of people but her existence is enough. She is enough. 

This is the main difference between the two. Choice. Moana is resentful of the role her family has chosen for her (ruling the island) and her arc ends when she fulfills...another predetermined familial role? She doesn’t choose this, she just happens to like the new role (voyaging) chosen for her more than the other one. She’s technically presented with a bogus “choice” in the emotional scene where her grandma says “you can go home if you want” while she’s on her journey. Well, that’s not really a choice because if she goes home her entire civilization will die out. 

Elsa is given the information about her past and why she was born. She was never told she *had* to do anything and she learns that she doesn’t have to live her life for other people because she happened to be born a monarch. She moves away from the kingdom and makes Ana the new queen and everyone lives happily ever after. 

Moana is given no choice but to rule her kingdom. She doesn’t want to. She is then given no choice but to voyage. She wants to. And everyone lives happily ever after because she was given a role she’s complacent with. 

I’m genuinely interested in other people’s thoughts on this. Because after Frozen 2, the message of Moana has rubbed me the wrong way.",4,1585671702,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsfw90/elsa_and_moana_are_intended_to_teach_the_same/,unpopularopinion,3

Now that doesn't make it bad, the visuals look fine and work perfectly for the simple game that it is, I wouldn't want it to be incredibly realistic or anything though I'd compare this game in terms of graphics and play style to indie games such as Stardew Valley and Minecraft, which charge only around $10-20, this game is a shit ton more then that.

These games are really fucking cheap to make and they're selling it for the equivalent of games with life like graphics and giant vast landscapes, it's ridiculous. Nintendo charging full price is basically just the Apple tax but for nintendo because they know people would eat it up and everyone I ask thinks it's fine because ""It's a good game"". 

Same goes for them selling a 2012 game which is a cheap to make platformer (new super mario bros u) then adding the word deluxe on it and selling it on the next gen console full price, with it selling for around 60 dollars 8 years after release.

Personally, homemade vanilla is the best ice cream in the world, and if I could only eat one Ice cream flavor for the rest of my life, it would be vanilla. 

  I also think that vanilla is the best flavor because it's so agreeable. Few people can say that they don't like vanilla, so if you could only have one flavor of ice cream at a party, you would probably choose vanilla too.

To sum it up; I like the flavor of vanilla and I like the fact that it is almost universally a ""good"" choice (unlike so many other flavors)",23,1585671200,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsfqm8/vanilla_is_the_best_ice_cream_flavor/,unpopularopinion,26

fsfnz7,TrulyStupidNewb,Raising prices on non-essential items is completely justified in the current crisis,"Right now, there are tons of threads complaining how companies are ""price gouging"" on non-essential items by doubling their prices. For example, Dell is doubling the price of some of their high-end products.

However, I personally believe that increasing prices in times of crisis is reasonable if the cost of production is higher or the profitability lower.

Let's face it, costs to produce items will be higher. Many of the factories that produce the required parts required might close or slow down production. Then, shipping is also affected because of the crisis. Some workers might not show up due to personal or government decision or request higher pay.

The people who demand that everyone produce the same products at the same price rain or shine are on par with those stereotypical clueless CEOs who expect too much of their employees. They expect people to work as efficiently and at the same price in any condition.

This is because many people take so many services for granted. Did you know that 4k monitors used to be much more expensive, but they went down in price. In fact, 4K monitors wasn't available for most of human history (19th century, for example), and yet now that we've enjoyed cheaper 4K monitors for a few years, thousands of people are so entitled that we're ready to throw people in prison for temporarily reverting the price of 4K monitors to the same price as a few years ago?

If we expect the same price for items during a pandemic, Dell might as well suspend all operations and not sell any monitors, because they clearly won't be able to produce monitors at the same quantity and profit with all the problems in the world today. If they don't produce monitors, then there's no work, and thousands of workers will be at home twiddling their thumbs and not getting paid, worried about the rent, and might lose their home.

If it costs more to make, companies deserve to raise the price. We should be grateful that some people are willing to manufacture 4k gaming monitors with low latency and sell and ship them in a crisis time like this. Now is not the time to throw monitor manufacturers in jail but rather to thank them for staying open for business.",20,1585670962,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsfnz7/raising_prices_on_nonessential_items_is/,unpopularopinion,1

In fact lookism is the only form of universal discrimination that affects all people regardless of race, age or gender.

Now this isn't to say success is guaranteed by any means, just that there is a strong correlation between certain elements of success and conventional attractiveness in the western sense.

Discrimination on the basis of looks transcends racial boundaries and is the main form of discrimination in the western world.

fsfla6,CornyPornyAccount,"Porn Sites should be forced to have a ""Fap Responsibily"" disclaimer and access to legitimate Porn Addiction resources at the very least.","Porn is a drug and is open to abuse. You can deny it of you want, but the fact of the matter is that it provides a short-lived dopamine rush in exchange for a fantasy. Alcohol, Tobacco and Gambling have government-mandated disclaimers and resources, why not Porn?

Now I'm in no way saying it should be banned, but it is frankly jaw-dropping when you really stop and think about how much they can get away with. The ONLY barrier is a single button (usually surrounded by suggestive images) that anyone can click. It's accessible from any device that can connect to internet, and is fully ingrained into today's culture. Swap out watching porn for drinking and it sounds a whole lot worse when someone says they've been doing it every day since they were 14.

I've grown up with it being a normal thing to watch since being a PRE-TEEN. Right when someone's coming to terms with their sexuality and what is to be expected and you have a HUGE access to unrealistic expectations with no sign of it being out of place or unhealthy to over-indulge in. 

Porn companies are able to create unhealthy habits for people that people will only realise they have years late and claim no responsibility for their actions. While not as drastic as other substance abuse effects, side effects of porn addiction can include:

Less pleasure sexually and in general due to dopamine tolerance buildup
Extreme guilt/shame/Insecurities/feelings of powerlessness
Trouble building meaningful emotional relationships
Overspending of time/money on Porn
And ED among many other things.

Not to mention the thought of porn addiction being a real thing is still a joke to many people. If porn sites were to have a warning sign and disclaimer, it would at least normalise the problem for people and make it easier to get help.

Masturbation is a perfectly normal act with health benefits when done in moderation, and watching porn to unwind is no different to smoking a bowl or having a glass of wine to relax. But it is time for the porn industry to claim responsibility that it CAN be harmful and have a negative impact.

How dare we make people learn anything new (like how to use a computer properly for remote work) and instead we have companies skirting the ""shelter-in-place"" mandates of the state that I live in because...you can't make cold calls at home??? Your sales job is ""that"" essential that you don't need to be off the roads, away from your coworkers who have to complete manual labor in essential industries, and generally be a horse's ass while you whine that your parents fought two wars and wha-wha-wha ""why are they closing the restaurants...I have a lunch date""?

Within 2 days of the order, the entire city had basically gone home. City services are still functioning with reduced on-site staff, remote workers are working, stores are still running, but everyone else can stay the fuck home. And you know what? The roads are empty. There are fewer car crashes. How many millions would that save every year? There's less money being spent on foreign oil. Not a bad thing IMO, especially since I don't have to pay for it, or extra maintenance on the car. The skies are finally fucking clearing up. Commuting is a waste of man hours and a waste of your life. Give people some breathing space. We wouldn't need to be spending trillions widening roads and building more infrastructure and could instead put that money towards education or some other shit that people bitch about not having enough money for.

There's enough fucking money. It's just we spend it on stuff we don't need. We don't want to insist that people become more efficient, or use things that will last longer. On BOTH sides of the fucking aisle, we don't even want to believe that it's the people who need taxes frozen and advance payment, before we consider bailing out companies who have assets up the wazoo to leverage and mortgage for themselves. We are forced to operate in a global climate but we don't want to hold other people accountable for their end of that. We don't want to insist that we leave something behind for the next group that isn't absolute crap, or organized in such a way as to not totally fry them and leave them drained and exhausted by the time they are 40.

Everyone who pointed out the flaws in his thinking was downvoted. 
The downvoted comments pointed out things like “it’s a game, pause and talk to her” or “ignore the phone and call her back when the games done, but don’t raise your voice”. 

On political or debate subs, you have the downvoted trolls and the upvoted popular opinions. Near the bottom you have the downvoted opinions where there’s a lot of decent people willing to debate and discuss views and opinions and so on.

fsffhx,sweettapioca,I’m sick of Women’s interests being viewed as stupid,"Honestly I used to buy into a lot of this too, even from a young age. Once I reached around 2nd grade, almost every girl I knew had to pretend they hated pink just so they wouldn’t be viewed as “girly.” Then, as I grew a little older, I would constantly see how media directed toward teenage girls was constantly being made fun of. “Chick flicks,” makeup, and things like that basically had zero respect from anyone. On social media, I would constantly see girls trying to set themselves apart from “other girls” by hating on girly things like crop tops and jewelry. It makes me so angry that people who indulge in “girly” things won’t be as respected as girls who don’t, and that things that men usually enjoy are always seen as better taste. I hate that. I hate that boys have to pretend that they hate girly shows and movies. I hate that girls have to reject everything that’s marketed toward females to feel like they even have a personality. And even so, if they stray too far off the path, people just accuse them of doing it for male approval. The amount of girls that are into gaming, comics, and anime still being shot down even when they’re genuinely interested in these subjects is just appalling. “Girly” things require talent and taste too. They aren’t just shallow and stupid like most people want to believe.",384,1585670221,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsffhx/im_sick_of_womens_interests_being_viewed_as_stupid/,unpopularopinion,35

Somethings are mainstream because they're actually good shows worth watching or great singers. I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift or Katy Perry, but there's nothing wrong with people who are.

Some say that without work/school they don't know what to do all day. To me it seems alarming that we got so used to spend 6-10 hours of each day working/learning that we can't fill that time doing something relaxing or entertaining in our own homes. 

I just don't understand how you can get bored when given whole days to yourself. Read something, watch something, play something. Thanks to the internet we have acces to an unlimited source of content for all tastes. 
Talk to your relatives via call or videocall, try cooking something new, catch up with old friends and check up on older acquaintances. Spend time with your family if you live with them, spend hours on phone with them if you're alone. Talk to your friends, make sure they're ok.

fsevix,PsychologicalGlass1,Math is fun.,"Granted, you do need a bunch of things to help make math fun. Without a patient teacher, a willingness to spend time, and an understanding for its importance, I can understand why many people dread the subject.

However, math to me is by far the most important and applicable subject that we learn in school (science could be argued, although many sciences like chemistry and physics use plenty of math themselves), and it’s an integral part of nearly every field. Excluding mathematicians and scientists, historians use math to carbon date things, real estate agents use math to determine prices, farmers calculate yields and divide up their land, bankers basically only use math... in fact, I think it would be hard to name a single profession that never uses any math.

But my point isn’t that math is important, it’s that it’s fun. You can’t tell me that you were never satisfied after finishing a geometry proof, or effectively using the quadratic formula, or finding an integral (idk if that’s a thing, I’m not in calc yet), or transforming a word problem into an equation and solving it, ESPECIALLY when you keep everything organized.  To me, the thought that a solid knowledge of mathematics can solve so many real world problems makes it extremely satisfying and appealing.

fseqre,Lionfranky,"If you say ""you can play xbox games on pc,"" yet play multiplatform on playstation, you are a hypocrite.","""Xbox has no exclusive because you can play the games on pc.""

""Why buy it on Xbox?"" 

First, there is difference between Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. There are games that are on Xbox Game Pass but not on PC Game Pass. Ex) Kingdom Hearts 3. This is great service that's often overlooked. I got to try games that I never thought giving try. 

Second, people act like almost everyone owns mid~high end PC. No. According to Steam chart, most players own PCs that are less powerful than current consoles. Next Xbox is fantastic deal in one package. Try to set up PC that is just as powerful as next Xbox. You will find the graphic card alone far exceeding in price. Not to mention, consoles are specifically customed and tailored to work for games. Xbox series X is more on this line. Many multiplatform titles generally sell more on consoles (Of course, I am aware of exceptions.) especially on PS4. So why don't they play those multiplatform titles on PC? 

Third, consoles tend to be more stable due to unifying structure. 

I played PS4 exclusives like Horizon Zero Dawn, Persona 5, God of War, Last of Us remastered. They are all great titles, but after those, I haven't turned on my PS4 much. Maybe, when next titles like Last of Us 2 releases, I will get back. But for now, I stick to my Xbox.",8,1585667958,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fseqre/if_you_say_you_can_play_xbox_games_on_pc_yet_play/,unpopularopinion,1

fse4e5,maxanor,I like working in an office setting,"I have been working from home for the past two weeks, and I legitimately don't like it. I work in building design and working in an office is so much easier.

If I have a question I can easily ask several co-workers, especially since several of them have 3 decades of experience in the industry. Working from home I usually have to wait 30min for an answer, and then it might not be as in depth as I would like. I also miss being able to print out large plans (22x17 &amp; up).

I also find it easier to concentrate once I leave my apartment. I like having that clear separation between work and home. Home is where I should be relaxing &amp; doing hobbies.

I enjoy leaving my house during the week &amp; talking to co-workers and getting to know them. It's hard to establish that working remotely.

Also I've been wondering if everyone starts working home what does that mean for training in new hires? I would hate to have to learn all these skills remotely.

It’s no surprise that a lot of them are willing to cover up or ignore evil things occurring on their force among their own ranks for the sake of unity. 

Lawyers get a bum rap however, people think they’re untrustworthy because they make money off of misery and they try to free guilty people. But the fact that American society is structured around providing everyone at least the ability to plead their case makes the American legal system one of the best on Earth.

fsdwn6,nikomek_rouhnayek,There is nothing noble about joining the army,"

First off this is mainly aimed at European and North American nations. Look you aren't 'fighting for your country', you're fighting and dying for corporate greed, twisted foreign policy and coward politicians who are more than happy to use someone else's kids as cannon fodder, literally. I'm not a 'sheltered civvie', I did my national service and defended my borders from Isis/uqba Ibn nafi/Al qaeda, I'll admit it was mainly for the adventure, money, benefits, I didn't really give a shit about the nobility or respect, and this was literally on my doorstep.

Sending your troops to die 2000 miles away is hardly defending your nation, it's imperialism, you're only pissing terrorists off even more and putting your civilians at risk from reprisals and retaliation attacks. I have nothing against soldiers, if anything I feel sorry for them as they don't decide where they go, it is cowards in suits that make that life/death decision, having said that, you aren't brave or noble for joining, you're just misguided, US/UK troops are fully aware their country was/is engaged in wars that have nothing to do with them but many still claim ""I'm just following orders"", yea like the Nazis were ""just following orders"" (I'm not comparing American and British soldiers to the Nazis btw, but the ""I'm just following orders"" notion is extremely extremely dangerous, it's exactly how genocide and atrocities happen). Afghanis, Iraqis, Malians etc DO NOT want western soldiers in their lands whether they are helping or not, they don't need the US or UK/France/Australia to fight on their behalf and it just fuels terrorism and sectarianism even more. You wanna help your nation? Stay in your country and join the public services, volunteer, educate your youth, help the homeless and poor. Killing a rural Afghani teenager with a Kalashnikov and crude explosives is hardly defending your country now is it, especially when he's probably seen half his family blown up by a coalition drone. 

Obviously USA (world police) is the worst for this, Americans are practically forced to worship their armed forces and anyone who speaks out is labelled unpatriotic or just as bad as the enemy. Moreover, there are more noble jobs (firefighters, doctors, nurses, teachers) who don't get nearly the same amount of respect as soldiers do, on top of that, being a soldier isn't even the most dangerous job, so if we are basing respect on level of danger faced in the workplace, why aren't we praising fisherman, loggers, pilots, equally? 

It's absurd and dangerous in my opinion to have such high levels of obsession with the military, respect soldiers as you would any other human being but the majority don't deserve special privileges or extra respect because their job happens to be more dangerous than the average Joe's.",94,1585665073,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsdwn6/there_is_nothing_noble_about_joining_the_army/,unpopularopinion,1

Why? Because no one knows who’s really seeing your account and might stumble upon your child’s picture and use it for something dirty.

fsdqji,ZombieBoy98,War of the Worlds 2005 was a great film,"One of the best cinematic experiences I had as a kid was when I went to see Spielberg’s War of the Worlds. I was 8 years old and I had no clue what this film was about. When I seen the tripods for the first time it blew my mind. They looked so menacing and the horn gave me nightmares. I remember a lot of great scenes from this movie that stayed with me. I would draw pictures of he tripods at school and found them so fascinating.
The ferry scene was terrifying. I was so terrified watching that as a kid especially the part where there in the water and they begin scooping people up. Also hated the basement scene when Rachel wakes up and that weird tripod camera thing is in her face. 

I decided to watch the film again and I still really enjoyed. I’ll admit the ending was forgettable and boring, I couldn’t remember what happened at the very end after all these years. If they took away the sons storyline at the end I’d give it a 10/10.  Really hated how he came back alive at the end, even as a kid. I would watch this film every other week and not get bored of it. 
 
Because of this film I read the book and wanted to see other versions of the tripod. I have seen every version and my personal favourite will always be the 2005 version of the tripods. The great Martian war ones will come in a close second. Maybe the adults that went to see them in cinema at the time didn’t like it but it left a big impression on me as a kid. I see this film get shit on a lot and everyone I ask say they didn’t like the film that much. I thought he done a great job of this film even it was rushed. The sounds the tripods make are classic imo.",5,1585664467,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsdqji/war_of_the_worlds_2005_was_a_great_film/,unpopularopinion,1

fsdlj1,bruek53,"Bullying people is bad, but having no bullying is also bad.","Bullying can lead to a lot of bad things and serious issues, but a certain level of bullying should be tolerated, as it can be useful. 

School is a place where kids learn about the world and how to function in it. From time to time, you will get kids who are just weird and have outlandish ideas about how the world works. In an environment where bullying is not tolerated, these kids are able to thrive with their misguided world view. Because of this, these kids often get a rude awakening when they reach adulthood. The world is not as they believed and this leads to its own problems.  

There are too many kids who are becoming adults that take things too seriously, can’t laugh at themself, don’t know how to deal with someone not liking them, can’t handle the world not listening to them, etc. If these kids had a little bit of bullying in their lives, this would help them learn to deal with adversity while they are young and their decisions don’t matter as much.  

Again, I’m not saying that we should encourage bullying. I’m saying that having 0 bullying makes kids have a unrealistic view of the world that a little bit of childhood adversity and conflict resolution could have fixed.",14,1585663945,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsdlj1/bullying_people_is_bad_but_having_no_bullying_is/,unpopularopinion,1
fsdlil,UncleMoustache,Deceiving your child is not acceptable.,"As a parent, it seems crazy to me that parents would want to explain away the hard work that they put in to making their children's lives better. I believe that this shocks a lot of young adults entering adulthood and just delays reality, making kids have unrealistic expectations of what adulthood really is.

The kind of things I'm talking about are the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, Tooth and other fairies, etc.

Saying that fairies rearranged their room (instead of explaining the multitude of reasonable reasons for moving furniture).

It seems to be a way for parents to selfishly defer disappointing their children. Yes, life can be hard. But life can also be beautiful and rewarding.

To be clear, there is a big difference, in my opinion, between telling the tale of the Saint Nicholas who would enter chimneys and give presents to children (which is a form of B&amp;E that would make me feel incredibly unsafe in my own home). Storytelling is completely acceptable and can provide a lot of fun and learning, as long as you don't intentionally elude reality.

fsdf6v,LongLiveTheSpoon,The ‘nice guy’ trope has lost its original meaning and is now intended to give women all the power in a relationship,"INB4 someone calls me a ‘nice guy’

The ‘nice guy’ meme had a pretty clear and inarguable meaning - guys thought they were deserved sex just for being nice/respecting women. Obviously this is wrong and nobody is ‘deserved’ sex, especially without even making their intentions clear.

Now going to the the sub you get guys lambasted for being irritated for being ghosted or for the woman not doing anything in a relationship.

Look, if you’re still chatting on the app and you’re just talking, yeah getting ghosted sucks but sometimes girls are busy (unlikely as no girl is THAT busy as to never check her apps) or has lost interest. She doesn’t wanna deal with the confrontation so she ghosts.

But I’ve had it where I’m dating a girl and she puts in literally no effort yet still INSISTS she really likes me and wants to see me. Well if she really likes me why isn’t she responding to my messages even after days? Yet I would probably be called a ‘nice guy’ for expecting ANYTHING from the girl I’m dating.

Also, It’s been almost FOUR YEARS since a woman has bought me a gift. I am ALWAYS expected to initiate, choose the place, pay for the meal/activity, and make plans for the next date. Even after dating for WEEKS she won’t even buy me a coffee let alone cook something for me etc. Am I a ‘nice guy’ for expecting ANYTHING from someone I am seeing? Some on the sub would say yes. ‘Just cause you’re being a good boyfriend doesn’t mean she HAS to do anything for you nice guy!’

I’ve very nicely cut off some women for these exact reasons, and if that makes me a ‘nice guy’, then so be it. :)",15,1585663305,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsdf6v/the_nice_guy_trope_has_lost_its_original_meaning/,unpopularopinion,1

fscywl,dasukushuraudo,"The remake of Final Fantasy VII is a public statement by Square Enix that they have peaked, and can't make better games than previous releases... but it's packaged as fan-service.","""For Final Fantasy VII Remake, the project started from my desire to make Final Fantasy VII with today’s technology while I’m still here at Square Enix."" ([source](https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-viii-remake-younger-staff/))

Well, that's completely untrue.. Originally it was [publicly stated](http://andriasang.com/con1ny/wada_on_ffvii_remake/) (original transcription [here](http://marshallalloc.blog90.fc2.com/blog-entry-880.html)) that Square would *not* do a FFVII remake until they created a game that sold more copies. The second and third bestselling Square games, Tomb Raider and FFXIV, and 2mil and 2.2mil copies short respectively.

So I counter that the project started with the desire to make more money in light of the fact that they weren't able to create a better selling game, and decided to [cash in](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSNTzGdgnDdHKECoOfyA9oHabCvzdXyMo8eY7yJOuc-zc6zcz5n) on a remake. By going back on their original statement without achieving it, they are acknowledging that they can not and will not make a better game and have given up on the idea of it ever happening. They have even split it into multiple games! They are literally selling recycled content in instalments!

I know it's an unpopular opinion, and I can understand why many people will disagree or just not care, and that's okay. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and I hope the people excited for the remake have an awesome time playing it. But I won't be financially supporting it for the reasons stated above. I'm very enthusiastic about the idea of games and the stories we grew up playing and relating to being preserved, and I really wish that there was a bigger emphasis on the importance of backwards-compatibility on consoles to prevent these stories from being lost and not necessitating piracy, but that is *not* what the FFVII remake is about. It is about squeezing out a bit more money in spite of the fact that they have given up on making better games.",3,1585661561,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fscywl/the_remake_of_final_fantasy_vii_is_a_public/,unpopularopinion,1

I think the new layout of the comment section is a step back in Reddit history. 

Before that the comments where focusing on the actual comment someone left, with the username visible but subtle.

Now the username and even the profile pic are highlighted so much that the focus shifts from content to user, which makes the Reddit comment section personal like any other social platform. Sure, it makes dialog easier to follow, but is that really necessary?

With that new layout we need an anonymous mode more that ever, so anyone can share their opinion without having to worry about people checking their account.

Also, every single living thing changes it’s environment constantly, humans are just doing it on a more massive scale. But think about it for a second. The reason we have oxygen is because bacteria who produced O2 as a POISONOUS waste product literally changed the components of the atmosphere. Were they killing the earth too?

All of this is subjective. People need to realize that the environment is constantly changing and life is constantly adapting and to say that something is “bad” just means it’s not conducive to most current life.

fscp4s,Paligor,"Facebook, Instagram and other ""hated"" social media are better than Reddit.","Reddit has its bright sides - great, small communities moderated by the respective subreddits' passionate mod teams, but for the most part, it's utterly terrible: idiotic subreddit rules, moderators on power-trips, anti-hate operations with brigading subreddits that nobody does anything about **cough** AHS **cough**.

Trending posts going against the narrative get regularly removed, dank jokes are just circlejerks and better memes can be found absolutely anywhere else besides here (because good memes get you banned here); also, don't even get me started on the quarantines of right-wing subreddits.

You see, Reddit, if it truly was a free platform, should allow for even the other opinions to have their platform, otherwise if you push them out, you end up with the risk of radicalising them by pushing them further into the radical echo chambers like 4chan. Nationalists aren't terrible. Anti-globalists aren't marching around with jackboots and singing ""Die Fahne hoch"". They are people with different viewpoints and that's it. 

On Instagram, you get dank memes which variate outside the Reddit's hive minded anti-Trumpism. On Facebook, people actually can interact with each other on meme pages and have a go at each other without the ""y'all can't behave"". Even the right-wing pages and groups on Facebook are safer than here.

There are a few bad apples everywhere, but acting like there are way more than in reality, then it's a sure way of destroying your platform. And as much as I hate to admit it, Facebook corporation isn't going the way of the dodo anytime soon because they know when to stop.

fsckfe,Remarkably-Second,Shakespeare is shit,"Shakespeare is maybe the biggest fraud that I've ever learned about in my entire time in education. People have literally idolised this man for decades and for what? Writing a couple surface level plays and some sonnets? Yet students learn about him as if he saved humanity from eternal illiteracy and the extent to which his plays are jerked off is unbelievable. 

We act like he is saying some profound shit just because humans dont speak like the people in his plays anymore but most of the ""themes"" are not clever in any way whatsoever. There is no subtlety to any of his ""messages"". I am absolutely convinced Shakespeare was high as a kite when he wrote his plays. Even staples dont make paper as thin as the plots of his plays. 

Plus, they are so incredibly outdated (much ado about nothing is an apt example here) that when there is any discussion about it, it all comes down to ""treating women like second class citizens is bad and back in those old times, women weren't treated properly"" WOW WANT A FUCKING COOKIE FOR THAT ASTUTE OBSERVERVATION?  

Modern art and literature are so much more important because its modern. Some screenplays from the past few decades are some of the most powerful works of literature that I have ever witnessed. In Romeo and Juliet, love is supposed to be this powerful force that supersedes all other values? Fantastic. There are 5 other screenplays and books that explore this idea better than R&amp;J. His writing is tantamount to the content in the im14andthisisdeep subreddit.

We dont need to learn about references that were relevant 400 years ago. Children in school should learn about the issues concerning them, today, through stories that have more significance on their lives because they actually discuss themes rather than throwing them on the table and saying, ""See? I'm smart"". Shakespeare is only well known because he did a few story tropes for the first time in playwriting and even those he did badly.

fsckbe,FamousAmosAB,I hate the over use of the words “frontline” and “essential”,"I know these are tough times and it’s great to see the community coming together (hoarding supplies aside) and I’m not against supporting each other BUT I really dislike the over use of these words, I think the “essential workers” list is pretty loose and I know several companies that have found themselves under loopholes which I really can’t see as being essential (a custom wardrobe company for example, car sales, new home sales etc) 

Now I’m happy for the staff that they haven’t lost their jobs but in the grand scheme of things seems kind of counter productive to have such a wide spread description

And frontline annoys me more, medical staff are doing incredible work and where I would consider “frontline” they are willingly facing the virus and putting themselves right in front of it. Grocery workers, delivery drivers etc are not. I’m not saying they aren’t essential and taking a greater risk but they are not front line in my opinion.",2,1585659931,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsckbe/i_hate_the_over_use_of_the_words_frontline_and/,unpopularopinion,1

fscf4b,loveselderscrolls,"Polyamory people are manipulative, self-absorbed, selfish, and downright cruel","From my own experiences, which are unfortunately plentiful and widely negative. 

I'm from the lgbt/bi community and meet lots of poly people regularly, since a lot of them happen to be bi/pan. Recently a friend got in a relationship with a poly person, which only widened our circle of poly acquaintances.
I used to be interested in the lifestyle, but after meeting poly people and going on dates with them, my opinion has drastically changed for the absolute worse. I'll let you judge by yourselves. 

Here's a list of my experiences ;

went to a bi meet-up that was mostly full of poly people, during which (in only 2 hours) those following happened ;
-been asked to come to a man's basement to be 'tied up' and experiment with bdsm, before even knowing his name
-been told by a woman that she enjoys cheating on her main partner but would 'freak out' if he ever tried to have secondary partners, as she is 'the one in control'. She was also wearing her hair glued together in an amidala hairdo she had had for the past 2 years.
-been told by an older man I look a lot like his underage daughter, then immediately afterward been asked to come with him to a polyamory orgy
-been told by a woman she was only here to pick up a bi girl for her boyfriend's 'birthday present' 

Spent many parties and evenings with poly acquaintances from the bi community and friend's circles, where ;
-a poly woman fondled my breasts without my consent, and sulked when I told her to stop
-another poly woman hounded me all night to tell me about her sexual experiences in excruciating details, her sexual assault (supposedly to gain pity), propositioning me, and told me I was stuck up once I  told her I wasn't interested (once again, I didn't even know her name)
-many, many unending talks about how stuck up and selfish mono people are
-many, many unending talks from poly women about how they love to make out in front of taken mono men to 'tempt them', and even 'stealing' mono men from their friends, how sexy and powerful it makes them feel, etc
-many, many, many talks about how they cheat, have cheated, and will cheat again ('I hide this or that partner from my main partner because they don't like them', or 'I can have as many partners as I want but I forbid my partner from seeing anyone else', or 'they need permission, but I don't', or straight up 'I cheated but it was their fault for being mono') 

Went on a date with a poly acquaintance, which was the last nail on the coffin ;
-she came along with another poly friend without telling me, and they spent the night talking about making out in front of men to tempt them then yell at them when they try to flirt back, because it made them feel 'powerful'
-reacted with hostility when I said I was thinking more and more I only wanted to be with women--it was downright homophobia at some point ('everyone is bi and that's just society telling you to pick, it's not natural') 
-flirted with the server and asked for his number, which following their previous talks, made me wonder if this was some sort of female powerplay to them ('see how I can seduce anyone during our date?')
-told me in no uncertain terms my friend's partner was cheating on them with another poly friend, and that it was my friend's fault, because she was a 'stuck up mono'

After that I've tried to limit my interactions with poly people as best I could. I really tried to think the best of them, but afrer meeting 30+ poly people and all of them being all the same flavor of horrible, I can't have any sympathy for any of them. 

They love to talk about communication, consent, and love, but don't apply any of them in their relationships. When they talk about their relationships, they only ever think about what they gain from them ('this partner provides me with x, this one with y, if I'm tired of my main partner I can talk shit about them to my secondary partner and vice versa, this partner I only see when I need good sex, this partner is in our poly couple because my partner wanted a ginger'), it's only ever self centered ; people are objects to collect and exploit, then throw away once they speak up or theyre not fun anymore (seen twice). If a mono partner doesn't want to try out poly, then they just do it behind their backs or pressure them until they say yes (another experience ; an acquaintance wanted to be poly, coerced her 5 years partner to say yes, went out with many others, then dumped him once she found a suitable replacement).

I consider myself a pretty open person, I've been in open relationships, I've had threesomes, I've been in the lgbt community for a decade. But I'm completely appalled and disgusted by the way the poly community acts. They're manipulative, selfish, self centered, and downright cruel to others, and I can't find a single poly person to show a little bit of morality and change my mind.",0,1585659355,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fscf4b/polyamory_people_are_manipulative_selfabsorbed/,unpopularopinion,1

A hero is someone who does something so extraordinary above and beyond the normal call of duty that most peope would never consider doing it. Heroic is jumping on a grenade to save your buddies lives. Heroic is a self sacrifice beyond what most people could comprehend. 

Going to work day after day and putting in longer hours than normal is not heroic. Its what you do because you signed on to do it.

fsc9zi,BreezelessCheese,I’m sick and tired of only health care workers and grocery clerks getting all the praise.,"First things first: health care workers are literally saving lives. We would be a doomed society without them. They are on front lines risking everything to keep us healthy. All the respect and well wishes towards them. Grocery clerks are also one of the most important groups of workers. They deserve so much for their work and contributions.

With that said, being an electrical power plant worker who comes into work 5-6 times a week to keep the lights on, I don’t feel any love. I too am putting my own health at risk so that hundreds of thousands can continue to charge their phones, play video games, and keep the ventilators running. I work at a nuclear power plant, and we output more electricity than any plant within 500 miles of us. I’m not saying I need praise for what I do, but it would be refreshing to see that the country is not forgetting the other essential workers. And unlike a fossil fuel plant that needs a handful of people to output to the grid, we have hundreds, every day, showing up to ensure we safely and reliably keep the power coming.

Again, I have all the respect and love in the world for those out on front lines battling this pandemic. I just don’t want my fellow electrical plant workers to be forgotten.

fsc4lj,Rainman92,Reddit is a breeding ground for the wrong kind of tolerance.,"Over the few years I have been on this site I have seen too many terrible things to even remember. To list a few I can remember there was
- videos from during and after several tragic shootings.
- news breaking on how the worlds wealthiest are girding there money in such a way to prevent having to pay a single tax where it was due.
- a massive pedophile ring being exposed on the worlds wealthiest and celebrities.
- several attempts by varying countries about to start world war 3.

When each one of these things came to light, there was rage, panic, even a call for justice. Yet, as time passed these huge events faded into background noise and we moved on with our lives as if nothing had happened, cause we all collectively thought, what can I do? It is creating a tolerance in us to see all these horrible things and just accept them because we believe there’s absolutely nothing we can do but piss and moan about it on here and it’s sickening.

Reddit really is a terrible site, because even though it gives us access to so much information, we still do nothing. We see the injustice in this world, have our moment of rage, and then just move on.",6,1585658084,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsc4lj/reddit_is_a_breeding_ground_for_the_wrong_kind_of/,unpopularopinion,1

I, personally, know of 2 people that have tested positive for this thing.

Both said they had no symptoms at all, except one had "" a bit of a sore throat"".

So I ask you,  how is it I happen to know two of the sick people ( I have no social media,  these are a friend and a friend of a friend) and there  are only 788,000, in the WHOLE WORLD!  It would be extremely ""lucky"" to know one person in the whole world,  but somehow I know 2 of them??   What kind of rare statistics is that??

In saying that,   CLEARLY there are millions upon millions of us that have this thing and have almost no symptoms!  So WTF is much of the media quoting the death rate at 4.7%?  Why are they using the numbers of reported cases and the number of reported deaths to get  their percentages??  That is DISGUSTING for the media to do that!  I think we can all understand why places like Russia and China limit the media when reporting like that occurs.

Kids today think porn is a debilitating addiction, drinking two beers a day is alcoholism and smokers might as well be murderers. They are way more inclined to run to the authorities and tattle on anyone for the slightest indescretion and then scream at the injustice when people don't like them for it. Many of them call weed smokers ""drug addicts"" and that infidelity should be a crime. 

It's as if they were raised in a tornado of public service announcements that use hyperbole to demonize everything that we thought were FUN 30 years ago and they have refused to question any of the bullshit that they were taught.

They are going to be poor there also. But since there is no work and the fear of death is upon them, they'd rather die at home than elsewhere.

All this because we want to save rich old people from dying from a virus whose death rate is less than 5%. So many jobs are not going to come back. Those which will come back, will not pay the same. Already two states have announced pay cut for govt employees. In some days, other states will follow suit. So many young people I know have taken loans to buy houses, cars, etc They're all going to be thrown back into poverty once again.

fsbmaj,realalexjean,Successful people who are jerks are completely justified.,"Well known people get so many hateful filled messages online. Almost always it’s unprovoked.

In general, most people, want to see others fail. At every opportunity, they will discourage one’s effort in doing something beyond expectations. Though, there are a few people one can surround oneself with who want to see others thrive.

Growing up, some kids are expected to “fail”, and when they thrive, they are accused of “thinking they are better than everybody”. If they  fail, the doubters become smug and proud. If they prevail, the doubters lash out.

Ambitious people will always be despised and hated, not because they are jerks, but because those who hate on them are full of jealousy and envy. Anytime someone tries to make something of themselves, haters will assault their character and discourage them in their mission.

So when a very successful person is accused of being an asshole, I usually give that person the benefit of the doubt, because I know they are already hated by many. 

And if I find out it were true, I don’t really care. Most likely, that person has had a life full of people wanting to see them fail. Deservedly so, they return the favor, because when they prevail and overcome the challenges, the hate never stops. Ambitious people are marked by society with the sin of being ambitious.

I’m not say it’s okay to be a jerk, but can you blame them? Returning unkindness with unkindness. You get what you deserve.",5,1585655774,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsbmaj/successful_people_who_are_jerks_are_completely/,unpopularopinion,1

i've heard from lesbians that stds aren't really a problem with lesbians. they're a big problem in the gay community. hiv is still such a huge threat that every sexually active gay man is expected to take medicine to stop it from infecting you. and that's just one disease. there are so many horrible stds, some of which are even resistant to treatment. lesbians can still get stds, but from what i've heard, it's not a huge issue.

lesbians also just have better sex with multiple orgasms. it's so difficult to get a prostate orgasm, that most bottoms don't even finish before the top finishes. it's awful. not to mention the amount of lube you need and patience you need to penetrate your partner's ass without hurting your partner. also, lesbian sex seems so much simpler. the amount of dedication bottoms have to making sure their ass is clean and regulating their diet so that sex is less... shitty, is ridiculous. when two guys get into the moment, the bottom has to stop everything and go into the bathroom to loosen and lube his hole. lesbians can just get into sex.

also my straight friends seem so much closer to my lesbian friends than to me. i just hate being left out because i'm a gay guy. i want to be able to talk about boobs and stuff with my friends, but i'm cursed with this dumb sexual attraction to men, and i can't for the life of me find women attractive no matter how hard i try and it sucks.

lesbians are just so much cooler. they don't really have to hide themselves. they seem to connect with men on a level i don't think i could ever. they are much more approachable than the gay men i've met in my life. i just wish i could be one of them.",0,1585655256,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsbihf/being_a_lesbian_is_preferable_to_being_a_gay_man/,unpopularopinion,1

People act like all they did was copy and paste, but if anyone on /r/gameofthrones, /r/freefolk, or /r/television were handed the ASOIAF series and told to adapt each book into an episode, 99.9% of the people who attempted would turn in utter shit. Their best script would be far worse than the worst script of season 8. 

I've heard repeatedly how season 8 is the worst season in television. And the worst written thing they've ever seen. I think season 8 is fine, just not mind blowing amazing like the first few. Go watch season 10 of Hawaii Five-0 or season 42 of NCIS and tell me the writing is better than Game of Thrones.

People have very short term memory. Right now, the MCU is the biggest film franchise on the planet, which most people seem to enjoy.

fsbbjc,violentoverthinker,You need a bit of both capitalism and socialism to succeed as a civilisation,"I've seen a lot of people argue about exactly which economic system is the best or is the most successful. Truth be told, it's neither, or both. There's no truly capitalist country in the world, and there has yet to be one truly, successful socialist country in the world. No, the Nordic countries are not socialist, they have clarified it themselves. They're capitalist, welfare states. Here's where a lot of socialists get confused between socialism and public welfare. Having free/ low cost education, healthcare and other necessities doesn't make a country socialist. If private sectors are still functioning freely or with little restraints or at all, it's a capitalist economy. People tend to confuse capitalism and crony capitalism, the latter being a radical version of capitalism where no heed is given to citizen welfare. This would lead to major uprisings as well, as seen in the French Revolution, which was among other things, an uprising of the Third Class against the Aristocracy due to mounting wealth inequality. Such uprisings, although for different causes, are common in purely socialist and communist countries as well. Capitalism is very much necessary in an economy, but not without certain restraints. Price ceiling/price floor for all necessary commodities, free/subsidized healthcare and education, and competition laws preventing monopolisation of an industry can and should exist alongside a free market and a thriving privet sector system, resulting in a welfare state. This was the Keynesian theory, whose implementation finally revived the dead market of the USA back in the recession of 2008. Speaking of which , the US isn't completely capitalist as some would like you to believe either. It has free public education, making it a hybrid as well, although it needs work in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. So stop believing in a 100% extreme that can and will never work out and instead believe in a viable, hybrid option.",352,1585654299,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsbbjc/you_need_a_bit_of_both_capitalism_and_socialism/,unpopularopinion,1

Star Wars is a big offender in this regard for me :  

* in the prequels : Evan McGregor, Lliam Nelson, Natalie Portman, Samuel L Jackson ...  
* in the sequels : Benicio del Toro  
* In rogue One : Donnie Yen, Forest Whitaker ...  
* Solo : Emilia Clark, Woody Harrelson, Donald Glover ...  

Lord of the ring did it a also but I felt it was less painful for some reason, the characters had less screen time and most of them are so much more famous after getting the role ...   

Clearly some of them were fantastic for their role but I can't help seeing them as one or some of their former roles and it's so obvious that it breaks the immersion. Plus these movies don't need the star factor so much to get the success they got. Fans will flock en masse to see them regardless.

fsb0g9,Mu57y,Julia Roberts should not have been allowed to play as Auggie's mom in the movie 'Wonder',"This is pretty self explanatory... 

In 1991, she was going to marry this Kiefer Sutherland. But then, she just abruptly called off the wedding 3 days before the nuptials. After this, for whatever reason, she went to Ireland and hooked up with Jason Patric, who was a friend of Kiefer Sutherland. 

Then, a number of years later, she dropped her 4-year relationship with the actor Benjamin Bratt while  going to the press and spinning up the truth in her favour. 

In 2000, she started dating Danny Moder while he was still married to his wife, Vera Steimberg. Then, Julia Roberts was publicly wearing a shirt say ""A low Vera"". What's worse is that she never expressed remorse for wearing this shirt. 

These are just some of the cruel, horrible things Roberts has done in her unremarkable career. Given that, why should she be someone who is supposed to be kind, caring, and patient? At least get an actor who has some of that in real life.",3,1585652807,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fsb0g9/julia_roberts_should_not_have_been_allowed_to/,unpopularopinion,1

On the other hand, women get a free pass to whine about men that don't want a relationship with them. ""Man are all pigs they just want sex and no relationship waaaah"" - most people try to comfort her, sympathize, empathize, agree with her, soothe her, telling her ""everything will be all right, you're amazing person and you're a princess you'll find your prince one day"".

As a man, if I were publicly saying/joking that I would definitely need beer in order to keep my sanity around my kids, I think the reaction would be different. When a mom ""needs"" wine, it's treated as understandable and funny, but when a dad needs beer/bourbon/etc., he has a problem.

Men are shamed for being raped cuz they should love sex and they should just like it. They should be happy a woman want sex with them. So men shouldnt refuse. And if theyre raped by a men, they should be ashamed n shit.

fsa49p,vikingwarrior2020,Not everyone deserves to survive a major disaster event.,"I'm one of those self-quarantine people, I guess most of us are. My immune system is near indestructible, which is why I don't come near anyone, because I could indirectly kill someone.

There are some though, who still go out and meet others, because what could possibly go wrong? I go out once or twice a week for about an hour or two, mostly to fetch groceries or a walk where no one is. And there they are, walking in small groups in the sun, or sitting in small groups and the groups are close to each other. 

Those who still act as if we don't need to chill for a few months, have no respect for the well being of others and like we humans can quickly turn to animals when things go wrong, these people would be sacrificed very fast to save the rest in the case of a major disaster.

If we had zombies, it's the type you use as bait to save 10 others.

Somewhere along the way, after the hippies began demanding justice, we slowly began to believe the bullshit that everyone is equal. Everyone is not equal, everyone is different. We don't even respect that people are innocent until proven guilty anymore, the internet makes sure of that. Diversity, inclusion, justice, equality, the law and all other things we have come up with to ensure a great society, fly right out the window the minute someone gets too powerful, or society starts breaking down. Once someone disrespects the safety of the tribe, that someone becomes a threat.

All of the work we've been assigned has been easy, but it's definitely quanitity of quality here. If you don't understand something, tough shit. There's absolutely no middle ground for us, it's either a ton of super easy work, or a moderate amount of difficult. I swear, some teachers don't even read what they give us. There's one teacher in particular who is assigning chapter long passages which she clearly didn't read (She assigned a story we had to analyze about a man dying in the snowy woods or something and tried to kill his dog in desperation to warm up with fingers to make a fire. The man dies. The end). I can't really focus when I'm at home, and I constantly find myself looking at my phone or something because tedious, boring work isn't engaging. Overall, school is far superior because at least there we can ask about what we are learning, or have the teachers actually do their jobs as apposed to posting walls of text about dying men, killing dogs, a little girl dying of pnuemonia, and rich dudes from the 1900s.

They do it as if it was his choice to disappoint in that area and discourage these men from living out his sexuality because of it, which is kind of a paradox, since women themselves often resent being evaluated on the basis of outer appearance.

fs9sw5,rbemr715,People shouldn't be thankful that manufacturers voluntarily produce medical supplies!,"   
  Korea, China, Taiwan, and many other countries have declared an emergency. Then they ordered the factories in their country to make the necessary supplies. and those states just take supplies at a specified price. Of course, It wasn't the market price or the price set by the manufacturers. Can you imagine how expensive the market price of medical supplies will be in this situation? Businesses will try to pursue profits even in this situation, and the state has stopped it. It's a state function in an emergency.   
   
 Some might say ""This is possible because those countries are not 'democratic' or 'too authoritarian'. ""

 No. 

 People saying it's a time of war. It's no wonder that Ford under the command of the state created a tank during the war. Because protecting the country is protecting Ford himself. And it's ridiculous to wait and expect to do it voluntarily. The right to force companies to produce something at times like this is reserved for the head of the administration in any country. 

  
So if a country relies on a company's 'charity' or 'goodness' in this situation, that's wrong! That is, the government is not playing its part.  People shouldn't be grateful for companies to spontaneously use a few factory lines. People have to ask why the state doesn't enforce it. 

  Too anti-capitalist? No, I am a capitalist. But every ideology can exist only if the state and citizens exist. There is a time when the state has to step up for capitalism.

To me it just sounds stupid. Like I get it that they dont want other races to use the word. Thats just weird and disrespectful, and tbh very cringe. 

But back when we had all the slave shit, white ppl used that word for their ""black slaves"". And those white ppl were terrible ppl. But you had a few black ppl who had slaves too, or at least were above the slaves. And they used the N word too, to adress the slaves. And they were seen as even worse then the white ppl. 

So shouldnt a black person who calls an other black person the N word be even worse?

Like how did it even became normal to use that word? The whole point of the word is to disrespect people with a darker skin. Its just so weird to me. Just call people bro or whatever. 

I get that its usually not meant to disrespect anyone. I just dont think anyone should use that word. We should just leave it in the past. Focus on the fact that we are all the same and stuff.

fs9oio,Googaloog,I don't like Gordon Ramsay.,"Gordon Ramsay, I'm sure, is not a bad person. From what I've seen of him on TV and YouTube, he seems like a reasonably nice guy - certainly a good family man if nothing else and you can tell he does care about his wife and kids. However, I feel that he has normalised aggression and a lack of professionalism in the cooking industry to the extent where it has become expected to be yelled at by a head chef or mentor. And yes, he's nice to kids on programmes like MasterChef Junior, but if he can be nice to the kids why can't he treat the adults with a modicum of respect and politeness? You might be thinking, ""oh well it's because he's a really good chef and really cares about food and cooks to a very high standard so when he sees people who cook poorly/don't care about what they serve he's really upset by it"", which is fair enough, but his treatment of other people is certainly still unwarranted despite this. Some of the things he has done on camera have normalised aggression in the cooking industry to an unreasonable level. And yes, it might be part of his way to build an exciting media/entertainment persona, but there are other ways of going about this than aggression.",10,1585645745,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs9oio/i_dont_like_gordon_ramsay/,unpopularopinion,1

fs9myg,paddyfourfingers,Democracy is a failed experiment.,"Democracy was always the exception, and never the rule.

Since the dawn of humanity we have always had a King, an Alpha leader. That wanted the best for his land and his people. That is found all throughout nature, and more importantly it is found among primates like ourselves, Gorillas and Chimps. 

The strongest and the best always lead. But in modern times it is no longer the strongest or the best, but the richest, and whoever has the most media propaganda backing their campaign. 

If I walk through the street, I do not trust the people I see with my vote. I see homeless, single teen mothers, unemployed, uneducated and I do not want them to make decisions for me. Democracy can only work if the majority are intellectual and understand politics and economics. But the majority of people in the modern world are not educated on these matters and they should not have the power to shape our societies.

A PhD in Politics and Econimics should not have his vote cancelled by a homeless alcoholic. That is not democracy, that is just stupidity.

I propose an Aptitude tests prior to obtaining the right to vote, a test which proves that you have the knowledge and understanding of what you are voting for, an understanding of the reprecussions of your vote and a basic understanding of politics and economics.",119,1585645526,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs9myg/democracy_is_a_failed_experiment/,unpopularopinion,1

As a man one actually need to consistently try and risk being denied, having enough courage ask a girl out is something most men would have difficulty doing , and once you manage to. You risk getting denied which completely destroys your self esteem.

fs98on,YZJay,Saying Disney inhibits creativity by lengthening copyright time limits is misguided,"The Disney copyright argument should be arguing about trademark.
  
One of the loudest complaints when talking about Disney and copyright is that it hinders creativity for derivative works, that we should see works of art based on Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty by now. Or that James Bond should be public domain already and we should see more James Bond films by other studios.   
  
But doesn't copyright only protect the actual work of art from copying, redistributing and republishing? If Disney were to lose the copyright to Sleeping Beauty, they still own the trademark to Aurora's design, they still own the fonts used in the film as it's not protected by copyright but trademark. And story structure isn’t strictly protected, not only have stories similar to Disney’s versions of Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty been made by studios other than Disney, modern original stories are also being reused by modern stories. You can’t copyright glittering vampires or mechs fighting kaijus now can you? 
  
So isn't the loudest argument for shortening copyright length kind of misguided? And instead should be about trademark?",12,1585643296,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs98on/saying_disney_inhibits_creativity_by_lengthening/,unpopularopinion,1

* He was involved in the death a 6-year-old boy that was shot dead in 1992, the bullet that killed the boy was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Tupac. His stepbrother was initially arrested on suspicion of firing the weapon, no charges were filed due to lack of witness. Tupac agreed to pay a $300,000–$500,000 settlement to the parents.
* He was charged for shooting a police officer in 1993. The officers were drunk and in possession of stolen guns. One of the officer's and was charged with firing at Tupac's car and lying to the police during the investigation. The police officers and Tupac were both at fault.

fs908p,NogvarotsChampion,Simp is not a bad thing,"I recently learned about a word, and behind it, a group/school of thought that believe that placing a persons worth higher than their own is somehow disreputable. More than that the ideology comes with the assumption that people that do such a thing are looking for something out of it, regardless of the lack of any kind of evidence against or lacking in the defense of such an assumption.

I'm just going to say it valuing someone based on their gender is not wrong. It's something that already happens on a mass media level with many of the lesser appreciated or unrecognized gender identities. There a reason attractions exist, undervaluing them and their ability to influence world viewpoint is, in my opinion, a mistake. Men are less valuable by nature of supply and demand. in 2018 alone there was a .05% differential of male births to female births worldwide. Correct my math if i'm wrong but that's at least three hundred seventy-six million more men than women. 

More than that placing someone's well-being above ones own is admirable in many ways. Humanity is built on empathy on the ability to recognize another over oneself. Many models of how Humanity achieved it's evolutionary position of power amongst the other species is just this ability. Humility isn't wrong. In many ways on a societal level it may even be warranted. I'm not going to say people should pay for the sins of their fathers, but i also don't think it's any coincidence that acts of sexual violence are nearly all perpetuated by men. This could suggest many things, but one that could make sense, and therefore doesn't need collect undue criticism, is that there could be something in the male make up, or perhaps in the cultural male make up that evokes something less than self-control maybe even an entitlement that again if referencing numbers, just isn't there. In that way a more civilization cohesive position may be on the side of more feminine qualities. In a world devoid of physical threats, a more nurturing role perhaps has greater efficacy and therefore is more necessary. In many ways those that do not have that could find much meaning upholding it/protecting it. After all at the very root of the natural man's evolutionary state is that one man can perform the reproductive work of many, and that only the woman needs survive or remain healthy.

All this to say is that in my opinion the idea posited that this lifestyle or ideology of ""simp"" is not wrong. Moreover I fear that for at least some of it's propagators that decry ""simp"", their sentiment may be born out of entitlement of which if stripped to it's most basic form, there is none. All a person is entitled to upon birth is to die, nothing else is assured.

Alright, rant over, i'm not sure i got my opinion across as i had meant to, but i hope the essence of what i'm saying is still detectable. As is always the case i could be wrong, my opinion could be in poor taste, but as of now i stick to it, and perhaps there are those that agree.",6,1585642018,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs908p/simp_is_not_a_bad_thing/,unpopularopinion,1

fs8vre,Tantivy_Tantivy,I do not like Meghan Markle,"I'm not sure if this is unpopular or not but I really dislike her. 

I'm in the opinion that there is a difference between breaking stereotypes and breaking rules. When you're in a family with so much history and importance, you don't just marry in to the royal family and break the tradition of the family, especially when this family represents a freaking country. It's not empowering, it's disrespectful.

She also seems to still just be an actress. All this clinging onto Harry like she needs to announce Harry is all hers or some shit, no one freaking cares. You have yourself a prince and we can be happy for you about it that's all. And then she goes ham about ""no one asked me how I feel!"" Who is supposed to ask you how you feel, Meghan? You're in a family that's under public scrutiny all the darn time and you should at least shoulder some responsibilities and expectations. Why tell the public no one asks you how you feel when no member of the public can speak to you anyways

Thirdly on the fact that she is going back to her personal endeavours. She no longer has the title of a duchess anymore then, so I dunno why it feels like she's still monetising that label. I also wonder why she didn't think to tell the queen... For god's sake it's the royal family once again. Their PR is important because they are a representative for a whole country. Who do you think you are?

Might I also mention that she pays little attention to the needs of her own side of the family, except her mother. I don't understand because I don't think her father ever mistreated her and no sources from the family say that. Incidentally her mother is black I wonder if that might be why...? Maybe it's a bit of a jump and I'm going to offend a ton of people, but I'm thinking this might be it.

Lastly, if you try to bring these up, it's assumed you are a racist. That pisses me off even more because I haven't bashed her for her race and I'm not commenting on her appearance. She's pretty. But for the love of God she feels to me like this self entitled person who is unwilling to shoulder the expectations and responsibility she has by marrying into the royal family, and puts her preferences before others. It's not like those expectations are even that bad anyways. And if it's rather strict, it's the royal family after all. How can you expect to join that big family and not have duties, expectations, and their PR to uphold?

TLDR I just don't like Meghan Markle and it's not racist.",57,1585641356,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8vre/i_do_not_like_meghan_markle/,unpopularopinion,1

fs8rfp,swimgurlie25,Teachers don’t deserve more pay than they get.,"Don’t get me wrong, I respect and admire teachers and the amount of patience and knowledge they must have to effectively teach students and deal with their bs (along with dealing with parents), but I’m constantly seeing these posts about how teachers should be paid extravagantly and how it’s one of the hardest jobs out there... etc etc. Sure, I can see how it can be difficult at times (just like many other jobs, only in a different way) and to some who never deal with kids, it may sound like a nightmare only a saint could dream of choosing as a profession... But it really comes down to this: 

Supply and demand.

When supply exceeds demand, the price people are willing to pay for that supply goes down.

Millions upon millions of young adults pursue teaching as a career every year, knowing full well the salary they’re going to be making. If it is such difficult job (I’m not saying it is or isn’t, I’m simply referencing what the common argument is for higher pay) and deserving of much more pay, why are there so many people willing to do the job at the current rate? What incentive would there be to raise the average salary of teachers if the supply keeps steadily coming every year?

I guess what I’m saying is, it’s not that I think they don’t deserve more from a philanthropic standpoint (I appreciate all the actual great teachers out there), but from a purely practical business standpoint, teachers aren’t worth more than they’re paid. There is simply a higher supply than there is demand.",28,1585640720,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8rfp/teachers_dont_deserve_more_pay_than_they_get/,unpopularopinion,1
fs8r7f,throwaway4738299,Weed is not good for society,"Weed ultimately leads to bad choices/hedonism. I have a lot of experience in this. In high school, my friends for the most part were druggies. One in particular sold and did drugs very regularly. He’s not necessarily a terrible person, but certainly not a good or happy one. My other friends are also unproductive and not driven. 

There are underlying mental health issues with all drug users including myself. Don’t pull the “well I know that one guy who’s a doctor and uses weed” or “im successful and smoke” or “my friends aren’t like that” etc etc. Those are excuses so you don’t have to face your bad behavior and choices. 

I hear people say that all of the time, and they are extremely toxic and can’t apologize for anything. Manipulative too. Of course, there are exceptions. But after a lot of experience with drug and alcohol users, it’s a way to deal with their anguish and pain. 

Some aren’t even aware they are doing it for that reason. In my case I was aware for awhile but then recently felt really good about myself for making progress in the gym. I was less anxious and felt pretty happy. I then realized that I had been living in a fake reality and wasn’t actually feeling as happy as I thought I was because I experienced this higher happiness. 

Don’t hit me with the “it fixes anxiety and depression” because it doesn’t. Also don’t talk about the minority of people who use it for actual medical reasons. Seizures, epilepsy, that kind of thing. Those people NEED it. The rest of us don’t.

I don't like thinking about people blowing their nose a little bit, and the action does not convey the feeling they have. It's a private reflex we have, definitely not as appropriate in a social context. Like without following it up with words it is awkward in person.

And the response Axl made after these accusations was piss poor also. Not like their music was anthing special to write home about, Axl was trying to grab a lot of attention, cause that's what records sell, and he didn't do a good job at it to be honest, and yet this band is still proclaimed as one of the greatest bands in American rock history when really, they weren't anything special from your average metal band.

I have friends that tell me it is so hard to get a job at any company on that list. I have worked for Intuit for years and am moving to HubSpot. My wife works for Apple (also on the list) and it was not terribly hard for her to get it.

fs8ji9,CherryPhoenix679,Shane Dawson is not as good a youtuber as everyone acts,"Sorry this is longer than I thought it'd be

His videos are more like long vlogs than documentaries, and the constant overreacting is super annoying in his videos. He does nowhere near as much research as he should be for his videos, especially when he did the Jake Paul series. 

The way he and the therapist lady talked and spoke about AntiSocial Personality Disorder (sorry if I got that wrong) was absolutely disgusting. They were calling it gross, and icky, acting as if they were talking about murder or rape instead of talking about a mental disorder that many people deal with. They handled the situation rudely when fans said something about it and called them insensitive. They claimed that just because people who have the disorder won't care, it's fine, completely forgetting that they have friends and family around them that do care that someone is basically calling someone they know disgusting for something they have no control over. I personally deal with PTSD, which is a mental disorder and if he made a video about that in the style and fashion he made this one I'd get so depressed and would feel like he didn't care. That entire video annoys me and it just seemed like it was Shane trying to tell everyone that they're sociopaths and he isn't. The video PewDiePie did basically covers my thoughts on this video.

The way he also treated Alissa Violet annoys me. Alissa alleged that Jake did abuse her, but he acted like he didn't just because there wasnt much physical abuse, acting as if mental abuse isnt a thing. He also seemed to go so much harder on her with questioning than he did with Jake. It just seemed that he wanted to paint a narrative that Jake was the good guy. Shane seemed to do no research other than what is seen in the videos. Also in the video with the therapist they say that when you first meet a sociopath, they seem ""normal"" and nice and friendly, and then when Jake was like that when they met him they were like ""No he can't be a sociopath"". Also the fact they were trying to diagnose someone with a mental disorder annoys me as well. 

Some of the interactions he has on twitter are awful too. He can't seem to handle any criticism, and just moans about how much work he's put into the videos when someone says something. I know one time a fan tweeted at him telling him to rest and relax (something like that I can't remember) and he retweeted it and commented that he'd been editing all day and moaned at her when she was concerned for him. A bunch of his stans ended up tweeting and saying horrible things to her on the original tweet as well. 

I hate how much he says he's poor, when he lives in a multi million dollar mansion. Especially since we now know he made millions of the makeup pallet and more of the merch. 

He only really got into makeup when he learnt he could make money off it. 

I also don't understand how or why he's friends with Trisha Paytas. She's probably nice to him behind closed doors, but he needs to come out and say something when she getting into some of the drama she is getting into. It's disgusting, but yet he stays silent when she does these things and continues to promote her. He himself is part of community's she has been horrible too. I don't know if he's saying anything in private but it's not working and someone she is friends with needs to speak about her behaviour publicly. Especially after the recent videos.

Sorry this was long, he just annoys me at this point. I prefer his older videos so much. 

Also in his most recent series about the pallet, he definitely tried to manipulate the narrative around James, Tati and Jeffree. He showed clips of him reacting to  Tati's videos, but I don't think he reacted to James' 2nd video where he debunked some of the lies. He also never covered or said anything about what Jeffree said or tweeted at the time. 

In conclusion, I prefer his older videos and he needs friends that don't surround their life in money. I don't mind his conspiracy theory videos or his ghost hunting videos either.",36,1585639559,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8ji9/shane_dawson_is_not_as_good_a_youtuber_as/,unpopularopinion,1

fs8hgh,csendes13,Pedophiles need help not persecution,"Hear me out for this one. Yes, people who molest children; a child molester commit one of the most depraved, abhorrent, repulsive offences a person can do. This is not debated. (Note that there is a difference between a pedophile (attraction only) and a child molester (physical acts)).

In my undergraduate degree (Criminology and Psychology) I decided to write a paper on child exploitation material and the speciality units that dealt with cases of child exploitation material. Through my research, unsurprisingly... I learnt that that by viewing such horrible content it could lead to psychological implications, with some investigators becoming desensitised and in other cases they could even become attracted to children. That led me to try find out what support services were in place. For the investigators, there was limited help, but nonetheless something. Often the solution was limiting their time of service on the specialty units, counselling etc. 

I then started researching about pedophiles themselves, what is in place to help them?  Ultimately for people who recognise that they are attracted to children, a pedophile... there is little to no help available. If they tell their doctor, they could be reported, they fear prosecution, they are often deeply ashamed. Scared of the risks and stigma attached to seeking help for being attracted to children. Not many people want to deal with what society generally seems to be the lowest of the low. Practitioners don’t want to be associated and there’s limited formal services available. Understandable yes, but does it help prevent harm to children? No. I regard protecting children from harm as the top priority. 

I would argue that through the lack of support and services available puts children at a higher risk of harm. Their behaviour goes unchecked, with nothing available to help them. This could lead to offending behaviour as there isn’t some form of intervention or rehabilitation at an earlier stage. I argue that prevention of child molestation is the best answer, not punishing them when they have already caused harm. This does not go to say that there shouldn’t be consequences for their actions. If they commit acts of child molestation, they should be dealt with accordingly by the law, but also given treatment. The death penalty which many call for is also unproductive, as it doesn’t prevent it from happening in the first place, and wouldn’t necessarily act as a deterrent either. 

There needs to be a shift away from thinking purely with emotion, specifically anger. I’m sure people will say ‘but what if it happened to you, your child or your sibling etc’. Yes, I would be fucking angry, upset and every other emotion. That’s normal. People have the right to be angry, and I won’t attempt to take that away from them. Though people threatening violence and death does not help protect children. It moves the problem to a deeper, darker place where it festers, and cannot be helped. The conversation needs to be up in open, logical and lead to productive intervention before offending behaviour begins.",0,1585639278,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8hgh/pedophiles_need_help_not_persecution/,unpopularopinion,1

fs8git,kortanax,(Female Perspective) Girls *do* go for assholes,"Girls will say we don’t, we don’t like guys who are mean or dismissive of us. We like guys who are kind and considerate and show us effort. 

Let me say how untrue this is, and before I go into this **I’m not encouraging anyone to be dicks to girls or to stop being a kind individual.**

I’m a girl in my mid-twenties, I’ve been around the block as a decent looking girl—I was raised my my older brother and my dad, I never had a female presence in my life to guide me or to shape my opinions. A lot of my life I believed I wasn’t as good looking as I apparently am, so I never really had standards in appearance for men, just how they treated me and themselves. 

 In college, I got plenty of male attention, lots of guys wanted to date me, but I was never interested. I’d hang out or hook up, but nobody really caught my attention and I didn’t want to be in a relationship like I had been in high school. Until I met my current boyfriend. 

I’m not going to lie and he wouldn’t protest this either, he was a dick to me. He was hot, he had muscles, he was popular, he was confident and he was very dismissive of me, he was never chivalrous to me (this all changed when we started dating), but it was his dismissiveness and his unwillingness to cater to me that actually made me more attracted to him. 

I remember one night we were walking and I was shivering and he had his big jacket and he looked at me and said, “sucks, should have brought a jacket.” Any self respecting woman wouldn’t stand for somebody so uncaring, right?

At the same exact time, I had guys offering to take me on dates, buying me concert tickets, wanting to meet my dad—but if anything their willingness to wait on me hand and foot turned me off. 

There’s something that most girls need and that’s validation and admiration. Lots of girls LOVE basking in this, but I think because of my low self esteem I was always uncomfortable with guys catering to me and trying to impress me. 

Something about *working* for validation and attention that made his attention and kindness so much more meaningful and attractive.",102,1585639146,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8git/female_perspective_girls_do_go_for_assholes/,unpopularopinion,1

fs8avz,SpaceGuyRob,I think the ps4 is overrated,"I am just making this because I am bored. I have made similar post to this before but this time I will be covering ps4 mostly as opposed to xbox or pc. I quite like Microsoft as a company, call me a fanboy or whatever but I have my reasons. I'm making this as it seems like a good continuation of my previous post and is somewhat relevant considering the new consoles are coming out.

&amp;#x200B;

To start this off I will bring up the first and most common reason why people say ps4 is better, the exclusives. Not only is this the most common point people bring up, but it's actually my main reason of disliking the ps4. The xbox has basically no exclusives, that is true, but this point is only works if you actually care about the ps4s exclusives, which I don't. I like god of war, but pretty much everything else I either dislike or I think is overhyped, uncharted? I tried every single one and disliked all of them, Spiderman? its ok, I like Spiderman games but wouldn't buy a whole console over it. never cared about horizon zero dawn and Detroit become human is barely a game.

If you like these exclusives and so you want a ps4 because of it, that's fine, but as someone who doesn't I will tell you that everything else beyond that seems very mediocre, or so I think. I do have experience with the console, having shared a room with someone who owned it as well as spending extended periods of time with people who own it, and while it certainly gets the job done, everything about it seemed so, lack luster. I like all the organization controls of the xbox ui in terms of my library and home page but on the ps4 it seemed like a rip off version of an old 360 UI. the controller is fine though I like the option on the xbox to be able to use whatever batteries I want, or using battery packs, along side the option to use the cable. 

Backwards compatibility is one of the best things on the xbox and I use it very frequently, without it games I missed I would've never played, games I want to look back on would be inaccessible. I like the community features on xbox, and I prefer the services such as gamepass. And the xbox mends well with my PC. the ps4 either lacks these things or does them worse, in my opinion. The console isn't bad, in fact I was intending to buy it when the guy I mentioned earlier moved out, I wanted to own both consoles but when the switch came out, and when xbox started getting the updates, I looked at them and thought that there really isn't any point to get a ps4 anymore, if I get a new console (minus the next xbox) it's going to be a switch.

That's really about it for now, comment what you will.

TL:DR: I don't like most PlayStation exclusives and everything else I don't really think is that good so I like xbox better.",11,1585638340,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs8avz/i_think_the_ps4_is_overrated/,unpopularopinion,1

fs89uw,Approximately400Bees,Dogs are so much better than cats can ever be.,"The whole ""dogs vs cats"" thing has been going on a while. I see posts where people are going ""oh cats aren't as bad as they seem, they do ______"", and I'm here to state my opinion that yes they fucking are. 

First off, cats are boring as hell. They walk around, lay there, sleep, do whatever the hell. You can't take them on walks, or to the park, or to play fetch in the yard, like dogs. They don't play like dogs. Yes they play, but not like dogs. Dogs actively want to play with you and make that known, cats ""playing"" are reactionary to things you do to entice them.

Cats can't protect you. They're small, weak, and relatively dumb compared to dogs. A cat can't protect you or your household from intruders or other sources of harm. They're simply not big or strong enough. It's not for their lack of trying, because they may WANT to protect you, they just physically can't. If I broke into a house and a cat ran at me, I'd just punt it out of the way and continue my business. It wouldn't scare me at all. And I know some of you are going to bring small dogs into this, but keep in mind that cats are all generally the same size. Dogs sizes range enormously.

Last point, cats are just assholes. They randomly knock shit off the counter, for no reason other than to watch it break. They claw up furniture even if they have a post to scratch. They tear up or attack any item that has odd movement, like a bag, feathers, strings, shoelaces, and countless other items. Cats torture their prey. They catch something, claw it, and let it go to chase it and watch it bleed. I've seen this with many cats. Cats are assholes on purpose.

Dogs are the superior choice, and there is nothing in hell or on Earth that can change my mind. Dogs are smarter, more useful, more playful, and even cuter than cats.

On top of that from what I’ve gathered there’s two types of antivaxxers: those who think the entire concept is garbage, and those that think that vaccines work but the creators of these vaccines put unnecessary additives in them, which is something that’s worth looking into.

The thing I need to get across to people is when you go off on them and call them morons, that’s not going to change any bodies mind because they see you as somebody who’s a “sheep”. 

My final point, a lot of you like to say things like “you’re putting us all in danger when you don’t get your kids vaccinated” how exactly does that make sense to you? If you or your kid is vaccinated then neither of you are in any danger, that’s kind of the point of a vaccine, by doing this you’re saying that the vaccine doesn’t work and that makes you both anti-vax.",0,1585637483,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs84uz/people_are_way_too_harsh_against_antivaxxers/,unpopularopinion,1

It's also important to know that you don't know any facts, and thus knowing that your opinion doesn't matter. 

I came across an interesting quote by Hannah Arendt, ""freedom of opinion is a farce unless factual information is guaranteed and the facts themselves are not in dispute."" 

Enforcing an opinion with emotion is not a problem, unless the person does not have confidence they know factual information. An opinion enforced emotionally has a longer and stronger effect on people, and it's dangerous to do that if they don't know what they're talking about. The problem is that someone may believe they know enough to make a valid opinion on something, but very often, they don't. 

The problem is that other people may believe them. It's scary. If someone has a wrong opinion on something, you wonder where they got that from and who they are saying it to.

fs7vts,Jersey0001,"We should emphasize more to keep a safe distance when talking, than to wash the hands","We all know that washing the hands its important. But not everybody knows that in reality is because it lowers the possibility of having the virus; not that prevents you from having it. When you talk, small particles of saliva comes off your mouth, and if the other person in sick, you will catch the virus if one of the saliva particles makes contact with your mouth, eyes, or nose. Why washing the hands? Its not because you get sick if you touch the virus; its because if you touch your eyes, nose or mouth, and by coincidence, you have that virus on your hands, you will get sick. But, the reality is that if you wash your hands a million times, (even if you cut your hands off) you would get the virus if you don't keep a safe distance, at least 6 feet (2 meters) from people when talking. Even if they are not talking, because if by coincidence, if the person talks at the same time you are passing, and the person is sick, you might get the virus. 

So all the heathcare agencies, and governments should emphasize more on keeping a safe distance (at least 6 ft or 2 m) when talking than other measures. Yes, those other measures are also important, but the priority is to defeat the main source of the infestation: avoiding saliva particles to make contact with your mouth, eyes, or nose.

This should be the guidelines: 

1) Keep safe distance when talking, at least 6 feet (2 meters)

2) Social distance (includes staying home if you don't need to go out to work or to buy essentials)

3) Wash your hands (at least 20 seconds) before and after picking your nose, and before eating.

4) Wash your hands regularly (because unconsciously, you can touch your eyes, nose or mouth)

5) disinfect high touch areas",0,1585636176,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs7vts/we_should_emphasize_more_to_keep_a_safe_distance/,unpopularopinion,1

i actually recently started using cuticle clippers to trim them to the same length i always do and it did a very nice job, so i think i might keep on doing that since it eliminates the possibility that the nail can keep on tearing to the side, which is annoying and painful, although doesn't happen too frequently. they'll stay the same length and probably look identical, the only difference is that i'll be using a tool instead of my teeth. i expect that if i told people that i trim them short with cuticle clippers, i'd get a friendlier response than if i said i bite them, even though they look the same either way. i think the negative reactions aren't so much about how short they are, it's the idea that trimming them with your teeth is somehow filthy, even if the results are identical either way, regardless of the fact that i wash my hands just as frequently as anyone else does, or maybe even more frequently than the average person does.",21,1585634714,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs7lhs/i_bite_my_nails_i_dont_care_what_you_think_and_i/,unpopularopinion,1

So me being a guy that gives into peer pressure really easily, I had to try it (heck I'm a jojo fan).
I grabbed everything I needed towel, phone, lotion. I found some really hot hentai on r/DDLCrule34 and went to work. About 3 minutes later I had a full erection and decided it was time to apply the lotion. I grabbed the bottle with my left hand and squirted it in my right hand. I slapped the glob of lotion on my dick and went back to work. However while the lotion was on my dick I could feel it enter my dick hole, a somewhat uncomfortable feeling. I still was still gonna jerk though. About 3 minutes later the lotion started getting sticky, making it harder to jerk, and it wasn't fun anymore. I didnt even cum.

This is basically my weakly-written, main discussion on why. It should just be the entire post, but very well. *For one,* it’s an important religious figure for Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. Actually, it’s still used today for monasteries and the such. This could be taken the wrong way by somebody who’s never known the true meaning. Besides traditional religions, it’s used in newer religions even after the Second World War, such the Raëlin movement and Ananda Marga. After the religions, there are the meanings where most of us live, the place I’ve said about five times before and will say five times again, the Western world. It was used to symbolize auspiciousness and good luck. The swastika was widely used, and was utilized on designs to hopefully bring good luck to them in the future.

fs7655,Die_GoXD,My culture/heritage/country is not important to me,"This is an opinion that I've had since I was a teenager and nothing ever came along that would make me change my mind in this regard. 

I don't care much for my culture, at least, not more than for other cultures. I suppose because I was exposed to it my whole life, I see it as mundane. Which is why I tend to find other cultures more fascinating, as I haven't been to many of them.

I'm on the same boat with my country (Venezuela). I left it 5 years ago and the only thing I missed about it were my friends, whom all have left to Argentina so I have zero reason to return. Even if the country were to somehow improve overnight, I still wouldn't go back since there's no point. Again, I'm much more interested in seeing my friends again or seeing other countries I've never been to. 

And my heritage is something I'm adamant in not learning anything about. I've never understood people's fascination with something so trivial. Who my ancestors were is irrelevant to who I am. They're dead, I'm not.

But based on my family (my brother has a tattoo of our country on his arm) and a majority of people, it appears I'm alone in this, as sometimes I've been criticized of not acting/sounding like a Venezuelan. Heck, I want to get a tattoo based on Norse mythology and my co-worker (who is also Latino) asked why would I get a tattoo like that and why not something more representative of my heritage/culture. When I told him its because I'm fascinated with Vikings, his reaction was along the lines of ""well, whatever.""

I grew up in a Christian conservative home. When I came out, my parents got hurt and said very negative things although ultimately they reassured their love for me. I love them, but from a distance. I recently came out to a friend who I grew up with and I still feel like if I say something even remotely gay, he would get upset. Coworkers are a different story. I see them every day. A lot of them are older traditionally conservative/religious people and I keep good relationships, but I am still closeted and lie every time they ask if I’m married or have a girlfriend (I’m in LGBT-friendly California btw). 

As a gay person, it’s extremely difficult and stressful to be close with someone who likes you but doesn’t fully value your authenticity even though they don’t mean any ill will. Questions arise in my mind asking: Will they come to my wedding if that day ever comes? Will my parents want to meet my significant other or even want to know his name? 

I reached out and found a friend, and then I met his friends. For the first time, I have never been so comfortable being open with myself with all of the new friends that I met. 

It’s important to put yourself first, no matter how painful leaving some people behind may be. Even if it means being alone. Deciding not to be close with people I feel I can’t be open with doesn’t mean they are my enemies.

This isn't some hardware/software issue with my phone, either, as it happens on every smartphone I use.

I also have a Galaxy S7 and they have these two bullshit touch icons on the bottom corners of the phone that I always touch with the base of my hand whenever I'm using my phone that just inconveniences the hell out of me.

fs7272,Zycon_X,"Parents, your child is not a genius, everybody else, kids aren't stupid.","Children, particularly those under 13 years of age aren't at a point in their development where their inteligence can even be effectively judged, especially by those with a bias one way or another.

The honest truth is that children are simply inexperienced, in DnD terms a child is a level zero character, yes they may appear smart when they figure something out for the first time or stupid whenever they do something like run into traffic. However this is only a reflection of their lack of experience. If anything any perceived inteligence is a reflection of their learned skills, just as with all of us. So whenever your co-worker says, ""My baby is so smart!"" what they are actually saying is ""Aren't I such a good teacher... please validate my skills."" and vice versa. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just communicate this without involving the child. Just spend time with your kids sometimes and don't assume their inteligence one way or the other... they might just surprise you. and maybe ask your partner if you're doing a good job instead of boldly proclaiming your 3 month old's genius.  


The reverse is just as bad though, I've heard so many people claiming that someone's kids are stupid. But they probably don't even know better. How about instead of mocking a child behind their back if instead you just say to their parent, ""I think you should spend a bit more time with your kid... they were doing this dangerous thing and they could really use your help."" Sure actually addressing the issue might make a parent upset... but you know what would probably make them a lot more upset? Having to take their child to the hospital because some but-head was busy laughing at the three year old as they tried to electrocute them self instead of being a good person. If they (the parent) still don't do anything then you have the responsibility to let someone in a higher position of authority know what's going on.  


And hey, if it's not dangerous, why should you care?

fs6ykg,Superscifi123,"Celeste is an ok game, but not a masterpiece or GOTY contender.","Coming from someone who’s been a gamer their whole life, I’m not really sure what to say. I can kind of see why people love it so much but on the other hand... it’s just a 2-D platformer with some cool and some annoying mechanics, with an above average story and great soundtrack. Visuals are ok sometimes but it IS pixel art, the most played out art style in these kinds of games, like Fez or Out There Somewhere. But wow, some people wanted it to be GOTY? I just don’t see it. It’s fine I guess.

Now, I post this here because I really hope that people don’t just say “you’re bad lol.” Like my friends have. I got to the mountain part and was told to go back and beat b-sides, which at first I thought was interesting. However, I noticed it was just old levels with more spikes / more precision needed, and I was just fed up with it. So yes, I didn’t finish the game all the way. But I played more than enough to know my opinion on it. I also went out of my way to collect strawberries but, as far as I know my friend who has beaten the game (and loves it) says even he was disappointed by how little they mattered, which really killed me even more.

From a story perspective, without spoilers, I like it. I can relate to an extent and reading the dialogue was one of the most fun parts of the game, in a good and bad way. The music is actually really solid, like very very solid. I would consider the soundtrack the highlight of the game for me.

The thing that gets me is I love platformers, 3-D and 2-D. BoxBoy is a nice game that I enjoyed a lot, and I liked a lot of the 2-D platformers I’ve played. But not this one. I’m really struggling to see both why I really don’t like it and why other people like it. I think part of the issue is that a dash is one of the most generic mechanics you can have in this sort of game. I’ll concede that it’s used creatively, like with the boxes you dash into to make them travel. But some things are just pure uncreative. While usually not a main focus, the green crystal is quite lame and the feather really highlighted this for me. I mean, Doom eternal, A 3-D FPS has the same dash mechanic and crystal. The feather is honestly just lame. I don’t really have much to say about it.

Difficulty, the game for sure has hard enough content to warrant practice. But unlike games like Furi or Dark Souls I didn’t usually feel achievement in doing these. It might be because I died far more times and learned far less, along with just being much more bored with the lackluster mechanics. Beating a boss in dark souls or Furi, or hell, even hard levels in easier games like Mario Oddessy was very fulfilling. As a completionist I expected that same reaction from beating my first (and last) B-Side, there just wasn’t any.

However, I will say that I do not hate this game. The part where you’re climbing the mountain with your purple hair, coming to terms with who seems to be the manifestation of anxiety, is pretty great and honestly, what I expected from the majority of the game. And the soundtrack is incredible. To an extent I’m annoyed at how popular it became, but it’s not too bad as the game has at least a good message.  

To end, I gotta know what separates this game from other 2-D plats. If anyone could tell me, I’d appreciate it, I just don’t see it at all. The game is ok to me.",3,1585631583,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs6ykg/celeste_is_an_ok_game_but_not_a_masterpiece_or/,unpopularopinion,1

fs6y8i,Anthonybrose,"If you believe that the possibility of a zombie apocalypse could happen, you are an idiot who knows nothing about the human body.","Lets first go over what happens when a zombie (bites) you. 

1. It takes a lot of force to break skin in the first place.
2. How is the virus transmitted? Zombies are incapable of creating salvia. Their blood would be coagulated by this point, so they woildn't really bleed either.

By this point you are infected somehow and the virus does the absolute worst thing it can do, which is kill its host. Because now, even if the brain restarts, the rest of the body is dead.

1. Your blood coagulates and is unable to bring much needed blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs 
2. All of your organs shrivel up and die.
3. Since your lungs are all shriveled up, you would be unable to speak or breath.
4. Your esophagus and stomach would be shriveled up and closed, so you would not be hungry and would not want to eat other people.
5. Even if you managed to eat meat, where would it go? It's
 not like zombies bowel systems work.

fs6xkz,Lavi1011,Dating for men really sucks.....,"As long sex is an achievement for men unlike woman, dating is always going to be hunted and hunter.


My friends have been living 24 years without having a relationship and they aren't bad looking.
As a man one actually need to consistently try and risk being denied, having enough courage ask a girl out is something most men would have difficulty doing , and once you manage to. You risk getting denied which completely destroys your self esteem.
Ive been denied countless amount of times thats the only reason i managed to have relationship since i didn't miss 100 percent of the shots i didnt take.
But i would lie if i said it didn't hurt like hell when i got denied and quetioned my self esteem for long periods. Frankly i find myself above average on looks not that it bloody matters because as long you dont look like an Egyptian god dating will slap you hard.

Now to add fuel to the fire, society wont ever compliment you because you're a boy. Unless you are really handsome you won't get called out alot. Girls get complimented all the time
Good luck getting confident


And then you get such huge ""competition"" (, the statistics are there, hell the ratio between men/women on dating sites is 3:1 and frankly real life isnt any different) girls get picky, rightfully so. I mean
Wouldn't you? Assuming you could ""choose""? And boys lower their standard , they lower themselves so much to a point There's a whole subreddit on ""nice guys"" .There's such high demand of straight porn for men , having sex is even considered an achievement!
These are all core problems of dating god damn it. Of course girls like confidence as it is so rare because dating is utter garbage.

I personally learnt how to accept being denied with dignity and try again, which is why today it wont be an issue for me to find a girl.
But ive been through so much shit and issues to reach this state it's not supposed to be like that

And if it is, then *** equality.",1,1585631439,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs6xkz/dating_for_men_really_sucks/,unpopularopinion,1
fs6xhz,crikeym8te,I don’t like Joe Exotic or any of the other big cat sanctuary people due to their abuse of animals.,"This is probably gonna get hella downvoted but oh well. 

First off, yes, out of the bunch Joe is way more mild and his crimes do not near match Carol, who probably did murder her husband, and Doc is a disgusting groomer (and should be looked into more??) also yes Joe is funny and kind of a nut which makes him likable, but here’s my problem. 

I am really annoyed at how many people are over looking how these big cats are getting mistreated. 

I live in OKC and refused for many years to go the Joe’s park for many reasons. The biggest being allowing people to pet cubs. They’re snatched away from their mothers at such a young age and shoved into the arms of the public unaware and scared. If you ever have watched any real science based wildlife programs you know you don’t touch the cubs. It’s better for them to stay “wild” and not interact with people. I know it’s tempting to want to cuddle with something so powerful yet cute but it’s not right. A lot of cubs that are handled at such a young age go right into the canned hunting regime since they become desensitized to humans. We all hate those idiots who have lion head mounted over their fireplace.

Also not to mention the videos and investigations the humane society has conducted on G.W park? How can people stand behind someone who flippantly breeds different species of big cats and sells them to the black market? I thought we had all agreed that was not right and focus on conservation rather than exploitation? 

Sorry just my two cents it’s very frustrating to me that he’s getting all this positive attention. I’m hoping this doesn’t encourage people to create their own roadside zoos and exploit these animals.

fs6wfk,Dragonsbreath67,We may be entering a new video game depression/crash,"This from a gamer who has been playing video games since he was 2 in 2000. Every gamer knows the story of how ET eviscerated Atari and it lead to the great video game crash. I think that's coming again. I think we are on the brink of a new video gaming depression/crash. Video games had a golden age in the 2000s to early 2010s. Then the powers that be at EA came along and decided to snap up once beloved studios who made popular and well received games and milk their properties dry, make shitty new releases that lack all the magic the original studios brought to the table, and add in a endless wave of Microtransactions, ingame purchases, subscription services, and lootboxes. 

We dismissed this as EA just getting greedy, but soon more studios began following this trend. Stopping caring about fans, running beloved properties into the ground,  not giving fans what they want, and flaunting their greed. The mobile game developer Gameloft is another good example. They used to be one of a kind on the Itunes Appstore. They made small rpg games for mobile, that didn't have inapp purchases. 

Sure they weren't cheap for mobile games but it felt like a pc or console gaming experience. Then they stopped updating those games and took them off the store then released a onslaught of those shitty games where you have to spend hundreds of dollars to do anything without waiting months to get anywhere. EA also jumped on that bandwagon. 

Again we dismissed this as a isolated incident. Then the unthinkable happened. Bethesda game studios ruined fallout. They made mistake after mistake after mistake, including doxxing all their players, lying to players, and adding in the endless microtransactions and lootboxes and the dreaded subscription service. 

Ubisoft next fell to the greed curse, adding in special rewards for paying players, a ingame currency, and even no longer releasing their games on steam anymore so people are forced to directly give them money. 

The Creative Assembly is next. First they made a warhammer series no one asked for. They released way more dlc then usual for it. Now they have completely stopped caring about the only historical title they have announced in a while after 4 successful bad and mediocre games. All these studios knew what we wanted but they didn't care. They just wanted to line their pockets. 

People really wanted half life 3 but valve chose to work with Steam 100% because it makes them all their money. 

I fear that as more and more game studios fall to greed and stopping caring about their fanbase, it may ruin the entire gaming industry irreparably.",4,1585631291,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs6wfk/we_may_be_entering_a_new_video_game/,unpopularopinion,1
fs6vvv,GR3YM4N14,Preppers and Buggers are the only people who got their shit together when it comes to family.,"Hear me out. 

I know most people think Preppers and Buggers are tinfoil conspiracy theorists. 

And there’s people like out there but most of us/them are regular people who do a bit extra for the worst possible situations. 

I don’t know how to explain it, you see all these well off people saying they care about and love their families so much but yet, they can’t sacrifice for them and be prepared for an emergency. 

Prepping and Bugging is expensive to start (the more family members the more expensive the start up) but it’s a sacrifice. 

For me that meant no “fun money” for 4 months. After that though you only make small sacrifices and investments every couple weeks/shopping trips. 

Seeing how preppers and buggers sacrifice “fun money” for their families well being shows that they care more about something that could endanger or threaten their family than someone who says “we’ll be fine”. 


If people really cared about family, they would stop constantly living in the moment or past and instead look to the future and what could be a threat or obstacle for their family in the future. 


So yeah, if you can’t invest in emergency supplies because of how you think people will see you and because you think it’s not important, you can’t love your family that much after all.",10,1585631218,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs6vvv/preppers_and_buggers_are_the_only_people_who_got/,unpopularopinion,1

fs6nf9,whatsyoizm,current popular gay representation sucks,"This is a rant I've been thinking of since I started reading the book that Love, Simon is based off of and let me just say.. the ""not like other gays"" type is just as bad as the ""queen"" stereotype. When I say the ""not like other gays"" stereotype this usually occurs in coming of age stories where the character has never really experienced feelings for guys before but the problem for me comes in the way that they are very heteronormative and often explicitly separate themselves from the ""queen"" stereotype and sometimes it seems like internalized homophobia? What I mean by this is characters like this often have lines about never having heard a Madonna song or having seen a Judy Garland movie and act like that means they won't fit in with other gays which I get the thought behind it but it's such a prominent trope in coming of age stories and I hate it just as much as I hate the effeminate, loud, sassy stereotype. It damages any sense of community a reader feels like they could get with the LGBTQ+ community and now, it's not a community for everyone but to almost drive home the idea that if you're not like the stereotype you don't really fit in is not something that should be in movies championed by the general public. In these stories too, the main character 90% of the time only ends up having some sort of relationship with the love interest who is similar to them. There's never a friendship they form with someone else who is LGBTQ+ and might be slightly different from them and the movies that do have this don't get pushed as hard as a Love, Simon. I personally think that the ""not like other gays"" trope only really promotes heteronormativity and assimilation by purposely distancing them from any other gay character there may or may not be in the book (except the love interest).

fs6dbp,DenTheRedditBoi7,"In competitive shooter games, you shouldn't be able to adjust your aim sensitivity.","We've all been there. We're playing Overwatch, Call Of Duty, or whatever your favorite shooter may be and you get sniped out of nowhere. You see the kill cam and it looks like it's having a seizure. The enemy has obviously tweaked their settings to better fit them. I don't think they should be able to do this for two main reasons.

I. It takes challenge out of the game for people who change it. In most games, you get better by putting in time and learning your weapon/character. There shouldn't be an easiness meter in every game. It's obvious that tweaking the sensitivity makes certain playstyles in games easier, but in a competitive game, you should have to *learn* a weapon, not just alter the settings of the game so it suits you.

II. They were set how they are for a reason. Most of the time, default sensitivities were set with balance in mind. Snipers aim slower, pistols are fast, etc., and changing the sensitivity yeets that out of the window. You suddenly gain an advantage over people who haven't changed this setting, which some players may not even know how to. It's destroying a part of the balance.

I think players should have to adapt to the tools they are given in a competitive game. They shouldn't be able to change a setting and make it easier. Default sensitivities were often set with balance in mind, and it's annoying that some players throw that balance off by changing sensitivity.",55,1585628887,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs6dbp/in_competitive_shooter_games_you_shouldnt_be_able/,unpopularopinion,1

When they show important announcements, whether live or not, it's required by our law to include sign language interpreters, which sometimes take up HALF of the TV screen while the other half is the person speaking the announcement. 

Personally, this is very distracting to me because I always end up paying attention to the interpreter instead of the announcements, particularly interested how the hell they are always able to keep up with a very fast speaking pace and translate very random words.

fs68ez,Stanchthrone480,Desktop PCs and laptops are fundamentally better than consoles.,"So apparently this is pretty unpopular. Title says it all. I have a few points to present. 

1. Methods of obtaining. PC's can be built from scratch, just needing a couple of tutorials and the parts necessary to build. However, people can't build consoles. They need to rely on bigger manufacturers, like Microsoft and Sony to build them and release them. 
2. Cost of maintaining. For a PC that costs 500 dollars, you can do pretty decently, with around medium quality on most games with more than 60 fps. You could also build a really cheap computer, like for around 200 dollars, and use Nvidia's Geforce Now to stream games for cheap and good performance. However, on consoles, the hardware is not strong enough to go over 60 fps, and when cranking the settings up higher they have a hard time producing the frames to output to the monitor (although next-gen consoles like the Xbox Series X claim to remedy that issue). Console games are made to use lower detail. Additionally, on consoles to play with others you need to pay a subscription, like Xbox Live. With a PC, you don't need to do that. On PC, there are more sales, and thus most games are cheaper. Sure, on Xbox there are some free games, but the free games on PC outnumber the ones on Xbox. 
3. More freedom to upgrade. You can't upgrade a console, because the parts used are custom made, and don't fit any standards. You cannot plug PC parts into consoles, and while there are some modifications to consoles, like the one that allows you to run android on a Nintendo Switch, There isn't much. On a PC, if you want to change something, or upgrade to a better part, simply by the part, open the case, and then unscrew the part you want to replace and add the new one in. Connect the cable, and you are done. 
4. More customization. This ties back into the ""more freedom to upgrade"", because things like custom water cooling with lighting and custom sleeved cables and even internal displays are not available on consoles, while they exist on PCs. 
5. More activities. Sure, it may be nice to be able to buy something specifically for gaming, but in a practical sense consoles do not really provide much use other than playing some games. Especially during this current ""human malware"" crisis, have you seen anyone say that they worked from home using their Xbox One? Everyone who is working from home, and for that matter, anywhere, uses computers. You can browse the web on a PC, but not on a console. (Yes, there are some modifications for consoles, but the experience is smoother on hardware made to support it.) 
6. More software. On consoles, if you are using an Xbox, you are using the proprietary Microsoft Xbox store for that. You cannot use another game launcher. For a PC, there is Steam, Blizzard, Epic Games, and if you want to count Roblox. 
7. Modifications to games. On Consoles, the support for modding games for games like GTA V or Minecraft is virtually non-existent. However, on the PC side of things, it's really easy to go search up ""Minecraft \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Mod"", and download. Really the only foreseeable downside to this is that people sometimes load up malware onto Mods, and then you have accidentally download malware onto you computer.     
8. Better aiming. Most people find it easier to compensate for the recoil of a gun firing with a mouse, because it feels more natural. Even moving the crosshairs, the sensitivity control is just much better on mouse and keyboard. This is why most Esports Pros are on PC, and not Console. 
9. You can play to your style. On console, there is not much support for customizing things like sensitivity. However, on PC, your mouse can be customized to the DPI (basically sensitivity) that your mouse runs at, so you can aim better. There are also analogue keyboards that sense how far you have pushed the key down, and it adjusts the input accordingly. People are now making keyboards and mice to work for consoles, like Razer's Turret for Xbox One. 
10. Monitors are generally better than TVs. When gaming on a console, most people use their TV. However, on desktops, you use monitors, because monitors generally have less imput latency, better response times, less ghosting, higher refresh rate, etc. There are also monitors called ultrawides that use a higher horizontal length, to allow the gamer to see farther in their field of view than other gamers. 
11.  Building your own gaming PC is more satisfying than purchasing some already built system mass produced by manufacturers. It's more fun, and you learn more along the way. You can also personalize it, to make it truly yours with custom lighting and color schemes.

If you wanted to do it anyway and just bring the kid along, sure thing, but I know a lot of new mothers that can’t wait to take their babies to all these big things and experiences....first of all they don’t care and can’t understand anything about the Grand Canyon. Splashing around in a backyard kiddy pool has the same excitement to them as taking them to a “swim with hippos” wildlife experience in South America. 

Nothing pisses me off more than seeing pictures of me as a baby in cool places that I don’t remember, or hearing stories of “oh yeahhh, we took you to this thing...you were a baby though, probably too young too remember.” That’s right. Babies don’t care then but very likely might after they grow up. Take your little kids to smaller things and save the money for when they’re at least toddlers and can remember meeting Jack Sparrow or petting an endangered bird at the top of a sacred Japanese mountain. 


If you can at least afford to bring them back to something after they’re older than babies, that’s cool. But I still don’t see the point of bringing small humans with mushy brains to huge events (unless you were already going for yourself) and then telling them after the fact that they did so many cool things and traveled to cool places that they don’t remember.

fs62l2,oke_doke_poke_mon,"If men watch porn, their girlfriends should be able to post it","Oooh, this is going to be wildly unpopular but hear me out. As long as the caveat is no personal contact or texting, if one partner is constantly viewing and jerking off to other people’s girlfriends, his own should also be able to post herself for others to jerk off to. If the man doesn’t text the girls, and if the girl doesn’t text the “fans” or invite personal contact, then the situations are equal in my eyes. Women are not personal property, so if you’re not going to be “mentally monogamous” than neither should she have to be. I realize that porn is entirely normal and acceptable, but who do you think the girls on the other side of the screen are? If scrolling thousands of naked daughters, mothers, college students, wives, and girlfriends is to be considered normal, it should be equally normal for a girl to continue/be able to post herself for other men like yourself to enjoy while in a relationship. I always hear that porn “doesn’t mean anything” right, so as I said, if there’s no personal contact involved what’s the harm? This shouldn’t be a situation that you’re okay with every other woman doing for your benefit, except your woman. Men like tits, that’s okay, women may like posting their tits and getting the same validation her boyfriend gives over women, and that should be okay too.

Appreciate what is being given. Why react so negativity. Zuckerberg has given away almost 2 billion dollars on various donations and is trying to donate 1 billion a year for other charities. 

Bill gates has given 34 billion dollars total to charities. They don't just dumb all their money in one charity... 

Also net worth is different than cash on hand. Just because someone has a net worth of 100 billion dollars doesn't mean they have that much money. Assets, stocks etc make that up. 

People like to be so damn negative all the time... 

Yes billionaires shouldn't exist fine. Sure. But...

Why be a prick about them giving large amounts of cash to charities and research?

fs5v25,YankeeDoodleDanke,Being a landlord and cancelling rent payments is not a heroic thing.," 

Chances are if you are a landlord extending credit to your tenants, it's because you yourself are being allowed to defer payments on your own loans. The economy's freezing ripples throughout society and impacts everyone in some way. Everyone is broke, even without their net worth changing a dime.

Still skeptical? Let's talk about the reciprocal side of the debtor-creditor agreement: collateral.

I have seen dozens upon dozens of concerned people freaking out about not working (which I understand) because ""I can lose my house, my car, go to jail"" etc.. But that's simply not realistic right now. Imagine that tomorrow 7 million people will stop making their car payments. Under *normal* circumstances, someone would repossess your car. But who is going to repossess seven million cars? Nobody. Nobody has the resources to do that. No top-down order for police officers to mass-evict one-third of the country is going to manifest. Even if someone really did want that to happen, it would be a huge waste of resources for the enforcer/creditor in each case and the costs would outweigh the benefits, especially considering that they should expect their payments to resume as normal once the pandemic subsides.

If you have bills that you can't pay, *don't pay them*. And also, *communicate with your creditors*. There is frankly nothing that anyone can do about it, and it's not like it's going to come as a huge shock to landlords and utility companies. I suspect that there will be modifications to the law to ensure that legal recourse won't exist for people what want to extort you for collateral. Countries have already begun extending periods of eviction banning, student debt compounding has been paused, and companies are giving away free versions of everything. You want to know why they're giving away stuff for free? Because these companies don't have to pay their interest or salary expenses. Nobody has to pay anything, because everybody understands that *nobody has any money*.

People seem to forget that social distancing is a bottom-up freeze of business that affects everyone. It is not just unemployed service laborers that cannot pay their bills. Proprietorships can't pay their bills, landlords can't pay their bills, and corporations likely also cannot pay their bills; *everyone's* means of income has essentially been turned off. This recession is completely uncomfortable, but things should theoretically return to normal once the health crisis causing it subsides.",4,1585626698,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs5v25/being_a_landlord_and_cancelling_rent_payments_is/,unpopularopinion,1

Sometimes that can be the goal, but usually it's not. 

I see this a lot with nature photography and I know that with a lot of nature photographs the goal is to create a certain mood or aesthetic within the image, not to simply capture just exactly what the eye originally saw. I understand being frustrated when travel ads are edited and possibly deceiving, but photographers posting their pretty pictures on the internet should not be held to the standard of naturalism. 

Yes, turning all the saturation sliders up can be ugly, and I'm not talking about that. I've just seen a lot of genuinely very gorgeous and well shot images get trashed on for being edited to be ""deceiving"" when the goal of the image probably wasn't to advertise in the first place. Photography is still an *art* form. Editing to get the emotional and visual tone that you want is part of that art! If someone wants to turn the warmth up in an image to create something with a sense of comfort and glow, and that in turn alters the natural colors, then that's okay!

Or, since that's a lot of effort and maybe you think people are dumb, you could just teach them that there's a god and it wants you to live a certain way. There's also no reason this couldn't work with something less traditional.

fs515k,superbudda494,I'm thrilled that the markets are crashing,"My girlfriend and I have been waiting for the markets to crash for some time now. Pretty much since the first instance of the yield curve inverting last year. 

In the United States, we have a terrifying system built around growth for growth's sake. Companies are highly incentivized to reinvest all if their profits. Mostly so that they don't have to pay taxes. Look at Amazon. Not only this, but instead of paying cash for their investments, why not issue corporate bonds? Let's issue a bunch of investment-grade vehicles that will lose their ratings the moment something bad happens. Looking at you BBB-rates bonds.

Growth periods go through natural cycles of ups and downs. But we have had a record bull run for damn near 10 years. The bigger that bubble, the worse the crash. I'm honestly disappointed that so many companies are receiving bailouts. I believe the bulk of the assistance should go to the small-businesses and individual citizens. Let Wall Street and the major corporations sweat. Otherwise they'll learn that if things ever go wrong, they'll just get bailed out.

Not much different than that friend you had in college with rich parents that made all the wrong decisions but always got a check from their parents. Then the parents are surprised when the kid never learns better. 

I'm glad it happened sooner than later. Because it was bound to happen sometime.",29,1585623216,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs515k/im_thrilled_that_the_markets_are_crashing/,unpopularopinion,1

fs50ig,_comfortablydumb_,Season 3 of Stranger Things is a huge disappointment for multiple reasons,"I've been thinking about it a lot, and despite the generally positive reviews, I believe that ST3 is a HUGE step down from seasons 1 and 2 in many ways. Here's my thoughts:

1. ***They took away the small-town relatability that made seasons 1 and 2 scary in the first place.*** This is my main gripe about the third season. Even if a majority of the viewers haven't had the experience of a loved one going missing, they CAN put themselves in Joyce's shoes and feel that horror and unease that Winona Ryder portrays so spectacularly throughout both seasons (but mainly the first). While season 2 doesn't deal with Will's disappearance, he is basically possessed, which plays into the fear of watching a loved one's health decay and having no say in how they turn out. Then there's the omnipresent fear across both seasons of a powerful, malevolent government that's working behind citizens' backs. The combination of these factors makes for an intensely RELATABLE two seasons, in which the viewer can truly imagine themselves in the shoes of the main characters. This is true horror. 
2. ***Many of the characters' actions were outside the realm of plausibility.*** When it comes to fantasy and sci-fi media, magic and powers are a given, and a character (or more) with superhuman abilities is often integrated in with the rest of the cast. Fantasy and sci-fi media also portrays disadvantaged characters rising up against some sort of villain. Stranger Things is no different--Eleven has telekinesis, and across all three seasons, the majority of the fighting force against the government and the Upside Down are the kids. However, in seasons 1 and 2, everything the kids do (Eleven included) is plausible and realistic. (Realism is obviously to an extent, as we suspend our disbelief when it comes to Eleven's powers.) The kids' fighting abilities aren't out of the realm of possibility for what a kid could accomplish: the boys use the slingshots in s1, which are generally ineffective. This makes sense, because four 11-year-olds probably wouldn't have huge weapons--if they did, it would be stupid and unrealistic. Across both seasons, even once the older teens are incorporated into the fighting, the battles and general thwarting of evil is still very watchable--the characters have blunders, which is expected given their age and physical strength. Aside from her powers, Eleven doesn't demonstrate extreme strength: she breaks down emotionally, is mentally unstable at times, and behaves like a NORMAL TEENAGER. But the events of season 3 are just extremely unrealistic. You can't expect me to believe that four teenagers (fine, three teenagers and one preteen) are capable of breaking into a Russian base a MILE underground and coming out relatively unscathed, with NO LASTING REPERCUSSIONS (as if the Soviet army was stupid and disorganized???). It pulls you out of the story.
3. ***They destroyed previous relationships and made many of the characters one-dimensional.*** One of the biggest tragedies in the entire show wasn't a death, it was Mike's LOSS OF PERSONALITY. In the first two seasons, I liked a Mike a lot. He was the leader of the group. He showed a full range of emotions, his attachment to both El and his friends was VERY believable and he was overall just a very realistic character that was enjoyable to watch onscreen. But in season 3, what happened? They reduced him to nothing but a horny 14-year-old whose entire personality is his girlfriend. Lucas suffered the same fate, and as for Will, his role was reduced to touching his neck and ""H-he's back!"" All of these characters were so pivotal in the first two seasons, but it seems as if they were shunned to the side to make room for new characters and their developments. The gang was split up, with Dustin going off with a new group (that had absolutely NO chemistry). They had a mediocre hug at the end, but it wasn't enough to make up for the entire season. Hopper basically became a dick, and his ""flirting"" with Joyce was borderline abusive. They had him constantly trying to control El and police her decisions, something that's initially problematic to begin with and I got extremely tired of seeing after about 15 minutes.
4. ***It was such a crowd-pleaser.*** Once you start pandering to the audience's wants, you stop making art, and you start entertaining. This was such--why did Dustin need a girlfriend???? Just why??? She served absolutely no purpose except to sing a three-minute earsplittingly horrible song with him that directly cost the ""lives"" of several characters (I'm not including Hopper because clearly, he's alive). I'm not lying when I say that was the worst moment in cinema or TV I've ever seen, Shark Tale included. Dustin could have easily gone without a girlfriend, and it seemed like the first several episodes were just pandering to the shippers--endless footage of Mike/El, Nancy/Jonathan, and what the FUCK was up with Billy and Karen??? It was so unnecessary and just straight up boring to watch. 

I still consider myself a Stranger Things fan, but I've limited myself to only rewatching s1 and s2.",5,1585623146,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs50ig/season_3_of_stranger_things_is_a_huge/,unpopularopinion,1

fs4ojt,d0ct0rwh0b0y,In my opinion I believe that rap music is overrated,"         Hey reddit community! STOP! before I get blasted into downvote, or fuming comment Hades, I would like to say something, Contrary to what I posted and took down earlier... I’m sorry for my unintelligible argument and witless commentary... I do believe that rap music is truly music! Even though general basic rap lacks certain beautiful qualities that some music contains, I sincerely am of the opinion that it is music. I am saying however that it is overrated. I do not say all kinds of rap music, for that would be wrong. However a lot of rap music contains racy themes, inappropriate language and common themes of treating women like meat. I am saying though THIS IS NOT ALL RAP MUSIC! But the rap music that deals with these themes is the more popular and listened to kind. I am taking this statistic from what I have heard on the radio, read from statistical analyses, and heard peers and people around me  playing it or vocalizing it. I understand that you redditors will scream,” you don’t have to listen if you don’t like what it’s saying” Yes I understand that fact completely, however, rap music seems to be taking over the music world through the use of apps like Tik Tok, car radio channels and music apps. I know that you will screech through gritted teeth,” well you just don’t have to listen to those channels, or download those apps!” But the more popular it becomes the more one will hear it in daily life. Again I am arguing that not all rap music contains thematic, inappropriate elements. I am in the opinion that it is overrated! I wish that underrated music like folk, indie, blues, jazz, and instrumental music were more listened to by everyday people. I shall  reiterate my points so that you all might not get a meaning in which I did not intend.
1) Rap music is overrated.
2) The type of rap that is emerging and becoming popularized has racy inappropriate themes.
3) I do sincerely believe that rap music is indeed a genre of music
4) I wish that underrated, less listened to music was more popular.

fs4hms,IsThisOneTakenFfs,Xiaomi devices suck,"I have had unfortunately bad experience with Xiaomi devices and I am writing this from a Xiaomi Mi 5X (Also known as A1 I think) 

I've also had a  Mi Band 2. 
They are the perfect example of short term good usage. The phone is a cheap knock-off of Android and Apple put together (I can't see a lot of fonts and emojis on it), it keeps lagging (some features don't work, like when it says ""continue this action using...[apps here], they don't open), the volume button stopped working within a few months of use. The storage features are atrocious, especially the cloud feature.

Once the storage reaches the limit, the camera is basically fucking useless. The quality dropped to a new low within a year of use. 

The band turned out to be complete crap, because it ran out of battery extremely fast (even when I wasn't using the Bluetooth) and charged tremendously slow. After some time, the display went completely dead and there was no way of fixing it other than buying the new model (band 3 I think) 

So my advice to everyone: please don't buy Xiaomi devices. Save yourself from this hell. And if you never intended to, you're a clever person.

To the people who like them: why? In fact, I've met few people who have the same complaints as me. Am I the unluckiest person or what?

fs45zt,theinspector5,PornHub is not responsible for what it's users put on the site,"After PornHub announced they were temporarily giving away free PornHub premium to users in Italy, and later everywhere else, as a gesture to make the current restrictions to daily life more bearable, I saw some Twitter warriors bring up PornHub's supposed crimes against women, namely the ""Girls Do Porn"" scandal and another case of a 15 year old girl in Florida who was kidnapped and forced to star in several porn videos, some of which can allegedly still be found on the site, and said that it is morally reprehensible for men to use PornHub because of this.

Here's the thing, PornHub is basically a porn version of YouTube, almost all the content is created either by users or by studios that have PornHub channels. As tragic and horrific both cases are, PornHub did not commit any sort of abuse or crime, PornHub users did. Blaming PornHub for either of these atrocities against women and girls makes as much sense as blaming YouTube for the DaddyOFive couple being abusive to their kids or TMartn and Syndicate scamming their young viewers (not that that is ANYWHERE near what the PornHub controversies were). 

PornHub is also like YouTube in that they have a flagging system that can be used to bring their attention to abusive content when it arises, but some will always slip through the cracks, again just like on YouTube. If PornHub knowingly left up footage showing the rape of women and girls, that would be their fault, but they don't and responsibility lies entirely with the perpetrators, not the platform they misuse.",25,1585619825,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs45zt/pornhub_is_not_responsible_for_what_its_users_put/,unpopularopinion,1

fs44x4,PapaSlurms,Flattening the curve is going to be disastrous,"I really think this may not end well folks.  Here's why:

1)  We cannot simply borrow from the future for EVERYTHING, in order to stay home today.  This can only work for MAYBE 3-6 months.  It's too much money being generated out of thin air, and this will be what finally brings back that pesky inflation that central banks think is no more.

2)  People are already starting to go insane, and it's only been a couple weeks.  Imagine how stir crazy everyone is going to be by month 3, let alone 6.  At 6 months, all ""non-essential"" stores will be looted, and we can already see retailers beginning to board up stores now.

3) Choosing the emotionally driven solution of ""prevent deaths"", will lead to our entire society be torn apart at the very fabric through which it is weaved, money.  A homeless American still lives WAY better than a homeless African.  Same goes for the EU, and every other major fiat currency country.

4) People at jobs are replaceable (ultimately).

5) Fuck it, I'll say it...A global reset of the aging population would prove to be a long term blessing/miracle.  Think of how much cheaper healthcare costs would be if 40% of people over the age of 70 died.  

a)  Collateral damage is acceptable (younger people), as the mortality rate seems to be incredibly skewed towards higher age.

I am aware that dark humor involves joking about things you typically shouldn’t, and that the subject matter revolves around taboo items. 

I am all for freedom of speech, and think that nothing should be off-limits when it comes to humor (just know your community has the right to hold you accountable for your words).

However, with that being said, I am not a fan of a majority of the posts due to the overwhelming amount racist jokes/memes. I went to the subreddit hoping to find funny posts regarding things like mental health, suicide, pregnancy, gender roles, etc. I expected there to be some racist posts, but the amount of them is insane. 

And I understand that joking about race/ethnicity doesn’t necessarily make one a racist, but it does perpetuate racism—definitely not an ally-like behavior. A sprinkle of racist jokes here and there I could tolerate, but it is all the page seems to care about.

fs3yua,DarthFarris,There should be term limits on how long someone can be a police officer (at least in America),"Look, I see police officers as community service members, meaning that they should be serving the community. Instead, they all too often believe that the community serves them because they see themselves as ""the embodiment of the law.""

Let's be honest, being a police officer is hard on the mind and body. It's often your job to deal with the worst of your own society on a weekly basis. It's very difficult to confront these things and not let it change the way you think about people and the way you deal with them. You get short tempered. You start to assume the worst of the people you're dealing with. Hell, I worked at a coffee shop for 5 years and started assuming the worst in customers because I saw the stupid shit people would do day after day after day. I can only imagine how i'd feel if I had to directly deal with murders, domestic violence cases, robbery, white collar crime, etc etc.

Also, there are very few people in this world who don't let power get to their head. You give someone a badge, a gun and the assumption that the courts will be on their side for just about anything they do, well fuck. No wonder a lot of police officers are assholes. They have no incentive not to be. 

I think 10 years max is the most anyone should be allowed to be a police officer. It can be like the military or Americore. If you do your job well, it looks good on your resume and you can get another good job. Plus it might reduce the likelihood of you getting killed at some point (the longer you're on the police force, the more likely it becomes). 

I don't know. Might just be ranting. But I think this might solve some issues with the community and law enforcement in America.",6,1585619033,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs3yua/there_should_be_term_limits_on_how_long_someone/,unpopularopinion,1

Yes, they are extremely important in our economy, but a minimum wage is already set above the equilibrium (particularly Australia). This minimum wage is meant so employers are unable to exploit their workers and it MAINTAINS LIVING STANDARDS. It’s not meant for luxurious living. 

Businesses offer a pay that is set above what they’d like already due to minimum wage. Labour costs are expensive and people accept this pay and rightfully so.

fs3mwi,enolan99,Teenagers under the age of seventeen shouldn't be in relationships,"Maybe sixteen, but definitely not below that. I'm currently a sophomore in high school, and I couldn't possibly keep track of how many friends of mine claim to be in a relationship. They're incredibly common in high school, and I've never met anyone who shares this same opinion with me. So perhaps this is a popular opinion elsewhere, but certainly not at my school.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, relationships are positive and healthy things that everyone should get to enjoy. That being said, I think it's just cringey when fourteen and fifteen-year olds walk around school holding hands and post on social media about their ""relationships."" The vast majority of them aren't mature enough to handle a relationship, and none of them are old enough to give consent. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, the earliest teenagers should be in a relationship is when they're seventeen, or in their senior year of high school. This is because they're only a year away from the age of consent, and also because they're about to head to college, where relationships and dating are very common. I think it'd be good to get some experience and knowledge of what it's like to be in a relationship beforehand. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then again, who am I to tell people what they can and cannot do? It's a free country, and it's also not really any of my business. I just think that the responsible thing to do is wait until you're seventeen.",25,1585617755,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs3mwi/teenagers_under_the_age_of_seventeen_shouldnt_be/,unpopularopinion,1

fs3m3l,devacita,"This ""modern"" age is confusing","It's just too confusing.. We have all these instincts that developed throughout time and they're connected with our emotions, and now they seem useless. The more people are comfortable, the more it seems they're unhealthy, fat, depressed. It seems like in the countries where you don't have to fight for your survival that you're more fucked up in the brain and body. I'm learning to love fear cause it makes me forget about everything unimportant and sends me in a flow state of which I have to be as creative and brave and every feeling that I feel is valuable and worth living through. But it's sad cause I have to force situations to invite fear instead of fear happening naturally like throughout history, before comfortable home and TV and Internet. I feel like people before who lived in fear had better connections with other people and themselves. They stayed healthy cause they knew it would help them be stronger, which would help them survive. Now, in the modern world, we don't even feel the need to stay healthy. We do it so we can look good. It doesn't feel right to me. Every emotion and instinct and body part and function we have has a reason for it, and I feel like now, we're not practising them, but slowly shutting them down subconsciously cause we dont need them. Dopamine was a legitimate award, now we get fed up with it every single day and it destroys us. When we do need them, it's not because of survival like I feel it's intended, but for selfish purposes which push it to a level not even worth happening for in my opinion. This is something I thought about long time and I realize all kinds of movies exist cause we're all confused, but I wanna know what you think. I just feel like we were using our instincts for good, and now we use them for something else and I feel like we're going in a weird direction globally",5,1585617671,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs3m3l/this_modern_age_is_confusing/,unpopularopinion,1

fs3j2w,525600bitches,Landlords aren’t shitty people just for being landlords,"I get that a lot of landlords who live in certain cities where rent is high and places to live are scarce have the opportunity to take advantage of tenants, and some do. I’ve had terrible landlords that would never fix anything and charged me out the ass. But the fact of the matter is landlords provide a useful service to society. 

They also put up with a lot more shit than we give them credit for. Every person I’ve known to be a landlord has had ridiculously awful tenants at one point or another. They would leave trash everywhere, cause irreparable damage, not pay their rent and take advantage of the landlord. One of my friends found a giant, dead snake in a tank in the attic of their property. 

And if you blame your landlord for kicking you out if you can’t make rent then you’re crazy entitled, you don’t deserve to live in a home for nothing. They need to pay their mortgages and pay their bills too. 

There are still some bad landlords out there and it’s up to you to protect your rights as a tenant.

fs3i11,pengoobanana,Spongebob had good seasons after season 3,"Alright I am tired of people saying: “the show went bad after season 3”. Listen, season 3 is my favorite season and holds up as one of the funniest seasons in cartoon history. BUT, the show still had good seasons after that. Season 4 was still pretty good, and I would prefer it over season 1. Oh let’s get this out of the way. Season 1 wasn’t that good. It’s fine and it has amazing episodes. It has some amazing highs, but those feel like an exception instead of the norm. I don’t get why season 4 is so hated, but season 1 is regarded as one of the best. People forget great episodes such as. Skill Crane, Dunces and Dragons, Have You Seen This Snail?, Fear of a Krabby Patty, and many more. It honestly holds up as well as seasons 2 and 3. Season 5 is a pretty controversial season, some say it was good and some say it was bad. To the people that have told me they like season 5 they don’t love it like the seasons prior. I’m in the middle, it think it is over-hated, but it isn’t as good as seasons 2-4. For me this is the point where the show started to decay. Finally I will say, Spongebob is good again. Season 9 was pretty good and in my opinion, 9B holds up as well as seasons 2-4. Season 10 wasn’t as good, but still enjoyable. Season 11, god bless season 11. It was amazing. Probably not as good as 9B, but a great season nonetheless. So now the show is at season 12, and I think I prefer it to season 11. I can see why people don’t like the new style.

If you’re breaking up with someone (particularly if the breakup is coming out of nowhere), I recommend avoiding at all costs showering them with empty compliments at the time of the breakup to soften the blow.

fs3csy,Von_Chubb,I LOVED season 8 of Game of Thrones,"I think it was a masterpiece on par with some of the best episodes the series had to offer. I loved nearly everything from the costumes, to the acting, the set pieces and scenery, and even the CGI added to the battles instead of being a distraction. The 1st two episodes gave me the reunions between many characters that I wanted while also maintaining the political and military backstabbing and betrayal that I loved in previous seasons. The Long Night completely shattered all my expectations and was one of if not the best fictional battle I've ever seen in any medium.  
I also think the final 3 episodes get WAY too much hatred and the events that took place were heavily foreshadowed and fleshed out in earlier seasons. For instance, Daenerys had been bringing fire and blood with her to every place she visited since she performed blood and fire magic rituals and obtained her dragons.  
I also want to give credit to David Benioff and D.B. Weiss aka D&amp;D for adapting a nearly impossible to adapt book series that even the creator can't finish and I think they did an amazing job with the material they were given.",27,1585616690,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs3csy/i_loved_season_8_of_game_of_thrones/,unpopularopinion,1

That’s not really my point though. Putting makeup videos on top of a trending lists, whether they legitimately should be there or not based on views, is wrong.

When they stuff like that at the end of the conversation it just makes them sound like little children and ignorant.

Im trying to have a debate/conversation and they will always say

""Why you pressed?""
""Bye,sis""
""Stop I won""

Like who the fuck do you think you are? Are you that ignorant that you can't have a normal conversation without saying those words?It just makes them sound so stupid and ignorant that I don't know how people say that.

""You go girl""
""Slay""
""That guy deserved it""
""Make his pocket hurt""
""Slay queen""
Etc.

Like how ignorant are you to say stuff like that when the video itself shows that the girl is in the wrong?

Most people who have ever done even mild research know that this would ABSOLUTELY NOT be a good idea IRL. Obviously you'd go to jail, but I'm talking about the whale itself. Willy would NEVER survive in the wild. It takes A LOT of time and effort to try and integrate an animal back into the wild, especially an animal like a killer whale. Whats INCREDIBLY ironic is that the owners of the whale used in Free Willy actually tried to do this! They spent alot of time and money trying to integrate him back into open ocean with a familiar pod, and it failed drastically. 2. ""Randall did you call the police?"" ""It wouldn't do any good! If Willy doesn't get to the water he's gonna die!"" ... actually, it would have done plenty of good. Considering the time it took to get Willy out of the draining tank and to the ocean, they could have easily called the police while starting the preparations to move Willy to a new body of water. The police would have quickly called in special crews to get him into a new body of water SOMEWHERE to be cared for. Simultaneously, it would have been a big whistle blow on the a**h*** for trying to commit INSURANCE FRAUD!

Decades after World War 2 , Western Europe prospered , and most of Africa was left underdeveloped. In a perfect world, France and the UK would pay reparations to its former colonies.

The US has committed some atrocities, but they were just following Europe’s footsteps. The Europe may seem like a socialist paradise, but that’s because they’re better at splitting the spoils.

To top it all off, being a black among blacks would probably feel a bit comforting.  


I (white male) lived outside of LA in a Hispanic suburb for a while.  I had a taste of what being a minority felt like.  I wouldn't want to spend my whole life that way.  It would definitely challenge me.

fs2rjz,youknowwhattheysay12,Films and video games should stop having an unnecessary amount of flashing lights because it ruins the experience for some viewers,"I feel like i should clairfy that I am not a photosensitive epileptic, but I do have a type of epilepsy which causes me to be sensitive to some flashing as it causes ""polyspike acitvity"" which causes me to have severe headaches and migraines.  

When I went to go see star wars back a while ago there was a warning outside which stated that ""it could cause problems for photosensitive epileptics.""  I am not suggesting that they change the entire film but maybe put out an optional version digitally where they remove the severity of the flashing when the film is being released on dvd. Personally, i couldn't watch the entirety of the last scene in Star Wars and had to leave because my headache was getting so bad. Its even worse in video games, when you can't cover your eyes or leave. By the way before people say that i ignored the warning and i put myself in that position, honestly i agree with you i should have heeded the warning. However, Star Wars is one of my favourite franchises and i knew the risk, i was more than willing to get a headache to watch the film (i packed paracetamol and 4head just in case). But my main point is that i think that having so much flashing in a film to the point where it renders it unwatchable for some viewers, or could cause a tonic clonic seizure for others, is unnecessary and is a bad move on the director's part.

fs2d6k,southwoodhunter,"Just because you don't want to spend every waking minute with your child for weeks on end, doesn't mean you have a bad kid or are a crappy parent.","So many memes about how people are about to find out that their kid is actually the problem... in some cases, absolutely. But in *most* cases, absolutely not.

To all you non-parents out there, let me pose a question to you: Is there *anyone* in your life that you would be willing to spend all day with, every day for weeks on end?

If the answer is ""yes"", good. You must have some super cool people in your life. 

Now imagine that person was completely reliant on *you* the entire time. You have to feed them, clean up after them, bathe them, put them to bed, wake up if they wake up, etc. All day everyday, for weeks. No breaks, no alone time. You can't even take shit without them clawing at the door.

I would bet you would grow pretty tired of it, pretty quickly. That's what being a parent to a child is like in this current environment.

I have a 5 year old. He's the sweetest kid in the world. I love him *immensely*. But after a solid week with him, I'm sick of his company, and frankly he's probably sick of mine.

Kids are just small people. They're still people. My kid is *just* as unhappy about having to spend all day inside as I am.

He gets bored, frustrated, annoyed, anxious, exasperated, etc. Just like me. Does that make him a bad kid? No, it makes him a human being.

Am I bad parent for not relishing *every* moment, every *incessant* question, complaint, weary sigh? No. Because I'm a person too.

I don't care who you are, take your *best* friend in the world, your ride or die, and you would be at eachothers throats under these circumstances.

Same goes for your wife, partner, SO, whatever. It's *okay* to want some down time. It's only natural. Don't beat yourself up about. I bet your cat is sick of your shit too.

Edit: I'm not saying being a parent is some kind of elevated status that you ""just wouldn't understand"".
Some people dont want kids and that's cool. You do you. I'm just using parenthood as an example because it illustrates my point.",17,1585613015,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs2d6k/just_because_you_dont_want_to_spend_every_waking/,unpopularopinion,1

fs2bz0,VengefulHufflepuff,"Star Wars: The Jedi are evil, not the Sith","[SPOILERS] For example, in episode 3, the Jedi council want Anikin to spy on Chancellor Palpatine just to make sure he is on the Jedi’s side, Palpatine flips the situation to allow Anikin believe that the Jedi are trying to take over. However, there is almost zero difference between the Jedi “over throwing the Chancellor” vs double checking on the Chancellor, making sure that he is on the Jedi council’s side. Thus, control and security is the same exact thing as overthrowing the chancellor, which in turn, has the same end result of taking power from the chancellor. 

Additionally, the Jedi is assumed to be about “peace, balance, harmony, etc” whereas the Sith believe in “Passion, power, emotion, and etc”. The Jedi beliefs are contradictory to the human condition aka emotion whereas the Sith are the most human in comparison. 

So the question is, is it evil that the Jedi fights the human condition (I completely understand that there are other races besides humans in Star Wars but for the sake of the argument, let’s assume most intelligent aliens are held with the same levels and expectations as other intelligent humans, such as leaders like count Duku or Obi-Wan. I am using the term “humans” as any intelligent beings that are on the same or similar level of that makes sense)? Or is it evil for the Sith to follow through with the human condition? In essence, thus, are humans then inherently evil? 

So technically, chancellor Palpatine is right that good and evil is a point of view, just like how laws are made to keep societies in order with the end goal of keeping as many humans alive as possible, even if it means sacrificing or scapegoating a specific group.

Additionally, when Mace Windu fought senator Palpatine, he wouldn’t have been able to redirect Palpatine’s “evil” (I guess you could say) power back at him in the first place, if he was truly a good Jedi knight who stood true to all his Jedi principles. 

In sum, the Jedi are a dogmatic group (arguably politically and religiously) seizing control of the republic and are just as susceptible to corruption just as anyone, including those of the dark side. So really, it’s who is at play and what actions anyone makes that defines who is considered good or evil in the Star Wars universe. 

Thus, I understand why Anakin thinks that “The Jedi are evil”, in that good and evil are just opposite sides of the same coin.",15,1585612893,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs2bz0/star_wars_the_jedi_are_evil_not_the_sith/,unpopularopinion,1

So get this, ok? He’s mad at Deku because he thinks Deku lied to him about not having a Quirk. This is already pretty lame, but it gets worse when you consider his and Deku’s relationship. He literally tormented Deku for his entire life, and now he’s acting as if his best friend betrayed him or something. That makes no sense. Deku owes him nothing. Bakugo expecting the person he bullied to be honest with him is just so amazingly bad. He’s straight up like a domestic abuser who gaslights victims into thinking that they’ve done something wrong. 

And the best part is, Bakugo would have to be a complete idiot to even come up with his theory. Does he really think 10 year old Deku was playing 4D chess with him or something? Or that he wouldn’t use his powers in self defense one of the many times Bakugo chose to physically attack him? 

Either that, or he’s just jealous, which is also pretty lame, although he’s not as evil if this is the case.

fs200k,DRoy711,Being microchipped isn’t a terrible idea,"Ever since being microchipped came out as “a mark of the beast”, progress has been incredibly slowed for some great advances. Here are just some of dozens of reasons why I think being chipped is a great idea. 

- If someone is lost, kidnapped, or missing, a chip with location tracking would be incredibly convenient. Obviously someone shouldn’t be watching you at all times, but if someone has dementia- they could be found. The thousands of kidnappings a year could be found. People lost on hikes...could be found. So much benefits to just the “location” basis alone. Our phones already track our locations, so why is this the number one issue with this idea? 

- Banking information and money. If banks were connected to the chips, scanning your chip would be so much easier. Imagine never having to worry about a wallet being stolen again or physical money. 

- Identity someone. Proving your 21, using it as a method of ID for passports, bars, whatever you need. Using the chips to scan bodies found in whatever unfortunate event may occur...

These are just some of the MANY benefits. I don’t care what religion you are, but believing being “chipped” as a mark of a beast is silly to me. 

I definitely can see the drawbacks of this, but keeping an open mind towards technology and making life easier is something I’m always for. I also understand corruption and how this could be used for bad, but personally I think the pros outweigh the cons.

fs1oq9,Flinn_Bella,THere is nothing wrong with hitting your child when he deserves it.,"I don't have a child yet (unfortunately!), but I plan on adopting some soon. Now, I know that humans are very much like primal animals. The only way a primal animal learns is through a strong beating, so the only way a child can learn effectively is through this same method! It's a human instinct; when you get beat for doing something, don't do it again. For proof that it's a human instinct look no further than animals. If your pet did something you didn't like, you probably gave it a very firm beating, one that will not be forgotten soon. As a result, the pet didn't do that again! The same logic applies to humans! You have to give your child a firm strong beating and then it will learn! I know many people who had this applied to them (including myself), and they all turned out great! I am sick if people saying you shouldn't beat your child, they are just too soft to accept the realities of this world! Hopefully you also see the same logic, and are enlightened by this post. Cheers! :)

fs1dwx,AlphaPhoenix433,"No business should have to pay its employees a ""living wage""","Recent events have once again brought up a debate about minimim wage, whether it's enough to live off of, etc. I often see people post something along the lines of ""if you can't afford to pay a living wage, you shouldn't be in business."" To me, this makes no sense. A wage is an amount freely agreed upon by two parties to exhange one's labour for money. If both parties accept, this implies that the agreed upon wage is worth more to the worker than their time, and vice versa for the employer.

A minimum wage is just the government stepping in between two private parties and arbritrarily setting a price floor - ie telling the two they can't agree on a wage of less than a given amount. Like any price floor, this leads to inefficiencies. Imagine someone who has limited skills, and can only offer $10/hour worth of labour to an employer. If you set the minimum wage at, say, $15, what will happen? They will not be hired. Both the employer and employee is worse off. 

Now I know there will be many objection to this. The biggest one is ""So you think that someone should starve because they can't provide enough value to an employer?"" No, I don't. I think that the government should help take of them. If someone is in a position that, for whatever reason, they can't find work that will pay them enough to live, we have a collective responsibility to take care of them. The government fulfills this role, as an extension of the public interest. Whether this is through welfare programs, or UBI, or whatever, doesn't matter. But it's crazy to expect a private party to, on their own, provide for the welfare of a random person.",82,1585609441,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs1dwx/no_business_should_have_to_pay_its_employees_a/,unpopularopinion,1

fs18ip,NLLumi,Jreg’s unironic political opinions are not some kind of great mystery.,"In ‘Political Polarization’ he makes it pretty clear that extremism is basically a band-aid to help with depression, using violence to give himself purpose. Other videos like the one about ‘ending the World War trilogy’ and ‘let’s just kill each other’ further cement it. His vid about zoomers vs. boomers makes it clear that a disintegration of previous social structures like community and religion have exacerbated it, and other videos expand on it further (like the one about ‘Postpostmodernism’).

Meanwhile, he’s made a bunch of vids openly mocking right-wing ideas, like the feasibility and benefit of ethnostates and the conspiracy theories revolving Jews (or ‘Hughs’), and discussing left-leaning ideas like climate change and fast fashion as well as the ills of neoliberalism. His main gripe with the left, as is the case with plenty of left-leaning satirists (e.g. Lior Schleien &amp; Trevor Noah), is that it’s ineffectual, distracted by trivialities, not leftist _enough_, or any combination of those. The two most positively portrayed characters in his Centricide are Socialist, who speaks sincerely and coherently about ways to fight back against capitalism in slower, measured ways, and Progressive, who seems to be just… _past_ those petty squabbles. Hell, the character most positively portrayed among the Radicals is AnCom, who is shown to be overzealous and misguided but still having his (quis?) heart in the right place, while AuthRight has none except maybe his charisma.

fs16s1,HazyLandscape,Falling in love is just a misinterpretation,"Yo, so like, I think that the feeling of ""falling is love"" is just a misinterpreted moment in time. It's a mix-up the brain does because it has been wrongly trained in how to react to this by culture.

Think about that last time you fell in love. Think about it. How did it feel? Did it feel like this was the perfect moment, the perfect match-up, the ideal way of how things could've been arranged in that one single instant? The sky, the air, the touch, the smell, the view? What if that's just like another form of energy? Like ""time energy""? Because it's not always true that you fall in love with your soulmate. It doesn't always last forever and it's not always the true one love, is it? But you know what it is every time? A person on your timeline that crosses your path and that will substantially impact you in your future.

So what if it's just a misinterpretation in the first place? What if it's something that you also felt when you first met your mother, your grandmother or your sibling? You can't remember those moments most of the time, and there probably is no real rule to who you get that feeling with. Maybe that's why some people never fall in love, because their timelines actually never get impacted from a lot of people for a longer period of time in general. It's probably very individual and can vary a lot from person to person. But that would also mean that if we wouldn't have reacted in this misinterpreted way, the person might not have impacted us as much in the future. But that doesn't work since the time energy must've been created in the future for you to feel it. So maybe to stop the misinterpretation could also just be a path to a happier life.",9,1585608730,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs16s1/falling_in_love_is_just_a_misinterpretation/,unpopularopinion,1

fs13r3,bubbles-505,Shoving someone's face in their cake on their birthday is just humiliating and rude.,"I was just watching this video of a little girl, maybe 6, all decked out in her princess dress, tiara, and bright birthday girl smile, having her face shoved into her cake by an adult... of course she became inconsolable and her pretty cake and dress were ruined...

It occurred to me, not for the first time, that I hate this practice that's been made popular by viral videos. I like rude humor and pranks and have been known to laugh when people get hurt, I'm not gonna lie, but unlike everyone else who thinks this is hilarious, I just feel like it's so rude to ruin someone's special day AND THE DANG CAKE.

fs0zmz,Doublecrossedtwice,Teachers are appropriately compensated.,"Every time I hear that “teachers have the hardest job in the world” or “teachers are woefully underpaid” I roll my eyes a little. Of course there are extreme examples at both end of the spectrum but the average teachers salary in the US is $60k (almost exactly the median income for college graduates) despite the fact that many teachers have under 200 working days a year (a typical full time employee works 260) plus at least 2 weeks of PTO. If teachers picked up a second job during the 60-80 days they aren’t working while other full time workers are (tutoring, camp counselor, bartender are all seasonal jobs with flexible schedules) they would be making a much higher than average salary. Add to this the fact that many public employees still get a pension and their union pretty much guarantees job security, I’d say it’s a pretty good deal. 


I don’t doubt that teaching is hard work but is it really that much harder than the dozens of blue collar professions that pay less? Do you not think that there are plenty of white collar jobs that pay the same or a little more than teachers make that are just as hard? Every job comes with it’s unique set of challenges and stresses, but if you get months of vacation and make a good living doing it, I don’t think you should be lauded as a selfless martyr.",15,1585608011,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs0zmz/teachers_are_appropriately_compensated/,unpopularopinion,1

fs0wrl,PostCalzoneOwO,Solar panels are bad. Here is why...,"You might think that solar panels are ""Free Energy"" and therefore should be utilized as much as possible. This however may not be the case. 

The most significant reason to not use solar panels is because of their high cost of maintenance (especially in the winter) and tendency to pollute upon disposal. Solar panels, when not disposed of properly, can release large amounts of toxic waste into the environment ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2018/05/23/if-solar-panels-are-so-clean-why-do-they-produce-so-much-toxic-waste/)). If someone doesnt consider the cost of disposal and the cost to society as a result of poor disposal of these solar panels, there can be a large influx of pollution in the coming years as solar panels get abandoned. 

In my opinion, solar panels should be mainly sold to corporations and the disposal costs should be charged up front so as to account for the negative social impacts of solar panel disposal. The government shouldnt really subsidize solar panels without also charging this up front cost of disposal. They should also be used on top of buildings in areas that have already been inhabited by humans. This would limit the societal consequences of solar panels from their immediate obstruction to wildlife and their long term pollution tendencies.",9,1585607745,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs0wrl/solar_panels_are_bad_here_is_why/,unpopularopinion,1

fs0hhg,Lyckstolp,"Nihilism gets more shit ""than it deserves""","Now I'm not officially educated in moral philosophy,  but neither am I a stranger to it.

Over the years I've seen quite a bunch of people nagging on Nihilism and its ""detrimental effects on mental health"". Relatively famous ""mental health philosophers"" like Jordan Peterson comes to mind, and while I do agree with some of his philosophy to life, he (like many) vilify nihilism and make it seem as something purely negative.

I entered a state of nihilism during and after some serious identity crises. I felt directionless: life is meaningless and my impact on a larger scale is fairly negligible. I didn't see where I would be going as I was refuting morality and purpose.

Eventually something changed. I still think life's meaningless, but instead of crying over something that seemed like a tragedy at first I began relishing in the freedom of meaninglessness. Instead of being depressed over absence of purpose I developed an attitude of laughing in the face of danger: in a purposeless world where we have no obligations we're free to do and become whatever we want. How liberating that nothing's ""inscribed in stone""!

These revelations changed me for good. I regained confidence in myself, and acquired a form of acceptance that I hadn't had before. I've become unbreakable, optimistic and more grateful for the experiences I live through. I've had people be surprised over my ""transformation"" , and a good chunk of them always shake their heads when I tell them my story. 

The negative stigma that revolves around nihilism is part to blame for this, as is the counterintuitivity of turning something seemingly negative into seemingly positive. People that have had similar experiences with nihilism as I have have all turned out ""stronger"" thanks to entering a state of nihilism, and I think these perspectives aren't getting enough attention. Most people tend to think of passive nihilism and the pessimism it can bring, which really isn't everything there is about the philosophy. 

This post is long already, but I believe it's important to not dismiss topics like this just because they seem ""bad"". There's always something to be learnt, and hopefully a plethora of perspectives can contribute to more suitable ideas for living one's own life. 


tl;dr : Too many people give nihilism negative criticism when it in actually can tremendously help people through tough times and transform them into ""stronger"" people. There is freedom to be seen in realizing meaninglessness.",12,1585606336,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs0hhg/nihilism_gets_more_shit_than_it_deserves/,unpopularopinion,1

fs0bin,Noelle-Spades,Academy Awards shouldn't be credible,"I've argued with my family and multiple friends about the Oscars, Grammy's, and whatever else could give a prestigious award, and most recently I've found myself caring less and less about them.

I don't care for the politics behind how a movie or artist win anything, I've only heard rumours of corruption, bribery, and basically everything you could possibly accuse these Academies of. I just genuinely don't think people should have their opinions swayed by them anymore.

Granted, it's nice to see movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse or Parasite get internationally recognized for their fantastic works, as well as to highlight the talents of actors, directors, musicians or whomever else.

But in spite of that, a fancy award shouldn't be the selling point of *anything*. It should speak for itself, and people should come to their own conclusions over whether it's good or not.

For instance, Black Panther, (and understand I'm saying this as a POC) did *not* deserve an Oscar nomination, let alone for Best Picture. Not because it's a super hero film, or because 'I HaTe My OwN rAcE' or want to be 'unique and quirky' as I've been accused, but because while it's personally not in anyway a bad film, it's not the *best* movie that year offered. There were dozens of better films that were disregarded since they didn't have 'the same production'. (If any super hero film, Spider-Verse should've definetely taken it's place personally).

These awards have been around for decades and honestly I worried that people don't care to make good productions anymore, some just seem to be in it for the titles and prestiege. If any of these productions should be respected they should *earn* it.

If you disagree, please explain why, cause I genuinely can't see many benefits to come from them anymore.",0,1585605812,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fs0bin/academy_awards_shouldnt_be_credible/,unpopularopinion,1
fs0bb0,SauceTheeBoss,The 45 year old hospital ships (Mercy and Comfort) should be replaced,"The hospital ships (Mercy-class) are outdated, slow, small, and clumsy.  I understand that compared to nothing at all, these are great...  But we can do better.

Both were original built in 1974/1976 as OIL tankers. Repurposed in 1986 as hospital ships by the US Navy.  ""Patient movement within the ship is limited. Built as oil tankers, the original oil storage bulkheads were retained, but have no doors, which means that patients must be brought up to the top deck in order to be moved from a lower compartment in one part of the ship to another.""

These ships are slow to arrive. The current top speed is 17.5 knots VS A modern aircraft carrier can do an excess of 30 knots. The Mercy-class ship uses the same dirty propulsion as a cruise-liner, while a modern aircraft carrier uses nuclear reactors. Not suggesting that a nuclear powered hospital ship is the way to go, I'll defer to others on what should be done.

While the Mercy class has 1000 beds, 500 are for limited (self) care only. The rest breakdown into: 120 light care beds, 280 intermediate care beds, 80 intensive care unit beds, and 20 post-anesthesia care unit beds. I have limited access to statistics, but this looks to be similar to a mid-sized hospital (feel free to correct me on this).  The Mercy Class ship is 894 ft long, 106 ft wide, 100 ft tall.  But compared to a modern aircraft carrier (@ 1106 ft long, 200-ish ft wide, 250 ft tall), the Mercy Class ship is not that big.  However, one could argue that the current ships are already TOO big and make it hard to maneuver and dock... so a fleet of smaller, more nimble ships might be better.  

And they are clumsy with only ONE helicopter landing pad. If a helicopter becomes stuck on the pad (malfunction or fuel), that pad is now unusable. And because the ship wasn't designed for helicopters, rough waters can also make the pad unusable.

The previous generation ships (Haven class) also lasted 45-ish years (6 were built in 1943-1944, in service until 1989). So it's time to consider updating.  EVEN IF we started NOW, it still will take multiple years (5-10?) to design, manufacturer, and crew a ship. 

If we're making another coronavirus spending bill, can we earmark $50-75 billion for the creation of two or three MODERN hospital ships?  Ones that are designed from the ""ground up"" (or ""sea up"") to be  hospital ships. Made for the needs of today, using experiences and lessons learned from the current ships to design new ships.  


 **""They're wonderful ships, but they're dinosaurs. ... They were designed in the '70s, built in the '80s, and frankly, they're obsolete,""**  \- Vice Admiral Michael L. Cowan, the Surgeon General and chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, ***2004*****.**

I've had problems with my parents shoving my own faith down my throat, and I've talked to them about it. However, they've started to do it again, especially my mom. It annoys the hell out of me.

I don't care if you raise your kids a certain way with a certain belief. But there's going to come a time in their lives where they may not want to follow it anymore. And that's okay. Because we're allowed to believe what we want. Getting upset and trying to force them to believe it again won't help, and it'll just drive them away.

That said, there's nothing wrong with continuing to show them the love they deserve, and praying for them. If they decide to come back, that's great! If not, then that's their choice. Wrong or right. God loves them regardless.

fs05dx,LDLV1986,Physical health is more important than mental health,"I don't mean to trivialize anyone's emotional problems when I say this but I think that the western world prioritizes mental health way more than physical health when it should be the other way around. Everyone and their mother keeps talking about an apparent mental health crisis while almost nobody seems to care about the far more obvious physical health crisis going on in the western world.

Think about it: if someone is physically unhealthy, will that not lead to poor mental health as well? If someone has a disease or a broken bone or some other deformity or ailment, shouldn't they prioritize fixing their physical problem rather than the emotional reaction that they have to it? Wouldn't fixing their physical problem also fix the associated mental problem?

This very strange way of thinking has gotten so bad that it has even shown up during this coronavirus situation; despite the fact that there is a virus lurking around the world that causes *extreme physical health issues* in the people it infects, people seem to be more worried about their mental health. Everyone seems to think that being anxious due to a deadly virus is a sign of a mental illness rather than a perfectly understandable reaction.

Its so obvious that I’m not okay, but you can’t do anything. I get that you’re displaying concern and that’s appreciated but why do we always ask the most obvious question? Just let the person process the pain for a second before you pressure them to respond. If some idiot did a back flip and landed on their head, that does require immediate verbal action, because that’s some serious shit (and don’t move them), but yeah.

You’re job is not worth more because it is labeled “essential” it is worth less because it less quantifiable by its required skill set than other, higher-paying jobs.

I feel for those people who are less-appreciated, especially in a regular day-to-day outside of the pandemic. Should they be paid more? Maybe. But I think it’s shortsighted to say “OH, WHAT IF THEY WEREN’T AROUND NOW? WOULDN’T BE EASY HUH?” Well - yes, of course; but that’s unrealistic and would never happen. For every low-skilled worker who wants to quit because they’re not being paid enough, there are several others waiting to take their spot, excited for the opportunity.

frzvx8,generationseX,"The video game review process is increasingly becoming outdated, and as time as passes, subjective opinions given by notable media outlets/influencers are framed as objective facts by both themselves and their audiences.","Now, let’s just say, there are some obvious benefits to video games reviews, as consumers can be notified of a game releasing in an unfinished state, not playing as advertised, or being littered with predatory micro-transaction mechanics. It can help many avoid spending their money on a broken product, a misrepresented product, or a product that will urge them to spend even more of their money. 

That being said, the review-cycle is flatfuck broken, as some major outlets are either dishonest about the games themselves, or failed to complete them in their entirety, like IGN. Despite them having a massive platform within the realm of gaming, they’ve routinely been a source of criticism for gaming journalism. This is not the case for every single game they review, but given their amount of resources, it’s a shame they approach things so amateurishly. 

Not as worse as that, but particularly frustrating are smaller (but still have respectable followings), video-game essay type influencers, who often find themselves blazing through multiple video games a month, some with 60+ hour campaigns, and expected to use their platforms to give a proper opinion on the games at hand. Sometimes, it leads to “I was wrong about XYZ videos”, or somewhat hurried reviews, where they seem to be meeting embargo deadlines instead of sitting with the games and fully understanding them. I can respect them for taking the time and effort to make the content in the first place, but many of them completely fail to understand the power of their influence, and also fail to understand how much of their personal bias affects their own experiences with the games. 

These problems are exacerbated through the Reddit/Youtube/Twitter cycle, where hot takes and narratives from all of these entities can lead to a dumpster fire of discourse, where the popular opinion can (unfortunately) become representative of the entire community even if it is not the most reasonable one. It’s nice to share a community with other players, but at times, certain opinions travel via word of mouth and snowball into fuckery. (Spider-Man 2018 PuddleGate is a straight up embarrassment) 

At this moment in time, majority of the research someone wants to have on a game is readily available at their own finger tips. The days of needing a Game Informer in the mail or waiting on G4TV is legitimately and almost entirely dead, yet the community still seems to want confirmation from specific sources, instead of looking things up themselves, seeking possible demos, and taking in a multitude of opinions from multiple sources. 

While I do believe video games reviewers are important, there needs to be a serious reconsideration of how games are reviews, and there needs to be a MUCH smaller emphasis on who can get their opinion out first. Especially since many of these reviewers REFUSE to do secondary reviews a year down the line, as some games are patched after launch, given free content, or small quality of life improvements that the community asked for. And many reviewers need to come to terms with the reality of something being a bad game, and something being a video game they genuinely aren’t into, because me not liking the Persona series doesn’t imply that Persona games are bad. I just don’t like em. 

No one wants to waste $60, but not all developers deserve to have their titles be at the mercy of a handful of YouTubers and vocal Internet minorities.

Consequently, the search results are useless.

Google is still the most advanced search engine, but the reason they rose to prominence was because of their ability to give incredibly ACCURATE search results.

frzubp,Gnome_Sane,United States Leading THE WORLD with infections! Except they aren't.,"When comparing a country with a population of 320 million to a country with a European population of 10 million or even 60 Million - the comparison is unfair on a number of levels.

If you compared the US to the entire EU, that would be a more equal comparison.

If you compared the percentage of infected population in the US to the percentage of infected population in a small country like Spain - that would be a fair comparison.

Comparing the actual numbers is literally stupid, yet that's our global western media!

These figures are from a few days ago, but they still illustrate the point:
_______________________________________________________________________________
Population of France - 67 million - 29,155 cases - 1,696 deaths

Population of Germany - 82 million - 49,344 cases - 304 deaths

Population of Italy - 60 million - 86,498 cases - 9,134 deaths

population of Spain - 47 million - 64,059 cases - 4,934 Deaths

Still add in another 100 million pop to get to US levels... so that's

netherlands, - 17..8 million - 8,603 cases - 546 dead

belgium, - 11.4 million 7,284 cases - 289 dead

switzerland - 8.5 million - 12,928 cases - 231 dead

and the UK... population 66 million - 14,543 cases - 759 dead

And **now you can compare all of that** to the USA and be about equal and honest in your comparison between populations and squarefootage.

Population of USA 330 million - 94,425 cases - 1,429 deaths

________________________________________________________________________________

Now let's look at the percentages of the population infected:

France - 67 million - 29,155 cases - 0.043%

Germany - 82 million - 49,344 cases - 0.060%

Italy - 60 million - 86,498 cases - 0.144%

Spain - 47 million - 64,059 cases - 0.136%

netherlands, - 17..8 million - 8,603 cases - 0.048%

belgium, - 11.4 million 7,284 cases - 0.063%

switzerland - 8.5 million - 12,928 cases - 0.152%

and the UK... population 66 million - 14,543 cases - 0.022%

USA - 330 million - 94,425 cases - 0.028%

_______________________________________________________________________________

I went to Columbia here for my exchange, and studied at a private college in Germany. One thing which I found annoying amoung many redditors (Europeans and Americans alike) is the believe that College/University in many European countries is for free. While this is true, there are fundamental differences in the system that explain the lack of cost. 

College/university is many European countries is not something normal. The majority of people don't go to college, instead we have excellent Apprenticeship programmes. You can become a nurse in Germany without ever stepping into a college. The majority of roles in Europe don't require a university degree. 

The majority of degrees in Germany / European countries are used for quite academic jobs (research/high finance/lawyers/doctors and so on)

Also universities in Germany have extremely high drop out rates, a drop out rate of 50% is normal. The facilities in Germany were also significantly worse than Columbia. It's all super basic in our universities.

frzh6h,BabySuperfreak,Bar soap is better than liquid soap,"I switched back to the bar after over a decade of using liquid soap. My skin is softer, cleaner, stays hydrated longer, I no longer get acne, and my KP has all but completely cleared up. This is from someone who suffers from chronically dry, very sensitive skin.

I also spend way less money - the most expensive bar soap at Walgreens is roughly the same price as the cheapest bottle of Suave, and will last twice as long. And that's just getting ""the most expensive"", not necessarily ""the best"".

I've heard people claim that bar soap is gross because things stick to it. However, this is problem easily solved by not dropping the damn thing. And you are aware that you can just...rinse it off, correct? 30 seconds under warm water will strip away the contaminated surface.

The only concession I'll make is that I also dislike the tacky feeling after you rinse.

frzfpx,2rightboots,"Women who commit serious crimes don’t get nearly enough shit as they deserve, compared to men.","Women who commit serious crimes (murder, rape, molestation, or serious felony’s and domestic abuse), I see so many story’s where people only show sympathy with phrases like, “what happened to her in the past” or “men can’t be raped” or the worst I’ve ever seen, “women get so much shit if they want to rape a man every so often, they should be able to”.
If men and women are equal, then you should treat them the same, when they are standing trial for violent and sex crimes. In some states the sentences are much less severe as well. That pisses me off for a number of reasons, the main one being that if you complain about being seen as weak, then lobby for lesser sentences for your gender based simply on gender.

frzf8p,Invictus102B,Male retaliatory violence and adultery,"Imagine a scenario-a man comes home from work to find his wife in bed with another man. He leaves enraged and returns later with a weapon-kills his wife and her lover and or possibly himself. 

My unpopular opinion is that in such cases of crimes of passion or jealousy-the court system should be lenient. Why you ask? 

Because men react differently to being cheated on than women. A man who is cheated on loses his self respect-its more than just a ""man card"", or some surface level marker of masculine social credit-his deepest essence is rendered shameful and worthless by cuckoldry, and his self respect is destroyed. 

In some parts of the world-this reality is still understood and so court systems and society are more lenient and sympathetic to men who commit murder in these circumstances. 

It is my opinion that here in the postindustrial west, we should adopt similar policies and attitudes of leniency for cuckolded husbands turned killers. 

This is not to ignore the loss of life, or circumstances of abuse or mental illness, but I firmly sympathize with men who have taken such actions, because the scenario I describe is not about the woman-its about the man regaining his own self worth.

I (41F) was having a conversation about books and book burnings yesterday with my husband (46M). Books on witchcraft came up and I got a thought. 
Some of these books are like super old and I wondered how these survived. I would think that during the witch trials their books would have been burned also. I do know that the majority of people who were tortured or burned were not witches. 
I started thinking that some of the accusers were witches themselves. They would falsely accuse say for instance a Christian of witchcraft. I would think that those practicing witchcraft would know the kinds of herbs that would cause someone to have hallucinations, so when this person hallucinating would be dragged into court the witch would have concrete proof that the Christian or some enemy would die or be tortured.

frz7ae,TheSafetyWipe,Liking/praising/following celebrities is a sign you have been brainwashed,"In my opinion if you look upto celebrities (actors, sports stars, reality stars etc) you have been brainwashed.

Now before i get ripped to bits from all the fans out there, let me explain.

Wishing Tom Cruise/Margot Robbie/Messi happy birthday on social media is one of the strangest things ive seen?? You think they will reply? You think they will go ""ahhh Mike for London said Happy birthday, what a man!"" Youve been brainwashed into thinking they care/know about you.

You dont know these people? They dont know or care in anyway for you, of course they'll say ""my fans are wonderful"" etc etc, but do you really believe its to you? You not know this is there brand? They have a manger telling them what to do and what to say to lure peolle in. The follows, the press time, the products they push......its all for money. Youve been brainwashed into thinking its directed to you.

Talking to your friends about some celebrity scandle?? Why? 

A celebrity donates some money to charity, why are you congratulating them? Its not hard to donate money, have you praised every other person who also donated money? Or just the rich and famous ones because you are desperate for any form of attention? You've been brainwashed into thinking there actions are better than ""normal"" people. 

Have you gone to a local charity shop and thanked the workers? No, have you offered your time to help the needy? No. But Emma watson gives a few pennies and fuck me shes the best? Shes only the best because you have been brainwashed into thinking they are better than you or anyone else.

Now please dont get me wrong, i love football, i love movies, i love music, but im not obsessed with any celebrities, i dont follow any of them watching their every move, i dont write to them. I understand they are a product.

Yes some celebrities have done amazing things, correct. But thats only a small percentage. And even then i would say thank you and move on, i would also thank the paramedics, the firefighters, the doctors and nurses, the farmers, the social works, the teachers etc etc.

I understand people will write back with about how certain celebrities have inspired them to do great things. People they followed growing up and wanted to be and it helped push them. Wonderful and im happy that happened but that doesnt mean they are some amazing person who.is above everyone. There are human. 

It just amazes me that people are crying for someone they have never met, never will, never know and ultimately are no more important than most other people on the planet but because of some great marketing/management they are godly? 

You need to grow up and get a reality check! 

They wont be there when you need help, when your skint, when you need a job, when a family member passes. Your friends and family will be there, real people in the real world so show them some respect.

We give more attention and love to somebody who doesnt even know our name than we do to people we know and see everyday.

Just to clarify when i say celebrities i mean people such as actors, musicians, sports stars. I dont mean famous people such as Martin Luther King/Marie Curie who actually contributed to this world.

I am genuinely interested in discussing this topic with people if you are serious. I would like to know if my opinion is wildly out there? Am i being to harsh?

Lines 3 hours before the stores even open, and the one costco in 40 miles is a straight up battleground where social distancing doesn't exist at all. 

If I was an asshole back when I stocked up and grabbed an extra month of supplies, I'd be livin it up without a care now. Instead I'm actually running out of TP  here since I started giving it out (and I have ibs), and down to only a week worth of noodles which haven't been in stock once since this started getting going. 

As people in the supply chains end up sick, I can only imagine this will get harder. And now that so many people in my position that didn't *truly* panic buy are running out of stock, if any future disaster happens they will be trained to do it even more.

If the message is the essential people should be paid more, or that they should get more attention then I'm still confused. The job of a celebrity is to be famous and have attention. As for the pay part, I agree that it is unjust that someone who is spending alot of their time to serve the community is grossly underpaid compared to someone who talks to screens and posts on social media, but is that new?

fryy8i,alittleoflyttle,The world is still not learning.,"We came from an extremely busy lifestyle, competing with each other of who can handle more on their plate: who can manage taking their kids to practice while also being an entrepreneur, keeping their house perfectly clean, maintaining a perfect body, making a perfect meal, all while keeping a smile on our faces and “pushing through the hard times”.  Everyone has realized their purpose and life was shown as “perfect”.

And then the world stopped. 

It forced us to slow down, to take a breath, to put down our phones, stop checking our emails at dinner, and stop the constant “what’s next” on our to do list.  Just stop.  We can take a walk, hang out with our families, and find some realness in our little life while the world is trying to reset. 

But instead of finding realness, we go back to competing, who is doing “the best” in quarantine.  Who is working out to get a better body, who is making sourdough bread from scratch, who is making the best crafts for your kids, who has beaten everyone else and has figured this out with their family and has found a new routine.  

STOP. 

This world’s chaos happened because we couldn’t stop.  Take a breath, check out your feelings, cry a bit, call your grandma, bake a recipe with your kids, just for the love of god don’t do it just to tell others that you are doing it. 

You can meditate, you can do virtual therapy, you can work out, but do it for YOU.  Be vulnerable, be not okay, it’s all okay and no one is judging, because we are all in this together.  For everyone trying to “be better coming out of this quarantine than how you came in”, choose to be real, choose the priorities that benefit your family, or your mental health, don’t choose to be it to impress people when you’re out.  ",2,1585601339,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fryy8i/the_world_is_still_not_learning/,unpopularopinion,1

frywvi,MistarSupar,People who choose to go to a community college rather than a university out of high school won’t be as successful in life as university students,"At my school, there are a lot of smart people wasting their intelligence by attending a community college in the fall. These are people with 4.0 GPAs 1550+ SATS and multiple extracurricular. They’ve also received scholarships to pay for their university, yet still want to go to community college. I always ask them why and they say it’s “financially smarter”. I think that we should value life experiences over some thing being “financially smarter”.  Community College is full of idiots and they accept everyone. I think they should feel embarrassed that they are attending the same college as slack offs in our class (the people who have 2.0 GPAS and smoke weed, drink, and party every week). Anyone whose proud of going to a community college on the inside is really just crying on the inside that they weren’t good enough to go to a university. Yeah you can transfer after two years but then you’ll be alone and have absolutely no friends which can lead to depression. And even then, all your credits might not transfer. Additionally, you’re not learning the same thing at a community college then you would be at a university for a cheaper price. Universities have better professors which leads to a better education. Also, by attending a university you’re exposed to connections and internships. A person who attends Harvard and a kid who attended a community college are not getting the same job out of school. All in all, every time I here that someone is going to a community college I automatically assume they’re dumb and didn’t take high school seriously. I just chuckle when someone tells me they’re going to a community college. Like did you even spend time applying for aid or scholarships my guy? You went through 4 years of high school just to attend a community college? That just shows how dedicated you are to succeed in life.

fryuvu,AlxRezzz,Condoms are for whores and trashy/dirty people. (Men and woman),"The main reason for its use is to prevent pregnancy and STIs or HIV. Here’s the thing though, plenty of girls who want the use of condoms are already on birth control (this isn’t only about women). Here’s what it looks like: 1. They want double the protection of pregnancy (doubt it) 2. They don’t want to get an STI or HIV. 3. Men don’t know if you’re actually on birth control. 4. You sleep around with questionable people and other people know this. 5. You actually aren’t taking birth control and want protection

Why would a person be worried about getting a disease or infection if they know the person they are intimate with. If you’re having sex with someone who is on birth control for a while and you’re still using condoms, it’s because they don’t trust you or they have been sleeping around with questionable people. Nobody likes condoms, they feel terrible during any sexual act. So the fact that people decide to use condoms is because something is worrying them. 

There’s nothing wrong with sleeping around and having fun while being protected. This being said, doing exactly that makes society look at you as a whore or trashy person (no matter what gender). I stand by this opinion. if you have a stable sex life with healthy people and people you have been close with for a while, then there is no need for condoms. (Unless birth control is out of the question).",20,1585601020,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fryuvu/condoms_are_for_whores_and_trashydirty_people_men/,unpopularopinion,1

Add to this that males are often treated as they're worthless, e.g. [this teen](https://reason.com/2018/10/17/seneca-valley-mean-girls-false-sexual/) who was falsely accused and dragged out of school in shackles without an investigation, was put under electronic surveillance, but got no apology when the girls who falsely accused him confessed they had been lying. 

You have generations of young people that feel suppressed and that don't see any recourse for fairness or being heard and turn to sick behaviours and crime.

You reap what you sow, and until that teen is in his or her late teens, every action is a consequence of upbringing and society. If a teen is sent to jail, send the parents along, and fine the schools and social  authorities from that area.

fry9hh,ParticlePhys03,Climate Change is Complicated,"&amp;#x200B;

To preface this, I am firmly in support of climate change mitigation and solutions and is probably the only issue I really care about that is ever addressed by any politician in the US.

Many claim that climate change is a hoax or is greatly exaggerated or something like this. This perception is false, carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that has a remarkably large impact on the world's climate. While some may point out that water vapor is a greenhouse gas with a greater effect, this point is disingenuous. Water vapor isn't emitted into the atmosphere to stay there for decades, centuries, or even millennia like carbon dioxide is, it literally falls out of the sky!

That previous part is what I consider to be the popular part on Reddit, but this sub isn't either T\_D or OurPresident, so I decided to put in the previous paragraph. Climate change isn't as one dimensional as many people who support the ""climate crisis"" perception claim. I see a lot of people, claim that climate change is an existential threat. A quick search of the term gives you this (paraphrased) definition: a threat or challenge that could lead to the end of human civilization or the human species. Climate change isn't going to kill off humanity, the Lake Toba super volcano couldn't do that with its climate variation effects when humanity was still in the Stone Age. So, we can discount that notion, now for whether or not it would end human civilization. In short, it is possible through indirect means, like inciting a nuclear war, but directly, it is unlikely.

First, human technology has advanced considerably, we have much better infrastructure against the damage caused by natural disasters. We can live in areas far enough from oceans and still transport things economically, and we can build our cities away from our ports as a result. This would entail massive changes, but hardly things we couldn't handle unless it was handled extremely negligently by all levels of government for decades.

My other problems are with how one-dimensional people are with climate change solutions. Right now, only about half of the carbon dioxide we put in the atmosphere is contributing to warming because of how much aerosol we put into the atmosphere with it.

If we stopped all carbon emitting processes right now, it would be the equivalent of going to see at 500ppm of CO2 on our current track as all those aerosol emitting substances would stop right alongside the carbon emitting ones. A certain candidate’s campaign calls nuclear power, geoengineering, carbon capture and sequestration, and trash incineration a ""false solution"" to climate change (not sure what the trash thing is about, but ok). I may like nuclear power, but my problems here are on the ""carbon capture and sequestration"" and ""geoengineering"". As mentioned, half of the potential warming isn't happening due to aerosols, if the aerosols come down, the warming goes up. The two ways to mitigate this are to either remove the excess carbon from the atmosphere or to put our own aerosols or respective equivalents (like a Fresnel lens, or giant mirrors in the ocean to mimic ice caps). Ignoring this, there is a very good chance we are already too far gone, either now or too soon to stop, for simply stopping emissions to be good enough. Even then, if we want to stop warming now, in the future, we may find something else that warms or cools the planet more than we like. If we have a geoengineering project, carbon emission/capture station, or megastructure up, we already control the climate and would already have the resources to stop it before it becomes a problem.

A short note on possible suggestions on the carbon capture or geoengineering front.

1. A Fresnel lens, except Earth size to refract away a portion of the sun's light set somewhere between the Earth and the Sun, like the L1 Lagrange point.

2. A system of using large solar, wind, or nuclear plants during when running at low demand/high supply to sequester carbon from the atmosphere into materials like limestone or a synthetic fuel.

3. A system of mirrors either in space or the ocean to reflect away light, behaving like artificial icecaps. While more expensive, the upside to space mirrors is that they could reflect only unused infrared light while letting in visible light. Glass is a good thermal-spectrum infrared mirror.

4. Planting a whole lot of trees, this may not sound like a big thing, but the effect to the albedo of formerly barren landscapes would be rather large, and it would sequester carbon.

5. Making everyone have a white roof (mirror roofs would be a disaster to any aircraft) to reflect sunlight whose only purpose is to warm the planet. Why the heck are shingles black anyway?

A bit of a TL; DR, first 10% climate change is real, next 20% it isn't going to kill us all or end civilization, remaining/final 70% there is more to it than stopping CO2 emissions. See list above for details on the 70%.

For anyone who likes to play online there are a lot of apps available. Kik is the worst! Kik doesn’t have a webcam live option anymore.

Anyone can pretend to be whoever they want on that app and use other peoples pictures with no way of catching them. Snapchat is a lot harder to fake. If you screenshot on snapchat the other person will know. Not to mention that you can’t send old snaps, they are live inherently. Also snapchat allows webcamming live if that’s what you want. It’s really not a competition, kik loses. Yes kik allows anonymity but at what cost l? some 500lb dude could pretend to be a woman and laughing at all the pics your sending him. If u actually want to know ur chatting with the person in the pics, snapchat is way better.

Nowadays gaming has become something equivalent to politics, the wrong word can get you attacked, like if I were to say a game like The Witcher 3 is average at best, people would be wierded out.

Another thing is that companies like Nintendo are praised for doing things EA usually does, like with their latest Pokemon game, they released 2 identical versions at 60$ price and in my opinion, it's on the same league as releasing an incomplete game for 60$.

Then there is the crazy overhyping some games have. I have 4 friends from my tiny Steam friends list who preordered Cyberpunk 2077 knowing its nearly a year prior to release (immediately after its announcement on E3 2019) and now they're annoyed due to the delay. You can also clearly see games such as Mount and Blade II Bannerlord hugely defended when people report of consistant crashing, but when Anthem released incomplete and buggy, it was blasted with negative reviews. 

THIS proves people never learned from No Man's Sky.

as a guy with a lot of unpopular gaming opinions and someone who always tries to objectively look at games, I'm scared to even talk about games with others because everything is matter of controversy and can get you pushed aside.

frxfqz,leaderrogue,People putting a considerable amount of money in free to play games are idiots.,"I know this may sound strange in the first place but here are the reasons why I believe it is stupid: ( considerable amounts being  $500 OR more spent in-game) 

1- if you are not a content creator or recover  all the money you invest in some way, you are giving money for something free in the first place. 

2-If you invest money into a free game because it has a ""pay to win"" mechanic you are just wasting money to feel stronger in-game and probably have an inferiority complex.

3-I can understand you're passionate about the game you play but is it worth paying to a company 500 or more dollars that you could invest in your future(the company didn't even ask and some charities or associations would do with this money) .

4- unless you have considerable amounts of money and you don't know what to do with it, there is always a better solution then spending it on a catgirl skin for you online racing game... 

I am a gamer and I play multiple free to pay games (League of Legends, War Thunder, Heroes and Generals...) but I do not get why would someone invest even a penny to get extra stuff even if they are passionate about it. In most games you even have the possibility to unlock everything for free with patience and effort. I know people can do whatever they want with their money but in that case they are simply paying the price of their impatience.",13,1585596592,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frxfqz/people_putting_a_considerable_amount_of_money_in/,unpopularopinion,1

frx5z5,probirs,Fullscreen is better than widescreen,"I have noticed that adapting films to fullscreen had unintended consequences that were quite good.  You tend to lose the composition of the shot as the director intended, but you always get your focus zeroed on the most important elements of the scene, which is usually the characters.  What results is a more intimate experience where you are more tightly connected to the characters' experience, because they are always front and center. 

The experience is similar to switching between diffferent angles in a 3rd person video game.  When it's zoomed out you get a more broad view of the game's scenery, but when you tighten it up you feel more like you're present with the character.

Fullscreen tends to reveal how much of the widescreen space does nothing but steals your focus from the characters.  Fullscreen focuses the experience on what matters.",13,1585595772,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frx5z5/fullscreen_is_better_than_widescreen/,unpopularopinion,1
frx5jf,AdviceAccountCuzICan,Opinionated and forced discussions of feminisn should stay out of the classroom.,"Now, I'd like to start with saying, I dont think feminis is a bad thing, but it should stay out of the classroom. (I would say and all other political topics that are opinion based, but that wouldnt seem like an unpopular opinion, feminisn is the only opinionated topic that doesnt seem to be recognized for being unnecessary in my class)

My freshman year teacher decided to go through an exercise in which we had to raise our hand and say if we are or are not a supportive of the topic, and we had to watch a speech also related to it.

Now, dont get me wrong, personally I think feminisn is a good thing, as long as it isn't taken to annoying or ridiculous extremes, but did we really have to talk about how WE feel about it in class? 

Why cant we learn WHAT it is and stuff like that, a personal political view or opinion shouldn't be discussed in class, only what it means and why its important. To add onto this, why must students even partake in expressing how they feel about something so personal?

If you call me for a ride from the bars or from a friend's house and politely ask me (NOT demand that I owe you and have to do it no matter what) then I damn near 100% of the time will help my friends or family as i disagree with driving intoxicated. When I set certain times that i need you to be home due to me having to get up for work early in the morning (7a.m.) then you better abide by the sober ride's rules. Don't blame me when I decide to leave you at your friend's house because you are being aggressive and do not want to go home. Don't blame me for not cleaning up your puke because you purposely drink too much. Don't blame me that you didn't make it to your bed and slept on the floor because you were fighting me the entire time or such a deadweight it was damn near impossible to move you. Especially when I am smaller than said person. Don't come into my room at 3a.m. Monday morning begging me to call your friends to find your phone and ciggarettes because they dropped you off without checking if you had those items and didn't even check if you got inside before driving off.

People and internet in general have a misconception about introverts being ALWAYS antisocial and shy and this is totally wrong. Being an introvert means you are not too attached to social gatherings and other things like those but does not mean you won't enjoy or can't stand it at all. Introverts are usually good in conversations as they have a lot of content to expose for being observant beings and are valuable in social events. And yes introverts do feel burned out after going out to public places and need time to recover but they're not always like this. When I tell people I'm an introvert they usually go like ""You are totally not! You do socialize so well"", just because I socialize well this doesn't mean I don't prefer spending time with just myself. I hate when I go to internet and people be like ""I don't care if can't go out, as a introvert I never go out"", no you are just a person with socializing problems and that has nothing to do with being an introvert.

When my fellow Brits learn of this they all seem to get jealous ""Oh, WOW, that must of been lovely I hear its such a beautiful place."" Nope. When I got homesick and pined for my relatives my parents would always insist that NZ is a ""nice place to raise children"" turns out NZ is the teenage suicide capital of the world. Another reason they would insist on is ""It's a beautiful country."" But in my experience where the English countryside has hedgerows and Public footpaths where NZ has barbed wire and ""NO TRESPASSING"" signs. The NZ hills are typically steep with lots of landslides and erosion, lots of clay in the soil and overgrown with gorse. While a perk of a walk in the English countryside is finding all sorts of medieval and ancient ruins. Sure there are some mountains and forests in NZ's national parks but that is not where people live, you will live in a boring suburb. A trip from Auckland where most people live and work to Queenstown where all the skiing is no easier or cheaper than a trip from London to Norway or Switzerland. And once you move there you are stuck there, all foreign holidays become long and expensive. The closest foreign holiday you could have Melbourne is the equivalent to a flight from London to Athens. I suppose NZ is not the worse place in the world but I don't understand why anyone would want pay for and endure the long haul flights it takes to get there from anywhere else let alone exile yourself there. Another reason my parents used to give for moving there is ""It has a low population so the food is cheaper."" nope, NZ produce is traded on the international market so you pay just as much for it as you would in London, guess we weren't 18th-century peasants in a Malthusian economy either. When I visit London I see a lot of NZs working there for decades, they always seem to insist that NZ is a ""great place"" I want to ask them ""In that case why are you living in London?"" but the opportunity has not presented itself.

frwmqp,OOOOHHHYEAH,You dont get paid by how neccessary to daily life your job is - you get paid by how hard it is to replace you in particular. And my opinion is that this is natural order of things.,"People who complain that actors or athletes are paid millions per year while a doctor gets paid small fraction of that even thought doctor's job ""is more important"" dont know what they are talking about.

There are plenty of doctors, street cleaners and people who can repair your house/water pipes or car. If one dies they can be immediately replaced by another worker with similar learned skills. It's natural because if someone can replace you any minute you're not important to job provider.

Now on the other hand - who can replace Messi or Ronaldo? Who can replace Connor McGregor? They are not just normal soccer players or mma fighters - these people themselves are a ""brand"".

They are the kind of people you want to advertise your product because they're irreplaceable, widely known and recognized. Meanwhilie a street cleaner can die and he will be replaced the same day because cleaning streets does not require any skill whatsoever. Don't give me shit that you care about some nameless workers you dont even see - remember what happened to this site when Kobe died? This is precisely what im talking about - he was important to people who literally never saw him irl or interacted with him on any level just because he was a brand that was worth more than 10 thousand street cleaners or grocery packers in supermarkets.",9,1585594144,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frwmqp/you_dont_get_paid_by_how_neccessary_to_daily_life/,unpopularopinion,1

You’ve got the disney channel shows with jokes so bad that they need a laugh tape to play.  Youve got Uncle Grandpa walking around in a world of rainbows yelling “ Good Morning “.  You’ve got Spongebob giggling, a starfish without a brain and a crab who wants nothing but money .  None of these shows provide parents any favors when it comes to raising good, respectable, honest people that are gonna positively affect society.  Rewind back  40 50 years. The Andy Griffith show taught kids that it’s the time to get out and have fun while respecting your parents and elders, it taught dads and moms how to parent justly while understanding their kids were inevitably going to make mistakes, and it humanized law enforcement in an appropriate and well meaning way.  The Twilight Zone explored the limits of the imagination.  Scary? yes! Intriguing? absolutely! It created a yearning to discover what was out there! When you glanced out the window you saw that space as a place where anything and everything was a possibility! And then there’s Popey! Encouraging kids to eat their spinach while also demonstrating that it was everyone’s duty to put down evil and a man’s duty to protect women.

frw7z0,Deanothedino,Cussing as a whole is not inappropriate and should be viewed as less offensive and more widely accepted in public,"As with anything moderation is key, but most of us have been there when we either slipped up with a cuss word or cussed mid-sentence or had a friend cuss talking to us and received a look from a stranger in disgust.  

I totally understand that this was the way of thinking growing up and the ""normal"" way of life, but using cuss words helps to emphasize certain topics or moods the way other words cannot.  

But what about the kids? I get it, I have 2 kids, we cuss at our house but try not to direct it at the kids or be irresponsible. That leads me to my point, why are cuss words different than anything else we deem inappropriate for them? We do not want our kids saying things like ""that sucks"" or ""what the heck"", yet we say it, and all of our kids go through a phase when they say the things we do not want them to regardless, why should a cuss word be any different? 

If society as a whole accepted cuss words as ""just another word"" then there would be no real problem. The same rules would apply as any derogatory term, this would not be a pass to bully or to put any human being down, this would be accepting these words as just that, words of emphasis or expression.",22,1585592856,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frw7z0/cussing_as_a_whole_is_not_inappropriate_and/,unpopularopinion,1

As a person who suffers from severe PTSD who has literally tried every drug (multiple times) from shrooms to ketamine to ayahuasca because of partial studies and media sensationalization, I can tell you they do not cure anything and any improvements are small and last a few days/weeks at best. In fact it may cause a lot more harm than any good. They may help you realize stuff, but honestly you can do that in therapy. Also, many drugs definitely aggravated the dissociative aspects of my condition.  No drug can help you cope with your day to day life. You need to learn coping skills and i recommend DBT therapy for that. Talk therapy didn't do much for me but DBT therapy taught me how to live with my issues and handle everyday life. (though medical marijuana was helpful when I was using it)

frw5ls,WickedLSDragon,Not All Interspecies Sexual Contact Is Abusive,"Hey, so after taking some ethics courses and reading a bunch of online debates, I became convinced that sexual contact between species isn't always harmful to the animals. But if you can convince me otherwise, I won't be mad at it. I'll be focusing on mammals seeing as they are more understandable to us and usually are the focus of such a topic. As you can guess, gross content ahead.

TLDR: Animals can consent to do some things. Animals experience pleasure when mating. Animals sometimes choose to proposition humans to mate. This does not logically show where the harm comes into play.

Okay, so to get the semantics out of the way first.

Abuse: Treat (a person or an animal) with cruelty or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.

Consent: Permission for something to happen or agreement to do something.

Now all I start from is 1.) Consenting sexual activity is not inherently harmful or abusive. 2.) Nonhuman animals can consent to certain activities. 

If you agree with me on these two axioms, then here is where I think the logic highway takes us: Animals choose to do things based on what they want or don't want. If forced to do something they don't want, it causes detectable distress that is noticeable in behaviour and in their neurochemistry. When animals do something they want, like eat a steak, they are self rewarded with dopamine and other motivating neurochemicals. Animals typically choose who their mates are, but sometimes the females are forced. Since many animals grow up around humans, they consider them to be a part of the family/herd/pack. So in the animal's mind, if the human displays desirable traits of a partner then that animal would have no qualms propositioning said human. If the human reciprocates in a way that does not physically or mentally harm the animal, it is not more abusive than if the animal did that act with a member of its own species.

I've seen many people compare sexual contact with animals to child abuse. Often it is assumed that GI (general intelligence) is needed to consent and prevent harm in sexual situations. This is untrue. The reason a child is harmed by sexual contact is because they aren't fully developed for it yet. Also many child abusers coerce or threaten their victims in attempts to protect themselves. If this is all done to animals then yes that would be abusive. However It is possible to not coerce or force animals into sexual contact. Often when animals are in season, even the females will be aggressive with their advances on potential mates.

Now size plays a factor in this discussion. A male human and a cat are vastly different in scale. So obvious injury would result. However I suspect there may be a way to provide masturbatory stimulation without causing harm to the animal. There are some vets who recommend this to individuals who have intact cats in order to calm them down during their estrus cycle peak. However adequately sized animals wouldn't experience pain or discomfort from the human partner. This is doubly so for male animals on female humans.

Animals obviously receive pleasure from sex. Most are recorded to have some kind of masturbatory practice, and the seeking out of mates is a strongly motivated behaviour we observe. So saying the animal gets nothing out of it by just following instinct is wrong.

There's my unpopular opinion. Thanks for reading!",32,1585592644,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frw5ls/not_all_interspecies_sexual_contact_is_abusive/,unpopularopinion,1

frw1d5,WatchfulDuck,It is not hard to show sarcasm through text.,"I always see this as the reason people give for thinking they need to use the '/s' tag.

Sarcasm doesn't rely on tone to be conveyed, even if it's sometimes accompanied by it. It relies on context.

The idea behind sarcasm is that a concept is to show how stupid an idea or assumption is by stating it as a simple fact and letting it hang in the air. You don't need to use any sarcastic tone to do that, you can say it completeely deadpan and people will still get it.

If your sarcasm isn't landing it is only because the people you're talking with think you're stupid enough to actually believe the literal meaning. If you know your audience you don't need to and shouldn't use an '/s' tag.

There's a stronger argument for using it in front of strangers, if you're posting on a bigger subreddit, but even then it's ugly. Sarcasm is a stylistic use of language, if you choose to be stylish in your language but then have to follow it with an ugly tag that undoes all that style and more it's not worth it in my opinion.",4,1585592265,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frw1d5/it_is_not_hard_to_show_sarcasm_through_text/,unpopularopinion,1

frw0zf,Aristomeme,Saying you would never date a girl with only fans is a less extreme version of middle eastern cultures where men won’t marry a woman unless they are a virgin.,"In some middle eastern countries, women are considered their husband’s property. If they are not a virgin on their wedding night, they will face severe consequences. It all comes down to those men feeling special their wife is completely theirs. I believe that in America, while men would never openly say they believe women are their “property”, they still have these possessive feelings. 

The topic has recently gained some traction on whether or not men should care if their girlfriends make money through onlyfans. Not surprisingly, most men proclaim that they would never be okay with their girlfriend doing this. I believe that the same ideals that motivate middle eastern thinking are at play here to a lesser extent. If men allowed their girlfriends to sell naked pictures of themselves to other men, they wouldn’t get that special feeling that their woman was totally theirs. 

I do find it funny that the same men who would never allow their girlfriends to make an onlyfans don’t mind that they post pictures of themselves in a bikini on Instagram.

frvzyy,gradinafrica,😂 &lt;--- This emoji sucks,"I have altogether too many friends and acquaintances that use the crying laughing (😂) emoji, some using it almost exclusively for conveying happiness or amusement. I've definitely put too much thought into this, but the crying laughing emoji sucks from almost every angle you look at it:

**1. It's never used as intended**

It should be obvious, but the crying laughing emoji is designed to be used when you are laughing so hard that you're crying. But that's not even close to how most people use it. I got a text from a friend the other day - ""I'm craving [local restaurant] 😂😂😂"" 

If one of these emojis means you're laughing so hard you're crying, *three* should mean you are literally shitting your pants from mirth. There is no world in which the fact someone is craving a restaurant is that funny, even if they have a *criminally* low bar for comedy.

**2. There are better options**

Communication is only effective when both parties are intentional about the work they put into it. Why phone in a description of your 
laughter with 😂 when you can use:

- 🙂 to show a simple smile
- 😊 to show a warm smile
- 😀, 😃, 😄, or 😁 to show a grin
- 😄 or 😆 to show laughter
- 😅 to show embarrassed laughter
- 🙃, 😋, 😜, or 🤪 to show silliness

There are SO MANY OPTIONS. Sticking with the same tired, stale 😂 every time shows such a lack of creativity and/or basic technological literacy that I frankly take it as a bit of an insult if someone sends it to me. Can't be bothered to spend an extra couple seconds picking out something more fitting? Screw you too.

**3. It's poorly designed**

This is a bit pedantic, but who even cries this way? Who leaks two fat, salty tears from the _outer_ sides of their eyes? Every time I look at this monstrosity I feel hate involuntarily welling up inside my soul.

---

Now obviously, there are _some_ situations where it makes sense to use 😂. If you are _actually_ laughing so hard you are crying, for instance. Also, I've seen it used a lot as a meme - that makes sense. I even saw Ken Jennings cover [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Planet-Funny-Comedy-Took-Culture/dp/1501100580/) in it - but that's all about how comedy is an arms race and how we're placing too much importance on it, so that choice makes sense too.

But in most situations, 😂 sucks. Stop using it.

frvga6,Carnagion,"If you believe the government can't be trusted, you're an idiot.","Now before someone points it out, I'm gonna say that I'm not talking about countries where the government has been known to commit atrocities regularly or deny people their rights or just generally be very corrupt. I'm talking about developed, democratic countries where people can *actually* elect their representatives/leaders.

I've seen so many people say ""I don't trust the government"" and then come up with various reasons to justify it. But all of those reasons are useless/dumb.   
When you have the power and the ability to choose your government, why the fuck would you not trust it? It's completely counter-intuitive. *You* chose your fucking government, then you should have a certain amount of trust in it, right? If you don't trust your government then why on earth did you elect it in the first place?

Of course, it goes without saying that no government is absolutely free of corruption and nothing should be taken exactly at face value. I'm not saying you should blindly trust your government no matter what they do; I'm saying stop distrusting them and stop thinking that they're only out to steal all your hard-earned money or something. 

And if your democratically-elected government is so corrupt that you can't trust it, then seriously, you need to think about how that happened.   
Things like ""all the other candidates were worse than this one"" are shitty excuses. If every candidate is a piece of shit and you had to choose the person who was the least shitty, that doesn't allow you to justify why your government is corrupt. All it does is show how useless the system is, and that it needs to change ASAP.   
Saying ""everyone else is an idiot; they voted for the worst possible person"" isn't a reason either. That too simply shows that people are being exploited and tricked by propaganda into believing that something is good for them when it's not. That's not a very good thing either and that means your system really needs to change.

**TL;DR:** In a democratic country where you (actually) elect your own representatives, there is absolutely no excuse for you to not trust your government, and if the candidates are so bad that you had to pick the least bad among them, then that shows that your system is a failure and needs to be changed.",22,1585590439,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frvga6/if_you_believe_the_government_cant_be_trusted/,unpopularopinion,0

Very very rarely is there anything funny in these episodes, and considering how many, boring, recycled jokes that you have to go through it's just not worth the effort. 

If anyone can name me one of these episodes that is actually funny I will be shocked. It's just one of those tropes that needs to die for about 30 years so it can be mostly forgotten and will actually be funny again.

frv9jq,ComeHereDevilLog,Letting people die to save the stock market isn’t necessarily “unethical”.,"Ethics are complicated. From the nicomachean ethics of Aristotle, Kantian ethics, to a basic utilitarian view, none of the decisions being made right now are black and white.

During World War 2 there was a small village occupied by the Nazi’s that had three undercover allied agents in it. They found the agents and tied them to three separate poles and called the mayor. They pulled 1,000 women and children into a massive circle and told the mayor if he didn’t shoot the three men they would shoot the women and children. He agreed, but forgot to load his weapon so they told him he had to beat them to death. He couldn’t do it, and they shot the three men as well as the women and children.

Kantian ethics say he should do nothing as he didn’t cause the situation, and is not ethically responsible for the result.

A utilitarian view would say the sacrifice of the three was justified because it would have saved the rest.

I see a lot of people expressing Kantian ethics right now but I doubt they would hold that stance if they understood taking that viewpoint to its harshest conclusion.

On another note, why was it easier for this man to shoot them, but he couldn’t bring himself to beat them? The result is the same, it’s interesting the means made an ethical difference to him. Maybe we are the same, and some people see the sacrifice as worth it because of the means. Others maybe not, also because of the means.

My point is this: ethics are so fucking complicated it’s silly to draw these lines in the sand and criticize people because they see this from a different perspective than you do.",10,1585589842,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frv9jq/letting_people_die_to_save_the_stock_market_isnt/,unpopularopinion,1

I just feel like the woman does most of the heavy lifting during a pregnancy. I’ve heard people argue against this and say “but the man is the one providing for the family and taking care of her while she’s pregnant” and that’s not always true, I’ve seen people work while pregnant all the time. Also, for a lot of women, after they are done giving birth they will eventually have to get back to work anyways to make ends meet so I don’t agree with this argument. I also feel like there’s a lot of pressure on the mom to birth a perfectly healthy baby with no defects, which I can’t imagine being more stressful for the man. Plus, that shit looks painful! Why should the husband have any say in naming the child when all they have to do is show up. I’ve also heard some men say “well I have to put up with mood her swings” which is just a ridiculous thing to say, that’s the least you can do.",5,1585589206,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frv2bz/the_mother_should_be_the_only_person_allowed_to/,unpopularopinion,1

frusp6,frumpybuffalo,Dominos ruined the two best things they had on their menu - Kickers and Cheesy Bread,"Ok so I know this happened years ago, but I've got some free time and I was reminded of it just now.  Dominos has turd-quality pizza obviously, but their side dish menu used to be the greatest thing.  Growing up, the well-seasoned chicken kickers were delicious on their own, and dipping in ranch made them even better.  Couple that with the original cheesy bread, which had the perfect ratio of cheese to bread, and you didn't even have to order pizza in the first place!

Then, some years ago, they decided to change things (not sure why) and made both of these products arguably worse.  Instead of seasoned chicken kickers, they switched to plain chicken bites and making the ""kicker sauce"" an option.  While this might have imitated the taste well enough, it missed the key component of what made the OG kickers so good -- DIPPING!  By making them plain and forcing you to use the kicker sauce, they make it impossible to dip in anything else due to the highly illegal* nature of mixing dipping sauces.  So now you cannot enjoy the foodgasm of dipping a chicken kicker in ranch.

With the cheesy bread, it was ruined the opposite way--by adding instead of removing.  They decided to take the original cheesy bread and stuff it with MORE cheese and other things, whilst still leaving the cheese on top.  Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of cheese.  A big one.  But once you reach a certain threshold it just becomes overwhelming.  The original cheesy bread was plenty cheesy, but still allowed you to taste the other flavors included.  Now, it just tastes like you're eating a hunk of semi-coagulated cheese.  It's too much, and it's really taken away from my enjoyment of Dominos' side dishes.  Disagree?  That's ok!  Feel free to tell me why in the comments!

frunkp,tpycat,Despite all the conflicts between different sides(R &amp; L) in the west,"America is a rather odd place. People are fighting constantly over things that they can both find common ground on. A lot of the issues they tend to have with each other is based on ego and pride, which is why there's a lot of conflicts. Things like healthcare should be audited and prices publicly available to create a fair market. 

But when it really comes down to it, I think there is some good that can be celebrated by both sides(excluding the corrupt). When it comes to simple things like starting a business, in Silicon valley a lot of people are on the L, and generally have good skills. They try to be more inclusive. Similar to the R but they have the balance of preserving the boundaries of America and making sure people realize that there are problems and foreign nations who want to create conflicts. Most people just want to see their country get better. They let their ego get in the way of what is for all intensive purposes, not a bad place to live. 

I think about other countries and their struggles. I also think about countries that are in economic war with America and honestly I think the one thing Americans should care about is the fact that they can remain patriotic if they get past the artificial divide. A lot of people have it way better than the past to where they can focus on changing things at a local/national level while the federal level deals with foreign threats. That never happened at the scale we see today.

What's often forgotten about today is that despite globalization, there's still a lot of conflicts between nations, and I think people need to learn to come together when it comes to countries that are very aggressive on the geopolitical stage. When you can start acting like a country again, I think a lot of great things can come from it. We're in a decade of strongmen once again, which means there will be more global tensions and a lot of local grievances need to be put aside.",5,1585587910,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frunkp/despite_all_the_conflicts_between_different/,unpopularopinion,1

you just grow up

your facial features, body parts, get bigger and that's it

they proportion of those features doesn't change, its the same, you look the same, just older.

i also hate how this people be posting before and after pictures, like FXCK you look the same

yea maybe you lost some weight, and changed your hairstyle, that don't mean shit

stop trying to flex

so there's no reason to complain that puberty has ruined you, or no reason to be happy that it has hit you like a truck and made you good looking out of nowhere

fruh33,koifishtree,Stop Pitying the Weird/Loner Kids,"For the record, I wouldn't consider myself a weird kid or a loner, or anything of that kind. But I genuinely feel bad for them, **especially when people purposefully pity them but truly don't care to make those kids feel better deep down inside.**

Example. Everyone in my high school class knows there's that one weird kid that hangs out by himself and does weird things(talks differently, lacks social skills e.t.c.), or the super innocent kid and awkward that still looks like a 4th grader. People either ignore them, or there's the popular girls who genuinely don't give a crap about trying to befriend them and dote on them out of pure pity. 

They'll say things like, ""Awww T*immy,* your artwork looks really good."" Believe me, it may sound sweet and all, but you can tell they actually don't care when they say that with this really pathetic and high-pitched voice, then turn back to their friend groups and start talking again in their valley-girl voices. 

Another example, everyone will nominate that one weird kid or the kid-that-doesn't-ever-know-what's going-on-because-he's-too-innocent for homecoming/prom king out of pity. Also don't know why it's always the boys.

I don't think anyone should completely ignore those kids or be superficially sweet to them. They must have feelings too and there's definitely a reason why they are the way they are. It doesn't hurt to try to talk to them some time and be nice, because they are human beings and should be treated equally.",13,1585587341,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fruh33/stop_pitying_the_weirdloner_kids/,unpopularopinion,1

frudzc,level47wizard,"Blaming corporations is just a get out of jail free card for any real solution to combating climate change, and is dangerous to have as the primary goal of climate activism.","The COVID-19 quarantine has shown significant effects on pollution levels around the world \[1\]. Within that article you can see the significant reduction in pollution as high as 40%-60%. If one were to look at the reduction in pollution in California, you can see it is attributed to the average consumer. In fact most of the energy, manufacturing and agriculture industries are still running, deemed essential services at the time of the observation of the pollution change \[2\]. The change in pollution levels is not from big corporations, but the needless consumption of the average citizen in their daily lives.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, within CNN's own article of the effects of C19 on pollution, they show a picture of power plants and industry as if they were the main contributor to pollution. Those factories and power plants were still running the same at that time as they were before C19. Within the climate activism community there seems to be too much of a focus on big evil corporations with evil smoke stack pictures (usually water vapor in reality) that cause the worlds environmental problems. Articles like to blame the corporations such as this one \[3\], which claims 71% of pollution comes from only 100 different companies. What this article does not say is that the study puts the blame for the gas that you buy, and put in your car to burn is cited as ExxonMobil's fault. In reality it is your responsibility as you are the consumer who purchased it. C19 shows the effect of the collective of individual consumers on pollution, vastly outweighing corporations.

&amp;#x200B;

SO WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT:

I am not a ""boot licker"" for big corporations, but I believe this needs to be addressed because I am passionate about the well being of the environment. ""Corporation"" has become the boogeyman of political discourse. We need to remember that corporations are just conglomerates of investors, that serve our consumption interests. They do not profit from extracting oil from the Earth. They profit from selling it to us. The continued  targeting of corporations is only shifting the blame from us. It is easier to blame some entity that we make some connotation about than to accept our own faults. It is crippling any real progress to the climate crisis, as we are targeting what we see as a ""few bad apples"", when in reality, the climate change crisis requires drastic change in YOUR lifestyle. Too much of climate activism focuses on shutting down and regulating big corporations and their ""scary"" smoke stacks, which seem far off from your own personal lives. The pictures of the smoke stacks are not the problem. It is your unnecessary use of cars, taking vacations on planes, use of air conditioning, and daily lifestyles. Legislation, if made, need to target that average American just as much as corporations. Trickle Down Economics has been shown to not work, Trickle Down Climate Activism will not work either.

frucpc,euan-crabtree,Nobody has the right to tell someone else what is and isn't essential to them.,"Since the UK went into lockdown and non-essential travel was banned I've seen a whole bunch of articles where they literally just send a cameraman to a retail park and film people coming out of the shop with cans of paint or new plates or clothes. Putting aside the hypocrisy of sending a team of journalists around the country to snoop on people for ""non-essential"" travel, I think it's just plain wrong to shame people for buying things that are going to make their quarantine a bit less miserable.

We can't stop the world around us just because we're stopping our world. Try explaining to the dog that you've already had your daily ration of exercise when it's scratching at the door because it needs a dump, or explaining to a screaming child that they can't have chicken nuggets because you already did your food shop and the government said that going to the shop just for nuggets is non-essential.

Also, there are more needs than just physical. Food and medicine is the bare minimum, but if people are going to be stuck indoors for 3 months or more then they need a little more than that. If someone doesn't have a good workspace at home (likely most of us), I'd say that a pot of paint, a lamp and a new desk is essential for a space that they will be spending 8 hours a day in for the foreseeable future.

I think the overwhelming majority of people are generally sensible and understand the situation that we're in, but they need to luck after their intellectual, emotional and social needs as well. If buying a new TV makes them stay sane for another few days, and they observe social distancing while buying it, I don't see the problem.",2,1585586953,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frucpc/nobody_has_the_right_to_tell_someone_else_what_is/,unpopularopinion,1
fruc2s,TyreezyTheKidd,The Amazon hate train is ridiculous,"I believe that people hate on Amazon mostly because it is a large corporation. I often see people on Reddit say that Amazon workers deserve more money and that the working conditions are bad, which really baffles me.

&amp;#x200B;

The minimum wage here in California is 12 dollars. Amazon workers usually make $15. Plus health care with employer contributions. Plus a 401(k). Plus overtime and a fair amount of paid and unpaid time off. For a job that you need absolutely no skills to be hired into. Those are nice benefits for a job that pretty much anyone can get.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never worked at Amazon so I can't speak from experience, but everyone I know that works at Amazon says it isn't bad at all. I'm inclined to believe people that actually work there more than people assuming it's bad on the internet. Also, it's a warehouse. Warehouses have never been known to have luxurious working conditions, so I think it's likely that any problem a worker has at Amazon will be found at any other warehouse.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, look at Amazon's response to the coronavirus. If you don't feel safe going in to work, no problem. They're letting you stay at home without risk of being fired. It is unpaid, but at least the choice is yours to make. For those that still wish to work, the pay has increased to $17/hr and they have started offering double time pay for overtime. I'm sure someone's going to say ""why don't they just offer that all the time then"", but keep in mind that this is a completely unskilled job.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what everyone is expecting from Amazon, but it seems like a pretty good deal from my perspective.",66,1585586895,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fruc2s/the_amazon_hate_train_is_ridiculous/,unpopularopinion,1

fru9pt,mydadsnameisharold,Captain America is the worst avenger.,"That goody-goody bullshit is so annoying. His patriotic aesthetic is major cringe. 

Everything about him is annoying as hell. 

His powers aren't that cool. He's fast and strong and has a vibranium shield. BORING. 

Shuri/ Iron Man/ Spider Man/ Black Panther/ Bruce Banner are all way smarter, and they've got cooler gear/ more interesting powers. 

&amp;#x200B;

And more importantly they're character motivations are more multi dimensional. Captain america has no inner conflicts. He's static as a motherfucker. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's about as boring and 'meh' as hawk-eye and Falcon, but he's worse because of the patriotic crap and cloyingly virtuous nonsense. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't hate the actor who portrayed him in the movies, but I hate that character in the movies. Constantly thinking he's infallible. He's like the pope of super heroes. Not very cool. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only interesting iteration of Captain America I've ever heard of was ""The Nomad"", apparently in the comics he spent some time fighting evil as he saw it, instead of fighting evil wrapped up in a star spangled banner. He rejected the name ""captain america"" because of some ethical conflict with the United States of America. 

&amp;#x200B;

And that made him briefly cool. Because blind nationalism is stupid and cringey and (from a story telling standpoint) him rejecting that briefly made his character more dynamic.",25,1585586680,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fru9pt/captain_america_is_the_worst_avenger/,unpopularopinion,1

Or at least “The Handmaid’s Tale” isn’t her best work.,"Recently, I read 1984 (great book), then I decided to read The Handmaid’s Tale (not so great book) since my friend had been reading it, and I needed to read it for class next semester anyway. It was so disappointing. I understand what she was trying to do, but it felt like she was typing every other word into thesaurus.com in order to dress up her sentences/descriptions. I was uncomfortable reading it, and some people say it was written that way on purpose, and I know what they mean, but I wasn’t uncomfortable in the way Atwood probably intended, I was uncomfortable because it felt like reading a fan fic on watt pad in public. The whole thing felt like a bit of a 1984 rip off, but maybe that’s just bias. And the ending was bullshit. I haven’t read the sequel, yet, and I don’t intend to until I get a couple of reads in between, but I just dislike seeing all the praise for this book in particular, given that there’s so many better authors going unrecognized.

fru6id,Pirate_Pete1312,Choice is completely overrated,"People seem to claim that more choice we have the better: Choice of subjects to be taught at school, hotel to stay at or even tinned tomatoes in a supermarket; the more choice we have of these things, the happier we are. I think that's stupid. Surely we know from our own experience that choice is only good in moderation, and too much of it is paralysing. 

If there's 20 different Mexican restaurants in town, then theoretically I should be happier since I've got more options. In reality though, it's so much harder to make this choice since I'm now totally responsible for my own satisfaction, and any fault in the restaurant I choose will be entirely down to me. ""You have no one to blame but yourself you idiot, you should've spotted that they wouldn't serve re-fried beans with the nachos"" I will think in my self-absorbed first world misery.

If, however, my town has two Mexican restaurants and only one of them is open, I can enjoy my outing so much more, since if it doesn't live up to my standards for fine Mexican dining then I can quite easily claim that it's not my fault, and move on. It's completely fair game to complain about, and I don't have to take any kind of responsibility for my own poor choices.

That's how it should work everywhere. If I come out of school unable to get a job anywhere because I didn't take the right subjects, or my holiday is ruined because the hotel didn't have a balcony, or my casserole comes out tasting funny because I bought the wrong brand of tinned tomatoes, I don't want to even have to consider the notion that it may of been a bit my fault.",6,1585586400,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fru6id/choice_is_completely_overrated/,unpopularopinion,1

frtx3z,Valsana,There needs to be more thought into animal testing being acceptable or not,"I'm against it animal testing, with a few types being acceptable to me because anyone with an IQ above room tempertaure can see its nit cruel.

Everytime I mention it all I get is ""yea they are experimented  on with drugs or surgery or anything else but they are treated so well"", or ""I worked in a lab but they seemed so happy and I thought they were cute and I gave them names and I loved them"" or ""shut up crying you should be thankful they gave their lives"", as if the animals aren't bred for the purpose of testing. 

I really don't care what people say about their ethical considerations. I think breeding them to do research and live in captivity for what will typically be human benefit is disturbing and somehow people make up some idea that it is always a heavenly setting for the animals. Hell if you dare mention that doing the EXACT same, in every single way to a person they suddenly become hypocrites saying its cruel, unusal, unethical and inhumane. Its complete bullshit. I've great respect for people who have used themselves as a model for research knowing that they could be harmed. How can it be ""extremely ethical"" to research on a sheep, mouse, bird, fish, dog or whatever be completely ethical yet no matter what the research was its nearly always evil to do anything to a person, knowing fully well the person will be treated better in everyway? 

I don't actually care what the benefit to humanity is. Normally theres some kind of thanks to the animal's sacrifice as if the animal was a willing subject. It wasn't, it was bred for this. Thats the truth of it. A new drug wasn't made due to an animal sacrificing itself, it was made because some human got some and tested on dozens of them against their will. 

I've not heard one reason to what makes it right either. Anything from they treat them reasonable well to knowing the animals genetic make up and entire lifespan  speeds up the process doesn't mean anything to me. That doesn't justify it, thats why its done, not what makes it right.

As with most things in life the majority of people who have an opinion on it aren't even the ones doing the research. So if you do work in a lab and take as much care as possible with animals, fair enough, you know exactly what particular research goes on in that building and act approriately.",36,1585585569,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frtx3z/there_needs_to_be_more_thought_into_animal/,unpopularopinion,1

frtuat,Bant3r99,Prostitution should be legal,"Hear me out. Pimps should be illegal. Child prostitutes should be illegal. That’s not what I’m talking about here. What I’m saying is we should bring back brothels. I’m talking about a taxable business transaction between two consenting adults. (21+) All adults involved should be tested for STDs and hard drugs like meth and heroin. They should have a clean environment to provide these services and be allowed to hire protection as needed.  They should also be allowed to travel to different locations if they so choose. Customers should be required to pass a background check (for violent crimes) and keep a credit card on file for security purposes. Whether you agree with prostitution or not, you must be aware that it’s going to happen regardless. What I’m proposing is simply a shift in the industry that would make it less dangerous for everyone involved while simultaneously boosting the economy. If responsible adults had a safe place to practice as a legitimate profession it would also be much easier to catch pimps who are forcing under age girls/boys into the streets.",162,1585585321,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frtuat/prostitution_should_be_legal/,unpopularopinion,1

frtt6r,Mizkoff,"The US Judicial System is absolutely fucked, there needs to be more than one judge presiding over every case, and trial by jury of peers is borderline unfair","Just finished watching The Staircase, and holy shit, what a mess. Aside from the horrendous issues with the prosecution, (ranging from capitalizing on fabricated evidence to actually witholding exculpatory evidence in an attempt to create an emotionally driven narrative presenting MP as the killer), the judge allowing clearly prejudicial information to be used as evidence (where was the oversight??), I'm just astounded by the issue of the jury. I understand that these people are selected by the lawyers, and I understand the potential benefits to this type of jury, but at the end of the day I want to be judged by legal professionals who have spent YEARS training to look at the facts and put their personal biases aside, not Average Joe's who legitimately run the risk.of not knowing that Not Guilty is NOT THE SAME as innocent. When there is reasonable doubt, you MUST acquit. A jury needs to put their biases aside, be able to appropriately judge emotional eye witness testimony, and should have enough critical thinking ability to the degree that they can recognize bad science/ evidence when it's presented for consideration. 

This doc really highlights the failures of the judicial system, and it's honestly heartbreaking.

Now, i understand that what the lady did is bad. Claiming money that is not yours is bad But on the other hand nothing would've happen if the video guy minded is own business.

What this video is telling me is this:
Let me plant fake money on the ground to caught someone that hasn't done anything wrong yet and that if i record it myself catching this person that I trapped by making this situation happen i will be a hero to the eyes of others for showing this bad person.

This is totally ridiculous. Dont credit yourself because you caused a situation that could've not been bad if you only decided to mind your own business.

But then again, i guess sometimes its too much to ask.",1,1585583998,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frtf5q/i_hate_videos_showing_people_how_bad_they_are/,unpopularopinion,1

frt6f5,TheFantasticXman1,People complaining about the amount of handicapped parking spots are so entitled.,"You're mad that the 20 remaining spots at Walmart are handicapped and you'll either have to circle the car park until an available regular spot is open or park a little further away from the store? Guess what? Tough! You can walk that extra mile! Many disabled folk can't.

Whilst sometimes the amount of disabled parking spot can be a bit excessive, I'm totally not against them being there. My parents don't get mad when there's no parking and the only available spaces are handicapped ones. They just kiss their teeth and wait for an available one. They're not whiny crybabies who hate being inconvenienced. I don't care that there's practically no parking at my uni for regular people and 95% of the parking is either for staff or blue badge holders (UK version of a placard) (and not that I would care anyway as I don't own a car nor can I even drive). 

If you search ""handicapped parking"" on this sub, you get some of the most outrageous views on disabled people. It really makes my blood boil despite me not being disabled nor knowing anyone who  would need a blue badge. 

Just treat those empty handicapped spots like they don't exist when the rest of the car park is full and wait for a space to open. Because when that happens to me (when I'm with my parents of course as like I said, I don't drive), that's exactly what I do.

frt34y,co0p3r,"IPA is a horrible style of beer, but it's so fashionable that nobody dares say so.","I've been a homebrewing enthusiast for a number of years now and can honestly say that I've got a basic working knowledge of beer styles and can knock out a decent brew.  
One thing that still eludes me though is how people can honestly like something as astringent and just downright offensive as the experience of drinking an IPA, or any similar style of beer with such an absurdly high IBU count.  
There seems to be a weird culture within the homebrew scene that MOAR HOPSES = better beer.  That whole ""huuurduuur I'm such a hop-head"" mindset is total cringe to me as there is just so much more subtly and nuance to beer than stripping the enamel off your teeth with something that tastes like diving face-first into a burning pine tree.  And don't tell me that I just haven't had the *right* IPA yet.  I've tried many, some quite famous, and the only difference I've been able to discern is some are just marginally *less* repulsive than others.  

To me it's the basic bro of the craft beer world.  The dude's equivalent of a pumpkin spice latte while posting pics of your new Ugg boots on Instagram along with a monologue on how much you love autumn.  It's one of the easiest things to brew, because the tsunami of hops drowns out flavours that would reveal mistakes in the brewing process, much like a lousy electric guitarist can hide a fair amount of poor playing technique in a distortion pedal.  
It gets way too much unquestioning adoration in the craft scene and I'm just sick of it.

frszas,DivineRainor,LaTeX is just a way to make people bad at writing feel smart about writing an essay,"Maybe too specific for this place but I absolutely hate LaTeX as a word processing format. For anyone who doesn't know LaTeX is the defacto way of writing anything in STEM subjects, and to dumb it right down it basically involves coding your formatting into your essay. Sure there are templates and things like overleaf to help get it done, but as a staunch Word user I have never seen what the appeal of this is.

I have a running joke with some of my friends of ""LaTeX is great for \_\_\_\_\_\_, and very good at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ "" because no one has been able to tell me so far why its superior to just using a word template. People like to say its better because it lets your write equations better, or it keeps track of figures, but these are all things that word has done for years, as well as the fact that if you think the way that LaTeX does symbols and equations is better, theres now an option in word to just type out the equation like its in LaTeX.

Which brings me to the crux of my title. This might just be my personal opinion, but the level of literacy/ writing ability amongst a lot of students on the sciences does not seem on average to be the best, yet I get many people exicitedly telling me ""LaTeX is great"" whilst being incredibly non specific as why its actually doing the job better than a word document. Which leads me to this idea that people love it because its making them feel clever, they're ""solving/coding"" an essay rather than just writing it.

Thats just my opinion on it anyway coming from a very salty man who has just written three of my final year reports in word and has had everyone who's walked past me in the department go ""Hnnngh, why arn't you writing it in LaTeX, its soooo much better"", why don't you bugger right off and let me write it whatever software I want, or better yet actually explain why.",16,1585582539,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frszas/latex_is_just_a_way_to_make_people_bad_at_writing/,unpopularopinion,1

When people think of portraying confidence it’s almost certainly related to someone being confident in their skin. That’s all well and good, and I’m not trying to say that being told you’re unattractive isn’t hurtful. However, I think being funny or being smart are both more valuable traits than being attractive. Therefore, being told you lack those traits is worse than lacking attractiveness. When you’re smart or funny people enjoy being around you more than if you’re just attractive. You’ll appeal to a wider array of people. If there’s no substance the shine of your sex appeal dulls way faster than the intrigue of spending time with someone who makes you laugh or someone who promotes thought with profound insight.

You think that it’s the people’s money and that their employers should keep their hands off of it.

BUT, this money is relief money. The money is meant to help people who might not have had saving and lost their income and have no means to endure a quarantine. If you still have a job and are making money, the check isn’t really for you. Your employer actually needs it more and giving it to them is a tiny bit good for you.

Companies are struggling greatly and not every company is going to be getting relief money. If the place you work at is keeping you employed through this, feel lucky. You’re still making money, you still have your job, and you’re more secure with where you’ll be when this pandemic is over. Letting your employer take some of your relief money helps it save money and gives it a better chance at surviving this time.

I know that's how news is supposed to run, I don't think there's any way to make bad news tolerable, but the sudden change of expressions and atmosphere just always striked me as odd. Like we're still trying to process the amount of people who died in that cyclone, you don't have to paint the screen with rainbows immediately after.

Probably just overthinking it but I also have a huge problem with media coverage. Selena gomez isn't wearing makeup during quarantine? That's nice, but what about the fucking huge rise in covid-19 cases and the devastation from the bushfires in australia, ebola still exists, millions of people are about to lose their jobs and homes and might not be able to buy food for their children, the impending stock market crash, chinese people are being horribly discriminated and even stabbed, I could go on.

Anyway, every news source is biased to some degree, whether that be progressive or conservative, and the order in which the stories are presented is uncomfy.",0,1585582166,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frsv6f/the_sudden_switch_from_bad_news_to_good_news_is/,unpopularopinion,1

frsu8c,ThiccaryClinton,Urban density won’t fix climate change. It’s been abused by landowners who profit from controlling you.,"More often, I’ve been seeing academics (mostly vegan grad students) obsessing with urban density. “Abolish the car!” they say, ignoring the joy and freedom it brings to people like myself, who hate riding public transport with plebs. These are the people who can’t parallel park and want everyone else to change their lives because of their own failures.

1. ***Density is a catalyst for pandemics***
&gt; If you order delivery food, which many do, then the entire supply chain has many moving parts, all of which are potential contamination points: the ingredients, the cook, the prepper, the driver, your neighbors who touch the elevator. All of them could infect you and you wouldn’t know who to blame. If it’s airborne, you could get infected just by sitting your apartment and some pleb being outside sneezing on your air conditioning unit, at least if you’re on the first floor.

2. ***Urban heat island effect***
&gt; Even with advances in building materials, the concrete roads and sidewalks absorb heat. Exacerbating this heat, air conditioning units are a simple equation: heat exchange causes cool air inside by creating hot air outside. What we’ve seen in India, now that they can afford these very inefficient units, is that when everyone uses them, it gets noticeably hotter outside, snowballing into an increase demand for everyone. Where prior, you could get away without one, now you need one because everyone else has one and they’re making it hotter outside.

3. ***Energy***
&gt; Despite advances in nuclear, which may alleviate much of this, not all urban environments are advanced enough to maintain or afford it. If we used solar and wind, then we’d lose a chunk of energy due to friction, as it travels long distances. If more people (not everyone) we’re to spread out in suburbs, supported by high speed rail networks, then we could power homes with micro-grid solar and wind, alleviating the power needs of the city itself.

4. ***Water***
&gt; The most important and least discussed on this list, water is the limiting variable for capacity. Not only does 70% of water go to food production, but clean potable water is in limited supply. More so than ever, as greedy corporations pollute or hoard water. Under a 2 degree temperature projection, the soil moisture deficit will spread, preventing life in many places from continuing, forcing people into the city. The city will become over strained for water and eventually run out. We can talk about sustainable agriculture, such as hydro/aquaponics which use 90% less water, but but it’s expensive and won’t be enough. Desalination is expensive as well, and we still haven’t figured out what to do with brine. 

5. ***Biophillia***
&gt; Humans crave nature. We are animals. We only started living in conditioned buildings mostly the past centuries, unconditioned buildings for a fraction of our existence. Why is PETA so obsessed with keeping animals out of tight cages but not humans? If it’s in**humane** to keep an animal in such a small space that it can’t roam around, what makes those exact same people think it’s okay to put a human in a studio apartment with one window? We are not designed for that.",10,1585582081,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frsu8c/urban_density_wont_fix_climate_change_its_been/,unpopularopinion,3

frssrk,EyeArDum,Ads that appeal more to the audience like having a puppy but don’t show the product or tell us anything about what the product is or does are terrible,"I understand Super Bowl/seasonal ads which are made specifically for ads and can genuinely be funny. But throughout all the other 10 months of the year (depending on how long said Super Bowl/seasonal ads air) any company should at least make an attempt to tell us about the product.

The Mtn Dew ads that just show people skateboarding are some of the most boring ads out there, at least Mtn Dew kickstart showed in some way how it kickstarted the people while also being funny. The [original ad](https://youtu.be/wMoKcocpXh4]) was the talk of my household for months.

That Pringle’s ad with Bill Hader showing us that we’ve been eating them wrong the entire time, that was a great ad as not only was it funny (Bill Hader is always a plus) but it also showed us something about Pringle’s that I’m sure at least 80% of people didn’t know or do.

Insurance ads of any sort usually give one or more cryptic things about their plans and then have something that tries to be funny. The only one I’ve seen in the past year that was funny was October 2019 Geico with the attic of mannequins, I get it because it’s Halloween, and while generic ads are boring I think I might be a little bit more interested in Geico/General/State Farm/Farmers/Aflac/Progressive/whatever other companies I’m missing if they would actually say something about the plans or charging rates or just SOMETHING besides “15% or more on Car Insurance.”

I could go on all day about this but I doubt anyone has read this far, just bring a point to the table and I’ll either add on to it or add a counterpoint and make it interesting.",2,1585581936,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frssrk/ads_that_appeal_more_to_the_audience_like_having/,unpopularopinion,3

Whenever I take a break in between time spent working on something, it's not that comforting knowing that in a short span of time the break will be over and I'll have to go back to doing it again. I just want to get it done, then I'll have a much longer and more enjoyable break afterwards. The exception to this is whenever I'm working on a project I start and work on myself, then obviously I can do it whenever I want to. But for important work, I'd rather get it all done in one sitting than have to take breaks in between.

frsshz,MechanicWings,Romanticizing the introvert culture has gotten out of control. Also it's annoying as hell.,"I get it. You feel solitude when you're alone, feel awkward when you're with people and think that a book is better than a social gathering. Cheers mate, you do you. What irritates me is the romanticization of the introverts, like they are some kind of vigilantes who fight against the rules of the evil society. You're not fighting against anything! Just tell your friends you don't want friends!


Also it makes some extroverts feel bad about themselves. Like they will never experience that peaceful feeling of being happy just by yourself. WHICH IS NORMAL. It's normal to want social interactions, it's normal to want to go to parties and it's normal to prefer a meeting with friends than Netflix or a book by yourself. 


Don't get me wrong - I'm not talking about the people who want to find social connections and are unable to, I'm talking about the people who are unwilling to.


Introvert romanticization is the worst. They're not heroes, they're not in a struggle and they're not fighting against anything.

frsrlr,Neetieoff,"In romantic relationships, men get the most pressure","It’s not a competition but honestly? I’m making this post because I’ve been seeing a lot of « simp » memes lately and it’s pissing me off. Men are criticized no matter the way they treat women, specifically their girlfriend. You’re a man? You have to provide otherwise you’re cheap and selfish. You provide for your girlfriend? it means you want to control her financially! You’re jealous when she talks to other guys? That’s so toxic! You don’t care that she talks to other men? Man up, women deserve real alpha males!!1! Men are told to treat women like princesses, and now they’re called simps and white knights when they do, even if there’s some form of wanting to impress and court the woman, what’s the harm? Women on the other hand are told to *behave* like precious princesses who deserve the absolute best, and everytime a woman is happy with a man, her friends might threaten the man in disgusting ways such as « I’ll chop his dick off if he hurts you ». Imagine this situation reverse. Yeah, not cool. Women are excused by society if they cheat because « maybe she was lonely, he didn’t treat her right» (not saying she’s excused by her boyfriend but it’s not frowned upon as much as if a man cheats). Sexual life wise, I’m watching a reality tv show with couples and shit. There are couples where the man is upset his gf won’t sleep with her, and all of the fans call these men creeps. One couple was reverse. The man who refused to sleep with her gf was called gay, weak, a p*ssy...

The pressure we get is only related to children, mothers get more pressure than fathers, but husbands? They get more pressure than wives.

frsl9r,ohSHITderheis,Catholic priests are generally pretty good people,"So I’m not religious at this point, but I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school for many years. I have met a lot of Catholic priests throughout my life. 

Now I know the predominant view on reddit and most other places is that Catholic priests are just old, bitter, child molesting, fascist, cult leaders. 

In my experience most of them are actually pretty good guys. They tend to be well-spoken, educated, and overall friendly. They are almost always very welcoming and will talk to complete strangers. If you need a funeral or a wedding, they will be the first ones there to help you figure it out. If someone is dying in the hospital, they’ll usually drag themselves out of bed in the middle of the night to go see them and pray with/for them. They’ll usually give you confession at a moment’s notice and will give you all kinds of relationship advice as well as spiritual advice, and are usually pretty understanding and nonjudgmental. And they generally live pretty frugal lives, despite the view of them as thieves. 

I’ve even known several of them that are fine with drinking, cussing, or smoking here and there. Not all of them are uptight fuddy duddies. 

Now I know, some priests are assholes, as with any religion or class of people. Not all of them live up to what I just described. And some of them are good people that simply screw up here and there. And sure, they’re probably gonna give you a little shit if you go to get married and you’re already living together, because it’s their job. 

And obviously I’m sure some of you have had bad experiences with priests. There will always be predators and parasites of society willing to take advantage of an authority position.

frsfcu,terrasaurjs,"I hate bodily functions, including my own","My metabolism is amazing, so thankfully pooping is extremely quick for me (not much longer than peeing). Since I’m done so fast and flush it away, there isn’t enough time for it to stink up much which is a blessing because if I’m in there too long, I’ll get so grossed out. 

The smell or sight of my own poop is enough to make me want to throw up. I make sure to always use my bidet or wet wipe and sometimes even shower to make sure absolutely zero poo residue is left.

I also will never poop outside of my own house if a private bathroom isn’t available. I will hold it in for days if necessary.

I also despise peeing. It’s so boring and it interrupts me constantly. Peeing is my eternal burden. I used to hold it in until I got my first UTI, yay.

If I throw up, I can’t clean it up myself or I’ll keep throwing up due to previous puke. Non-ending cycle. 

I also never sneeze, I hate it. I’ll hold them in by covering my nose, works 99.99% of the time.

I’m also not much of a farter, I think it’s partly my metabolism but mainly my clean diet. I’m human so I still fart occasionally but I’ll never push them out myself. 

I love burping though, it’s so satisfying.

Note: not sure if it counts but I also never pick my nose,,, but I do tend to pick my ears. But I never ever look or smell at anything if ,for any reason, I do pick around (which is rare).

I love listening to music and it makes me genuinely happy, but the dynamics, instrumentation, melodies etc are what makes something sound catchy or enjoyable to listen to, rather than vocals. It seems that vocals are more prominent in what you pay attention to when played at the same volume as everything else, which might be because of some evolutionary shizzlewizzle or something. Another issue is that vocals tend to be mastered the loudest relative to most instruments, so when removed it is easier to hear the range of sound in whatever it is you were listening to.

frrvox,RosselWestbrook,The phrase “life’s not fair” is hypocritical and ignores the underlying problem in society.,"Let me provide you with a two sided example based off of my school. 
- Fist some context: The poverty rate in my town is 90%. Most of the parents who should/can be working are not and are on welfare. Drugs are also very prevalent here. We have a program at our school that allows students with limited financial support to get free lunch at school whereas the other students pay 2.75. 
 
-First example: Why do the kids of parents that don’t work get free meals? Why are parents who have jobs using their money to buy food for their kids when parents who probably spend what money they have on drugs don’t have to work or pay for lunch? How is that fair for the hard-working parents? Most common answer: “Life’s not fair.” And that is that

Second example: Why do the kids who have working parents get to live knowing that they will always have a roof under their heads? Why do they get the guarantee of food on the dinner plate? Why do kids of parents who spend all their money on drugs have to find ways to eat food/have shelter? How is that fair for the poverished kids? Most common answer: “Life’s not fair.” And that is that

- I get it. We can’t create a perfect society where everyone has the very same opportunities. It’s simply not possible. But that should be what we are striving to be doing. Simply saying “life’s not fair” ignores the issue and sets it aside, when we should be figuring out what isn’t fair about it and strive to fix it so it is fair.

frrvfa,sterlinii,Rape is more prevalent with men,"Despite what you may have heard in your life, there are still more male rapists due to higher rates of male on male rape compared to female on female rape. This I agree with, **however** neither stat is very high in absolute terms. Contrary to what you've probably heard in the past, most men are not raped by other men. **80% are raped by women (sources below).** More men in total are raped every year than women, making sexual assault more of a men's issue than a women's issue.

Several decades ago in fact, there was an early gender studies ""researcher"" named Mary Koss proposed that a person **""forced to penetrate""** was declared to another person that it is not in fact rape. She called it unwanted sexual contact and Mary Kross was VERY successful in convincing academics and even lawmakers to adopt this definition.While technically it is gender neutral, due to the anatomical differences between men and women, it mainly applied to men. Her rationale was that men must ""want it"" or are ""asking for it"" so it doesn't count.

As a result of this, the actual true rate of sexual assault against men is usually hidden in official statistics. **Instead of rape, they call it ""made to penetrate""**. In fact, many state and national laws around the world similarly define rape in gendered terms, meaning female rapists avoid prosecution and generally don't get discussed in the media. This has led to decades of misinformation on the topic. And it has only just recently started getting attention, both on the legal front, and among academics.

frrr5s,sterlinii,Rape affects men more than woman according to well published sources.,"Despite what you may have heard in your life, there are still more male rapists due to higher rates of male on male rape compared to female on female rape. This I agree with, **however** neither stat is very high in absolute terms. Contrary to what you've probably heard in the past, most men are not raped by other men. **80% are raped by women (sources below).** More men in total are raped every year than women, making sexual assault more of a men's issue than a women's issue.

Several decades ago in fact, there was an early gender studies ""researcher"" named Mary Koss proposed that a person **""forced to penetrate""** was declared to another person that it is not in fact rape. She called it unwanted sexual contact and Mary Kross was VERY successful in convincing academics and even lawmakers to adopt this definition.While technically it is gender neutral, due to the anatomical differences between men and women, it mainly applied to men. Her rationale was that men must ""want it"" or are ""asking for it"" so it doesn't count.

As a result of this, the actual true rate of sexual assault against men is usually hidden in official statistics. **Instead of rape, they call it ""made to penetrate""**. In fact, many state and national laws around the world similarly define rape in gendered terms, meaning female rapists avoid prosecution and generally don't get discussed in the media. This has led to decades of misinformation on the topic. And it has only just recently started getting attention, both on the legal front, and among academics.

frrmsv,Neetieoff,People label people as « toxic » too easily,"There’s a fine line between a toxic person and a person you don’t get along with. I know a toxic woman. She uses the same pattern of manipulation and emotional guilt trip with everyone, and as a result everyone ends up feeling the same way about her. Toxic people only cause harm to those around them and use specific methods to keep people to be their friends. But it became a trend to say that for example your ex was a narcissist because he was jealous. Some people are more possessive than others because they may have trust issues, but if there’s no threats or emotional guilt trip it’s not toxic, it’s a personality trait and doesn’t make them control freak toxic narcissists. NPD is a mental illness that needs a diagnosis btw, and even if someone abuses you it doesn’t mean they’re a narcissist.  People also say to cut out the toxic negative fake friends out of your life, but toxic negativity is constantly putting you down when you’re happy and discouraging you in your projects. If a friend isn’t necessarily as enthusiastic as you about things, it’s how they are and it doesn’t make them toxic. You can ditch them without going after everyone saying how you used to have such a toxic friendship with them. I know it sounds oddly specify but I genuinely hear this regularly from people who describe things that aren’t toxic or abusive at all, and it’s nearly disrespectful for those who received abuse or were in a toxic relationship before.

frrlng,Rapscallion94,The Catholic Church is not and should not be considered a part of the Christian Church,"This one might get me killed. It'll probably be a long one too.

Before I state the claim I'm putting forth let me first state some presuppositions. If you do not agree with these presuppositions that is ok. Just understand that I personally do and will base my argument off of these. This post is in no way meant to prove any of these true. I will save that for another time.

Firstly, any truly born again Christian will submit to the Bible as the main authority for their life. They will believe that every part of it is true. They will seek to study and memorize it daily, obey its commands and believe in its promises. I'll tack on another presupposition here: If you are to believe the Bible you must believe in trinitarian theology. The idea that there is one God in three distinct persons. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. They are all the same God but they are different persons.

Secondly, every born again Christian must be saved by hearing the Gospel from someone else, or directly from reading about it in the Bible.

Thirdly, The Gospel in short is this: God created Adam and Eve; they sinned against God by disobeying him ([Genesis 3:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A6&amp;version=CSB), [Romans 5:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A12&amp;version=CSB)). Because of their sin all humanity now falls short of God and his commands   
 ([Romans 3:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&amp;version=CSB)). God then sent his son Jesus to live a perfect life ([1 John 3: 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3%3A5&amp;version=CSB)) that we failed to do, and died a death meant for us ([1 Peter 3:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3%3A18&amp;version=CSB)). Thus becoming the atonement for our sin and buying a way for us to be reconciled with God through faith in Christ ([Romans 3:23-25](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23-25&amp;version=CSB), [Ephesians 2: 8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9&amp;version=CSB)).

Now on to the claim.

The Catholic church should not be considered a part of Christianity even while claiming to worship and serve the God from the Bible. The fact is that if one were to study the theology of the Catholic Church, especially their stance on the salvation which is one of the core beliefs of Christianity, one would see that they differ from their Protestant counterparts. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0uVWgIH410) is a video that I feel summarizes the Catholic stance on salvation fairly well. There are other sources I could post but they are not nearly as digestible as this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I think there are quite a few things Mr. Yasinksi states in this video that are actually true such as: God's unconditional love (He loves us in spite of ourselves, not because we are so great [John 3:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A16&amp;version=CSB)), Yasinksi is also correct that salvation is not unconditional but salvation is a specific process revealed by God.

However, there are several things that Yasinksi also gets wrong. He states that there is no sin that can keep us from God, which is mostly true except in one instance, blaspheming of the Holy Spirit ([Mark 3: 29](https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/mark/3-29.html)). While that is a different subject all together, I include it as an example of how Catholics will completely ignore aspects of the Bible in favor for others.

Let's continue with Yasinksi's false teachings according to salvation. I will critique each of his 3 points with 3 of my own.

&amp;#x200B;

1. He states that salvation firstly involves belief AND baptism. While this is a common belief in other ""denominations"" of Christianity (the likes of which I would also call false teachers along with Catholics) it is none the less false. While there are verses such as [Mark 16:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A16&amp;version=CSB) or [1 Peter 3: 21](https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/1-peter/3-21.html) that seem to out right say baptism saves you, we must understand the greater context in which they are being said. This is a basic principle of hermenuetics. In [1 Peter 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+3&amp;version=CSB), Peter writes comparing baptism to the flood and Noah's Ark. Here he states that just as the ark saved them through water, Baptisms now saves us as a pledge of a good conscious. This seems fine, baptism must save us then. However,  if we believe the whole Bible is true then it must not contradict itself in any way so this understanding should fit right in with other statements on salvation the Bible makes. A problem arises when you start reading other portions of the Bible however. For example read [Ephesians 2: 8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9&amp;version=CSB) again. This clearly states that we are saved by grace through faith and not of works. so if the Bible is true how do you reconcile these statements? Well the easiest way and one that seems to easily line up with the totality of scripture is to understand two key things: 1.) If one truly wants to get baptized because he knows it will be pleasing to God then that is coming from faith and baptism is merely an outward expression tied to that faith. 2.) In the early church era baptism was not viewed like it is now. Being baptized back then was essentially a death sentence, you were willingly taking on persecution, disownment, and possibly being killed. You would not sign up for that unless you truly believed in what was being preached by the Apostles. With that in mind Peter can speak in a way that seemingly makes baptism a requirement because essentially the only people who will do it at the time of his writing would be people who truly had faith. There is certainly more discussion to be had and I would still concede that baptism is crucial for anyone who wants to be obedient to God but I will move on.
2. Yasinksi also states that belief (and for the Catholic) baptism does not guarantee salvation, one must continually confess sin or risk losing his salvation. This is false. If you have truly put your faith in Christ as Lord of your life, you will receive the Holy Spirit ([Mark 1:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1%3A8&amp;version=CSB)). The Bible also tells us the Holy Spirit is a guarantee ([2 Corinthians 1: 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A20-22&amp;version=CSB), [Ephesians 1: 13-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A13-14&amp;version=CSB)) The Bible literally tells us it is a guarantee. Jesus also said that no one can pluck believers from the Father's hand ([John 10: 27-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+10%3A27-30&amp;version=CSB)) With this claim comes the responsibility of answering why some ""Christians"" fall away from the faith. The Bible also gives an explanation for this as well. Read [1 John 2: 18-23](https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/1-john/passage/?q=1-john+2:18-23). In this passage when John says ""anti-christs"" in the plural he literally means simply anyone who rejects or opposes Christ. He is not calling them Satan or the final Anti-Christ in the singular. Certainly we should confess our sin, especially to God, but confessing sin to others regularly does not save us.
3. Yasinski states that salvation includes obedience to what God has commanded of us. While we certainly should obey God's commands, this does not save us. This should be clear by this point from some of the passages I've already linked. ([Ephesians 2: 8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A8-9&amp;version=CSB), [Romans 10: 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9&amp;version=CSB), [John 3: 15](https://www.biblestudytools.com/csb/john/3-15.html)) One problem that some might raise up is the Book of James, which often discusses good works. I would merely tell you that if you read [James 2: 18-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A18-20&amp;version=CSB) you will understand James is still concerned with faith. However, true faith will bring about good works. These works serve as evidence of faith inside of us. The one without true faith will not have works that persist throughout their entire life. Therefore James is arguing that his works demonstrate the faith he already has. A christian who understands the Bible correctly would surmise that good works are not a part of salvation but instead a part of what is called sanctification, the process of being made more like Christ. This may not seem like a big deal but it actually is a massive difference. 

In conclusion anyone who would teach that salvation involves anything other than only true saving faith in Christ as Lord over their life is not a Christian. That is one of the core foundational beliefs in the religion. This does not even touch on all the other beliefs that would differentiate Catholicism from the denominations such as Baptists and Protestants. I have neglected to discuss things such as prayer to saints, the pope and his stance on things such as homosexuality which the Bible clearly forbids, transubstantiation, their refusal to biblically handle leaders who have been accused and some proven to have sexually assaulted children, and their deep and dark history of taken advantage of the poor and illiterate for profit for hundreds of years. 

Here are some other links to better arguments for why Catholicism is not true Christianity than I presented.

Finally for the catholic who might say ""no we would never teach something like this"" here is a list of anathema statements from the Council of Trent. (An anathema simply means to be accursed or damned to Hell)

 ""If anyone says that by faith alone the impious are justified (that nothing else is required to obtain justification and that it is not necessary to use one's own will), let him be anathema.""

 ""If anyone says that a man born again and justified is bound to believe that he is one of the predestined, let him be anathema.""

"" If anyone says that he will persevere unto the end, unless he learned this by special revelation, let him be anathema ""

"" If anyone says that by the Catholic doctrine of justification, by this synod set forth in this present decree, the glory of God or the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ are derogated from, let him be anathema.""

Tl:;dr: Catholicism is too different from the rest of Christianity on the Gospel, and they even pronounced damnation on anyone who teaches people are saved by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone. They should never be lumped together with Christianity.",0,1585577882,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frrlng/the_catholic_church_is_not_and_should_not_be/,unpopularopinion,1

frrjey,GrabEmbytheMAGA,The blame being pinned on the federal government and President Trump is misplaced,"The United States is not based around a CENTRALIZED government

It is a REPUBLIC of 50 states all broken down into their own little counties/parishes/boroughs.

To be exact: *There are* **3,242** *counties and county-equivalent administrative units in total, including the District of Columbia and 100 county-equivalents in the U.S. territories.* 

[wiki source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_statistics_of_the_United_States)

Hospitals stay understaffed and overworked. This has been common practice since before the Corona Virus. Ask any nurse or doctor or even go ahead and look up all the articles written about it. 

These hospitals are also the ones that are currently not prepared for a pandemic, epidemic, whateverdemic to this scale. Whatever regulating forces are in place for this need to be assessed in hindsight. However, this goes back to our state and local governments; it was and is on them to make sure that THEIR population can be properly taken care of. They are the ones that need the most scrutinizing. 

Every Senator and Congressperson had the same amount of information that the President had with anything related to this coronavirus and the threat it potentially was. They had all the time to prepare their states for this. However, they are passing blame. The areas being hit the hardest are those of dense populations and those are usually cities of which Democrats usually run. They are the ones that weren't prepared to keep their citizens healthy and have readily available resources for this outbreak. 

VP Mike Pence and his team have been given the task of herding cats.

frrfhp,sterlinii,Sexual assault is more of a mens issue than womens.," *(Update: Retitled)*

Despite what you may have heard in your life, there are still more male rapists due to higher rates of male on male rape compared to female on female rape. This I agree with, **however** neither stat is very high in absolute terms. Contrary to what you've probably heard in the past, most men are not raped by other men. **80% are raped by women (sources below).** More men in total are raped every year than women, making sexual assault more of a men's issue than a women's issue.

Several decades ago in fact, there was an early gender studies ""researcher"" named Mary Koss proposed that a person **""forced to penetrate""** was declared to another person that it is not in fact rape. She called it unwanted sexual contact and Mary Kross was VERY successful in convincing academics and even lawmakers to adopt this definition.While technically it is gender neutral, due to the anatomical differences between men and women, it mainly applied to men. Her rationale was that men must ""want it"" or are ""asking for it"" so it doesn't count.

As a result of this, the actual true rate of sexual assault against men is usually hidden in official statistics. **Instead of rape, they call it ""made to penetrate""**. In fact, many state and national laws around the world similarly define rape in gendered terms, meaning female rapists avoid prosecution and generally don't get discussed in the media. This has led to decades of misinformation on the topic. And it has only just recently started getting attention, both on the legal front, and among academics.

frratm,eyetwitch_24_7,Wine is just disgusting.,"I've tried, for a long time, to like wine. I love the way people talk about it and all its complexity and different ""notes."" But, damn, it tastes disgusting. Sure, there's a hint of nuttiness or fruitiness, but it's a small hint hidden in a giant bucket of ball sweat. 

One day I was out with a real wine aficionado who was dutifully trying to enlighten me. We were drinking very expensive bottles, that I was not—even the tiniest bit—appreciating. She started listing off the wine descriptors. Things like ""oaky"" and ""earthy."" But then she got around to ""wet gravel"" and ""cat urine"" and my mind did one of those record-scratch things. I said, ""wait, what? Come again, now."" She said ""cat urine"" was a valid descriptor of a wine's taste...and not in a bad way. Not like ""ooooh, this tastes like cat urine, I guess it was stored incorrectly."" I fuckin' looked it up because I thought she was making that shit up...she wasn't.  

Well, that pretty much did it for me. I'm out. All these years and I'm thinking ""why do I still think this stuff tastes like cat piss?"" Turns out, it's because it often does.  

Now, granted, they say some people just have the wrong kinds of tastebuds to truly enjoy wine. I may be one of those people and others are just experiencing it totally differently. But I have deep suspicions that maybe people all taste it the way I do and they just really like the wine culture and  talking at length about the complexity of what it is their drinking, regardless of how pleasurable it is to actually drink it.",10,1585576807,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frratm/wine_is_just_disgusting/,unpopularopinion,1

frr8lg,SkynetEngineer,"As long as religious services continue, social distancing concept is useless.","I live in a very conservative part of the country, unfortunately a place that has had a fast increase number of infections.

Our county has been going out of the way to try to ""pretend"" to do something to slow down infections, there is a stay-at-home order, non-essential businesses are being fined when they are open, some of the main streets even have road barriers so you have to go through a small checkpoint .

But there is one big problem, and that is that religious services are still being allowed to continue unrestricted, and this is helping the virus spread rapidly in my area.

Local people are concerned, but our state politicians continue to make exceptions or just look the other way.

We have been very good in our neighborhood at social distancing, public parks and pools have been closed, but then yesterday I saw several of my neighbors get in their cars with their families (Some who are high risk) and then go to church. I was kind of surprised that this was still being allowed, but after doing further research, it looks like most (if not all) of the religious services are open.

Asking for everyone else and everything else to practice social distancing, while allowing for religious services to continue, kind of defeats the purpose of social distancing.",11,1585576577,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frr8lg/as_long_as_religious_services_continue_social/,unpopularopinion,1

frr8jq,EnslavedByKittens,"People that eat meat, but are crying and blaming China for the Coronoavirus outbreak are hypocrits.","This isn't just a Chinese issue, how quickly most of you seem to have forgotten the swine flu from just a few years ago - which has been traced back to farms in the US.

Fact of the matter is, farming systems across the globe accelerate the chances of these viruses forming and increase the chances they're able to mutate and have an ability to jump host to humans. Whereby it's incredibly easy for these viruses to spread, if I recall correctly a study by John Hopkins University stated that 1 gram of chicken poo can contain 10 billion viruses. So even the ""cleanest"" farms, are potential vectors for an outbreak.

It's only a matter of time because a bird flu, that is highly virulent, but less infectious, is able to gene swap with another strain like H1N1 inside an immunocompromised host like a pig, where it has the potential to create something that is not only incredibly virulent but also highly infectious.

The Guardian had a good article on it yesterday, people need to wake up. You can point fingers at China all you want, but the next pandemic can easily come from any farm here in the West.

You might not realize it because you've become so used to it that you don't notice them any more. Constantly focusing on the negative aspects of humans and the world doesn't somehow make you ""enlightened""; it means either you've chosen to ignore the amazing things in the world, you're depressed (understandable), or you're just pretentious thinking hating everything makes you somehow better.

If you insist on things being constantly cleaned and straightened,  then that falls on you.  You shouldn't be complaining about it while you do it either.  It's not your partner / roommate's fault that you feel so strongly about it.   If they are doing their part to maintain a normal level of cleanliness in the residence,  then leave them alone.  All you are doing is creating a stressful living situation for both of you.  It's stressful for you because your expectations of others are too high and begging for disappointment.

And I’m shocked that more people don’t grasp the immediate connection between romantic rejections without any explanation and popular gateways to alt-right movements that claim to give answers to why someone is getting constantly rejected. Is it any wonder why that stuff gained traction?

It does help to have someone pointing out blind spots—heck that’s what interview prep companies and tutors do!

Yeah because this literally hasn't happened since probably the Spanish flu almost 100 years ago, and is pretty unprecedented or at least unanticipated at a global scale, but they *somehow* should have had well-practiced contingency plans and emergency funds in place for *something just like this*.

**Just like how you all already had plenty of dry food and toilet paper** *BEFORE* hearing about your region's shelter in place executive orders. /s

But I digress: those companies should be bailed out because **we work for them.** And when this is over, we'd probably all like jobs right?

I will say, this is probably a spectrum of companies who will actually need bail outs. On one end of the spectrum, some CEOs are taking pay cuts of their salaries in order to keep their employees paid. If that's working, they don't need a bailout. If the CEO took the cut themselves and still can't keep everything running, depending on their sector, they might maybe should be bailed out possibly. Because we need an economy. Because jobs. Because while I look forward to my COVID check, I look forward more to having an actual living.

I'm far from an economist, or anyone at the top of any company who will benefit to say this. I got laid off due to COVID too, even after getting set up to work from home. I eagerly await my COVID check, and I will be grateful to get it.

frr0p3,Catch_0x16,'Strong independent Beyonce' music does more harm than good.,"30, male here.

I am now aware of a handful of divorces (including my own) within my extended friend group that would not have happened in previous generations.

My mother (70+) made a point recently that has stuck with me for a while and I wanted to raise it to Reddit. To paraphrase: 
My dad cheated on her many years ago, they were going through financial difficulties, stress was at maximum. She was hurt and angry about it, but they worked through it. 'Men are vain idiots who need validation' as she put it. They stayed together, are still together now and have been great parents. They've had their difficulties but worked through them. They didn't give up on each other. In her words this was 'common' and to do anything else was seen as questionably selfish.

The point she made was that many modern women seem to think it is 'strong and independent' of them to hit the abort button and enforce strict boundaries. (She attributes it to the effect of music and idolatry of the 'strong woman' celebrity types. She dislikes Beyonce for this reason...though she's 70 so I doubt she's in the target audience anyway.). Neither of us are/were suggesting that infidelity is acceptable, just that giving up is worse.

I assert that this 'strong' attitude is in fact weakness. I assert this as I believe it shows a lack of empathy (to try and work out objectively, what went wrong), Commitment &amp; Dedication (to acknowledge the problems and seek out a solution and repair them). And instead prioritises selfishness (focussing only on the hurt attributed to oneself, and disregarding the effect on others e.g. children, when calculating a response). 

I believe that the message driven hard by these celebrity types is one of selfishness, not strength. And it is a simple message to understand and implement, hence it's popularity (it takes a lot less effort to focus only on one's self). There would be more happy and trustful marriages today if both parties were not being encouraged to be 'strong and independent'.

Obviously, none of what I have said applies to abusive relationships, that's very different as I'm sure we all agree.",0,1585575772,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frr0p3/strong_independent_beyonce_music_does_more_harm/,unpopularopinion,1

Well, I have news for you guys, that shit was written all over the walls since season fucking 1. The quarantine has me rewatching the show, and truthfully, once you know the end, Dany's actions all add up. Hell, the S2 finale shows her having a vision in a burned down Kings Landing and throne room full of ashes.

Side characters and main characters explicitly state multiple times throughout the first 2 seasons that ""dragons will burn everything down"". Dany screams multiple times that she will kill everyone that wrongs her. 

Her descent into the mad queen started as early as season 1, but the people that want to hate on season 8 are just too blinded by hatred to rewatch the series and realize they were tricked by her lies to all of the characters about being different than her father. People that loved the character too much refused to see the writing on the walls and then blamed the full turn on bad writing when that isn't the case.

Police are nowhere to be seen, speed limits don’t exist anymore and everything happening outside is mostly blackmarket/underground.

CHINA IS FREAKING LYING ABOUT THEIR NUMBERS. *Shocked Pikachu*

Keep in mind that country by population is first, China, second India, and third the US. COVID-19 is insanely contagious. In the long run, the number of cases will directly correlate to population. People just need to slow the spread.

Stop spreading Anti American propaganda. You’re just doing what China wants to you. They’re trying to spin this whole scenario into one that makes them a world super power, but don’t forget that they killed countless people in attempts to cover up this disease, which left the rest of the world less prepared and they very well may have invented this disease in experimenting with biological warfare. 

Also, to those bashing America that live there, WHY DONT YOU LEAVE?! Oh yeah, it’s because YOUR LIFE IS DAMN AWESOME THERE!

So knock it off, it’s China you should be bashing, not America. No country was ready for something like this, even the country that arguably was the most prepared, South Korea took a significant hit as well.

Stop being China’s bitch.

She uses the same pattern of manipulation and emotional guilt trip with everyone, and as a result everyone ends up feeling the same way about her. Toxic people only cause harm to those around them and use specific methods to keep people to be their friends. But it became a trend to say that for example your ex was a narcissist because he was jealous. Some people are more possessive than others because they may have trust issues, but if there’s no threats or emotional guilt trip it’s not toxic, it’s a personality trait and doesn’t make them control freak toxic narcissists. NPD is a mental illness that needs a diagnosis btw, and even if someone abuses you it doesn’t mean they’re a narcissist.

People also say to cut out the toxic negative fake friends out of your life, but toxic negativity is constantly putting you down when you’re happy and discouraging you in your projects. If a friend isn’t necessarily as enthusiastic as you about things, it’s how they are and it doesn’t make them toxic. You can ditch them without going after everyone saying how you used to have such a toxic friendship with them. I know it sounds oddly specify but I genuinely hear this regularly from people who describe things that aren’t toxic or abusive at all, and it’s nearly disrespectful for those who received abuse or were in a toxic relationship before.

frqqft,Jedwa3658,I actually don’t really mind Leia using the Force to pull herself back to the ship in The Last Jedi.,"First of all, I really didn’t like The Last Jedi. So I’m not going to defend the movie as a whole. But I think it’s odd that people fixate on the scene where Leia pulls herself back into her ship using the Force as an example of why the film is so bad.

We’ve seen Star Wars movies introduce new Force powers all the time. Force ghosts are introduced in Empire (or A New Hope if you count Obi Wan’s voice). Vader deflecting blaster fire with his hands was first seen in Empire. Force lighting was introduced in Return of the Jedi. Force speed in Phantom Menace, and so on. So the argument of “since when can you use the Force to do that?” doesn’t really make sense to me, since we see people do new things with the Force all the time in the films.

If the issue is with the visuals rather than the concept, I didn’t really mind how the scene looked. She was in space trying to get back to safety as quickly as possible. It makes sense that her body would move in a straight line back to the ship.

The Last Jedi was not a good Star Wars movie, and in my opinion, is the reason the new trilogy fell apart completely. But of all the terrible things in that movie, I don’t think the ultra Force-sensitive Leia using the Force to save herself was an issue worth getting worked up about.",5,1585574695,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frqqft/i_actually_dont_really_mind_leia_using_the_force/,unpopularopinion,1
frqqef,rhetorical_twix,"I don't want to hear from Amazon workers who don't want to work w/CV risks and walk out to shut down distribution centers. They can take leave without pay &amp; their jobs will still be waiting for them afterward, unlike other essential workers who quit to avoid exposure risks","**Walkout**

Amazon workers in Staten Island, NY are staging a walkout because they think the facility should close after a worker there was diagnosed with COVID-19. 

**Essential Workers**

Amazon workers hold essential jobs just as people who work in general goods stores like Walmart, Target and in grocery stores, and everyone else who is working who is part of a distribution and supply chain. Amazon jobs expose them to less risk of coronavirus exposure as they aren't interacting with the general public, like store front employees, police, postal workers who take mail from the public, and most others. 

**PPE and sanitizer supplies**

Amazon has a certain amount of industrial sanitizer supply that it can provide workers. It can't break public health priorities and supply its workers with masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment that health care professionals working with sick patients need. Like any other essential worker, Amazon workers have to obtain, make or buy them for themselves (which they are allowed to do).

**Benefits**

Some Amazon employees with their jobs being thrust in the ""essential"" category, don't want to face coronavirus risks. They feel that facilities should be shut down as risks mount. Amazon allows employees without a COVID-19 self-isolation need or diagnosis to take unpaid leave for an indefinite amount of time. Other workers, part time or full time, can get 2 weeks paid leave for COVID-19 related self-isolation. Most other essential workers aren't getting these benefits. Amazon workers don't have to shut down the Staten Island facility if they don't want to continue to work there during the coronavirus outbreak -- they can opt for unpaid leave and allow temporary workers to take their place.  Amazon has been hiring large numbers of temporary workers for this reason. Unlike a lot of other companies, Amazon offers health care benefits to part-time workers, so there's no reason why even part time workers don't have health care. 

**Just Stay Home**

No one is going to buy PPE for you, like surgical masks, N95 masks and gloves while health care providers are struggling to protect themselves due to limited supplies. If you want them, buy some yourself on aliexpress where they're below market price. Or make your own DIY masks. Amazon workers who have found themselves in an ""essential"" job and aren't happy about it can stay home and take unpaid leave, and their jobs should be waiting for them after coronavirus has passed. Most other essential workers don't have that option. If you want to stay home, just stay home instead of trying to shut down the facilities for an essential distributor of needed goods. No one is forcing you to work. 

**Lots of Red Herrings**

When you actually push someone to explain why their complaints are unrealistic, they end up wandering into territory full of ""red herring"" arguments, where they argue that if Amazon did this certain procedure or organized this other kind of workflow, it would reduce risks somewhat. Well look, all essential food growers/makers, distributors and deliverers are facing massive challenges right now, like how to actually get stuff from changing supply chains so that there are things for people to eat and take care of themselves with. If the company should take measures to switch to untested work flows and business processes to redesign your warehouse or shopper or delivery experience to make you 5% safer, maybe you can enjoy living in an ideal world while elderly people with limited options starve in isolation.

Anyways, to make a long opinion short (too late, I know), I don't want to hear about your issues anymore because I think they are the complaints of people who are not willing to step up to having an essential job right now. That's your real problem. So admit it and take leave without pay and stop grandstanding",9,1585574689,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frqqef/i_dont_want_to_hear_from_amazon_workers_who_dont/,unpopularopinion,1

To give some context: I’m normally build and have a normal weight for my height, I wash myself twice a day and use deodorant frequently. When I wear an average 10€ tshirt from H&amp;M I can wear it 2-3 days before it starts smelling. When I wear your average 40€ patagonia tshirt it takes half a day before the tshirts starts to smell badly and before I get sweaty armpits the size of the Mediterranean.

frpxl9,sterlinii,Sexual assault for men have almost equal rates to that of women.,"There are still more male rapists due to higher rates of male-on-male rape compared to female-on-female rape, but neither stat is very high in absolute terms. Contrary to what you've probably heard in the past, most men are not raped by other men. \~80% are raped by women. More men in total are raped every year than women, making sexual assault more of a men's issue than a women's issue.

Several decades ago, an early gender studies ""researcher"" named Mary Koss proposed that a person ""forced to penetrate"" another person is not in fact raped. She called it unwanted sexual contact and she was very successful in convincing academics and even lawmakers to adopt this definition. While technically it is gender neutral, due to the anatomical differences between men and women, it mainly applied to men. Her rationale was that men must ""want it"" or are ""asking for it"" so it doesn't count.

As a result, the true rate of sexual assault against men is usually hidden in official statistics. Instead of rape, they call it ""made to penetrate"". And many state and national laws around the world similarly define rape in gendered terms, meaning female rapists avoid prosecution and generally don't get discussed in the media. This has led to decades of misinformation on the topic. And it has only just recently started getting attention, both on the legal front, and among academics.

We also talk of grocery workers and give them praises and encouragements. This is more pronounced in the mainstream and social medias. 

But how abot those in the financial sectors? The bankers who constantly have to be in banks so those hospitals and other essential sectors of the economy can deposit/withdraw cash to compensate the nurses, the doctors, the polices and all those good people their salaries and hazard pay? The people who provide service for citizens who need money to buy goods and services so they can still eat and entertain themselves as they endure the daily troubles of being stuck at home?

Sure they don't get to treat people, provide groceries for us to buy, or maintain order during times of crises, but aren't they also needed for whatever's left of the crippled economy to function? Do they not also brave the daily fears of being infected because they couldn't be at home safe and quarantined? 

With clients coming in and out, who knows where the cash they have to handle have come from. Not withstanding the fact that they risk being infected should walk-in clients are unknowingly infected themselves.

froyx8,CherryPickingPolice,It doesn’t matter if you can tell whether or not an account is a Russian bot,"If they’re acting like it, the motive doesn’t matter, the consequences are all the same.

I wish Reddit would take this to heart more when I see the same accounts being upvoted to the front page and if you go through their post history it’s nothing short of insanity, one way or the other. Anyone that eats, sleeps and breathes politics to such an extent that every waking hour is spent attacking one political party or the other and not one comment or post deviates from politics is not someone to be taken seriously.

If they’re polarizing, damaging, and dehumanizing in their approach to politics it doesn’t matter whether it’s ordered by Russia or of their own agency, it’s all the same in its divisiveness.

Especially be weary of:

Nicknames. Never referring to a political party or person without a demeaning prefix or suffix. Propaganda 101.

Accusations of wrongdoing if you disagree. Being called anti-American, or claims of putting foreigners above your own people.

False dichotomies. If you agree with so-and-so, you must also have this opinion. You’re complicit with everything their party does, or you’re endorsing every action of an individual.

ESPECIALLY look-out for those that don’t advocate for a platform themselves. That is the biggest indicator someone is liking to stir up trouble more than anything else.

I’m from CT and first of all, without the virus situation. Fuck New York. They drive like shit and their dickheads in person for no reason. I’ve been in 2 accidents in my whole life (including when I was a kid) and both times it was a guy from New York who got out and started screaming even though it was their fault both times. Also the people who own houses outside of New York are the rich pricks who are just infinitely worse. They come up to the “countryside” where I live to get out into nature and then get pissed when I can’t tell them where the trails are because there aren’t any trails, it’s a state forest not Central Park.

Now with the virus these rich assholes go to parties and shit in New York, catch the virus and spread it around their shithole then they see all the people they infected and decide to run away to my state and Rhode Island and spread it around here. Then governor dickface gets up there and says he’s gonna sue Rhode Island for doing what they damn well should be doing. If New Yorkers are going to be irresponsible then stay irresponsible in New York. Let us live our lives without you dicks causing problems. I went for a walk with my dog yesterday just up my street and I was stopped by 2 cars with New York plates asking how to find the hiking trails. (Keep in mind my street has a house about every half mile and is mostly forest so there’s nobody walking on the street except for me) if you’re going to come to my town the least you could do is stay inside and stop causing problems for all of us. 

Also with all the freaks panic buying the grocery stores are getting raided as it is, now these guys come in and need to stock up their summer homes so they’re buying even more stuff, yesterday I went to go buy food and there was this guy cursing out an employee because he couldn’t find some Clorox for his summer house.

frool9,euan-crabtree,"Maths isn't hard, it's just cool to hate it.","I know plenty of people who tell everyone at any opportunity how awful they are at maths, or how they ""just don't get it"". They will proudly boast about how they couldn't ""remember the formulas"" in their exam, or they will have a collective group moan about how graph theory will never help them in life and math classes should be about filling out a tax form instead. It's like people compete over how much they can suck at it instead of how good they are at it.

In reality, maths is really easy. It's just logic. You can follow the same process to understand literally anything you want in maths - just take the thing and iteratively rewrite it until you get to something that you already know. The only things you actually have to memorize are the very few self-evident facts, and you can derive literally anything else in maths from there. Sure, there's some notation that you have to learn as you go, but people still come across words in English that they don't understand every day and they don't panic - they just figure out the meaning from the surrounding context. The only way to be truly bad at math is to lack any sort of logical derivation skills - if that was the case, you wouldn't be able to cook your own food or do any kind of job.

Most people who think they hate maths have actually just never tried it. People are taught to memorize arithmetic and geometry facts rather than learn to derive them from things that they already know. I'm sure everyone knows pythagoras' theorem, but how many people truly understand where it comes from? The few teachers who try to explain things properly are fighting a losing battle against parents, who were themselves taught by rote learning and refuse to accept that there is a better way. This creates a culture of people thinking that maths is just memorizing a bunch of meaningless facts, rather than exploring a whole new universe that exists inside your head.

The problem is that when you try to learn maths by memorization, you're fighting against exponential growth. If each fact that you memorize has a few further facts to derive directly from it, the total number of facts that you need to memorize will grow exponentially. We know from the current situation how that turns out.",40,1585565980,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frool9/maths_isnt_hard_its_just_cool_to_hate_it/,unpopularopinion,1

frofkp,trashgarbagebird,It’s more socially acceptable to insult an attractive person than an unattractive person,"The title basically. People that are attractive get hate that is often more vicious attacks in general than the kind unattractive people get due to it coming from a more sinister place ie: jealousy.

An unattractive person might be told about their unattractive trait, but usually it’s in a softer way, “Well, looks don’t matter you’re attractive on the inside”

An attractive person will attract jealousy, so people often jealously comments either on their attractive trait to make themselves feel better or search for their least attractive trait to attack eg: “you’re uh... eyes are weird and freak me out. Don’t ask why... they’re just weird” 

Attractive people are also kind of more “fair game” to to insult. They’re supposed to be better able to take it/deserve it more Eg: being slim is usually considered a better trait than being fat, so calling someone skinny stick or twig, is more socially acceptable than calling someone fat.

I noticed this because I was watching a blogger that is considered very attractive and he mentioned he “looks conceited if he acts too confident, but it works out well if you’re maybe a less attractive guy” this struck me as weird, then I noticed that what I consider to be the most attractive people I know never brag about their looks or broach the topic ever.",15,1585564718,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frofkp/its_more_socially_acceptable_to_insult_an/,unpopularopinion,1

froeik,JDweezy,The country of India absolutely disgusts me and I would never want to travel there.,"I recently watched a documentary about the economic divide in Mumbai, India and I am absolutely disgusted by the people in power there. The city skyline is littered with luxury skyscrapers the few rich people have built for themselves, that all overlook massive slums filled with millions of people living in the filthiest conditions known to man. 

Take billionaire Mukesh Ambani for example. He built himself a quaint little, 2 billion dollar sky scraper with 27 floors, 90% of which there is no way he could possibly use, which overlooks one of the largest slums in the world, where people live off piles of trash with human shit running through the streets and live in the same squalid factories that they work in because they cant afford to rent a small place for themselves. Could he seriously not have built, I dont know, a 100 million dollar house, which would still be pretty nice and used the remaining 1. 9 billion to bull doze at least some of these slums and help the people get some decent housing?

 Anyone that can live around that much of an economic divide without actually doing anything about it is a disgusting person, and I'm sick of this expectation where me, ""A rich westerner"" making $50k per year is supposed to help these people out by donating $20 per month. At least in most western countries a poor person has a decent shot at getting a decent job and living in somewhat clean, safe living conditions. 

I keep noticing that a lot of these poor countries that im supposed to be donating money to are some of the most resource rich places on earth and have no excuse for not being able to create a clean, functioning society where people can have clean water and not sleep in human feces.",39,1585564581,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/froeik/the_country_of_india_absolutely_disgusts_me_and_i/,unpopularopinion,1

As an article put it - 

“Although she is not the woman spectators buy tickets to watch, she is the kind of actress a director wants to direct, a screenwriter would choose to pronounce their words, and an actress that actors like as a co-star.
She is someone that producers would bet on for an impeccable performance because she might not be the first attraction to a movie, but every single one is better because she is in it.”

She’s is highly praised by critics and spectators every time, but she still doesn’t figure among the big ones of Hollywood. She’s been nominated for an Oscar 5 times, but has sadly not one.

Theyll learn about how to maintain their vehicle, properly because otherwise theyll never have fun. 

Theyll have to learn about stopping distances, handling, tyre grip, the limits of their ability and best of all theyll get a better control of their vehicles. Doesnt matter if youre no good but itll teach you a lot.

I know what youre thinking, a whole population of drivers wielding their fresh licenses, trying to be the next Lewis Hamilton on the way to get milk. That shouldnt be the case though.

 My Dad raced and my Uncle raced and they drive slower on the roads than the rest of my family, because they have been taught discipline and safety while racing. Their cars are also in the best condition as theyve had to be able to maintain their own vehicle or it meant no podium finishes when they were racing.

This has to be the solution to our modern, unaware driver.",8,1585562546,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fro0ea/mandatory_racing_as_part_of_getting_your_driving/,unpopularopinion,1
frnzgf,kayasphotographs,"Mental illness and adddiction aren’t fashionable, cool, personality traits","As someone who grew up with a severely mentally ill parent, it’s absolutely asinine that people today seem to think mental illness is fashionable and/or a personality trait. 

Growing up with someone who had narcissistic personality disorder, psychosis and drug addiction was hell. I witnessed my mother quickly fall apart, and lose herself rapidly, yet deteriorate gradually more and more, to the point where, she can’t even speak clearly anymore. 

I lost my mother, to mental illness and drug addiction. She’s still physically alive, don’t get me wrong, but her personality is gone. She was a loving, caring, intelligent woman, and now she’s erratic, nonsensical and can’t care for herself. 

She went from someone who worked a 9-5 job and had a college fund set up for me to being a homeless, cocaine addicted prostitute when I was 17, and me being taken away from her by the state due to her incompetence. 

I get genuinely angry when I hear some edgy teen say “Muh multiple personalities” or “Muh depression”. 

Mental illness and addiction aren’t fashionable. It’s life destroying and very serious. 

I don’t know how it became cool to be screwed in the head but it isn’t and it needs to stop being “cool”.

frnxg5,AnonymousProGamer,"Marvel movies are overrated, and DC movies are underrated.","Yes. The reason I think this is because of how popular the avengers became the last 2 years and how infinity war and endgame became blockbuster movies, hitting chartbuster records. I’ve watched both Marvel and DC movies, and I’ve come to acknowledge that DC movies are waaay better(IMO), it is because of how DC movies are directed. Tbh, you can’t watch infinity wars and endgame more than 2 times each, at the most. You can’t even watch any other marvel movie like Thor ragnarok, or spider man home coming, or any other movie, more than 4 times and think that it’s still enjoyable. 

On the other hand, you can watch DC movies like the dark knight and the dark knight rises more than 10 times each and still find it interesting. This is because DC movies are directed very well and the writers do a great job writing the scripts. Comparatively, marvel movies are directed moderately and the scripts are poorly written, I mean, you can’t laugh at the jokes, and the comedy is witty. I missed the Spider-Man franchise when Tobey and Andrew casted, I still don’t know why they were hated, their movies turned out to be a gem. 

I think DC movies have better quality and better screenplay, better story portrayal than marvel movies. 

I mean, thanos was not wrong tho. 

Batman was not wrong either. He’s not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need.

This is my opinion, and I know others might strongly disagree with me, but I feel that marvel is overrated and DC needs more recognition.",19,1585562120,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frnxg5/marvel_movies_are_overrated_and_dc_movies_are/,unpopularopinion,1

frnvy5,BadolatoJess,The pain of a (significant) break-up has the potential to be more severe than the pain of a death.,"Probably best to start with the caveat that trying to rank or compare levels of emotional pain is a bit facile, because it's all relative, but...

When a person dies, the sadness comes from a lost future, and the loss of the pleasure of that person, and also just a kind of vague and intangible sadness that we feel about death - perhaps it's fear of death and realisation of mortality masquerading as sadness.  You do however get the benefit of that person now being somewhat immortalised in a state of ideal memory. 

But when you go through a breakup - particularly one instigated by the other person, and even more particularly if that was on the back of some kind of duplicitous behavior - usually an affair... well, in that case you suffer the sadness of a lost future, and the loss of the pleasure of that person BUT you also lose all of your memories, because they become tainted with second guessing and doubt. 

There's a massive element of cognitive dissonance as you feel both extreme love and hate, and can't detangle the two. The confusion of these states can make you feel weak and useless, on top of the loss of sense-of-self that you're already experiencing because of the rejection, and because you now wonder why they don't love you anymore, and what is wrong with you. 

And then you're also filled with the complexity of hope - death is final and we're quite good about recognising that - but drawing a line under a relationship, even one that you've come to recognise as toxic or substandard, is a very difficult thing to do and false hope and the technical possibility of reconnection (however unlikely) leads to constant setbacks in emotional recovery. 

This is not really to take away from the pain of death - it's immense, but we tend to have a particular kind of sympathy for bereavement and a certain 'OK, you can be sad for a bit but it's time to get on with it now' attitude to divorce and big breakups. Which I think is kind of funny, since the pain associated with break ups tends to be full of more complex elements",9,1585561896,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frnvy5/the_pain_of_a_significant_breakup_has_the/,unpopularopinion,1

Yet this is totally part of their job. You cannot save every single person. Because you (yes, you, dear reader) wouldn't want that either.

Every day we make decisions that harm humans. Every cent you spend on something that isn't absolutely necessary for survival could have been spent on fighting famine, disease or pollution. But we mostly live our own comfortable lives instead.

Every time you speed on the highway, or even go somewhere when it's not absolutely necessary, you cause pollution contributing to the deaths of 8.4 MILLION people every year. (source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_pollution-related\_diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_pollution-related_diseases))

The decision to be able to go say 120 km/h on the highway instead of 110 km/h (or the equivalent in freedom units) absolutely costs lives, not just in terms of pollution but also in accidents.

More so, if any government in the world would start taxing at say 80% just to be able to provide everyone of health care immediately as it became necessary and treat everyone to the maximum possible extent, there would be massive protests. People do not want to go back to living in tiny houses without hobbies, travel or luxuries just to be able to save as many fellow citizens as possible.",5,1585561208,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frnrjb/human_lives_absolutely_have_a_financial_value/,unpopularopinion,1

frnmct,WoodlandSquirrels,Hero worship is a garbage cultural element that acts as a diversion and is harmful,"Whether it is in the states or the UK or elsewhere in the world, now during this global pandemic we are seeing a lot of headlines and talk of ""hero doctors"" and ""hero nurses"" etc. DYING while doing nothing but their JOBS because of the lack of action, preparation and decision making or straight up malicious corruption on the behalf of the people in power, as well as due to the apathy and inconsideration of their fellow citizens that do not heed the calls for social distancing, isolation etc. Of course not all deaths in these extraordinary circumstances can be avoided, but in many ""first world"" countries not even the first steps are being taken.

While the conviction of these individuals is admirable and the self sacrifice they make for others is great, this hero talk just distracts from what people actually should be doing and fetishizes death in a similar way that the fascist regimes of the past have fetishizes the ""heroic death"" of their soldiers in order to drive both young and old men to their deaths over and over. While you can view the self sacrifice of these healthcare workers as heroic, stop focusing on it to such an extent that you forget they are VICTIMS, just the same as other people. And if you actually care about them being heroes, dont sit with your thumb up your ass making reddit comments about how you feel sorry for their family, how they were a great person, or how this situation is fucked up and your particular government is dropping the ball.

Your spouse is most certainly aware that you are married. 
Marriage is a legal contract and in that contract should be a clause outlawing cheating by default, of cause it is your marriage and you could elect to remove it, but i think it would give a good indication of your partners character should they wish it was removed. Cheating causes unnecessary mental, emotional and often financial harm (especially if it leads to divorce) to an innocent party. Cheaters deserve to have a big black spot on their record it is a very clear indication of character for those around them.

Yes, undoubtedly there are some really underpaid jobs like a CNA for the crap they deal with....but the majority are not at all like that.

Teacher - $40k-$100k over the course of their career and state (don't believe 100k? Go look up the salary for a teacher with a masters and 20 years experience in any northern state). Oh, and they get to make another 20k on top of it from tutoring or teaching summer school during the summer.

Law Enforcement/Firefighters/Military - $35k-$250k. I was really surprised to find out how much cops and firemen actually make. Sure the brand new ones only get like 35k, but there are SO MANY that make over 100k with a pension at the end just for being a random sergeant in some big city or wealthy suburb department. The experienced captains and chiefs of large cities are hitting 200k easily counting their benefits. Oh, and most of them have gigantic amounts of 1.5x overtime available to literally double or triple their salary if they really want to. Career military, if you stay for 20 years and are even slightly competent you make 70kish enlisted and 150kish officer side counting benefits. Generals make over 200k.

Politicians - every member of congress makes 174k, case closed.

Random government employees - all the cogs in the wheel of random agencies nobody has ever heard of, still eventually make like 60k-80k with benefits and a pension.

frn69h,rubros34,Extra curricular activities should not play a huge role in college admissions,"I know this one is really unpopular. I strongly believe playing sports, instruments, or knowing how to fix something should not affect your college admissions. Think about it. It takes money and time to do all those things. American students sleep late bc of clubs and activities, leading them to stay up to do homework, not to mention that America gives more hw than Korean and Finland, the two countries with the best education systems. Honestly, think about it. Will you use your violin skills if you are an engineer? Just think about it. I hate how colleges want you to be well-rounded and talented. 

Colleges say you need experience working as a volunteer, but as long as our contributions are amateur level, it is not gonna make a difference. We are high schoolers. We are minors. Of course we cant do anything. I just hate that colleges try to expect us to change the world, when really, we already have bigger organizations doing that. If you think we children can change the world, the you should let us go to clubs at like 6th grade and let us drive starting from middle school or something. The point is that since that is preposterous, the expectation that we can change the world is also preposterous. 

However, I think colleges should accept any activies that have something to do with your major. Like if you're going to be a history major, colleges should not weigh in the fact that you play the cello or sing well. Instead, they should recognize history related activities. Just imagine that the reason why you got rejected from school was because you never picked up a ball and kicked around with it.",33,1585557906,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frn69h/extra_curricular_activities_should_not_play_a/,unpopularopinion,1

frn3zg,JCEg,Risking lives to protect the elderly and infirm.,"So this is my opinion...I’ve worked in care of the elderly in different settings for a long time. I’ve seen most of the ailments, pain, frustration, of what living to a fair old age brings and it’s not the nicest and wouldn’t wish it on anyone. If I had a dollar for the number of times an elderly person has said to me ‘don’t get old will you?!’ I probably wouldn’t have to go to work. But here I am a mum of two along with other carers who have young families or who are close to retiring, still risking their lives in the current circumstances to make sure that Florence (who doesn’t know who she is, what she is, is confined to bed and has to be fed and changed) is still alive. Unfortunately most of the time they are affected by some sort of dementia which greatly impacts on them. Some are aggressive and extremely nasty to us. Some, like I’ve said, do not even know who they are anymore but we still have a duty of care to prolong their extremely poor quality of life. My point is that I don’t actually blame the carers that were working in a Spanish old people’s home for just leaving the residents there. The carers have the rest of their lives to live and were obviously very scared and worried they would catch corona and/or take it to their families. Many people have said how awful it was of them to just leave them there but I can understand why they did. If I was a resident in a home and still had a bit of understanding left and I knew the situation, I would tell them to go and save themselves and not to put their lives in danger for someone who is very old, frail, and has little to no quality of life left anyway.",3,1585557534,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frn3zg/risking_lives_to_protect_the_elderly_and_infirm/,unpopularopinion,1

Suppose I have $1400. Why would I buy a Dell XPS 13 and not a Precision 3541? The latter is way more powerful, is built like a tank, respects millitary standards (MIL-STD-810G), and is the laptop I can count on if I want to keep it for at least 5-6 years. It's even more upgradable - I can swap out the RAM, Wi-Fi card and I believe it has a slot for a second SSD.

 I switched from a Lenovo Yoga ultrabook to a gaming laptop and I'm way happier to be honest. Ironically, my gaming laptop now has double the battery life, while also having a decent graphics card and more ports (including an USB-C port). My laptop to be honest does have some structural issues, but they're nowhere near as profound as my poor Lenovo laptop - that one died in one year and a half due to its poor hinge mechanics.

Also, my father bought TEN years ago a bulky Acer laptop for $500 - it STILL boots up and somewhat works - all it really needs is its hard drive swapped out for an SSD. It went through my sister's hands, then I used it for 3 years, then gave it to my father. Not to mention all the 2005-06-07 laptops from the Windows XP era that still have juice in them.

Manufacturers can go screw themselves to be honest. Ultrabooks have more cons than pros in my opinion, the ultimate objective being planned obsolescence - thin laptops are far harder to repair than bulky workstations. Don't tell me 2.5-3 kg is too heavy for you.",3,1585555697,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frmsaj/thin_and_light_ultrabook_laptops_are_bullshit/,unpopularopinion,1

frmr2g,farplesey,Giving someone the death penalty is not the same as putting down a coyote,"I'm from a rural state where the death penalty is legal. People are largely farmers and ranchers who glorify it--to them it's like putting down a coyote or wolf that's been killing their livestock. Necessary. Except more than that, because animals are just doing what comes natural, but people should know better. Which, yes, is true. But the way they talk about it comes dangerously close to mob mentality. They hear what this person did and get up in arms about how he should be punished without ever bothering to ask whether he can be rehabilitated, whether there are other ways to ensure he never hurts people again, or even whether he did the thing at all. It's such a common idea; people bring it up casually in conversation, make little remarks about it. 

But it's not right.

We can always get it wrong. We condemn innocent lives. We end guilty lives before they have the opportunity to change. We assume we know better, that we know that this thing they are now is the thing they will always be, even as we bury our own regrets and previous selves in the ground so we don't have to look at them. We say that this is the only sure way to protect people, but there is a fine line between protecting the public and acting out of revenge and hatred. We admit that we stand close to that line, but will not admit on which side of the line we stand.

Basically I saw a post another female made on Facebook about how those who owe child support will not be getting the stimulus check (USA) in the next coming weeks.

 ""good. If your kid isn't eating than neither should you"". - taking a shot her son's father for not being around. 

 Okay. Fair enough. My issue here lies with how vocal this particular individual is about equal rights, abortion availability to all women, birth control for all women whenever they want it, women should have equal pay, vagina hats, all that jazz (Which I want to point out I am a female, and I agree) However I have come to realize that it's pretty universal, at leas in the US,  that if a woman is pregnant and chooses not to have the child, that's fine. If a man decides he doesn't want a child, or to be financially responsible of said child, that's not fine? I don't agree with the double standard and I don't think it's right. If people want to fight for ""equality"" than they need to be honest about what equal really is. BOTH sexes get to choose when it comes to reproduction, a woman can choose not to have a child, so can a man. A man should not be demonized, forcibly financially drained, threatened with court, jail time, or denied the benefit of a pandemic relief stimulus check because of their choice to not want a child.",11,1585552087,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frm4wc/if_women_can_abort_men_can_abandon/,unpopularopinion,1

frluki,R--U--B--Y,We’re all hypocrites until China is free.,"China is a communist country with a population over one billion. A communist country with the strongest propaganda complex since the Soviet Union, and they show no signs of weakening except for when it comes to the coronavirus. The point I’m getting to is that China has been essentially enslaved by the ccp. Do the Chinese people still have liberties? Sure, but they are severely limited. Limited to the extent that the Chinese people for the foreseeable future will never be truly free. Free of an oppressive sentry watching over their backs, making sure they say, do, and feel the right things. The things the party wants, not what they want. They can never be artists truly. They can never be open about their religion or their spiritual beliefs in general. When it all comes down to it, they are owned by the state. A state that will suppress their humanity. I know that Reddit is a very atheist minded community, I’m one as well, but I sincerely believe that everyone should have the right to house their own beliefs, spiritual or moral as long as they are not objectively wrong. Catholic, Muslim, Jewish it doesn’t matter you can believe what you want to believe as long as it gets you to be the best possible person you can possibly be. The Chinese communist party does not allow this. They will never allow this, and it will get worse. Think of what will happen while time goes on. The propaganda gets stronger year by year and it’s been made clear by the Nazis that any person no matter how intellectually sound can be convinced to believe a lie if that lie is told enough times. Generations of Chinese with nothing of the contrary shown to them could be systematically brainwashed by propaganda, into believing that the oppressed state they’re in is truly right, and truthful. Stability will not last and sooner or later there will be a collapse, but it won’t be pretty, not in the slightest. Japan wounded China in the twentieth century, deeply, but what Japan failed to do, the ccp has. They are attempting to and succeeding at scarring China, by pushing their people into giving up hope, and accepting that oppression and tyranny are truth. This, to me, is the biggest issue of the twenty first century, and I think that we are hypocrites to ignore it.",0,1585550554,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frluki/were_all_hypocrites_until_china_is_free/,unpopularopinion,1

There's a lot of things to hate about China's government. Censorship, Uyghur concentration camps, labor violations, general authoritarianism.

The difference between them and the U.S. though, is that China does not engage in incessant imperialism like the U.S. does.

The U.S. constantly puts down governments in South America, wages war in the Middle East, all in the name of ""democracy"", which is bullshit since many regime changes actually put far-right dictators in charge.

You can argue that China engages in imperialism, Tibet being a completely valid example, but it doesn't at the sheer scale the U.S. does. The U.S. has over 800 military bases all over the world. The World Bank and IMF that continually exploit Africa and keep it in poverty are based in the U.S.

And if you think this shit all happened in the 80s and the U.S. doesn't do that now, the U.S. just indicted Nicolas Maduro on bullshit narco-terrorism charges. It will never change as long as it's profitable.

European colonialism also never ended. Look up Thomas Sankara.

frlql2,themooninjune89,(Most) Women don't deserve the same rights as Men,"I think this is a truly unpopular opinion as I doubt it could be said publicly, sadly, but not for any particularly good reason. I used to hold the opposite opinion, but after spending extensive time on Reddit, any sub that is dominated by women is a place that provides massive amounts of empirical evidence that women have the mental capabilities of children on average. Any kind of basic critical thinking, logic, and even citation of standard facts, is considered ""incomprehensible"" and ""evil"" by women generally. Even the ""moderators"" of these communities literally respond to any challenges like children, with the literal insults of children.

Even worse, women appear to be absolutely incapable of empathy in any meaningful sense.

There is absolutely no way that (most) women should have equal rights to men given this overwhelming evidence that they are dangerous, mental children on average.

  
I will allow that there must be SOME outlier women who are better than their biology, and it seems like any such woman should be allowed to take a basic logic and reasoning test to gain the same rights as men. This needed be a particularly difficult test. A dozen questions could literally be of the form ""A BMI of 30 is considered clinically obese. Martin's BMI is 31. Is Martin clinically obese?"" In my experience, 99% of women can't accurately answer a question that basic. Letting the women who can answer such basic questions have basic rights, would be fine.

But the default rights shouldn't be available to women given how seriously mentally deficit they are. There is absolutely no way that society is improved by allowing women (in general) to have any kind of general say in a democracy.

Now, you might think that stupid men are also, well, obviously stupid, and it would be better to just have everyone pass these basic logic tests, but the evidence suggests otherwise. As stupid as males can be, they have a basic grasp of logic, and you aren't permabanned from male spaces for literally stating facts or using basic logic. There is a real, fundamental difference in general that exists. Allowing a huge population that are actually mentally incapable of basic logical thought to have a voice in society is actively dangerous. Frankly, I would imagine it makes women more miserable as well since we are essentially forcing people without the capacity to handle life's problems to deal with them.

I imagine things really were better, and both men and women must have been much happier before women were given so many rights in society.

Honestly, it frightens me that I held the opposite opinion for so long...seeing the actual reality of the situation by being able to actually experience it in large data terms has shattered my previous worldview. I don't know how anyone can use this site and not come to the same conclusion, though. Not being religious myself, I always figured tales of subservience of women were just religious nonsense...but after witnessing the reality firsthand, I am forced to admit ancient religious authors must have been on to something. Any society where men don't lead women is probably completely doomed. This is not a pleasure to know, either, it's not awesome, or cool. It's horrible. The implication is that if you're heterosexual you will likely never have a partner who is a mental equal to you...it's fucked up to think about. There is nothing pleasurable at all in this conclusion. But I don't see how the evidence can be denied.",0,1585549978,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frlql2/most_women_dont_deserve_the_same_rights_as_men/,unpopularopinion,1

frlgsf,AdamalIica,"People don't like going to the dentist not because they're ""scared"" of getting work done in their mouth, but because 90% of dentists are untrustworthy.","My wife went to a dentist after a long time of no dentist appointments. They did a routine cleaning, filled 8 of her cavities, and did a periodontal cleaning (deep cleaning) all within an hour. After looking it up, something seemed fishy.

I went to the same dentist and they gave me the same prognosis (eight cavities and needed deep cleaning). So, being the skeptical bastard I am, I said no thank you and left.

I went to a second dentist and after they did the regular cleaning, they said I had four cavities and also said I needed the same deep cleaning. The difference was, they could fill the cavities then, but I would need to schedule the periodontal cleaning for two different sessions - one on the right side, then one on the left side. The cavity filling was double the cost as my wife's dentist. I said I'd call them.

So of course I went to a third. That dentist refused doing a regular cleaning because they said my teeth were so bad that I needed four (four!) sessions of the periodontal cleaning (for each quadrant of the mouth). They also said I had four cavities (which cost more than both the previous dentists).

So, I haven't had any work done other than the second dentist's regular cleaning (but had to pay 400 bucks for the X-ray at the third dentist because my insurance only pays for two in a calendar year).

Which dentist do I trust? Are any of them trustworthy? Or are 90% of dentists out there trying to get as much money as they can from the patient or insurance company as they can?

frlfc5,carterpewtershit,Kristoff deserves better,"Frozen II has pretty much been playing on repeat in my household lately (spoiler alert), and I've been getting increasingly angry about how Kristoff is treated. Anna continually ignores and disrespects him, despite him treating her with utmost tenderness. 

Kristoff generously supports Anna in her journey (the second time I might add) and she barely gives him the time of day. An occasional peck on the cheek and ""love you honey"" is hardly the connection warranted to someone who is living with you and is risking his life for you and your sister. Later Anna proceeds to jump down his throat when he professes his love, then ditches him in the woods.

Now if you're thinking ""well he's lucky to be dating a princess"", let me remind you Kristoff is a self-made man, a hard-working ice entrepreneur, an orphan who overcame all odds and survived a grueling life. Meanwhile Anna hasn't done shit to earn her situation. She is lucky to have him, not the other way around. 

Kristoff is a considerate, brave, good-looking, well-built guy with great hair that could probably get any girl in Arendalle. Anna should grow up, butt out her sister's business, spend less time with her snowman friend, and start appreciating Kristoff's gestures and kindness.

Disney tried so hard to make these movies empowering to girls, but they went too far by trashing and marginalizing all the male characters. I would be disappointed in my two daughters if they followed Anna's approaches to relationships and treated men like that.

frleat,ember103,Sometimes attractive people have it worse,"Especially when they need sympathy. I've met a TON of bitter people who think that it's ok to be shitty to attractive women because they assume they have an easy life. I have a good friend who was always the source of envy from other girls, and as a result never had many friends.  Because she was shy, people assumed she was just a bitch. She had poor social skills because her family was incredibly abusive. Her older sister would taunt her and call her ""pretty but useless"" and she legit had the worst self- esteem of anyone i think i knew at the time. It was pretty sad. One girl in particular had a shitty boyfriend who pursued her which led to the entire group of girls making her life miserable until graduation. They would pick at everything- call her eyes shit-brown (they legit were so pretty), call her too skinny, too stupid (she didn't strike me as unintelligent, just socially anxious). She's doing really well now, but she still takes unnecessary shit from people pretty frequently. Despite being in her mid-twenties, she still has serious trust issues and difficulty connecting to other women. Guys obviously pursued her and some were legitimately nice, but plenty  of them were the source of abuse and harassment too. Lots of faux ""friends."" 

People seem to make less allowances for pretty women with low self-esteem and mental health issues, especially when it manifests as shyness.

frlc84,ScientistGalial,"Homeschool isn't that bad, please stop saying it is.","This is coming from a junior in highschool, 17 years old, who happens to be homeschooled. I have come to notice that over the time of being homeschooled that there is a lot of stigma and seemingly ignorance on the subject, it ranges from ""Oh your homeschooled? You must be super lonely and have no social skills!"" To being told that homeschool is worse then public school despite numerous articles and studies saying otherwise. It's quite annoying to have almost every person I tell tell me that i have no social skills or that I'm ""soft"" because when I tell them it was because I was being bullied back in 3rd grade when I was in public school. I understand that I might not know everything about public schools and that I might too be ignorant on certain aspects of homeschool for being in it for so long, but homeschooling isn't being isolated from everyone and just studying all day. Most if not all homeschools I been in have certain social programs hosted by the school or have on-site school classes depending on the type of subject it is so you still get some of the social aspects of public school. The major difference is that the class size is smaller (Were talking from 30/20 students to 10-15 at the most) and some of the other teens may have special needs (Not in any special ed classes.

  I'm mostly talking about things like ADHD, Aspergers, etc) and they are generally more compassionate and empathic to others situations because they have been bullied themselves or are understanding how it might be like to have a special need (My case I have ADHD). Besides, its techinally illegal anyway to isolate a child from social contact which at that point in most cases a homeschool would have to have social aspects to it. I rather be in homeschool and not get as much social interaction since I have to do less school work in the day, have a more flexible schedule for deadlines on homework (Generally you just stay on track and make sure your Suprieving teacher at the school has samples from your work) and have more free time in the day to get chores done, have a nice job to get money for my own things and have free time to my self. Like homeschool is negative in some aspects, sure, buts that mostly just in terms of somewhat less social interaction but at the cost of many more educational pros. Besides some schools have budgets of like 2000$ for the whole year per student to spend on school suppiles, classes for special interests (Aka more social interaction depending on the class) so that way parents don't have to come out of pocket most of the time.

Hell some homeschools I been in still have drama, like one school had this girl who faked several, extreme mental illnesses for the sake of attention to cover up the fact she had a sex tape on her phone from some guy in class, I only knew this was fake after her brothers told me it was. Like that's another advantage of Homeschooling, Less drama.

I'm just tired of constantly hearing I have no social skills or that my life must suck because im being homeschooled",21,1585547960,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frlc84/homeschool_isnt_that_bad_please_stop_saying_it_is/,unpopularopinion,1

frl9i7,NancTootsie,"If you can't afford a child, even if you can afford birth control, you shouldn't be having sex.","This is in response to another thread here.

Honestly if you're in the kind of place where you can't deal with having a child, then you shouldn't be having sex. Plain and simple. I get that people really just want to enjoy sex with no consequences, but the fact of the matter is, there's always going to be the risk of a pregnancy.

I'm not religious by any means, but it seems self evident to me that when a sperm cell reaches an egg it will grow into a human. To me, that's a life that started at conception. It's literally how we get more humans. 

In the case of rape or medical complications, I get it and totally support abortion. However, these are a small minority of cases and shouldn't make up the argument for the majority. Let's face it, the vast majority of abortion cases stem from being unable to care for the future child either financially or emotionally. 

If the only factor is ""I can't afford/care it"" then that's really unfair to the developing life/fetus/cluster of cells/whatever you want to call it, and you have no business having sex in the first place. Sex isn't a right, it's a privilege.

frl8z8,HilmPauI,Viola Desmond shouldn't have been the new figure on the Canadian $10 bill.,"I understand her historic importance for black people in Canada and her push for human rights, but if we wanted to put an iconic person who wasn't white on the bill I feel like it should have been a Native American or Chinese person or both. 

I don't mean to make it sound like a competition when I say this; but black people in Canada before the 1970s and onward (before Canada saw mass-immigration from West Africa and the Caribbean) were a super minority of people (mainly the ones who came to Canada with the Loyalists as slaves after the American Revolution) and by then segregation in Canada was nearing its abolishment. Native Americans (genocide, forced assimilation, etc) and Chinese people (Chinese head tax, 'oriental' propaganda, and borderline using them as slaves during the transcontinental railway) were more systematically oppressed than black people. I say this despite knowing slavery was abolished in 1834. I'm aware that they went through much of the same issues that Native, Chinese, and Irish people went through. My argument is simply that it happened more to the three (especially Natives) considering they were more in numbers and I feel like they should have gotten the recognition instead.

Again, I don't mean to diminish the suffering that black people went through in Canada nor is my intent to bash the accomplishments of Viola Desmond. Misery isn't a competition but I feel like if our goal was to recognize an iconic minority figure in Canada then it should have been, primarily, a Native American one. If anything they could have added Viola Desmond with an iconic Native, Chinese, or Irish figure.

This is just an opinion I felt sounded controversial and kinda stupid for thinking about (because who cares?). I wanted to know if other Canadians may feel the same way or if I'm just being stupid.

As I watched the 2016 election unfold and the democratic party stole a nomination away from Bernie, it gave me a lot to think about, while the left screamed collusion on trump this was its own party completely sabotaging itself, to which we are seeing unfold once again and it is abundantly clear. I dont believe in socialist ideology never will but we live in a democracy and even he has a right to be a front runner. 

Next if not more the left has a very very vicious identity politics game they play, more then the right and reddit is actually a great place to see this, if you dont agree whole heartedly with there line of thinking you are gonna be canceled not only that the right has a more willingness to chat about disagreements then the left, you watch the YouTube videos where they go to rallies against trump or whatever they will follow you to silence you or berate you to no end how can one see your logic to something if you wont even talk to them? dont get me wrong the few that do get thru and that's for both sides can be really reasonable or also just the bottom of the bucket that plays into the stereotype of what the side is. 

I believe that if you are going to claim tolerance and acceptance for all you need to show it and I believe in anyone being what they want to be, I believe that Anyone should come to our great country and get the fair chance we all had but as for right now those are major points that I see more of a reason to vote trump right now as Biden is MUCH worse and creepy in that.

frklj2,helloem95,Hand shakes are a pointless social norm derived from a time when people carried guns in their sleeves.,"I would absolutely be okay if handshaking didn’t not come back after COVID-19 as the expected thing to do when meeting someone new in an official capacity. The only thing gained from a handshake is the fulfillment of some random social propriety that we deem as important for no reason. Here is my reasoning. A) people do not wash their hands...all the time. Whenever you’re shaking someone’s hand, chances are you’re not only swapping niceties but also the remnants of their last bathroom break. B) people actually form opinions about others from a single hand shake. We have all shook someone’s hand and found their hand a limp noodle or been crushed by someone else’s hand. It’s a bit ridiculous to put so much importance on it when there is no way you can know how good your hand shake is unless you actually ask someone, and no one does that. C) it can be insanely awkward deciding whether a hand shake is warranted or not in so many situations and anything but both people going in for it is a social disaster. 

I’m just saying we would probably all be a bit healthier if we just waved and said hello.",5,1585544297,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frklj2/hand_shakes_are_a_pointless_social_norm_derived/,unpopularopinion,1

frkjvt,Luckman1002,Taylor Swift isn’t Completely Innocent,"So last week the full tape of Kanye talking to Taylor came out and everyone jumped on Taylor’s side and said she did absolutely nothing wrong and Kanye is “cancelled” (give me a break 😂) While Kanye should’ve told Taylor about “that bitch” line and should’ve made us a responsibility to send her the song after he promised to, Taylor isn’t absolved from any guilt. The whole thing is that she was completely disingenuous and tiptoed around the truth up until Kim leaked the tapes. Her whole speech at the Grammys was completely her playing victim when she went on about “when someone tries to take credit for something you did”. SHE APPROVED OF THE FAMOUS LINE!! She was very adamant that he needs to tell his side of the story and gave him her blessing for the very thing she addressed when the world was watching. Then her publicist, as a result of Kanye saying he had an hour long convo with Taylor and she approved of it, tried to downplay this by saying Kanye had only tried to get her to promote the song and that she had warned against “misogynistic lyrics”. Again complete fucking bullshit. The fact is the biggest issue was the “that bitch” line bit Taylor didn’t clarify thing and attacked everything about it and then tried to downplay the level of approval because then there’d be egg on her face. It was only after Kim released the tapes that Taylor completely told the truth of the matter.

frkjlv,Lordbobsaget,I like clowns," 

I like clowns, but the purpose of a clown has become so diluted over the years that I mourn their lost potential.

People never use clowns the way they are supposed to. A clown is hardly supposed to talk. They aren't supposed to be your friend. They shouldn't be talking all friendly to children while making balloon animals for them. Ronald McDonald is an abomination. He represents everything a clown shouldn't be.

The purpose of a clowns outfit is supposed to make him look like this big goofy idiot. You are supposed to make fun of clowns. The ideal clown should be a complete jerk that gets constantly on peoples nerves through pranks, honking, slapstick and then makes horrible related puns afterwards. You laugh at the both the misfortune of both the clown and the angered person who unleashes their wrath upon it. They're supposed to be a modern day court jester. So in a way, you are supposed to hate clowns. But you are supposed to love hating them.

If you hire a clown for a birthday party, they shouldn't be trying to talk to mildly afraid children all friendly while making them balloon animals and doing magic tricks. Oh no, they should be mildly pranking people until they find that one hot headed person who can't take a joke, like an uncle. The clown will declare them a nemesis, give them a wedgie, honk a bike horn every time they try to talk. All the kids would be laughing at how much this clown is annoying your uncle, and how every time he gets angry the clown follows it up with some corny pun. Your uncle knows that they chose to hire this type of clown, so it puts up with it. Until the first cream pie gets thrown, and ruins your uncles new shirt. Then either the uncle leaves to cool off, or it gets physical with the clown making a honk every time he is struck. It doesn't matter who wins, because the true winner is the audience watching the hilarity unfold of your uncle with pie all over his face fight with this idiot with makeup and an awful outfit. The clown doesn't fight back, because he is a master of his craft and is meant to be a punching bag when it reaches that point.

Doesn't sound like your kind of party? It wouldn't be for most people. Few situations would warrant such a master of the art, but when they do you will remember them for a lifetime.

It is for this reason that I still look upon that clown epidemic we had years back and mourn such a horrific waste of potential. This could began a glorious comeback for the clown, but it was ruined by idiots who didn't do it right. If only instead of clowns making headlines by chasing people with knives, they were to throw cream pies at random people and get tackled by bystanders along with other annoying but harmless forms of slapstick. The clown epidemic would have been hilarious, chaotic, awful, and amazing.

The one time clowns started annoying masses of people on a national level they didn't even do it right. I'm tearing up at the thought of it.",6,1585544040,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frkjlv/i_like_clowns/,unpopularopinion,1

frkj78,beepbop24,The way the senate works is stupid,"Before I hear everyone say, “this is the way our constitution works, deal with it”. Yes, I get that. I know it’s not changing anytime soon. I know our country was founded on compromise. I understand that at one time it was a good solution. 

But here’s my problem with it today: California has almost 40 million people, and they are represented by 2 senators. Meanwhile North and South Dakota combined have a population of about 1.65 million people, and are represented by 4 senators total. How in the world is that fair? The legislative branch is the most powerful branch of the US government, and the Senate is the upper house of said branch, making several important decisions. Yet, a combined population of 1.65 million between two states with similar demographics get a larger say in what goes on for the *country* than a state with 40 million people. You can throw in about 10-20 other states too and combined they still won’t match 40 million. 

Honestly, this is so fucked up. Forget about the electoral college for a second. This is actually about who makes the decisions for the *country*.

frkgo1,prettylittlebabyboy,"I don't like when people make mental illness their personality, and the diagnosis of mental illness isn't really that important","I'm not one of those people who think mental illness is fake or is just for attention, i understand it the same way physical illnesses work.

However, I feel like people overstate the significance of a diagnosis. 

The DSM is not some heavenly sent guide book, none of this is objectively set in stone. The diagnostic criteria changes all the time, new diagnosis are added and some are removed. It's based on our understanding of what normal and productive behavior is, as well as what symptoms are commonly seen together.

People act like theres a rigid difference between a normal person and a mentally ill person, people act like everyone with the same diagnosis are the same, people act like when a psychiatrist diagnosis you they're conducting an investigation into the inner depths of your mind (they don't, they just ask you questions). If your having an awfully hard time, you don't need a doctor to tell it to you for it to be true. I know it's necesary in order to speak treatment, but i'm just saying this because i see a lot of mentally ill people on social media gate keep and monolithic ally agree anyone who doesnt have a doctors diagnosis is just an attention seeker. 

Personally i've been seeing psychiatrists since i was 12, and every one of had different ideas of what i was. I spend a lot of my life distraught about this, i just wanted to have a single label to be able to identify with. The online gate keeping in communities is probably a big factor in his.

frk4ki,ThomasRCallahanIII,I Don’t Care How Hot Someone Is If I Can’t See Them Naked,"I’ve never liked when someone tries to be like “Oh look at how attractive this person is” and they point out someone in the room or show me a picture of them with clothes on. I assume they want me to be like “Oh yeah they’re hot as hell” but I genuinely don’t care unless they’re nude. What’s the point of bringing it to my attention if I don’t actually get to see what I want to see? 

I don’t like side-boob, i don’t like lingerie. I don’t like anything that tries to tow the line of being nude, but not being able to see the naughty bits.

I get annoyed when PG-13 movies have sexy moments because I know I’m not going to see anybody actually naked. 

To me it’s like if you tried to tell me how good a Christmas present is, but it’s still in the gift wrap. Until I see what the present is I have no use for it.

I mean if I was eating a sandwich and was like “This sandwich is amazing you’ve got to check this out” and you were like “Can I try a bite” and I was like “No”. Feels like a waste of time right?

I guess the best way for me to explain it is if you can show it on basic cable, then I’m not going to get all excited about it. 

I don’t know maybe it’s just me, but a friend of mine always tries to show me sexy photos of girls on Facebook and she is always like “Look at how hot these girls are” and I feel like an asshole because I just keep thinking “Facebook doesn’t have nudes on it why are you showing me almost naked people with the same enthusiasm as if it were actually naked people?” Like if you’re already choosing to show me photos of girls in their underwear or half-naked dudes in their thirst trap posts that would definitely be considered NSFW then why not just show me nudes? Just cut out the middle man in we’re already doing this.

I don’t know maybe I’m not explaining this right, but it bothers me you know? It doesn’t ruin my day or anything its like a 3/10 max.  I just find it kind of annoying.",15,1585542060,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frk4ki/i_dont_care_how_hot_someone_is_if_i_cant_see_them/,unpopularopinion,1

frk1xd,stevetazz,People who hate superhero movies because they are the same thing every time are wrong,"You don’t have have to like superhero movies. Nobody should care. (Of course I know people do.)  but the excuse is not good. I feel like that’s saying all movies are the same because the plot usually revolves around the pro and antagonist having some sort of conflict. And a lot of the time the protagonist wins. 

Then there is tone of the movies. Would you look at guardians of the galaxy Batman vs Superman and say oh yeah those are the same 2 movies? No most people wouldn’t because one is happy bright and funny and the other one is gloomy dark and serious. 

My final point is that they don’t have “the same story”. For instance Ironman 1 and Spider-Man far from home. Ironman 1 is about a billionaire who has never had to worry about anything in his life then getting captured by terrorists and has shrapnel going to his heart and was held captive in a cave. He had to find away out and escape. He then has to redeems himself because of the destruction he had caused by making weapons. Then the person who he had known his entire life turned on him because tony wanted to stop making weapons. Tony had to kill stane. 

Compare it to: Spider-Man far from home peter Parker having to deal with the death of his mentor and has to start learning how to do good without Tony’s help. Then peter was on a field trip to France were he met Mysterio. Peter befriended him and started to trust him but the entire time Quentin was planning on getting Edith to kill 20 million people with his cgi bots. Peter finds out about his plan and has to stop him. And the end he does. 

So does that seem the same? Again it doesn’t matter if you don’t like the movies I just think that idea is garbage.",8,1585541703,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frk1xd/people_who_hate_superhero_movies_because_they_are/,unpopularopinion,1

No one can afford housing because of it, or healthcare &amp; education if your'e in the U.S. Most of us are barely getting by with little less than a months savings and this whole ""lock down"" is proving it. Two days from now it's going to be april 1st and there will inevitably be people getting evicted and out on the street. Or if they don't get evicted it means they have to deffer the payment which means sooner or later it's going to come crashing back down on them.

People don't know how to properly take care of a cat. If your cat scratches you, it's not bc it's 'bitchy' or hates you, it's bc you aren't being careful and considerate of it's needs. Is the cat supposed to fucking talk and tell you how it feels? They need exercise, walk it and play with it just like you would a dog. Do NOT play with it with your hands, USE TOYS, it will think your hand is a toy and will scratch when playing. This is scientifically proven. They need attention just as much as dogs. They understand when you take care of it, and when you ignore it. The whole 'stigma' of cats being grumpy, angry, and mean is unnecessary. How special can a dog get compared to a cat? Cats are safer and cheaper as well. Scratching hurts, but it won't rip your fucking balls off. Don't throw your cat around expecting it to land on its feet everytime *cough-cough-Alinity-cough-cough* and act surprised.

I’m getting irritated about how often I’m scrolling through my feed and I see another fucking story about someone saying “I found out he has a kid, I packed my shit and left, what do I do now?”

Look. Just because he’s not involved in his child’s life doesn’t mean he’s a shit guy. If he pays his child support then he’s not leaving them on a single parent’s income (and don’t you start coming at me with shit about how that works because I was raised by a divorce attorney and she taught me how that shit works), so he’s doing his end of that. If the birth parents aren’t together because they were bad together, good. The kid’s better off. Or, what if his ex was abusive, and he can’t have a relationship with his child without getting sucked back into everything? I had an ex that I’m pretty sure was trying to get pregnant to trap me and if I couldn’t get out of that I’d have immigrated to another country bc she was that toxic. Sometimes, when somebody does something, it might have to do with their safety more than the possibility of them just being a shitty person. 

I’m not coming at this blindly. My parents were separated for a long time and I didn’t have a fully functional relationship with my father. They got back together when I was 17 and it was the weirdest thing having him back in my house. That’s their story, and I have no qualms with the life they choose to live and I support their decisions fully, but I didn’t need a dad at dinner every night to teach me how to be my own man. I learned my morals on my own, and I learned what kind of shit you take and the kind of shit you don’t on my own too. My mother was the earner, and I learned money skills from her. I didn’t need 2 parents in the house to turn out alright, and I’d be furious if someone decided I did, because that’s not who I am, and nobody has any right to tell me to be somebody else. 

Grow up. If you’re in a relationship with him and he treats you right and the people around him right, let him have the fresh start he’s earned. 

I’m 20 if you want to keep that in perspective. I’ve lived a hell of a lot more than most 20 year olds, so if you criticize me for anything it should be for the fact that I’m not even out of college yet, not a lack of experience.",57,1585540944,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frjvo0/stop_abandoning_your_boyfriendshusbands_bc_you/,unpopularopinion,1

* Let us hold constant that our illustrious leader and their advisers are mostly competent in the area of pertinent concern - as was Stalin and his military cabinet during WWII. I will not discuss his horrific shortcomings in other areas of domestic affairs.
* Let us also hold constant that our divine figurehead has a passable moral compass.
* Dictatorships are tax effective - although absolute surveillance, military, and policing are costly, there are few other government cost centers.
* Dictatorships completely eliminate bureaucracy and red tape. Orders are clear, and action is taken almost immediately with little administrative cost.
* If the dictator is liked, and likable, their power is far more prominent and the population will rally around them far better than the head of an elected party. 
* Dictators will have the ability to make necessary sacrifices without lengthy discourse or administrative push-back.
* Dictatorships allow for crime to be put down hard, with little cost of legal process.

frjnrt,Philsniper,BF4 set a dangerous example for games that effects us today,"Battlefield 4 is by far the best battlefield, hands down. DICE fixed the game really good.
And that’s how it fucked gamers for years to come. It has been a long while but BF4 was really broken when it came out with constant crashes and unbearable bugs. Netcode was ass. People could shoot you behind corners. It was a bad game. But DICE fixed it and proved that if you fix a game people will begin to buy it.  That is where this trend, at least it seems to me, started. RS6 released pretty much broken from how I remember and was fixed up. ESO was released to much hate, fixed up and now is a generally accepted ok game. These games not only proved bad games can be released and fixed later, but showed it was wildly successful to do so, to get the die hard fans first then go for casuals later. Now we are seeing the trend pretty much everywhere with developers sending out half assed games to just fix them later. BFV is a great example. They released a half baked product to market and to this day are still trying to fix it. Fallout 76 was released half baked but they are still fixing it. Anthem was released entirely broken from what I remembered and the fact that Christmas lights were still up in February shows that the game was suppose to be a “release now and finish later” type game. Halo Master Chief Collection released being unplayable and was fixed later.

Just so many things don’t make sense? The pacing is all over the place and the characters all just make the stupidest decisions. Conflict is started from them not revealing information they had no reason not to reveal. It skips us seeing the development of characters, like seeing how Ragnar reacted to his daughter dying, or his wife leaving, and just shows the after math. Rollo flip flops between being loyal to Ragnar and then hating him, the whole first season everyone talks about the great love Legertha and Ragnar have and then he just gives her and his son up for this other chick. 

After the first episode of Season 2 it just skips to four years in the future, which just blew me away. I can’t bring myself to care for any of the characters except Athelsan and Legertha.

First off the fruity smells that comes from women's body wash is far superior to any men's wash I've used. My gf has this apple scented soap that you can smell for hours after and smells terrific. It's nothing crazy, it just says ""Fall Apples"" or some shit like that, all of her products are like that, just simple names and you know what you're getting, it's just apples, or pineapples, or coconuts or whatever that fantastic smell is. Men's body wash is always a guessing game, you go and want to pick up a bottle of Old Spice or whatever and the names are always like ""Pinetree Punisher"" or ""Cannonball Tsunami"" and I'm always like wtf does that even smell like. It's always this weird guessing game of this soap sounds tough, but does it smell good? I don't need to feel like a ""Twister Bomb"" or anything, I just wanna know what I'm smelling and if it smells good.

Second off, the feel of women's products is so much better. My skin always feels dry after using my regular products, but when using hers, my skin feels so soft and smooth the rest of the night. And when using her shampoo and conditioner my hair always feel way more soft and healthy the next few days, I don't get it.

frizms,UnpopularUlterior,The only great M Night Shyamalan movie is The Sixth Sense.,"Initially doesn't seem like an unpopular opinion, but a lot of people consider signs and Unbreakable to be great, as well as Split. But just... No.

Signs is just plain bad. Lots of people bash on the twists, but even the main movie was poorly shot and bland. I've seen people talk about some of the scary scenes, but I don't remember a single part of it working. The Village, still bad, was a better movie because only the twist was really awful. 

Unbreakable is fine until it reveals a twist ending whose entire purpose is sequel bait.

And we get that sequel annnd.... Split is just straight awful except for the parts McAvoy was able to carry on his back. A fantastic performance by the main villain, but everything around thay was awful.",21,1585537118,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frizms/the_only_great_m_night_shyamalan_movie_is_the/,unpopularopinion,1

friyyj,RotenTumato,The prequels are good,"The Star Wars prequels are almost universally hated by fans, and yet I believe that they are not only decent, but actually good. The Phantom Menace, while boring at times, crucially shows the humble beginnings of one of the most evil, wicked people in the Star Wars universe. In addition to providing needed backstory and further enriching this vast universe, it has a kick-ass lightsaber fight and that amazing podracing sequence. Anakin and Jar Jar can certainly be annoying, and it gets a bit boring at times, but it is the worst of the three and I would argue still a good addition to this Skywalker Saga. Attack of the Clones is where things really pick up, providing the growth and development of Anakin’s friendship with Obi-Wan, his relationship with Padme, and the beginnings of his dark side tendencies. It has some awesome action set pieces, never really gets boring, and is pretty much an exciting Star Wars adventure all the way through. The dialogue in this is probably the weakest of the trilogy, and it has brought us memes like the line about sand, but I think the rest of the movie (visuals, overall story,  emotional weight, acting talent by Ewan McGregor, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, etc.) makes up for it, placing this just above The Phantom Menace. Now, Revenge of the Sith is heartbreaking. As it should be. Revenge of the Sith is a tragic tale of two brothers, torn apart by one’s jealousy and desire to save the woman he loves, both of which I feel are very relatable themes. This movie tells the story of the Jedi from Anakin’s point of view, and it really makes you feel for him and understand why he’s so frustrated to not be made Master, for example. Revenge of the Sith is probably in the top 5 best Star Wars movies to date, and really just blew me away. I think all three of these movies are great, and they shouldn’t be hated by so many (especially older) fans.",21,1585537040,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/friyyj/the_prequels_are_good/,unpopularopinion,1

He then ignores my regular texts over the summer and texts me something to the effect of I don’t want a relationship going into college at the end of the summer.   
 FINE. Also, BG: I don’t know the full extent of his mental health, but I do know that he was clinically depressed and anxious (as far as he’s told me). Okay, I can support that. When he reconnected with me over winter break, he revealed that when he shut down over the summer it was bc he was really depressed and “scared to lose me” and that he thought he was in love with me. Fine. If only over the summer I didn’t try to check in with him at least weekly and was myself dealing with depression and anxiety. If I wasn’t trying to get in touch with his friends to make sure he was ok. IF my depression didn’t get worse when I at the end of the day lost someone, I thought was a close friend. 

I told him to get lost bc I tried to help him but wouldn’t get out of his own way to accept that health. I understand people have different levels and different issues, and different coping methods.

frim7u,Onimya,"If you have kids who are nearly/are adults, you shouldn't have more","I think this one is actually unpopular, but hear me out. 

One, it's going to be extremely difficult for your kids to get along and they could literally be old enough to be their mothers. The dynamic is going to be weird, hard to explain, and generally just confusing. It's especially weird after your kids have had kids, or are due to, or are about the age to where they would. 



Why? Well, not all situations would be like mine but I feel like the majority of the ""other kids"" or before kids they had, who would be almost adults, would feel really left out and neglected in any case. I feel like the children they already had should get some say in it if they're over 13ish, but it depends on the situation. 

In my situation, though, I'm 17, my sister is 20ish, and my sister already has 2 kids. I want kids sooner than later, but not within the next 2-3 years obviously. 
About a month or two ago, my mom sat me down and told me she was pregnant. She told me it was intentional, sort of, because she didn't take precautions but also didn't thinks she could get pregnant and her and her boyfriend wanted kids. This is when I was 16. She said she didn't think it'd be a big deal for me since ""you'd be out soon anyways"" and it was extremely out of the blue. There's nothing I could've done about it though, but she had a miscarriage (because she was smoking.. but she won't admit that.) and she's been visiting her boyfriend a lot recently (he's in the military so she has to drive a long while) and she came home today with some pregnancy tests that I don't think she wanted me to notice. 


Now, my mom already barely treats me with respect or like I'm human and this is how it was for my whole childhood. If I disagreed with her at all, ""you're the child, you don't get to decide"" and that's how it is even now. Even if it's things like self expression such as cutting my hair I have to argue about it. 


Generally I think it's absolutely disgusting that 1. she's trying to have more kids with this new guy when she can barely treat her own as human and 2. that when I have kids, hers will still be children by the time mine are babies, and literal children will be ""aunts"" or ""uncles"" or whatever. It just disgusts me and I don't want some stupid complicated dynamic when I'm completely comfortable with what I already have, and I think she should be too. 

Another reason it upsets me is because her boyfriend is young and kind of convinced her into having kids, she didn't really want anymore before him (she always wanted 2 girls and she got them) but he wanted ""kids of his own"" (again, kind of don't feel ""good enough"" for him or her.) I get that he may have wanted to have you know, his own blood and stuff in kids but I don't think that works with my mom's ideals and even if they love each other, hell even if it's a lot, I don't think she should feel pressured to have more kids just because of him and that he can either accept what he has and compromise, or find someone else to make ""his own"" family with.",8,1585535545,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frim7u/if_you_have_kids_who_are_nearlyare_adults_you/,unpopularopinion,1

frijvr,legendwolfA,People who complain about multiplayer matchmaking are just too lazy to get better at the game,"if it's forced crossplay or overpowered items that can kill you in one tap, that's actually a good excuse to why you lost. But ""The enemy is better"" should never be an excuse. 

I've played many multiplayer/competitive games, and the most complaints that I have seen are ""SBMM is fucking broken"" or ""matchmaking is against me"" kind of stuff. So let me get this straight: you're just being bad, and you should see every time when you go against a pro as an opportunity to get better, not as a bad thing.

And if you yourself wanna get better, there are always resources out there to help you out. Take Fortnite, for instance, if you wanna build better, there are plenty of Youtube videos, maps that help you with that. You can also aim better with maps that have moving targets. You can also watch streamers to learn how they rotate, defend, attack, loot, etc. Then there's the replay mode where you get to re-evaluate your playstyle and see where you get wrong. You're just too lazy to search these up. All you need to do is type ""how to get better at X game"" and pick a video.

And even if matchmaking actually work, players would still be able to bypass it by smurfing.",14,1585535306,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frijvr/people_who_complain_about_multiplayer_matchmaking/,unpopularopinion,1

It's also part of this low-effort trend of just tagging other people's content with a meme at the bottom. For some reason, redditors fucking love it.

It's cringe in two ways - it makes me cringe because the person making the meme either (a) thinks it's funny or (b) is following a trend and being a karma whore, and it also just isn't funny, and the reaction/upvotes it gets makes me realise how many people found it funny.

The problem with this argument is that their internal affairs often becomes your problem if you don't deal with them.

Case in point, religious extremism in the middle east led to 9/11. Not dealing with North Korea means they now have nuclear weapons. The US and other countries largely stayed out of the Syrian conflict yet Western countries, especially Europe ended up with millions of people coming to their countries because of this. 

Sure the US can't be the world police and messing in internal affairs can go wrong. But let's stop pretending that doing nothing is always moral and that things will just work themselves out. They often don't and innocent people suffer because of it.",20,1585535244,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frijbq/meddling_in_other_countries_affairs_can_be_the/,unpopularopinion,1

frigu0,Wild_Nightshade,Zombie movies really need to stop being cliche.,"I’m on mobile so please excuse the font.

Typical zombie cliches. Or zombie movie starter pack.

1. Starts with news broadcast of so called “riots” erupting throughout the country or the world.

2. Has extremely badly written characters that one knows instantly they are zombie food within the first sentence.

3. Usually the main character trying to unite with a loved one and must go through hordes of zombies to achieve this.

4. There is usually someone who saves the main character but then gets himself/herself killed later on for being too altruistic.

5. The antagonist is usually a cowardly, white collared, A-hole that endangers the group and makes the stupidest decisions.

6. Movie can’t be complete without booze and smoking for some “character development.”

7. Always have to have a love triangle in which at least one person in the triangle dies.

8. The trapped in a room surrounded with zombies cliche. 

9. Camera angle that has a gap behind the protagonist’s shoulder that 100 percent signifies a jump scare coming up.

10. Someone gets bitten and the group is too moral to kill that person out of mercy. That backfires. This leads to excessive mercy killing throughout the movie.

11. NO ONE IN THE UNIVERSE HAS HEARD OF ZOMBIES.

12. You have the commando, the hot girl, the person with every phobia, the person trying to prove himself, and the person who will secretly back stab everyone just for his/her survival. And the medic, there’s always a medic.

13. Since there’s always a medic, there is always a run to the pharmacy, where they encounter either zombies or bad people.

14. Usually a super religious guy with a cult and they try to kill the main group.

15. There’s usually a person who escaped a horde and tries to warn everyone only to be called crazy, and then shit hits the fan.

16. Guns, guns everywhere.

17. Different zombie classes, such as runners, walkers, crawlers, armored, etc.

18. Zombie outbreak either reason not revealed or the stupidest reason imaginable.

19. When they desperately needs to be silent, they drop something, ensue chase.

20. Excessive horror music. Excessive b-roll of the world in an apocalypse. Excessive b-roll of zombies eating other people.



Sorry for you guys to have to hear my rant but I’m a horror movie addict and love zombie movies and tv shows. However, after watching many movies and tv shows, they feel overall the same to me and everything was so predictable, I should be placing my bets. I’d wish that the writers actually created more original movies that revolves around the psychology horror of having to kill people you used to know rather than excessive gore and screaming. There’s a reason why good zombie movies are meta and break away from the cliche (to some extent).

Recommend me some zombie movies/tv shows while you’re here. Quarantine is boring.",13,1585534951,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frigu0/zombie_movies_really_need_to_stop_being_cliche/,unpopularopinion,1

friecy,Grappler16,Doom Eternal is a bloated overengineered mess of a game that would be infinitely better if half its gameplay features were taken out of it.,"Having to manage a metric fuck ton of different kinds of upgrades (most of which barely affect gameplay at all) along with having different types of ammo, enemies that need to be killed with certain weapons (thereby meaning that each fight feels incredibly scripted) and having a ton of weapons no one asked for (flame thrower, grappling hook, etc) really just weight the game down. It's too much. 

Not to mention the fact that the melee does nothing unless the blood punch is activated. In what other game does melee do absolutely no damage at all? Ideally it should be used to kill smaller enemies without using ammo, but nope. 

Platforming is boring as all fuck, the level design looks cooler in trailers for its verticality but since it means long drawn out segments where nothing happens and you press E to cling to the same walls, double jump and strafe the same chasms, it all really sucks. Who ever thought Doom needed platforming? Just another feature that should've been stripped out. 

And my God the fucking bullet sponge enemies. You either HAVE to kill them with a certain weapon (which makes the game feel like it's forcing rules upon you in what should be a very chaotic fight) or they just take a shit zillion shots to kill. Cacodemons are especially guilty of this. Either you are forced to shoot a grenade in their mouth, you lose all your ammo shooting them, or they one hit kill you. It's bullshit. I should have the choice in how I want to bring an enemy down. 

And the story segments? Best part about it is that the cut scenes are skippable. Again, who asked for story and cut scenes in a Doom game? Whatever happened to the Id of the 90s who said that story in video games is like story in a porno; expected to be there, but not important. Once again, just something else that should have been cut. 

To Id Software: Doom is fundamentally a very very simple game. Point gun at monster, press fire, blood splatter, all while a heavy metal riff plays in the background. That's it. Nothing more needs to be added to that. That formula is in itself perfect. Timeless. If you really wanted to you could endlessly release the same basic game with prettier graphics every couple of years, and no one would care. Shoving in so much needless stuff makes the game worse, not better.",4,1585534679,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/friecy/doom_eternal_is_a_bloated_overengineered_mess_of/,unpopularopinion,1

Hell, the EU is barely surviving and it's dealing with relatively minor differences in culture between It's few constituent nations.

Does anyone expect the CCP to give up its imperial ambitions and turn China into an actual democratic republic?

I love Star Trek. I'm just saying that 54 years after the first episode aired we are no closer to the utopian, internationalist world Roddenberry envisaged.

fri209,TheMuffingtonPost,The Idubbz drama just shows that the word “simp” doesn’t really really mean anything.,"So this idubbz shit has been really weird. It honestly really fascinating to see so many people feel personally betrayed by Ian’s decision to not care about his girlfriends Onlyfans account. But also, I’m seeing a lot of people call him a simp, and I’m just curious.....how the fuck does that make you simp? To my understanding, the word was used to describe a guy who is kind of going out of his way to be kind or generous to a girl in order to fuck her, sort of like a white knight though not quite the same. I always kind of knew that people online would just use the word simp to describe any guy who treats women with any semblance of kindness or charity, but this idubbz drama has pretty much just cemented in my mind that this is the case. Dudes online will call anyone a simp for treating a woman with respect because it seems like they can’t fathom the idea of a woman as anything other than their sole sexual property. That’s why all these fuckboys feel so betrayed, it’s like “how dare you allow your girl to be sexually liberated on her own terms in whatever way she wants, you’re supposed to call her a whore for that!”. If you think Ian is a “simp” cause he doesn’t care if his girl wants to make money by posting revealing pictures online, then I think you’re most likely just too insecure to see a your girlfriend and her body as anything other than your property, and the word simp doesn’t fucking mean anything anymore.",0,1585533312,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fri209/the_idubbz_drama_just_shows_that_the_word_simp/,unpopularopinion,1

fri0ko,TheGuyWhoCummies,RGB in custom built computers is pretty tacky.,"Now of course people are entitled to include as much RGB into their builds as they want, at the end of the day it's your computer/build. With that said, personally I've always thought it looks incredibly tacky. That's not to say you should just get a boring box and call it a day, you can make builds look good, and even use a glass-panel to show off the components. Great cable management on a nice clean setup, especially with components that pair well together aesthetically, looks much nicer than a laser light-show.

To me it's the equivalent of putting underglow on a car, some people might think it looks ""cool"" but the majority of people will agree that most cars look better without it. Not to mention it's very distracting (to me at least) to have this colour changing light-show going on beside me when I'm trying to focus on the monitor, I'd honestly rather have a boring Dell case beside me than an RGB infested one.

frhygd,libertysailor,Branding or personal bias can be a pragmatic justification for buying a product.,"To lay out the logic in its most structured form:

P1: Satisfaction comes from the perception of value 

P2: Satisfaction is the highest objective when making a purchase. 

P3: Branding and bias can heavily influence perceived value, even after the life of the product has been exhausted. 

C: Branding and bias can heavily influence which product will be the best purchase. 

If part of the enjoyment of that product is the brand itself, or the psychological benefit of believing that you have a superior product, then whether or not it's ""objectively better"", it's a better product for you. At the end of the day you want a product that's going to satisfy you the best, and satisfaction arises from the perception of value. 

This potentially might not be true for everything, but it is for many things. 

For instance, often times you're willing to buy an article of clothing because of the brand. In this case you *feel* nicer even if others don't perceive you the same way. It could be made with the same mediocrity as your average item, at the end of the day, but for you it will still offer the better experience.",4,1585532920,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frhygd/branding_or_personal_bias_can_be_a_pragmatic/,unpopularopinion,1

To me it’s a preferable alternative to the dull silence that one would usually endure, even if the music fucking sucks balls (which more often than not, it does). I get the feeling that often when people complain about this sort of thing, they’re projecting their hatred for whatever genres they typically hear played out loud on the bus or subway. 

I honestly think people who wear headphones but have their volume up real high are worse. With them you can only hear a vague glimpse of whatever is being played that still manages to penetrate your ear drums. It’s like when you’re sitting at a bar and you’re not really interested in the game that’s being displayed on the TV screen on the opposite end of the bar but it’s still annoying that you can’t fully see what’s going because that one guy keeps standing in the way. 

Also, why are they playing it that loud? Do they know how damaging that can be for their ears? Like enjoy your tinnitus buddy, hope it’s worth it.

frhne1,Dovescali,You have no right to take away something from your child is they bought it themself or with money that was not yours.,"Title is kinda long, sorry for that. But here goes my unpopular opinion.

So, say your kid (a teenager, for this example) did something bad or did not get good grades. You want to punish them and decide taking away the laptop that they bought with their own money that they've earned (by a part time job, per say) is a good idea. Now, I disagree with this. That is THEIR property. Yes they live in your house, but that is something THEY'VE bought with THEIR money. Not your money. If it was that would be a totally different story. Now say they got the laptop/money from a friend or a relative. STILL. NOT. YOUR. MONEY/PROPERTY. It's not yours, you did not play a role in the purchase/gift, so you are not entitled to that laptop. I think my opinion is unpopular because a lot of parents seem to think this way, or because they live in your house, they have to obey your rules. While that is true, that laptop is theirs and you need to keep your hands off of it. 

Now, onto alternative punishments. 

Taking away WiFi. If you're the one paying for the WiFi, you can certainly take it away. This will make their laptop/phone/tablet/gaming opportunities limited.

No hanging out with friends. Some may disagree and I respect that, but there's only so many punishments to choose from.

Take away something you DID buy. You're entitled to what you have bought for them (not including essentials, or anything too crazy).

No more allowance. This is a well known punishment and often used by several parents.

The list goes on, but I personally think that taking away an item owned by your child or given to them is a big no-no. I'd love to see what others think about this, and while I do expect to see a lot of agreements, i still think this opinion is quite unpopular.",113,1585531710,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frhne1/you_have_no_right_to_take_away_something_from/,unpopularopinion,4

I've seen a ton of this on reddit, saying everyone's stupid and both political parties are bad, that there's nothing good about government and you shouldn't trust any institutions. 

Do people realize how much energy they're wasting saying this? The people they're attacking probably won't change their stance. You're not going to get a change in policy by sitting behind a computer and complaining about life without doing anything to help make that change happen.

The best leaders are the ones who are realistically optimistic, who practice stoicism: to work within to confines of society and create positive change.

frhkaj,jsmetalcore,"Right-Libertarianism aka American Libertarian is a collectivist ideology, as it lacks social mobility","I'm going to try to keep this short with a few main points. I'm going to post links as supporting evidence so you can see where I got my information from and so I can write less. Some people probably haven't even read this, downvoted the post, got trigged by the title and wrote a comment.

To get everyone on the same page I'm using this definition of collectivist **""Collectivism, any of several types of social organization in which the individual is seen as being subordinate to a social collectivity such as a state, a nation, a race, or a** [**social class**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/social-class)**. Collectivism may be contrasted with** [**individualism**](https://www.britannica.com/topic/individualism) **(*****q.v.*****), in which the rights and interests of the individual are emphasized.""**

[https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/collectivism)

**Social Class**

Social Classes can be inherently collectivist if it is rigid. This is because people will become associated with their social classes rather than the individual themselves. An example of this would be elitism, the rich view that they are superior to everyone who earns less than them. Now in a pure capitalist economy, not everyone will be receiving an education or be receiving health care. This will keep them in their social class and they won't be able to move up.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_class#Three-level\_economic\_class\_model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_class#Three-level_economic_class_model)

**Social Mobility**

This is the most important aspect if a ideology wants to be individualistic. The poor must be able to move up and the rich must be able to move down. Now according to the UN, social programs helps everyone to compete in the market. As it provides universal education/healthcare, labor laws, unions, etc This is why the Nordic countries have the highest social mobility in the world.

[https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/Social-Mobility-2018-PolicyBrief.pdf](https://www.oecd.org/els/soc/Social-Mobility-2018-PolicyBrief.pdf)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_mobility#Patterns\_of\_mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Patterns_of_mobility)

However, without social programs inequality increases and the wealthy continue to accumulate more wealth. Whereas the poor become poorer. This happened under Pinochet in Chile, he made the economy worse with the help of the Chicago Boys and the influence of Milton Friedman.

(Can't find my original link that has the economic history of Chile before Pinochet to the modern era.)

**Unions/Labor Laws**

Unions played a large role in ending child labor and improving wages/working conditions. Before they were enacted and enforced people were working 14+ hours a day for little pay, no breaks, no job security, and there was no guarantee that you would even be paid.

However, Right-Lib during the 19th century opposed the legalization of unions. As they viewed that unions interfered with the market.

frhjja,politicsnerd67,R/amitheasshole is biased against men.,"I’m a woman btw. I’m against discrimination against both genders. I will call out discrimination against woman and a women. I’m sick and tired of the discrimination women face. I’m also sick and tired of the discrimination against men. I’m sick and tired of discrimination against anyone and double standards. Double standards need to die. I’m glad most people on that sub aren’t the kinds you have to interact with (mostly) irl. 

I’ll give an example of what I’m talking about. Here’s a link to a couple AITA posts:


https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a7z9y9/aita_for_trying_to_kick_him_out_after_sex_when_he/

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bgl2bg/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_out_of_my_place_after_we/

One of these posts involves a girl who tried to kick a guy out of her place after she slept with him cause she didn’t want him staying the night. The judgement on that post was ruled NTA. The commenters were saying that the guy is an asshole, he’s not entitled to stay at her place and he’s rude for acting like he is.

The other post involves a guy who did kick a girl out of his place after she slept with him cause he didn’t want her staying the night. This girl also asked him if she could wear some of his clothes to bed. The day after, she texted the OP saying that he was an asshole for not letting her stay the night when she “put out” on the first date. The judgement was ruled YTA. The commenters were saying that if someone is going to your house to sleep with you late at night, it’s assumed that they will stay over and the OP should’ve planned for that. They also said the OP made this girl feel used.

WTF Reddit?! So if a girl doesn’t want a guy to stay over after she’s ok because the guy is a douche because she shouldn’t act like he’s entitled to stay at her place? But if I guy tells the same thing to a girl, he’s a dick and a user? Really? The OP has to plan for her to stay over? Why can’t she plan to get a ride? She’s 20 years old. She can do this shit. I’m her age and I could do this shit. And the fact that she thinks he owes her a nights stay because she slept with him on the first date screams entitlement. If a guy said that to a girl, AITA members would say he’s an asshole. You willingly slept with him. You don’t get some reward for that. 

And this whole “He made her feel used thing”. Seriously? He doesn’t want some girl he’s known for a very short time to spend the night at his house and for some reason you equate that with being used? The OP never said he only wanted sex and was leading her on. He also never said he wasn’t going to see her again. Even if he did not want to see her again, that doesn’t make him a user. He’s only a user if he tells her he wants a relationship but he really wants sex.

You can’t expect a first date to lead to more just because you slept with the other person. It’s a first date FFS. You’re just getting to know each other. Neither of you know if you want something yet. If you don’t want to have sex with someone you’re not going to date, then wait until you become exclusive to have sex with them. 

I personally believe both of these people are NTA. It’s very entitled to expect a stay at someone’s place because you slept with them. At least ask them if you can stay. Plan your own transportation. As an adult, you are responsible for that. No one else is unless you communicated prior that someone else will be responsible for your method of transportation.",32,1585531286,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frhjja/ramitheasshole_is_biased_against_men/,unpopularopinion,3

frhihj,slowcarfastna6,Cigarettes should not be legally sold in America,"Not sure if this is unpopular, but there is so much evidence suggesting cigarettes are one of the worst things you can ingest. I find it hard to believe that companies can make money off something so incredibly harmful to the human body.

According to the CDC, over 480,000 people die in America alone every year as a direct result of smoking cigarettes. Also, over 40,000 die in America as a result of second hand smoke. Smokers' lifespans are shortened on average by 10 years as well. 

With all this virus craze going around about how many people it will kill, it had me looking around at other things that cause a mass amount of deaths per year. I was astonished at the numbers that cigarettes alone cause. 

I get that it is one's personal choice to ingest whatever they want. However, I don't believe that I, as an American, should advocate for something to be legally sold that has zero positive benefits for the population. Alcohol, in small quantities, has no harmful affects. Just one puff of a cigarette can increase your risk for Cancer and other health ailments. It's time to bring attention to one of America's biggest killers that is in plain sight.

frhe1n,ThePriestEnricoPucci,Circumcision isn’t genital mutilation and I can’t stand how most Europeans view the practice of circumcision in a bad light.,"Please, for the love of Christ, stop calling male circumcision genital mutilation when in actuality it really isn’t. 

The foreskin is completely unnecessary to have on a dick and an individual is more likely to get medical issues down the line while having one. Take it from me, I had a uncircumcised dick for about 16 years of my life and it was practically impossible to clean because I had developed phimosis and I couldn’t pull the foreskin all the way back to clean it. Do you know how embarrassing that is, for a teen unable to clean his dick because he never got circumcised at birth? I’m only comfortable sharing this because of my anonymity. Then when I got circumcised, my dick look noticeably bigger and overall just better looking and I can actually clean my dick properly. That and the reduced risks of getting a infection all due to a little snip of some useless foreskin.

Now, what IS genital mutilation is female circumcision where their clit is cut off. That right there is fucked up because they won’t even feel any stimulation during sex. That’s equivalent to having the head of my dick chopped off.

Male circumcision is not genital mutilation, my dick is still functioning properly and just has a better aesthetic and is healthier. Please, get your child circumcised when they are born, because it will just lead to health complications later on. The argument of the baby having no consent is so damn stupid, you’re doing him a favor.

frh5dr,InsiShar,A bill was passed to protect the development of 5G equipment and we need to do something about it.,"I don't give a care if you think I'm a tinfoil hat wearing man for saying this is fucked and needs to be stopped asap. To the people who keep saying EMF is harmless - it isn't; clearly. The fucking workers THEIRSELVES building cell towers get burns and blisters on their skin just by the heat emitted from them. They report headaches ALL the time. Their reports are constantly overlooked and you can always see builders saying they feel in danger, just google search it and you'll get a shitton of results. There were rats exposed to a large amount that grew tumors. \~ [https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/cellphones/index.html](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/topics/cellphones/index.html); the tumors in the rats were Schwannomas (heart)/malignant (BRAIN, WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE IS FUCKING CONCERNED ABOUT)/Benign, malignant and complex combined (adrenal glands)

I saw a stupid YouTube video questioning why we don't see an increase in brain tumors if this has the potential to cause brain tumors and why it isn't seen to develop in human vivo. It's fucking because cancer development in human vivo is so vague that it can take over 25 years to develop. There's essentially no test for cancer in an actual controlled setting done over that extensive of a time period. I'm amazed at how much people don't take that into consideration and just make a point of how we don't see it, because of fucking course we don't. The fact we don't see it means literally nothing. It's virtually impossible to evaluate definitively in human vivo with how inconsistent development rates in humans are, these rat and mice trials need to be taken seriously - and I haven't seen a single controlled study where someone is sat in between three cell towers while turned on over extensive period of time and I probably won't see any considering how injured workers get from being around them. So that's an insane point to make to support the EMF being harmless agenda.

The last point is probably because of how misunderstood cancer detection itself is. Most cancer cases from what I understand are diagnosed at later stages compared to being detected early, especially since early detection can improve mortality rate, but mortality rate itself is not necessarily decreased for some cancers besides the most apparent ones like mouth, but then you can go on about how some of those cancers simply do not have proper treatment. For brain tumors, it doesn't help that symptoms are extremely vague; so does it not help that liver cancer, and so on aren't always apparent to be cancer in symptoms. The most common symptoms for brain tumors especially early stage in fact are among the most common illnesses like head aches. Not to mention that different forms of cancer are detected by (x) test that (r) disease might not be able to be detected by. I'd be barely amazed by how much cancer is looked over simply by how much these tests which yield negative results for an illness it was confused over. And overall, autopsies are not done to detect cancer a lot; in fact they often aren't even done at all, but it isn't done nearly enough to fully detect cancer death rates in un-tested cancer; for example, most of the time they're only going to do tests like blood samples, especially I assume since the cost to use all of these testings are extensive; [https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autopsy-decision](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autopsy-decision) \- blood samples don't detect ANY cancer virtually besides leukemia, lymphoma and other blood-type cancers so to suggest that we understand deaths by un-detected cancers is mute, we don't.

People are constantly spouting about how low-level of EMF won't harm you, I don't think they understand what low is. Around 10 V/m can be considered to be high. These towers each ALONE can release around 10,000 V/M when close depending, and as I said above, they're building this shit right next to homes and in the public where you're walking. Here's a guy driving in a car STILL picking up 500 V/M in a neighborhood via active mobility; [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ewv3uXg250](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ewv3uXg250), whether or not the metal in his car used was able to absorb some of it as metals like copper and so on are known to be able to do so and if it only entered via window is subjective, but you can see readings equal and higher in streets alone. Remember, you'd be sitting next to this with nothing besides your essentially paper or rock walls which don't absorb this CONSTANTLY paired with your regular appliances. To assume this can't harm you with all of the above given is hilarious, let alone assuming that being on streets with these cell towers surrounded by nothing won't.

Long story short, it's beyond me if you think I'm paranoid. I simply know that you should be more concerned; and that was blatant proof.

Women will go on and on about how they have to deal with men being assholes, but when the guy has any issues at all, she's the one that holds all the cards in the relationship.


This isn't the 1950s anymore. Modern relationships require men to be a lot better in relationships. The caveat to this is that men inexperienced with relationships might not know what reasonable limits for a partner are. Suddenly the guy is expected to offer tons of emotional support, deal with insecurities, be someone's rock, and show their woman that they are loved and cared for. Expecting things to go the other way is easily labeled by women as toxic and selfish and we've put so much stigma against unhappy women in relationships that we'll straight up ignore men's unhappiness until they're literally being attacked.

Basically a guy turned 21 and due to the current state of the world he can’t go to a club so his parents set up a fake club for him to have a drink. 

Here’s the link: https://time.com/5810620/family-club-quarantine/

If you read the comments on this video seemingly everyone was praising the parents. I just don’t understand it. Had they given him thousands of dollars for college or a great gift for his birthday that has a positive effect on his life I’d get it. I feel like alcohol is so pushed in society that people, particularly in the US, view being able to drink legally as a rite of passage when it really shouldn’t be in my opinion. It’s just always seemed so ridiculous and silly to me. Maybe I was raised differently but alcohol has never been in my life.",14,1585527995,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frgodp/being_able_to_legally_drink_alcohol_is_not_a_rite/,unpopularopinion,8

frgmsa,GamerCat2011,Redditors are the lowest form of human,"
I hate Reddit so much but I can’t stop using it. People are so entitled and farm karma like it’s some type of drug and they randomly start arguments with people. But mods don’t do anything about it. Most mods are fucking losers. They remove post they disagree with and they make their own rules. Mods are like the mall cops of Reddit. People have the need to bully someone till their dead. Remember “We did it Reddit” where redditors accused some random person of being the Boston bomber, so redditors gave him so many death threats until he committed suicide. But shit gets even worst when you dig deeper into this virgin hellhole, along time ago some kid said on YouTube that he doesn’t like Minecraft and that keanu Reeves isn’t god and redditors gave him a shit ton of death threats. That kid was like seven years old. But who cares about that kid’s mental heath? It’s all about that sweet,sweet,karma. Most Redditors have nothing going in their lives, no kids, no family, no up comming wedding, or a job so they sit in their room all day and look at Reddit to farm that precious karma. Redditors get away with a lot of shit too, Redditors are anti religion and very pro atheists and very anti Americans and anti conservative. They also give you death threats if you don’t use Reddit and you use another site like Instagram or 9gag. Never forget about the unnecessary toxicity. If you are a mobile user, redditors claim that you are not a true redditor and you will get death threats, Light mode too. If you screenshot you’re computer or phone and you have lightmide activated, people will downvote you to hell and put stupid shit in the comments like “My eyes burn”",14,1585527831,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frgmsa/redditors_are_the_lowest_form_of_human/,unpopularopinion,2

But do we really know if Mr. Rogers is genuinely a great person? He is known from his TV shows. Who’s to say that his actions, as wholesome as they may seem, was just an act? What if the Mr. Rogers we seen was just a persona?

I believe this applies to just about every single celebrity as well. We rarely ever seen how they act without thousands of cameras or a live audience to applaud them for their actions. I’m only singling our Mr. Rogers over the rest because he has the reputation of almost being the wholesome person alive, when few of us have ever got to know him as a person. Therefore most of us cannot make that claim with solid proof besides what he’s done on TV. Even the charities he has done through his life could just be a publicity stunt. 

My point is that we can never truly say if Mr. Rogers is a great or terrible person as we never knew him personally. He could a great person, or a awful human being behind the scenes.

I think all is just some random stuff that happenes. I don't think giving life to someone is a miracle and that life itself is the thing you should be the most thankful for. 

You think you do something wonderful when you have children? You just need it because it's an instict of the human species, otherwise you'd mentally suffer. So what you do? You decide to have a child with someone so you won't suffer from not having any and let your child to experience all the same forms of suffering you already know.

I think the most ethical thing we could do is to don't let conscious life continue on earth and just make the best of ourselves until we all die and the endless need to cause suffering would be over.

Reddit is bad for politics. R- Politics is a one sided, circlejerk echo chamber that add nothing to the discussion. It is not just limited to this sub however. The system of subreddits makes outside opinions and thoughts get completely annihilated due to the structure of it all. If a subreddit is centered around one political view, all the people in it will swarm anyone with a different idea. The system of downvotes allows this. When a post gets downvoted below 0, people now have to click it to see it. Most mods on political subreddits will just delete anything with downvotes. To fix this, I would suggest allowing creators of communities to switch off the downvote- hidden feature. Also, a new politics subreddit would be needed.",6,1585526368,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frg8qf/reddit_is_bad_for_politics/,unpopularopinion,8

frg80o,BillGoats,Criminals and even violent offenders need help and don't deserve revenge.,"Shockingly often I see redditors applaud violent revenge in videos of crimes. Someone steals a backpack and gets stomped in the head multiple times, ending up motionless on the road, and the majority response is that they deserved it.

I heard somewhere, sometime that anything anyone ever does is what they consider the best course of action in the moment. This simple idea really stuck with me since and I believe it has helped me become a more forgiving and empathic person.

We all have different backgrounds and even genes. There may be no gene for crime or dishonesty, but there are certainly circumstances in which the best plan for survival really is theft.

Some criminals are empathic people who avoid drama and violence and probably feel bad fof their victims. Maybe they rationalize their actions by convincing themselves that their victim probably has insurance, they'd understand if they knew the circumstances etc.

Others may be fundamentally good people, but also neurotic or anxious for whatever reason. Their instinctive response to threatening situations (which naturally arise with crime) might be to fight back. Not because they want or need to but because of fear.

Then there are cases where someone randomly hurts or even kills strangers. Even then I think it's quite obvious that something is wrong with them. My opinion is that they never chose to be that way. Maybe they were victims themselves at some point. Maybe they never received a proper upbringing and education and so never learned proper norms/morals. Maybe they have mental issues from untreated trauma. Maybe they have undiagnosed brain damage. Etc. etc.

I am all for *isolating* these people and for using violence to the degree necessary to detain them, but beyond that rehabilitation should be the ultimate goal.

To be clear, I understand that self defense is sometimes necessary or at least considered so under pressure. If someone attacks your loved one l am not suggesting you ignore it or gently interfere. I definitely get the *immediate* violent retribution. What I am against however is the continued violence against a neutralized threat. That's not justice to me, but simply disgusting.",28,1585526297,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frg80o/criminals_and_even_violent_offenders_need_help/,unpopularopinion,5

I don’t want to spend thirty minutes watching two siblings have a party and figure out how to cover it up before the parents get back from some trip. (Just giving an example of a terrible cliché).

Point is; I prefer dramas. An example would be my favorite show; Criminal Minds. It’s excellently written and thought out.

It sounds like when you’re listening to your favorite song in the car and your friend starts screaming the lyrics while you’re trying to hear the actual song. Pure techno remixes are even worse. Like the remix of Sweet Dreams are Made of This by the Eurythmics. That’s just a cheap ripoff rendition that makes the song sound like crap.

frfvt6,NoTornadoTalk,The new Half Life: Alyx is extremely overrated!,"So the new VR only Half Life game came out recently and people are making statements about it being the best VR game ever, a true ""game changer"", 10 out 10 perfect, etc.

Yet...it does literally nothing new in the VR gaming world and what it does it doesn't even do WELL. Gun mechanics are years old, inventory is the worst, brain dead bullet sponge enemies are the worst, the ""impressive OMFG PHYSICS!"" in the game center around common objects that can *move around*...no physics based puzzles, no crafty use of advanced physics...just stuff you can move around on counter tops and racks...you can't even open door handles with your gun or anything. It's completely standard fare and no where near the level of most popular VR games really.

Honestly the only thing it really has going for it are it's better than average but still not amazing or unique graphics and the story that ends pretty goddamn well but is pretty much a sludge the whole way there.

Over all I'd give it a 7 out of 10 if I'm being nice. Seriously, the VR mechanics here aren't just odd they're bad. You can't switch which hand you hold you weapon with on the fly...you pull magazines from you *back*...no melee...annoying mini games every time you have to unlock stuff...no jumping, no running...

It's really mediocre as fuck...all these people praising it I swear it's the first time they've played a VR game or those that aren't new either have played very little quality VR titles or have forgotten competely how good other VR games are.

frfv93,Moist_Banana_Nana,"The breed of dog matters when adopting, encouraging people to adopt random shelter puppies or mutts is irresponsible","When getting ANY type of pet it takes a lot of time and research to find what fits with you, your home, your lifestyle, and your family.

One of the most common and diverse pets are dogs, with 331 dog breeds recognized by the World Canine Organization made for various tasks.

Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't adopt dogs from a shelter, every dog deserves a home BUT it is irresponsible to not do your research on the dog you are going to get and not understanding the breeds that make up the dog.

Purebreds are not fully black and white but we do understand their temperament more than a mutt.  Dogs like Huskies and Malamutes have a VERY high prey instinct making them aggressive to small animals and children unless properly trained, German Shepherds and Pitbulls are very protective towards their owners unless they are properly trained and socialized, etc. so getting a mutt makes it a little more difficult to pinpoint exactly how the dog is going to react.  

When looking at adopting a dog rather than buying a dog you should always do extensive research to figure out what is best for you.  Getting some random mix because you're ""saving an animal"" is a terrible idea.  I would strongly recommend finding breed-specific shelters with purebreds AND mixes that contain what you are looking for.

Often times with adult dogs they will figure out their temperament while in the shelter but with puppies, it is a LOT different.   I've seen a lot of people get a mix puppy for it to grow up and be a terror because it just doesn't fit with the type of home.  I've seen people get pitbull mixes who need to be with a single person home rather than with small children/small animals, I've seen people get boxer mixes when they don't have an active lifestyle, I've seen people get retriever mixes when they want a guard dog.",12,1585525014,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frfv93/the_breed_of_dog_matters_when_adopting/,unpopularopinion,6

I many countries it is culture to eat cats and dogs like how different countries have different foods. It just been a traditional recipe throughout the years.   
                
2. Eating a cow is just like eating a cat                              
I am veggie, and this is one of my main reasons so. If you accept to eat animals, you are basically eating your pets. The only real difference is that you are attached to your pet. If you had a pet cow you would probably get attached to it and not want to eat it and so why is it different to your pets? In my opinion it's not. It is the same. And I don't oppose people eating meat so I don't oppose people eating pets.

frfr84,pageygreen,I hate when the protagonist in a movie chooses not to or is discouraged from killing/beating up the villain.,"Spoilers for multiple movies ahead. I’ve seen this happen way too many times in movies. Why shouldn’t they do it? There’s always one side character who  says something like ‘It’s not worth it’ or ‘Let it go’, but.. why? I don’t see the point in letting the bad guy in a movie free without punishment especially if the villain was a major asshole throughout the movie. It just shows that the character has weak resolve AND allows the villain to walk away without any sort of consequences for their actions. Take the ending of the Gimp scene in Pulp Fiction for example. Stone cold justice. There's absolutely no reason for justice NOT to be served in that particular scene. Conversely, you have the Beast vs. Gaston scene where the Beast chooses NOT to drop Gaston to his demise. And what did that get him? A literal stab in the back and who knows what else if Gaston hadn't accidentally fallen off. Of course we shouldn’t solve all issues through violence and I’m not advocating that in any way, but if you’re the main character in a movie and the antagonist killed your family or plotted your murder or demise then you are 100% justified for giving that character an ass whooping. Given, this obviously doesn’t apply to all movies (e.g. the last scene of Se7en), but I’d like to see justice served more times than not. 

As a point of reference, this post was inspired by the scene where Harry Potter DIDN’T KILL Bellatrix in Order of the Phoenix.

frfqug,Indoire_1,Audiobooks are better than physical books and listening to music,"You are able to listen to an audiobook anywhere. I have got through around 30 books in the past year from just audiobooks. You can listen when your commuting, training, gaming, relaxing, bored, running, studying, working and literally 1000 more different ways. They are informative, inspiring, attention grabbing and amazing just like the normal book except you don't NEED to make time to listen to them.

I have heard arguments that books are better because 'you are reading them'. I personally don't get this, I have read quite a few books, I've read books i couldn't put down and I've read books that took me months to finish. I know I can read, I don't think not reading the book has affected me in anyway, if anything I feel as though I'm taking more in from the audiobook. The only major difference I have found between them is that I can listen to an audiobook whenever I want whereas I borderline have to plan to read a book, almost making it feel like a chore.

I also feel as though audiobooks are a extremely great substitute to music. I'm not saying all the time, I still listen to music quite frequently but i find myself listening to the same songs every couple of days. An audiobook allows me to listen to something new, get engaged in a different world or live through the eyes of another, all while doing a totally monotonous task.

Back in the height of Ancient Rome, masters would name their slaves after gods. You would have people adopt the most ridiculous names. That’s why when we study our names we often see that it means either a certain quality/characteristic, a virtue, or some god. 
The name Victor/Victoria - Named after a goddess, Victoria
The name Mark/Marcus - after Mars
And you can go on and on and discover that all our names are named after something. 

We often tend to separate names as being either conventional and unconventional, but the truth is that all names, to some degree, have a unique history and were unconventional at one point.",8,1585524217,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frfn5w/unconventional_names_princess_summer_apollo/,unpopularopinion,4

frfl8v,Halituth,Fallout 3 is a better overall experience than Fallout New Vegas,"Some time ago I decided to get New Vegas to give it a try. I first got into Fallout 3 around 2010 or so and thought it was a masterpiece. It's a lonely, terrifying, broken and desperate world, but will reward you with exploration in the form of bobbleheads, unique weapons and armor, interesting things you'd never otherwise find. 

So after a deep plunge into Elder scrolls (Skyrim and Oblivion, gave ESO a try it's not my thing) I made the decision to ignore the hate and try Fallout 4. It's a big hell yeah from me on this gem.

Here comes Fallout New Vegas. It's gorgeous, smooth, well written, then 20 some hours in, I start to notice that I feel like I'm on a rail, being delivered to all the places of significance, and start exploring more, but going through the map looking for directions to head, I had essentially made a big circle and there isn't that much to run into. 

I have an old post somewhere when I first started FNV and went on about how great it was, and it is, but FO3 is a truly one of a kind experience. FO4 feels like a more appropriate sequel to me because the main focus of 3 and 4 is to find your last family member, and entering a broken world that develops alongside you. The Capital and the Commonwealth really feel like home.

TL;DR in my opinion, New Vegas is the weakest of the 3,4,NV argument.",3,1585524026,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frfl8v/fallout_3_is_a_better_overall_experience_than/,unpopularopinion,2

frfkel,--Ty--,"Reddit, for all its use, is a clunky website, missing basic functionality and features, with an un-intuitive user interface and browsing experience, poor mobile optimization, and an aesthetic that looks like it's from 2009. It survives simply because no one else has yet made a competing product.","***Missing Basic Functionality***: We live in an age where photos &gt; words in terms of popularity and prevalence. And yet, to be able to include more than one photo in a post, we have to upload them to a third-party image hosting service, like Imgur, and then come back to reddit and drop a physical link.

***Poor Mobile Optimization***: I've experienced extremely poor performance on multiple common smartphones, with comments failing to post, typing proceeding at a rate of 1 character per second, pages freezing, etc. All phones and browsers were up-to-date at the time.

***Aesthetic:*** I mean, yeah. This one's subjective, I grant you, but the browsing experience really does just feel like you're on a website from the late 2000's. 

&amp;#x200B;

***It Survives Only Because There's No Competitors***: Facebook is for social networking with friends. Instagram is for the sharing of photos/videos only. Twitter is for the sharing of short, concise posts, and for connecting individuals to big businesses/organizations/celebrities/etc. For the sharing of large, thought-out posts and discussions, however, Reddit is currently the only real option. If a competitor comes along, who streamlines the visual interface and browsing experience, who rolls image and video hosting directly into the program, and who adds a few more features I can't think of, I think it would give Reddit a run for its money. Reddit survives simply because it already has so many users, and no one wants to be the first to switch to a smaller platform.",1,1585523937,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frfkel/reddit_for_all_its_use_is_a_clunky_website/,unpopularopinion,0

She is working as much as she can to afford the best prenatal care and she is obviously quite young, but she understands how big of a deal this is.

I think sports games take a lot of hit from the communities saying just go play the sport when it’s unrealistic to do so just like shooter games.

Just as in sports you can’t really go outside and shoot someone or even have access to a gun. If you can say just go do it in real life to sports games you can also say the same about shooters.

If that weren't the case, why is it that the traits not rooted in biology are the only ones that we really value? Perseverance, kindness(?), generosity without a motive, ambition, etc. 

Now, I realize I'm somewhat clutching at straws with this one. After all, it's hard to envision anything that isn't rooted in our biology. But it stands to reason that a species with a less distasteful ancestry would provide much more to its own community, assuming it has one.",2,1585521849,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frez5e/does_anyone_else_have_a_certain_level_of/,unpopularopinion,1

Or maybe it will. I've had my own opinion changed a couple of times from others replying. Of course its risky to put yourself out there and have your opinions public, but how much are you really hiding? If someone is absolutely rude and ignorant on Facebook, they probably are in real life too. Sometimes people will lose it over something small, and if you respect their triggers and are kind and understanding, then it's funny.  I think it's easy to let yourself become a bully if you're not careful. Triggers are real and I do my best to make sure everyone is comfortable, but if you're ""triggered"" because I dislike you're favorite movie then that's not triggered, you're just oversensitive and ignorant. I think you learn alot about social construct aswell. Its risk free enough that people go out of their social comfort zone and if it isnt taken well by others, the consequence is lesser than if it was people you have to go to school

All that anime stuff is borderline paedophilia. All the female characters are made to look like little girls. A lot of it is genuinely little girls not just implied. None of that shit would be allowed in western culture now,  the last time I remember genuine sexualisation of youth, it was Britney Spears in her video in a school uniform a long time ago. Anime has all the characters dressed like that. You think its cool?  In Japan the sexual harassment of minors is shocking. 

Then the food. You can mentally masturbate at me all you like about how fresh that sushi is, I will accept another man's penis in my mouth before I eat cold uncooked fish. It does not taste amazing.  Its at best bland. You want good seafood,  go to Italy its incredible, and more inportantly, cooked. 

Media wise, tell me an important band that came from Japan? There are none. J-Pop absolutely sucks..

frelra,Switchkillengaged,Games of chance involving real money should be banned for people under 18.,"I think children taking a gamble with real money for the hope of something should be illegal. This includes trading cards like Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and Sports cards. 

Most importantly I think that chance based video game rewards involving real money such as loot boxes should be band as well for people under age. They Define gambling as paying money to have a chance to win money, but it really should be defined as paying money to have a chance to win anything like in game currencies and items/skins/weapons. 

We should never hear on the news about a kid spending $30,000 on FIFA, that should not be possible. There should also be a cap to how much people can spend. Maybe per day or per month or whatever. There just needs to be more regulation as new technology creates new ideas. Like how they had to implement a law against texting and driving because of the rise of cell phones.

I really think they should be banned altogether for people under 18. Games of chance like card collecting may sound harmless and maybe that's not as bad as loot boxes but I still think it's regressive and needs to be fixed.

fref6y,TehTexasRanger,Poor people should only go to college for STEM,"Like I said in the title poor people should only go to college for STEM. Teachers don’t make shit. Maybe if you want to be a lawyer that’s an option too. But I know from experience that when I wasn’t able to major in STEM I should I’ve dropped out. That way I would not be in debt without a job. All my friends who majored in STEM have decent jobs and look down on poor people like me and don’t understand how people live the way we do.

They ask me how are we not able to afford to enter the stock market etc. then I have to explain to them we don’t have the money to drop $200 on stocks. If I was smarter I could’ve went STEM and I could have money myself now. People act like STEM degrees don’t matter but they really are one of the few options you have. Literally the only people I know who are non stem majors who have decent jobs are because of family connections. The rest of them work of grocery stores or some shit and are failures at life including myself.

So if someone tries to tell you STEM isn’t the way then they are full of shit. I have a friend right now who’s safe from the virus because he gets to work at home and still makes a fat paycheck while poor bastards have to work at a store and potentially get infected. So if you are poor you really should only take STEM majors to get out of poverty or you’ll  most likely end up working at Walmart the rest of your life.",18,1585519870,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fref6y/poor_people_should_only_go_to_college_for_stem/,unpopularopinion,0

free00,thedelisnack,TV shows that last more than one season are a risky and often unreliable medium for storytelling,"There are a ton of long-running shows that I would have watched years ago but didn’t because of their ridiculous runtimes. There are also a ton of shows that I dropped after watching several seasons because the focus was lost and the quality of the storytelling had nosedived into absolute delirium. 

Game of Thrones is the hot-button show to tout out right now as an example for mucking up the landing after years of impressive mid-air flips and tricks. But The Walking Dead and Supernatural also come to mind as shows that I continued to watch for far longer than I should have. Even BBC Sherlock couldn’t keep it’s act together for more than two seasons. And I’ve come to realize that TV shows that lean heavily on a cohesive narrative and likable characters more often than not overstay their welcome and aren’t worth the time put into watching them. 

Of course there are exceptions to the rule. Breaking Bad was terrific from start to finish. But in the grand scheme of the things, that’s certainly not what I’ve come to expect from most TV shows. 

I’d much rather end up watching a bad movie and lose two hours of my life than be dragged along by a below average TV show for months only to reach an exceptionally bad episode and drop it like a diseased appendage. 

If a show is more than one or two seasons, I’m not giving it the time of day anymore.",11,1585519756,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/free00/tv_shows_that_last_more_than_one_season_are_a/,unpopularopinion,0

fredc1,mest7162,A white person doing some kind of work in another country (read: lower income country) doesn’t always mean they are a “white savior”.,"Now before you accuse me of having this exact white savior complex, hear me out.

*Disclaimer: I genuinely mean no offense to people who think otherwise, or to people who are minorities or residents of said countries and feel affected by this issue.*

I am 100% acknowledging that the white savior complex is a real and very damaging thing. And I understand the frustration and anger that comes from seeing it happen. People use African or Indian or Cambodian, etc. poverty to get attention and social media likes, and that is fucked up. The people who live in developing countries are not part of a zoo. They are not a sideshow. If you’re there to genuinely do something, then it shouldn’t matter if the picture shows little brown kids holding your hands. I fully admit, I was guilty of this when I was younger. I had a picture of me playing soccer with children in an African country. I will say that it wasn’t for attention at all, but I did realize that it could come off that way so I reframed the post, and explained it in that context, how you have to be careful with things like that.

But to get to the main point of this, there shouldn’t be a blanket accusation on every white person that goes to other countries. I feel strongly about this because I am a public health professional and a LOT of public health work is international. If someone is a professional and has skills and qualifications then it should be okay for them to do their work where they want. Tackling global health issues does not make white people “saviors”. For example, I want to work with Tuberculosis in sub-saharan Africa, specifically South Africa which accounts for a major percentage of all TB cases in the world. Some people would look at that example and say *Oh mest7126, you’re delusional and have a white savior complex, you’re making it worse, it isn’t your job*. Except it is my job, I am a professional in the field, most public health jobs require a Master’s degree in terms of qualifications. And it has nothing to do with location. If Japan had the highest TB burden then I’d be there. If it was Brazil then I’d be there. If it was Spain then I’d be there. If it was Canada or the US then I’d be there. If you have a legitimate goal to help and do your work without it being related to “they’re poor and I’m not, I’m smart and they’re not” then there is nothing wrong with that. 

With the white savior logic, no one can work in Asian countries unless they are Asian. Same with Africa, Australia (indigenous), Europe, South America, North America (native american). My colleagues and I shouldn’t have to feel guilty for our careers and desires to help the world’s health as a WHOLE.

**TLDR: The term white savior gets applied too freely. There are people who completely embody that, but there are others who have legitimate reasons and qualifications, etc. and they shouldn’t be labelled as such.**",0,1585519688,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fredc1/a_white_person_doing_some_kind_of_work_in_another/,unpopularopinion,3

frebff,AManIsBusy,Online dating has taught me that we're all basically the same,"One unique thing about online dating is that it's one of the purest forms of selling yourself to the world. You're trying to tell everyone who you are and what sets you apart. In addition, you're a buyer in this marketplace too, so you're comparing everyone and trying to make the best selections.  
We all have these narratives in our head about how we're cool and unique, but the reality is that we react mostly the same way in given situations. The main thing that might differ from person to person is which situations they are thrown in.

For instance, someone is ""looking for a relationship"". If someone hot enough comes across their screen, they will not care about anything else (their personality, what they want, etc). They'll swipe and try to make it happen. Thus, making them just as shallow as they accuse the world of being.

I think we're all looking for basically the same thing. It's just a matter of whether they want to do that thing with you. Take a guy who sleeps around a lot. He might want a long-term relationship, but he's not willing to commit to the girls he sleeps with because they aren't up to par (and not because they're easy or anything like that).

In terms of personality traits, we all have complex mixes of everything, and again I think they come out by situation more than anything. Are you laidback or serious? Probably a mix of both. Are you introverted or extroverted? Same. Let's say you think of yourself as really stubborn, and this makes you unique. What percent of the population do you think is stubborn? Given a situation where they have to be stubborn, I'd guess quite a few people.

Hobbies-wise, we all do the same shit pretty much. We all consume media (TV, movies, music, video games). We all consume food and drink, exercise, and fuck. We all read and pursue personal advancement.

If all of this is sort of off limits for defining yourself  (with exceptions for rare people who display exceptional passion for something), then how do we even do such a thing? I think you have to give up the notion that you or anyone else is special.",5,1585519500,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frebff/online_dating_has_taught_me_that_were_all/,unpopularopinion,2

fre5mv,Shamwambler,"The ending of The Sopranos wasn't that ambiguous, it's pretty obvious what was implied. *major spoilers)"," 

Recently finished watching The Sopranos for the first time, definitely my favorite show ever made. While I was watching it I kept getting told the ending is super disappointing, doesn't explain anything, is a total blue balls, etc. I completely disagree and think they made it pretty obvious what happened. The creator of the show has said in an interview that there is a definitive conclusion to the show and that everything that you need to put it together is there.

I thought it was pretty clear that Tony gets shot at the end and the abrupt cut to black is the audience experiencing Tony's death from his point of view.

The Godfather scene where Fredo wacks the guy with a gun hidden in the restaurant bathroom is referred to as Tony's favorite movie scene. The guy in the baseball cap that keeps being shown at the end of the Sopranos clearly goes to the bathroom to grab a gun to kill Tony, as small connection to the Godfather scene.

Part of the reason the Sopranos is so interesting is because it tends to be a very grounded take on the mob. This theme culminates in Tony's death being portrayed as a soundless cut to black, rather than a glorious final shootout or dramatic final act where we see the emotional impact of Tony's death. In the final episodes, Tony has some conversations about death and he's told you don't hear the bullet that kills you, your death just sort of happens.

A lot of people say that nothing happened at the restaurant, it just ended suddenly because that was the end of the Sopranos story. I feel like if that were the case, the pitch black screen wouldn't have been held for so long. Can't really articulate it super well, but I just feel like if ""nothing happened"" was what they were going for, it would have just gone straight to credits. The full ten seconds of pitch black is kind of...a thing in and of itself? Like the black screen had to have been trying to portray SOMETHING or else it wouldn't have been drawn out for so long.

Additionally, it's a common thing in the sopranos to play wacky/out of place music during a gruesome death to give the violent death scenes a discomforting and chilling tone. This matches up perfectly with an uplifting song like Don't Stop Believing being played during the death scene of the main character.

Anyway, that's my hot take.",8,1585518928,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fre5mv/the_ending_of_the_sopranos_wasnt_that_ambiguous/,unpopularopinion,1

fre518,bormoni,Society should force men to temporarily transition and live as women for at least 1 year,"Ok, I know this idea might sound crazy, but hear me out. Patriarcky is a huge problem. Most of it is due to male privledge, which isn’t entirely their fault. When our swim in privledge it’s hard to notice it! So I have an idea to force men to check their privilege and thereby eliminate the patriarcky within a century!

You know how some countries force people to do a year in the military? 

Or the Amish youth have one year among the normals?

Or people spend a year abroad immersed in a new culture?

Society should force men to walk a mile in women’s’ shoes and essentially become women for a year. This is something I’m calling the Compulsory Feminine Education and Empathy Program (CFEEP for short, but the naming is flexible obvi) that should be mandated by the UN all over the world.


Say when a boy turns 18, he must go to a re-education center. Then he must have a female name, wear female clothes, have breast implants. Force them to take female hormones to influence their internal mindset (more estrogen = more feminine emotions and mindset) and extreme hypnosis.

After a six-month forced femininity boot camp, they are prepared to be released into the world as women, to live a year in female shoes experiencing sexsm and discrimination and also just the day to day bullshit women have to endure that men don’t.

After a year, they have the choice to become men again. If they do, they definitely won’t be chovinists. Hopefully though, they’ll choose to stay women for the rest of their lives. Either way, patriarkhy is gradually eroded through this extremely empathetic nonviolent method.

I, for one, would immediately volunteer to undergo the aforementioned re-education, because I am so committed to being an empathetic and understanding modern mxn.",19,1585518869,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fre518/society_should_force_men_to_temporarily/,unpopularopinion,0

We have created amazing machines for massive benefit. This has all come at the cost releasing greenhouse gasses in large quantities, cutting down forests at staggering rates and hunting other species to or near extinction. This sounds bad, and it is, however we are not killing the planet. Every species not currently alive has gone extinct and every-time there were new species more fit to survive on this Earth to replace them. Ever since the first life on Earth there has never not been life on Earth this will not change because of humans. In the future humans will be extinct, at some point every species on earth right now will be extinct, but they will all have been replaced by new life more evolved or of a different type.

frdtpw,OppositeExcuse2,The Karen meme is at worst sexsist and at best overused.,"Its was funny at first, I'll admit. But that was when the meme was contained to simply being about entitled older while women breaking a fit. Now, it seems as if the meme has been beaten over and appropriated to just dissmiss a woman just, like, existing (cue all the ok karen/ok boomer comments that will commence)

Like, the whole insulting an older woman just for her haircut is kinda weird and shitty. Is it a bad haircut? Yeah, 100%. Is it indicative of moral character? No! In fact, I'd wager that the reason this haircut is so popular is that a lot of moms want to feel feminine, but also want to cut their hair short for practicality and safety reasons - long hair can wrap around a babies limbs cutting off circulation. Hence, the Karen cut. They're just trying to be good moms.

Also, the whole making fun of Karens for arts and crafts and their ""live laugh love"" signs. I dont see the appeal, like at all, but why cant we let people like things? Its harming no one, let women have their macrame and cheesy tea cup sets. No one ever makes sun of the typical Kyle for his stupid hobbies like motorbikes or fishing.

Finally, because the whole Karen thing is ingrained in internet culture, and by extension reddit, Ive noticed that its starting to be used as a way to dismiss older women in general. Anytime a middle aged woman does something the internet even vaguely disagrees with, she gets hit with the ""ok Karen"". If she even tries to defend herself, she just falls further into the Karen stereotype. Which is hella wack.

Yes, racism/entitlement/being an asshole are all issues that should be addressed, and memes are a way of pointing that out. But the Karen meme really has gone way off into kinda targeting all women. I mean, most male caricatures rarely have the fame or negative reputation as the Karen. Theres the Chad, which is often used in a positive context. Theres the badluck brian, but its not explicitly negative. I guess scumbag steve would be the closest male equivalent? But even that seemed to have been done in honest jest, and at its height that meme was no where near as relevant to the Karen.

frdt10,fakeaccts1234,Men aren't going to open up to women just because they say they want guys to be vulnerable,"This is a pretty complicated thing.

No offense to women, but sometimes they just don't know the amount of emotional labor they generate. To put it bluntly, male emotional expression (especially in relationships), is largely not for the benefit of the man but for the woman. I know this sounds bad at first but bear with me here because I think it's an important point that people don't consider. 


As men we are told by society constantly that we have to act a certain way and meet all these standards to be lovable people. In relationships, all those expectations are turned up to 11. We have to be caring, but not smothering. Get angry at the right times and for the right reasons - anything else is toxic. Be someone's rock, but show that you're a person too. If you don't open up enough, you're emotionally stunted. Open up too much, and you're a basketcase. Show just the right level of affection - too much means you're insecure and too little means you're not invested. Expressing *unwanted* emotions to women gets you shamed. 


That's likely a lot of it. We're not only told but pressured by everyone to not let our anxiety until things have gone so wrong we can't take it anymore. For a lot of women it seems like a big shock when their husband or partner who they've been with for a while breaks down and has the same insecurities they do. They aren't assertive, they don't have all the answers or a plan, they aren't a rock, they're just as clueless as the rest of us. That confident, assertive, happy-go-lucky person you once fell in love with is gone. Many people say they want vulnerability with men but sometimes it happens so violently or so unexpectedly that it comes as a shock and *the woman ends up feeling unsupported*. That's more than enough to cause someone to back out of a relationship. It's only compounded when you take into account how males have been socialized for the provider role, so anything that threatens that ability to provide is often met with that feeling of lack of support. 


Another reason I think is important is that men and women tend to argue differently. This is anecdotal but in my life I've *never* seen a man try to emotionally hurt someone the way I've seen women. Whenever my ex gets angry, she's absolutely brutal. There's no limit, no sensible place to stop to keep the friendship. She'll go right on past ""fuck you"" to ""I hate you"" to ""I wish I'd never met you"". A lot of people when they get to that point let off really terrible stuff like saying someone never pleased them in bed, they can't believe their partner is such a loser to still live with their parents, or their partner is the worst-looking person they've ever met and couldn't possibly get anything better than them. I feel like a lot of the time women go for the jugular in an argument and try to cause as much emotional pain as possible, while men often substitute with anger and violence. Words hurt though, and once stuff like that has been said there's only so much you can do to backtrack it.


Most men have been through this situation or have seen someone who has. And frankly, there's a lot of women out there that openly express their proclivities towards tall, rich, or handsome men. I was in a bar recently and there was a group of women giggling as guys came out of the bathroom. They were rating them (in very poor whispers) and you could just sense the air of entitlement they felt. It didn't matter if you were a person with feelings to them - you were their entertainment. 


It only takes a handful of these experiences to make someone feel like women are only after them for superficial reasons, and not because someone wants to love them in return.",22,1585517680,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frdt10/men_arent_going_to_open_up_to_women_just_because/,unpopularopinion,14

American millionaires such as Benjamin Gugghenheim, John Jacob Astor and railway magnate Charles M. Hays as well as the cream of British society including the Countess of Rothes, the eminent journalist W.T. Stead. 

These leaders would go on to ensure that industry and government kept running smoothly which ultimately would give more poor working class people jobs and keep the economy stabilized. 

The third class consisted of from an economical standpoint, as unfortunate as it is, a largely replaceable set people. Mostly uneducated poor that worked menial jobs and did not do much in furthering the cause of the economy or humanity. 

While any loss of human life is sad, at the end of the day more lives were better off that the first and second class passengers were prioritized and our world was better for it.

**Yes I am cherry picking and being a bit of a prude.** I don't mind lyrics being a bit sexualized but this song seems like a bit much. This song is TOP 3, she is extremely popular with young teenage girls and the song is about going against your parents wishes to have sex with a ""badboy"" no strings attached and ""forgetting what your dad"" taught you.

**When the singer left her first group**, she mentioned she disliked being oversexualized. This song was basically written by 5 men and co-written by her.

I am personally a longer laster and my solo sessions last for 10 minutes but my sex sessions normally last for 15-30 minutes without ejaculating. This is the sweet spot but due to mental health reasons two years ago I got put on Lexapro which killed my sex drive. I went from having a solo sesh everyday to once every 3 days and the once every 3 days wasn't for pleasure purposes but was for maintenance and health reason. I believe that it is good to clear the pipes every few days to function mentally and physically. The problem was that sometimes it would take me up to 30 minutes to an hour to finish.

After a few weeks when the medication started working I soon discovered that I lasted a shitload longer in bed as well. I thought this was a good thing at first and was psyched about it. I could last upwards of an hour, my record standing to this date is two. The issue I have found is that women don't enjoy sex after around the 20 minute mark. Every chick is different but I have found that after they finish a few times they get bored and it has been a blow to their self-worth and self esteem as well. I have had women get upset because it took me so long to finish. I have also found that the stigma behind being sexually selfish is not limited to men. Having sex for longer than 20 minutes is exhausting. I have had sexual partners stop and say that they don't want to continue because I take to long after I have made them climax.

I am now off Lexapro and am back to normal and am grateful of the amount of time I take but at the same time I kind of wish I was quicker. I am not a selfish lover and when I finish I continue till the person I am with is satisfied. If you are reading this and you finish quick I want to let you know that that doesn't matter and is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about. Chicks will probably see it as a complement and if you finish quickly there are other ways to get a woman to where she would like to be. As long as you are patient and are not selfish everyone can win in this transaction.

Also this might get me downvoted into oblivion but for those who are quick I just wanted to share a tutorial vid that has helped me heaps. Obviously NSFW [https://www.pornhub.com/view\_video.php?viewkey=ph5712f4fcadf9c](https://www.pornhub.com/view_video.php?viewkey=ph5712f4fcadf9c) here is a tutorial on how to preform cunilingus.

frd917,askmenextyearifimok,I think Avatar (2009) is one of the most jaw-dropping beautiful and enjoyable films ever,"I am pretty certain this is an unpopular opinion because in spite of it being the highest grossing film of all time (until last year)... it seems to get a great deal of flak. Critics love to hate it. So many people will repeat things about how unoriginal the storyline is (blue Pocahontas Smurfs n all that). You’ve even got the argument that it is telling a white-people saviour story through the means of the human species (specifically Jake Sully) being ‘the one’ to help another kind of human (the na’vi being humanoids). Also the fact it doesn’t have a ‘cult’ fan following like Star Wars did seems to mean it isn’t as good. Also the fact it got so many less oscars..

While these arguments hold some merit... they don’t outweigh that, in my opinion, Avatar is of the most transcendent film experiences I have ever had for the following reasons:

I remember the first time I watched it; at 17 years old with a ton of typical teenager problems and angst, and simply forgetting *everything* I cared about. It was as if I stepped into the avatar body of Jakes na’vi and I was complete and utterly mesmerised. I fell in love with Pandora and all the creatures in it. I was completely invested in the story. I couldn’t believe what I was watching... I felt immense gratefulness to live in a time where this unparalleled universe could be witnessed. The 3D experience was also out of this world- something that has been a gimmick for so many films since avatar mostly because they set the bar way so high... The CGI is still amazing.. even to this day so many films don’t come even slightly close to achieving the level of detail with every shot being so captivating. If you’ve experienced ‘the flight of passage’ in Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Florida you’ll hopefully concur that it is the most insanely amazing rides in the world. 

I cannot describe how excited I am for Avatar 2.. and the fact that James Cameron has been working on it for this long makes me all the more thrilled for the future of Pandora.

frd767,i_swoosh_to_goosh_,The term “simp” is toxic and immature,"I usually enjoy and understand a lot of memes/internet humor, but I really dislike the term simp. At it’s core definition (urban dic defines it as “A man that puts too much value on a female for no reason”) it’s not that bad, just poking fun at people embarrassing themselves which is not too harmful in a lot of cases. But what I do have a problem with is how the term has evolved as a way to shame boys/men for treating women with respect and care. 

I think this problem is highlighted with the idubbz controversy, with all these (primarily) young men calling him a simp for being ok with his girlfriend being on onlyfans. I get that most of the people doing that are joking, but I still think it’s immature to shame him for making an adult decision that I’m sure was discussed between the two of them at length.  

I think that everyone should do their best to treat people around them with love and care regardless of gender and the term simp is often used in a harmful manner that makes men feel lame for doing/trying to do something kind.",57,1585515563,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frd767/the_term_simp_is_toxic_and_immature/,unpopularopinion,8

frd69n,Millie7798,You shouldn't be allowed to use the term Toxic,"I personally believe the word ""Toxic"" was fabricated by the internet to manipulate people into thinking something is bad. Your boyfriend won't let you go out? That's toxic. Your parents give you too many boundaries? That's toxic. Whatever... I don't care the reason people say it, my point is, its not a real word with a finite definition. Meaning you can't really fine-tune the word.

Secondly, even if the term Toxic was a real medical term... WHICH IT IS NOT... You are not qualified to use it. Just because you're an entitled internet troll who thinks - because they're the wisest person ever who's been through every relationship problem - they can just parade around this term to seem smart. 

Baseline, though, the word does not even help anybody. Just throwing a label like ""Toxicity"" on some problem does not solve anything. If someone is asking for help, they know something is wrong, what they want now is how to help it, or not help it at all, maybe they just want someone to care about their situation. 

So please, for the love of god, stop using the word toxic, because you aren't smarter for it, you're just a mindless conformist.",21,1585515475,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frd69n/you_shouldnt_be_allowed_to_use_the_term_toxic/,unpopularopinion,0

If I'm taking anything positive away from this worldwide epidemic, it's that we need to stop putting things off to the next year and blaming our shortcomings on the current year. It's not the years fault that you didn't keep going to the gym after January, or that you didn't get your dream car, or you didn't find the perfect partner. We need to stop blaming our shortcomings on the year, A MEASUREMENT OF TIME. 


We need to forget about all the superstitions we have where we think our lives are suddenly going to turn around and we'll go from broke to ballin', just because a specific year or a higher being decided it was our year.


We don't need superstition, or gut feeling. Sure it makes us feel better about ourselves, but that's worthless in the long term. If you want to better yourself, you have the power to do that. Sure next year, or the year after, but you do today. 


I hate to sound cliche, ""tomorrow is never for certain"", but it's true. Nobody expected to go into 2020 knowing that in a couple months time we'd all be stuck inside, elderly, young and family and friends kept apart, people sick and dying. 


Had you known that this was going to happen, you probably would've gotten everything done before. If you're one of those people who feel like they never seem to get anywhere in life because it ""wasn't my year"", for things you can do while stuck inside, do it. Research that idea that could make you millions, start that dog grooming company you've dreamed of owning, get that driving license theory learned, learn that language you wanted to learn, get the body you want. Now is as good a time as ever, but have the mindset going forward that if you really want to do something, you have the power to do it whenever you want.

However, the reason behind their love of something or their distaste of something does. My sister for example doesnt like David Lynch movie or Nirvana, thats fine but the reason she hates those things speaks to the kind of person that she is. She doesn't like it when the media she watches is ambigous or vague. She doesnt like how she cant understand what Kurt Cobain is saying or she doesn't like the surreal inagery in Eraserhead because it doesn't immediately connect to the plot. That reflects in her personality as she doesnt really like being challenged by things. Thats nkt really a good or bad thing rather than just her way of thinking, which is alright.

I on the other hand, love david lynch and Nirvana because I like it when I see things/hear things that I nornally wouldn't. Thats not just in movies either, I get really excited when something creepy or strange happens in my actual life. I love getting paralysis attacks because even if Im scared in the moment, im suoer grateful the attack actually happened because I saw something that defied my understanding of reality. I bring this up because I can see this part of myself in the media I consume which is often weird and unusual.

frcv04,Acid_cheeseflav,"""If you can't handle me at my best, you don't deserve me at my worst"" Is a quote that lots of toxic people use. People who struggle with accountability.","I understand how this could be valid. However, I've noticed a large majority of toxic people saying this. There is also another quote. This person talks about what it's like to date them. They state that they are damaged. Triggered easily. That they'll shut their partner out. That everyone else cheated, lied, or left. 

I understand how that can also be valid. It can however, also be a red flag. I understand being damaged. I understand trust issues. I understand struggling with shutting people out. However, it becomes a problem when this is used as an excuse not to work on yourself. You can't expect a relationship to survive, without actually putting effort into resolving your own issues. You can't continually push people away, then expect them to give one hundred percent. Yes, it takes time to open up. It takes time to heal from triggers. But after a certain amount of time has passed, and the person doesn't actively try to overcome these things: People will get tired. 

These two quotes resonated with me. They remind me of people in my life who have refused to change. The same people who say ""I am just the way I am. I'm not changing for anyone. Take it or leave it."" Those same people, who use trauma as an excuse to never progress. To stay emotionally stagnant in their maturity. To regress into stubborn ways.

frcsgm,PapiChuloxx,Men and Women Aren't Held to the Same Standards of Consent,"As men, we are constantly beat over the head with the fact that we must ask for consent to do pretty much anything sexual with women. These days you can't so much as touch a women without consent lest someone accuses you of sexual harassment on the spot. Ok fine, fair enough, I agree while it has gone a bit overboard these days, consent is an inherently important thing. The problem is that women are not held to nearly the same strict standards when it comes to them initiating contact with men.

It seems the same people who screech the loudest about how men objectify and abuse women and how we all feel ""entitled"" to women's bodies are typically the same people who feel that men owe them sex and attention whenever they want it and should be honored that a women even noticed their existence. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a club or a bar and some random women I showed now interest in and had no sexual attraction to tried to feel me up, kiss me, grind on me etc. Not one asked for my consent prior to doing any of these things. My friend who is more attractive than me has this happen to him all the time whenever he goes out with anyone. If it were men exhibiting behavior like this, their ass would be kicked to the curb and they'd probably be arrested. But because it's women they get to do whatever they want with men and we're expected to just sit back and enjoy it because we're expected to be a bunch of sex crazed emotionless robots so we must like everything a woman does to us.

You can see this in the double standard in how we treat people who engage with minors in a sexual relationship. A man who has sex with a younger girl is a monster and a rapist but a woman who has sex with a younger boy gets a slap on the wrist because they boy probably ""wanted it"" or ""enjoyed it"" and that he's ""lucky"" that he was able to get with an older woman. It really boggles the mind. If underage girls can't consent then underage boys can't either but the penalty for both is not the same at all. If we want true equality, we need to stop giving people passes because of their gender and actually be consistent in our beliefs.",114,1585514114,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frcsgm/men_and_women_arent_held_to_the_same_standards_of/,unpopularopinion,20

frcozx,ScandinavianAtheist,The Italian Mafia is significantly more honorable and trustworthy than the Police Force.,"Let me just start this by saying there is absolutely nothing wrong with romanticizing the Mafia. Especially since they're mostly in the fictional sense such as the Godfather or Goodfellas. They just happen to be people in this world who decide to make money and make connections the best way they know how. I really don't see how it's any different than romanticizing Western Outlaws or the old Pirates who sailed the Seven Seas. Even though outlaw cowboys and pirates happened to murder many people and commit unspeakable acts of violence, they happen to be romanticized by little kids who play with action figures and hollywood in the movies. What makes the Mafia any different? 

But they do heinous things and ruin people's lives with violence, you say? 

Well, there already is a organization comprised of armed gang members that harasses people (usually unlawfully) and ruins their lives. It's called the police force.

Honestly, I have no idea why the Mafia gets the label of ""Untrustworthy criminal lowlifes"" when the police commit way worse acts in this day and age than the Mafia did when it was at its prime. There are many dead black Americans who will attest to that fact. Among them, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and Tamir Rice who happened to be a 9 year old boy who was shot by police for waving a toy gun. It's kind of pathetic that, as a culture, we look at these neighborhood monsters as if they're supposed to be ""heroes."" Heroes for doing what exactly? Committing violence against the people they're supposed to protect? The cop who arrested a guy for a DUI charge, making him lose his license, job and kids, pushing him towards committing suicide is supposed to be a ""hero""? If the Mafia is considered to be subhuman ""because of the amounts of lives they ruin with their violence"" then what the fuck would you call the police? They have been doing 10x the amount of despair to human beings that the Mafia ever has and they get praised for it!

At least the Mafia has values of honor and fighting to the death to protect your own family while the police are only in it to satisfy their own egos and are only in it for themselves. In my personal opinion, so-called ""criminals"" are so much more trustworthy and honest than the armed terrorists in the police force that wouldn't think twice about not ruining your life if it meant he was getting paid and who think they deserve respect just because they wear a fucking uniform.",45,1585513781,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frcozx/the_italian_mafia_is_significantly_more_honorable/,unpopularopinion,0

Unfortunately for them, their laziness and/or lack of ambition has made it impossible for them to contribute as they normally spend all of their time in home. Now they can finally make a contribution, even if it is superficial, by doing what they do on a regular basis.

No more systematic meat production, no more farms and pets. I do think that the natural way of carnivores hunting for food when it's necessary is morally right, though. I wished that the world was built to accommodate both animals and humans, as in no cars. I wish that we didn't have pets, but that they instead lived in the wild. I don't believe that humans should have any control whatsoever over animals just because they're not as intelligent: I don't believe that's a valid argument, because that is merely an excuse that we use because it benefits us, and not a reason. Why should it ever be okay to exploit, abuse and objectify anyone based off their intelligence? I know that this would complicate things a lot given how the world looks today, and I know that any of this won't happen (in the near future at least), but this is just an opinion that I have, and I have never heard of anyone with the same dream.

frbwdb,SuPr_Change,I don't like Hykuu (it's an anime but still),"Everyone that watches anime that I know loves this series but I don't get it, its literally just a normal everyday series of events of a volleyball player. And I get it, not all people want to watch over the top things like HxH, FMA, or JoJo but that's the whole point in anime, to watch cool shit that won't happen IRL. One of my friends put together a list of why Hykuu is great, so I will share my retorts to it.

*characters (they don't just use them, they have their own lives and backstories and character flaws and they're not perfect and need to train to get better instead of inhaling a magic peanut)*

*story (it makes you get interested seeing how  they're gonna overcome problems and there are intense matches that are fairly realistic and gets way better through the seasons )*

*animation (the animation is super pretty and nice and the music is great too. Alsmot every detail is apparent and it's amazing)*

**And my response:**

*Characters: I get that they all have a backstory, but I already have to suffer through people in real life and I don't need to ""care"" about anyone else*

*Story: again so does every other anime and intense matches that are realistic? Should I not just watch real volleyball?*

*Animation: the only anime with shit animation is pokemon (and some others). and yet that is still a great tv series, meaning animation has almost nothing to do with how good an anime is*

I think that the anime just has a lot of male characters playing volleyball and basically making the fanbase go crazy because they are really laying it on thick that ""Ha HA gay anime characters, fanfic"" and don't get me wrong I don't mind gay characters in anime but damn.

Ketchup, and the whole tomato flavor, has too much similarity to the eggy flavor we all know and love (umami, i think it’s called). Mustard, on the other hand, provides a delicious and refreshing contrast to the egg and delivers the bitter and tangy/curvy taste to the dish, sobering me and giving the eggs depth.

* The kids were **never**, ever overweight. A lot of them were in soccer and hockey teams (I live in Canada)
* A lot of their parents were volunteers at the elementary school, like working at the library or helping teachers during art classes
* The kids **occasionally** played video games. I remember a kid who had straight As in fifth grade - who invited me at his birthday party. He had over 30 GameCube games in his TV set. He was not a troublemaker and didn't have poor grades. Another proof that destroying a kid's console is fucking dumb.

frbhrd,PleasureToNietzsche,"“Looks” themselves do not make a person’s life easier. Being good looking requires a certain amount of discipline, and disciplined people are generally more effective, and therefore more likely to be successful. The looks are not the cause, but rather a visual indicator of one’s ability.","Ugly and fat people are not going to want to hear this, but good looking, fit people do not simply have easier lives like you all like to think. Being attractive does not just make wealth and opportunity and partners rain down from the sky. 

You have not been exiled from these things by the world simply because you are fat or unattractive. being ugly and overweight are visual indicators of how disciplined you are about your health and body, and can be extrapolated and used as an indicator for how disciplined you are in your daily life. 

People are drawn to high value, smart, disciplined individuals. If someone can’t go through the trouble to be healthy and take some time to show that they can take care of themselves, don’t be surprised when you aren’t held in the same regard as someone who does. Being overweight demonstrates a clear disregard for your own health and implies a certain level of laziness, something most don’t people want in a partner. 

So the next time you want to be mad at the world for not giving your fat, ugly ass the same opportunity as everyone else, remember that this perception of your values and discipline are what’s turning people away,  not the appearance itself. Work on being confident and smart and being a good decision maker and people will forgo looks if you meet the rest of these requirements",6,1585509655,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frbhrd/looks_themselves_do_not_make_a_persons_life/,unpopularopinion,5

Going through this period has really opened my eyes to what dead bedroom and sexual frustration can do to someone. I can’t imagine the pain of enduring this for years. I love the big D, love it love it love it, but I am prevented from going for it because of what’s happening. The unfulfilled need is real.

When I reflect on my judgmental attitude towards infidelity, and the many married guys I’ve blasted without even listening to their side of the story, I now feel I may have unfairly dismissed them when I should have shown a little more compassion. I’m not saying infidelity is the answer, I still don’t think it is. Hey, I’m not out there sucking rando dicks just because I’m super thirsty. No. 

What I’m saying is we need to show a little more compassion, a little more understanding. If married people are looking elsewhere for sexual gratification, there might be a very legitimate reason for their distress. Infidelity may not be the right solution, but lets not lose compassion for others just because they might be looking for a solution in the wrong places. Help them.

After listening to it I was left disappointed and confused about why people are calling it great.

The problems I have with this album are the same problems I have with other 'Great"" pop albums like 1989 or 25. They are big albums by well-known pop stars whose production companies are trying to profit off of growing trends, or try and make new sounds that sound revolutionary but are just reused trends from the past. Albums like this have no personality and are just the artist singing over manufactured dance/piano tracks. They leave no room for the artists to grow which leads to albums like Reputation or Adele taking a hiatus to happen.

frb18u,peppermintsandrhinos,People who have no sex drive should only date people with no sex drive.,"This was removed because I used the A-word that described someone w no sex drive. So I’ve replaced it with “people with no sex drive.”

One of my first relationships when I was young and dumb was with a friend turned girlfriend who I found out had no sex drive. I thought it wouldn’t be a big deal because I really liked her, we had a lot in common, she was hot, and she was a great person. That quickly changed. 

They never initiate. Even if they have sex with you they are doing it to please you which is exactly what my relationship with this girl was like. She only had sex to please me. Knowing someone wasn’t into it as I was really killed having sex for me. I literally felt dirty afterwards even if she made attempts to signal she was present (moaning) knowing she wouldn’t choose to be fucking if she had her choice. 

Thank god I only stayed in that relationship for just over a year (we had sex like 12 times, so once a month) because after I left it I basically fucked everything that moved and realized that amazing sex where both people are fucking animals, wanting to please each other, is one of the most enjoyable experiences in life. 

That ex and I are still friends, but that’s basically what our relationship was possible of becoming. Sex is important for a lot of people, and nothing kills a relationship like extreme differences in sex drive. I don’t know anyone w/ a sex drive successfully dating/marrying someone with little to no sex drive.",51,1585508079,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frb18u/people_who_have_no_sex_drive_should_only_date/,unpopularopinion,6

frax0b,wathejyu,All GTA games are overrated. And definitely don't deserve to be GOTY.,"First let me explain what is a good game for me. I find lineup games are better than open world ones, a good story is the most important thing to me, I don't play online games unless if they force you to play as a team like overcooked and it has to be different each time like uncharted games does, first shooting, parkour and puzzle solving.

Now I'm gonna talk about why I don't like GTA. It's boring there is only few different things you can do steal car - drive the car - police are here - shoot at them - escape or die. I know like all the open world games GTA has the side quests and main quest too but GTA's side and main quests are terrible. In main story it only shows you 3 guys trying to rob a bank there is no good storyline or emotion.

Empty open world. Yes it's big but it has nothing inside in it. I mean in LoZ:BotW yes there is a empty space too but in every corner there is a side quest. In GTA that emptiness covered only with cars.

Gunplay is terrible. It's just bad it doesn't feel right and also running is a bitch. I'm a Playstation user so I have to dash the x button to move fast.

This is my opinion about GTA. I think it's one of the worst games I've ever played. Maybe it's because I don't like playing as a gangster but in sure there is a lot of great game that shadowed because of any GTA game.",20,1585507660,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frax0b/all_gta_games_are_overrated_and_definitely_dont/,unpopularopinion,0

Users - the users are polarized into two groups: OffendERS and OffendEEs. Otherwise known as trolls and whiners - all just to provoke a desired reaction and/or increase ""karma""

Karma - what you get rewarded with for sharing popular ideas/opinions. The problem is, those who pander to it are rewarded with points for being inauthentic. It's the pop music of online opinions. Be real. Risk getting banned - LIVE ON THE EDGE a little!!!

Mods - Rule nazis. Yes, I understand things need to stay on topic or whatever, but so many users get banned or silenced for voicing well thought-out statements to topics or for responding in like to provocative posts or comments.  You know who you are.  Power corrupts, and fake internet power is like CRACK, YOU FREAKING POWER-HUNGRY CRAZIES!!!

Subreddits - Aren't they wonderful? I mean, there's a sub for just about everything. However, as a whole, the system is TOTAL CHAOS. As someone stated recently, all rules across all of them are different. Some will perma-ban users for the absolute dumbest sh*t. 

TLDR: All in all, Reddit, being not only the front page, but also the heart and soul of the internet, is exactly what's wrong with the world and human nature, only in a higher-concentrated form.

fraiu3,revere2323,I feel bad for Carol Baskin,"Spoilers Ahead if you haven’t watched Tiger King, although the memes are saturating the world so not sure if it matters.

From the documentary, Tiger King, I feel kinda bad for Carol Baskin. Do I think she is a totally normal human being? No. But did I go to elementary and high school with girls who were equally as weird? Yes.

While everyone just assumes she killed her husband, what if she didn’t? And now she has to constantly fight back these ridiculous rumors that she fed him to the tigers. That has to be really tough.

And people bash on her for having volunteers. Honestly, I think that’s the most ethical way to have help in this case. She can have hundreds of people and they 100% choose if they want to participate each day; most of the people there looked like housewives who probably just want a hobby. If people want to spend their time working to feed cats, that is their prerogative.

I do believe that she truly wanted to help. Yes she had a shady start, but it’s clear any disagreements with her first husband were about breeding. And people say her cats are still in cages—well, okay. But where else are these rescued cats supposed to go? Otherwise they are clearly just shot.

People have attacked her husband and his “weirdness.” Honestly, while weird, it was clear that they really loved each other. I don’t think he was “power hungry,” I think he was pissed that his wife was attacked so much. Who cares if they have a wedding pic on him on a leash. Half this country eats ass, so we are really going to bash them for that?

Carol was literally attacked constantly by Joe. He made incessant videos and attacks against her. He shot up mannequins of her and lit replicas of her on fire. The whole “she killed her husband” was made popular by Joe. Not shit she wants him in prison.

Yes, she’s totally whacko. But I also believe that it was in Netflix’s interest to edit and make her seem as weird as possible. 

I guess I just feel bad if this woman really just does want to end big cat breeding and her husband did just want to restart his life in Costa Rica. Now she has to be hated by all of America.",7,1585506268,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fraiu3/i_feel_bad_for_carol_baskin/,unpopularopinion,0

frahs0,juanitooooooo,Vinyl records don’t sound any better than digital recordings,"It seems like everyone these days is getting into vinyl because it’s “the thing to do” and “music just sounds better on vinyl” when most of those people own a newer record player that has all the technology any sort of competent Bluetooth speaker has. Even if you’re listening to vinyl on an old record player, you’re objectively listening to a worse product, if you were just to plug in some headphones and listen to the music on your phone or computer you’d get a cleaner sound and you’d be able to listen to all the elements the artists intended for the consumer to hear. As well as sounding the same, vinyl is just extremely inconvenient to use. You listen to a few songs and you have to flip the record and place the needle perfectly on the first song and then play. Rather than having to get up kid listen, just play a whole album on your phone and the inconvenience is gone.

Collecting vinyl is a different story, let people collect, I personally like collecting vinyl as it fits my rooms decor (since I’m an avid music fan) and it’s neat to have physical representations of the music you love. But I hate this trend of people getting vinyls and record players because it’s “in” and that “music should only be listened to on vinyl” when all they buy are pop records (no disrespect against pop music, but that music sounds the same whether you’re listening to it on a CD, vinyl, or Bluetooth speaker).",28,1585506155,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/frahs0/vinyl_records_dont_sound_any_better_than_digital/,unpopularopinion,3

fraaze,chemkay,"Impossible Burger ""meat"" is overhyped and disgusting","I recently have been incorporating a whole-food, plant-based diet. Don't get me wrong, I love meat, but it just isn't compatible with my gut. So, since going plant-based I've tried 2 packages of the Impossible Burger. The first thing I made was a plain old hamburger. It wasn't that bad for a meat imitation but I don't think it tastes like meat - maybe to a vegan that hasn't had meat in a while but for someone who eats meat on practically a daily basis, it just tastes like burnt rubber. But I gave it another chance. 

The second time I cooked with Impossible Burger was earlier today. I made a skillet lasagna. First thing I noticed when browning the ""meat"" in the skillet was an OVERWHELMING smell of dog shit that filled my entire apartment, the hallway leading to my apartment, and even the elevator lobby. The appeal for me is gone. Now I'm fully aware of the negative aspects of eating meat and I totally get why people go vegetarian/vegan/plant-based, but I don't think incorporating a foul-smelling and tasting meat alternative is the way to go if you're looking for that bloody fix. 

My conclusion: I think the brand is completely overhyped and there is this general idea floating around that this can be mistaken for meat. I think that idea is completely false. Impossible Burger is very smelly, it has a weird taste to it - almost like licking a 9V battery, the science behind it is questionable (ie. the whole estrogen thing), and not to mention its extremely high price point.

fra5xe,-uncommon-,Fear is a major factor of success,"Fear is what motivates you to achieve your goals and it pushes you to work harder than before. Fear provokes the worst case of what could occur causing you to be inspired to grind hard and prevent that from occurring. 

For instance, if I had a fear of being embarrassed (failure), then you bet that I would be working hard everyday and studying my butt of to ensure that I do not screw up my exam and get ridiculed by others. It creates a drive to succeed despite everything and ignites the flame inside you because you are afraid of what could possibly happen (fear). 

The problem occurs when people dont have the fear that is needed. Let's say that there is a major project due in 3 days, if you dont have the fear of struggling at the last minute and not turning it in on time, then you will probably put it off until the last minute until the fear and panic finally hit you. 

Some people say that fear causes you to make bad decisions and crash under pressure, but I think that the slight amount of stress that fear adds is the main reason behind why people become successful (get the drive for working hard)",2,1585505000,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/fra5xe/fear_is_a_major_factor_of_success/,unpopularopinion,1

People should just go about their lives and avoid contact with people who are really sick. We should quarantine only the most vulnerable and continue to let society tick along. They are doing similar things in the Netherlands and Iceland and it seems to be successful so far.

I know it seems incentive and of course I don’t want people to die, and I don’t want people to get sick.
