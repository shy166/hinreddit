fsoej5,Boredom_Zink,Suggestion: There should be an option to randomize player Icons whenever we login.,"I just thought of this randomly today, but I really don't have a favorite Icon. And I have a lot of them. Like, a lot a lot. It would be cool to see a different one assigned at random whenever I played. 

I know I can already just manually do it whenever I login, but the randomizing is just really appealing to me. Plus it would be cool to see ones that I wouldn't normally pick. Not sure all it would take to implement a feature like that, but it'd be a neat addition if Riot put it in.

Riven - Winrate across all elos - 47.67%. Winrate in Master. 50.46%

Here, Riven players, have 5 extra base health and 1.5 extra health regen.

Here Nasus, you get 100 increased range on your core CC ability, and a extra 10% armor pen.

Seems fair.

fsoajz,IvvyX,League of legends coaches are not doing a good job in most regions.,"So, right now I hate to bash on most coaches and I know their job isn't solely based on understanding champion data but in this time I've learned a lot about coaching in league and having an understanding of a champions full kit. I'm going to be using a few examples to prove my theory and I want to state that I'm not trying to bash coaches or analysts but there seems to be a few problems with thinking right now that most regions(Outside of mainly the LEC) have shown. 

The first issue I've seen is, the fact that some champions don't see play time because of their ""role"" because they don't ""fit"" competitive. Some champions are so insanely strong they require the enemy team to do certain things that will allow you to get free advantages just from picking those champions. My 2 biggest points are Malz and Qiyana these are champions that got picked in pro play because they made they whole enemy have to do something they didn't want to do just because those champions were picked. Qiyana forced people to have to play safe for almost the entire early game Qiyana was able to do something most assassins could not. Clear the whole wave extremely fast without big cooldown commitment and force roams. You had to play safe at all times if she went MIA even to back as we've seen early Qiyana's pick up mobi's and go straight for a gank. Malz is obvious he required people to pick QSS asap and delaying their other choices and even forced mages and supports who don't have a build path to buy it. 

Now why bring this up? It's because right now in league coaches are doing a pretty awful job outside of scouting the champions right now. Talon is basically Qiyana but lacks the CC she brought but arguably is more bursty post 6 and has more mobility on roams. Morde is arguably as insane as Malz if not more. His ult requires QSS or you get taken out of a fight for a long period of time drafts should be created around more champions like this. We don't see it enough. Is there counters to these? Yes, that's where you make the other coach have to make a tough choice and pick those counters and put his players on different champions. We've seen time and time again breaking the meta and creating your own meta is the best way to play league at a high level everytime an underdog wins it's due to creating new ways to win and win cons new strats etc. Right now comp league coaching is at one of the worst I've ever seen it, people just line up and play the meta and that's all they can do, they don't create counters they don't adjust to the picks they just play meta vs meta and whoever plays meta the better way wins. How do you think some of the best coaches in the NBA, NFL, ETC win superbowls most players in league are close enough thjat if you have the right coaching and strats you'll see it pay off. While I agree we don't have a lot of time to adjust to learning new strats on a week to week basis I can't say it takes more than a day or 2 to practice and try out new strats to prep for things like LCS/LCK/LPL etc. 

A person in another post made maybe one of the most stupid yet smart ideas I've ever seen. Picking Nasus support into Kalista adc. Now am I saying this is the god pick ? No, not at all but is this a legit pick into Kalista that makes her life hell and almost removes her insane kiting down and delays her build by 1250 gold? Yes, I don't think it'll work because Nasus would need to find a way to stay useful after the adc gets a qss BUT there are interesting things like that, that coaches can do to create new ideas and try new things on the big stage and honestly create new metas. I mean we've seen lesser regions with less talent taking games off big teams time and time again and it's all due to strats. 

When C9 first came into the league and took NA by storm it wasn't because they had god tier talent it was because they were far and ahead of creating new picks while still being able to understand and play the meta if given to them. I remember balls Rumble having to be banned almost every game despite it not being a meta pick early on. I remember Kennen mid before anyone else. Like it's time to stop making excuses NA coaches, get creative.",0,1585698594,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsoajz/league_of_legends_coaches_are_not_doing_a_good/,leagueoflegends,0

fso98n,New_Welcome,"Maokai's new ultimate is a design disaster, he deserves his old one back","[clip of new ult](https://youtu.be/G4TQEpXNUMU?t=143),  [if you want to learn what his new ult does](https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/ability/natures-grasp-819)

[clip of old ult](https://youtu.be/-2m1Ny6XzMQ?t=264), [if you want to learn what his old ultimate did](https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/ability/vengeful-maelstrom-358)

If you want evidence that his old ultimate wasn't broken or even dominant go to ""Maokai's old ultimate""

**Maokai's new ultimate**

During the 2017 tank rework, 3 tanks got their ultimate changed [(link)](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017). And the reason was ''carving out unique identities for them among the teamfight initiation crowd'. Zac and Sejunai were already designed for teamfight initiation with their ultimate picks so this makes sense. Maokai's wasn't however and he got changed from having a weak sustain ultimate to this crappy cc tool. And also his new ultimate doesn't act as a teamfight initiator as how slow it is anyone can walk to the side off it except in good flanks which is rare.

Maokai was supposed to be a low cc high sustain champion. Champions that are like this are rare, and to see one of them dissipate into another bonkers tank champion with ridiculous flashy spells rather than pure survival and tankiness annoys me. The only one left in this low cc high sustain class is probably Mundo.

It also goes against Maokai's lore of him holding a grudge against mage like cc spells. It got changed from 'Vengeful Maelstrom' to 'Natures Grasp', his new ability sounds and looks like something out of Zyra's pocket, it's so out of place for a tank or even character to have which is more on the next point.

Maokai's new ultimate is designed badly too. In a teamfight it's not threatening until it's used, it just feels like a nuisance you have to walk around that took no skill to use. Or realistically you just absorb and are unable to move for 3/4 of the teamfight but still can attack. And then there's that when he uses it and you stand perpendicular and you get a 0.8 sec root which you couldn't dodge. It's like his ultimate is too good in teamfights (too good, but horrible to play against), and in return it's weak anywhere else in the game which makes it 'balanced'.

&amp;#x200B;

**Maokai's old ultimate**

Maokai was very prominent pre 2017 competitive play and the reason is because there simply wasn't as many options as we have now. Because he was everywhere back in the day people come to the conclusion that he was this unstoppable force that couldn't be balanced in competitive and soloQ and he needed to come to an end. Look at the statistics and see how strong he really was. 

[https://lol.gamepedia.com/Maokai/Statistics/2016](https://lol.gamepedia.com/Maokai/Statistics/2016)

Tournaments included: LPL LCS LCK NA Worlds

2016 - 49.6% win rate

2017 - 51.5% win rate

2018 - **46.5**% win rate (After his ultimate change)

2019 - **0**% win rate (4 games played)

So no, Maokai's old ultimate was never broken no matter what people or your memory tells you. Further proof of this is when he was only played in competitive he wasn't nerfed hardly because people knew he wasn't that oppressive of a champion. His ultimate was changed on May 3 2017. His last ultimate nerf was August 31 2015. That's nearly 2 years of no changes which shows you can't class him as a balance issue.",8,1585698463,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fso98n/maokais_new_ultimate_is_a_design_disaster_he/,leagueoflegends,0

When Exalted, basic attacks reduce Radiant Smite cooldown by 1 second.

E : Celestial Blessing
Gain max stacks and becomes Exalted.
 
W: Under Oath

Swords conjured around Kayle gain the added effects of Radiant Smite and Under Oath.

""These are just changes I would make to Kayle, I think there was not much thought was put into her kit or it was wasted.

The reduction of the number of her forms i think its for the better, its the only reason why I think she doesn't get skins. Her base form should be her lvl 16 form with an Exalted effect animation. Kayle's melee form, its existence is just a nerf, its doesn't do anything in her current kit. Just make her ranged so we can enjoy a Morgana and Kayle bot lane without inting and cs.

fso0so,OxStronghammer,LCS Most Valuable Player,"It's Most Valuable Player.

If it's not Ssumday you're hard trolling (It subjective, and you have your reasons, the hard trolling is exaggerated but still)

Where are 100T if he didn't have one of the more dominant/stable spilts while there was issues with jg-sup, bot synergy and the community ripping Ry0ma for being a waste of an import slot that is apparently at best 9th mid in the league. Not 3RD place.

He drew so much pressure, played a bunch of different roles within the split. Looked good in both wins and losses. Best top laner in the LCS

Yes, C9 one of the best splits ever, great TEAM.
But to say that on an individual level that Nisqy or Blaber or even Vulcan was the MOST VALUABLE within Cloud 9 is very hard because of the way that they play for another

Would Blabers super aggressive style work without Nisqy playing so much for the roam and following up on his plays. (Looking at someone like Closer on GGS)

Would Nisqy look as good if he was roaming to try and get ahead a FBI/Huhi lane, would the plays have been pulled off as well without the other team being fearful there was some madlad on gragas who might come out of nowhere to mess you up behind him.

Vulcan, well worth the buyout and a great split but i think many people would argue that as a support it's alot easier to do your job, and thus look better when every other role on your team is filled by someone killing it. Look at the rise and fall of core jj this split, you can't tell me he is that much worse as a player, but in terms of TL and their team play, he definitely looks alot worse But so does nearly every player on TL.

You can make a case for any player on C9 but in isolation it doesn't feel like you could make a strong case that anyone of them was more valuable for C9 than what Ssumday was for 100T

Jiizuke, definately a dark horse for MVP after what was a rough start for EG, his aggressive play and use of side lanes to get level and item advantages has been massive in them making 2nd. The inconsistency from the start of the split still puts Ssumday in front. It helps having the existing synergy of your jg support and even top slightly from C9 previously. 

Look, I get it.
There's some well deserved hard ons for C9 and they have every right to all the accolades that come to them for their consistency, play and hard work.
All Pro etc.
But don't not give it to LCS best boy in the top lane just cause his team didn't come first. 

Ssumday meets the Criteria for Most Valuable Player and the votes should reflect that

fsnqf1,Flint124,I'd prefer it if we didn't have the PBE in its current form.,"*In theory*, the purpose of the PBE is to test new features for balance and bugs.

*In practice*, they simply do not do that. They don't fix things like that unless they're big enough for Vandril to make a video on, and if it's big enough for Vandril to find you'd expect a multi-billion dollar company's internal testing team to be able to find on their own. Hell, we can't even count on them to fix *those*, since [**THIS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMg7ZEV5x5I) made it to live.

The only thing PBE *does* is kill all hype for new releases.

When the Fiddle teaser dropped, do you know how *hype* it would have been if it ended with the ""Fiddle... stiiiiiiicks"" voice line as text said ""available now""?

But no, instead of logging on one day to find a new, awesome take on a classic character, we were *shown* that character and told ""Ok, if you want to play him either sit in 2 hours of dodged lobbies where you have a 10% chance of getting the new champion or you can wait two weeks"".

Similarly if the Wukong update had just dropped, we'd just be seeing ""Hey, Riot's buffing Wukong"" instead of having seen Riot flounder around on the PBE for more than a year, giving off the impression that ""Riot doesn't really know what to do with Wukong, do they?""

No, I'm not saying to get rid of PBE entirely, but I do think it should be used much less.

Have PBE inactive most of the time, only bringing it out for highly experimental things like the Teemo rework, Wukong update, and Mandrake Wards; things that are universally understood as being *just ideas you're tinkering around with and need data for* and not likely to be put on live as-is, or for things like Seth where you're trying to figure out how to code something without crashing the game, and can slide it past us by putting those abilities into the game disguised as updates to older champions or PVE creatures.

fsnprg,Moondude1337,What does your ranked season has ended mean?,"I logged onto league today and got a message that said something like: ""your ranked season has ended because of a dodge/disconnect."" At first I was like, does that mean I cant play ranked anymore? Why am I even receiving this message? The only thing I can think of is in the last 2 weeks of playing I have quit 2 ranked games. One was because my building was put on lock down due to a real world issue and the other was a ranked game I quit during the picking champion page. So I went and tried to play a ranked game. The client allowed me to enter a ranked queue like it normally does and I just finished playing that game. So what does it even mean? Does leaving 2 ranked games in the last 2 weeks really trigger such a warning? 

Note: I think I quit 2 out of about 20 games in the last month. I know that ratio is kinda high 10% but before this I Have never left a game during the match. I have only ever quit in the champion select page about once a month. My rule is if i'm going to quit, quit at the champion select screen so I don't drag other people into a game with me.",6,1585696548,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsnprg/what_does_your_ranked_season_has_ended_mean/,leagueoflegends,2

fsnlf0,Nyptes,Give Zyra's R more power.,"Our plant girl needs a little bit more than just a knock up on R. I mean come on, what was Riot thinking?

Imagine this: you play your lane, and suddenly your enemy laner wants to trade. That's fine, your plants fight back for you. They want to continue? You press R, and the enemy are knocked up. What now? Exactly. There is nothing you can do afterwards but rely on your team to help in securing the kill.

Now imagine this: Zrya's ult turns her plants into Nautiluses. Yes. Nautiluses. This will show her some love and would be a small buff which would be enough to help boost her play rate as well as viability. By having this small change in her R and plant, you can now trade with the enemy until they run away because they overestimated their power against the might Zrya.

Without these small changes, how is she suppose to close the game pre 20 minutes without being able to properly 1 v 4? Show Zrya some love, and give her R the ability to change her plants into Nautiluses.

While we are at that, what would you guys think about this: anytime she is in a bush, she is camouflaged for 15 seconds and gains a small execute on her next ability or auto? This would help her gain a bit more kill pressure, and the enemy laner won't be inclined to trade with her anyways unless they want to int to accelerate the process of the lost game. So therefore the game would end faster, no one has to waste their time, and Zrya would be viable again.

But a month ago i found a dirt cheap pc! I bought it off a old Lady whoes late husband was into computer stuff. She had No idea what the price was gonna be so we sat down to talk, and to cut it short i got it for free!! (for you nerds like me i5 2500k 4gb ram 630 GPU) finally i can play my beloved game agian! I knew a lot had changed since i last played. And holy shit, it was rough the first games, but got into it quick! Well after my 10 placements i got Iron 3....... Fuck me right? Ohh well i thougt on, and got to bronze 5 without much fuss. (i have always been a high bronze scrub) and I just kept going at it! And then i just skipped bronze 4 and fucking 3! Straight into bronze 2! Fuck yea!

I have to mention, i sit in my chouch and playing on my tv since i am a broke as fuck student! So i got back into it on my main role as a adc lucian main, and I stomped most games in bot lane, but som games are just lost. Ohh well i got into the promo for b1 and lost it. Shit! I was furious! Shit teammates both games. I then got on a 4 win streak and won my promo! Finnaly bronze 1! I can smell silver now!!!

After a almost 2 year long break it only took me a few weeks to get to bronze 1!

I just wanted to share the good news with you Guys who share my love for the game!

My goal is to get high silver low gold at the end og this season! What is your goal for this season?

fsmop7,takaoa42,I really need you to help me solve this challenge!,"Hey there!

Recently i got a challenge, from a friend of mine.

The challenge is to solve a 1v5 Intermediate Bot game (Renekton, Annie, Veigar, Cho'Gath, Malphite).

Sounds easy right? But you need to play and win with those champions:  
Lee Sin  
Udyr  
Aurelion Sol  
Maokai  
Blitzcrank  
Soraka

And on every Champion a viable Build (Like you would build in a ranked)

&amp;#x200B;

I already won with Lee, Aurelion, Maoka and Udyr. But also with a troll Blitzcrank Build (Wich doesn't count).

But with the other ones i struggle hard.

Do you guys can help me to beat this challenge?

**all the tanky supports** (they are unfun to play against and at lvl3 do more damage than an adc and have cc): leona, nautilus, thresh(the complaints are mostly that he is played all the time so not sure?)

**all the ranged that are being played top** (they make people want to die, literally): kennen, vlad, teemo, jayce, kalista, lucian, neeko, morde

**the poke/strong waveclear mages** (they make the game boring or are just unfun to play against): Zoe, ziggs,  xerath, azir, corki, viktor

**the one that can oneshot you** (REALLY unfun to play against): Malphite, syndra, talon, zed, riven, rengar, qyana, lb, irelia, akali

**the noob champs** (unfun to play against): yi, yasuo, kat, tryn, garen, jax, darius, lee, gragas, kass(?)

**All the champions for the last few year or reworks** (ruining the game and unfun to play against!): kai'sa, sett, wukong, aphelios, senna, sylas, xayah, ryze, pyke, ornn, pantheon

**honorable mentions**: ahri (the most useless champion in the game apparently), aatrox, kog, kayle, kled, urgot

Would someone these days be able to make it to Challenger as a mechanichally intensive champion on 60Fps considering how the game as evolved strategically, or would their inability to play as smoothly as someone playing at 144hz on a 144 monitor keep them from reaching that high despite having the skill for it?

What i'm basically saying is, how much do you think playing at less than 144fps 144hz would affect a Challenger player?

You go to play rank, you try to do your best, and yet you get that one player who either rage quit or leaves for reasons, and you lose your match cause of it.

Why is it that you still lose a large amount of points rather then the AFK player taking majority point lost and active players lose a lot less and possible preventing players from getting hit with a demote cause of that player.

We have the report system, but if you don't get enough players to report it almost nothing happens. It gets the point why even bother.

fslfu6,sophies_nutella,"101 random Opinions, Thoughts, Suggestions, Tips","1. Pool party Fiora looks a bit too thin
2. Using rift herald before 14 minutes on a tower that has 5 plates is like throwing away 600 gold
3. Playing Garen with one hand is easier than playing champs like Riven
4. Don't play OP champs; ban them
5. Unless you're playing jax or lee sin you should always have oracle lens when jungling as well as a control ward
6. Support's full build: quick boots, 4 items, 2 control wards
7. Biscuits heal you based on your missing health and missing mana
8. Biscuits increase your maximum mana
9. Biscuits can be sold (selling them still increases max mana)
10. Building health works well against true damage
11. Using Ezreal's E allows you to escape a hook even if you get hit because the blink is buffered
12. If your jungler is dead don't try to fight 2v3 for a dragon, that's beyond stupid
13. Instead of warding the bush close to your lane, ward deeper so you can see the jungler early and spot him even if he doesn't come near you.
14. Don't forget to buy elixirs
15. If you are fed but you don't convert your lead into objectives,  you're eventually going to giveaway shutdown gold and lose your lead.
16. Ganking winning lanes is almost always better than ganking losing lanes.
17. If the enemy top lane uses their teleport and you gank and kill them, they'll be useless for the next twenty minutes.
18. If you don't have 200+ games in an elo then you're not hardstuck; the way the system is designed, you're going to climb as long as you play more games.
19. If you're botlane and you just lost your tower, don't go mid; that's just going to put you further behind and hurt your midlaner.
20. Adc should only stop farming when they're full build.
21. 5 people sharing farm mid is the most popular inting strategy.
22. Don't take an inhibitor before 20 minutes unless you can properly use the pressure super minions create; otherwise, you're funneling gold into the enemy's carry.
23. Master Yi can solo baron with jungle item, boots, and 2 items.
24. Jungler's most valuable item is control ward.
25. Support's most valuable item is control ward.
26. Best part of a jungler: smite.
27. If you know you're going to fight after you kill dragon/baron, support should be tanking it
28. Baron receives 50% less damage from the champion it's attacking: this means if you're trying to sneak it, make someone who doesn't do damage tank it.
29. Support's trade their health for enemy adc; this is why biscuits are useful.
30. Nimbus cloak is pretty strong right now.
31. It's best for Vladmir to rush 45% cdr before buying anything else.
32. Grievous wounds is only 800 gold if you're building ad
33. If you know you're going to get dove, just leave instead of staying to collect 5 minions.
34. 15 cs = 1 kill.
35. You're team gets more gold if everyone gets an assist on the kill.
36. If you're behind, grouping is not a great idea.
37. If you have tp, you should be split pushing on the OPPOSITE side of the dragon/baron/rift herald that's alive right now.
38. The first tp you use should be to get back to your lane.
39. You can use ignite twice before enemy's teleport is back off cooldown.
40. If you're team is flaming you and you don't mute them, it's you're fault for getting tilted by them.
41. Target champions only is the most op setting
42. Attack move is the 2nd most op setting
43. Kiting is one of the easiest things to do by turning on target champions only and attack move (you don't have to move your mouse)
44. If the enemy jungler ganks top/bot they've probably already taken that scuttle crab.
45. If they took the scuttle on the same side you are on, don't waste time: recall, and grab the other one.
46. Help your jungler fight for scuttle crab: it's really important. If you can't ping them.
47. Ping missing enemy.
48. If you're a support and you're about to all-in, the first thing you should do once you engage is use ignite.
49. Keep track of enemy summoner spells.
50. If you get invaded, just give up the buff and go to your other one, or the enemy's buff.
51. If you're invading, don't go into vision before the buff spawns.
52. When invading, wait until enemy uses their spells on the buff.
53. When invading, jungler should focus buff and time their ability+smite combo to secure it: then you easily win the fight
54. If you're enemy laner is building too much armor for you, switch lanes with your mid.
55. Never chase. Ever.
56. Mid game support is a walking ward that carries wards, kills wards, and engages,
57. If you're support item is complete and you still have your trinket, you should just leave the game.
58. Funny how Aurelion Sol has no galaxy themed skins.
59. Yuumi is not a champion: she is a ward that follows you: useless.
60. If you are playing yuumi and you're not tanking damage you might as well be afk.
61. Botlane always push the wave when game starts.
62. If enemy is about to hit level 2 and you are still level 1, and you are close enough for them to auto/hook you, you might as well just walk under their tower.
63. Boots are very useful: tier 2 boots are extremely useful especially if you're adc.
64. Support rush tier 2 boots and control wards.
65. Quick boots are better than mobi boots now.
66. Bone-plating vs all-in champs, second wind vs poke champs
67. Don't use health potion until doran's shield fully heals you.
68. Vladmir takes doran's ring (unless you're against bitchmo)
69. Biscuit's heal you based on your missing health when you used them. It's okay to use health pots while biscuits heal you.
70. If you have 2k max health and are at 1800 hp (90%) and you eat a biscuit, you will receive 20 health. (2/15 of a health pot) If you are at 200 health (10%) you receive 180 health.
71. It's okay to use mana spells (fizz e, leblanc w) when leaving fountain because you'll regen most of it anyways.
72. When in fountain, use healing spells (master yi W, kayle w) /time warp tonic on a corrupting pot if you have more mana than health to speed your time.
73. Having 100% mana all the time is a huge waste.
74. Ask your jungler for blue buff, otherwise they'll never give it to you.
75. Being behind a level is worse than being behind a kill's worth of gold.
76. Trade when enemy has abilities on cooldown/minion disadvantage
77. Trading is using your health, abilities and mana, to make the enemy lose more health than what you expended.
78. If you have a lead, contest every single cs.
79. If you are behind, melee against a poke champ, you will have to trade health/mana for cs. If you can't get all of the cs, just stay in range to get exp.
80. Tanking two autos in order to get a ranged creep is not ideal.
81. Even if you can 1v2 1v3 etc its best to just draw pressure away from  objectives so you're team can breathe easy instead of risking a fight.
82. If the enemy procs aftershock, you really can't do any damage until they explode.
83. Wait until their conqueror stacks fall off.
84. Don't let them proc press the attack.
85. Use your shields to block important spells/damage.
86. Stop placing herald mid on autopilot.
87. Jungler should capture eye of herald in almost every case.
88. Give up the dragon, live another day.
89. Don't fight on-hit champs (master yi, nocturne, master yi, master yi) if you don't have any abilities up. They're itemizing to strengthen their autos so you're obviously going to lose.
90. There is so much to learn about the game that you couldn't even imagine.
91. Always play to learn.
92. If you're low elo, stop playing tanks...do really trust your teammates?
93. Learn macro before micro.
94. Shutdown gold is helpful.
95. Grievous wounds, armor, magic resist, tenacity are so valuable but no one takes it.
96. Stop watch is pretty useful on engage supports/diving champions.
97. It's not the jungler's job to babysit your tower. But if you are jungler, don't ignore free cs mid.
98. If you just killed enemy top and they have tp, help your top shove the wave if they're low.
99. If there are more enemy minions in the lane, and you help your laner shove it, you just inted them.
100. Don't invade if you have less cc.
101. Don't invade without prio.",11,1585689108,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fslfu6/101_random_opinions_thoughts_suggestions_tips/,leagueoflegends,4

fslbkg,Masterfire76,Predictions: 2020 Spring Split Awards,"Hey guys! What is your predictions for the Spring Split Awards (I switched the Rookie of the Split for the Newcomer of the Split)

**Honda Most Valuable Player**

1-Vulcan, C9

2-Blaber, C9

3-Nisqy, C9

I think Vulcan flew under the radar. Yeah, Nisqy and Blaber were better to carry, but I think Vulcan was the stone to enable them in the mid game.

**Newcomer of the Split**

1-Jiizuke, EG

2-Closer, GG

3-Ryoma, 100T

Johnsun being the only real rookie with Eika, i switched it to the Newcomer of the Split. I think Jiizuke was by far the best new player in the LCS with Closer. I think Ryoma was a little bit better than Johnsun too.

**LCS Coach of the Split**

1-Reapered, C9

2-Irean, EG

3-Zikz, 100T

Reapered is the best. But Irean helped CLG finish second last season and, now, EG finish second. Zikz deserves a lot of credit too.

**LCS All-Pro Team**

*1st team*

Top -&gt; Licorice, C9

Jungle -&gt; Blaber, C9

Mid -&gt; Nisqy, C9

ADC -&gt; Zven, C9

Support -&gt; Vulcan, C9

*2nd team*

Top -&gt; Ssumday, 100T

Jungle -&gt; Closer, GG

Mid -&gt; PowerOfEvil, FLY

ADC -&gt; Bang, EG

Support -&gt; BioFrost, TSM

*3rd team*

Top -&gt; BrokenBlade, TSM

Jungle -&gt; Xmithie, IMT

Mid -&gt; Jiizuke, EG

ADC -&gt; CodySun, 100T

Support -&gt; IgNar, FLY

The first team is easy. After that, i think you can make a argument for a lot of players. Top, Ssumday and BrokenBlade are the obvious choice. In the jungle, you could make a case for Svenskeren, Dardoch or Meteos. In the mid, Froggen could be a option, but I think POE and Jiizuke were the two best midlaner after Nisqy. ADC, some people could make a case for FBI. Aphromoo and Hakuho could be consider as support too.",3,1585688741,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fslbkg/predictions_2020_spring_split_awards/,leagueoflegends,1

fslazc,MOOL_NA,If Aphelios were released in season 2,"Passive: Hextech Augment or something

Aphelios has an attachment to his firearm that he can change in order to adapt to situations. Each one of his basic abilities is a toggle that can last for 10/15/20/25 basic attacks at levels 1/6/11/16. His ammo for each attachment recharges at a rate of 1 per five seconds. The recharge time is decreased by two seconds per 75% attack speed.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: Extended Barrel

&amp;#x200B;

Aphelios gains 150 attack range and gains 5%/10%/15%/20%/25% extra movement speed for 2 when he hits an enemy champion. This bonus cannot stack.

&amp;#x200B;

W: Explosive Rounds

&amp;#x200B;

Aphelios's attacks deal 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9 of his total attack damage to his target, but deal 1.1/1.15/1.2/1.25/1.3 of his total attack damage in an area around them. This area explosion deals 80% damage to minions.

&amp;#x200B;

E: Siphoning Rounds

&amp;#x200B;

Aphelios heals for 20/35/50/65/80 (+0.5 bonus AD) per auto attack.

&amp;#x200B;

R: Shell Launch

&amp;#x200B;

Aphelios launches a shell forward which explodes upon hitting an enemy champion, with a bonus effect depending on what toggle Aphelios has enabled.

&amp;#x200B;

No toggle: Deals 200/350/500 (+1.0 bonus AD) damage in an area.

&amp;#x200B;

Siphoning rounds toggled: Deals 150/225/350 (+0.7 bonus AD) damage in an area, healing Aphelios for 75/125/200 (+0.3 bonus AD) if an enemy champion is hit, increased by 10% for each additional champion.

&amp;#x200B;

Explosive rounds toggled: Deals 200/300/400 (+0.8 AD) damage in a larger area.

&amp;#x200B;

Extended barrel toggled: Deals the same damage and gains 300 range, granting him 10%/20%/30% movement speed for three seconds if it hits an enemy champion.

&amp;#x200B;

No ghost sister, no modified HUD, just a dude with a cool gun. He'd be from piltover and probably be friends with Jayce or some shit and they'd make cool guns together and talk about how much Viktor sucks.

Is it possible to buy the chromas later in the store, or are they only able to be bought with these tokens and will they never get added to the store anymore? Maybe later on with one of those Blue Essence sales?

fsktmy,CharismaticO5,History of SKT (Chapter II),"Hi! Here’s the second part of SKT’s story but first let’s remember where we left off. SKT, already a very successful organization in esports, decided to create two teams of League of Legends. The first was acquired from Eat Sleep Game, with Reapered leading the way as the shotcaller and star. The second, a group of rookies with experienced players  that generated high expectations. After a long qualifying tournament, both teams qualified for Spring Split 2013.

# Spring 2013

At that time the server in Korea had been around for about 1 year, so a new generation of talents had appeared to stay. It was the second generation of players, the first coming from NA servers when the game was first formed. Bengi, Faker and Piglet were some of the most interesting players of this second generation and kkOma convinced them to join SKT 2 alongside Impact (first generation) and PoohManDu. This second team, despite being new, had high expectations of qualifying for playoffs, even though the draw left them in the death group with CJ Blaze, Najin Sword, KT Arrows, MVP Ozone and MVP Blue.

As for SKT 1, the team had a perfect start winning the IEM Cologne the previous year, but the results in China's StarsWar League and the qualys for IEM Katowice left a bad taste. The team relied heavily on Reapered, with an inconsistent bot and a mid with a small champ pool.  Despite this, SKT 1 was expected to qualify for playoffs with no problems by having a more accessible group.

This is how the history of SKT began at the highest level. SKT 2 debuted nothing more and nothing less than against CJ Blaze, a team where one of the best mid laners in the world played in Ambition. Game 1, minute 6:20, Faker has his counterpart under tower and is harassing him with aa, hits the Q, jumps in and first kill of his career, what a statement it was. SKT won the [series 2-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNscLv6l6tU) and continued to win the group with a 3-1-1. The only team to stop them was MVP Ozone, a team that will surely ring the names of Homme, DanDy, dade, imp and Mata. Meanwhile, SKT 1 did his thing and tied ALL the series they played, finishing third in their group with a 0-5-0. Come on, it was what was expected from them.

Playoffs came and SKT 1 fell 0-3 against CJ Blaze, a far superior team in every respect with a stellar top laner in Flame. On the other hand, SKT 2 defeated NaJin Shield 3-0 and would face, guess who, MVP Ozone in the SF. Summing up the split, SKT2 had immense talent, so superlative that many times just that alone was enough to win games. Faker, Piglet and PoohManDu dominated their lanes at pleasure with Impact adjusting to what the team needed. And bengi? the right hand. He was not a dominant jungler like DanDy or KaKAO, but the aggressiveness of his teammates allowed him to invade, ward, gank and any other movements that were gold for the team. However, MVP Ozone was different. DanDy didn't care so much about Faker, but about the side lanes, and he exerted such pressure that soon bengi was behind, then his teammates and in the end, the whole SKT team. MVP Ozone [won 3-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPhEgGOPTeE) and then became champions against CJ Blaze while SKT2 won third place against CJ Frost.

# Summer

SKT1, after falling in quarters against CJ Blaze, qualified for the NLB Spring, a tournament played by the eliminated teams from the OGN. There, they ended fourth behind both sets of NaJin and KT Bullets. These results, added to the success of SKT2, resulted in SK Telecom undoing the team for Summer. Reapered, Raven, and StarLast went to Jin Air Falcons, SuNo went as a sub to MVP Blue and Beelzehan stayed on SKT as a sub to bengi.

For SKT2, expectations were even higher after the impressive Spring debut, and the team more than met. They improved their macro with good rotations and better teamfighting that, along with their superiority in micro, put them first in the group ahead of NaJin Shield, MVP Blue and Incredible Miracle 2. In playoffs, an easy 3-0 to their ex-teammates from Jin Air Falcons, a precious revenge against MVP Ozone in the semifinals, and then [The Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvXLe9xT1UE).

SKT was facing KT Rolster Bullets. KaKAO was the star, one of the best jungles in the world with that aggressive style that fans liked. In fact, KaKAO was so outstanding that upon returning to KTB, he sent inSec to the top lane to the detriment of Ssumday. Ryu was one of the best mid laners in the world and Score and Mafa completed a bot lane that always showed good level and Score, the adc, had an exemplary positioning despite not being as flashy as Piglet or imp. The final was unforgettable, one of the best Bo5 ever with two teams and top players. The way to solve it, of course, was a Game 5 with Blind picks that would end up leaving us the [incredible 1v1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vGaC4OZIs) from Faker to Ryu with Zed. Less than 1 year after creating the team SKT2 were champions of Korea, but it wasn't everything.

# Worlds 2013

As OGN Summer champions, SKT qualified for the final round of the gauntlet where they faced, again, KT Bullets. They repeated the victory, now by an easier 3-1. In this way, SKT qualified to Worlds as one of the favorites to win the trophy. In the group stage they made good account of the above and were first with an impressive 7-1. They defeated Lemondogs, TSM and GamingGear. eu without problems, but OMG was a more complicated rival. The Chinese, led by Gogoing, LoveLing and Cool, managed to score 1-1 against SKT, as well as finishing second with the same record of 7-1. Anyway, the [famous SKT push](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM9fqtc2lyo&amp;t=30s) that ended in an inhibitor at 12 minutes vs OMG was a clear example of the team's potential.

SKT easily took care of Gamania Bears in QF (2-0) and faced NaJin Black Sword in SF. NJBS was a team full of talent, with one of the best top laners in Expession, a jungler that represented the aggressive style of the time in watch, a new star figure in Nagne and a high level bot lane with PraY and Cain.  However, NJBS had been leaving poor results and was only in Worlds for what they had done the previous season. Also, they had not gone through the group stage either, so the semifinal didn't promise to be much disputed. But the truth is that this SF would become one of the best Bo5s in history. NJBS and SKT gave us a memorable series and SKT took the [3-2 victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebhrVu7CKkQ)

In the final, Royal Club awaited, a team that came from defeating OMG in QF and the legendary Fnatic lineup in SF. RYL had already experienced players, but the star was a very young Uzi who was already a sensation worldwide.  The closed semifinal against NJBS and the great level shown by RYL led to a final that promised a lot, but it was not like that. SKT swept with a [resounding 3-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsO88QkLNmY) and took home the title. The Korean Hype Train was real and SKT was the best team in the world by far.

fskbs7,Numquid,Solo player+solo laner experience in normal draft is terrible and unfair,"As a solo player and laner, going into normal draft i always get matched with 3 or 4 premades (70-80% of the time over 100s of games). This is usually by itself an insanely toxic experience for so many reasons, (flaming, blaming me for everything, getting 0 help/ignored by the jungler, my cs gets taxed by everybody etc.). 

But other than that, as a solo laner my opponent is now most likely premade with several of his team mates (usually the jungler). This often results in getting hard camped by 3 or 4 players while getting completely ignored and even blamed for feeding by my own team. It literally feels like a 1v9 and such an awful experience.

Can you blame me if i leave the game after 10 or 15 minutes?",10,1585685624,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fskbs7/solo_playersolo_laner_experience_in_normal_draft/,leagueoflegends,0

fsk9wd,Nyptes,Zrya buffs are necessary for her to be viable,"Our plant girl needs a little bit more than just a knock up on R. I mean come on, what was Riot thinking?

Imagine this: you play your lane, and suddenly your enemy laner wants to trade. That's fine, your plants fight back for you. They want to continue? You press R, and the enemy are knocked up. What now? Exactly. There is nothing you can do afterwards but rely on your team to help in securing the kill.

Now imagine this: Zrya's ult turns her plants into Nautiluses. Yes. Nautiluses. This will show her some love and would be a small buff which would be enough to help boost her play rate as well as viability. By having this small change in her R and plant, you can now trade with the enemy until they run away because they overestimated their power against the might Zrya.

Without these small changes, how is she suppose to close the game pre 20 minutes without being able to properly 1 v 4? Show Zrya some love, and give her R the ability to change her plants into Nautiluses.

While we are at that, what would you guys think about this: anytime she is in a bush, she is camouflaged for 15 seconds and gains a small execute on her next ability or auto? This would help her gain a bit more kill pressure, and the enemy laner won't be inclined to trade with her anyways unless they want to int to accelerate the process of the lost game. So therefore the game would end faster, no one has to waste their time, and Zrya would be viable again.

fsjfiv,Dezusx,What Theorycrafts are You Playing?,"I love RPGs and I have really enjoyed LoL for a long time.  Lately I been really into trying to find unthought-of ways to synergize items and kits.  One cool one I saw is Bloodrazor Rammus, which definitely is ""out there"" but for sure has some validity in some cases.  

My personal theorycraft that I have been personally enamored with is Glacial Skarner, with Cinderhulk and second item Twin Shadows.  Skarner loves the AP really only scales well with the shield, but the move speed and cdr go well with him.  And of course the active is amazing as no one get escape his sting!  It turns into a late game uber-utility tank bruiser.  But it is odd as it is a late game build unless laning last long enough to get your second item finished before it ends.  

Since the BotRK buff I also wanted to build on-hit Warwick, but have not got fed enough to pull if off yet.

What are some cool ones you all are testing or playing?  Creative stuff like a decently viable tank Viktor before it became meta are awesome to me.  The thing I am most into is trying to find ways to use support items on different champs to buff/create new carries - Glacial, Twin Shadow, Zekes Convergence, Tank, Skarner running at you with Olaf is nothing nice!",10,1585682799,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsjfiv/what_theorycrafts_are_you_playing/,leagueoflegends,4

fsjahq,SIXTEENta,Report system is a joke right now and needs to be fixed,"Ive been learning ADC this week, and that comes with losing some lanes in normals to get good. Understandably, this comes with some banter from your teammates.

So I have no problem with teammates remarking my bad score, accusing me from losing the game... When i do poorly in a game i expect those comments and I understand getting frustrated for losing when it is not your fault.

What I have a problem with its with people calling you a retard, an ape, acussing you of being an ""egirl"" while stating sexist remarks, throwing games... It goes without saying that this kind of behaivor should be unaccepted.

Last game I was called an ape by my support all game for failing 2 cannons, then he tried to get my farm, then i got 2 kills and started running it down as spite. When it finished he and his premade reported me. And I reported him, but I know because he didnt explicitly said the n word or the f word he wont get punishment for his actions, even if he sabbotaged a game for 4 other people, and a lot more.

And thats the story of all the other games I played on this game, not only this week. I has some very questionable people and I only got the ""your report has resulted in a ban"" pop up 2 times.

So yeah I kind of am tilted for all the flaming i have recieved this week, but I think this is some legitimate feedback, because I feel like a big portion of the playerbase agrees with me. I would love what all you have to say tho.",32,1585682366,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsjahq/report_system_is_a_joke_right_now_and_needs_to_be/,leagueoflegends,6

fsij9q,Compile_Heart,Play Fill in Ranked for a change.,"I'm not great at this game by any means so I'm not high elo. But I have noticed something, if you pick to just queue fill not only will you generally get support (blitz is fun and pretty good atm) but your team's typically get a little better. 

Imagine the times you queue for top, and then the support asks to switch with you. We go into the Sky Williams situation that now both of you probably gonna be fucked. Even if it's not you then the other members of your team might switch roles and now everyone playing weird roles.

I should mention I really only played Top/Jungle for years but more often than not if you play fill even if you aren't the best at what you get filled at, chances are pretty decent that your team playing their best role will pick up the slack.

Also it doesn't only fill you in support, but I have noticed that at silver 2 mmr I mostly get bottom or support filled. But really you get every single role usually within a span of 10 games. It helps me with boredom too not doing the same thing every game.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk on just going fill in ranked.",0,1585680044,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsij9q/play_fill_in_ranked_for_a_change/,leagueoflegends,0

fsi90g,Phreaksmom,Bring back the old seasons of League,"Isnt it funny how winratios of above 70% (of a reasonable amount of games) are declining in higher elo?   


I miss the old league where being SKILLEd was actually rewarded instead of this coinflip game we have today. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to win 4v5 games anymore. In S1-S7 4v5's were rather winable. Why has that been changed? Why are you punishing the competetive player base, I mean, there is other ways of making it a joyful experience for beginners instead of significantly reducing individual impact on the game. I mean, it is not like that it is possible to go 5 games without afk'ers or inters, but yet we are the one taking the consequences.    


I can only reach one conclusion or best answer to why you have chosen this path. It is the most profitable to embrace everyone and turning it into this coinflip game so more people are frustrated to grind and its easier for beginners to win games. It results in more players, more purchases, and more frustrated grinding etc.   


I wish you had any passion and respect for what you have created instead of focusing so hard on cosmetics and releasing new completely OP champions just to make people buy more, while frustrating the player base even more.

* Garbage teammates that int the game.

By far the biggest offender, this hard tilts me because it often just outright makes games wastes of time and unplayable and there is no easy solution to this. Unlike flaming, you can't mute someone going 0/10.

* Dumb Macro decisions your team makes even though your call is objectively better

When you make a smart call to go baron after 4 man wiping their team, but your team ignores it to tower dive the twitch under tower and feeding him several kills, this is very tilting.

* Elo Hell deniers

A secondary source of tilt, these are people who act like they know better about the matchmaking, despite having no evidence to support their claims, pretending like elo hell doesnt exist, despite the evidence and motives riot would have to implement it. Imagine everyone saying a tree was actually a dragon over and over, even though you know full well its a tree, that would tilt you after enough time.

How do I stop this tilt? Nothing seems to work, and every time I think about league when im tilted, I just think of these garbage games and players that int and the privileged high elo players who denies that this shit happens.",19,1585678022,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fshvun/how_to_stop_perma_tilt/,leagueoflegends,0

fshlhs,Lord_Rejnols,My personal problem with Top lane is the power of the simple champions.,"Before i go any further, yes you can make an argument for these champions having some things that can differentiate the players skill level and or other champions being easier. However in high gold/low plat everyone and their mother know how their lanning and trading patterns go.

My personal beef at the moment is with Garen, Darius, Sett and to a slightly lesser degree Mordekaiser.

Lets start with Garen. There are litterly two ways Garen trades in lane.  
1. He starts with Q to deny the enemy the ability to trade back, uses E and stays on them. If the enemy isn't low enough to execute with ult or they used flash/mobility to get away, Garen backs off with W (which btw dosen't just give a 10% MAX HP shield, but also 60% damage reduction on top of the passive armor and magic resist) to absorb whatever poke is thrown after him while he disengages. If he somehow still took a decent amount of damage, maybe from minions, he goes away until his passive starts popping and he is ready to go in again.

2. Same as before, but instead of backing off he uses ult to finish the enemy off.

Next up is Mr. Dunk himself, Darius.  
His passive at level 3 gives him 40 AD if he gets to 5 stacks, so the enemy can't trade within auto range. Oh but even if you get away before he has 5 stacks on you, you  lose the trade because the bleed at 3 stacks deals at level three deals 75 + 150% bonus AD (so even a dorans blade or long sword adds 15-20 dmg).

My personal problem with this guy is that he dosen't even have a trade pattern. He has a ""you better have some mobility to get away from this"" pattern. If you walk within melee range, you get hit by the 90% slow which lets him land 1-2 more auto's after which he can pull you in to guarantee another 2 autos and hit you with that beefy 5 stack Q.  
If you have have some kind of ranged ability that allows you to farm from distance, he can walk behind your minions to completely keep you out of range. ""omg just play a ranged champion"" sure i do that sometimes, but there are two problems with that. First is that i don't always pick my champion before the enemy does, and two that even when you do play ranged you have to be so careful not to misstep or else he will still obliterate you, which i honestly think is fair in this case, but he dosen't just do it to ranged champs, but melee as well. His recent nerfs made it a little better, but all they really changed was that E can't be spammed.

&amp;#x200B;

I was gonna write some stuff about Sett and Mordekaiser as well, but this post is getting very long. I am sure many people disagree with what i say here, these are just my personal feelings. I know i am not alone in this, because when i ask my friends (who dosen't even main Top) about these champions they almost all feel the same. I fine with simple champions existing but as i have seen many others bring up, these are very very simple champions that are insanely strong. Even in my rank (High gold/low plat) every top laner knows how to use these champions at high efficiency in lane.",625,1585677121,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fshlhs/my_personal_problem_with_top_lane_is_the_power_of/,leagueoflegends,11

fshk6t,MoeZaic99,Why is Dopa still banned??," It seems kind of ridiculous that he is still banned in 2020. Other players that were indefinitely banned are streaming happily ever after on twitch and making money.  
People have: threatened the lives of others, said the N word, boosted, have 20+ permabanned accounts, int, grief, afk, and all this bullshit, and one way or another they end up being ""reformed"" and stream to hundreds / thousands of viewers and still display toxic behavior on stream.  


 What did Apdo do?? He boosted for money... He spent thousands of hours / his whole existence on competitive games to become the best, he really loved it, and if he gets a job on top of his school he wont have as much time to play, so he boosted. Now he is super rich and doesn't need to boost anymore, he probably makes 1000x more streaming on Chinese sites to millions. He has a 1,000 year ban on the Korean server, Faker or any other pro player can't even mention his name on air because of his ban, but faker can make videos irl with Tyler1, and Tyler1 was allowed to cast all-stars I believe a while ago. (This is not attacking tyler1, we've seen how he turned out and how has basically the face of LoL twitch streamers). What threat is Apdo to the community? He's never threatened to sl\*t someone's throat, and is considerably the best LoL solo q player of all time. He is super OCD and can't go pro, he couldn't even stream in China because something felt wrong even though he set up his room centimeter by centimeter to match his room in Korea, and has the same clothes and temperature and was about to go home and give up because something just felt wrong. Luckily, someone told him to go to his computer on the control panel / task bar or something, and check if he had x enabled or disabled, I don't remember, but he enabled or disabled it and all of a sudden it felt like his room in Korea again so he was able to stay (Dopa said he is extremely lucky, and was willing to go as far to say that might have been the only person in the world to think about that). He even said it is impossible for him to get masters without his chair, something happened to his chair or desk and it was an inch shorter / higher and he couldn't play solo q anymore for a while until he got it fixed. So at the time, boosting was realistically the only way of making real money, it is very hard to make money in Korea without a degree, people work 12 hours there just to pay off their bills.   


 I am not completely justifying him boosting, I am just adding perspective... I am saying Dopa should be given another chance just like Riot has gave to all the other streamers / players. It is just such a shame for such talent to not be forgiven like this, Apdo should be unbanned from the KR server and welcomed back to his own home.  


TL;DR: Apdo / Dopa should be forgiven and given a second chance, his ""crimes"" weren't nearly as bad as some other people, and it would be a positive thing if he finally gets unbanned from the KR Server.

This is shit talking and it happens in every competitive game or sport. 

On the other hand I also can fall victim to the constantly negative talk myself due to the nature of solo q and my own difficultly managing my ego/reactions.

Also is it toxic to swear? Like, If a duo is shitting on me nonstop for the champ I picked and then spam ping me when I make a mistake am I toxic for sticking up for myself and retaliating with a good ol fashioned ""fuck you""?

fsgwqr,texas_bad_place,Some thoughts on champion design,"I was playing a little Lee Sin last night and started thinking about how crazy it is that a champion that was made so long ago is still consistently a staple in the meta.

Champions come and go rise and fall. Lee Sin (for the most part) is forever.

I think part of the reason why Lee Sin has stuck around for so long is because his kit is simple, but when used cohesively, becomes complex. There isn't an ability in his kit that you couldn't explain to a 5 year old, yet he is one of the highest skill cap champions in the game.

I think this is true for a lot of older champions that have stuck around. Reworked nidalee, for example, has a fairly simple kit, but when pushed to it's boundaries looks like a completely different champion.

It feels like the creative expression of the champion is in the hands of the player, not the designer. I think riot has shied away from designing champions like this in recent history, in favor of oppressive expression by the designer adding in ""cool and innovative mechanics ™️""

Aphelios feels like a big offender of this. A designer jerking themself off to show off some creativity while taking expression away from the player. The player doesn't choose the gun, they roll with the punches, all so a designer can jerk themself off a little bit.",6,1585674939,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsgwqr/some_thoughts_on_champion_design/,leagueoflegends,2

fsgw9t,ShimazuDelight,League is just not fun,"Long story short - came back to league after about 6 months. 

Game was pretty fun for a bit. Played support and jungle, was learning etc.

However quickly realized it is more snowbally than ever, champion imbalance is just hilarious. Wukong with a clone that actually moves? AND he gets 2 ultimates? Does riot even play their own game?

Champions I enjoy playing of course are still nerfed after literally years of having less than 2% play. 

The worst part of all of course: the community. You literally can't go into a single game without toxicity. Half the games I go into I don't even show my champion preferences. All my champions are off meta picks. Half the time if I show my champion preference my own team bans it. How is this a fun environment to play in?

All of my friends refuse to play with me anymore, so this was sort of a last hurrah for me. Probably the quickest I've ever uninstalled league - as it is common for me to play in spurts through the years. This however, was just awful. 

Riot needs to take the path of every other developer and just create a 'classic' league where you can play in say S4 with the S4 meta and patches. Would be much more fun than watching aphelios shit on my face and have no clue in the least what the hell the champion even does.",4,1585674894,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsgw9t/league_is_just_not_fun/,leagueoflegends,0

fsflpz,kr_inf,Implement a feature to punish players who deliberately ban the champion you intended to play (ranked),"TL;DR: If a teammate bans your champion in champ select, you get to choose whether your teammate gets punished (like team killing in Rainbow Six Siege)

&amp;#x200B;

So this has happened and still happens to me quite often and sometimes multiple times a day. I like to play Yasuo and thus, I also play him in ranked. Sometimes tho some people just ban him even tho I showed that i want to play him with the intent feature.

Don't get me wrong I totally understand that sometimes you just don't pay attention and just ban the champion you always ban. But (!) sometimes, people do it on purpose and then write something like ""can't leave champ X open, too op"" (yes, this has happened to me when i  wanted to play Pyke).

 I feel like something like this should be handled like in for example Rainbow Six Siege where if a teammate kills you you get to choose whether this should be punished or not. Just that when a teammate bans ""your"" champion, you get a pop-up window asking you if you want this to be punished or not (maybe not even a punishment, it could also be a free dodge where just the person who banned the champion loses his 3 LP). How this is handled in detail is up to Riot, I just think there be any punishment / way to stop this from happening.",13,1585670772,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsflpz/implement_a_feature_to_punish_players_who/,leagueoflegends,0

fsf9ut,MrPraedor,Is TL's spring split performance most disappointing in League of Legends history?,"Like most of us know TL placed 9th this spring in LCS. By all means this was historic underperformance in NA LCS. This got me wondering what has been biggest disappointment in League history.

Personally I don't think that single match loses aren't comparable for whole tournament which would rule out games like ALL vs KBM or EDG vs INTZ. 

Here are some of the same level disappointing performances from different teams in different parts of history.

* Samsung Ozone at S3 Worlds. This also gave us the infamous Dade Award.

* LGD at S5 Worlds. EDG had just won MSI and LGD was front runner with SKT to win Worlds.

* G2-8 at S6 MSI. LEC came to MSI expecting good performance after OG and FNC made semis at Worlds and FNC was able to beat LPL and LCS representatives at IEM Katowice.

* GenG at S8 Worlds. GenG came to Worlds as defending champions and had made finals 2 years in row. Was not as favoured as LGD was coming to Worlds, but had worse score going 1-5.

* FW at LMS S9 summer. Fall of LMS power house going from MSI to 6th place (2nd last).",125,1585669714,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsf9ut/is_tls_spring_split_performance_most/,leagueoflegends,9

fserqp,twitchtvVodky,Waiting after a Dodge.," Hello everyone. I am a longtime LoL player so I think I have a little bit of experience (not skill) in the game. My question was about the waiting penalty after dodging a ranked game. Okay to lose lp, is ok but why one must be punished with another penalty. 4 minutes ago it happened to have Teemo top and Victor support (I was ADC). No tanks while the enemy team had a normal comp (as expected in a ranked). Game dodged clearly, 90% this would be a defeat, it often happens to have such a team and lose, oh wait my 5 min penalty is over byeeeee",2,1585668048,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fserqp/waiting_after_a_dodge/,leagueoflegends,0
fsequg,bip_bip_cabbage,"I'm never dreading any new champion release, it's more of a sense of excitement.","Honestly, the way Season 10 makes me ask myself, ""Ooh, how's this going to shift the meta,"" and augment all forms of play I never ""dread"" to play against or with them.


Looking back in retrospect Senna has been hella fun to play because of her soul mechanic in the way that you can play her as farming/fasting ADC or support, Sett has been simply fun to play as (RKO-ing everyone out of nowhere) and interesting to play against (risk-reward on using W too early or late), and Aphelios, while having initial problems, I feel as though has ironically been flattened to be a generic weapons specialist with no mobility.


Any new champion that comes out may initially have far too much in their kit and frustrate the playerbase, and every time another one comes out may repeat the cycle all over again.


(Parody over).


But from the player standpoint, I enjoy new releases. Like honestly, with over 140+ champions and different project teams in the background, I can understand that Riot needs to balance both power creep and interest in new releases. But with every release we get new lore, music, interactions, and sometimes, revival of champions that act as counters.


And let's be honest; my top 5 hated champs aren't even those that are release within the past 3 years. And this subreddit's hate list of Yasuo, Riven, Zed; they haven't been reworked or released in the last 5 (ok but fuck Wukong right now).


And if we're talking about reworks in the past 3 years, then of the 15 total since Warwick, only three (Akali, Aatrox, Irelia) has had that big of power issues (I mean, Morde is a tad strong rn, and Kayle had her own mini issue that got resolved).


But why not look at both the negatives and the positives? Like this upcoming Fiddles rework? Dope as fuck. Senna, from Lucian's lore as a Champion? Hype as fuck to start the season. An assassin support that revolves around Ks-ing? Maybe more people will play support. A champion that acts as a buff and has an attachment mechanic? Let's see how that works.


Like keep sending new content in moderation; I'd rather have new content that gets balanced in a few weeks then years of receiving nothing at all and no changing the meta.",25,1585667966,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsequg/im_never_dreading_any_new_champion_release_its/,leagueoflegends,7

fsemp8,EggPepperSalt,"Is it in ""One For All"", against the rules to go to the lane that someobody else already called for?","Hi,

I encountered several times in ""One For All"" where people just instantly call for pre top or pre bot and when I go to either of those lanes, they spam ping me and tell me to leave and go to another lane.

The teams I encounter, mostly claim that it's against the rules, but when I read the ""7. USER RULES"" in the ""Terms of Service"", I don't see the rule listed there (I don't know for sure, maybe I am looking at the wrong place).

I know from experience that it's conventional that two players go top, one player go mid and two players go bot, but I feel like game modes like ""One For All"" are there for fun to play and can possibly deviate from the general conventions known in LoL.

I think it's fun to start with three, four or five players in one lane, pummeling down the turret early and rotating to other lanes to help.

So in short:

Is it in ""One For All"", against the rules to go to the lane that somebody else already called for?

Many thanks.

fseh1h,Swyft135,The Support Mains - A piece of poetry about League of Legends.,"**The Support Mains by Swyft135**  


My ADC - he dead.

300G for the enemy Jhin.  


I  


We are the support mains  
We are the Censor mains  
Laning together  
Our lane filled with ganks. Alas!  
Our Caution pings, when   
We whisper together  
Are quiet and meaningless  
As wind in dry grass  
or rats' feet over broken glass  
In our tri-brush  


Shape without form, shade without colour,   
We face-check with our Oracle Lenses  


Those who have crossed  
With direct eyes, to Plat IV  
Remember us - if at all - not as toxic  
Violent souls, but only  
As the support mains   
The Censor mains.   


II  


Level 31 Katarinas I dare not meet in rivers  
In League's promo games  
These do not appear:   
There, my mids are  
Nunus farming lane,   
There, is a tree swinging  
And Junglers are   
In the Herald Pit singing   
More distant and more solemn   
Than a fading star.  


Let them be no nearer  
After their level-6 powerspike  
Let them also gank  
All the other lanes  
Top lane, counterjungle, mid lane  
Vs the Yasuo who's  
Behaving as the wind behaves  
No nearer -   


Not that final meeting   
In the bot lane  


III  


This is the dead land  
This is cactus land  
Here the hooks  
Are thrown, here they receive  
The supplication of a dead ADC's hand  
Under the twinkle of a missing ping.  


Is it like this  
In Diamond+ ranks  
Waking alone  
While waiting for the ADC to respawn  
Trembling with tenderness  
Vaynes that would turret-dive  
Form full-health Blitzcranks to Zileans with Ult.   


IV  


The wards are not here  
There are no wards here  
In this valley of dying stars  
In this hollow valley  
This broken jaw of our lost LP  


In this last of meeting places   
The entire enemy team groups together  
And 5v2s us  
Gathered on this beach of this tumid river  


Sightless, unless  
Our support item upgrades  
As our Vayne  
AFK farms during my all-in  
We wait for her to scale  
The hope only  
Of empty men.   


V  


Here we go round the alcove wall  
Alcove wall alcove wall  
Here we go round the alcove wall  
At five o'clock in the morning.   


Between the idea  
And the reality  
Between the motion   
And the act  
Falls the Shadow  


9x report toxic Vayne   


Between the conception  
And the creation   
Between the emotion   
And the response  
Falls the Shadow  


Team is very heavy  


Between the desire  
And the spasm   
Between the potency  
And the existence  
Between the essence  
And the descent  
Falls the Shadow  


9x report toxic Vayne  


9x report  
Team is  
9x report toxic

fsed49,BulletCola,Which champion in Leauge is actually bad (Or OP) by design and not bad by numbers?,"I feel like this community has a tough time at knowing the difference between design and numbers which is.

Numbers: Basically stat stuff like damage, health, defense, cool down, speed and such. Shows that Champs have a change to be balanced due to this.

Characters that seem to be OP due to this are Sett and potentially Wukong.

——————————————————————

By Design: Basically means that no matter how heavy the nerfs or buffs are, they would still be in that one spot that makes them either overpowered or really bad. Mostly due to how their own kit works. The biggest recent example I can think of is maaaaaaaybe Yuumi.

Anyway are they’re really any champs that are truly OP by design? Because it seems like they’re mostly aren’t.",29,1585666715,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsed49/which_champion_in_leauge_is_actually_bad_or_op_by/,leagueoflegends,1

It was really annoying because I decided to just watch him, and that’s all he was doing. Is it normal during matches to just hide the whole game in the bushes?

fsd5yx,smelleke,The story how my mmr became tragic (pictures at the bottom),"Hello fellow summoners  


Last season I climbed from bronze 1 until gold 4. Once I reached gold 4 I decided it was high enough for season 9. The season had its ups and down, overall there were no problems. Now we have season 10. This is where my ranked experience went kinda downwards. I still enjoy the game, especially with a friend. However this post is going to be how I manage to get an MMR which is almost impossible to climb with. At the bottom of the post you can see my LP gain when I win and when I lose.   


Okay my season did not start all that great. Once the placements were done I ended up in silver 4. Okay not to bad, I can climp up to gold 4 again. Oh boy I was wrong about that. After my placements I went in a 13 loss streak in ranked. Don't get me wrong, it was not completely my own fault. As much effort was involved, the win was never mine. Of course some of them were not one of my best games. Yet a 13 lossstreak is not something to wish on someone. luckily, I couldn't derank since I just got the rank. yet this managed to completely flip my MMR in such a way I still have not been able to get a normal MMR. With this MMR I kept playing ranked, somehow I manage to get to gold 4. My old rank had finally been achieved, again. This period was not to bad luckily. For every lost game, I had to win 2 more games after that to neutralise the loss. Luckily both teams were not all to good so carrying was not a problem. Sometimes the games were not winnable in any way. People who managed to die twice every minute of the game. To be honest, we have all been in these types of games. Yes after a couple of games like this it became infurating. The real trigger point were the leavers. I got to the point where in the 13 lossstreak, 5 games in a row someone on my team left the game for some reason. That was just the streak, aside from the leaverstreak, 2 more people left. When I played around silver 4 to 1, I had players on my team which were bronse and once or twice iron. The enemy team was low silver and sometimes high bronse. Thus there was already a difference in team capabillity. I thought this was not the case anymore when I finally arrived in the gold elo. Again, how wrong could I be.  


now I most certainly have a negative winrate. This does not bother me at all, I just play it to have fun. somehow gold was achieved in one or two months. My rank does not bother me at all either, as long as I am in the correct rank where the games are close and exciting. Now it we arrive at the second part of my ranked adventure. Now I was gold 4, so a new start to my ranked experience. Nope it continued. As a gold player I played with brons people and facing silver and gold enemies. Again the skill from both the teams were so far apart. This is still due to my 13 game losstreak. Right now I am swinging between silver 1 and gold 4. To be perfectly honest, I had a couple of shitty games, however none of them were worthy to be said as inting. Went Heimer botlane and almost every game I had most damage from the games and least amount of deaths. Yet the amount of kills or assist were not that high. I tried to play jungle as well, some games went well, other games it felt like I was playing on top, mid and bot at the same time. When I had time, I grabbed what farm and an objective if I could. Most of the time the laners required assistance in their lane. Most games all laners lost their lane. Some of the games I did poorly myself. I think one game you could say I inted it a little. Everyone had that type of game. Nonetherless I went from silver 4 tot gold 4.... again..  Right now I am silver 4 and trying to get back up. This is basically the end of the story. I still struggle with the MMR and the difference in teamplay and individual skill between laners. Now I am praying to get a winstreak going to hopefully restore my MMR.   


Some side information: I play mostly ADC, sometimes I played support. There was a short period of time where I played jungle. I play on EUW and my name in league is smelleken, if you want you can check my profile on [OP.GG](https://OP.GG) :  [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=smelleken](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=smelleken).

Wukong is still broken even after being hotfix nerfed.  

Senna has been nerfed how many times now???

Aphelios nerfed how many times???

Akali nerfed how many times???

The list goes on and on I'd like to have a season where we don't need to deal with new OP bullshit for once.

So scrap the Fiddle rework and just make it a VGU and make all other reworks VGUs I'm in favor of doing VGUs especially for older champs but I could do without all the OP reworks that are clearly being released OP on purpose. 

 Seriously someone tell me the last time they released something that wasn't OP when it came out.  Yuumi wasn't weak it was just that players didn't figure out how to play her properly look what happened after they did, Garen Yuumi and other bullshit.

fscr0j,lightingbolt22,What if Yone Comes back as a Darkin?,"Okay, hear me out here. I know the theory that ""the masked demon"" is going to be Yone (Yasou's brother) is really popular, but I thought of a reason why it could actually make sense.

We hear in the [dev video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtmFFA0B30&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=252) that ""some *demons* should *remain in our past*"", which is accompanied by a red sword in the teaser. Perhaps Yone's body become possessed by a Darkin, and he started to take back control and could wear a mask because he's presumed dead/is half demon. We already know that Darkin can do things like extend/save lives, as Aatrox is like, really old and Varus is 1/3 half dead dude.

I think it'd be an awesome concept to bring Yone back as some corrupted zombie, using his unnatural powers to hunt down Yasuo, sort of like a vengeful spirit. Even if Yone himself doesn't want to, the Darkin could have corrupted his mind or something.

I'm really just spitballing here, but I'm pretty sure we need a 4th darkin anyways if the whole ""riders of the apocalypse"" theory is actually a thing.",20,1585660683,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fscr0j/what_if_yone_comes_back_as_a_darkin/,leagueoflegends,1

fsc7cl,exxxoo,Playing against smurfs every single game completely ruined my experience in competitive,"The title says it all. I'm a Plat 4 player (EUW) and I would like to climb, get better, have some fun. But it's impossible when you play against smurfs EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. A level 32 player, who is in silver 3 with 95% win rate in my game is obviously not a MOBA prodigy who just started playing the game and all the sudden is stomping everyone.

I know what you may say - You will encounter smurfs, it's normal, you can't escape it. And I agree. That's true. But when 80% of your games are decided by enemy players who are clearly on a MUCH higher level than you, then it's really difficult if not impossible to climb (or improve for that matter) or have fun in this game.

&amp;#x200B;

To all who tell me ""JuSt GeT gUd BruH"" - I want to. I want to improve, I want to get better. But when you get massively stomped by a master+ player in almost every single game you play, the experience is garbage.

fsc6o0,puellamagi11,Experience Of A Total Newbie,"So I was in a game wormhole, where I have nothing to do but dont want to play the current games i have either. I knew LoL for many years but didnt play it, those days best of the games were alive and running so I didnt start. However right now, it's quite the opposite. 

I checked the game, the champions are very unique and amazing. I loved them. I loved the design of the game too. But, I started playing. First match I had loads of unknown terms thrown at me. I understand nothing. There are 5 of the same item, I still understand nothing and get very confused. I dont have time to check everything and make sure everything's ok, they already have gone to fight. My teammates obviously have played this game before and have very good experience, I felt left out, a dead body they had to carry. The match ended, we won. I had quite fun moment if were not counting all the penta kills my teammate continously got and I hardly did anything. 

I searched the net to understand those terms and get very discouraged to play. Supports and ""ADC"" are always at the bottom? Tanks on top and assassins middle? Why? Why cant a tank and support go together on the mid or a mage and assassin cant go top? Why are we obligated to only play a lane? Isnt this a team based game? 

The next match people say stuff like ""newbies here (or something like that, the word confused me if they were talking about themselves or not)"" and people start saying ""same"". I feel like I'm being bullied, I hardly play the second match and at that time I'm filled up with confusion and discourage. I no longer want to play this game. It took 2 matches for me to get extremely unhappy. Why is it like this? I was really connected to the champions but I cant play. 

I also watched some LoL content and saw that they were literally all over the place but were together as a team. I'm extremely confused and discouraged. I'm not gonna talk about items. There are over a million items and I hardly know anything about them.",27,1585658344,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsc6o0/experience_of_a_total_newbie/,leagueoflegends,1

So there is something I wanted to bring up, which is queue preference in ranked games. I am a mid/supp main, and whenever I queue this way in ranked, I always get support- even if I place mid as my primary lane. I have tested this over my lsat 25 ranked games, and have only gotten mid lane once. 

This means, that if I ever want to play mid, I have to queue as mid / something else- which not only screws my team if I get the ""something else"", but also isn't indicative of what I actually want to play. 

If Riot wants support players to continue playing support, they shouldn't make anyone queuing as support secondary the same as only queuing support.

Make the login screen the same as the cinematic on the frame where fiddle stands still (where he screams HELP MEE!).

fsberz,Jayenty,Demons on Runeterra,"With Fiddle's rework, you probably notice that its interactions with demons are just... call the name and say a matching word. These are the demons:

Evelynn - Agony
Nocturne - Nightmares
Raum - Secrets
Tahn Kench - Addiction

Other interesting interaction is when it is walking:

Fiddlesticks
End of man
Fiddlesticks
First of ten

The last verse, First of ten, perhaps mean that it is the first out of 10 demons. And no, Darkins are not demons, they are a combine of Humans, Gods and Void. Demons are a species, not anyone who use corrupted magic. So, if Fiddle is the representation of the primal fear, the demons will be:

Fiddlestcks - Fear
Evelynn - Agony
Nocturne - Nightmares
Raum - Secrets
Tahn Kench - Addiction

Ah, if some of you don't know, Raum is the demonic hand Swain has. Anyways, there are still 5 demons to be created, but what is a demon?

A demon, in Runeterra, is a powerful entity with a primal desire of kill. Demons feed themselves with negative feelings (like Evelynn, that during the Runic Wars was eating agony from the survivors).

But now here comes a controversial part: Fiddlestcks doesn't have a phisical body, Nocturne has a ""semi-phisical"" body, Evelynn has a phisical body but can shapeshift, Tahn Kench... I think it can't shapeshift, or else it would choise a... a little closer to human body shape. And, about Raum, we don't know. So, there isn't a rule to how demons look like.

We also know that demons are imortal. Raum is now just a hand and it is still alive. Evelynn exists since the Runic wars, so it have almost a thousand years! And Fiddle exists since the concept of fear was created, in the very beggining of Runeterra!

Only 5 demons have been created so far, so let's see what Riot will do next. Some people believe that, after Aiydin, the next champion will be the Ruined King. Is that true? I don't know, but maybe a new demon can appear... We will have to wait...",13,1585654755,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsberz/demons_on_runeterra/,leagueoflegends,1

fsbd1w,blcksmell,"Are the ""Antimatter Chroma+icon"" bundles from the Galaxy shop actual skins you get or just Chromas that you need to buy the skin for in order to use?","So at first when I saw those bundles I thought its great, I already have about 250 tokens and its pretty easy to get and was happy to get a couple skins or something out of it, but then when I was playing with my friend and talked to him about the Galaxy shop and those 300 token skins he told me its just Chromas for which you would need to purchase the base Antimatter skin I guess?

This has happened to me so many too many times but none of them mattered because we would just switch roles but this time it was ranked and none of us could play ADC so i just decided to dodge because i was on 92lp anyways.

fsb0jx,ridller1231,"Report system in a nutshell, int and you are free to go, type ky$ and say bye to your account.(didnt type ky$, ITS JUST A MEME SNOWFLAKES SOORY)","I can agree im realy toxic, but the fact that someone can int someones game on purpose and not get banned is not in my minds capebilities to understand. My mentality is that you can mute someone who is being toxic by 1 push of a button but you cant mute a player intentionaly inting your game and ruining fun for 4 players ( could say all 9), even do i can accept the ban ,its just the chat, butt the fact the inter didnt get banned for the game is tilting me beyond the rift. Even the guy i was flaming said something like ;i dont care if you report me becuse riot cares only about money and wont ban inters; and lo ducking behold i get punished when someone who clearly was the reason for the toxicity prob keeps soft inting people games. This shit wont change in my opinion until riot realeases michraphone feature so those kids can understand that there are real humans on other end and owerwatch( like from cs go) to wiew cases and identify inting dogs like i said below.

On the ban i could argue that it was competitive talk, i was abusive on the fact that they trow and go ff 15 becuse they dont fell like it, becuse thats just pure int (even riot has a tip to play till end ,in loading screnn ,learn from the best) and i wasnt insulting the player for what kind of person he is but more on the gameplay element and i think this is not kindergarten that you cant call a player shit in ranked.

sory for abruptive sentences and bad grammar, i am  typing this in a rush cuz im slitly tilted and english is not my firrst language.

similar staff happens in ofa. theres like 3 or 4 ""play lux"" missions.   


so right now 2 things happen for me pretty much all the time.  


someone bans lux making other players troll.  


lux gets picked and ppl just afk ingame because they dont wanna play lux.   


either stop giving us missions that literally go ""do this and play that"" or give us 2 modes. one is called ""ofa - but with mission progress"" and the other is called ""ofa - without mission progress"" problem solved.

Since wukong is forced to stay in ult he will take alot more damge for a ""missed"" ult. So fighting him becomes easier but also requires you to predict his ult. And Wukong has to save his ult and use it wisely instead of just popping it and running at people with the increased movement speed.",13,1585651977,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsauhp/only_the_first_swing_of_wukongs_ult_should_knock/,leagueoflegends,1

fsaaoh,SuperRosca,Wukong is racist towards black brazilians,"Ok, this sounds weird, I get it, but hear me out:  


Wukong is a character ripped  from an ancient CHINESE legend, kung-fu even has a style dedicated to the Monkey King, the Hóu-Quán.   


So why does wukong dance capoeira instead of Hou-Quan ? A martial art that has been created by former slaves in Brazil, that to this day is still heavily associated with it's african roots.   


What makes things even worse is that calling a black person a ""monkey"" in Brazil would get you the same reaction as using the word N\*\*\*er in the US, making the fact that a literal monkey is performing capoeira - a style which he has absolutely no connection to- all the weirder.  


All that and I didn't even mention  the old xenophobic notion that all brazilians live in tree-tops, like monkeys.

fsa4ur,MalekTaktak,Add Gift Skin back to Post Game Screen for all servers,"It was such a neat feature where you could reward your teammates for playing well or BM a person by gifting them a troll skin.

Why was it removed? It's more RP spent and thus more money for Riot, did it make the client too buggy or did Riot just hate humanity's kindness? 

I've had someone add me and gift me RP after I carried them, but they had to wait a day in my friendslist making it less engaging for whoever wants to gift a person for a specific game.

fsa1xt,Royy212,Drakes should be visible in champ select.,"The 'new' changes to drakes added a lot more RNG and that's unhealthy for a competetive game. Especially since this season the drakes are even stronger, it's crucial for certain teamcomps to know which drake is going to come up.

By showing drakes beforehand, you make it possible for teams to adapt to the situation instead of making it a coin flip. You could say, just adapt in-game to the situation, but now certain drakes could have a very hard impact on certain champs/comps and that's all randomized, no player input whatsoever. E.g. if you would pick a poke comp (which is way to risky) and the ocean soul spawns, you're pretty much doomed if you don't take the drakes.",14,1585647761,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fsa1xt/drakes_should_be_visible_in_champ_select/,leagueoflegends,1

fs9sqm,carderkitten,The cruelty of League of Legends Gaming Community," So a lot of things in The Gaming Community you're already pretty depressing, but it is pretty awful when I begged and pleaded for several games of repeatedly. If we could play Yuumi, been trying all day to get the champion. Reason for wanting to play it even though the likelihood of losing is because, a friend of mine who is very sick wanted to watch me play it. They will not be able to watch me play once they're in the hospital permanently. Their conditions are slowly getting worse and they are no longer going to be able to breathe without ventilation treatment. Tonight was my absolutely last chance to get the champion in all for one to play it for them. No matter how much I begged and pleaded the community continue to call me a liar. And was not even willing to try, repeatedly they banned the champion, and told me to go die along with a lot of other things. The Gaming Community is extremely heartless. They would rather tell themselves that a person is lying even though they have someone typing to them begging and pleading I did this for over a hundred games or so it felt like I'm not exactly sure how many. All it says about the gaming community and people on the internet though and days is that they are horrible. It's actually quite sad that I could literally type in could we please play this Champion I only want to play it for one game because I'd like to play it for a friend of mine who is very sick.

fs95wy,Leona_Zeona,I feel kinda stuck,"Currently sitting gold 2 and main adc and supp (More adc). Main issue I am having atm is just not feeling like I'm able to make much impact at times. Perhaps just rusty from having not played much recently due to having to work during all this mayhem.

But anyway, I'm just not sure if I might have better luck trying to just brute force my way with my main MF as adc or just try and do things as Leona in support. Or even move to another role? It often feels like a coinflip on the other person in bot lane, like getting an over-aggressive soraka or a sit behind tower passive puke. Or the classic wannabe gosu vayne.

I'm fine to take the backseat in a game and let the other lanes do things if I can't manage a big lead in lane, I just try to aim to not die to much. but then I see things like mid is 0/10 by 10 min in and just feel like I'm boned. Yes I know I have bad games, I know I can be the cause of a loss at times, so its not a case of whiny adc thinks they perfect. 

Of course no matter what happens in the other lanes everyone just blames bot lane for everything even if neither bot lane took part in anything else that happened in the other lanes.

Long ramble aside, I just can't really decide what to do to try and climb. Perhaps I can try looking for a duo partner so that I at least know what the other person down bot is thinking.",3,1585642875,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs95wy/i_feel_kinda_stuck/,leagueoflegends,1

fs93mp,Ainychus,"Please, know what a bad game really looks like!","I'm an Aurelion Sol one trick. I am comfortable playing Sol into every matchup, although some are hard are require you to lose out on lots of farm, nothing is unwinnable as you scale. 

My friend is a mid main, so I have to take Sol elsewhere when I play with him. I used to take him jungle, but they kinda killed Sol jungle so now I mainly play him toplane. Toplane Sol doesn't have a huge amount of bad matchups. You take phase rush and generally the annoying champions of toplane like Sett, Darius and Garen can't catch you, and you outscale them. 

Well this game I was up against Rengar top. Obviously a disgusting matchup for Sol which I will autolose. My support also was threatening to troll if I didn't pick Sol top for some reason. So, reluctantly, I locked it in and prepared for a laning phase full of pain. Taking all the defensive runes in the world wasn't gonna help.

Laning phase as brutal, as expected, the rengar was also a smurf on a new Lvl 30 account, and I was getting camped super hard by the enemy jg. It was frustrating but I can deal with this. Their team was mainly assassins that don't scale, I think their team was thresh, kata, rengar, yi and I can't remember their adc. Our team was sol, trundle, yasuo, sivir and soraka. Hey, imma call winnable.

So 11 minutes in I'm understandably down lots of farm and levels but have I given up or tilted? Hell no. Rengar inted to kill me for the 3rd time while giving me a shutdown bounty, so I'm thinking we got this. Our team has a lot of waveclear, we can just push minions and allow our carries to scale up, I can do what Sol does best and protect my three carries with Sol's crazy cc.

My team doesnt feel the same way though. I'm being spam pinged like crazy at this point. ""Nice pick"" and ""top gap"" has started coming up in chat, they are pinging the level difference and calling to report me for feeding. (I was 1/3 at 11 minutes by the way, while botlane was 0/6, so idk how that translates.)

I told em hey, I was having a bad game and I was doing my best. Unlike them, I was itemizing properly to survive my lane, got double dorans early for some hp, grabbed a seekers armguard too. Then the sivir says this absolute nonsense.

""there's a difference between having a bad game, and going 1-3 in 5 minutes.""

First off. what? Second off. It was 11 minutes in. I had died like once or twice by 5 minutes. I was just having a straight up bad time with being in possibly the hardest matchup of any champion in the whole game (okay maybe that's a little exaggerated, but I implore you to play sol into rengar top and feel how much pain it brings)  and also having the enemy jg putting a tent in my lane. I can't farm, because in order to farm without rengar jumping on me, I need to stand at the edge of the river. That is basically putting a sign on my back saying ""yes please gank me"". And then even if I'm away from bushes rengar can just walk into the river bush, or just walk up and empowered ebola me, it's just rough.

That game was particularly disheartening because once people start tilting, it's lost. We lost a game we could've and should've won because of how cocky the enemy team was playing, at one point our yasuo was fed a free triple kill, two of those kills were big shutdowns. but because botlane wanted to spend more time typing and flaming, we lost. 

Morale of the story? Don't get so tilted when you open tab and see your team is losing. Doesn't mean the game's over and doesn't mean you should build hextech gunblade and rageblade on tristana. (Yeah that happened the very next game and I'm still salty. We wouldve won the game but tristana refused to build proper items.)",4,1585642515,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs93mp/please_know_what_a_bad_game_really_looks_like/,leagueoflegends,1

fs8zqa,IcyColdStare,Free Talk Tuesday - March 31st!,"What's up, /r/leagueoflegends! IcyColdStare back with this week's edition of our Free Talk thread. Hope you've all had a great weekend!

Fiddle's rework is slated to hit Live in just a few hours! The Ancient Fear's got a fresh new look, a creepy new VO and the O M N I S U C C to keep you going in that lonely jungle (or for you true psychopaths out there, middle lane). Some even say the Dread Lord Fiddle has somehow made their appearance on the Rift already...if so, beware. That's not just a regular scarecrow....

Speaking of scary stuff, tomorrow's April 1st! That's all.

That's it from yours truly for this week. Please do remember that while off-League talk is welcome here, regular League stuff is, too! And with that, I'll ask you all to keep to our regular FTT rules: talk shop, play nice and as always, [have a good week!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FeokU5sZME)

fs8yxs,yellowdaysss,Season 5-10 Player; Thinking on quitting. (Want to heat some input),"So I've been playing since Season 5. I'm a Kassadin &amp; Talon main. I have only ever peaked at Diamond 3. I never played the game for a longer duration of a continuous 3-4 months. Within that time I was able to climb pretty quickly &amp; hit D5/Plat1-2. I have found that I don't have a desire to climb this season. The game isn't the same anymore, it doesn't feel like so. Even at Plat &amp; Diamond elo.. the community there is almost very new &amp; just recently got into the game (2-3 years). The meta shifting every month is also annoying.. it makes it impossible to improve a particular play style and forces you to adjust.

I just got offline after a really bad streak of bad games that honestly tilted me moreso because of the internet I play with (60ms // spikes to 80-135 every couple minutes).

I know what I want to do but I just wanted to see if anyone here had some input that's further influence my decision into 'execution' base.

fs8mc8,ripawinakatawina,"Conqueror should be nerfed, not assassins","I see a lot of people complaining about Katarina. Have you seen that people with high winrates **ONLY** use Conqueror? Before Conqueror's rework, Katarina was fine. This topic is mostly about Kat, but concerns other assassins too.

Did anyone complain this much about those champions before their mains started using Conqueror?

I don't think so.

Seriously. Kat's winratio has increased ever since they created that rune. Since then, assassins have received a lot of aggro from the community for being OP (in other words, insane healing and sustain), complaints and pleas for nerfs when in fact, what they should nerf/remove is Conqueror. It's the crazy healing that makes those assassins so OP.

To all non-kat mains: Katarina isn't broken. It's her interaction with Conqueror that is. So please, **stop** saying that Katarina should be nerfed. I mean, Gunblade + Death's Dance (now reworked) + Ravenous Hunter + Conqueror? Isn't that what's broken, rather than Katarina herself?

If they nerf Katarina in the following patches, then Conqueror will remain the **only viable rune** for her if you think about it. This proves my point that Katarina **isn't** the problem.

If she is so broken, then why have some Kat otp mains quit playing when they went on pro-play? **Katarina is simply predictable.** Bunch of careless players step on her daggers, die, feed and complain about  her winrate.

Like come on, for the last 3-4 years she has only received nerfs. The only times she's become stronger is because of a rune change or an item change.

The problems with this rune don't end with Katarina. Talon's and Akali's winrates have also gone up because of that rune and the amount of sustain it offers them. And guess what? Those champs received nerfs. Irelia, Yasuo, all the bruisers basically pick this rune since there is no other viable rune for them. EVEN MAGES like Ryze and Cassiopea prefer Conqueror because of how much it makes other runes irrelevant.

**Customization has become a myth since the most recent rework of Conqueror was released.**

I hate being forced to pick mainstream Conqueror, when in fact, I prefer the Electrocute/DH playstyles, but I know that they're barely even meta anymore. I don't know if anybody has noticed, but half the players in every single game use this rune.

Every Kat/Talon OTPs spam Conqueror because they know it will give them the Tenacity buff (so CC is no longer a problem), then manage to kill at least 3 people without dying due to the healing. Then people say ""omg why are the winrates so high.""

I hope everyone looks at the bigger picture here, and not zoom in on one or two champions for nerfs. Even after Katarina and Talon get nerfed, the Conqueror problem **WON'T** be solved.",30,1585639969,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs8mc8/conqueror_should_be_nerfed_not_assassins/,leagueoflegends,1

I've watched the pro play from season 2 on, the highlight of casting (which imo) was season 3-6. Joe ""Please don't call me Joe Miller, just call me Joe"" Miller hype.

I tried to come back to playing but my god. The game feels old, attack move on left click, which is now a feature, is still fucked up. If you click on items, or really anything your character still ignores the item screen and moves wherever you clicked. Start of the game select your items? Better do it before the barrier is down or you might run to bot lane if your jungle/mid/top. How can you have a toggle switch for left mouse click to be attack move yet still fuck things up in menu selection? It still feels like a half assed feature that people have been using since season 3.

I haven't reliably played since season 5ish yet the client lags horrendously, the client feels more like an apparatus to sell you things rather than to help you look at anything relevant.  In 30 or so some odd games I found out you can only earn one chest per week for an S tier rating. I used to put money into this game because I enjoyed it now I would be hard pressed to give this company money if my mother was in a torture chamber and I could only free her by paying money to this shit company.

In game i get consistent, reliable lag spikes. None of which I see in WoW, AoE2, Divinity, Total war, or Diablo 2. Like wtf this game seems to be in worse shape than it was when I left it, in terms of online reliablity.

So, how long have you played? Honestly I feel like the game as a whole was more reliable in season 3 than is now. 

I do like most the character changes however.

Alright so, I've definitely had days where I probably int more than I should, I NEVER afk, or run it down, (probably the worst kind imo) not that that really matters here, ok now to my case.  


I was perma banned, and recently I was 2 week banned for being ""toxic"" honestly, it was simple banter, and well oh well (I'd be willing to post the chat logs for that).   
I was laning vs a Yasuo, I pinged my jungle to come help, anyway I said, that. The most toxic thing that game I said was if I die again I'll afk, (just me being mad) I'd never actually afk. So maybe that is toxic?   
I said I thought my jungle was coming (they pinged), which is whatever.   


I ask my Rene why he is building Armor vs a Teemo top (he he is 0-1 at this point, I am 0-2)  he points out my 0-2. He dies again, I said ""oh 0-2"" What does he do? ints, runs it down mid the rest of the game feeding my Yasuo, he leaves the game after about 20mins or so 0-16.   


I do say something along the lines of ""that;s some mental you got"" or something, imo not toxic, I was being literal, since he was inting. Anyway I'll probably edit this post with a VoD of what happened if anyone is interested.   


P.S I did say sorry to my jungle for ""blaming"" him for my death. (clearly my fault I wasn't looking).

&amp;#x200B;

Every single champion in the game benefits  from MS. Not all champions  benefits from mana...It sucks for me to waste gold on this stats.

I know they gave 10% CDR to the item too...but anyways.

She's able to one shot but also to poke, and with glacial augment she also gives A LOT utility to her team

fs7wsy,Jukenut,Garena is borderline unplayable.,"This is something of a cry fot help. We SEA players have literally no where else to play with decent ping and we are stuck in this hell hole.

Let me break it down to you guys whats its like playing in this region.

Silver-plat. Games here are littered with the toxic shitbags. I mean, the people there will make euw kids cry from the toxicity. Full of smurfs (i get to why later) and kids who afks or write essays the second things go wrongs. Usually the smurfs afks because they have 3+ accounts.

Dia+ it gets worse here. The toxicity isnt as bad (2/10 games u get afks). But the worst part is the queue times. U get 10 mins queues and the tank disparity is insane. 

You get teamed up or vs masters/gms/challengers regularly and the challenger s themselves are god awful because they are so used to playing with diamonds (i got a few games where there is a challenger in one team and a gold 1 in another). Pathetic. 

Autofilled is also rampant in higher elos since no one plays support. 8/10 times when i m not autofilled protected, i get autofilled into support.

The queue times are almost unberable so people just make new accounts to prevent the horrid queue times. To give you perpective, once you get diamond, say good bye to queue times. Migjt as well watch netflix whike you wait oin queue, or better yet, just create a new account",4,1585636314,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs7wsy/garena_is_borderline_unplayable/,leagueoflegends,1

Game was okay, but being the skin freak I am I wanted to see how their skins and shop was and let me tell you that sht is 100x better then what we call a shop now.

1) each skin has their own bio/ story bit
2) Training, ability to test the skin out on a single target dummy
3)Custom builds by other player
4)promo esq video
5) information on what was done to the skin ie Q animation added or changed 

Like what! How do we need even have this in our shop all we have is a basic bio and skins and that’s it!!!!!! Everything they have is integrated to their shop while ours we have to go onto a website to even see a lore for a skin and that is if it even has any lore to begin with.

fs6w8m,enlighten2011,More Hints at New Champion,"Visiting the [map of Runeterra](https://map.leagueoflegends.com/en_US) we see the area mentioned by The Guide's voice lines: Ghulfrost. This is where Ashe found her bow.

In the pictures we see Ashe standing on ice that encases multiple corpses. The bodies in the ice wear armor so it makes sense that these are the the people who participated in the war of three sisters that he mentions.

Zooming out, we see Rakelstake, the sacred site where Tryndamere and Ashe were oath-bound. The map reads, "" \[Ashe\] has allowed her followers to honor her by making pilgrimages to the sacred site of Rakelstake."" 

Ghulfrost lies directly on the path from Ashe's home, the Avarosan village of  Vathcaer, to Rakelstake. So, I believe The Guide watches over those Avarosans who would undertake the pilgrimage to to Rakelstake. Most likely, he is an amalgam of souls who have either died along the way, or undertook some sort of sacred rite.

We don't have anything to go off of mechanically, but I think he will be able to interact with terrain in some way since he has ice picks. This might be a stretch but, he might even have abilities modeled after Smash's Ice Climbers.

i do like playing mechanical champions, but due to my own inconsistency with these champions and lack of persistence, I’ve since decided to play champions that aren’t necessarily braindead, but don’t require the most efforts (since it’s mostly unnecessary at my elo). therefore, at the moment i find myself playing Kassadin and Diana most, and am wondering if Fizz fits this criteria and can help me climb.

thanks!",7,1585629407,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs6hhj/is_fizz_hard_to_play/,leagueoflegends,1

fs6a6o,BackupWeeWooWagon,Jax Thoughts?,"Hey everyone,

So I’ve been playing league for about 5 years now and I’m wondering if Jax’s AP based scaling bothers anyone else in the community. Specifically, his W and the passive AP damage from his R. 

Thematically, they don’t suit his title of “Grandmaster at Arms.” Why does his lamppost do any magic damage at all? The only major purpose of the lamppost from what I can remember is his way of proving his title. He doesn’t need a real weapon to prove his skill in battle.

In terms of gameplay, it’s frustrating to play a tank that’s building armor and anti-auto attack items only to see that my health is still getting shredded.

And then on top of that, I think Jax could use a visual update. With reworks like Fiddlesticks and Aatrox, their auto-attacks feel unique to their character. Aatrox’s attacks make him seem like a skilled swordsman. Fiddlesticks has a demonic (tendril? Arm?) throwing his bolts of energy. Jax just seems like someone smacking things with a stick. There’s nothing in his auto-attacks that make him seem like a true Grandmaster at Arms.

What’re everyone else’s thoughts on this?",14,1585628497,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs6a6o/jax_thoughts/,leagueoflegends,1

Not a free jump, but an Irellia or a Yasuo jump, requiring a kill in order to reset the jump. This way you can dunk your minions as you chase down your enemy, and still keeping the true spirit of league by encouraging high risk, high reward, flashy gameplay with tons-of-damage. 

Giving him a leap will also encourage Darius to take teleport over ghost so that rather than only making one person miserable for 12 straight minutes as they have a nervous breakdown trying to decide if it worth losing 3/4 of their health for a  caster minion, Darius can now dunk low-health minions over to his enemy laner, score the kill, and tp down to bot where the jungle Wu-Kong can ult the bot lane 3x and ks after leaving you by yourself after you did all the work.",5,1585627855,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs652s/darius_needs_a_leap_other_than_his_ult/,leagueoflegends,1
fs61rf,Mammoth_Dog,Cinderhulk should give a larger flat amount of HP instead of the % bonus and that should go to Warmog's instead.,"The idea of an item with a % HP bonus is cool but it doesn't belong on an item that many are forced to build first. We should be able to build flat health in the early game and get the scaling bonus later when it actually means something. Warmog's is the perfect candidate for a scaling health item, and doing so would keep in tact the cinderhulk, Warmog's, stoneplate build that some tanks (Sejuani) rely on, and also make the item more viable on tank laners.

Doing so would obviously be a buff early and nerf later to tank junglers, although there would be the option to build Warmog's to make up for the lack of scaling.

Moreso than that, it would create build diversity. Currently we are forced to build at least two health items after cinderhulk to make the bonus actually worth the gold we spent on it. This would make it so that items like thornmail, frozen heart, IBG, stoneplate, locket, all those that give resistances but little to no HP, would be viable second items.",3,1585627469,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs61rf/cinderhulk_should_give_a_larger_flat_amount_of_hp/,leagueoflegends,1

It seems like for the most part, whomever can get their GP or MF to ult first will win the match. They don't even need to have items, and will usually lead the round in damage dealt. The only way to really stop them is with CC, and that can be countered by building the standard Quicksilver  or Trap Claw.

I win some, and lose some, and still struggling to climb out from Low ILO, how did you guys managed to climb onto the higher ranks in RANK games?

fs4hto,YumaS2Astral,"Hextech Gunblade should be separated into two different items: One for AP assassins, and one for hybrid champions","One of Hextech Gunblade's main problems is that it is trying to be both an item for AP assassins (due to its active that scales with AP, as well as the high amount of AP) and an item for hybrid champions that want sustain (as seen with its omnivamp passive and the fact that it has both AD and AP).

Unfortunately this item is not actually interesting for the majority of AP assassins, as well as hybrid champions, because it is either too expensive for them, has wasted stats for them, or they have cheaper or more stat effective items that achieve a similar purpose. For example, Hextech Gunblade seems like an interesting item for Jax, until you realize he can buy Death's Dance, which achieves the same purpose as Hextech Gunblade (gives the same amount of omnivamp), and has another amazing passive (damage delaying). Jax doesn't need Gunblade's active since he is not an AP assassin and, while the AP is interesting (his W and his ult passive work surprisingly well with AP), because this item has double the AP it has over AD, it mess up with Jax's adaptive runes. Jax wants AD more than he wants AD, but this item makes his adaptive runes give AP, which he dislikes.

The exception of champions that buy this are Akali and Katarina. This is because they happen to be AP assassins, yet they also have hybrid scalings. As such, they are the only champions aside from Kayle that make extremely good use of this item. Kayle also builds this because, though not an AP assassin, she stacks AP and wants this item's omnivamp.

I had two ideas for new items in that this could be separated:

* **The Witch's Duskwand**
* Stats: 100 ability power, 10% cooldown reduction
* Recipe: Needlessly Large Rode + Fiendish Codex + 1050 gold (total: 3200 gold)
* Unique ACTIVE: During 10 seconds your champion gains *NIGHTSTALKER*. 40 seconds cooldown.
* Unique PASSIVE - *NIGHTSTALKER*: After using a dash or blink, or exiting from stealth, your next basic attack or ability is empowered to deal 175 − 253 (based on level) (+ 30% AP) and slow the target by 40% for 2 seconds. This can only happen once every 10 seconds. If you get a takedown after using this empowered attack or ability, your champion restores 15% of its missing health, mana, and energy.

Explanation: This is the AP assassin item. It deals the same amount of damage as Hextech Gunblade currently does, but it is slighty different. This item is much more cost efficient for AP assassins, and for AP champions in general. Because of this, I have modified the active to have synergy with mobility/stealth, so that this item isn't abused by mages, and we don't have the same problem as Deathfire Grasp used to have (transforming every AP champion into an AP assassin). Indeed, if you notice, this item has the same buildpath, a similar cost (only 200 gold more expensive), and a very similar active to Deathfire Grasp. It is now a viable option for champs like Fizz, Evelynn, and LeBlanc which, despite being able to technically buy Hextech Gunblade, don't buy it because it is too expensive and has wasted stats for them (namely, the AD). The other passive (health and resources restoring) was added to compensate for this item not having omnivamp. If the AP assassin manages to get a takedown, he is rewarded by getting a bit of his health back, as well as the resources he wasted to get the takedown. The ""this can only happen once every 10 seconds"" part is so that it isn't abused if the champion happens to have multiple dashes.

* **The Enlightened Khakkhara**
* Stats: 65 attack damage, 65 ability power, 10% cooldown reduction
* Recipe: Vampiric Scepter + Caulfield's Warhammer + Blasting Wand + 250 gold (total: 3100 gold)
* Unique PASSIVE: Heals for 18% of all damage dealt. Area of effect and pets damage only heals 6% for every unit affected.
* Unique PASSIVE: Basic attacks and abilities deal 10 magic damage on-hit, and heals for the that damage dealt.

Explanation: This is the hybrid sustain item. It heals for a similar amount as Hextech Gunblade currently does, and also works on every type of damage, doesn't matter if it is physical, magic, or true. Doesn't matter if it is ability damage, damage from autos, items, on-hit effects. It also works on AoE damage, although at a reduced amount. It lacks attack speed, so that this item is a viable choice for possible hybrid champions that do not care about attack speed (such as Akali). It has an equal amount of AD and AP, so that it doesn't mess up with hybrid champion's adaptive stats (a Jax that build this will still have AD as their preferred adaptive stat, assuming they don't have more AP than AD). If you notice, even its components have an equal amount of AD and AP, assuming you build them together. It also has some cooldown reduction, something that is extremely lacking in hybrid itemization. The on-hit damage/healing is so that hybrid on-hit champions such as Jax, Kog'Maw, and Varus, have an extra incentive to build this. Could be removed if proven to be too powerful.",11,1585621076,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs4hto/hextech_gunblade_should_be_separated_into_two/,leagueoflegends,1

fs4gsz,tempermentaltyrant-,i don’t know what champion to play anymore..,"hello r/leagueoflegends,

i love League of Legends - like a lot. but i’m currently in the worst frame of mind i’ve been in since starting to play mid-season 9. 

with that, i’ve played for roughly 8 months. across the entirety of my time on this game, i have never focused on playing a single champ or a single role for too long before becoming frustrated. i’ve gone from Top, to ADC (where i stayed for a while until they nerfed Kai’Sa and Aphelios after that), and now to the Mid lane. 

note: i’m Silver 3.

Mid-lane is my favourite lane of all time, so i am fairly sure this is the role i’m staying for good in. my problem now is sticking to a champion. i’ve has success on some of my favourite champions, Ekko and Sylas especially, but have then gone into a pitiful slump where it seems like all of my knowledge of the game and the champion has gone out the window, and i begin to play terribly on them. 

this kind of thing happens all the time, and makes me instantly drop the champion, feel frustrated and lost in this game. so i turn to play some of the easier champs like Diana, and have strong games with her, but because i get bored of these easier champs quickly, and my success with them makes me think i can pick up a more mechanical champion again, i’ll drop her too and go back to Sylas etc.

i really want to improve in this game. i know all of the basic mechanics of the game and the champions, but i cannot for the life of me stick to one champion and play them until i have consistent success and can begin to effectively climb with them. i love champions like Ekko, Sylas and even Diana (despite her boring me after a couple games), but after a few days of playing against obviously better players who HAVE played a lot of their champion, i drop them and tell myself i shouldn’t be playing mechanical champions; so i go back to easy champs, play well and go back to mechanical champions - it’s a vicious cycle. 

how did you guys find that champion you wanted to play with forever? and how did you go on to play consistently and not have 5 good games then 20 bad ones?

i’m lost, this kind of mindset is making me lose interest in a game i love a lot. please help.

While you can certainly win with them if you have a few in lvl 3 and with the right items, it seems as though having a tier 5 would take it over the edge.

fs41dq,Thegg11,0/5 in 10 minute Akalis and New Player Yi. But elo hell doesn't exist.,"So, if every game ends up with either someone hard inting a lane to the point that we just lose, or a new player who has no place in ranked and hard ints the entire game for us, how are we expected to climb? The only redeeming quality is that I get to flame both for their shit play and being enough of an asshole to queue ranked at level 30 for your second ranked game, after the first game where you went 0/9, in what world do you expect that ranked is for you after that? Is there even a point to caring about ranked and not hard throwing when you get games like that? The Yi will get to int unpunished far longer then I would get to flame him for? Why shouldn't I just pretend to be bad like the Yi?

Chances are the majority areelo boosting in low elo euw right now, you can check each profile after every game and you’ll find at least one elo boost or a smurf account. 

Games heavily rely on those factors, then comes you who’s trying to improve gradually but it’s impossible under these conditions, therefore all your games are coin flips and you can’t improve. You can go 15/0 but your top laner could be someone who doesn’t care much to win because he’s unranked and opened top lane by 10 minutes but Riot decided it’s fair to match you together because of lack in players, or you can play vs a smurf account/elo booster and all your effort goes to waste.

fs3mkn,CMCI_69,Quality of matchmaking needs to be addressed.," Sorry for the shit post but if this isn't the correct place someone please point me in the right direction :)

I am either the most unlucky person ever or this is the state matchmaking is in. I have played my fair share of games today as I am sure most of you have during Covid-19 season. Today I must of played over 15 games (way too many I know) and have won 3 of them. Every game I lost was due to someone giving up and intentionally feeding the enemy team or someone leaving the game entirely. Every. Single. Game. Unfortunately getting all of my team and the enemy team to report them hasn't achieved much as at no point today have I received a message saying that they have been reprimanded or I have had a loss prevention. I can't gain LP or enjoy my time in Solo / Duo at all. It seems to me that being called a name online is prioritised over the nature and game play experience for the majority of people. It is not just me either, I have seen plenty of other games ruined by this too. Side note, if I cannot queue with a bronze player, why are they in my gold games?

Here is the screenshot of the worst two. They flamed the whole team for 4 minutes then left the game, leaving us no choice but to sit their and watch the enemy team storm our base. Completely unfair if you ask me.

Its been an year and 3 months now since i got perma banned on this account, i still cant get the fact that i got permabanned, and people that are playing the game with way more toxicity are still in it with main accounts. i spent all my night and days in this account, if levels above 30 were back in season 7 i would probably be like level 800 now. i spent more than 200$ of my own earnings ( was 16 back then) and i had so much playing the game even that i was bronze, because what i had there i figured, was fun with my big mistakes, not was not about lost LP. i made so much mistakes in past and im going to psychotherapist right now and i can say that im a whole new person. My brother has aggresion problems in the game still, and im helping him out and trying him to dodge places where i made mistakes so i dont let him suffer like i did. i dont flame people anymore, i realize that everyone have bad games, and that LP and games LOSE AND WIN which was most important thing i didnt know as a 16 dumb kid. after this account got banned i got into more problems, like my family end, (divorce of my parents) which hit me very hard, same as my oldest brother diagnosed with lung cancer, and had very strong stress and depression over school, leading to hard toxicity at the beggining of the season 9, i was actualy asking myself things i never did: how do bad things only happen to me? or am i unluckiest guy on the planet? but the thing i learned from it is that time heals all, i maybe sound like very strange person but i really need to get some things of my chest, to feel better about myself knowing i said it finally. Know my life and other things changed, and i know about myself better, feeling good and knowing i can prove you guys that i CHAGNGED. if you can ust unban me, i will never write any type of harm or insult to anybody or even, i will not even use chat and /muteall everytime, cause i dont want any harm or bad to happen to anyone because i know what is the feeling. i know that i look sketchy, i really do because there are people just trying to troll and scam to get unbanned or refunded and that type of actions but im not going for that. if i type ANY time of harm ANYTIME ANYMORE freely be sure to IP/indefinite ban me. i hope you guys have understanding and that you are not some guy that is on his place in the company for no reason.

fs3102,Pohji1,Team Liquid should not have been an original franchised LCS team,"I have thought this since it first happened, but given how this split went I feel that I can say this without being immediately dismissed.  Back in the day, the top 8 teams got to return in the following split, while the bottom 2 teams would be relegated.  Summer 2017 split was the final split that would have relegation tournaments, after which the teams in LCS would be (more or less) set. Liquid really struggled that split.  Towards the end of the split, Liquid got Doublelift who was contracted with TSM essentially as a rental, and they managed to place 9th.  Then, he remained for the promotion tournament and helped to keep TL in the LCS before returning to TSM the following split.

This situation always bothered me.  It felt to me that it was an unfair bias to TL and a way to increase the odds of them remaining in LCS during arguably one of the most important splits to do so.  I would have no complaint if they fought through the tournament with the roster they had through the split, but getting Doublelift as a clutch player didn't seem fair to me, especially to the others fighting for the spot in the promotion tournament.  

I am a huge fan of NA in international tournaments and have rooting for TL whenever they play abroad, but I am also a believer in fairness, and while TL technically did nothing wrong, it just never felt right to me, and it is very possible that another team could have been in the LCS today.

Of course, there could be some information I don't know or I am remembering incorrectly, and if that is the case, please correct me.",6,1585615442,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs3102/team_liquid_should_not_have_been_an_original/,leagueoflegends,1

I am currently in gold 2 (was platinum in previous seasons) so I could be playing like a bronze player too, I’ve seen bronze players with good cs so I couldn’t be different.",9,1585615196,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs2ygc/i_genuinely_want_to_know_the_difference_between/,leagueoflegends,1
fs2ydp,CMCI_69,Someone needs to address matchmaking.,"I don't know what else to say about matchmaking. Maybe I am just the most unlucky person on the planet. Obviously I have played my fair share of LoL today as most of you have during Covid-19 season. Probably around 16 games, I have won 2 of them. I have lost every single game due to someone on my team intentionally feeding. Not because they are having a bad game. Literally running it down and flaming everyone on the team. These two in particular, left at 4 minutes into the game because they ""couldn't be bothered"". All the reports me and others have made will do nothing to these guys because being called a name online is apparently prioritised over the nature and quality of game play.

fs2v1x,lipboi,Weird interaction with Graves W and Elise's Rappel that shouldn't happen. Q,"When Graves uses his smokescreen (W), and Elise uses her spider form Rappel (E), she goes un-targetable by spranging up into the air for a few seconds. But she is still affected by his W's vision loss. Elise E also gives vision of the area for the duration of her E. 

Graves W only affects units vision when they are inside of the ring, so how can a champion that is un-targetable still be affected by this. Her E is like Zed's R or Master Yi's Q, which mean she vanishes cannot be targeted by anything, her model isn't on the map therefore graves' W is on the map and Elise isn't so she shouldn't be affected by it until she comes back down into the W.",17,1585614854,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs2v1x/weird_interaction_with_graves_w_and_elises_rappel/,leagueoflegends,1
fs2u1g,Debonaircorgi,Fiddlesticks - Missed out,"First off, I love the new fiddle rework, looks creepy as hell! The concept is amazing and Riot really went for that horror theme! But I cant help but feel like they really missed out on some great potential for the voice over. To start, I do like the overall idea: give him a creepy and unique voice that sets him apart from the other demonic characters (Nocturne, Hecarim, Aatrox the Voidies) and to an extent it worked well. However, it feels dry and less intimidating the more you listen to it.

Fiddlesticks' primary idea for his character is that he's able to mimic things he hears, and in the trailer it gave the impression that he can imitate their actual voice to some extent. I dont know how difficult it would be to incorporate this (I cant imagine any more so than normal voice overs), but it would have been much creepier if they could mix in a bit of some of the characters voices when he mimics their phrases! Not a large amount of their voices, but maybe little tones that match up to really give us that feel of this evil entity taunting us while it hunts us down!

Along those lines, I feel like they over played the ""grampa needs his inhaler"" voice. Overall it is impressionable and creepy, but I think they forgot to play off his demonic side and it ends up feeling monotoned. I think that the voice over's golden moments are when fiddlesticks gets excited and the pitch heightens, it makes it more intimidating and frenzied, which is what he needs. Again I dont know how difficult it would be to program this, but if they could maybe make his voices increase in pitch when he starts moving towards a champ with lower health to give the feel that he's excitedly chasing down a kill! Furthermore, I think adding in more of the deep demonic voice really gives him the range he needs to be frightening. The contrast of raspy to high pitch to deep and sinister really brings the character to life in a phenomenal way, but they didnt do the best job bringing that out.

Overall, I'm hella excited about the rework and the visuals are spot on, excellent job Rito!",1,1585614749,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs2u1g/fiddlesticks_missed_out/,leagueoflegends,1

fs2sx1,TheRaymanH,LOL Champion Concept: Catniss; The Noxus' Claws,"Another old champion concept from the lol forums before closing. Now a vastayan from Noxus.

Name: Catniss

Role: Assassin

Type of Attack: Melee

lane / Pos: Jungle

Resource: Mana

Region: Noxus (Formerly Ionia)

&amp;#x200B;

**Statistics Level 1**

\- Life: 568 +44

\- Mana: 425 +25

\- Attack damage: 37.5 + 3.6

\- Attack speed: 0.451

\-Movement speed: 365

\-Health regeneration: + 2.5s

\-Mana regeneration: + 1.5s

\-Armor: 33

\-Magic resistance: 39

\-Range: 146

&amp;#x200B;

**Appearance and personality**: Catniss is a cat-looking Vastaya; identifying features are short shoulder length brown hair, purple eyes, very pointed cat ears, long tail and claws on its hands and feet / paws. Her skin tone is light tan and she has no hair on it; only on the ears and tail. Dressed, she wears Noxian combat armor designed for her to do damage with the claws of her paws, filled with metal plates that protect her from damage. Her personality is light-hearted and quite comical, she appears to be good-natured, and has taken on some of the arrogance of some Noxians.

To figure out what she looks like, I've relied on Catra, from the She-Ra reboot, but only on her physical appearance and her name from Katniss from The Hunger Games with a changed letter for the pun with ""Cat"". I have ensured that the abilities do not resemble existing abilities of other champions (such as Rengar, who is also a cat).

&amp;#x200B;

**Short Bigraphy:**

*When Noxus's invasion of Ionia arrived, they were all fleeing those menacing-looking soldiers; all but Catniss. She came from a rather curious but strong tribe if they were offensive to them; the Feli-Catus tribe, a Vastya tribe that focuses on solitary rather than group survival. She saw determination in those soldiers, for weeks considered them strong enemies, even fought against some to see how strong they could be ... none exceeded her expectations until a general cornered her. She replied that he was the only one able to corner her and demanded that he take her to the place where these fighters come from. The general agreed because the invasion failed, so despite the failure that the Noxians would never forget, she did not abandon her cause of learning from these warriors. Over the years, she gained the respect of the strongest Noxians, even wearing armor designed for her; Now she will follow the armies and expand the terrain of her new home ... but she still longs for the times when she helped her tribe.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Abilities (Cooldowns are at level 1):**

\- **Feline Vision \[Passive\]**: When Catniss spots an enemy it will be seen within a radius of 850 units even if it enters a bush. Guardians placed by Catniss (and only by her) also gain this passive, but their range of vision is 177 units less. To get rid of this effect, the enemy champion must abandon 850 units, enter stealth/invisible or die.

\- **Shear Jump \[Q\]**: Catniss can choose a distance to jump, after doing so she will make cuts with her claws, inflicting 70/90/100/120/180 (+45% AD) physical damage, if she jumps a wall with this ability, it will heal 5% of lost HP for each enemy that damages after jumping; this healing is stronger if she has less of 30% of HP.

*Effect with E: Jump range and damage increases, up to 100/130/150/190/210 (+67% AD) physical damage, if jumps a wall with this empowered ability it will not only heal, it will also stun every hited enemy for 1 second.* (9s cooldown, 30 mana)

\- **Battle Emotion \[W\]**: After activating it, Catniss gains 10% of attack speed for 5 seconds and gains Emotion stacks for each minion and monster she kills even if it is not active. Each stack increases damage by 3% of their next ability against champions or big monsters and hitting them removes all stacks. It can be stacked up to a maximum of 15. 

*Effect with E: After activating it, attack speed increases by 20% for 7 seconds even after returning to its original position and for each minion or monster it will give 2 stacks just for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds the ability will return to normal* (20s cooldown, 60 mana)

\- **Attack Position \[E\]**: Catniss will take an attack position, while in this position her movement speed will be reduced by 15%. Performing a basic attack will deal area damage and return to her original position causing it to enter cooldown. Using a abilty that deals damage will also return Catniss to her normal position (35s cooldown, 40 mana)

\- **Claw Outburts \[R\]**: Catniss will concentrate the mana in his claws and launch a cut on the ground causing 100/160/230 (+79/89/100%) physical damage. If it hits 3 enemy targets, the ability can be recast by ripping mana from the enemy causing 15/20/30% of the target's maximum mana as magic damage. Enemy targets that doesn't use mana will always get damage based on their maximun HP, for each level 10/23/35% maximun HP.

*Effect with the E: After launching it, any objective reached can execute the reactivation of the R, without the need for 3 minimum objectives for this. Reactivation aplies 81/99/110% of magic damage (mana or HP for equal) and applying 20% ​​movement speed reduction for 2 seconds. This second cast reduces E cooldown to 80%.* (1m and 30s of Cooldown, 100 of mana)

Just like the title suggests, when you're in the accept or decline screen, add a little Disclaimer that would read:

""Notice: There is an unranked player in this lobby""

Or something to that effect. Players can then accept or decline the match knowing that information. Since there's a 50/50 chance the player could potentially be on your team, or on the other team, smurfing or brand new, players could simply choose to take or not take the coinflip game. 

Obviously this would be disabled early on in the season, but people already dodge these lobbies when they op.gg their teammates in pre game so its not like this would slow down que times, if anything it just saves people time from not having to wait, accept the match, dodge, wait 5 minutes then restart search.",16,1585614014,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs2mpm/when_a_match_is_found_the_accept_or_decline/,leagueoflegends,1

Its been an year and 3 months now since i got perma banned on this account, i still cant get the fact that i got permabanned, and people that are playing the game with way more toxicity are still in it with main accounts. i spent all my night and days in this account, if levels above 30 were back in season 7 i would probably be like level 800 now. i spent more than 200$ of my own earnings ( was 16 back then) and i had so much playing the game even that i was bronze, because what i had there i figured, was fun with my big mistakes, not was not about lost LP. i made so much mistakes in past and im going to psychotherapist right now and i can say that im a whole new person. My brother has aggresion problems in the game still, and im helping him out and trying him to dodge places where i made mistakes so i dont let him suffer like i did. i dont flame people anymore, i realize that everyone have bad games, and that LP and games LOSE AND WIN which was most important thing i didnt know as a 16 dumb kid. after this account got banned i got into more problems, like my family end, (divorce of my parents) which hit me very hard, same as my oldest brother diagnosed with lung cancer, and had very strong stress and depression over school, leading to hard toxicity at the beggining of the season 9, i was actualy asking myself things i never did: how do bad things only happen to me? or am i unluckiest guy on the planet? but the thing i learned from it is that time heals all, i maybe sound like very strange person but i really need to get some things of my chest, to feel better about myself knowing i said it finally. Know my life and other things changed, and i know about myself better, feeling good and knowing i can prove you guys that i CHAGNGED. if you can ust unban me, i will never write any type of harm or insult to anybody or even, i will not even use chat and /muteall everytime, cause i dont want any harm or bad to happen to anyone because i know what is the feeling. i know that i look sketchy, i really do because there are people just trying to troll and scam to get unbanned or refunded and that type of actions but im not going for that. if i type ANY time of harm ANYTIME ANYMORE freely be sure to IP/indefinite ban me. i hope you guys have understanding and that you are not some guy that is on his place in the company for no reason.

fs20xm,Airleek,[Idea] A change to BO3+ tournament matches,"To start off the post, I'm going to say that I just came to this reddit, I've played LoL for a couple of years, I've had a burn-out at some point, and recently started playing and watching tournaments again. I'm rather sure this idea was suggested many times over, and probably considered by Riot, but I'm still going to post it, since it's been bugging me since yesterday.

Ever since the game actually became a competitive block-buster, it has always been the case with LoL tournaments that many champions are almost or simply never picked. Back in the days, it was somewhat understandable, since the game was much simpler, offering much less variety in possible gamestyles and champion roles, AND because there was simply much fewer champions to pick. 

But now there are 150 champions in LoL, the game also changed a lot and this is no longer the case. 150 is a massive number. And how many champions are actually picked in competitive tournaments? I took liberty of checking 2019 Worlds stats, and here are the numbers - over 77 games, 92 champions were picked/banned. Out of these, 15 were only picked once, 10 more were only picked twice, 22 more were picked less than 10 times. This only leaves 53 champions that were picked/banned more than 10 times over 77 games, all of which were played in BO2 or BO3 matches. I could go further and say only 20 champions were picked/banned 20+ times, but you get the point.

Watching the split now, after coming back, I found myself just ignoring the lobby most of the time, because there was simply no variety or surprise to it. Even with such a large champion pool and more bans, there are MAYBE 20 champions that are regularly picked. There can only ever be any surprise if a team decides to focus bans on one position specifically, then it's possible for a relatively less played champion to be picked. There is quite literally less variety than there was back when I was an active player, and that's with the pool being almost twice as large. 

I think it's pretty obvious where I'm going with this post, so it's time to say it straight - I think in BO3+ format, each team should only be able to pick any given champion once per match. This way, over 3 matches, each team would HAVE to play 15 unique champions. Right now, if they so choose and the other team allows them, they can just play the same 5 champions in 3 games. 

Obviously, the teams would still be trading champions, and the first 2 games would still look the same as they currently do, with \~20 top picks going over to either team. But this would add another layer of strategizing, like do you want to pick all of the best picks in the first 2 games, or do you save some for future games? The teams would have to put more attention into what champions were already picked and adapt their future bans and picks adequately. The longer the match would go, the deeper you'd have to look in the champion pool, and eventually you'd have to pick actual rare champions. Imagine a 7 game match, with each team forced to play 35 unique champions, as opposed to having Sett top every game, mixed with potential Sett bans and an off-chance for a Sett support. 

I think the benefit of having a (be it forced, but still) diverse roster used in the tournaments far outweighs the potential drawbacks. I mean, I'd say the most important thing is that the audience enjoys the matches, and frankly, it gets hard to enjoy watching exactly the same game play out exactly the same with different names hovering over healthbars every split games evening. 

Now, as for drawbacks, I think the most important one may be that the more experienced teams, the ones actually influencing/creating the meta, could gain a huge advantage over meta zombie teams, the ones whos potential ends at adapting and following up on the meta. This could possibly cement the competitive scene. But this goes both ways - maybe the weaker teams can actually end up finding more viable picks and strategies and surprise the big names? 

I think there should also be 1 perma-ban per match for each team, in addition to normal bans.

Anyway, this post has turned into something of a wall of text, so I'm going to stop there and leave this post as a food for thoughts. I like LoL, I enjoyed watching the tournaments lately, I just hate to see how stale the champion pool is. Certainly, new champions come into play with each patch's nerfs and buffs, but I just don't think it's enough. What's the point of having 150 champions if 100 of them are never used competitively?

fs1jtb,The_Rad_Shiba,Shyvana Rework Concept,"**Introduction:**

Hi, I'm an Ex-Shyvana main from years back, and I'd like to share my concept for what a ""reworked"" Shyvana would be. This is mostly for my own piece of mind as I hate how Shyvana currently is, and a few friends of mine have told me to ""do it yourself."" So here I am.

So, to give a bit of context, I've been playing this game since late season 2. I don't claim to be perfect at champion design and/or balance, I do however know what makes some champions fun, and what makes those same champions frustrating.

Shyvana has been in a really awkward spot for some time. Her viability as the high clear speed farm jungler that clears camps over and over, and then runs into your lane to whack you with her sack of gold is a bit outdated. Since now, typically junglers need to impact the lanes and the game as a whole as early as possible, Shyvana simply lacks the tools to do so. That is, unless she builds full AP. While strong, its also incredibly simple. Run towards the enemy carry, click your unstoppable ultimate, and then finish them off with your Flame Breath, as both have 1:1 AP ratios (Flame Breath while only in dragon form, while in human form it's 0.7:1). This makes her both incredibly simple to pick up, while also being incredibly frustrating for the enemy team. My rework concept plans to ""fix"" this by making her much less frustrating to play against, and also much more interesting.

**Concept:**

In my opinion, Shyvana has never truly embraced her identity as the Half-Dragon/Dragonborn. The only thing that ever really ""screams"" that she's a dragon is her ultimate, in which case she takes the full form of a dragon. So, I aim to fix that and turn Shyvana into a true changeling, similar to Elise, Nidalee, and Jayce; though with her own unique mechanics of course.

**Passive - Dragonborn:** 

Shyvana gains bonuses to her abilities based on the dragons her team has killed and deals 15% increased Physical and Magical Damage to them.

**Human Form Q - Dragon's Rage:** Cooldown 6 seconds

Shyvana's next basic attack within 6 seconds deals 20/40/60/80/100(+20% Bonus AD) bonus damage and slows her target by 25% for 1.5 seconds and generates 20 fury.

**Dragon Form Q - Searing Bite:** Cooldown 5 Seconds Costs 40 Fury

Shyvana's next basic attack within 8 seconds deals 8/10/12/14% of targets current hp as bonus physical damage.

**Dragon Effect:** For Each Ocean Dragon Shyvana or her team slays, Dragon's Rage and Searing Bite heals Shyvana for 10% of damage dealt.

**Human Form W - Dragon's Flame:** Cooldown 14 Seconds

Shyvana dashes in a direction while surrounding herself in flames for 6 seconds, dealing 20/34/48/62/76(+30% bonus AD) magical damage per second. The duration increases by 1 second for every 30% bonus Attack speed Shyvana has.

**Dragon Form W - Scorched Earth:** Cooldown 6 Seconds - Costs 10 Fury

Shyvana unleashes a heat wave from her body, dealing 50/65/75/80/95(+40% Bonus AD) Magic damage in a small circle around her. Cooldown reduced by 0.5 seconds each time Shyvana auto-attacks and enemy.

**Dragon Effect:** For each infernal dragon shyvana's team slays, Dragon's Flame and Scorched Earth gain 10% increased area of effect.

**Human Form E - Dragon's Roar:** Cooldown 16/14/12/10/8 Seconds

Shyvana lets out a Roar, granting her 20/25/30/35/40% physical damage reduction and 25% Tenacity for 4 seconds and generates 15 fury +10 fury per nearby enemy champion.

**Dragon Form E - Flame Breath:** Cooldown 8 Seconds - Costs 25 Fury

Shyvana shoots out a jet of flame dealing 60/85/110/135/150(+40% Bonus Ad) magic damage to all enemies in it's path, exploding on impact on the first champion hit (champions damage by the hit are not damage by the explosion) and sets the ground ablaze for 5 seconds, marking enemies that step into the area and reducing their armor and magic resist by 30% for 4 seconds.

**Dragon Effect:** For each mountain dragon Shyvana's team slays, Dragon's Roar grants 8% magic damage reduction and Flame Breath Shreds an additional 5% Armor and Magic resist.

**Ultimate - Dragon Form/Human Form:** Cooldown 4 seconds (not affected by cooldown reduction)

Shyvana swaps between human and dragon forms, and gains bonuses based on which form she's in.

In addition, Shyvana's fury cap increases by 20 per rank (starting at 100).

Human Form - Shyvana gains 10/17.5/25/32.5% Increased attack speed, 10/15/20/25 Flat Movement speed, and generate 5/10/15/15 fury per basic attack.

Dragon Form: Shyvana loses 2 fury per second and gains 5/20/35/50 Bonus Attack Damage and 50 bonus Attack Range. Shyvana will instantly exit dragon form when she reaches 0 fury.

**Dragon Effect:** For each Cloud Dragon Shyvana's team slays, Shyvana gains an additional 25 maximum fury.

&amp;#x200B;

**Explanations:**

Whew, that's a whole wall of text. For those of you that read everything, thank you. Now to move on to the ""why"" now that we know the ""what"".

Shyvana's new passive is what I think really makes her much more interesting. It's a slight nerf to the extra damage she gets, but gaining new effects on her abilities per dragon her team kills is very powerful, and should be. With how strong things like the dragon souls are, Shyvana becomes a good pick for winning even harder off of gaining the earliest dragon possible.

  Shyvana's new Qs kind of keep similar to her current, enhancing her autos in some way, but making her not need to build on hit items for it to work effectively. Both give her strong options, but her Dragon Form Q also has the highest fury cost out of any of her abilities, so even though you can probably use it a couple times with cdr, it'll be the only things you do. If I'm being honest though, I really didn't know how else to incorporate a bonus effect for ocean dragon any other way. I wanted to keep the idea of the ""healing"" dragon effect, and this is the only thing I could come up with.

Shyvana's new Ws are very similar to her current, being her general AoE and movement, but in her human form, she swaps out the movement speed for a dash similar to Sejuani's. This is pretty much only so that Shyvana can even try to compete in the league of mobility. Where now she can dash to someone and slow them with her human form Q, if they choose to dash or flash away afterwards, she still has a hard time keeping up. But at least she has options now. The dragon form ability is mostly their to keep her as the high clear speed jungler. Though I don't know exactly what damage numbers she should have, really uncertain whether I make it really low with a larger fury cost, or keep it with the higher damage but with a low fury cost. The dragon effect is mostly their to giver her as stronger presence in teamfights, since giving her more area of effect can make her harder to ignore.

Shyvana's new Es are where I really wanted to change Shyvana. Now that she's no longer hyper-focused on having a lot of on-hit, and theirs no longer those AP ratios, you don't have to worry about AP Shyvana randomly one-shotting your Jinx. Giving her damage reduction is really the only thing I could think of to keep her from falling over in teamfights, and the tenacity helps her against stuns and whatnot when she's trying to gank or peel. I also figured that giving her a away to quickly recharge fury in fights or to gain a quick boost to start her dragon form shenanigans was necessary. Her dragon form E keeps pretty similar to her current, but takes away the ability to one-shot squishies and gives more utility in the armor and MR shred it grants. The dragon effect also is their to give her more impact in teamfights. Since now she gets a bit of magic damage reduction and even more shred with each Mountain dragon kill.

Shyvana's new ultimate is easily the biggest change I made. Probably the most controversial too. I really liked the concepts of each changeling in the game. But it's been years since we've had a new one, and I doubt that we'll get one anytime soon. I didn't want Shyvana to just be another Elise or Nidalee, so I focused more on the physical damage side of things. I also wanted the dragon form to feel powerful, but not one that you could just stay in the whole time like Elise or Nidalee could. Since her abilities have costs to them while in dragon form, it promotes an active playstyle of swapping between the two. The five second cooldown to swapping means that you need to time your transformations correctly. Stay a bit in human form to build up your fury, and then unleash your strong abilities in dragon form for a little bit, then exit it and do it again. I wanted to keep cloud dragon's effect on her ultimate by giving her a longer time to stay in it, and what better way than increasing her fury cap.

&amp;#x200B;

**Closing Statements and Random thoughts:**

I really like what I've come up with. It isn't perfect by any means, their are definitely issues with it that I may not see right now, but to me this is what would really make Shyvana feel like a half-dragon. A Being that embraces that title and makes sure you know it. Since currently, Shyvana kinda just feels like a lizard that hops onto your adc and one shots them every time her ulti is up. 

Overall, I think I did a decent job at making her an interesting champion. Obviously it isn't perfectly balanced. Numbers could use some changes, maybe some effects needed to be removed or added. But I really am tired of how currently, Shyvana only sees play because she has two 1:1 AP ratios that let her one shot someone.",23,1585610055,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs1jtb/shyvana_rework_concept/,leagueoflegends,1
fs1jjk,WoooaahDude,This is not very wholesome but playing with Chinese ADCs as support made me realize how much I despise NA soloq.,"I happened to play senna support with a chinese ezreal adc at a late night queue. As is NA tradition our opponents (sivir+nami) were sitting behind their ranged minion line because they were insecure. I start going in, RIGHT IN THE FCKIN HEAD. Got a fucking soul baby. Nami tries to bubble me and I sidestep because Im fucking clutch baby. And look at the line Ezreal takes. The second nami bubble misses, my ezreal is like YEAH BABY and Es in like the kool aid man to destroy the fishsticks hopes and dreams. Right when the sivir and nami try to burst me, barrier, two quick ones, I already know Im landing my root. Ezreal lands his qs and we get a double kill. Im fucking hype. Everytime I engage a fight he e's in with no hesitation. Everytime he engages a fight I go in no hesitation. And if one of us mechanically fuck up we spam ping each other calling each other trash. And next play go in again without any hesitation because thats what a lane partner fucking does. 

I hate NA ADCs who sit 50 miles behind creeps saying ""hey guys I am going to scale"" fuck that. Same goes for supports who can sit 3 teemos behind the ADC the entire game. This is not how this game is supposed to be played. Playing with NA players is honestly just fucking depressing. No one follows plays, everyone is a kda whore, you would be lucky to see a single team brawl prior to min 20.

If so, then why were we supposed to register our phone numbers to a chinese company to play a ''fair'' match with no smurfs, when not even the matchmaking is correct?What stops higher ranked players to not just farm clash and boost others for fun if it's that easy?I've played other matches vs fresh 30 lvl ''unranked'' accounts which are obviously smurfs.

Since it's pretty early in the season and some ppl are still unranked, let's compare the 2 team's MMR from S9 (keep in mind that this was our first game of the whole tournament):

fs1a89,Magehunter_Skassi,The most balanced mid laners in history: A tier list from an amateur balance expert.,"S Tier: Yasuo, Ekko. 

These two champions have periodically shown up in the meta throughout the years without being too overpowered or too weak, and with having clearly defined strengths and weaknesses that make them thoughtful situational picks. Not bad!

A Tier: Ahri, Zed, Lissandra, Viktor.

The problem is that they go through long periods of sucking. In fact, they actually are really bad champions right now (maybe not Viktor). But they have very fair and quality designs, and sometimes have been a part of the competitive meta without being oppressive aside from S3 Zed and the Crown Viktor meta.

B Tier: Karthus, Veigar, Anivia, Lux, Fizz, Neeko, Brand, Vladimir, Vel'koz, Heimerdinger

Unfortunately these champions are just pretty bad. Neeko's the best of the bunch because she has the best escape tool, but they have outdated designs and are now relevant. But they were great pre-powercreep game designs.

C Tier: Katarina, Twisted Fate, Kassadin, Malzahar, Mordekaiser, Morgana, Cassiopeia, Orianna, Akali

Katarina is completely worthless in competitive and would be worse if people knew how her daggers worked in soloQ, Twisted Fate is gamewarping and lame but got powercreeped out a bit, Kassadin is bad but hard to balance due to the community (as other champions like Vayne/Jax are), Malzahar has always been on the strong side and frustrating to play against, Mordekaiser is almost always bad, Morgana was a 0 interactivity champion who belongs support, Cassiopeia is relatively balanced for a champion that's shown up in competitive so much, Orianna used to be an abomination before even worse terrors were conjured up by Riot, Akali mid was pretty neat but undeniably a little too much before she got slapped a million times.

D Tier: Galio, LeBlanc, Talon, Sylas, Syndra, Aurelion Sol, pre-""rework"" Taliyah, Azir, Corki, Ryze

Pre-rework Taliyah and Aurelion/Talon/Galio are gamewarping 0 interactivity roamers. Sylas/LeBlanc are in the same category of oppressive early games which make them too good when coordinating with your jungler, Syndra's ult damage is overloaded for how good her DPS and utility is (and the fact she ""gains"" damage from missing her Q), Azir/Corki are ADCs who are too safe for how good their smooth scaling into lategame carries is, and the same applies to Ryze. If you have to rework a champion like ten times and they're still overpowered, maybe you're not reworking the right things. 

F Tier: Yi Funnel, Pyke Mid, pre-rework Soraka mid, Urgot mid, Sion mid, Camille mid, Irelia mid, Rumble mid, Renekton mid, Pantheon mid, Gangplank mid

Champions that should have never been permitted to mid lane.

It is same shit every time. Mordekaiser, Aphelios, Garen, Wukong, Diana, it is the same fucking shit. Isn't the balance of the champion an important part of the rework? Wukong is broken, plain and simple. He shouldn't have been released into live serves the way he is. 


I remember nearly 1 year ago, at the first patches of season 9, there were changes for Diana and Wukong. Diana's changes got cancelled, while the Wukong changes got removed from pbe to be developed. So that means that Wukong has been in development for AT LEAST 1 year, and this is the shit we get? Didn't they just stop for 1 second to check him? Maybe play him in custom and see what kind of a monster he is? Didn't they do that for an entire 1 year?? It sounds extremely unlikely that they didn't, and if they did, then why? Why fucking release him like this? Does this make any sense? Why fucking break your game every 2-3 months? Why? I just don't get it.

###CONTEXT

Starting with the 2020 Spring playoffs, there have been some format changes. There is now a double elimination bracket, which you can see below. The 1st-4th seeds are placed in the winners bracket, while the 5th-6th seeds are placed in the losers bracket. Losing a match in the winners bracket (A/B matches) awards you a second chance before you get eliminated. Losing a match in the losers bracket (X/Y/Z matches) immediately eliminates you from the playoffs.

The bracket below summarizes the changes, but to learn more you can [read the rulebook](https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-LCS-Rule-Set-v20.1_6bkbwz26cgp7fngeat6a.pdf), or [see the wiki](https://lol.gamepedia.com/LCS/2020_Season/Spring_Playoffs).

###RESULT

**Cloud9** have chosen to play **100 Thieves** in match A1.

By default, **Evil Geniuses** will play **FlyQuest** in match A2.

fs0tyv,DontFeedTheSmurf,How do you actually counter Lee Sin?,"It feels like his kit has everything you need to face literally any other jungler. He has insane 1v1, insane ganks, good clear, and insane objective control. I play mostly Kayn and Amumu and every time I go up against Lee Sin I don't even know how to win. If I play for drags he just kicks me out of smite range or just Smite/Q to instantly steal it. If I try to gank lanes it only works if he isn't there. And if he's not then he's getting a kill in another lane. If I try to counter jungle him I either lose to him in jungle or he's already cleared everything and currently in my jungle stealing everything.

fs0t61,AtreusIsBack,Sneaky is the current holder of the NA longevity belt but will lose it next year!,"Right now, Sneaky is the player who stayed with the same team without a pause the longest, from season 3 until the end of last year, making it 7 years.

Bjergsen joined TSM before the start of season 4, meaning he will have played for 7 years at the end of this year, but once he plays a single game next Spring split, he will take the belt away from Sneaky.

It's an impressive thing given how many players have come and gone in that time.

I believe Faker is the only other player who has been with the same team without a break longer, since he joined SKT in 2013 and hasn't left yet, meaning he's 1 year ahead of Bjergsen.

Also, if anyone can think of any other player that has been a starter for the same team as long as Sneaky, Bjergsen or Faker, feel free to let me know in the comments.",22,1585607422,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs0t61/sneaky_is_the_current_holder_of_the_na_longevity/,leagueoflegends,1

fs0sj1,sicklerick1337,Why tft is STILL not right,"I don't understand how tft is still so unbalanced...is it merely a gambling game-mode designed to promote skins? I am ranked bronze I in tft. I like to play it whilst having lunch/dinner and the fact that it's solo means you can leave it whenever without consequence. BUT the items system is still completely broken.

 The spatulas were cool initially, before they mostly took them away- but decided not to 100% baffles me. It's something that was best with a higher chance for people to play with attributes and now it's so rare of a drop usually imo it's just a pointless item- I'd rather get an extra gold or two.

 What's extremely awful is how varying the amounts of drops are from player-to-player. IT's something that could be ***fixed*** using a balanced **algorithm  for items/drop/player**. IT's insane that a player can consistently get 3 items/drop (and possibly getting luckier with champs already and gold...) when other players can have issues getting one item or less per drop (ie; 2 gold instead of; items or items plus gold). They could set it up to where you get 1-2 items/drop and maybe some gold (separate algorithm).  

It makes it frustrating and feel I'm wasting my time - I want to be somewhat *mentally engaged*. When you see someone win who has no game-plan ( when it comes to sets of characters, attributes, positioning, saving/spending gold...) because they don't have to; it becomes redundant. Tft is a game mode that should be more relaxed yet should take *some* sort of mental **strategy** more than it does. When the developers leave too much to chance (being L-A-Z-Y) what's the point ? What point is there having a ranked mode when it's not really about skill? :/ 

 Last idea; the amount of space for saving up characters has been weak since the beginning for times when you do get lucky enough to afford a full line-up. Then have to sacrifice characters you technically spent 10 gold on (rerolls) for a tiny fraction of that for space is bs.   Anyone else agree or have other ideas for how to improve tft?",9,1585607359,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs0sj1/why_tft_is_still_not_right/,leagueoflegends,1

fs0lti,krakalot,What the fuck is wrong with EUNE Draft Pick,"I moved from NA to EUNE recently and got back into the game a a week ago. Made a new account for EUNE. Started playing and apart from the usual children swearing in the 30 blind pick games I played its been fine. 

Then I spent the last 20 games over three days on EUNE at different times. My god. There are CONSTANT DCs, rage quitters, Slavic swears of all nations and English of the most caveman level. It is absolutely the most cancerous 15 games I've played and I've played the game since season 1. I've never met a more deranged user base of people with potato machines, terrible English swears, constant rage quitting and all sort of other utterly moronic behaviour. 

Maybe 15 games is too little of a sample so I will continue my misadventures before I get to rank 30 into this den of idiocy. 
And just to point out though my original account is NA (since Australia used to be on NA servers in Season 1, and I afterwards lived in Canada, I do come from eastern Europe originally and have lived here on and off and speak the languages so I am saying this out of cultural estrangement, this game mode is literally cursed.) 

People take draft pick more seriously than blind pick, is this a taste of what is to come in ranked more for EUNE because I may just abandon this venture and deal with higher ping?",15,1585606733,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs0lti/what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_eune_draft_pick/,leagueoflegends,1

This guy is my favorite champion and has been since season 1, when he was reworked I was a little upset but I've grown to like the new Swain. I do prefer that his Q and R was like how it was before, but his new W, E, and passive is just so FUN.

If it isn't much to ask, it would be cool for Swain to whip out his cane and whack minions or players if they are in auto-attack range; I think it would add more flavor to the champion.

Then I spent the last 20 games over three days on EUNE at different times. My god. There are CONSTANT DCs, rage quitters, Slavic swears of all nations and English of the most caveman level. It is absolutely the most cancerous 15 games I've played and I've played the game since season 1. I've never met a more deranged user base of people with potato machines, terrible English swears, constant rage quitting and all sort of other utterly moronic behaviour. 

Maybe 15 games is too little of a sample so I will continue my misadventures before I get to rank 30 into this den of idiocy. 

And just to point out though my original account is NA (since Australia used to be on NA servers in Season 1, and I afterwards lived in Canada, I do come from eastern Europe originally and have lived here on and off and speak the languages so I am saying this out of cultural estrangement, this game mode is literally cursed.) 

People take draft pick more seriously than blind pick, is this a taste of what is to come in ranked more for EUNE because I may just abandon this venture and deal with higher ping?",5,1585604845,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fs00n1/what_the_fuck_is_wrong_with_eune_draft_pick/,leagueoflegends,1

frzwqn,LongSwordsForLIife,Dealing with all the reworks and new champions in toplane is getting tiresome,"Seems to be going on for a while now, where a new champion or reworked one gets buffed/nerfed or redone to the point where they are no longer a ""standard kit"" but rather more annoying to harder to fight but easy to perform well on.


Most of these champions are awful design and does not survive in the midlane vs long range poke or waveclear.

They cant jungle because only a few select picks can be good in the jungle. All thats left is going toplane.

Things get removed or nerfed eventually but the time it takes for dev team to make a decision is bonkers and is destroying this game for me.

Things that I have had to deal with over the course of the last 2 years include:


Playing Melee vs Ranged while being farmed by **Kleptomany** (Removed)

**Mordekaiser** winning EVERY FIGHT unless you are some hardcore monster carry late game like Master YI or Vayne. He beats every lane bully in lane, including Renekton, Darius, Tryndamere and Jayce. The amount of times I have dodged Morde Q and E, and then lost the trade to his stupid Passive is insane. His passive is a mini fiddlesticks ult and he just keeps you there with AoE slows from Rylais.

His base damage is so good, that you can go Tabis into Bramble Vest and just faceroll people without taking damage. 

**Sett** is in a place where he has more stats than you at all times. His pull is insanely short and the stun on top is super op to play against. He gets free wavecontrol every game because of its range. Irelia E got nerfed because of this but they cant stay consistent. 

**Garen** is just spinning and healing.


**Wukong** is the best champion in 2 roles, while being strong and easy to play. Just like every new champ that gets released these days. There is nothing cool about him. Nothing high impact like a Jarvan or Galio R. 

Hes just annoying and has too many base stats.



This is the level at which the dev team thinks about toplane and what is needed there.

We ask for more early game agency and our teleport is nerfed with cooldown. Yes, my Renekton TP at 30 minutes on a lower cooldown is insane. Thank you!


They are giving Nasus a wither range buff. Wither is already annoying as hell to play against. You cant escape it even with tenacity. Why?

Why the increase in annoyance? Whats so hard about buffing his useless E or cutting some mana costs or something. Thats something Nasus really struggle with. But no.

Fiddlesticks is one of the oldest champion in the game. He was there since release in 2009. Personally, when the new Fiddle was revealed in the trailer, i was scared and hyped at the same time. It also made me sad. Sad to think this goofy scarecrow is going to leave us.

After watching this [Fiddlesticks.Exe Rework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxcLUBhkzqE), i read the comments and many people are going to miss the goofy old fiddlesticks too.

Should riot make something to remember the old Fiddlesticks? Like an emote, icon, a ward or something else?

frzmvh,TGreen1993,What to do vs heimer as melee?,"This question has probably been asked multiple times, but i have to share my frustrations with what i see as a broken champion.  


Let me share my frustrations, and hopefully my view on this champion can change.   


1. I feel like if you pick a melee into this champion, you are automatically losing the laning phase. you lose the ability to kill creeps, unless you have some form of ranged ability, even then, you lose a lot of farm. This is done with no effort, because of heimer's turrets, and how they auto focus champions.  

2. You could gank him, but that is very hard, especially if you got a squishy jungler, and the heimers knows abit to play around turrets.  

3. You dont really get a reward for killing turrets. They cost almost no mana, and recharge every 20 seconds. but killing them as a melee, will lose you alot of health, meaning that the time you get the health back to trade, he's got his turrets up again.
4. And lastly, he can bully you. Heimerdinger is supposed to be a defensive champion, that you cannot engage on, because of his defensive turrets. But that's not the case, because if you go in for cs, the turrets will automatically focus you, and lose you alot of health. You are forced to cs under turret, but because heimerdinger is a ranged champion, you will get poked down for every cs you get.  


My frustration is that he counters too many champions, with little to no effort, and that does not seem balanced. Maybe if they made heimerdinger a melee champion, he'd have the same defensive ability around his turrets, but he wouldn't be able to poke as hard, or get plates as easily, if he was melee.  


Let me remind you that this is my point of view, and my frustrations, and it's okay to disagree. In fact, i'd love to hear WHY you disagree.  


have a very good evening.

frzaky,Frelayer,"What if, making skins for champions boosts their popularity, and making 0 skins for a champ for 5+ years actually lessens their popularity??","Everyone is in this ""cause and effect"" idea with skin conversations. Popularity = More skins, but I wonder about the inverse of the equation. Maybe having 549 Lux/Miss Fortune skins make them more popular. As players are A. More likely to find a skin they like. B Have a fresh coat of paint every year and C. Way more eligible for chromas and D. You are more likely to see the new skin, and be inspired to play them yourself because of others playing it. Imagine running an experiment where you drop a new skin for someone like Ornn/Zac/Skarner/Kindred (I'm partial to Skar Guardian) every 8 months or so for a single one of those champs. Do we think their popularity wouldn't rise? Especially if they were good quality skins? I bet you would see a spike in their play rates, old mains coming back. People inspired to try them out in norms etc. I don't think they would be most played or anything, but I think if lux hadn't gotten a skin in the last 5 years, her popularity wouldn't be as high. I'm not saying it's a drastic influence, but I definitely think it's something.

frz0px,CharismaticO5,History of SKT (Chapter II),"Hi! Here’s the second part of SKT’s story but first let’s remember where we left off. SKT, already a very successful organization in esports, decided to create two teams of League of Legends. The first was acquired from Eat Sleep Game, with Reapered leading the way as the shotcaller and star. The second, a group of rookies with experienced players  that generated high expectations. After a long qualifying tournament, both teams qualified for Spring Split 2013.

# Spring 2013

At that time the server in Korea had been around for about 1 year, so a new generation of talents had appeared to stay. It was the second generation of players, the first coming from NA servers when the game was first formed. Bengi, Faker and Piglet were some of the most interesting players of this second generation and kkOma convinced them to join SKT 2 alongside Impact (first generation) and PoohManDu. This second team, despite being new, had high expectations of qualifying for playoffs, even though the draw left them in the death group with CJ Blaze, Najin Sword, KT Arrows, MVP Ozone and MVP Blue.

As for SKT 1, the team had a perfect start winning the IEM Cologne the previous year, but the results in China's StarsWar League and the qualys for IEM Katowice left a bad taste. The team relied heavily on Reapered, with an inconsistent bot and a mid with a small champ pool.  Despite this, SKT 1 was expected to qualify for playoffs with no problems by having a more accessible group.

This is how the history of SKT began at the highest level. SKT 2 debuted nothing more and nothing less than against CJ Blaze, a team where one of the best mid laners in the world played in Ambition. Game 1, minute 6:20, Faker has his counterpart under tower and is harassing him with aa, hits the Q, jumps in and first kill of his career, what a statement it was. SKT won the [series 2-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNscLv6l6tU) and continued to win the group with a 3-1-1. The only team to stop them was MVP Ozone, a team that will surely ring the names of Homme, DanDy, dade, imp and Mata. Meanwhile, SKT 1 did his thing and tied ALL the series they played, finishing third in their group with a 0-5-0. Come on, it was what was expected from them.

Playoffs came and SKT 1 fell 0-3 against CJ Blaze, a far superior team in every respect with a stellar top laner in Flame. On the other hand, SKT 2 defeated NaJin Shield 3-0 and would face, guess who, MVP Ozone in the SF. Summing up the split, SKT2 had immense talent, so superlative that many times just that alone was enough to win games. Faker, Piglet and PoohManDu dominated their lanes at pleasure with Impact adjusting to what the team needed. And bengi? the right hand. He was not a dominant jungler like DanDy or KaKAO, but the aggressiveness of his teammates allowed him to invade, ward, gank and any other movements that were gold for the team. However, MVP Ozone was different. DanDy didn't care so much about Faker, but about the side lanes, and he exerted such pressure that soon bengi was behind, then his teammates and in the end, the whole SKT team. MVP Ozone [won 3-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPhEgGOPTeE) and then became champions against CJ Blaze while SKT2 won third place against CJ Frost.

# Summer

SKT1, after falling in quarters against CJ Blaze, qualified for the NLB Spring, a tournament played by the eliminated teams from the OGN. There, they ended fourth behind both sets of NaJin and KT Bullets. These results, added to the success of SKT2, resulted in SK Telecom undoing the team for Summer. Reapered, Raven, and StarLast went to Jin Air Falcons, SuNo went as a sub to MVP Blue and Beelzehan stayed on SKT as a sub to bengi.

For SKT2, expectations were even higher after the impressive Spring debut, and the team more than met. They improved their macro with good rotations and better teamfighting that, along with their superiority in micro, put them first in the group ahead of NaJin Shield, MVP Blue and Incredible Miracle 2. In playoffs, an easy 3-0 to their ex-teammates from Jin Air Falcons, a precious revenge against MVP Ozone in the semifinals, and then [The Final](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvXLe9xT1UE).

SKT was facing KT Rolster Bullets. KaKAO was the star, one of the best jungles in the world with that aggressive style that fans liked. In fact, KaKAO was so outstanding that upon returning to KTB, he sent inSec to the top lane to the detriment of Ssumday. Ryu was one of the best mid laners in the world and Score and Mafa completed a bot lane that always showed good level and Score, the adc, had an exemplary positioning despite not being as flashy as Piglet or imp. The final was unforgettable, one of the best Bo5 ever with two teams and top players. The way to solve it, of course, was a Game 5 with Blind picks that would end up leaving us the [incredible 1v1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8vGaC4OZIs) from Faker to Ryu with Zed. Less than 1 year after creating the team SKT2 were champions of Korea, but it wasn't everything.

# Worlds 2013

As OGN Summer champions, SKT qualified for the final round of the gauntlet where they faced, again, KT Bullets. They repeated the victory, now by an easier 3-1. In this way, SKT qualified to Worlds as one of the favorites to win the trophy. In the group stage they made good account of the above and were first with an impressive 7-1. They defeated Lemondogs, TSM and GamingGear. eu without problems, but OMG was a more complicated rival. The Chinese, led by Gogoing, LoveLing and Cool, managed to score 1-1 against SKT, as well as finishing second with the same record of 7-1. Anyway, the [famous SKT push](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SM9fqtc2lyo&amp;t=30s) that ended in an inhibitor at 12 minutes vs OMG was a clear example of the team's potential.

SKT easily took care of Gamania Bears in QF (2-0) and faced NaJin Black Sword in SF. NJBS was a team full of talent, with one of the best top laners in Expession, a jungler that represented the aggressive style of the time in watch, a new star figure in Nagne and a high level bot lane with PraY and Cain.  However, NJBS had been leaving poor results and was only in Worlds for what they had done the previous season. Also, they had not gone through the group stage either, so the semifinal didn't promise to be much disputed. But the truth is that this SF would become one of the best Bo5s in history. NJBS and SKT gave us a memorable series and SKT took the [3-2 victory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebhrVu7CKkQ)

In the final, Royal Club awaited, a team that came from defeating OMG in QF and the legendary Fnatic lineup in SF. RYL had already experienced players, but the star was a very young Uzi who was already a sensation worldwide.  The closed semifinal against NJBS and the great level shown by RYL led to a final that promised a lot, but it was not like that. SKT swept with a [resounding 3-0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsO88QkLNmY) and took home the title. The Korean Hype Train was real and SKT was the best team in the world by far.

fryfh6,fuckmeinthesoul,Rework Kindred,"She's an ass. Nonexistent in pro play, barely seen in SoloQ, doesn't sell any skins. Also, her kit doesnt work with her theme nor her supposed role at all.

Thematically she's supposed to be a hunter that chooses its pray and hunts it down. Gameplay-wise she's supposed to invade enemy jungle to gain marks and gank alot to be useful (both are high risk activities primarily done in the early game)

But for some reason she is a scaling adc-ish champion? She cant invade jungle against most opponents to gain a mark, because she is a weak early duelist and everyone on the map can see the mark, ward it and then camp her; marks also take forever to appear on the champion, so its almost impossible to mark your target at the start of the gank and receive that mark by the end of it. You're supposed to do it early, and if you are playing against competent players, they will play carefully to avoid giving it to you. Yeah, she has an ult which is great, i love it and this ability is unique, but its a fit for support, not for the scaling champion nor a duelist.

My suggestion is: 1. remove mark-stacking in its current form. If it stays or becomes harder to gain- it will be a waste of an ability, if it becomes easier to gain - we'll receive a Senna situation. It should be gone, or have a limit or something. 2. Change her ultimate completley (so it would include wolf preferably, currently it doesnt feel like a part of the champion). 3.

frycdl,Ferromagneticfluid,"Damage done, tankiness and other stats should be more about the items (gold) you have, than what your champion is","Some champions are tanky because they are tanky champions. Champions that do damage do damage because they are damage champions.

If a Zed or Yasuo is 1/5, I shouldn't be worrying about their damage that much. Comparatively, if a Garen builds no tank items he shouldn't be very tanky. I am all for build diversity but a Garen who builds pure damage should die very quickly.

This has become a huge issue in the game, tons of hidden stats in which instead of looking at a champion's total gold and items, you need to know every single champion's damage output and tankiness. That is fine to a degree, but they have gone way too far.

It is fine that some champions scale better than others, but what is not fine the no item Zed that lost lane hard can easily kill me or the 0 tank items Garen is so tanky my 3-4 item adc or mid mage can't do any damage to him.",10,1585599368,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frycdl/damage_done_tankiness_and_other_stats_should_be/,leagueoflegends,1

fryaje,fuckmeinthesoul,Pls Rework Kindred,"She's an ass. Nonexistent in pro play, barely seen in SoloQ, nonexistent above diamond, doesn't sell ant skins. Also, her kit doesnt work with her theme nor her supposed role at all.  


Thematically she's supposed to be a hunter that chooses its pray and hunts it down. Gameplay-wise she's supposed to invade enemy jungle to gain marks and gank alot to be useful (both are high risk activities primarily done in the early game)  


But for some reason she is a scaling adc-ish champion? She cant invade jungle against most opponents to gain a mark, because she is a weak early duelist and everyone on the map can see the mark, ward it and then camp her; marks also take forever to appear on the champion, so its almost impossible to mark your target at the start of the gank and receive that mark by the end of it. You're supposed to do it early, and if you are playing against people with an ounce of brain, they will play carefully to avoid giving it to you. Yeah, she has an ult which is great, i love it and this ability is unique, but its a fit for support, not for the scaling champion nor a duelist.  


My suggestion is: 1. remove mark-stacking in its current form. If it stays or becomes harder to gain- it will be a waste of an ability, if it becomes easier to gain - we'll receive a Senna situation. It should be gone, or have a limit or something. 2. Change her ultimate completley (so it would include wolf preferably, currently it doesnt feel like a part of the champion). 3. Give her way to duel opponents, either by giving her more damage, more slow for enemy and/or haste for herself, making her more of an assasin; or give her more sustain and make her more bruiser-like.

fry9p4,Zagan_baal,Why am i forced to pick an additional role and sometimes get a 3rd one i never even proposed??,"Matchmaking is specially a pain in the ass to mid lane players because of the lane popularity. I am a mid lane player, i mostly pick mid lane as 1st role and adc/jungle as second role depending on the current 2nd most popular after mid lane. The problem is i don't excel at neither adc or jungle. i'm okay and average. But i excel (compared to my elo) at mid lane and support. Then why don't i take mid lane as 1st and support as 2nd, so obvious right?? well the thing is.. you're almost guaranteed to get support if you pick it with mid lane because support is a lot more available than mid lane.

the feeling probably already popped in your mind. ''THIS SUCKS''

Hey, don't get me wrong tho. i don't mind auto fill but i hate the way it's implemented. In my opinion, should be different. When you're auto fill protected, you should be given the choice to select as many roles you want and choose how many. For example: 1st pick mid lane, 2nd pick top lane ( said no one ever), 3rd pick jungle. Or just pick mid lane if you're up to a 6+ minute lobby time (which i am). 

When auto fill is activated, it should be the same system. Except now, you're obligated to choose 2 roles and still be vulnerable to be put at a different role than those 2. One might say this defeats the point but we don't have a choice because of various reasons (player numbers, servers, lane popularity etc..) or you can make your own league server with the old mmr based classification and have summoner 4 say the old golden phrase 'mid or feed'

P.S: i'm not proposing eliminating the current system, i'm recommending adding an alternative and advanced option.",7,1585599140,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fry9p4/why_am_i_forced_to_pick_an_additional_role_and/,leagueoflegends,1

fry6nx,WildButLoyalNugget,Eika tilted me so hard I don't even want to watch the rest of LCS today,"I love IMT. They were the first team I liked since the OG Moscow 5/Gambit Gaming squad. I was so sad when Immortals weren't around- and beyond excited when they came back! I finally had a favorite team to support again! 

I could have cried from happiness when they got Xmithie, who has been one of my favorite players for a long time now. I rooted for IMT so hard this season... but Eika made that so difficult. The fact that he's an import, the fact that he got a place over Pobelter, the fact that he is just **so bad.** 

This last game with him on Zoe actually just tilted me so hard I have absolutely 0 interest in watching the rest of LCS today or supporting IMT ever again. Not because IMT lost, but because of the terrible coaching decisions and because I just cannot support someone like Eika who is so trash and (based on interviews) doesn't care to improve. It makes me sad for Xmithie, who imo deserved to have a better team around him.

Just annoyed. I loved IMT, I really enjoy watching LCS, but I'm too bitter about Eika and annoyed with his trash Zoe to even happily enjoy the next few games.",0,1585598883,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fry6nx/eika_tilted_me_so_hard_i_dont_even_want_to_watch/,leagueoflegends,1

I have waited to get this name for literally 9 months. I looked at the time run lower, almost every week, atleast once. I wanted this Account name so bad. 

So, sure enough yesterday, on the big day, i waited till 2 in the morning. I sat here watching the timer go down. I couldn't wait, ""Nico"" would be mine. The last 10 seconds, everything was ready to go, 13900 BE on my account, shop open and my fingers were warmed up to press the ""check username"" button. 

The timer hit 0 and i checked the name, this was it, i have waited so long and what do i see? Exactly, someone else was faster, i thought. Some ""human"". 

I add the account to see who this guy is who got it, maybe a Diamond/Platinum player i can play with. 

Nope, its a botted account and the guy used a bot to take the name instantly. No chance for humans. I was bummed, so i asked him if he would sell me the account. 

I didnt even want to play on it, just swap account names, which is totally possible, riot even has a ""how to switch account names"" on their website. 

The botter asks for 30€, and i think, sure, im 22 and i really want the name. f it. So i paypal him 30 bucks, he gives me the account. I change the email and pw, i think great. This is it, maybe i'll get my dream name afterall. 

FALSE, my Riot support guy, didnt want to/""couldn't"" switch the accounts, because i clearly didn't create the Account, which the botter used to take the name. 

And sure enough 10 min later the account with the name ""Nico"" was banned. 

Now i lost 30 Bucks, the account and my pride. 

oh btw, the botter instantly got the account back with another Bottet account. He will probably scam some other poor guy named Nico. 

the moral of the story, dont buy accounts. its stupid. and dont ever try to be happy, because chances are, some guy will use your happiness to make some money.",0,1585594535,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frwr6j/account_name_botters_why_allowed/,leagueoflegends,1

I’ve been one tricking Shaco this season and despite some matches where I go 14/1 AND have dragon soul somehow im still on a 13 game losing streak. Every opponent I’ve had that is also an assassin jungler (Evelynn, Rengar, Kha Zix) seemed pretty useless for their team as well. From what I understand, jungle camps respawn too fast, offer too much gold and scaling champs are the best for the meta, so having an assassin jungler, who’s job is to create an early lead through ganks and invades, is kind of a useless role right now. It just really pains me that I can kill someone at lvl 1, take their red side for the whole game, take every dragon, and still lose because they just outscaled me. Is it just bad luck? Is there something about being an assassin jungler that im missing?

This means that lux can potentially get in free hits not because you didn't try to dodged or anything but because you guessed wrong.  

I would personally like her e to be more like a karthus q in that it show's where it will land so you can be equipped with the knowledge necessary to actually dodge and not just guess when you have to either keep moving forward, backwards or diagonally to get out of her e skillshot.

frw2hu,MooseMaster3000,The problem with the lower token amounts is the time,"Not the price. 

If they increased the cost but left token gains the same, it wouldn't make all that much of a difference. You have to buy at least $15 (2030) RP to buy the 1650 RP pass anyway, unless you're just sitting on 270+ RP. Which leaves you with only 380-- enough to buy a grand total of 1 orb. Which would be totally fine as a trade-off. 

But instead, what they've done is require 20-30% more **time** for the same amount of tokens with *no option to earn as many tokens as before.* If the goal was to increase the length of the break people take after getting burnt out on grinding tokens, mission accomplished. 

Hell, if nothing else, they should sell the pass at its current price and token amounts, along with some sort of token booster that brings the amounts back up to 12/8. Or even higher than that, and charge more for it than 380 RP. Just something so that the grind doesn't make you want to stop playing for year (or the rest of the quarantine, whichever comes first).",6,1585592366,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frw2hu/the_problem_with_the_lower_token_amounts_is_the/,leagueoflegends,1

I'm a jungle main and have mained every role besides ADC at one time or another during my 9-year career. I find that I have the most success playing league when I play mechanically simple champions. I believe it's because 1) it's harder to mess up, and 2) I can focus more on macro when I'm less focused on my champion's micro.

I'm at the point where my macro is getting good enough that I'm ready to branch out to some more complex junglers with high skill caps and more micro outplay potential than my normal champion pool.

While doing my research on what software's most coaches use (for vod reviews that you send out, not screen-share/stream) and it led me to downloading Epic Pen. I tinkered around with it before I tried to load into a VOD, and it worked fine, but I couldn't get it to appear in the VOD as an overlay. Is this something that I need to fix through the settings of either program or something? Not familiar with these types of programs, so any help is very very much appreciated. Also, does anyone know if you can use Epic Pen during live games that you are spectating? Again, thank you in advance for whatever help you can provide!

Plus he would be forced to buy some mana items at the begining of the game soo no more rush Spirit Visage+mercurial boots against ap match-ups,plus his first power spike wouldn't be a 2.5 k gold item it would need to be a bit more expensive.

frv668,relliket,It takes far too long to unlock champions (maths),"I appreciate this game is F2P, but unfortunately that also makes it pay-to-win, want to have the perfect counter pick to a meta champion right now? You basically have to buy them with RP. It just takes far too long to unlock all the champions without spending money.

If you didn't know, the xp to gain a level is like a wave, it increases from levels 1-50, then at level 50 it decreases again (2592) to 74 (3684) then back down to 2592 until lvl 99 and back down etc etc...

Using my current level of 32 (so at the low end of the spectrum), I gained 218 experience in a 32 minute win. thats 6.8 xp per minute. It would take 395 minutes (2688/6.8) of PURE WINNING, no queues or lobbies or anything like that to level up. What do I get for levelling up? A champions capsule, this, on average, contains on average 3600 BE (assuming you disenchant all the shards) data from  [https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8791m0/opening\_100\_champion\_capsules\_and\_sharing\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8791m0/opening_100_champion_capsules_and_sharing_you/) this averages out to 9.11 BE per minute. (assuming you always need 2688 xp, which isn't true and is below the average)

The total cost of all 148 champions is 582150 BE, therefore to unlock every champion it would take 63875 minutes, or 1065 hours, or 44.35 days of played time assuming you won literally every game, not including lobbies or queues. Or put simply, to unlock a 6300 BE champion it takes over 11 and a half hours of PURE WINNING.  


Yes I appreciate there is the daily win boost, or you can use your champion shards, but if you want a specific 6300 BE champion you basically have to buy them with RP or buy ingame XP boosts.",30,1585589541,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frv668/it_takes_far_too_long_to_unlock_champions_maths/,leagueoflegends,1

frv2u9,ToastedBeef,Udyr only has 3 abilities yet lee sin has 6 plus an ult,"Hello I’m trying to spread some love to my favorite champion Udyr. The more I play him the more time passes and I realize he will never get the attention he deserves. 

As for the title, yes udyr is the only champion with 3 abilities if played correctly. Once you max all 3 stances he cannot access the other. On top of his long list of issues this makes him more useless, less skillful, and more predictable.

Lee Sin and elise nidalee get away with 6! Its absolutely unfair!

The fix? I think its simple. Give him an ultimate. As much as I love phoenix its time to remove it. Riot has no intention of making it viable compared to tiger so might as well book it. The solution I would like instead (as an udyr main) is to pick the 3 stance you want and THEN the other becomes an ultimate. That could be his new passive and would be really enjoyable to play different games like this but realistically I don’t know if they would do this.

Imagine this: you play your lane, and suddenly your enemy laner wants to trade. No problem, slap him with your stick to show dominance. He wants to continue? Ok then bamboozle him and make your clone attack him too. You press R, and the enemy wants to run away because he overestimated his power against the mighty man himself.

But wait? There comes the enemy jungler? No worries, charge at him with your E, cast your R for the 2nd time, get these sweet double buffs and make him regret his decision to get into your field of vision, because that's how far you can travel with e and q.

But wait? Suddenly enemy botlane rotates top too, and now Wukong has absolutely nothing to beat these guys up. I mean come on. Give him a break. How is he supposed to close the game pre 20 minutes without being able to properly 1v4 ? Show Wukong some love, and give his R a third cast.

While we are at that, what would you guys think about this: anytime he leaves a bush, he can Rengar-like leap and cleave for AoE damage. This would help him to push waves faster, and the enemy laner won't leave his tower anyway unless he wants to int to accelerate the process of the lost game.

frukh9,iaace,LoL Rewind Website (Year In Review Generator),"# https://rewind.lol/

This website will generate a full match-history-in-review, compiling data from every match played within the last 2 years.

See https://imgur.com/a/tlOiiXQ or https://rewind.lol/user.html?username=Shmikal&amp;region=NA for an example of what to expect.

This idea came from a friend who had an upcoming birthday in December of last year. I wanted to give him a cool gift so I made him a personal stats website at https://shmik.al/ . At the time, generating and publishing the data required 50% manual work, so it was a pretty labor intensive process for me. I originally wanted to give back to the LoL community by giving away a few of these to random League community members but the rules on various forums were too complicated, so I continued to make websites manually for my friends' birthdays until today. I wanted to experiment with making this available for the larger league community at no cost. If you can help keep the website running, that would be appreciated a lot.

Discord server: https://discord.gg/MTqDXvB

## Features
- Fun facts like W/L streaks, likelyhood of tilting
- Cool network graphs for your friend relations and item builds
- Stats per champion played by you, your team, and your enemies
- Friend stats
- Stats by match length
- Heatmaps of places you got kills/deaths
- Calendar heatmaps of when you play league
- Hourly winrate heatmaps
- Tables of items built by you, your team, and the enemy
- Lots of stat-appropriate colors

## Ideal Summoners
Feel free to try this website even if you don't meet the ideal criteria; but just know that certain sections of the website may be empty or non-functional.
You've played at least 50 games that meet all of the following criteria:

- PvP (not vs AI)
- matchmade (not custom games)
- 5v5
- summoner's rift
- non-RGM
- in the last 2 calendar years

## How to use it
1. Enter your name
2. Press the Update/Add button
3. Wait in line/(wait in the queue)
4. Return to the homepage and use the lookup button once you've been processed
5. Definitely share it with your friends and post your page here!

## Limitations
- It is slow to process each player one by one (there is a lot of data to retrieve)
- It might be hugged to death by initial traffic
- It might have bugs
- It might look bad
- It will have data from the past 2 calendar years, so that would include data from seasons 8, 9, and 10.
- I am the only one working on it and I am providing it on a best-effort basis

I sincerely hope you enjoy it and discover something interesting :P",107,1585587661,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frukh9/lol_rewind_website_year_in_review_generator/,leagueoflegends,1
fruk4x,10LoL,Kindred needs a rework,"Kindred seriously needs a change.

Her passive is really hard to use because it’s so risky to invade enemies ins a SoloQ environment where priority and team play don’t really exist. Her passive is nearly useless.

So why does Senna get a far better version of Kindred’s passive? Why does senna get to have more range, damage, crit chance, and lifesteal just for being *around* when minions/objectives die? Meanwhile, Kindred has to risk so much to not even get anything until she gets 4 stacks on her passive, and even when she DOES hit 4 stacks, the power level is so much lower. 

Kindred really needs a change to her passive. The hunting mechanic is fine in theory, but either the way to get stacks needs to be easier and/or the rewards need to be greater as right now her passive is garbage.",94,1585587629,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fruk4x/kindred_needs_a_rework/,leagueoflegends,1

fruiwd,ToastedBeef,Udyr is the ONLY champion with only 3 abilities and is the most neglected champion I’m league of legends,"Hello I’m trying to spread some love to my favorite champion Udyr. The more I play him the more time passes and I realize he will never get the attention he deserves. 

As for the title, yes udyr is the only champion with 3 abilities if played correctly. Once you max all 3 stances he cannot access the other. On top of his long list of issues this makes him more useless, less skillful, and more predictable.

The fix? I think its simple. Give him an ultimate. As much as I love phoenix its time to remove it. Riot has no intention of making it viable compared to tiger so might as well book it. The solution I would like instead (as an udyr main) is to pick the 3 stance you want and THEN the other becomes an ultimate. That could be his new passive and would be really enjoyable to play different games like this but realistically I don’t know if they would do this.

I have a million points and a million ideas so please hit me with those comments riot!",1,1585587515,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fruiwd/udyr_is_the_only_champion_with_only_3_abilities/,leagueoflegends,1

frtw7u,messythehoe,"In low elo, don't ban your counters ban the broken solo Q champions."," As an Evelynn main every meta jungler, and then some, counters me in some way. With that being said, I always ban a non counter - Master Yi. Not because he's difficult for me to deal with but because unless my team is highly coordinated (which is sometimes in rare in solo Q) he can run everyone down. The same applies for certain other 'busted' 1v5 champions (think Sett, Nasus, Tryndamer, Warwick, Illao, etc) who can walk around doing whatever they want knowing they won't be punished because of how busted their sustain is and how bad the enemy's coordination would be at low elo. A lot of these champions play like an MMO boss fight than your team can never win. It is better to play safe and give up farm/camps to a counter pick while you scale/outplay than to have some brute running your team down with no repercussions. A lot of times it will cause frustration in your team. 

This is where a big problem in smurfing stems from. Higher elo players abusing certain ""busted"" champions at lower elos because they know low elo doesn't know how to collectively deal with them hence why people funnel.

I'm not saying a cooldown of 14 seconds like Kled's but around 4 - 2.5 seconds would be great, really.

frsqjd,Flint124,A revamp of Eleisa's Miracle.,"For the uninitiated, this item was removed at the start of season 4 because it was terrible and nobody bought it for 3 the three years it existed.

For 1100 gold, it granted:

* 10 HP5
* 15 MP5

That's 115% gold efficient on stats that are fairly desirable for supports.

It's not slot efficient, sure, but that takes care of by one of its passives.

* Eleisa's Blessing: After levelling up three times, 

Ok, so that is genuinely not bad, especially with how you needed so many slots open for wards at the time. Why didn't people build it?

Well, there were several reasons.

First off, lots of the item's value is based in its other passive.

* Aid: Reduce the CD's of Clarity, Heal, and Clairvoyance by 25%.

You can already tell that this is bad. Clarity and CV were so bad that they were removed from SR entirely. Heal isn't bad *anymore*, and it's currently the spell of choice for all ADC's and even some mids and supports, but back *then* it was complete and utter garbage.

The second big reason was that it built out of Philo Stone.

With Philo, you wanted to keep it for as long as possible for its gold passive, which was lost on upgrade.

Eleisia's requires 3 levelups to trigger its passive. If you bought it early, you could trigger it quickly, but if you waited to get value from Philo, you'd be a higher level and end up with Eleisia's in your inventory for *way* longer.

You were honestly better off holding onto Philo and rushing Emblem of Valor into Aegis, or if you wanted to upgrade you'd just go Shurelya's.

That said, with the way things are right now, I think we can make this item work again... with tweaks.

frsiak,Ghettoblaster1945,Could mobility creep get nerfed in the form of adding countermechanics ?,"We saw that recently (last 2-3 seasons) champions often got small things in their kit to counter a specific stat etc.

For example: 
Renekten W breaking shields
Kled Q Reducing healing
Katarina R reducing healing

And we always hear that there is too much mobility in the game. So why dont they give more champions a ground or something ? 

For example:
Amumu has his q as only gapcloser. Champions are able to dash out of his w, so why dont they reduce the sive of his w and give him a ground instead ?

Janna is one of the best enchanters. Why dont change her w ? Imagine janna w wouldnt be a slow, but a short ground with a higher cd compared to her current w.

frshd6,HellenicLady,Why do low elo junglers never help the ranged top laners in their team?,"I think most low elo junglers think that just because the ranged top laner ""wins"" lane, it means that they can totally ignore top and focus in other lanes.

I play mainly ranged top laners in low platinum and I have noticed that while I'm frequently camped by the enemy, my own jungler literally NEVER ganks. Instead of taking advantage of the prio that the ranged top laner has,  low plat junglers prefer to afk farm or to gank the losing bot lane just to die there.

Playing a ranged top usually means you will be camped by the enemy. Instead of trying to countergank, my jungler prefers to sleep. I wish low elo junglers would realize that you shouldn't focus only on ""losing"" lanes and that ganking winning lanes is a good way to snowball.",28,1585580901,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frshd6/why_do_low_elo_junglers_never_help_the_ranged_top/,leagueoflegends,0

You aa someone, you get mana. Less mana from minions. that is it.

Isnt there a way to still give him some help for his mana but make it either more challenging and rewarding or something that just needs a bit more interaction?

I was able to get one earlier this season, but it's been a while. Has anyone else experienced the same issue, or have you seen communication from Riot about the bug somewhere?

Maybe it's a little bit of vain hope that they'll put some work into providing free rewards that have been denied by a bug, but I'll hold out for now. Initially the collections page continued to show these champs as available to earn chests. Today at least, that is no longer the case, but no chests have appeared in my loot.

TL;DR: s ratings don't appear to be giving chests. collections page showed champs as ""chest available"" even after s ratings. the collections page has been updated as of a few days after gameplay, but no chests have been awarded.",4,1585577542,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frria7/s_and_better_ratings_not_dropping_chests/,leagueoflegends,1

so I’ve just started playing Sylas a lot more and am now considering him my main. today, I’ve had some mental games as him, going 18/2, 11/1 etc. and winning all.

now, I hop back on and in lane one game I vs’d a Zed and the second I vs’d a Ryze. I could not for the life of me make anything happen, I was just taking hits and bullied out of farm.

I’m Silver 2, Sylas is my favourite champ and I have incredible amounts of fun with him. I just don’t understand the inconsistency. Does anyone else have this? It honestly makes me re-evaluate the champion I main, which sucks because it took me so long to find a champion to call my main.

frrc0n,LordRedness,"[Rant] I've never experienced the EUW servers this laggy, and I'm sick of it","Over the course of the last few weeks, I've been stuck at home (like most people), and that leaves me with very few things to pass the time. Where League was already my main hobby before Corona, it most definitely is now. I'm lucky enough to live on university campus, since the wifi is both pretty stable and *really* fast. With a wired connection, I'll easily get to 800Mb/s up and down (yes, hard flex, I know). Overall, not too much to complain about  


But lately I've been getting this insane lag in my games. Nowhere else, just League. And quite honestly, I'm just so tired of it to the point of just finding something else to do (har-har, if I got a nickel for every time I said that). Call me spoiled (since I usually play on a ping of 10-15 ms), but I'm getting regular lag spikes of over 500 ms. The last few games, I even hit 3000 ms more than once. I've checked my internet connection again and again ([Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) screenshot below)

I really don't feel like playing anymore solely because of this. Especially since I and many others are stuck at home, I just want to play with my friends. But constantly getting the ""Reconnecting"" pop-up in my game is getting a bit too much for me.

TL;DR: EUW servers are too laggy in most of my games for me to properly play, contemplating to leave League, probably won't.

Hi, we are two League Coaches and high elo players.

We are looking to form a community for players of all types :

Those who are maybe beginners, experienced ones who want to have more fun, improve their skills and knowledge of the game.

frqvts,Flint124,Yuumi would probably be a lot less annoying if Final Chapter was a slow instead of a root.,"Yuumi is a healer who cannot be focused or caught out.

That's already kinda insane, but a massive AoE hard CC on top of that makes her a lot harder to deal with.

I think instead of rooting on the third wave hit, each wave hit should apply a small, stacking slow, similar to Rammus ult. 

To spitball numbers, slow victims by 5% per wave hit, lingering for 1 second after a hit.

Slows are still pretty strong, so it's not like this makes her unplayable (though that would be somewhat of a blessing), it'd just mean that Yuumi would have one genuine weakness in that she totally lacks hard CC, so you can largely counter her with Swifties.",5,1585575261,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frqvts/yuumi_would_probably_be_a_lot_less_annoying_if/,leagueoflegends,1

Just 3 days ago, i decided to join league and it really is fun and theres a few encouraging people here and there. 

But man is league toxic. I have been trying hard ti learn and have been watching videos and trying to get use to CS-ing and the different mechanics in game. 

But what saddens me and i think many players is that  there are players out there who would intentionally trash talk beginners simply because they arent good enough. Like sure i only have a 3/6/3 kDA and really kind of suck but jeez, chill with your 0/4/2 ""just uninstall the damn game jinx"".

All in all, i think once in a while its important to be nice here and there, like man, even high rank overwatch and tournaments in destiny 2 is less toxic then this intense question mark pinging.

frpl85,MooseMaster3000,Reminder: You'll be able to use Prestige Points for skins at the end of the year,"With all this talk about the value of the event's pass being reduced, it seems people have forgotten this little point. 

[All 2020 Prestige event skins will be available at the end of the year for Prestige points.](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/the-end-of-year-prestige-shop-is-open/) Unlike last year, when only non-event skins were available. You only need to grind for the tokens right now if you want the loading screen border. (I don't really get why people would ever want the borders, since all they do is clash with the rest of the loadscreen and cover the splash art. And they aren't even technically borders, but I digress.) 

What this means is that we, as a community, can outright refuse to buy a pass if we're not okay with them reducing the value. Even if we want the prestige skin. So don't buy the pass for this event, let them see that cheating us drops their sales numbers, and wait until they fix it next event.",29,1585570027,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frpl85/reminder_youll_be_able_to_use_prestige_points_for/,leagueoflegends,1

frpe31,FruitsEve,Looking for Advice How to deal with AFK farm ADC teammates.,"TL;DR: Most of my ADC teammates (Me:Supp) are afk farming ignoring my every engage, looking for advice how to play with them.

Hello fellow LoL players,   


After a long time of not playing LoL, I decided to give it a go again and it has been a lot of fun (but also pain).  


Im a Support main. I mostly enjoy an aggressive support style consisting of outpoking the enemy team out of lane, zoning for your teammates.   


My roster consists of these Champions: Fizz, Kayle, Pyke, Rakan, Ryze, Senna, Sett, Taliyah, Teemo, Yummi, Zoe.   


I know theyre not your usually picks. I use mostly Glacial Augment on Fizz, Zoe and Yummi while opting for Press the Attack on Sett/Kayle/Senna/Teemo and Dark Harvest on Rakan and Taliyah.

As i mentioned My playstyle consist of winning the lane trough zoning and aggression but 90% of my teammates (ADC) have ""AFK-Farm Syndrome"".  


I can literally engage to my death and they wont even flinch. They wont even try to basic attack a target which i stun-locked.   


So im looking for an advice from you guys. What should i do? Should i afk farm stay back and wait for the enemy engage? Should i zone only?   


Im looking to minimize my death count in the early game.   


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   


One last question though. Is this common? Even in ranked? Even in higher ranks?",35,1585569141,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frpe31/looking_for_advice_how_to_deal_with_afk_farm_adc/,leagueoflegends,1

frpbkx,TheBigChimp,"If Riot is testing new junglers, why not Singed?","The thought occurred to me as I was spamming some Singed top after rolling beekeeper, I’ve always enjoyed the champion and think his kit lends itself to jungling much better than top lane.

Q would let him clear well and reward good camp kiting 

W is a good gank set up and can be used to snare if you were to flash E 

E is a great gank follow up and disengage for some jungle fights by flipping over a wall 

R is R you go fast that’s awesome 

I think if Riot is retooling champs to let them jungle (I’ve been testing and enjoying Zyra jungle into some specific comps a lot actually) they should give Singed a chance as he’s pretty much only played by dedicated mains toplane, and is very, very matchup dependent and knowledge specific. Jungling would open up his dynamic as a champion, and while there would be champs who do what singed does better in some ways - Hecarim or Rammus for a run at them and kill - it is still something worth testing.

frp7u7,Xplosion101,Wall of text incoming! Just some thoughts I wanted to share about the state of the game.,"Before I begin, this is NOT a rant. More like an awareness raising wall of text.

I was looking forward to buying Dark Star Mordekaiser and get his border and Antimatter chroma as well, which essentially means that I will have to buy the pass on top of the skin. Well, I haven't spent money on LoL since last summer and I figured I could treat myself to something nice.

I pay primarily using paysafe cards, I've found the whole process to be rather secure and I'd rather not use my credit card if I can avoid doing that. So, I got my paysafe cards ready and was on the payment screen. And before I clicked ""Verify payment"" (or whatever the button said), I realized that I do not want to give Riot any more money no matter how compelling their new skins are. (And tbh they aren't even THAT awesome, it’s just that I know that Morde won't be getting another skin for a good 3+ years or so). Something the Lux mains among you won't even have to worry about xD

You may ask me, “why do you not want to give ol' good Rito any more money”? Well, the answer is not because I'm on a budget or anything. It's just that I feel that they need to try more to get me to give them my money.

Remember back when Dominion was a thing? They removed it. Okay, I get it, ""hard to maintain"" yada yada yada, I accepted it.

Then the rotating game modes got removed. ""Hard to maintain"" yada yada yada same story. I'm not saying they're lying, maintaining such modes when the champions and items constantly keep changing is hard indeed.

Then we got Nexus Blitz and I was having a blast. Best game mode ever imo, followed by Ascension. The minigame twist on the classic formula just... worked, and it made each game truly unique (and no, the S10's elemental rift hardly makes each game unique, Riot -\_-). But alas, it got axed, due to lack of player engagement (which puzzles me, as the queue times for me in NB were always much shorter than those for SR, but according to Rito that’s how it is).

Anyway, then new events stopped bringing along old and new game modes, the last one being Odyssey, which I regrettably missed :(

Examples include: the PROJECT game mode set in Substructure 43, the Star Guardians game mode, the awesome Dark Star Thresh game mode and many more.

After that, we got Prestige skins. Events became stale after this point, what some may call “cashgrabs”, through the introduction of Event Passes and uninteresting missions to accompany these. People bought them because they were compelled by the idea of a Prestige skin, which imho is just a golden chroma with recolored particles, and the fact that people bought them encouraged Rito to maintain this exact practice. Not to mention the Red ""Bundle only"" chromas.

They said that they will be bringing event game modes back in 2020 but so far, they've only been recycling the old ones randomly for each event. (I feel like the game modes aren't even relevant to the events’ themes).

Also, a while back you would get a skin's border for purchasing it early, when it launched. None of these “Available as an event reward” or “Get the border through the 2500+ RP skin bundle” things.

Then, Twisted Treeline was removed. Yet another game mode that was ""Hard to maintain"". We've figured out the pattern by now. And now we’re stuck with two game modes only (I’m not counting TFT. Personally, I don’t think that Riot really tried to fix the balance in TT. The last big changes they made were in 2016 if I recall correctly. And just like that, whoosh, Twisted Treeline is no more.

Recently, they shut down the official boards. ""Hard to maintain"", they said again. They aren't offering an official archived version. Some users had to do that themselves (kudos). The boards link now just redirect you to the LoL homepage. The important thing about this is that they are essentially also shutting down the dedicated PBE boards and shifting them to Reddit, but come on, we all know this is not the same. Personally, I think means that Riot may accept even less community feedback than before (which was already little, in most cases).

Login screens have been removed for a while now, and that I understand, with the new client and all, but I am still disappointed.

Now they also announced that they are changing how passes work, essentially reducing your token rewards and forcing you to play more. I think this is a bit extreme as a measure to make Prestige skins more unique.

Also, remember back when they said that they weren’t bringing URF back more frequently because it made players stop playing when it was over? Yeah. Okay, I get that they wanted to be honest, but are they essentially admitting to wanting to keep us addicted to LoL publicly? Seems like a not-so-good decision to me...

Moreover, the new client is another thing altogether. I would start talking about it here, but you all know what I am going to say and I will spare you from having to read yet another rant on how terrible it is, especially for lower-end devices. The same goes for lag issues, which I won’t delve into as it is against the rules.

Last, but not least, the report system doesn't work properly. I've seen players get bans for pretty minor offenses and players who you'd think deserved a ban go unpunished. A player literally called me ""a rape victim"" a while back and he said that he wouldn't even care if he saw me and my friends died. I sent a ticket to Riot support, seeing as this is the only way you can actually report a rule violation (the automated system is simply not good enough imo). They told me that they will look into it. A few days later I can still see that player playing games normally as if nothing happened. Come on.

Now, Riot doesn’t probably care about a single player like me. But still, I wanted to get this off my chest. I feel like the game is turning from a game you’d gladly pay for into a cashgrab. Could be just me, of course.

Sorry for the long post, but I've wanted to type all this for quite a long time. And thanks for taking the time to read this, you're awesome!

fro49v,PokelingLoL,"Why Ornn is so good (in pro play) and how to fix it, while not making him useless in SoloQ.","I apologize in advance about my English skills, for I am pretty young and my mother's tongue is Finnish.

&amp;#x200B;

(in pro play) included, since Ornn's win rate in SoloQ currently sitting at around 49%.

So here we have it, Ornn. One of the best if not the best champion for pro play for many reasons. Some of the reasons include:

* Loads of damage. This obviously isn't anywhere near to the actual problem in Ornn, but it is infuriating for a tank to have this much damage.
* Natural scaling. Ornn gets better stats from items he buys. This isn't really that big of a problem either and brings him the essence of a tank.
* His ultimate ability ""Call of the Forge God."" Here we have maybe one of the biggest reasons Ornn is so bonkers. In my opinion, this is the best initiative spell in the entire game because of its huge range and the fact that it is really easy to hit at least one target. If that wasn't enough, both hits of his ultimate apply Brittle. Brittle makes it so that the next immobilizing effect on the champion is 30% more effective. Ornn's ultimate normally knocks enemies for 1-0.5 seconds depending on who was hit first. This duration (assuming that the enemy has 0 tenacity) becomes 1.3 seconds and 0.65 seconds assuming Ornn hit the ultimate's first part and applied Brittle. After Ornn knocks his enemies up (heh) he applies another stack of Brittle.
* His passives. For some reason, Ornn has **four** whole passives; +10% MR and Armor, can craft his items during lane, Brittle and item upgrades. Oh boy, the item upgrades. I'm gonna have to go to another paragraph for this one.
* The item upgrades. THIS is what I believe, combined with everything Ornn already has, is what makes the champion so good in pro play. Ornn upgrades his own items (2 at most) at level 13. Most Ornn players build Abyssal Mask and Sunfire Cape totaling for a huge +3500g for free. This may sound alright for getting to level 13 but let's be real. Ornn almost always reaches level 13 and two items. Now starts the fun part. This is also the hardest part to balance since Ornn relies heavily on the meta to not be early game oriented to truly shine. If Ornn reaches level 17 however, he should have upgrades all of his teams' items. (1 per ally) This makes it so that on average Ornn will have given +7200g to his team. Imagine this: You're ahead by 5000 gold to the enemy team and everything is going nicely. Ornn hits level 13. Now you technically only have a 1500 gold lead. Alright, this still doesn't bother you. Keep going! Oh, he upgrades one of his team's items now! Assuming that the gold lead didn't suddenly increase, you only have a 300 gold lead now. It's basically non-existent. If you have a 5000g lead to the enemy team, Ornn will have that lead negated at level 15. That is insane.
* Then the second or the number one reason why Ornn is so good. His ability to be flexed almost anywhere. If the enemy team drafts a counter for Ornn top, you simply place him mid. Oh, they drafted a counter to Ornn mid too? Then play him support or even jungle! The fact that a single champion can be flexed into 4 different lanes is insane to me. Riot has themselves said that they try to balance champions in a way that they can only be played in two roles at most. This can also lead to getting a bad draft for the Opposing team of the Ornn. According to statistic sites, the biggest counters to Ornn are early game aggressive champions. Just imagine picking early game champions for both the top and the mid lane. Draft ruined.

I myself don't think that Ornn is 'badly designed' per se, rather he is just overtuned at the moment. I also absolutely LOVE the design of this champion. It also fits his lore really well and the champion just honestly looks amazing. Ornn also has some of my favorite I don't care -type voice lines in the entire game:

*""I don't know what you do and I don't care.""*

*""Whatever you want, the answer is go away.""* 

Also, his forging animation is adorable.

&amp;#x200B;

Now as to how to balance Ornn... He is a really difficult champion to balance well because if nerfed just a bit too much, he'll just disappear into the void amongst other champions such as Skarner. My suggestions are:

* **Nerf his tank item upgrades.** I don't really understand why he gets to have way better item upgrades than the rest of his team most likely will. I mean yeah, it's his passive but do blacksmiths really always forge better stuff for themselves? It's just way too good to have +3k gold right when you hit level 13. For comparison, Youmuu's Wraithblade gives only about +750 gold. Meanwhile, the upgrade to Abyssal Mask, Infernal Mask, gives about 1900 gold worth of stats.
* **Nerf his wave clear.** This makes it so that Ornn can't just easily get priority in the lane to help out his team with his huge ultimate. Ornn Q + W comes close to one-shotting the wave, not counting the cannon minion.
* **Give his forging a cooldown.** Nothing about his ability to make items in the lane is that broken since pros generally have good recall timing. It's just that it usually *forces* the enemy to look for a recall, thus giving him the possibility of gaining dominance of the lane's state.
* **Make the slow when his ultimate arrives less powerful.** It's just way too easy to hit right now in proportion to how good the ability is when landed.

This is what I would feel like it would take to truly balance Ornn for pro play. But then there's one big problem and that is **SoloQ**. We have to buff Ornn for SoloQ if we want to nerf him for pro play. If Riot would theoretically ship these exact changes through, Ornn's win rate would most likely drop down to about 45% in SoloQ. There's an argument to having Ryze, Corki, and Azir all always float around the 45% win rate margin but this is due to their high skill floors. This brings me to maybe my biggest point yet, especially for SoloQ: **Ornn is too rewarding for how easy the champion is to get a good grasp o**f. So *how* would we buff him then? Give his E some more power. It's kind of a weak spell honestly. Maybe give it a small tAD ratio or buff the cooldown a little. Make his Q's ""Volcanic Rupture"" pillar stay around for longer. This would make it so that it can act as an actual ability rather than a set up for an E or just the poke damage.

&amp;#x200B;

These are all just how I see the champion and I'm not a high-level player so these argument points will come from my perspective, hence why they may be incorrect to some degree.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Too flexible of a champion in pro play, needs communication to work properly.

&amp;#x200B;

And that ladies and gentlemen, is how I personally would balance and how I feel about Ornn. Thanks for listening to my TED talk.",7,1585563091,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fro49v/why_ornn_is_so_good_in_pro_play_and_how_to_fix_it/,leagueoflegends,1

JATT, KOBE, AZAEL, and MARKZ had them im playoffs DESPITE how terrible they looked all season and even after they were already down 7-10. When they were doing the STOCKMARKET thing on the analyst desk, and all stocks for all teams were available, we had KOBE and DASH going ALL-IN on TL stock and basically the entire analyst team only had stocks in 2-3 teams over the course of thw entire season. This huge amount of bias is eggregious of what should be unbiased casting. Shouldn't they too be fans of the sport and root for new teams and want new stories to add to the development of our sport rather than just keep hyping up the SAME team that won 4 TIMES in a row. I remember the days when TSM had won 2 titles in a row and specifically recall JATT saying he didnt want TSM to win a 3rd because he didn't want to see a dynasty set up in NA like SKT had in the LCK...so why is it any different for TL? Why are they so happy to see a team of 4 imports consistently dominate our region and look past rising starts such as the EG roster who are actually starting to look really good and why has TL been talked about so much more than C9?

While being bored in quarantaine, I tried out something new. The Sugar Rush Evelynn icon below was the template for my newest cosplay. I already made three other Evelynn cosplays, but I like this one probably the most due to its pink color.  
If you want to see more and specially League of Legends cosplays, I will be more than happy if you say hello to me on instagram.   
This is my first post and I am curious to get to know reddit 🍓❤️

While Darius at least have one mechanic in his kit Morde has none. 

I've seen dozens or maybe even hundreds of posts on Mordekaiser mains with rants that Morde sucks and his kit is oversimplified in comparison to the previous one, but riot has us deep in their asses basically we were 2%% of player base or even less. Some champions got shitty reworks and bcs of player base reactions got reverted even if the mechanics weren't that bad but Morde mains will be ignored completely as we are insignificant in numbers.

frncgy,Nhika,Another complaint post about damage and supports n stuff!,"Playing as ADC it's verrrrry hard to last hit. . when your support has no idea what he is doing.

There has never been a moment in time where my support is straight up baiting me to a point where if I have to be zoned out of minions the entire game. Even while under tower we can't do anything because he's. . not even pressuring?

Sure up in plat+ there are matches where players literally never fight, and afk farm because BOTH supports somehow managed to climb by being a healbot.. but down below that? 

I'm starting to see where the mage ADC role came from, because they can actually do stuff while kiting.. ADC's are stuck. . with what? Overpriced items?

This could apply to both roles, honestly. When I play support (because I'm digging the mage meta) the ADC is literally two screens away from me, I could be 1v2ing entire game poking them to half HP. But he will never do anything until . . . he can last hit. 

The game has shifted from laning phase, to bot lane being ganked by not only the jungler, but the MID roam style too. (Rumble mid, Assassins mid, Global ultimate mid laners (Twisted Fate, Lux (walks into river, shoots you under tower) Xerath, Velcoz). Top and enemy Mid laner run teleport too.

**Aftershock supports in dive meta** \- Another annoying rune that let's people take 3-4 extra tower hits.

**Jungler's with Dark harvest / Electrocute** \- very very easy to 100-0 an ADC that is level 1-10, taking a couple poke hits from bot lane? Dead.

**Mid laner's with Luden's** \- Another easy way to blow up bot laners, you can hit BF sword, cool. You aren't dodging a Luden proc'd Electrocute though.

I just wished the game KEPT runes.. but lowered the effectiveness with raised ""scaling"". Imagine if PTA scaled off of attack damage, or aftershock didn't make people invincible until they finished a tank item or something?

Conqueror mages are a problem, when they can do damage and kill people with tear/catalyst start, on top of having a niche hourglass item (counters big ultimates more so than the armor benefit). Imagine Conqueror giving no sustain, but gave healing after a certain amount of attack damage?

I'm just saying, everyone would enjoy not dying instantly and being able to build defensive items without looking like an idiot. To be able to play the game instead of being screen locked.

(Lethal items and Magic pen kind of tilt the game towards bruisers and full damage dealers than they do tanks). Because once your bot lane dies, you're next in this 3v5 lol.",1,1585558919,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frncgy/another_complaint_post_about_damage_and_supports/,leagueoflegends,1

frmp0n,DaveredRoddy,Feels good winning a game against a cocky guy shit-talking in chat.,"Happened in my Iron game. I was playing Trundle and the enemy top-laner was a Yorick who was shit-talking throughout the game.

He was against a Teemo and was getting kills on him.

After every death, he'd go /all ""EZ"".

Like not even small caps ez. It was an obnoxius E Z.

He got like 10 or so kills and kept on typing EZ 

EZ

EZ

EZ

EZ

EZ

Everytime. 

Him and his team got three of our inhibitors and we were almost going to lose the game.

Bastard in the chat goes like ""nice base""

Shit was infuriating yo...

But our chad Talon and thad Ezreal and lad Yuumi started popping off. They started one-shotting the enemy midlaner and absolutely annihilated their botlane. Yorick was online but the rest of the team wasn't.

I managed to secure 4th dragon and claim infernal soul.

We defended our base like crazy and dragged on the game longer than it should have been.

Then we were starting to win team-fights. I became strong enough to Troll club that shovel shoving dickbag to death.

Sometimes they'd win smaller skirmishes and he'd go 

""?""

Like hell I was going to let him win.

We pushed and pushed and by god was it annoying to deal with that Yorick's flame. But we managed to win.

Post-game lobby, Yorick was the first to leave.

frm2vg,Legolas170,Twitch is the only ADC in the game without any defensive teamfighting abilities,"I know, hypercarry, late game monster, etc. So is Jinx, so is Kai'sa, so is Aphelios and Xayah. The difference is that they have stuns , invisibility, untargetables, and roots. Since the change from true invisibility to camouflage on his Q, and with the addition of more assassins and gap-closers, it has been very difficult to play Twitch effectively in recent years. 

This has been mirrored in his LCS appearances and winrates. His lack of escapes means that you're forced to build Bork early(you can't afford to get chunked in the mid game and continue to farm). His ultimate no longer provides the range that he needs in order to engage safely, there are many champions that can easily close the gap, even from ultimate range. 

It would be nice if the slow on his cask was buffed, or maybe punished players who stand in it with a root(though thematically a blind would be more fitting) if they get stacked 3 times with the poison. Perhaps the cask could root enemies who are standing in it for the final tick, or if an enemy gets 6-stacked while on the cask. 

True stealth being restored to his Q would be the dream, but completely broken. 

Twitch was fine in 2016-17, but 3-4 years on from that point, the many new champions, most of whom have serious gap closers, makes life for all adc's hard, but Twitch doesn't even have the luxury of self peel in any form, unlike every other ADC, and he doesn't do enough damage to compensate for that.",61,1585551792,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frm2vg/twitch_is_the_only_adc_in_the_game_without_any/,leagueoflegends,1

frljyk,NateNate60,I think remake should NOT be changed to 1:30,"The reasoning is simple. A person who has disconnected due to a client issue will need to reconnect. Or maybe their PC crashed and they need to restart. Either way, 90 seconds isn't enough to restart your computer and get back into League before the game is remade. 90 seconds is pretty tight for restarting only the client, especially if your computer is slow, which it usually is if you're having these problems.

Therefore, I think 3 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to give someone to reconnect.

The notion that the game is automatically lost by starting a few minutes late is ridiculous.

Oh how wrong I was. If you can learn how to play support, learn where to ward and learn how to communicate, you will have a HUGE impact on your game. 

A lot of supports in low elo like to just sit in lane and farm up exp and place that trash bot lane ward (don’t ever do that). 

Lookup ward spots, make plays bot and roam mid, you will carry the game and trust me, it is so much fun. 

I was maining top lane, and my win rate was pretty much even and was ranking up very slowly. Recently I have picked up Senna.

frk4v2,InvisNunuWNotFixed,why i like gold elo more than i do plat,"hello there, this is a small story about me.   


my highest elo was plat 1 in season 4. i've been plat every season usually between plat 3 and 2.   


but do you want to know why i dont like plat and i prefer gold much more?  


because in plat if i dont play like my life depends on it, i dont have any impact. even if i go 8/0 in lane, i will end up facing 3 enemys that are also 8/0. plat to me is just no fun.  


in gold however, i can mess around a bit, play stuff im not maining and still end up going 8/0. and even if 3 enemys are also 8/0, theres a higher chance they mess up and i can abuse their mistakes.  


none of my friends get my point of view so im fine if you dont get it either. all im saying is in season 9 i started to play a strat that i know ppl in lower elo dont understand. aka i play lategame champs and farm up.  


even in plat i saw ppl play stuff like anivia top and try to 1v1 a renekton at level 2, only to go ""this champ is so op, fuck you all"" and then ragequit. (also advice: if you are in low elo and your team is mainly lategame champs, dodge). ppl just have no patience and no idea how to play safe. they feed early in their weakest phase and then wonder why they cant ""scale up"" against the 13/0 renekton.  


i started to play stuff like kogmaw, onhit yi, nasus. where i do nothing but farm for 20min. this makes me lose way more games and makes sure i dont climb.   


and its not even on me. every time my team manages to not go 0/50 within 20 minutes, i basically am so fed thanks to me being able to farm, i carry. but those are rare cases.   


so yeah. i found a legit way to not climb. its not trolling its a legit strat. and it keeps me in gold, the elo where i enjoy the game.  


  
and i know some comments will go ""why dont you play normals?""  


well yeah i mean sure. why do i not play a gamemode where i get a team of silver players vs a team of diamond players? sounds like fun.  


""you could learn from the diamond players and get dia yourself""  


yeah im learning so much from a dude whos dia 1 and clearly shows he has no problem crushing me and my team in every which way and just enjoys it to the fullest. i learn a lot when the dude is in the bush at the blue and our gold jungler runs towards his blue THREE TIMES and always dies because the dude IS STILL SITTING IN THE BUSH!  


  
normals are the worst in this game. its awful and i dont get how anyone enjoys normals.   


  
so yeah thats my pointless story that i wrote for... honestly no reason. i enjoy gold. enemys dont suck but they also dont crush me AND i dont have to go tryhard.",49,1585542097,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frk4v2/why_i_like_gold_elo_more_than_i_do_plat/,leagueoflegends,1

frjz6m,songxD,(LCK) KeSPA interview of KIIN and Keria translated,"Since there were no english captions for this interview I decided to translate it, as it gives some individual perspectives from the players of Afreeca and DRX.

**KIIN (Afreeca Freecs)**

The current situation after Round 1?

With round 1 finished we have some time off so we're taking the time to rest, but balance it out with some practise. Recently though we've been working on getting ready for round 2

How would you rate your play in Round 1?

As for my rating for Round 1... I'd give it around 7.5. The reason for the low score is because we lost some games where I could have done more.

Thoughts on patch 10.6?

Since I personally feel that these patches are aimed at making top lane more relevant in the game, I feel some pressure as I feel that I need to do better. I do feel that teams that have a better meta read get the results right now. 

The attitude (of Afreeca) towards the first online format of games

We're not doing any extra practise/preparation in regards to the online format. We're currently practising as we normally would. I'd say the one difference is the atmosphere of a practise room vs. tournament venue.

Are there any difficulties in preparing for the online format?

The method of preparation is not different, but I think there could be a difference in personal attitude. Since there is an atmosphere difference I think some players will be more comfortable, while others may find that comfort a little distracting (thus worse). 

A comment for the fans?

Since Round 2 is ending soon, we'll do our best to show better results than we did in Round 1. we'll also do our best to lock down games and not lose games we should win. Thank you.

**Keria (DragonX)**

The current situation after Round 1?

Since the term was long (the wait between offline to online) we didn't crunch our practise time, but since we couldn't tell when the matches will start we practised so we would be ready at any time.

Did you expect good results for Round 1?

No, we didn't expect it. Our mindset was to reach playoffs, but I think its good that we performed as well as we did for Round 1.

How would you rate your play in Round 1?

I'd say 8 out of 10. The parts that went well was that I was able to display individual plays that I enjoy and am able to do. As for parts that didn't go as well... I hate making small mistakes, but I think I made too many small mistakes in Round 1.

Was there any pressure on being named the best rookie for the season?

No, I didn't particularly feel that much pressure. I think that receiving attention for good performance is good, so I want to do my best to justify that attention I receive. 

Thoughts on patch 10.6?

The top side carry potential is stronger, but I think bot side still needs to perform and be reliable for the top side to perform, so I think all lanes still have a role to play. It's not like a particular lane needs to carry -- we all need to perform.

Projected result for Round 2?

Since I (or we? not specified) didn't expect to do so well for Round 1, I didn't have that much expectations for Round 2, but given our current results I have the ambition to reach the finals.

Are the preparations for the online format going well?

The preparations are going well. Since I also have confidence in my skills I think its going well. 

The difference between offline and online matches?

Doing offline matches was a lot of pressure which I think helped my performance, but I think having the mindset of offline matches being official can also give the same pressure? I'm not too sure yet.

frjvbx,PlagueDoctorJoe,Can we talk about mages [discussion],"I have a major problem with league right now witch is the same reason why I stopped playing last season and it's the fact that mages and their items need to change. I don't play mages often and when I do they are extremely easy now if any mage player are wondering I played swain(post rework) Taliyah, Morde, and ap Galio. I believe that mages have to many pros with cons that get insta fixed with items that don't cost that much. Zohnyas hour glass is one example with being able to fully stop anyone from attacking them while giving mages ap and armor. now the counter argument is well G.A dose the same thing for ad character but ad character items don't boost them as hard as mage items. Rabidons and viod staff cost give so much more ap in comparison to some of the ad items like bork, black cleaver, duskblade ect. Ad items also don't give as much as ap items, luden's gives alot of ability power, cdr and mana to stop some of the main issue with mages. Mages are supposed to have certain problems to make them balance like having ""long cool downs"" \*cough cough they don't\* and little armor and mana but most items  give these stats back. Their is an argument that oh assassins have lower cool downs and more mobility but that wont help when mages can buy ninja tabby and Zohnyas  negating their entire purpose. Their is no real way to negate a mage's damage because mr means so little now because of how little their is for how much damage they give. the highest mr item for ad characters is spirits visage giving 55 mr with anyone including mages can buy frozen heart that gives 100 armor. Now I don't think a mage will buy that but it wounln't be an issue if most items give magic pen and the more magic pen and ap you have negates the mr. I also don't believe in the mages have long cool down argument when most of the items give cdr and other benefits like mana, ap, mr... Burst mages and sustain mages do to much damage to the point where their is little to no difference when they both blow up non tanks in half a second, this applies to everything not only mages dying in half a second isn't fun and need to change.

frjq60,1Venom1-RH,"Riven isn't in a good state, and you can't argue against it","Riven isn't in the greatest state right now, in a lot of situations in 1v2s/2v2s(with jungler)/teamfights I'm like wow, I would rather have Irelia/Jax/Renekton/Camille in this situation rather than Riven. 

Riven has been cut at the knees with the changes in the past year but all people talk about is how broken she is. 

Her build path sucks because of the changes a long time ago to Black Cleaver, and recently to Deaths Dance

Her E CD was nerfed in response ( and a correct response at the time to be frank ) to old conqueror that had all the true damage/healing on it as well as when shojin and non nerfed DD were a thing. 

She isn't the best split pusher because her bonus damage on AAs don't deal extra damage to towers

She has no other type of damage in her kit other than physical compared to Jax/Irelia/Camille/Fiora

She has no armor penetration in her kit to help her scale, honestly if you buy tabis early against her in lane it hits her harder than many other champions

Conqueror was changed to something that has peanuts for damage now, and her nerfs were never reverted. 

RIVEN PLAYERS DO NOT WANT A DAMAGE INCREASE IN HER KIT, it wouldn't be the correct direction other than base stat AD buffs. The only request is the E CD nerf revert to have some semblance of what this champion used to be.",36,1585540268,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frjq60/riven_isnt_in_a_good_state_and_you_cant_argue/,leagueoflegends,1

frjotb,csudoku,Question about clash trophies,"So me and my friends did clash for the first time this weekend. We are usually very busy during the weekend and can't do something like this be because of the covid we were able to be less casual about playing. We played ranked 5s as a group and ended up ranked iron and bronze to prepare ourselves to for clash. Now in hindsight since 2 of us our highest has been plat in the past and 1 of us gold the other 2 silver we realized that bracket 4 was a bit easy going 5-1 the whole weekend so we won our sunday bracket (we will try to get to tier 3 before april 11th). Now I just read that our clash trophy only shows up on the rift for 2 weeks. Can anyone confirm if this is true or not? After the upcoming weekend of the 11th we don't know if we will be able to get together consistently to play clash or not and it would be a bit lame if we only had these 2 weeks to show it off.

frjafh,PlagueDoctorJoe,Mages are broken and need to be changed,Ok take this with a grain of salt but I view mages and their items truly broke. There are a lot of overloaded mage items that give them so many stats that are supposed to punish them like zhonnyas and ludens. The point of mages are supposed to be back line damage that shouldn’t one shot everything but they get so much stuff for buying 2 items. The highest mr item is spiritvasage and it gives 55 and ad characters get items that counter them that give 100 armor. The magic pen goes through mr so fast and there is no punish. There is on mage that gets punished for buying resistances when ad characters have to pick and choose damage or resistances. Assassins are made to destroy mages and squishier characters but now mages get almost every stat from their items making it really hard if not impossible to kill mages. Also this sustain bust mage difference isn’t real all mages blow up everyone to fast. Riot I know you won’t read this and every mage is gonna day I’m wrong but fix this.

frj4lr,batiumas3hj,The problem with Kindred's R right now.,"The purpose of Lamb's Respite never had a support hability purpose, instead, it was the typical defensive hability all ADCs have and had the purpose and potential for outplays in 1v1, 1v2 and even 1v3 scenarios, where you could actually kill someone, buy time for the ally team to arrive and then help you, Drake/Baron steal potential (one of the best things in Kindred tbh) etc.

In this patch, it only fits the purpose of ""let the enemy team get out alive and then outplay YOU"", since now it's an even more unreliable Ultimate for any of these purposes after 10.6. For instance, before the actual patch, when the circle expired, a 16 lvl champion could heal around 20% of it's max health (without health items) from a rank 3 Lamb's Respite, having around 30% of it's max HP at the end of it, getting easily executed with an E proc with one complete zeal item and one Cloak of Agility. Now, at level 16, everybody gets a healing of around 25% of their max HP (without health items), getting out of the circle with 35% HP (if they aren't using DD ofc), needing at least 50% crit and an IE to get executed getting out alive even when these requiriments are met. In pre-10.6, the average core build for Kindred had only 25% crit chance, most of the time an IE and with some bruiser items like BC and DD. With this build, if the enemy was only 10% and then received the 200-300 heal, you'd almost 100% sure that your E was going to kill it, because in level 11, without any health items, it was only 15-20% of it's max HP, leaving it with 25-30% (with 25% your E crits when the enemy is below 27,5% max health). Now, with 250-400, the values for a level 16 champion are: 250 HP = \~14%, 325 = \~18%, 400 = \~22,5%, needing 25%, 40% and 50% respectively (can't have any crit chance below neither between 20-25%, that's why those values are being expressed that way). Even with all those numbers, you doesn't have any guarantee your play will work, since people are getting tankier with items like DD.

I almost forgot to mention that now you heal Drake and Baron to a higher health amount, making smite harder to hit in the correct timing (again, not fun).

  
Note: I'm not considering stacks, only the critical chance since it's a harder stat to acquire.",1,1585537682,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frj4lr/the_problem_with_kindreds_r_right_now/,leagueoflegends,1

friy4j,Zazgog,Support - Access my Account / League of Legends Account vs. Riot Account,"Hey everybody, long time no play.

I used to be a HUGE LoL player back in the day, but I haven't picked it up for a couple of years now. I just reinstalled the app to my computer in hopes of playing some League and Team Fight Tactics in the midst of this quarantine we're facing. 

I knew that I wasn't going to be able to remember all of my login details, but when I searched my email for anything from Riot in the last years the only thing I saw was an email from a while ago saying to update the account from a LoL account to a Riot account by January, or else I won't be able to log in. Obviously, I didn't do this, because I wasn't planning on playing League at the time, also I don't really check that email because it's the one I use to sign up for things with email blasts. 

Am I SOL  getting back into my account? I spent a lot of time and cash on League back in the day and I'd really hate to have to start all over again with a new account from level 1. I'm working on a support ticket to Rito as well, but I wanted to see if Reddit could help me out too.

friwpm,Toomindu,"A discussion about LP loss and the term ""jng dif""","Hello guys,

**! Quick tl;dr: the sections with the arrows (-&gt;LP loss / --&gt; ""jng dif"") are the core of the post and the rest is even more explination of my experience on this matter. However, please be so kind and consider the NOTE section before judging/commenting !**

So this season i started playing ranked more serious than ever. I really prefer jungle but all lanes are in the end ok for me. But its not the autofill I want to talk about, but more how exactly the LP system works and, I guess, why it works like that.

My problem with this is, that I think it is not fair how it is distributed. For example, I think i had ok games, neither did I stomp nor did I really int, but my teammates just ran it down. I thought this happens once or twice, but the ammount of times it happend to me doesnt seem fair. So as usual, I play games and lose, which lead to me losing LP. So far, so good. But then the next game, I think I did ok and somebody goes 1/9. Eventhough I set up vision, pinged the jungler he was about to gank, the laner ignored that. When i asked him why, he himself said he ignores the map completely, why should he care. Next game, somebody goes once again 1/9. Pretty much same excuses. Saw their jungler, ignored them, died. \[Quick explination: I was either ganking or in base, ***and I definetely do not claim I play perfect!! or say that its always my teammaes!!!\]***

Then I get a derank, but i get some wins and I thought i finally broke the losing streak. When i won, I didnt gain the usual 20-23 LP, but i gained 17-19 when I was winning. I wont go over every single game now, but they were kinda the same: i played ok, teammates intentionally die \[""i dont care"" , or just bad plays that, even if you warn them, they just ignore\]. 

**-&gt;** I can finally get to my point now: I gain less LP when I win that if i would lose. And i understand the system behind that, but the problem in my eyes is: Isnt it obvious that if you play good and its (not only, but mostly) your teammates that run it down, you shouldnt lose that much LP? (AKA. why lose as much LP when playing good as when playing bad? (same logic also works for winning i guess)) I mean, just imagine the statline on the team would be: 0/9, 10/2 (you), 0/9, 0/9, 0/9 and you are playing the game mostly flawless, how exactly is it your fault? And why do you constantly lose more LP the more you get those type of games? 

**--&gt;**Another part that is just frustrating or really confusing: ""jng dif"".  People tend to use it just caus its cool, but mostly (for example a game with a 10/2 statline), it is obvious that you didnt lose to your counterpart, but it was more the ""mid dif"" or the ""top dif"" or whatever. This is also the excuse people tend to use for their inting. For example, somebody dies to a gank eventhough it was warded. You pinged it, they ignored it. Then you want to gank, but they keep pushing. As a result, they get ganked or get 1v1d caus they overextend. When you, in a kind way, remind them that you pinged them to retreat, they flame and then start to just keep pushing, keep dying and say ""jng dif"". The problem I see here is that ""jng dif"" is a term for ""I intentionally die but i know for a fact that its not my fault I ignore everything and just run it down, its the junglers fault"".

NOTE: So, answers like ""just play better"" or ""you couldve won it if you actually do something with the lead"" arent what I look for. I also understand that people have bad games or days where they just dont perform. But I talk about games where people themselves say that they intentionally die caus they just ""dont care"". The games I talk about are about people ignoring pings and vision and die as a result. For example, you ping a laner is roaming, they dont react and die (and somehow flame those who pinged to fall back?) or you are certain the enemy jungler is about to show up and you wont be able to be there in time, you ping them to retreat, they get angry and ignore you and die. These are the game I talk about, NOT those who are, well, I guess ""normal"" loses. And I talk about low Plat elo, so I guess you can expect people to care about vision/roams/pings.",1,1585536776,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/friwpm/a_discussion_about_lp_loss_and_the_term_jng_dif/,leagueoflegends,1

Anyone else seem to notice that recently if you pick a champion that is not played much in solo queue it gets picked even it has the lowest probability?
I have played 6 games in a row where it was either 3 or 4 against 1 and somehow if this champ has a low pick rate they win. I really want to see the system that is designed to decide what champion gets played. If these were good champions it would be fine, but usually it ends up being something like a Zed being picked into Rammus, or Yuumi vs basically anyone. I initially thought it might be that it picks the hero that has the highest score within the five players, but then picks I don't even own started turning up.

frinvj,Flint124,A rework for Jax,"**Passive: Relentless Assault**

Basic attacks grant stacks of Relentless Assault, up to 5, for 3 seconds (falling off every 0.25 seconds).

Each stack grants 5-10% attack speed. 

Scoring a kill grants 3 stacks. Stacks obtained this way can go over the cap.

**Q: Leap Strike**

Leap to a location near a target unit and strike them, dealing bonus physical damage and applying on-hit effects if the target is an enemy.

**W: Kindle**

Passive: Every third basic attack deals bonus magic damage.

Active: Reset your basic attack timer and ready Kindle's passive.

**E: Counterstrike**

Jax twirls his staff defensively for 2 seconds, becoming immune to targeted effects and reducing the damage and crowd control of skill shot effects, but becoming unable to basic attack.

The first time you mitigate a direct instance of damage from a champion, refresh the CD of Leap Strike.

Champions you dodge effects from are put *off balance* for 4 seconds, causing your next basic attack against them to deal bonus magic damage and stun for 1.5 seconds.

**R: Grandmaster's Flame**

For the next eight seconds, Jax is empowered by the flame in his lantern.

* Jax gains a decaying 30% movement speed boost.
* Basic attacks do not interrupt movment.

frin3n,AlphaTenken,Has a Pro Team ever closed out a game WITH first Elder drake buff?,"I feel like more and more, every time a team takes Elder buff .... they go back and reset the board.

I guess you can say the other team retreats and tries to stall it out, but the team with it also rarely engages or isn't able to.

fri49o,tempermentaltyrant-,thoughts on my champion pool?,"hello all,

i’m a Silver 3 player who lately, has had trouble deciding on a champion pool i can climb with and have fun climbing with.

i’ve played so many champs. at one point, i was playing Ekko, Qiyana and Talon; however, i stopped playing these guys for various reasons - primarily because i tried playing every champion in the game and found love somewhere else.

because i’m a Silver 4 mid-laner, i find myself getting filled at least once or twice a day, so for those fill roles i have 2 ‘easy’ champs that i can play on (e.g. Jungle - Shyvana and Warwick). 

my main mid-lane pool features 3 champions of which i have had the most fun playing: Sylas, Pyke and Diana. my main here is Sylas, Diana being my i guess, ‘easy pick’, and Pyke if my team ever needs AD. i play these champions quite well (aside from missing Pyke ult every once in a while), and are ultimately the champions i have been having the most fun playing on which in my opinion, is more important than the climb itself. 

i would like the opinions of some more experienced players, as I’ve only been playing for about 8 months and am not yet sure if this Champion pool (while it may be fun) is good enough to climb at least to Platinum Elo with. my reason for choosing Pyke over someone like Talon, is because i don’t believe Talon is in the best spot right now in the sense of he will probably be receiving more future nerfs than the already 10.7 nerfs. i prefer to play A tier champs rather than S tier champs because of this.

frhrfr,Rexsaur,When is the current state of adc going to be discussed?,"I feel like it keeps being ignored, tons of high elo adc players and streamers are quitting or swaping roles, like...

Tyler 1: Went from playin draven to playing mages bot to finally swapping to jungle.

Saber : Swapped to mid

Gosu : Barely even plays the game anymore exactly because of the current shit state of the role.

When the best advice others give you to climb is ""swap roles/dont play adc"" there might be some deep issues in the lane.

Problem is that its not only completely irritating to play but it also has close to no impact on most solo queue games, you need a support to have a playable laning phase, then if you do EVEN If you get ahead you need to pray ur solos/junglers are going atleast even AND they have to play around you for you to effectively ""carry"" the game.

What has happened to the game when a role like support has more carry potential than adc? Like what happened? I know what happened, every role has been powercreeped into the sky while adcs get nothing but nerfs over years, like 8.11 HAS STILL NOT BEEN FULLY REVERTED IN 2020.

Adcs get 1 shotted by every other role 1 item in while themselfes need 2 or 3 to finally become relevant, and at the same time they have the worst defensive itemization in the entire game, they cannot build defensively without giving up the entire reason they are played for, unlike mages or supports (the other squishy classes).

The only other role that was as shitty as adcs was top lane, but now that top has gotten like 4 patches worth of buffs and is now quite strong adcs have fallen even further behind.

Please, we need some attetion to our role, adc players deserve their role to be decent too just like every other is.",54,1585532147,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frhrfr/when_is_the_current_state_of_adc_going_to_be/,leagueoflegends,1

frhizc,tradtrad100,The problem with Garen,"See the problem with Garen is something which is unlike many other champions nowadays which is why whenever he is viable he is obscenely strong and pretty much breaks the toplane. He has no, and when I say no, I mean NO counterplay whatsoever. And I'm not talking about something like wave management because you could claim that for any champion, and is not champion specific.

Garen is a massive stat check abusing items that aren't for his class like Phantom Dancer, Berserker's Greaves and Stattik Shiv. This is because he has nonsensical scalings on his abilities such as attack speed on his E. Imagine the outrage if champions like Jayce or Aatrox who use abilities to fight, had abilities that scaled with attack speed. Only a few other champions  use attackspeed as scaling for other purposes such as Yasuo Q and we already know how broken he is when played properly, but atleast unlike Garen he has some counterplay.

There is nothing healthy about Garen's kit design, and so much of it is incoherent gibberish design wise. Riot is strongly against point and click champions which is why champions like Kayle, Ryze, Akali, Katarina and Warwick all got reworked to incorporate skillshots so the fact that Garen still exists is an absolute abomination.

The biggest problem with Garen is the fact that he is by design impossible to fuck up. This means he has literally no counterplay when fighting him, when behind it is impossible to ever outplay him and get yourself back up. You are hit with a 3 second point and click crowd control and can't even fight back let alone do something to prevent the crowd control. The entirety of the game has comeback mechanics designed within the game from bounties, to respawning inhibitors and stealable objectives so why is a champion like Garen even allowed to exist? 

Some argue that he is a beginner champion and as such should be easy since he costs little amount of Blue essense, but this is a bad argument because a lot of the cheap champions are old, with stale kits and have been reworked since to not be so braindead to play. Even Ryze. 

Here is a list of non-sensical implementations of mehcanics in Garen's kit which can be changed or removed to make him more balanced:

\- Make the movement speed on Garen's Q conditional for example such as actually hitting a target (also why does it break slows? Imagine if Trundle's Q broke slows and silenced.)

\-Make Garen's Q a skillshot similar to Kayle Q, where he lunges his sword, and if he hits something he get's the movement speed. Or maybe gets the slow immunity, if he hits something but gets the movement speed regardless.

\-Remove the ability for Garen's E to scale off attack speed (seriously what crackhead at Riot games thought this was a good idea).

\-Make it so that Garen's ultimate cancels if you go out of range from it, or reduce the range down from 400 to 150/200. 

\-Make Garen lost the movement speed buff from his Q if he actually hit's a target, or casts an ability such as E.

\-Make it so that his E doesn't multi proc conqueror (Yeaaaah that's a big brain interaction right there, inspiring Wukong Ult™).

\-Change his W to be something interactive and not just something that basically happens on it's own. Also why does this shield now? Makes no sense. 

Also why does Dr. Mundo exist when you can just play Garen. Come to think of it why play any other champ than Garen? As long as he's viable there's no reason to pick any other champ.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr

Garen has no comeback mechanics, no outplay potential, no fundamental game knowledge required to win lane because he has low cooldowns, no mana, and built in sustain all normal trade patterns and are void. His skillset is unhealthy, outdated, and a remnant of League of Legends champions of the past, and need a massive overhaul. Possibly just below Shyvana on the rework list. There is no way of playing around or against Garen and this needs to change.",18,1585531228,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frhizc/the_problem_with_garen/,leagueoflegends,1

frh1ym,MoeZaic99,What is the best LoL weekly practice schedule for someone trying to go pro?,"Is it 20 games a day? or does that ruin your mental, burn you out, and make you 90% autopilot?  
Is it wake up at 4 am everyday, exercise, meditate, play 10 games and review them?  
Is it spreading out 4 days where you play x amount of games / review each day and spend the other 3  
  deliberately learning from youtube edu content or solo q / pro games?  
Is it just to find a coach online and not worry about anything else?  
etc. etc. etc.  


Assuming someone has all 168 hours a week to their self, what should their schedule ideally look like factoring in sleep, (exercise), eating, etc. What's the hardest / smartest someone could possibly work to get the best long term results? Where is the line between working so hard that its not smart and counterproductive and working smart but less? The more in depth the better, there's not much content on the internet about this topic.

frgt2h,YumaS2Astral,One of the main problems with Katarina is that counterpicking her is of little use,"You can pick the hardest counter possible to Katarina. You may go as far as picking something such as Nautilus mid just to hardstomp her and prevent her from snowballing off you.

But it simply doesn't work against a good Katarina, she will always roam and get fed off your teammates, and then she recovers and can either beat you anyways, or outscale you in teamfights.

Directly beating Katarina on your own is almost impossible, since counterpicking her is not enough. You must also have a team that is coordinated enough to avoid dying against her when she roams, AND to keep her in check during teamfights. You must start preparing to deal with Kat ever since the champion select. If your team does not have enough hard CC to deal with Kat, you will lose. And even then it must be reliable hard CC (that is, no skillshots like Ahri's charm, for example, I am talking about things like Fiddlesticks' fear) otherwise your team may still lose. Even then, your team may still lose regardless if you aren't coordinated enough to stop Kat.

Katarina isn't too difficult to beat in the lane phase. Although her early game all in is strong and she is manaless (which is annoying to deal with when your champ is gated by mana), there are a ton of champions capable of denying her lane phase, if not outright stomp her.

But almost none of those champions, if not none of them, can match Katarina's roaming power. If she is capable of beating you in lane, it is even better for her, because she can snowball even harder. But if she cannot, she can just roam and kill your teammates, and recover.

Yes, a ton of assassins can also roam and kill your teammates. However, none of them have the combination of Katarina's resets, AoE damage, and snowballing potential. A Zed could do the same thing, but he wouldn't be able to snowball as hard as Katarina, and it would be much easier to deal with Zed in teamfights than it is to deal with Katarina, especially considering that Zed's ult not only is AoE, but it is hard countered by Zhonya/Stopwatch/GA/untargetable abilities like Fizz's E/Vladimir's pool.

That is the main problem with Katarina. It requires ridiculous amounts of team coordination to deal with her, something that is extremely difficult to find in SoloQ. This is also why she is not nearly as powerful in pro play, so you don't see her that much.

As a matter of fact, according to u.gg, Katarina boasts 52,65% winrate with a pickrate of 8,3%, which is already a red flag for a champion like her. She also has about 10% banrate, which is high, although not as high as champs like Wukong, Darius, and Yasuo (currently the three most banned champions). She is also a S+ tier champ. I don't believe it is because she is a pubstomber (broken in low elo) - She also has more than 53% winrate in Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster, with a decent pickrate in all those elos. Only in Challenger she has a 47% winrate. That said, Challenger is a small sample size so it may not reflect her true strength there, especially since Challenger is still SoloQ. Source for all those stats: https://u.gg/lol/champions/katarina/build Funny enough, despite being considered a pubstomper, Katarina actually has a low winrate in Iron, Bronze, and Silver.",28,1585528468,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frgt2h/one_of_the_main_problems_with_katarina_is_that/,leagueoflegends,0

frgrd6,ihateschool2,There is no regular way to find people to play League with anymore,"There used to be chat rooms in League client, you could join them by typing specific  chatroom name, and I remember during the bonus IP weekends or  events, these chatrooms were very active and you could aways find people to play with there. On EUNE where I play I know for example if URF was out you could join at least 7-8 chatrooms (URF, URF2, URF3...) they were always flooded with max players so you had to dig till you really find one empty.

With them being removed and clubs taking their place that was the end of easy way to finding players to play with. 

You could also make a post on League boards that you're looking for players to play with but the boards are now gone too.

There even was a thing in the old client where you could see your previous 20-30 players you recently played with and could invite those people but that is gone now too (you can still see recently played with when you go to ""add a friend"" but u can't invite them from there to the game).

Even after you finish a game today in post game lobby, for some reason u can only invite people from your team to your next game and not the  enemy team.

Riot really should consider something official where you can find people to play with, and I get it there are probably a lot of 3rd party ways of finding people but that can get too complicated or whatever. 

What do you guys think do you agree with this or not? Feel free to speak up if you want

frgb1v,zhangju531520,thoughts on the Wukong rework !,"So i'm a person who reads patch notes on a daily basis, so i the Wukong rework came to live server, I am not aware at all, so well, as the usual, I decided to hop on to few games just to start the day you know. When I was in queues, Wukong was picked or banned, and I was like ok ? not untill when i faced Wukong, and that w with r level 6 give me nightmares everytime.

Wukong rework honestly is a very great change on Wukong, it makes the character more uniquely attached to the original character on the Chinese legends, The abilities are now more based on the clone rather than a meat shield before the rework, The passive stacks armor based on the attacks on clones, and the clones also mimics the ultimates when it was casted, it really feel like Riot has unlock a whole new mechanics on Wukong. For my personally, compare to Xin Zhao's rework, Wukong's rework offered more ways to play the game than 1 combo dead, or fall off, but I also feel like it kinda knocked over the balance, because characters such as Renekton are now no longer countering Wukong as much, as I try out wukong for the second game facing an Renekton, I really just had to sit back, and then I will do more than him late game. So I know that the rework came out pretty recently before the coming of fiddle, so it is more likely that Riot will put readjustment for Wukong adside first, so I made this post tell you guys how I think there should be minor adjustments on his stats because if you played with an Wukong top, 9 out of 10 you gonna have a hard game .",5,1585526614,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frgb1v/thoughts_on_the_wukong_rework/,leagueoflegends,1

frfzdb,Lex_the_Grim,What is going on with Maokai Support's winrate?,"I've been monitoring the stats for the last two patches and he's been killing it in the support role with around a 53% winrate. It's got a pick rate of 1.6% at the moment as well, which is significant enough to consider the numbers decently accurate.  


It's not due to the Fasting Senna strat either as the vast majority of his games are Relic Shield starts.  


Honestly I'm surprised no-one is talking about this, I've been looking around but I've been seeing no posts or articles on it.

frfu6u,GlorpHuester,Nasus should not be getting buffed,Title. First off I’m here to say I’m okay with buffing champs that aren’t doing well in the meta but buffing a champ that’s whole kit relies on dragging the game out for as long as possible is not healthy for the game. Playing against a Nasus has virtually no counterplay and the longer the game goes on the harder he is to kill because he infinitely stacks on his q. I don’t think Nasus deserves a buff bc he is not healthy for the game period. I’m not sure what is going through ritos head but buffing a champ that can int the entire game and still be huge af is not healthy for the game. Please don’t buff this brain dead champion bc it’s only gonna make the game worse.,25,1585524911,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frfu6u/nasus_should_not_be_getting_buffed/,leagueoflegends,1

frft59,JurgenJKC,Reward players for staying alive,"Hi all,
I was thinking and realised that lol, give us gold by several actions: farming, killing, supporting and destroying. But what about not dying in combat or staying alive.

To further explain, each kill gives x gold and increases when the killed has been on a spree.

But what about not dying, yes this helps us scores A or S, but not gold.

So what 'm suggesting is: award players with x gold for x minutes of not dying, for example:

5 mins = +5 gold (per 5 seconds) 10 mins = +10 gold and so on as a supp amulet. (Numbers needs adjustments, as players give more gold for killing spree when killed so does this one's and the ones bellow).

And: award players for escaping dead.

For example 1 vs 1 champs fight, but the who's losing manages to scape with:
50% health gets 40 gold.
25% health gets 80 gold
10% health or less gets 120 gold

(It could have a counter like kills, dead and supp's, also both champs or the champs involved in the fight gets this as long as they have lost enough health)

I believe it would be more rewarding for champs like tanks and supps this way, and would add more flavour.",9,1585524811,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frft59/reward_players_for_staying_alive/,leagueoflegends,0

Several months ago, maybe even a year ago, one of my bastard scum-fuck best friends made a remark about the proper nomenclature for Jayce’s weapon, referring to it as something that I found to be quite unpalatable.


Now it’s been a while, and while many IRL and discord arguments were waged between voice channels and dinner tables, the debate hasn’t been active in quite some time.

frfpe2,Whitestride,Why was it a decision to buff botrk for a class it wasn't meant for?,"The item was meant for ADC's to take down tanks in the disgusting meta's where tanks were too overloaded and took over quickly. remember zac with cinder? or shyv cinder top? i do... it was awful.

Personally i think the item shouldn't be a staple for bruisers, they already have cleaver which is LOADED on stats, also many other items aswell..

if anything the botrk should do MAX % dmg as a ranger, to at the very least have a fallback to go on when you're literally 0-0-0 and can't do any dmg versus a bruiser who doesn't let you move at all.

frfe8v,A_Cannibal_Baby,Why do the rotating game modes seem to have so much more toxicity than regular games?,"Like, I've never been one to be toxic or rage in chat, I rarely even type anything. But, I can at least sort of understand why toxic behaviour appears in ranked. People want to climb and losing a game means losing LP and losing progress and the competitive nature can mean that tempers run high.

Which is why I'd always been exicted when the rotating game modes come back as they are a nice fun little alternative with no real stakes and therefore a more chilled way to play league. Win, lose, it doesn't really matter; nothing is lost or gained. It's meant to be fun.

Or so I thought.

The reality that I've seen in this iteration of OFA and the previous iteration of URF is that each game has had at least 2 people completely losing their shit and taking it out on the rest of the team or the enemy team.

Anyone else notice this? Maybe I just get unlucky and happen upon the 1% that are toxic, I dunno. All I can say is that from my experience, the toxicity is through the roof and I'm just super confused as to why so many of the people playing these 'fun' modes are, for lack of a better phrase, complete cockwombles.",3,1585523320,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frfe8v/why_do_the_rotating_game_modes_seem_to_have_so/,leagueoflegends,0

I screamed and ran back thinking I was getting invaded and then realised that the update isn't live yet. My premade was just very confused why I screamed into his ear lol

Did this happen to anyone else? Maybe you got screenshots?
I figured it'd be something like the than kench teaser, where you heard his voice when you died in river.

frf01f,imreallybutthurt,Smurfs in Clash," 

So I was playing clash with my friends today in tier 3 and we made it all the way to the finals. We were really hyped because none of us had even made it this far in clash before. We were pretty confident because they had 4 silver players and 1 gold player and we had higher ranked players overall. We get in game and get absolutely demolished. We are all pretty confused post-game so we decide to look the up. Turns out that 4 of them were either diamond or plat last season but none of them had played a single solo/duo game, just flex. It based them off their flex rank because none of them had played solo queue this season. They won clash yesterday and today because of this and the games, in my opinion, aren't even close.

Here's is my [op.gg](https://op.gg/) for proof - [https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=newcoupenewshoes](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=newcoupenewshoes)

I get it, his premade (though unranked rn) ended up being low diamond last season, so maybe their \*\*average\*\* MMR could be somewhere around high gold. Also, the enemy team had a silver guy. That being said, I believe such MMR variance should not be allowed.

Honestly, what fun is it being matched with two premades of two players, including a premade of last-season-diamond and a 17% wr silver 3 guy.",2,1585521766,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/freycf/matchmaking_needs_some_serious_adjustments/,leagueoflegends,1

frerqf,Swailwort,Rammus is the only true god,"This post was made in response to the Ornn post by u/pkrf.


 Ornn is no god, Ornn is a pathetic waste of space, thinking he can lube his way into the enemy team, when he is nothing more than a joke.


Meanwhile Rammus, yes, Rammus, that rolling thunder of death and destruction, completely doesn't give a damn about what he has in front of his spiky self. He Will roll, he Will rock, he Will rock you! He just runs towards the fight, and makes people kill themselves at the sight of his ENORMOUS SPIKES. They just thing ""Ok"", it's a simple Tank that only rolls and does nothing. 


BUT THEY ARE WRONG, for they mistake the simple mind of a rolly Boí for weakness, but Rammus outsmarts their outsmarting. Rammus destroys their oposition before they can decided what to do, Rammus rolls and tramples over the enemy structures where they hide. And Rammus only has to say one thing, instead of talking and talking to cover his weakness like Ornn.


Rammus only needs one thing.

frelfs,shepherdhunt,Qualms of Elise,"Elise has been a champion that I really enjoyed when released and only been let down seeing her played now days. She is a must early game win early jungler as well as a burst mage but her role seems to only be allowed in the jungle with almost no flexibility. I really wish that some form of rework would happen for her. Her ability, volatile spiderling, should send a spiderling out that at it's death then blows up after 1s delay. Her lvling up her ult should give her a larger super spider that then transfers to the volatile spiderling bonus damage by sending it out. Allow it to even possibly roam like kalista ghosts to provide small vision with 325 movement speed. Always wanted her to be able to take an ability live ivern too to allow her to create her ""lair"" where she places webs that give movement speed and slows applying to her abilities or such but only can cover a smallish area and has a timer.

Just my two cents ideas to help Elise because most games I ever see her I expect a loss, I would even give it a 70% chance of a loss though I know it's not necessarily reflected in her u.gg stats.

frdmfz,Haldrin26,Why don't skin shards combine into a full champion unlock? (and other thoughts),"I began playing LoL again after maybe 8-9 years when TFT set two was released. The most aggravating thing I found when I put money in and I bought the last pass was that I was immediately under the impression that I was collecting these shards to combine them into a full champion unlock. I didn't find out until after I had already spent a considerable amount of my Mechakingoms rewards on random champion shards that you can only use one shard toward a champion. Why? That makes no sense. I know you can disenchant, but that's not how you should have to use them. 

It should be like 3 shards for 450e champs, 4 for 1350e, 5 for 3150e, and 6 for 6300e. And if you have say 3/6, you pay 3150 and consume the shards.

It's also annoying that when you buy a champion, it doesn't tell you if you have a shard to use toward it. Accidentally bought Urgot and then went to my page and saw I had a shard. Seems like something they could easily fix.

Here are some other thoughts after coming back:

LoL:

1. You should be able to buy multiple things of the same kind in shop at same time, not one by one. For example, if I use my galaxy tokens and want to buy a bunch of random champ shards (say I just began an account and this is an efficient way to get a discount to unlock champs or one week trials). I should be able to just select how many I want to buy, rather than having to forge, then scroll down and find it again 10 times. 
2. The client is still very buggy. I think part of this has to do with interacting with my blitz app. But even when I don't have it up, it still has many issues like runes not saving and stuff. 
3. Why do we stop gaining any points in beta for tft?
4. I’d like to see more missions for my event pass. I completed tons of them, but I’d like to see more of them in the later weeks too. It should keep being worth the cost of the ticket for people who play a lot.
5. If you get an XP boost as a reward in the pass, you should be able to decide when to use it! What if the reward pops up and then I have to either not play to not trigger it, or I get it and then I’m gone for the next three days?
6. Champion shards and skin shards for things you already have should be in a separate section
7. There should be other rewards than just key fragments for positive team play. 
8. Is there nothing that can be done to help in DC or griefing or inting or AFK 4v5 situations? Same as ten years ago. I do like the bonuses for positive team play and the reporting system. Still a pretty terrible situation. 
9. It takes too long to get to 30 for ranked play. Should be dropped to 25, and the low ranked tiers should be expanded to 5-6 tiers. Normal draft pick games are often just 4v5 or a smurf account (or someone that was banned) that makes games little more helpful than AI games.
10. Favorites for bans and picks - would be nice if you could just favorite a few and put them at the top.
11. Game constantly gets stuck in “concluding game”
12. I love the new rune system (I dunno how ""new"" it is). They are a great addition that allows you to play champs in very different ways. 
13. When  you put out patch notes, put what date and time they go live.
14. Why in the hell is it possible to ban your teammates’ pick? If someone has the champ selected, just make it override the ban!",2,1585517045,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frdmfz/why_dont_skin_shards_combine_into_a_full_champion/,leagueoflegends,0
frdm9x,safaripeople123,Playing with a highly toxic friend,"Hello everyone,  so in a past week me and my buddy have been playing a bit of league. Last time we were at it together was 4 years ago (we are returning players). We play mostly normal games and tft also some arams get into the mix. When we play 5v5 together I usually go top or support and he goes either jungle or adc. The issue is that I am not very good at the game and I am just trying to get the feeling for the champs that I was or at least I thought I was good at 4 years ago. For instance, today I tried playing Ornn. I was not doing very well but he did a few ganks and we scared off the enemy top laner. Later on, we fell short since we lost all dragons, mostly all our lanes lost and so on. The issue is that all he does when someone makes a poor decision or doesnt do as he says, he starts cursing and pinging like a mad man. I try to tell him that it is just a normal game, but he insists that there is no point of playing if we lose. He blames everyone on the team and it gets really disgusting. I was thinking that at some time I would like to play my placement games, but playing with him could be a disaster and really stressful. 

My question is, should I only play tft and arams with him and go play normal 5v5s alone to better learn and understand the champions or should I just get over it and dont pay much attention to his behaviour?",4,1585517026,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frdm9x/playing_with_a_highly_toxic_friend/,leagueoflegends,1

frdauy,Throwaway2314579304,About Clash's Bracket System,"Am I the only one who thinks the current bracket system is extremely flawed?

&amp;#x200B;

Most any competitive sport/environment uses a double-elimination system where you get put into a losers' bracket (NOT Riot's ""consolation bracket"") where your team can still have a chance to make a huge comeback to first or second place.

Sure, this may seem arbitrary at first, but between today and yesterday my team lost first round both times. That alone feels awful, as our team is now locked out of placing anywhere above 5th despite having never faced any of the other 6 teams in the bracket. 

More importantly, the enemy team in the consolation bracket BOTH of these times immediately conceded, leaving my team to wait an hour or more for the following game. And, sadly enough, I really can't blame them. They lost one round, and instead of the ability to pull a reverse sweep, they're completely locked out of placing above 5th place no matter how well they perform.

Surely I'm not the only one who feels the current bracket system is unnecessarily punishing and feels really bad, right? What is the benefit of using these brackets instead of the normal double-elimination?",5,1585515903,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frdauy/about_clashs_bracket_system/,leagueoflegends,2

But now he's reduced to a support with the changes one year ago. His R and Q don't do enough damage like they used to, all they had to do was change swain soul fragments mechanic but they just butchered him from solo-lane position to support role and even nerfed his AA range to 525 from 550.

frcp0n,JLXKS,What Unique Champion Would You Create?,"**Ok Check It**

Lets say, league of legends was different, every new player start the game by designing their own unique champion that no one else has and that champion would be the only champion they could play on that account. So essentially every player would have a unique champion with different abilities, If you could create a champion and this champion was the only champion you could play on league of legends ever, what 4 abilities would you go to war with? Below is the champion I would go to war with, I like helping my team while at the same time, making life very difficult and annoying for the enemy team.

**My champion: Support Mage/ Lets call her Sereen :)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Equipment: Wand and Orb**

&amp;#x200B;

**Passive:**

Healing plants on the map are 0.5 times more effective on you and your allies, after 3 minutes 1 healing plant will spawn behind allied turrets. 5 minute cooldown. allied turrets that have fallen do not spawn healing plants.

**Q Combat medic:**

· Generate a bubble that bursts on top of the enemy and deals AOE damage and Leaves plants in the surrounding area, Your allies can attack the healing plant (green) and recover health and the mana plant (blue) to recover mana. Enemies can walk over the plant to destroy them but are slowed by 20 percent in the process.

**W Cursed Phantom**

· Unleash a curse mark on the enemy, while curse enemies next attack (auto attack or ability) will lower their defensive stats for 2/3/4/5/6 seconds.

**E Mages Rage**

· E1 Wand: Empowers your wand and your next auto attack will deal bonus damage

· E2 Orb: Empowers your Orb, select an ally to shield

**R Final calling**

· Global Ult, The judgement cloud will identify every enemy champion in the area regardless of whether they are in fog of war or not, and target them. So its basically a karthus Ult/ GP ULT/Xerath ULT, but only in a selected location on the map. While casting the caster can not move, so its best to cast in a safe place. Ult can be used to soften up the battlefield, or clean up after a big fight. If R kills an enemy Health plants will spawn at the location of their death.

**How It Works**

· R1: select where to cast A Massive Judgement Cloud In a large radius in a selected area, this is seen as a darkened version of the MAP, kind of like nocturne ult.

· R2: Recast R after you have selected the area you want to create the judgment cloud, This will activate your ult and the map will turn darker for enemy champions, the judgment cloud will determine if the average of enemies under its gaze are relatively high health or low health, It will only chose one route. If it is used to soften up the battle field before a fight, enemies are msot likely very healthy, the judgment cloud will do more damage to champions above 50% health, If it is used after a fight, enemies are most likely low on health the judgment cloud will do more damage to champions below 50% health.

**Lets Have Fun!!**

frcnbl,SpartanDumpster,Skins Idea: Halloween Costumes,"I had this thought, what if when Halloween comes around some champs get skins that are them dressed as another champion? It shouldn't make them look too much like the other champ, not to the point where you'd forget it's a skin when things get intense. The costume's should be convincing though, more than just clothes. For example, Garen and Darius could easily dress as the other believably, but since they're of a similar physical build, they could look too much like each other. Mordekaiser and Nasus might be too similar too, specifically Nasus dressed as Morde.

One I thought of that I like would be Sejuani dressed as Shyvana and her boar would look like Shyvana's dragon form, so she could come out of the jungle and you wouldn't think ""I better watch out for her fireball, no wait that's Sejuani!"" I could also see Shen dressed as either Kennen or Nocturne looking fun. Udyr could be dressed as Volibear. I also thought maybe Gnar could have his fur dyed like Warwick, and when he transforms either there are just splotches of black on him or he just looks like a giant Warwick.

More funny costumes would be great too, like Rumble dressed as Kled and he just has a cardboard Skaarl head taped to his robot. Zoe dressed as Olaf would be hilarious, she has her hair pulled around to her face to be the beard.",8,1585513625,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frcnbl/skins_idea_halloween_costumes/,leagueoflegends,0

frcg09,MultiRichHyenaz,Good Boy Warwick - Warwick Skin Idea,"Hello everyone. With the ongoing quarantine, a lot of ideas tend to run through the minds of whoever gets bored, right? Well... here's one. Formerly known as ""UwUwick,"" I have u/Jaidenr333 for the more suitable name ""Good Boy Warwick."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory:   
A while back I had this idea about how Rengar mains have their adorably vicious Pretty Kitty Rengar and I thought to myself; ""Why can't Warwick have a skin like that?"" and so I crafted the idea of Good Boy Warwick/UwUwick and posted it on the Warwick Subreddit. After reading the comments and seeing that the feedback was mostly good, I decided to make a few adjustments with a little help from u/LunarEdge7th. After a bit of polishing, it was time to bring the concept here in the hopes of getting attention from Riot. With that said... here's Good Boy Warwick.  


Good Boy Warwick skin details:

&amp;#x200B;

Appearance:  
Warwick but his fur is the same color as that of a Siberian husky. He's also wearing a t-shirt with a bone for a logo in the middle and his canister is half a chew toy with the squeaker visible at the top. This squeaker canister goes through a hole on the back of his shirt where it's covered by a rim. He's also wearing a collar that has the initials ""K-9"" on it. His right arm is bandaged-wrapped from his wrist to his palm with only his fingers and claws left uncovered (something like how an MMA fighter bandages his fists) and metal clips hold the bandage in place.

&amp;#x200B;

Recall and Unique Animation:

Warwick's ears stick up like on his joke animation, but then a tennis ball bounces towards him. He then catches it and sits down as he rapidly shakes his head with the ball. He looks up with a goofy grin before the tennis ball deflates with a comical balloon sfx. Just before the recall ends we see his smile drop and realization hit him. When he arrives at the fountain, he drops his head and ears down before he whimpers and gets up again.

u/LunarEdge7th's idea for a dance animation: Warwick looks up the air and a Teemo Tibbers plushie falls from the sky. He catches it with his teeth and he proceeds to shake it around with matching sfx of a dog growling while thrashing a stuffed toy around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Spell effects:

P: His basic attack sfx is that of either a dog scratching through a wooden door or a sack of dog food (depending on the target). The particle effects are little streaks of rainbow colors flying out.

Q: When he bites down it sounds like he's biting a dog treat in half, and crumbs of the doggy treat fly out of the target. Q-hold does the same effect.

W Passive: When he's on a blood trail but he's not following it, the animation of him walking around with his nose up in the air comes with sound effects of him sniffing around. The color of the blood trail is light brown and the symbol above a blood-hunted target is that of a doggy treat. When his running after a blood trail, his eyes glow light blue and drool is running down his jaw. Blood hunt music is somewhat cuter but the growling stays the same

W Active: The same animation as the original, but the squeaky toy makes a sound and a cloud of light-blue smokes, chew toys, and doggy treats rise from the squeaker, and all the fur on Warwick's body not covered by the shirt stands on edge. The W passive animations apply.

E: The chew toy on his back rapidly vibrates as it produces small, rapid, squeaking sounds in the same way you rapidly squeeze a chew toy. When the fear is cast, a long and loud squeak is accompanied by his usual howl.

R: Something akin to PK Rengar's passive and attack where the indicator could be a bubble and a rainbow streak follows him as he flies before attacking him with the new attack sfx.

&amp;#x200B;

Chromas:  
The shirts change in color based on the usual chroma colors like Obsidian, Catseye, etc. But his fur changes resembles that of other dog breeds like the Samoyed, Burmese Mountain Dog, German Shepherd, and Doberman Pincher. For the W eye glow, the chromas give Warwick an eye glow similar to how each dog breed has a unique eye glow when light is flashed on them.

frce6i,Coletheblackranger,I hate Garen and EKKO so much,"Not only is this champ ridiculously tanky, Garen gets to be the king dueling in the game. Nobody is allowed to touch him, maybe beacuse hes a mascott of the game. Additionally Garen gets a free point and click true damage ULT to oneshot your carry with the click of a button thats why his winrate is so high, give ANY champ his kit with overtuned numbers theyre are instantly broken, why pick any other champ? when you can jus free win with this champ, flash in R whoever you want theyre dead no need for cc jus give him a couple kills it ignored armor anyway. the next nerfs you have planned for him will not be enough.

&amp;#x200B;

and also EKKO? this champ has been absurdly unbalanced and the whole community has definetely mentioned how his R is on a 20 seconds cd basically late, with insane escape impossible to catch with high burst. Nobody enjoys playing against him its not even like he outskilled you like a YAS, or Azir or Zed. hes pure cheap. needs a nerf.",5,1585512734,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frce6i/i_hate_garen_and_ekko_so_much/,leagueoflegends,0

frcc1n,Imeanttodothat10,What if Clash was a season instead of a tournament?,"Clash is the most fun I ever have playing league. I am sure a large % of the player base feels this way. Everyone brings their best, and it's just fun, no matter if you are tier 4 like I am. However, I think it can still be greatly improved. I think it would be even more fun if instead of doing a single elimination tourney, we could be drawn into 10 team ""seasons"". I think it would be pretty simple to do:

* You would keep the 4 tiers for teams
* Each team would sign up for a time to play their weekly games (could have 2 timeslots options Sat, and 2 sunday, for instance), and your 10 team league would be matchmade from this timeslot + tier combo
* You would play 2 games each weekend just like LEC/LCS. Play each team twice over the season
* At the end of each season, we would do a clash tourney like there is now
* Rosters could be expanded to 7 players max to allot for peoples schedules, you would have to lock your 5 man roster in 12 hours before your match (or something)
* Teams that forfeit too many games would be ineligible to participate in the next cycle or something

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would be the most enjoyable league of legends any of us would ever play. We could see what our opponents tendencies are over the course of the season and gameplan our matches. It seems like this framework is not much different from the current clash in terms of code needed, and I think it would be far better.",5,1585512545,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/frcc1n/what_if_clash_was_a_season_instead_of_a_tournament/,leagueoflegends,9

fral0c,TheAgonistxX,Changes to the Report System Cannot Come Soon Enough,"I could very well be the only one that feels this way, but I'm putting a lot of faith in what the devs said they would change later this season. I love league, but the in-game community ruins the fun.

I play a lot, and I watch a lot of streams. It truly seems as if the vast majority of the games are decided by intentional griefers. Whether it be rage splitting, troll building, ""gg ff im done"" at the 5 minute timer, or just straight intentional feeding, it's just so often. I'm average elo, but I still  want to play legitimate games of League of Legends, whether i win or lose. But it seems those games come with such low occurrence.

I report all griefers that do their best to force a loss for their team, whether on my team or not, and I would assume a decent amount of players do the same, so why is there still at least one of the types of players in nearly every game that I play or see played? You can mute rage flamers, but you can't mute griefing.

I could be making a mistake by having so much hope in the upgrade that is coming later this season, but I really hope I'm not. I really look forward to being able to enjoy most of the games I queue up for and spend my time playing, rather than sigh in disappointment at the same game-ruining occurrence that happens in what seems like 80 percent of games. And I would hope I am not the only one.

fr9yjl,moody_P,Juggernauts are more interesting when they have workarounds for low CC,"Rather than just being given CC. 

It's obviously a lot easier to just throw them a stun or a hook and call it a day, but the last couple of juggernauts have had this recurring issue where they're effectively replacement tanks thanks to their abnormally high CC and disruption (Urgot pre-nerfrework, Aatrox at his peak, tankMorde's ability to hit R and remove someone from play for 7 seconds) that, combined with their class-defining damage potential, sets them up as being too well-rounded to *not* succeed.

Personally I think it's just very boring and leads to a lot of them feeling very same-y; Aatrox is only any different because of his gimmicky Q, but Sett literally just feels like a less fun, more powerful version of Volibear and Udyr since he has similarly ridiculous burst with better lockdown, better innate sustain, and his generous disruption potential. Mordekaiser's base kit feels like Garen with a pull, and they have the exact same gameplan of standing on you until you die. (Garen's just faster to killing you) 

I think Riot had it the most right in 2015-2016 with Illaoi and Yorick; they have no way to lock you down at all but Illaoi's proxy hook and Yorick's mini-cage provide ample disruption+pressure and make them more than capable of being viable without needing any hard CC or permaslow tools. 

I'd prefer it if CC on juggernauts were used more sparingly as a specific ""high moment"" of their kit like as an ultimate or a counterpick-y tool like Volibear's E rather than just being their default way to make fights happen on their terms.

I've played this game for four years. First three years on a very old PC, the last year I've even been playing on a non gaming laptop of all things. (With a gaming mouse and keyboard plugged in)

I play minimum of three games per day, but can play up to like 15 games. 

So, other than maybe once per 30 times of trying to access my Loot I need to click shop, then re-click Loot again otherwise it wont load. Then one in every 20 games I need to reload client which takes less than 30 seconds. That's literally it, in 4 years I just get these two issues sometimes on old hardware with thousands of hours. There are maybe a few tiny issues over the years that quickly fixed themselves that I cant even remember.

fr9klu,jakksto,LoL punishment system - Why even bother,"Just a quick input from my side,

The baning system as is at the moment is just bad and wrongly set up. Here is a few ways how it could be improved:

1. When a player ints maybe some dedicated riot employees would help that would review replays? That would help a tremendous amount but yea probably wont be done since money has to be invested.

2. Why ban toxic people from playing the game instead of just restricitng the chat? First of all just do quicker bans and secondly why would anyone who just flames get a perma ban? I mean sure if they int and troll no questions but if someone just flames how about a month or even permantly disabling the chat? Instead they ban you from playing the game for ever.

3. Just fyi no i have not been permabanned for flaming but the mentality this is pushing is just perma banned and then he makes a new account and flames again... How about permanently disabling chat? He would not make a new acc and never be toxic since he literally cannot type but yea i guess that will never be implemented.



Im just sick of having toxic teammates every game. And i mean every game, they probably get suspensions and perma bans but just permanently ban them from chatting like please dude the amount of lvl 30 flame accs i have seen is just absurd

That would really be a easy implementation and would improve the community alot.",8,1585502928,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr9klu/lol_punishment_system_why_even_bother/,leagueoflegends,0

fr95u1,Extreme-Tactician,The elements surronding League makes it a hard game to stay invested in.,"The gameplay itself is good, balance asides. It's everything else that's bad.

The first element is the client, and the myriad of bugs it has. The constant slowdown and glitches are legendary stuff that aleays happen. This alone makes it hard to keep plating League if you aren't already invested. If you can't actually play the game properly, you won't stay. It's why I stopped with HOTS and Black Desert Online.

The second element is the absolurelt broken matchmaking. I'm sure we've all been hit by smurfs before. Makes for a boring experience if they are on your team, and a infuriating one if they're on the enemy team. But the amount of mismatched teams I've played with is staggering. Like 10 of my last matches 30 matches had bronze and gold players in the same team. And the skill difference was obvious. Why would their MMRs be so similar?

The third element is the broken report system and toxic community. I get it. Riot probably gets literally thousands of reports per minute. Automation ks the only way to go with these sort of stuff. But how people who constantly pick troll builds or have an extremely negative score get off scot free? The amount of leeway with toxicity you can get is amazing too. You can say so much insults, yet never get punished because you didn't swear or use a slur.

The fourth and fifth things are the rewards for playing well and punishments for being a bad teammate. The honor system is flat out disappointing. You get key fragments, and some blue essence. That's it. Your reward for being a good teammate is currency and a key to open a lootbox. But wait! If you aren't honor level 2, you also don't get ranked rewards! Isn't that a good incentive? No, it isn't. If you don't play ranked, that doesn't matter. And if you do, all you have to do is not use slurs and swears. And boom, you'll never be honor degraded.

But what about the punishment? Leaverbuster is flat out inconsistent. I've been hit by leaverbuster even if it wasn't me who triggered a remake. Even if I voted on it, and there were only 2 votes. Just as long as I was afk for like 1 minute. But I sometimes don't get hit by it when I get disconnected. What about chat restrictions? Also inconsitent. I had 3 games where I wasn't chat restricted for some reason during my punishment. And they counted for games played with chat restrictions. I have never been banned, however so, I cannot speak from that experience.

The last one I want to about is the reconnecting but losing LP thing. This goes especially for the reconnecting bugs. You'll feel angry the system is punishing you for even trying to play the game. Why bother to reconnect, if you get leaverbuster and lose LP and feel humiliated?

Anyway, that's why I think it's hard to stay invested League. What do you think about how hard it is to stsy invested in League?",2,1585501476,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr95u1/the_elements_surronding_league_makes_it_a_hard/,leagueoflegends,1

fr900c,oliwiakisiel,Drafting proposals Ardent,"Now the finish line is very good for initiating supporters, supporters relying on the defence of an ally have been pushed out of the finish line and are not among the best.

That's why as main supporters they offer you a change of Ardent which will not make it too strong and will help the supporters protecting your ally a little.

&amp;#x200B;

They propose to add 1% Slowdown per second when an ally or we attack an enemy (only when the Ardent is active).

&amp;#x200B;

Although this is not a huge change, it will help keep the distance between us and the initiators and help to escape the ally.

&amp;#x200B;

Percentages can be changed to a fixed number, or you can add a stake-out, for example up to 5 times

&amp;#x200B;

And if that were to come out, I'd ask that the slowdown be given by the ardent. (To have the support also included in the statistics, as it was his slowing down)

Im working on learning some things about jungling so i can try to carry myself out of there but, still, how do i play in those types of matches? I have only the free characters, so i was playing with Morgana that is a character that i think   
i really got the mechanics on point and trying to play it out casually wasnt working, i was clearly better than those two on bot, but it was impossible for me to keep up all the time. I know maybe my game sense isnt that good, im working on it, but any tips on how should i play it out when teammates just play whatever, for example 3 mid. I would like to try roles like mid, but right now its pretty much impossible, i want to try jg because i think no one jg on this games, and even if someone does, i think i can get myself ahead of him if i practice the mechanics of certain character.",4,1585499478,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr8lm1/trying_to_play_solo_for_the_first_time_goes_wrong/,leagueoflegends,1

fr8bif,NoDuckNoReddit,Worst Clashexperience ever (thanks to german internet),"Hey guys, this will be just a small rant to let off some steam. Maybe i can find some fellow germans or even maybe other nationalities with the same issue. This clash felt so f*cking unbalanced due to matching german players vs players around EU simply because german internet connection to the servers is trash and completely boomed. I dont mind the overall stable 70+- ping in all countries which wouldnt change too much about the gameplay/game experience. But having several seconds inputdelay/stutters every few 20-30 secs or 1-2 minutes which drastically change the way you play (int) made it such a pain in the ass. The other foreign teams were able to play normally tho. So basicly just a freewin for them. I dont see any reason to play league or clash in the next weeks due to that and its annoying cause i have so much spare time. Plus its not only lol, other games have the same issues.

I dont know if there is a possibility to fix that other than matching germans vs germans only. but i know that this is not a realistic option and fix for the problem. 
I just hate our own government for that cause they dont understand the importance of good infrastructure und never did in the past.

fr85lr,TacoBroDude,Proud to be silver and can't care less about being better,"As title says and also after two matches in norms including a 4 man pre-made that criticized (and in my perspective, flamed me for every mistake I made), just came to the conclusion that I don't really care for being ""top-dog"" or part of some clutch players or something. I'll admit that I'm not good with map awareness or other characteristics typically affiliated with the silver division, but I am willing to try and improve in these areas to the best of my ability.

Actual reason I'm posting this though is probably just another reaction to what I see is toxicity/flaming/bad-mouthing/etc., but just don't get what the point is to try and really push someone's buttons by insulting another player's close relatives or of the sort just because that person is doing bad in the game. Could care less about people flaming me personally or my playstyle, but when they start going after other people despite not knowing them or the player, kinda feels a bit infuriating.

With all of what little I've said so far, I could care less about climbing out of silver. I'm just comfortable being where I'm at. Numerous times now I've encountered other players that just flame others and tell them stuff like ""this is why you're silver"" or ""lmao people like you are why I can't get my smurf account past silver 2."" Most obnoxious ones are when there are those players who say ""my main is diamond 1/gm/etc."" but yet their ""smurf"" account is level 100+ and they still go to claim they have other smurf accounts. What i post here won't matter or make a difference, as it's just another small rant from another Silver elo player.

At the end of the day though, I'm just saying fuck it. I love League for its concept, character design &amp; stories, content, and various other aspects of the game. But this solo queue mentality coming to norms and ""smurfs"" flooding into lower elos, climbing the ladder becomes less of an interest. Also with other hobbies and personal IRL tasks, remaining in the elo I'm in is fine with me.

fr7v7s,Thegg11,Winning in low elo with proactive plays.,"To escape elo, do I have to strong arm my team into making the right play? As in, if they dont do what I want, I will do it my self anyway, let me list some scenarios and what I would do to get my teammates to stop inting. This is from the supports perspective, but can apply to other laners for most of the examples.

* ADC doesn't recall when they should

I will tell the to recall, or I will abandon lane. If they don't, I support top or roam with jungle for the rest of the laning phase because the ADC is unreliable.

* Teammates run into their team 1v5 again and again and again

I will say that I will split push the rest of the game if they get caught again in a stupid way, then do so when they do. Regardless of what champion I play

* Teammates refuse to go to baron when its the right call

I will say I am soloing baron unless they come, then get executed by the baron if they refuse to come. Same applies with similar objectives like dragon/elder. I don't play champs that could reasonably solo drargons.

* Team refuses to take towers

Say I will tank the tower shots if the tower doesnt come down with the minion wave alone unless you guys help me take it, then get executed by the tower if they don't.

The only way to win in low elo is have vastly superior mechanics, or to force the enemy team to do what I want. This is what I learned from my last coaching session, I can't play along with the team when they make a dumb play, I have to be proactive and force the team to make the right play.",20,1585496779,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr7v7s/winning_in_low_elo_with_proactive_plays/,leagueoflegends,1

fr7oz1,MooseMaster3000,"3/4/5th hit and cooldown-reducing passives need to be on-attack, not on-hit","These effects are only coded as on-hit because all but one of them were designed before Sated Devourer's Phantom Hit passive existed. No one expected they'd make an item that interacts with them the way it did-- the way Guinsoo's Rageblade now does. 

The solution is to make these effects properly considered on-attack instead of on-hit. Because they already did it to one champion. Azir's soldiers haven't been considered an on-hit since the patch the effect was put on Rageblade, for reasons that should be obvious. Yet despite abuse of the effect on par with what they preemptively removed from Azir, many champions have not gotten a similar change.

Even after it was abused to the point they felt the need to reduce it to every third attack instead of every other attack. 

But if *n*th-hit attacks and cooldown-reduced-when-you-auto effects were properly recoded as on-attack instead of on-hit, that problem would cease to exist. Then the champions could be properly adjusted around their own kits instead of how they interact with one particular item. Perhaps the Phantom Hit effect could be reverted back to the more intuitive every-other-hit design, but it may not be necessary.",0,1585496116,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr7oz1/345th_hit_and_cooldownreducing_passives_need_to/,leagueoflegends,1

fr6r0f,hallopeoplegmail,Thoughts about League’s latest developments from a guy who spends money on gacha games,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM.**

In recent times you can stumble upon multiple complains about League becoming more and more of a gacha mobile game as it keeps committing to decisions that are… questionable at best.

These complains become louder as time moves on. While thinking about it I had a reflection “hey I played way too many gacha games in my 20something years lifetime and spent money on several titles”. I decided to create a thought experiment – **What if I was to judge League of Legends and its mechanics the way I judge regular gacha games?**

Some may question my sanity for spending money on gacha games, so I’ll quickly explain why and when I do. Short answer, my spending is response to liking things game is doing atm with its story, characters, mechanics, or if I particularly like certain decisions by the devs about further development, ~~or buying pretty jpeg dress for my waifu~~. I have applied this philosophy to pretty much every game I played. For example in League I liked Odyssey, so I bought 20 orbs to show that content sells, I liked Nexus Blitz, so I bought event pass to show that content sells, etc.

Coming back to the topic:

Looking at the League as gacha game… oh boy – **it’s bad**. League is terrible at being gacha game and not in a positive way. From the get-go I have ran into multiple problems, which now I am going to explain.

**Problem no. 1 – increasing prices.**

You may be surprised to see this as the very first I’ll talk about. However, it is important to talk about it first. Increasing prices is big no-no in gacha territory, especially when talking about successful games. If prices in successful game are changed it’s either a drop OR the amount of “bonus” currency you get for bigger purchases is increased permanently. What you want is to show your payers that their purchases brought better quality of life and make them feel rewarded. Perfect scenario is creating thoughts which go like “well, game may still be expensive, but at least now I get the same value for 5% less!”. Price increase has entirely opposite effect to what you would want to achieve, you are making your payers question trust they have for your product. You are hurting budget players and making f2p players less willing to maybe try giving you money while trying to milk whales.

**Problem no. 2 – Lack of drop rates and drop tables of chests in client.**

While Riot disclosed their drop rates 1,5 years ago, which is bloody long time after releasing them, but better late than never. You could think “cool, what’s wrong?” There is one glaring issue with drop rates and drop tables I don’t see brought around often – you can’t check them in client. Let me rephrase, you can’t check qualities of a product in the place you are buying this product. You have to go to support site to take a look which is extremely shady move (and even then you can accidently skip over special rules like I almost did). Even in case of orbs, which show some of their content in a client, all you know is “there is a chance”. This is a bad move below modern standards and wouldn’t pass in gacha game (mostly due to most gachas being of eastern origin and certain regulations in place there).

**Problem no. 2.5** – Oh, there is also one little issue. **There is nothing indicating that special rules apply to Event Orbs.** All these rules are talking about hextech/masterwork chests, no orbs. Which means that rule “Equal Odds” (saying that there is the same chance of rolling every rarity) MAY NOT (and propably doesn’t) apply. This is pretty scammy if actually correct.

**Problem no. 3 – Lack of meaningful pity timer/exchange/similar mechanics.**

Gacha games often have mechanic in place which makes sure that after certain amount of rolls without high rarity drop you are more likely to roll high rarity drop (example, Fire Emblem Heroes), so called pity timer. You may also have different approach. For every roll you can give currency, which can be used in exchange which either lets you buy whatever you want from “base set” (example, soon to come out Pokemon Masters), or has a rotating exchange in which you can trade (example, Azur Lane). There are also other approaches (if I remember correctly Dokkan Battle had a special all SSRs banner in which special currency was used, this currency was rewarded to everyone depending how many rolls they did on their account). Either way, your goal here is giving payers the sense that “if I spend just a little more I may get it” or “oh hey, I am getting something back for spending” while also minimizing mental damage due to not rolling thing you wanted.

Let me start by saying that “Bonus Gemstones” rule (which guarantees gemstone at least once every 50 chests) is pretty much the only pity timer in this game. Calling “Bad Luck Protection” a pity timer doesn’t feel fair. It’s not a pity timer, it just guarantees that 1 in 3 times you will earn reason why you bought the chest from the chest (if there are people who buy chests for emotes or icons, you are free to correct me).

While some could argue that Equal Odds rule (if it works for Orbs, for the sake of avoiding chaos, we will assume it does) makes such thing unnecessary – everyone who happened to roll chests in this game will tell you that rewards feel either extremely shallow with some rare jumps of excitement. There is a lack of… participation award?

“But wait!” – you say – “Isn’t orange essence technically participation award?”

**Problem no. 4 – Orange essence is worthless without shards.**

Orange essence in itself is quite a decent concept actually, because it makes everything you drop from the chest/orb have some value as you can disenchant it and exchange for something. However, there are major issues with implementation. You cannot exchange it for anything, only upgrade shards you already have. On top of that, orange essence isn’t “participation award”, it’s necessity to get anything out of chests in the first place.

Value of orange essence is relative to skin shards you have. You could have million of it and no skin you want to craft, which would make it completely worthless for time being, or a shard for your favourite skin and no orange essence which would make it priceless. This isn’t healthy state of things. So how to fix it? Introducing a weekly rotation of skins craftable for orange essence (without need for shard) would be a good step in the direction of healthy design (so I doubt it will happen).

Either way, orange essence seriously fails the entire “participation award” part, hard.

**Problem no. 5 – Most events are just weekly/monthly missions.**

Events in gacha games can be exciting time. New characters to roll, stages to fight through, new enemies, bosses and so on. Obviously, the difference in genre is a thing, but events in gacha games also do things which could pretty much be part of events in every other game – pushing story ahead, expanding lore, giving characters development, putting characters in spotlight and giving us some funny banter.

Now, Riot has proven that it also can do it and it has endless possibilities. Odyssey was (for me) hands down best event in the game. Riot has multitude of skinlines with their own lore and history. It has endless possibilities for events that give us things mentioned above without touching the chaotic ever changing status (whatever-devs-are-thinking-at-the-moment) quo we call lore. It was proven it can be done and haven’t been done since. This is a huge shame because Riot is sitting on goldmine of scenarios due to mentioned mountain of different skin lines.

Nowadays standard event in League is what would refer to as weekly or monthly mission in your regular gacha game, without anything fresh going on.

**Problem no. 5 – Event passes are just glorified premium mode.**

Honestly, at this point it feels like monthly subscription more than anything and should be renamed to it. Event pass has exciting sound to it, like you were supposed to go on adventure or something, while in reality it’s just boring bonuses. 12.5 dollars/euro isn’t that bad, if not for the fact that *pass alone is not cost-efficient from the get-go*. For example, assuming that you’ll only buy the current pass without playing you are losing on 200 RP value. Now, I admit I haven’t seen many iterations of premium type service in gachas, but these things tend to be relatively good value (when compared to other proposed options), which also give more value on top. Just a little bit of corporate greed that will be overlooked by most.

**Problem no. 6 – Little Legends are their own beast made out of issues.**

This is one of the things that pushed me towards writing this post. 5 bucks for roll is ridiculous. Inability to **view freaking rarities on variants in client** is plain scam. Not putting drop table in client is shady. No universal lvl up earned through gameplay (which is INDUSTRY STANDARD) is inexcusable. Egg series structure is combining literally everything that is bad about League financial model. I would like to say something nice, like 5% for legendary isn’t bad, but the fact, that you gotta do it 3 times to max out your little legend, pushes it straight into Fate/Grand Order territory of bad rates. This entire situation just makes me angry, so let’s move on.

“But muh high quality model must cost.” Without checking I am sure that rolls are cheaper in Honkai Impact 3 and it’s got similar quality of models last I checked (albeit animations seem less fluid). Correct me if I am wrong.

**Problem no. 7 – Eternals are just dumb, even from financial point of view.**

At the time I was writing this post, Riot was still determined on making this premium feature. Now, this could have changed before you got to this part, but fact is Riot tried it once, it will probably try again even if it fails. Mark my words, we’ll see faction progression system in the future for 2825 RP.

Okay, but what so wrong about the system from gacha point of view? The fact that you WANT progression systems to be free, because they make payers invested. Invested payer is more likely to spend money. Invested payer who spent money will stay around for longer and spent more money. By locking progression behind paywall you are questioning payers investment, potentially losing part of your payerbase, part of your income and decreasing your future income.

**Tl;DR**

League is terrible at being gacha, it uses many outdated point of views, scamy tactics, and fails to do one extremely important thing people making gacha games understand – it fails in investing. Whoever is in charge can’t seem to grasp that invested payerbase, which is kept happy, is long term much more important than short term profits as it makes sure you’ll have constant influx of new people due to recommendations and people will be more willing to spend money on game that seems more “fair”. There will be a day when it all crashes, because in order to get short term profits right here right now, League disregards investment in state of playerbase. Which in this day and age of gacha games is really stupid, long-term borderline suicidal choice.

fr6bkn,Neville_Lynwood,Please stop complaining about ping and connection issues during this quarantine,"I know it's crazy but internet bandwidth and server capacity is a limited resource. And half the human population forced indoors are putting a strain on every ISP and all servers across the planet. Strain none of them were designed for.

Furthermore, the guys supposed to manage the traffic are also stuck indoors. And while some can work from home, not everyone can. People still need to physically interact with the hardware and during a quarantine those things are heavily hindered. 

This also means repairs and maintenance of landlines and such is also hindered. Outages will be more likely and take longer to fix.

On top of all this, new hardware is harder to come by. Not only are a lot of factories across the planet closed, so are countless airports. So you can't just make one call or click your mouse a few times and have a new set of additional hardware at your doorstep the next day.

No, you may in fact not see any orders for months because the quarantine makes it impossible. Borders are closed, cargo transport heavily hindered.

ISP's across the globe are kinda fucked. And those ISP's control how your signal moves. Before you even begin to blame Riot servers, know that the ISP is the one who decides whether your signal goes straight to Riot servers or takes a detour halfway across the world first.

And odds are many ISP's are NOT prioritizing connections to Riot servers. Most likely government and health organizations are at the top of their lists, and afterwards it's more likely streaming sites like Netflix or Twitch are up next.

So even if Riot does everything perfectly, odds are that your ping will still be shit, that your connection can still drop.

So please calm down and realize a global pandemic affects everyone. Whether you sit behind a computer all day or not.

fr6b1b,Pequeno_loco,Stopwatch should be removed from the game.,"I don't think it's as much of an issue for solo q, because fights are far more frequent and a single stopwatch generally won't decide games, but in pro play it's honestly just annoying as hell. It makes fights so damn predictable, because the team with more stopwatches win. It's to the point where it's more important than gold leads, because if you lose a fight, blow stopwatches, and even if you've otherwise kept the gold mostly even with macro and objectives, you are at a huge disadvantage the next fight. The enemy team can just recklessly run in, throw out their abilities, play agro, play frontline, get focussed, stopwatch at low health, then flash out, and the next player can repeat the process, preventing anyone from getting dying while the enemy team no longer has the luxury of doing the same. It takes away the risk vs reward players often have to make, and a big reason why comeback fights from behind are so much more rare, when your support Naut, top lane Ornn, and jungle Sej can engage, zone, lose most of their health, and just stopwatch then flash before they die. 

I think the item should just be removed from the game, or at very least from item builds like GA and Stoneplate. Make the gold cost a real risk vs reward choice, instead of just a game changing item that you will eventually build into a really strong full item anyways. Players are already are rebuying it after upgrading if they haven't used it anyways, so obviously they think the item is easily worth the 650 gold alone.",378,1585490489,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr6b1b/stopwatch_should_be_removed_from_the_game/,leagueoflegends,1

fr5tgo,spooTJK,"My experience being a 'toxic' player, and how to not be one.","When I played League a while back I would describe myself as a toxic player. Someone that would flame whenever I did something wrong, and my teammates were not at fault. Even if they were I would still be toxic. Recently I took a break from the game and came back and let me tell you it's a lot more fun now, and I have come up with 5 easy steps to stop being 'toxic' and possibly win more games :)

1. Find a word to type in chat if feeling angry at a point in the game. I recently found that if I die frustratingly, I will just type 'XD' into the chat.
2. If you can't manage this, mute-all at the beginning of matches or disable all chat. (Interface settings)
3. Take breaks, if you are tilted before a match you have already lost. That is a mentality I like to have, take a break, go and exercise or something else you enjoy other than league.
4. League is a game about improvement and teamwork, so remember that people are at different levels in the game so try and put yourself in their position. Would it be my fault if I was them? How can I stop this from happening next time?
5. This has been said a lot, but remember. It is just a **game**. No matter how much you want to rage, remember that real life is not based around dying to that top lane Darius three times in a row.

That is all from me today, good luck in the rift summoners and have a safe quarantine :)",11,1585488160,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr5tgo/my_experience_being_a_toxic_player_and_how_to_not/,leagueoflegends,1

So how about making it that you need to have earned at least some points, maybe 5000 or 10000 mastery points on a champion before you are allowed to play it in ranked?

This way you dont ruin others ranked games, and atleast show some respect for others about it.

Now should this only be for lower elo (below gold/plat?) players? Or should it matter for every rank? Hmm this i havent thought of. So maybe others have ideas about this?

#                                            Luoric´s lore:

       In the old days, when he was still called Louric, the young demacian passionate about combat used to train with the demacian military elite, especially with his great friend, Garen, and his cousin, Taric. The three of them were always together until the moment that Taric was condemned for his inactivity in leading the Demacian army by Garen. Lou, unlike his family, did not turn his back on Ta, even after the announcement of cousin´s exile from the strict Demacia.
    
       Louric soon turned against Garen, who had taken the person Louric most identified with in all Valoran, from his reach. In one of their discussions, Garen took Louric's fighting sword as punishment for questioning the royal guardian. Aiming to strike Garen, Louric went to his sister, the heir to the Crownguard family, to conspire a consequence against him, however, wanting to protect herself from conflicts, Lux denied Louric support. Very angry and eager to fight again, Louric went to Lux's rival, Fiora, who became Lou's great companion.
    
       One day, Fiora ordered a longsword from the only one fit to forge the species around, Poppy. Since then, Fiora had been sharing her dueling knowledges to her companion, she fencing her Florete with one hand and Louric using both hands in his longsword. Even with the good friendship built and having left the army, Louric still felt uncomfortable with the orders and restrictions of his friend Fiora, aspects that his cousin so repudiated, so he decided to leave the head of the house Laurant to go in search of his cousin and more answers about himself.
    
       Looking for Taric, Louric climbed to the highest point of Targon, the ancient temple Lunari, home of Diana, who welcomed him from the cold of the mountain top and sheltered him. Without imagining that his cousin now lived with the stars, Louric left night after night behind Taric, having as his only companion, Diana, who wished to introduce him to Lunari acquaintance.
    
       In one of his nightly searches, Lou came across a clearing in a forest filled with vampire bats, this clearing was illuminated by a thunderous star when Lou aligned himself with the starlight, all the other targon stars blurred for an instant, causing the bats to attack him frantically until the targon stars regained their brilliance. While his blood was sucked in, Lou's mind visualized a colossal interstellar dragon: A unique curse left by Aurelion Sol, as revenge for the times of forced servitude to the Targonians.
       
       Arriving almost faint in the temple, Diana rescued him and found it fitting to strengthen him with a Lunari ritual. In order to be realized, the being had to go armed to the dark region of the temple, and return to the reflective zone of the lunar light, to be renewed by the Aspect. Being raised by Diana, Louric then walked in the shadows, and as he entered them he darkened all the glow of the Moonlight, having no way of returning to the light, Louric was consumed by the darkness. Diana, in an attempt to regain the essence of her temple, invoked the Moonlight again, causing great torment to Louric's new dark properties that resulted in an unpretentious and extremely powerful fusion, which defaced the essence and form of that young Demacian.
    
       When Diana called him to the light, the image of the young demacian no more existed, now the light could no longer fully reveal him, to the point of failing his own reflection, bringing aspects of ""bugs"" of magical essence, a creature never seen before was born of failure and accident, indecipherable even to the most harmless light of all, a winged being, in a costume of shadows, wild ears and dark garments, a hybrid weapon between an upright sword and a magically corrupted staff of black glow, extremely robust, with wavy and semi-long hair, and who gets teleported randomly through the darkness. Luoric, the moon´s bug, was born, the being cursed by the sun. who came from the dark side of the moon.

#                                            Luoric´s Skills:

**Passive** \-} **Tilt**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/g269d5112mp41.jpg?width=151&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b0363f1102d7c5413b4d4423da2104334faaec3)

&gt;Each 3 s out of combat, Luo's image fails on the map, causing him to suddenly teleport at a short distance to a point selected by the summoner in the enabled range. The third attack of Luoric always shoots a magic gust that causes magic damage, in addition, cuts 60% of the target's acquired cure in 4 s.

&amp;#x200B;

  

**Q** \-} **Lunar Cut**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/o6xg781j2mp41.jpg?width=169&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=429f8d0a45174cf816206024f0625c7526aceb7f)

&gt;Luoric cuts the zone in front of him, making a half moon with his longsword, which damages the area and causes a a move speed reduction, for 3 s, to enemy champions hit.

&amp;#x200B;

  

**W** \-} **Corrupted staff**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/9syja8ks2mp41.jpg?width=170&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd0014c6094a40bc7d7d8fb0ddce9681e71afbac)

&gt;Luoric triggers his corrupt staff and conjures up magic that can be shot at both allies and enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Allies\] - \[Luoric cures the selected ally and provides increased move speed for 4 s \]  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Enemies\] - \[by hitting the magic on the enemy, Luoric causes magical damage and decreases the target´s critical strike chance for 6 s\] 

&amp;#x200B;

  

**E** \-} **ErRor**

https://preview.redd.it/s0d0vik73mp41.jpg?width=167&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b66daecdfbf98580b4d8b46bb745f659a471d332

  

***This skill can only be used in combat***

&gt;\[Active\] - Luo tilts and teleports by conjuring up the skill.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Passive\] - If he is attacking and receiving more total damage than the attacked by him, Luoric tilts automatically and teleports to the target´s back, as soon as the automatic teleport is performed, a projection of Luo is formed in the place before the teleport for 5.5s, which zeroes the ErRor´s cooldown.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Active\] - Conjuring ErRor after zeroing the cooldown of the skill causes Luo to return to his position before the automatic teleport. 

&amp;#x200B;

**R** \-} **Gloomy** 

  

&gt;Luo with his corrupted staff, when he targets an enemy, invokes magic that stuns a opponent for 4 s and explodes it , causing additional magical damage. Luoric can also conjure Gloomy in himself or in allies, in which case the target becomes invulnerable for 4 s and, during that time, recovers part of the life.  
&gt;  
&gt;If with Gloomy , Luo gets a kill, the cooldown of the skill is reset to a next conjuration until 7s, in case Luoric does not get a second conjuration in this 7s, the cooldown returns to reload.",2,1585487834,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr5r0q/the_best_champion_concept_of_south_america/,leagueoflegends,1

fr5o3b,JoshTGRU,Urf/One for All NOT FUN: Crowd Control Problems,"These gamemodes are extremely unfun to play. If it isn't the annoying competitive players or the bad picks by your team, its the gamemode's balance, which is abysmal. I thought One ForAall would've differed greatly from Urf, in hindsight it did, but retains Urf's major problem. In Urf and One for All, the problem is mainly the over-dominance of Crowd Control abilities which render the gamemodes almost unplayable. In Urf, go against a Nautilus, sure you can try and dodge all his Crowd Control, but for how long, assuming you can without making a mistake. Once he hits you, you're Crowd Control locked and unable to do anything. You're at the player's mercy. The same case applies to One For All in which the multiple characters, 2 or 3 can single you out and Crowd Control lock you.

&amp;#x200B;

Too fix this issue, I highly recommend the following:

\-For Urf, All Crowd Control abilities should be returned to their default game timers. This would server to allow counterplay and not just pray your not cc-locked.

\-For One For All, I recommend Crowd Control Immunity. Once a CC ability has been applied to you, you cannot be hit with any other Crowd Control for 5 seconds.",41,1585487431,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr5o3b/urfone_for_all_not_fun_crowd_control_problems/,leagueoflegends,1

fr5e3a,BaronDraek,Will Riot adress the Ping problems on the European Servers? (And everywhere else?),"Ever since Europe has been on lockdown, and everyone has been staying inside, both the EUW and EUNE Regions have been experiencing horrific Ping problems. Sometimes the Servers are down, and won't let you play the Game. Sometimes ranked is down. Everything seems to be on fire. People with decent Ping are now experiencing up to 100+ ms, basically unplayable on some Champions.

Riot has told us nothing, it seems like they aren't even acknowledging the problems.

But wait, there's more! In the last Video uploaded to the League of Legends Youtube Channel Riot mentioned the money they donated to Organizations that work on the Covid-19 Outbreak across the world, that's awesome, but they also told us something else.

They said that they will be making Clash availble more often during the time people are spending inside, and guess ***when*** the ping is at it's worse? Yeah it's when Clash is availble.

While most of the issues are affecting the EUW Servers, other Servers like EUNE or even NA are experiencing the same problems.

I understand that it's very hard for Riot to fix things, expecially right now giving the fact that they also have to work on League from home. But at least tell us that you ""will be looking into it"" or something. 

TL;DR: We want a response from Riot regarding the ping problems across multiple Regions.",3,1585486072,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr5e3a/will_riot_adress_the_ping_problems_on_the/,leagueoflegends,1

fr59gi,ZarahXenon,What do you do in „bad games“ as Support?,"Hi everyone, 

I‘m a support main looking out for some advice. I came back after a break of 10 month and started ranked too early - it was a mistake. Now I‘m in Silver 1 and thought about what I can do better to help winning the game. It works way better till I limited my champion pool (Morgana / Leona / Nami or Janna) but there are some games where I feel useless or ignored by my team. I know that you can’t win every game and this is not about complaining „I only get bad teammates“. But there where 2 games that I regret loosing and I thought I will ask what you would have done in those situations. 

1. Game: I played Morgana together with an Ezrael against Swain + Jhin. I found out (maybe should have dodged) that my adc never plays Ezrael and it seemed like he just picked it because it’s a „counter“ against Swain. Jhin + Swain are pretty good early so I just wanted to help Ezrael with the minions a bit that they won’t get a lvl 2 advantage and tried to poke a bit. But my Ezrael immediately pinged me and wrote in chat „I can‘t farm if you hit minions“. So I stopped for the sake of his farm. It ended up that we where getting pushed under tower even there I wasn’t allowed to hit any minion (prepare cs) or he instantly pinged me and he lost nearly every cs (he had 50cs when Jhin had 90cs). Besides farming badly he also had an awful positioning + wave management. My spellshield has pretty high cd early and he got caught pretty often (me too sometimes but at least I tried to dodge the Jhin w afterwards). He often hasn’t used his e or jumped straight back and getting hit by at least Jhin w this way. Sometimes he just started pushing even if it was obvious that they want us to push because of a gank (I pinged away nothing happens) and later we just got tower dived by enemy mid. If my adc is bad or just too far behind I try to roam and help the most valuable team mate to snowball. But it’s hard before turning lvl 6 (because of missing xp and supp item stacks). So what would you do on such a lane (till you hit lvl 6 and can start roaming a bit) without feeling useless? Remember we got harassed under tower all the time because he wanted to „play safe“.

2. Game: I played Morgana as well again with an Ezrael. He played very defensive and had 0 map awareness / ignoring my pings but at least did a better farming job and got some kills later. My team was doing fine, not good but fine. The problem was my team gave a) a fuck about objectives and b) always started 3vs5 fights. We somehow even won a few 4vs5 fights but I started to tell them to stop it anyway but they didn’t want to listen. I always pinged drake 1 minute / 30 sec before and builded up vision. Then going back sweaper over there and have more wards to place if the enemies sweaper too. But my team just ignores it. They getting caught 10 sec before drake spawns or just letting it uncontested. The enemies where stacking drakes till drake soul and everyone ignored it?!?! Even if we won a team fight and it was a free baron or drake for us everyone ported back and goes back farming letting the enemies respawn and then letting it go uncontested again. We then lost pretty closely because my team started again a 3vs5 and we were not able to defend against all the buffs the enemies had. This happens so often, Silver and even Gold people just ignoring objectives and never listen to pings / watching the mini map. They starting fight 3vs5 not because they think they can win it they just don’t recognize that they are only 3 ... anything to do against that?

But as fast as it is done loading it reloads to a site that logs me out automatically causing me needing to log back in again and it just repeats all over again.  


Basically becomes a catch 22 with all of it.  
Any idea as of why this might be happening?

I help run a group for League of Legends players that play on the Korean server!

We’d love to reach out to more gamers in Korea that play here and are looking for a community, or maybe even some competition! 

We also run tournaments, IRL events, and in-house games with our members, which are extremely entertaining, especially when our streamers and casters get involved!

fr44e6,Aelicto,Gamebreaking Warwick bug,"Reposting this because yesterday match history was down and i couldn't get footage of the bug.
I was playing against a ww top in ranked which would constantly and willingly abuse this bug in which: He holds Q on a minion to lasthit, he gets the gold, he gets the healing from q AND the Q cost gets refunded which is a mechanic WW is not intended to have. Which i would say its pretty gamebreaking since ww has low mana and can't actually spam his abilities without going oom.
You can replicate this bug 100% of the times but you need to hold your q, pressing it once won't do and you have to lasthit the minion with it. Try it out on practice tool if you want, its really easy.

Then I got my first penta, and the 3 premade guys in my team started trolling so they can throw and ruin the game for me, and I asked enemy team and our Ashe to report them. Then I got another penta and enemy team sided with my troll teammates because they were furious for not being able to do anything with me, and everyone started saying “Report Yi”. Even with 3 trolls I was able to close the game with Ashe, we won it, not that it matters because its a blind pick, but when I left the game my honor was locked and chat restricted for 15 games. 

3 months later I moved to checkpoint 2 of honor 0, and checkpoint 3 of honor 1 seems so far away and I don’t think that I will be getting end of season rewards. Honor lock should be reserved for people who get 1-2+ weeks of game ban, and not slap on the wrist that is 15 games chat restriction, that anyone can get even if they typed almost nothing on the chat, but “report” seems to be the trigger word that you can get banned for for using. 

3 months playing with ally and all chat muted, lesson learned, I am only using pings from now on.",7,1585479165,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr44bs/honor_0_and_end_of_season_rewards/,leagueoflegends,1

fr3z7n,Milk_Is_Special,Champions that get changed so much that they lose their original role,"The best example I can give is Swain.

I like Swain, as a champion and as a character, but he's currently so weak that you just can't play him in any other role than support (And maybe adc, with a hard cc support). How has a champion that was designed to be a midlaner, get fucked over so much by riot, that the only way you can play him is by having another champion permanently by your side to either save your ass or deal all the damage. Just revert him back to just after his rework, when getting stacks was actually useful for dealing damage with his ult, and when his Q was actually usable in lane, without running out of mana after 4 Qs. He's a mess of a champion right now, because riot likes pushing midlaners they don't like into the support role.

And that isn't the only case of this happening. Fiddlesticks (I know he's getting reworked) is basically a support now, with barely any play in the jungle. Mundo is more of a jungler than a toplaner nowadays. Kayle isn't even considered a midlaner anymore. Morgana, Zyra and Karma were originally midlaners.

When it comes to nerfs, shortly, what they say is that a champion will be nerfed if they achieve any of the following:

1.  52.5% WR and 5x average BR at any elo
2.  54.5% WR regardless of their BR at everything below Platinum
3.  54% WR regardless of their BR at the interval from Platinum to Diamond 3
4.  50% BR at Diamond 2 and above
5.  54% WR regardless of their BR at Diamond 2 and above

Right now, here is the list of champions listed as S+ at Platinum+ in [u.gg](https://u.gg):

**Mid Lane:**

* Kassadin
* Katarina
* Talon
* Diana
* Vladimir
* Fizz
* Zed

**Jungle:**

* Elise
* Wukong
* Ekko
* Master Yi
* Shaco
* Zac

**Bot lane:**

* MF
* Vayne
* Cait
* Senna
* Draven

**Support:**

* Leona
* Blitz
* Nami
* Bard

**Top:**

* Wukong
* Darius
* Garen
* Fiora

You could say S+ is [u.gg](https://u.gg)'s way of saying a champion is too strong. However, most os these champions would not be flagged by Riot's criteria. So, I ask you as a player: Do you think the game would be more or less balanced if all of these were nerferd? 

My point is that even though some of these may not be strong enough to deserve nerfs, most of them could use some, but Riot's criteria, as opposed to these kind of sites, will almost always guarantee that the number of champions flagged as OP is very small. 

As a consequence, champions that are obviously noted as broken by the playerbase will go untouched for many patches because they did not reach a bar that is flying high on the sky. 

\* Note: I do not mean to say [u.gg](https://u.gg) should be the holy grail of balance but that all of these sites end up flagging more champions as OP than Riot's new criteria, and that, coupled with the fact that the last patch notes contained only 6 nerfs, indicates that this criteria should be widened.",36,1585476671,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr3oz9/riot_would_do_itself_a_favor_if_it_started/,leagueoflegends,1

Some of you may feel more comfortable befriending boys to play, talk to, chill online in quarantine with, hence why we came up with that server. We’re 87 members, boys only, we go through a verification to make sure you’re a boy, hop in vocal chat, you don’t have to tell us about your life and childhood, just a hello would suffice.

For the girls out there, it’s not about being masculinist, some of us just really appreciate to have a place where they can chill with boys only when they want to, we know you’re not all assholes but we appreciate to have a choice in the matter with whom we play sometimes.

Especially in situations when I'm boxing and I want to use the yellow card, but I started off with the blue, purely out of RNG, and it's a half second too late, I die before I reach my desired choice.

Basically, I think it would just be a QoL change if there was a way to not depend on RNG, making it more reliable. Something like always starting with the same card (probably the blue since it's the most left). Or, something more intricate, like after pressing the W, the Q W and E turn into different prompts that upon pressing them, you get the card of your choice.

fr2b3n,tempermentaltyrant-,how do i find my main as a mid-laner???,"guys,

i’ve been playing League for the good part of a year now, and cannot FOR THE LIFE OF ME find my main. 

i play lots of champs. i haven’t mastered one. i’ll go from Vlad, to Ekko, to Cassiopeia. then when i have bad games as one of those, i’ll play simpler champs and win and tell myself i should stick to easy champs, so i play Diana, Garen etc. then i have bad games as those, so i go back to the strong “mechanical champs” and i’m always blaming it on the champion i play and never my own discipline. 

i’m Silver 4. i really don’t want the Annie recommendations, because while i want to climb, i want to master a champ that isn’t boring, and that isn’t a Tier 4 champ. ultimately, i want to know how the heckitty heck you guys found your main. i have fun with lots of champs, but when i have bad games, i automatically turn away for one of several reasons. 

because i’m so low elo, i am tempted to pick up and practice Fizz as I’ve heard lots of success stories of climbing with him. but how can I discipline myself to stick to one champ or two even? what happens if they get banned?

i’m in shambles. all i want is to have one or 2 champions to call “mine”, so i can finally feel like my knowledge of the game is being implemented into my actual game. please help.",27,1585468418,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr2b3n/how_do_i_find_my_main_as_a_midlaner/,leagueoflegends,1

I don't necessarily agree, because Trundle ult doesn't last nearly as long as he was in the dragon pit but Meteos is a pro, so I think we should give his thoughts some consideration. I do agree that reddit did overreact to this play, because he would likely just get syndra e'd and one shot if he went in and that's why he probably didn't go in. Regardless, it's still questionable but I was wondering what you guys thought of the situation. Also, he did manage to zone flyquests backline for a while.

https://twitter.com/MalaclypseDC/status/1244052330405756928

I think this is a reasonable take, with him being kind of behind and   it's a good point that his pick was bad in the first place and can't really do much in the situation.

fr1hw9,sikox,LCS has never been worse,"I just needed to get a few thoughts off my chest here. Oh are you wondering what my qualifications are? I have none. I don't care. You can check my comment/post history. I literally only talk about LoL on reddit. I'm a casual player and I've been watching and absorbing pro-league since season 4. I just feel like there are a few things I want to say as it regards to pro league in NA as of late. 

This is the worst split of LCS to date. I don't care what anyone says, this is the lowest low LCS has hit. I've watched every season since like season 4. With the amount of available information, even to the casual fan such as myself, we still see Renekton being prioritized in like 3 games today and getting shit on in all 3. Its a microcosm of the split as a whole. It's amazing how watching LS's or even Dom's co-streams could lead teams to achieve better results than the strategies and drafts that are currently employed. C9 is the only half decent team. In a league with actual competition (either Esports or traditional), the league standings would not shape out this way (with 1 good team and 2-9 in playoff contention). Take TSM for example. Probably the second best team in the league currently\*? (\*who the fuck knows). They lost today to 100T solely because their draft was so inferior. The games may be close, and the standings closer, but the quality overall compared to other regions is just so low I don't even know what to say. Only C9 would even compete in EU. 

I don't know how the people in charge (coaches/analysts) of NA teams strategy came to power, but its clear something needs to change. Most drafts are terrible. Most strategy in game by teams is terrible. I think LCS suffers from the same plague most new sports leagues and other industries suffer from. Teams re-hire those who have been here from the start, as it looks like the have 'experience', but don't really understand the game. 

Look, I don't know for sure, I'm just some idiot on reddit after all. But the gameplay we have seen this split is atrocious and almost insulting to my intellect.",3,1585464034,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr1hw9/lcs_has_never_been_worse/,leagueoflegends,1

For something that does a lot of poke damage that can chunk out a marksmen and other squishy champs for like 1/5 their health per shot I would think knowing where the e is going to land should be the most important thing to someone having to dodge it. Especially when lux gets her first item and than can start chunking you to half your health if you don't have magic resist at that point. Even if it did nothing in terms of damage and was just a slow its still unfair since I have no way of actually knowing if I am safe.

fr0r9p,TalonVirginSlayer,The Guide Voice Line Break down on,"So as we all know there's a leaked or rather voice line leaked for a new champion recently called ""Freljord: The Guide"" anyway this is from what i can get from breaking down on his quotes since we pretty much will know who the guide is... so let's read all of his quotes that has been leaked first:  


surrounded by warriors, you either go to war or perish,still there is another way,   
With no tribe your only goal is survival , with no alliances you are behold to no one,  
Through the storms and they cross the battlefield we march,  
The spoils of the war belong to the conquerors but the remnants of the war belongs to the scavengers ,  
From go frost to the frost guard citadel we roam... solitary but united,  
The day civil war of three sisters remain in know ice born memory,  
but we were there... not me... bu we were there.  


Now there's a few hint or point in here that told us who is The guide  
first lets take a look what we can find here:  
\-""Surrounded by warriors, you either go to war or perish, still there is another way""  
in this line we know that the guide is talking about his own experience and about a way to survive in Freljord.  


\-""With no tribe your only goal is survival, with no alliances you are behold to no one""  
Now this is where things got a little spicy hold your horses... yes i know some of you may think this is Volibear rework isn't it?! but... sadly no and why i say that? well first Voli have a tribe and he have an alliance if you don't know what i'm talking about please read the story about ornn and voli so if this is not Voli is The guide a totally new champ!? YES  


\-""Through the storms and they cross the battlefield ""we"" march""  
You see how he use ""we"" even tho first he say ""they?"" well with ""They"" the guide actually refers to the soldier of the tribe that go to wars  


\-""The Spoils of the war belong to the conquerors but the remnants of the war belong the scavengers""  
This... This is a massive information on who actually the guide is... remember when i talked about when The guide talk about they he refers to the soldier? now u might be wondering if They is the soldier then who is ""we"" that he refers to? well it's actually the Scavengers that always march to the wars that already ended to scavenging the remnants of it.  


\-""From go frost to frost guard citadel we roam, solitary but united""  
This he refers on how the scavengers like to roam from a war to another even tho they roam in solitary and not in group but they all united.  


\-""The day civil war of three sisters remain in know ice born memory,  
but we were there... not me... bu we were there""  
Well this also him talk about how the scavengers have been there long ago even when the three sisters fought in war but remember the guide did not talk about himself but he refer to his fellow scavengers that was before him.  


Anyway  please forgive my terrible English since it is not my main language that i spoke of so the reason why i open this thread is because i want all of you to share your own theory and your own interpretation for all of his quotes so please feel free to share!!",4,1585460375,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr0r9p/the_guide_voice_line_break_down_on/,leagueoflegends,1

fr0m0x,omgimabagel,There is a lot of healthy champions in this game that is super fun to face.,"Just wanted to applaud Riot for what they've done with the game, after all these years its hard to keep your game in great shape like they have.  Facing something like Dr. Mundo and watching him become unkillable no matter how far behind he gets is truly one of the better things that 200+ years of game development has to offer.  A Vladimir which is a ticking time bomb that can flash into your team on a 1v5 situation, throw his ult while pressing W and E to combo your team and oneshot everyone almost, including your tanks, well that's just something you love to see and i'm glad theres potential for someone as good as Vladimir players to get recognition. 

Finally, I love seeing a common house cat stop me from killing any person on the team by full healing them in an instant after rushing all the dick sucking items in the world and running two offensive summoners because she doesn't die if she sits on another tank with a very healthy design, or a carry, take your pick thats the fun!

In conclusion, why hasn't Jarvan been nerfed?  Pretty sure if you take some AD from his Q he'll be a healthy champ again.. I was thinking a number like I don't know.. 5?  Thank you Riot for taking this game into a terribly fun game and making it designed in a healthy fashion.  :) Keep up the great work for years to come!",1,1585459686,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fr0m0x/there_is_a_lot_of_healthy_champions_in_this_game/,leagueoflegends,1

Today, I queued up with the most disgusting players I've ever met. 

I was in a party with my adc and we queued up with a party of 3 in draft. The other team proceeded to ban 1 or 2 of the champions they wanted to play. They then started telling my duo and I to dodge. Of course we didn't want to. Blah blah, you know how it goes, they say theyre going to throw the game and take our bot lane. I ended up going with zoe and decided for mid. 

In game they told the other team that we were cursing at them and calling them racial slurs I would never say. They ended up going 3 mid and my duo and I were stuck going top and bot respectively. The part that really disgusted me was when one joked in all chat about pedophilia and rape, and his other party members seemed like they enjoyed it too. This went on for a few minutes but at that point I was already sick to my stomach.

fqzpmw,TreeKeeper15,Recent Jungle Pool Additions Add New Fantasies To League,"So since Riot has been buffing random champions to try to make them viable in the jungle, I have been trying to play most of them to see how they feel and if I think they might be worth adding to my jungle pool. I think some of them have missed the mark for various reasons, whether it's a weak clear or poor ganking (or both, looking at you Gnar), but others are really fun or even feel viable. I know that I am probably not the best judge of what is actually good or not, as a Gold player who doesn't even jungle as his main role (although it's my secondary and I play it a lot). One thing that really stuck out to me, as someone who really enjoys fulfilling specific fantasies in League, is that the addition of Zyra and Yorick to the viable jungle pool adds a fantasy that League has really been missing: A summoner jungler who's minions tank the camps for them. While it wasn't a fantasy that I realized I wanted before I experienced it, it's definitely a fun one for me and it feels really good. Yorick feels more like a roving posse, with the ghouls walking from camp to camp with you and a sense of companionship forming (even if you keep summoning new ones), while Zyra feels like a traditional summoner who would rather not get their hands dirty, relying on your temporary plants to take hits and dish them out. In general I've been a really big fan of a lot of the more recent jungle additions, with Brand also feeling really fun chaining flame rings and razing everything to the ground, while maxing pool on Morg gives you almost no cooldown on it while healing and shredding the camps. I just wanted to praise Riot for their attempts at adding new junglers that fulfill new fantasies for the players.",6,1585455597,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqzpmw/recent_jungle_pool_additions_add_new_fantasies_to/,leagueoflegends,1

fqzkyz,HumblPenguin,The latest TL VS FLY game is a perfect capsule of the overall lack understanding of Taric between pro's and casters.,"I have been a Taric main for 3 seasons now and after S6 i saw taric fall off of the map of competitve play and now that he has become a more consistent pick, mostly in LCK but seeing games played across all 4 major regions. With my understanding of the game i am seeing something being off about how casters talk about taric and how the players are building him which has been frustrating me the entire split. I am not trying to say that there are objectively ways to build or play him but there are massive misconceptions about how he is best used that I wanted to just type all this out if for no other reason to get my opinions off my chest.

This split the 4 major regions has seen taric be picked 44 times so far. I have watched most of them and there are many trends that are baffling to me including. The over priority of shurelya's as an item purchase, the perception of casters across regions but specifically in NA and LCK of taric being an engage support, and players taking aftershock and forgoing building any resistances.

Shurelya's Reverie is not an item that makes sense to build on taric for many reasons both in context of the game states and team comps but also out of said context.

1. It does not help taric with what he is most effectively at doing which is to protect a back line from dive or to disrupt team fights.
2. It is not helpful for fixing what is stopping taric from being an engage champion
3. If you watch every game where the item is built you will see the item creating a play that wasn't already going to happen less then 5 times accross LCS, LEC, LPL, and LCK even though it is bought in 42% of games.
4. A majority of team comps have either 1 or no front line champions when taric is picked making an item that only gives 300 hp not good enough if the team wants taric to live in fights.
5. Redemption costing only 50 more gold creates more opportunities for plays and healing which taric is meant to do.
6. The majority of games where taric is picked is along side kalista who in theory enjoys the bonus ms that Shurelya's gives however taking zekes actually increases the damage of the champion and allows taric to tank skill shots and get up close and personal with the enemy team like how both his kit and kalista needs to function

Taric is not an engage champion no matter who says it. This is a simple fact due to how taric interacts to a competitive environment. The main problem with this idea is that taric's only way to conduct himself as an engage champion is to press e and walk towards the enemy. This would be like saying braum is an engage support because he can press q and stun someone. It is an fundamental misunderstanding of what the champion's abilities actually do. 

One thing to take into consideration is that taric's ult takes 2.5 seconds to activate to make him and nearby allies invulnerable for 2.5 seconds. The wait before being invulnerable is not fast enough to get himself out of being targeted by any amount of focusing by the enemy team before his health bar is too low for him to be able to continue the fight. As well as the invulnerability not being long enough to change how most carries interact with the beginning of team fights. However both timings are perfect to disincentivise the enemy team to follow up on their team's engage/dive. This is proven by watching what happens when a taric player is caught out of position and panic presses r because every time they die before it goes off but in any reasonable team fight taric can easily make an engage not work for the enemies by pressing one button. 

 Aftershock is a borderline useless rune for taric for the same reasons that he is not an engage champion and how he is ment to be played in team fights and lane phase. However even if you are in the 1/100 games where it is the correct rune to take you have to actually build resistances to make it an effective rune. If you watch the 20% of recent taric pro games however you would see players taking the rune, building armor boots and hoping it is enough to make the rune actually useful when they go for either a redemtion or shurelya's for their first item and not being able to land their e's to make them live in fights. 

Aftershock was commonly taken on champions like lux support or lissandra mid in the past. Riot was not a fan of how tanky it made these champions so in patch 9.23 they shifted it's power to have it be effective when you already bonus armor/mr instead of having more front loaded resistances inherent in the rune. Now i will say that i don't entirely disagree when players are taking the rune but instead of how they are itemizing when they take it. This is mostly the fact due to teams commonly not taking any front liners and/or engage with the taric and you will need the extra tankiness if you are the only thing standing between both teams.

In the TL Vs Flyquest game on 3/28 Phreak and Azael where discussing the choice of support item that corejj took on taric as he went shoulder guards instead of relic shield and both casters were not a fan of the pick up due to their preference to relic sheild for the increased healing and e damage. These are  correct and significant reasons for them. However they forget to look at the fact that they are looking at this game where TL took Kalista Taric and are facing Xayah Rakan that 100% out scales them but also that TL's entire team is on that same page so the AD from shoulder guards will be much more valuable in the game over all because if TL falls behind early, an extra 14 hp on a 2 stacked q in mid game won't matter because they are facing an uphill battle with how the comps interact overall. 

At 17:47 into this game Phreak mentions that ""taric doesn't get into melee range of the enemy team very easily but the kalista ult handles that as well"". You know i really want to make sure when i say taric is not an engage champion before anyone tries to argue my point, i want them to look at this very true statement and tell me what engage supports are like this. The answer is that there are none. Taric is being misused and the casters have to justify taric being an engage for TL because of both of the bot laner's ults that can make it work. If you replace the word taric with bruam in any of these casts you would be just as confused as me.",37,1585455048,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqzkyz/the_latest_tl_vs_fly_game_is_a_perfect_capsule_of/,leagueoflegends,1

fqziib,baylithe,Riot really needs to fix where they put new players in ranked.,"Had a Tristana top that was clearly brand fucking new, but we thought it was just gonna be another toxic smurf since they were level 30. This was in a high silver low gold game. She said it was her second game of ranked after dying for the 7th consecutive time. She went 0/15 by the end of it. How is that fair to us or to her? She had 78 CS in a 32 minute game. Most of which came from her killing the jungle monsters once she got angry at the jungler for raging at her for being so bad.  
So can we either stop with having high silver / low gold MMR for new accounts, or can we take into account their normal games before ranked to get an idea? I looked her up and she has several 0/11 and 1/19 games. Can't this be an obvious indicator that they are Iron and should be placed in iron games?

fqz2a1,nikostidis,"Who's gonna protect us from our protectors? (A European's manifesto regarding League and it's European servers, or maybe not just that)","It is really mind-boggling, at least for me, that the biggest PC game in the world is literally unplayable for millions of Europeans.

First of all, let's get things straight. League has the biggest playerbase of all games of all platforms, worldwide. It has, as a single game, the biggest revenue of any other game of any other platform, worldwide. It has arguably the biggest competitive scene of all games, of any platform.

Yet, for the past few years, it has been through a massive clusterfuck. I'll speak for my own personal experience and encourage you to keep speaking up about yours until someone listens and does something.

It's unfathomable that the actual biggest game in the world has a client that is half working. Constant errors everywhere. Match history not working in what feels like half the time for the past years. Play button bugging and not working. Queue stucking and never finding a game unless you re-open the entire client. Loot tab bugging out constantly. Notifications not going away. Bug splats. More bug splats. Entire sections with features utterly useless that are half-working but still overloading the client and preventing basic features from working properly, Clubs and Stats being prime examples. Pick&amp;Ban lock button bugging which results to people losing hard-earned progress with absolutely no compensation whatsoever. Runes bugging and not changing/saving with similar results, or even worse, since many of us prefer to just lose 20 LP than suffer for half an hour playing lethal tempo yuumi and lose 20 LP. And there are a dozen more problems that I can't name off the top of my head but would gladly edit my post to add them in an effort to make a comprehensive list.

And after all this disgustingly unprofessional treatment that the players of the **biggest game in the world** are receiving **for years** from the company that provides the game, we reach this situation going on the last month. The last month can be easily summarized with one sentence. **The game is literally unplayable for a huge amount of people**. Two of the biggest servers globally (EUW &amp; EUNE) are unplayable most of the time for the last month, coincidentally from the moment Clash was impelemented on those two servers. A huge amount of people are experiencing high pings and by high I mean unplayably high for a competitive online game from exactly the moment Clash was released. People are being disconnected from games out of the blue, losing LP, demoting, losing promos (this disgusting system designed to gatekeep you down and have you grind more games while offering no benefits at all other than some small dopamine hits). People are put in this pathetic dilemma: ""Either I sit here and suffer a headache and an overflow of anger while trying to play with \~150ms even though I know I most likely will lose, or Alt+F4 and risk getting punished for AFK behavior"". None of the options seem appealing at all, yet we're forced to choose. And all of this because some powerful men (I doubt there's any women executives in this terrible to work for environment) sat around a table and came up with Clash as their next means of expanding the communal (cult-like I would say) aspects of their game, while at the same time removing the ONLY place that felt like a community and not a cult, the boards.

I see a lot of people ranting about Eternals, new skins, new features, new games being developed and for various other reasons while the European servers are unplayable most of the time and I find it absolutely normal. However, many of you folks jump on the defend mommy-Riot train, disregarding those complaints on the basis that ""What do the artists have to do with server problems?"". Well, they have nothing to do with it and nobody blamed the artists. OUR PROBLEM IS THAT THE COMPANY WHO RUNS THE GAME KEEPS INVESTING IN WAYS TO CREATE FAKE NEEDS (Mostly to underage children) SO THAT WE TAKE OUR MONEY AND MOVE IT FROM OUR POCKETS TO THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS, WHILE THE GAME ITSELF IS UNPLAYABLE FOR A HUGE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. That's the problem. Not the skins division. Not the artists drawing stuff on a paper. Nor the masterminds who coded eternals. THE PROBLEM IS THE MANAGEMENT NOT THE WORKERS THEMSELVES. If your government keeps investing millions of the tax payers' money to fill every city square with statues and monuments while half the population is starving, then you have a problem. You have a problem, not with the sculptors and the architects, but with the very government itself.

It's sad how what used to be Riot's moral compass is now spinning and tumbling vigorously, unable to find a proper destination to show the way for. Their Social Justice Warrior stance against verbal toxicity, which was the very basis of their wannabe moral code, was shattered in light of the revelations of in-house toxicity, verbal abuse, physical abuse and power abuse. How can one who abuses their co-workers and employees come and lecture you about what you say in a **mutable** chat of an online game while at the same time they do nothing against other means of toxicity/griefing? How can one advocate for values like fairness, kindness, respect (seen the new loading screen tips?) when they show the utmost disrespect towards their customers and especially the most vulnerable ones, the underage, the children, by creating a demand for overpriced worthless goods that should not even be monetized and that are **not** even monetized by any other major gaming company?

Now, to answer some of the many comments that will come flying.

\-""It's the global lockdown that's causing it""

\-No it's not. All of the shit I described, the same shit that millions are going through, existed before COVID locked us up at our little safe spaces.

\-""I'm fine I never had any issues, maybe it's something else like your ISP""

\-**NO**, honey, it's not our ISPs as Riot Support tweeted recently in a blatant attempt to lie and not be transparent once again. First, we never claimed the problem affects everyone. We said it affects many. So you're one of the lucky ones if it doesn't affect you. Second, it's not an ISP issue because EVERYONE going through this mess is also reporting ZERO problems with other games, ZERO problems in connectivity overall. Third, if it was an ISP-specific issue, we would NOT see people playing from literally the same city, same area, same ISP but one lagging as hell while the other doesn't. It's a server problem and that's blatantly obvious. The fact that it hasn't affected you yet, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

\-""How do you know it's Clash? Everything seems to be working fine for me, plus the reported problems occur even when no Clash games are happening""

\-We do not know for a fact that it's Clash, but the evidence indicate towards that direction. The problems started literally the same days Clash was implemented on both those two servers. Also Clash has a really bad reputation of breaking the game, as we all know. It doesn't matter if Clash games are running or not. Just the existence of it in the client seems to break the game, once again, as it did during the previous attempts to implement it.

In dark times like the ones we're living in with the COVID situation, it is crucial that we stop being complacent with the decisions of others that affect us also. You'll frequently hear ""It's their game, they do what they want, if you don't want to play it then don't, you can't change it"" or ""The powerful institutions and governments will decide the social measures taken against COVID's economic crisis, you can't change those decisions"". No. You are the game. Literally. Without the players there is no game the same way without people there is no society. If by any means, you empathize with the topics raised in this thread, just stop supporting them until change comes. Stop pretending that their petty allowances are the solution. Be it RP or petty gifts of any kind. Just stop. That's what they want. They want you and me to feel helpless but thankfull for their ""generous"" allowances. They want you and me focusing on whether they'll throw some bone at us to keep playing with. Maybe some RP for an on-sale skin? Maybe a new Stat-tracker called Eternal? Maybe a random skin shard? Just stop. Stop being okay with this fake-parental culture from a multibillion company that only wants your money regardless of whether their product actually deserves your money. Stop being complacent with allowances given to cover up a huge mess instead of fixing the mess itself. You have the power, not them. Stop looking at them like some kind of parental protective figure that wants the best for you and is doing everything to ensure it. They don't. Demand change of course, which requires change of the broken moral compass. And give them nothing, until change comes.

tl;dr: It's a messed up clusterfuck so stop supporting them until they fix it.

Dear admins, I know you're the ideal sheperds to herd the livestock in the direction that the pro-meat industry's broken compass is showing, but please for the love of god, if you have some dignity and value it a bit more than a monthly check, don't censor this sheep talking to your right now.

Champions who are super squishy like Fizz need Zhonya's. Imagine trying to play Fizz without Zhonya's? It'd be near impossible! Same with Katarina and Elise! These champions have pretty poor mobility and survivability, so they need the active from Zhonya's to survive.

I started playing the game late season 2 and have been on and off ever since. I have never before had a ban or restriction in any kind. In fact, I reached honor lvl 5 when the system was first released. I don't say this to brag or make my actions for my 14 day ban right, but I do point them out to Riot so that there may be a change in the they choose to punish players. I was playing a ranked game and a Nunu came to my lane and took farm. At first, I pinged him to leave and jungle to no avail. He then proceeded to give kills to the enemy mid laner, making me more and more angry. This went on while he told me I deserved to lose and should have it this way. I called him a ""f\*\*"" out of anger and I was greeted by 14 day ban the next morning. I did not report the person because league has a pretty toxic community but he reported me I guess. I know my actions were wrong but I plea that riot give me a chat ban for an action that was only chat related. I did not grief or intentionally feed. I said a bad word and was punished with the extent of the ban system. I don't know how the banning system works but I don't think the first offense for a language should be a 14 day ban but rather a chat restriction or 2 day ban. I would like to hear your thought on the matter if you agree or disagree with me.

fqxvag,tempermentaltyrant-,what should my ‘Secondary Role Champion Pool’ consist of?,"hello all,

i’m a Silver 2 mid-laner who picks top-lane as my secondary role. my current champion pool for ranked consists of : 1 champion I can play decently but still need a lot of practice on to master (Syndra). 1 champion who I can play really well but isn’t necessarily a ‘brain dead’ pick (Kassadin). and 1 ‘braindead’ champion who I play when I feel like an easy game (Diana). 

generally I try to do the same with my second role, as I currently have : Fiora, Mordekaiser and Garen; however, my only concern is that people say Fiora is a “hard champion to play”, therefore I’m unsure if it’s worth keeping her in my top-lane champion pool, if I’m rarely up there to practice her. I’m not sure if I should swap her out for Kled (a somewhat mechanical champ but not tough to play), or being my second role, do I just play a bunch of ‘easy to play champions’? 

while I do like Fiora a lot; if I’m not playing her role often, is it pointless having her in my champion pool? ultimately, I would like to know how you guys choose your champion pool for your secondary role. I know some people just “dodge” the queue when they get their second role, but because I have no problem playing top, my main goal is to form a consistent champion pool. 

thanks guys!",6,1585448066,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqxvag/what_should_my_secondary_role_champion_pool/,leagueoflegends,1

fqxges,foafyboi,Latency issues,"hello, 

I live in Austria. On EUW Servers, I have a stable ping of roundabout 50ms. On EUNE Servers its the same- and that's the problem.

I looked it up and the EUW servers IP is  104.160.141.3 and it's based in Amsterdam. The EUNE Server IP is  104.160.142.3 and it's based in Frankfurt, Germany which is closer to Austria than Amsterdam. 

BUT when I ping the servers, on EUW I get the 50ms response, and on EUNE I get a constant 25ms response.

So the issue: when I ping the EUNE servers, I get a good ping, but when I actually play on it, my ping goes back to 50.

This is because you don't learn how to play the game or improve if you don't take risks and leave your comfort zone, and i think this applies to most things in life. 

If you are looking to get better at the game, don't be afraid to feel uncomfortable in the game.

fqx186,TacotheMagicDragon,Lets talk about one of the most consistent issues present in the game: Poor Design Choices,"Edit: Currently editing formatting to actually work. Give me a second.

Edit 2: Fixed it as best as I can on my computer.

&amp;#x200B;

When designing a PvP game to be ideally balanced there is a principle of balance that must always be adheared to. This is universal across all PvP games, although the terms might differ.

&amp;#x200B;

What I am talking about is the **""Triangle of Balance""**

&amp;#x200B;

At each end of the triangle is a part of the champions identity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Damage:** Is how much damage the champion is capable of inflicting.

&amp;#x200B;

**Durability:** Is how much damage the champion is able to take, or prevent with heals/shields.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mobility:** Is how effective a champion can move around, such as dashes, blinks, teleports, movement speed boosts, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

When designing a champion, you can choose **TWO** of these. There are a lot of examples of balanced champions who utilize this triangle very well:

&amp;#x200B;

**Rammus:** Has low damage, but high mobility and durability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vayne:** Has high damage and mobility, but low durability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lulu:** Has high durability, and decent mobility, but low damage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Talon:** Has high damage and mobility, but low durability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nautilus:** Has high durability and mobility, but low damage.

&amp;#x200B;

# Also some champions only have a single point in the triangle:

&amp;#x200B;

**Vel'koz:** Has high damage, but aside from bulk gained from items, doesn't have mobility or durability.

&amp;#x200B;

**Veigar:** Has high damage, and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, some champions are still busted despite this. For example, Jinx. This is simply due to numbers, or other mechanics. Any champion that adheres to the triangle of balance will either be inherently balanced, or be easy to put them back into balance in the case that they become too strong or too weak.

&amp;#x200B;

# Now lets take a look at couple champions who do not adhere to these rules:

&amp;#x200B;

**Master Yi:** Has high damage and mobility, and also has strong durability in the form of Meditate. This puts Yi in a complicated spot that makes him a bit harder to balance than other champions. Due to this, Yi will either be incredibly strong, like he is now, or incredibly outclassed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Irelia:** Has high damage on Q procs, high mobility on Q procs, high durability on Q heal, and Blade Dance reduction. This is a good example of a champion who was designed very poorly, as balancing them will be incredibly difficult. This is because there are so many areas that are strong, that simply nerfing one will either do nothing, or render the champion unusable.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kled:** Has high damage on Q and W, high mobility on his E and R, and high durability on his passive. To add more insult to injury, his passive can cause him to restore large amounts of HP almost instantly, making him a nightmare to fight against or escape from.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lee Sin:** Has high damage on Q, E, and R, high mobility on his Q and W, and decent durability on his W. Fortunately Lee Sin is actually a minor offense due to his durability not being that bad. Though this usually changes over the course of the game, as he will gradually get bulkier as he grabs his popular items Black Cleaver and Steraks Gage. To fix Lee Sin to be more balanced, a simple numbers adjustment will suffice.

&amp;#x200B;

**and finally, we get to the crown jewel of poor design:**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Yasuo

&amp;#x200B;

Yasuo is the epitome of how you should not design a champion in League of Legends. Due to his ability to have damage that used to be able to rival an assassin, mobility that makes it very difficult to escape him, and durability that in some cases makes him dodge lethal damage many times over, he is without a doubt, the poorest designed champion in League's history. Because of all this, Yasuo will always be an unbalanced mess, either overpowered, or useless. Nothing about him can be redeemed, and the only way to fix this is to rework him so that he adheres to the triangle of balance.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Final conclusion and disclaimer:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

League of Legends is likely not to achieve a well rounded champion pool, and that is simply because of the nature of PvP games. You can't balance for everything. But there are ways to make it easier to manage. This is one of them. That is not to imply it will fix everything and make League of Legends truly balanced. More rules need to be put into place for it to become a well rounded game. But before all that can happen, Riot needs to take a step back and re-evaluate how they design champions, because what they are doing right now is not sustainable for the game, even if the past couple champions have been compliant with the triangle of balance: (Yuumi, Sett, Zoe, etc) This is a multifaceted problem, that requires multiple solutions.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, there are indeed champions that technically violate this rule, and are not broken. For example, Gnar and Renekton. That does not disprove this, as there will always be exceptions to the rules in some form or another. What should be striven for, is to make sure there are not *too many* exceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, if you think I'm crazy for thinking this, I welcome your criticism on what I might have missed or overlooked, provided you are able to see the line between criticism, and insults.",29,1585444885,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqx186/lets_talk_about_one_of_the_most_consistent_issues/,leagueoflegends,2

Is there a way to get it to show the champion name instead of the player name above everyone's head?",10,1585441045,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqvzdc/how_to_tell_champion_names/,leagueoflegends,2
fqvy2u,Akinero,A New Semi-Pro League of Legends League!! (LCL),"Hello, fellow Summoners. I have spent the past year working on creating a new semi-professional League of Legends league. The league will be run almost entirely through Discord, involve large prize pools, and deliver the full esports experience to spectators. I'm here for some honest feedback.

**Purpose**  
We created the LCL to give all aspiring LoL athletes a clear path from solo queue to the world stage. I designed the league with these goals in mind:

1. Allow any player in the region to compete (currently NA only).
2. Give players the chance to hone their skills and earn a living through playing in the league.
3. Allow an unlimited number of players to participate..

**How It Works**  
The LCL's regular season begins in January and consists of 7 trials, each lasting 4 months. Each trial can be thought of as a mini-championship. Players may compete in as many or as few trials as they want. The winning team from each trial will earn one of 8 spots in the championship at the end of the season. The 8th spot will be filled via ""wild card"" pick based on the next best performing team that season.

Every trial has 8 phases:

1. **Signup** \- *1 week* \- Any player can sign up. There is a $20 draft fee (entry fee). You may sign up as a player or a captain. Captains draft players to their team in phase 5. Your draft fee is fully refunded if you aren't drafted.
2. **Scouting** \- *1 week -* Captains get access to a Discord channel that lists every player that registered for the draft. Captains ""mark"" these players as scouted. A player may only be scouted 4 times. Captains may ONLY draft players that they scout.
3. **Tryouts** \- *2 weeks -* Captains are responsible for organizing their scouted players for tryouts. Captains may try out as many or as few of their scouted players as they like.
4. **Callbacks** \- *1 week -* Captains get 1 additional week to try out their scouted players and get an idea of their final team.
5. **Draft** \- *1 week -* Captains are ordered from lowest solo rank to highest solo rank. Then by worst league record to best league record. This determines the order in which captains draft players to their team. There will be 5 draft rounds (one for top, mid, etc.). Each captain may draft one player in each round.
6. **Training** \- *2 weeks -* Teams have 2 weeks to train together before qualifiers. Captains are solely responsible for organizing these training sessions.
7. **Qualifiers** \- *4 weeks -* Qualifiers will be Swiss format, Best 2 of 3. The number of rounds will be determined by how many teams there are (minimum of 4 rounds at 16 teams). The top 8 teams will advance to the Finals.
8. **Finals** \- *4 weeks -* Finals will be held on-site at the Magic City ePLEX in Birmingham, AL. Only 2 members of your team must be present at the location, the other 3 can be anywhere. Finals are double elimination, best of 3. The final round is best of 5. The top 3 teams will be awarded prize money.

I've done my best to describe how the league works without getting too granular. There are plenty of details that I'm leaving out of this post, but all details will be available in the Discord once it goes public.

**Details**  
Here's a list of some of the finer points of the leagues operation:

* This league is based in Birmingham, AL, which is where each trials finals will be held. For the championship at the end of the season, the LCL pay for all players flights &amp; lodging.
* Teams must have a minimum of **2** players that can physically attend the finals. The system guarantees that you do not violate this rule.
* The league is split into 3 distinct divisions: A, B &amp; C. All divisions play their regular season simultaneously, and teams only play against other teams within their own division. Division is based on rank.
* Matches are only held on weekends to maximize the number players that can participate.
* Pre-made teams are allowed. These will appear to captains as ""packages"". All players will be marked as scouted and drafted together.
* Captains that fail to organize training sessions or manage their team will be restricted from registering as a captain in future trials.
* Captains will be allowed to substitute team members if necessary, starting in phase 6.
* Tournament codes will be automatically sent to players before their matches. If a player is not present in the lobby during check-in then their team forfeits that match.",23,1585440916,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqvy2u/a_new_semipro_league_of_legends_league_lcl/,leagueoflegends,3

fqv4y6,andrewfender7,Recommended champs to improve with? (Not tier list/easiest to win with),"Hi guys. I recently started playing LoL again after several years and wanna improve my gameplay again. Last time I played was season 4. I used to main support and a little jungle. This time around I'd rather main mid (and off-role support), since mid is a much better role to play when you want to get better at the game compared to support.

Do you guys have any mid champs that you would recommend for learning the game with? I.e. champs with fairly simple mechanics who give me the opportunity to just learn about CSing, lane matchups, map awareness, itemising properly, et.  instead of focusing on complex combos &amp; mechanics. I'm mid silver atm, back in season 4 I was high plat. Annie is a good example of one of these champs, although she's so frustratingly bad in lane vs. almost every champ that gets played at my elo.

Here's my op.gg -  [https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Gekissin](https://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Gekissin) . I've stopped playing Kass &amp; Galio since they're clearly not working for me. I'll probably stop with Veigar too, although my low win-rate on him is legitimately due to a shocking number of intentional feeders over the last couple of days (just check my match history with him and look at the number of 1/10 or similar top laners I've had, it's unreal).

Anyway, thanks for any recommendations you guys might have :-) (any additional resources like videos and whatnot would be really nice too) thanks guys!",19,1585438001,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqv4y6/recommended_champs_to_improve_with_not_tier/,leagueoflegends,2

The bizCZAR community invites you all to join us for our Daily League of Legends scrimmages, hosted 8PM Central! (9EST-6PST).

Our current scrim pool rank average is high plat low diamond, though all ranks are welcome to come join and improve! \[We aim to increase the overall elo pool with some of these recruitment posts. : \^)\] The rules are simple!

Rules &amp; Requirements: Access to discord (microphones are preferred but not mandatory). Willingness to play and learn in group environments. Blatant toxicity is under no circumstance acceptable and WILL result in a permanent ban! The occasional banter is fine, but know when you're taking it too far : \^)

Note: Depending on availability, some matches the mmr will range while trying to uphold the best competitive integrity for higher elo players! Going forward, casual in-houses will be held separately from higher elo scrimmages to preserve competitive integrity.

fquvzr,f-r-m,Veteran player experience,"In my own opinnion the ranked system acces should be raised to lv 60 or 90 ,we played quit a long time to achieve the acces to ranked system gameplay , time in which we learn the game , and we learn to behave ,to figure out what's going on with everything in the game.

The competitive side of this game suffer a lot because of unprepared players which join ranked ,being an exploit for those who smurf/boosting accounts. Not even speak further more about people which bot lvl up accounts ,and people who buy them already lv 30 .

In fact i believe it woulded be helpful ,as a longer gameplay time over an account ,and hack tools would be much more easy to detect and control , therefore the bot leveled up accounts ,or people who lvl up accounts manually and sell would be decreased by a lot.

What else could this change bring , imagine someone flame , gets permanent banned or is on the point of getting permanent banned, while he has multiple accounts he will still have to reach lv 60/90 to play ranked , making him to real consider what behaviour he chose to use ! .

If it makes much more logic ,such a change would have real impact over all the levels ,and i understand that there may be people who like to smurf or train or what ever ,but this measure would have a limited impact over them .. ,is much more to fight back misbehaviour + ranked leaks and frustration it creates when smurfers hover up instant back into ranked with toxicity if they got a permanent ban , or with a gameplay which easy outplay any newbie into ranked ,making new players to wish the leave of the game ,as dota 2 experience this too due to smurf players!.

I one wouldn't be affected ,and i know i played long time before i reach lv 30 , at least 2-3 months ,now you can level up too easy ,you no need rune pages to buy you get them free ,and you also gain much more easier champions to reach the champion pool limit ... , even buy champions of 450 Be just to play ranked. I one had past behaviour problems ,and i know permanent bans haven't fix them , so now i strongly believe it creates a chaos circle , if we don't go up for a change ,is 2020 not 2009 ,we must start to think outbox and see a picture of the cons and pros.",27,1585437142,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fquvzr/veteran_player_experience/,leagueoflegends,0

He has infinite health in lane due to skaarl, meaning he can poke, dismount and remount all for his health back. He has two dashes in the same ability, a stun, a ranged attack that knocks him back and an ultimate that lets him disengage/ engage and roam with ease. With all this i find it hard how to engage on him and get out ahead.

fqudad,OOPS_Studio,ADC and JG flaming me for carrying?,"So.... I've been playing a lot of support recently... I tried out Kayle, Lulu, Blitzcrank, Lux, Morgana, Shen, Sona, Taric, and finally Thresh. I got two S rankings yesterday with Taric (My second and third game with him ever. I buy him, play three games, get an A- and two S) and then I started to notice a bit more of his weaknesses, so I put a break on him and tried out Thresh to compare the two (They feel similar to me... Both tanky, both low DPS, but high CC, but IG Taric is more sustain and Thresh is more aggressive)

Anyway, I tried out Thresh two times today.. I won both games. I go to play a third one with him and my ADC is a level 7 mastery Miss Fortune... We get off to a great start, we're dominating, then she starts doing poorly... I step up my game, get her more opportunities, roam a bit more (since I was more or less fed by this point) and start to initiate teamfights and take dragons. (All 3 of my attempts were successes that resulted in us getting stronger) Two times after a 4v4 one of our enemies would start fleeing and I'd chase them, dropping my lantern behind for a teammate to follow me and they never would... We lost 2-3 kills this way and it cost one of them their life once... So I politely in chat said ""Hehe, you guys can click on my lantern to dash to me if you want"" ""So when I drop it and chase after someone click on it and we can pick up a kill!! :3"" (Almost those exact words with same emoji and everything) and my ADC starts flaming me like ""YEAH I KNOW THAT"" and ""IF I DON'T CLICK ON IT IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO"" (And yes, they were using caps lock) and so I just didn't say anything in chat for a long time to avoid offending anybody... Anyway, then we go back to lane and the enemy initiates a 2v2 (IDK why, because we were like 2 levels ahead) and my teammate gets killed and I end up with a double kill after she's already dead... And my ADC starts flaming me LIKE CRAZY. She swore at me, screamed at me, told me to aim better, all this weird stuff, and then the enemy team agrees to surrender 5/5 like 2 seconds later... K, so now we're in the post-game lobby, the ADC had already left (probably out of rage) and so I bring it up. I said ""My ADC was being toxic all game and IDK why"" and then my JG pitches in and he's like ""YEAH BECAUSE YOU'RE TRASH AHAHA"" and then starts belittling me and being like ""There there Thresh. You'll get better eventually"" and then leaves....

My ADC ended with like 1 / 2 / 3, my JG ended around 2 / 3 / 2, and I ended 3 / 0 / 3... So who deserved the flame? Did I deserve to be treated this way? I know three kills looks bad for a support, but keep in mind that two of those were while my ADC was dead...

Is it just me or does it seem like the only way to not get bullied in this game is to be a jerk? Every time I'm nice to people they take it as a sign of weakness (They must have no idea how hard it is to keep a cool head) and they attack me like crazy... This happens so often to me and IDEK what the deal is. It gets old.",7,1585435365,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqudad/adc_and_jg_flaming_me_for_carrying/,leagueoflegends,1

fqt06n,Boatwhistle,They should have adjustable defensive values and the addition of item slot for practice tool dumbies.,"So I can take the time to figure out ""on paper"" at which armor/hp thresholds it makes better sense to get a BORK vs LDR on a specific champ. The understanding and ability to do so is not a problem. The problems are that I am lazy, it takes time, its not fun. As is the dumbies in the practice tool have 100 armor and 10,000 hp, so using them would tell someone who knows \*nothing\* that blood razor and BORK are the best items for every champion in the game. 

I dont want to do the effort, spend the time, and I wanna have fun. A dumby with pluggable values and six item slots I wouldnt think a difficult addition to the practice tool. While I am sure this is useless to you as I am sure you are the perfect league player incarnate, it would serve as a great way for newer player to learn the relationship of various stats and items in a controlled way that doesnt affect other peoples games.",0,1585430980,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqt06n/they_should_have_adjustable_defensive_values_and/,leagueoflegends,1

fqseiz,LeagueOfGrills,All female League of Legends discord," Hey yall,   

We’re trying to build a grill-gamer friendly community. If you’re a grill, you may have noticed it’s sometimes harsh being a girl alone on the internet, especially on games. Some of you may feel more comfortable befriending girls to play, talk to, chill online in quarantine with, hence why we came up with that server. We’re 87 members, girls only, we go through a verification to make sure you’re a girl, hop in vocal chat, you don’t have to tell us about your life and childhood, just a hello would suffice. Apologize if you don’t get in instantly, we really want to take that seriously and prevent the trolls (yes, you, we see you) from getting in. For the guys out there, it’s not about being feminazis, some of us just really appreciate to have a place where they can chill with girls only when they want to, we know you’re not all assholes but we appreciate to have a choice in the matter with whom we play sometimes.

fqrzsp,omnomazn,Almost every ranked game I've played in the past week has had one or more auto-filled players,"In the past 6 days, I've gone from being 2-0 in Diamond IV promos with 63% win rate to Platinum III with 45% win rate with 18 losses and 3 wins. For context, I ended last season at Diamond II.

tl;dr:

* In two wins, the enemy team had an auto-filled jungle.
* In 5 games, I was auto-filled: three times to jungle, once to support, and once to top (not a big deal, I can play all roles).
* In 7 games, someone on my team said they were auto-filled in the lobby, including one game where I was also auto-filled.
* In 5 more games, I suspect someone on my team was auto filled: they were playing a role they have no history in, with a champion they have no mastery on, and performed very poorly.
* In 4 games, my team had a support main in another role.

11/21 games had confirmed auto-fills on my team, 16/21 had likely auto-fills on my team, and 18/21 had auto-fills on either team. This isn't considering the support mains who didn't get support, which while not auto-fill, often has the same outcome.

These games were all 15-20 minute one sided stomps, with no exceptions. None were close and none had comebacks; there was usually a clear winner by 10 minutes.

I feel like this is becoming a massive problem. Am I the only one experiencing this?

EDIT: While typing this, I got into another game where I'm auto-filled to bottom and the support is also auto-filled",10,1585427777,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqrzsp/almost_every_ranked_game_ive_played_in_the_past/,leagueoflegends,3

fqrv38,Odukomaster,"Fighter Keystones are limiting, and in general, playing them feels awful unless you're ahead. Melee v Ranged matchups need to be reworked","The fact that Conqueror is the only keystone that can be considered to be used purely for sustained damage champions(especially fighters and skirmishers) isn't good at all. All of the other champion classes have at least three keystones that are all viable and flexible for them.

Assassins have essentially all the domination keystones and some can take Conq, FF, or Lethal Tempo.

Mages have essentially the entire sorcery and inspiration trees, as well as some of them also being able to take Conq, DH or electrocute. 

ADCs can take anything in the Precision  page, a few can opt for HoB, DH, or Grasp(Fuck tank Caitlyn)

Tanks can take anything on the resolve page, some can take Conq, PTA(probably only Shen), Unsealed SB, or Glaical.

Supports generally take Aery, but a lot of them can usually flex to other keystones depending on what kind of supp they are playing and the matchup.

But, on the other hand, Fighters generally have very few choices when it comes to viable keystones. Theres Conq, PTA, Grasp, Comet(for people who hate humanity and love poke), or Phase Rush(rarely)

Notice how the other classes with the exclusion of supports, essentially have one tree of runes and keystones tailored specifically to suit their general play style. But, fighters have the most limiting set of viable keystones to pick from, of which the primary one(Conq) had been repeatedly nerfed, which doesn't really help with the fact that they have little impact later on in games unless they are fed.

As a whole, melee champions suffer in lane, due to ranged top picks being so popular now, and out of lane, due to them not being able to snowball well anymore. An overall rework of the melee v ranged matchup in lane would do a great bit when it comes to helping Fighters thrive in what is supposed to be their lane, top.
I can't think of any major changes that would impact noticeably, but a cool thing that I liked when I played DotA 2 is the fact that there's an item, somewhat similar to Dshield which, instead of healing overtime when damaged, gives you a 50% chance to block 20 damage from attacks if you're a melee hero. Adding something like that would be a good step in making the Melee v Ranged matchup better.

Even though I'm going through all this ranting and raving, I don't think a full rework of a class is necessary at this point, just a rework of the matchup between melee and ranged. Including changes to champions that were already designed to specifically have even/good matchups against ranged champions, such as Yasuo, Kass, Jayce(?), and Irelia.

Thanks for reading this far, I hope you have a wonderful day reader. Remember to wash your hands!",9,1585427371,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqrv38/fighter_keystones_are_limiting_and_in_general/,leagueoflegends,3

fqrqh6,Newfypuppie,Playing ADC feels like boxing without being allowed to punch back,"does it matter if the mage bot keeps over extending to get poke in lane? In general, I don't have the CC to punish that.

It's doesn't matter if the enemy top laner over dives to try to get me and wiffs cause it still takes me 5 billions autos to kill him while he can still bash my front line in.

Why does it not matter if the enemy team flops around and can't end when my crit build 6 items isn't even enough to take over a game when two items reduces my total damage output by 30% fucking percent not counting the damage reduction stats stats they give.

If the enemy ap mid misses their combo on me I should naturally kill them in 4-5 aa right? No idea what that feels like because they built a zhonya's and my autos hit for 300 on their nearly 3k sized HP bar.

What use is sustained DPS when initial burst engage combos far out damages your team's health bars.

Why bother with aggressively pushing lane if plating is only split 50% on you and you open yourself up to get ganked by two different 2 people on map. Better to freeze at tower and just walk up when the inevtiable drag/scuttle fights happen.

Oh but's it's fine my positioning is the issue right. That is until you get flash engaged on half a screen away by a camille and wonder why you even bothered logging in today.

it's okay that the meta shifted towards lethality varus, MF, senna all high burst ADC's it's not indicative how sustained DPS is not viable.

Don't worry cause out of the [top ten bot lane champs](https://champion.gg/statistics/#?sortBy=general.winPercent&amp;order=descend&amp;roleSort=ADC) 2 of them are supports, 3 are ap mages, and only 3 of them actually builds a core of crit items.

it's fine that literally, Gosu, saber, and tyler1 all prominent challenger level ADC mains have all role swapped in the past month fed up with the role

fqrbb8,Danetail,I am tired of League.," What's up with Ranked. I don't understand. Why do i get teams that feed and not communicate. And then they blame everyone. How can i win one single game and not get demoted to bronze 2. Tell me, i need an answer. I am done. I am so tired of this game and its cancerous players. What is going on anymore. Every game feels like a circus. Have i been cursed ? What is going on because i don't understand. Why do i always get people that only yell, don't communicate, blame each other and then just feed.  I can't get one drop of joy from this game anymore. Nobody communicates, everyone is cancerous, nobody helps, everyone steals the gold when you are losing your lane so you can lose it even more. And then you need to mute the chat and play. But you can't, because some lane and mostly the jungler are 1/12. And they don't gather to do objectives as a team and turn the tables around. They don't listen to the be careful pings or any pings not even the chat. Then you lose. You just lose. Over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. And you can't do a single thing. The only thing you can do is pray to god that you will get some players that work together peacefully, help each other, and communicate. But it never happens. Just constant yelling, constant pings and the enemy team flames ur team and laughs at you to add wood on the already blazing fire pit of doom that the match is. The single thing you can do here is also mute them and keep your calm. What must one do to get into that cursed gold in hopes of finding players that value and respect each other.  What has my beloved game i had fun memories of become.. ?  I have always been a happy, helpful and positive person and now i find myself mind breaking in games and starting to flame aswell.  I am becoming something i never wanted to be but League just crossed every since one of my limits.

I'm looking for some people to queue normals with while I level my account to learn the game more for work. I was plat way back in S1, and I was a high MMR Dota player, so I have some basic understanding of some stuff. I know almost nothing about most champions/items though, so that's a WIP.

Seems almost every game has ""smurfs"" these days. They don't seem to be particularly good most of the time, just people who were probably forced to make new accounts because of how toxic they are lol. I've been mostly playing support, looking for people who won't give up after 1 death or whatever, noobs or veterans, I don't care.

fqqtq2,DCYOUNG888,What are you Top 3 Favorite Champions?,"Just wondering what are your top 3 favorite champions for playing League of Legends and why for example their playstyle, lore, appearance, etc.?

For me these are my top 5 Favorite Champions

1. Poppy - she is someone who's personality I can relate to in that she does think she is anything special and yet she is very skilled in her job and is already worthy of her hammer (though unaware of it) and I myself don't think highly of myself and yet people have told me I am quite gifted in the things I do. I also like her kit's composition of high cc, tankiness, and peel and yet also has some decent mobility and damage at the same time too (and does not feel overloaded either) and fits my playstyle of getting in the teamfights, disrupting people and soaking damage for the team.
2. Swain - like his vision as a leader and being a commander who has the foresight and always plans ahead of his enemies in lore. I also like his playstyle of being a mage who has decent durability and sustain (via passive and ultimate) while also having utility (w's vision), cc (both passive pull and e root). In addition I have loved birds and do like his bird there in his ultimate (though I wish he still have the bird head in his classic skin).
3. Camille - An intelligent who always analyze the situation and hand and does her best to solve the problem at hand. I enjoy her kit having high mobility and damage that also has decent mobility and cc mixed in too especially her ultimate being an anti-mobility tool for extremely slippery champions such as Zed, Kassadin, etc. and has a very good scaling into the late game.

Honorable mention: Mordekaiser - I like how he subconsciously formed Noxus's three principles that is Strength, Vision, and Guile. I enjoy Mordekaiser's high damage that also shreds tanks and durability via his shield and healing and especially his ultimate being a literal 1v1 cage match (though I do miss his old ultimate too) allowing him to separate the enemy temporarily in teamfights to allow his team a chance to even the odds.",6,1585424089,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqqtq2/what_are_you_top_3_favorite_champions/,leagueoflegends,1

fqq4t4,IAluxI,Dragon Slayer Pantheon's Empowered Q bug still hasn't been fixed,"So I don't know how long this ""bug"" has been in the game but a post on [/r/PantheonMains] (https://www.reddit.com/r/PantheonMains/comments/en1brd/vfx_bug_on_dragonslayer_empq/) gives me the idea that it's been present in the game for a while with countless bug reports and nary a thing done.


[This is what it's supposed to look like ingame](https://i.imgur.com/uQCK7ER.gifv)

[This is what it actually ends up looking like ingame](https://clips.twitch.tv/TacitIncredulousToothSSSsss)

One other issue that comes up with his empowered Q depends on your character quality(based on my own experience). The result is if you're playing on low settings as I do, the empowered Q is invisible and pantheon thrusts his spear with fewer particle effects than the regular Q. This forces me to change my settings if I want to even be able to use the skin. 

[Example](https://i.imgur.com/MF4zfhm.gifv)

Everything about this skin screams badass and there really isn't another epic pantheon skin currently available in the shop. There is Baker Pantheon that is marked at 975 RP that shoots literal butter out of his spear every auto and Q already having more particle effects than Dragon Slayer Pantheon who currently does not shoot a dragon from his spear as advertised(for 1350 RP), but sparks. It makes no sense to me why the most expensive pantheon skin ( who has chromas too btw) isn't one of riot main priorities in regards to skins since it directly hits their pockets. But I can't refund it and my only option for a good Pantheon skin is to buy Baker pantheon. Gj riot you got me.

fqq3dw,DeRecKer22,Why Do Bot Players Feel Like They Should Get All The Kills?,"I'm a support player, and the people I play with get so salty when I take a kill instead of giving it to them. My reasoning is that when I know an opposing player has flash, and I'm afraid they might use it to get away, I use my ability to get the final shot. The ADC's usually get so mad even though I did most of the damage, and they still got the assist. Some even tell me to wait to attack an opponent that is low but still in the lane, so they can come back from recall and kill them when I can easily kill the opponent and not risk them recalling. Can someone please explain why bot players get so triggered about this?",18,1585421718,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqq3dw/why_do_bot_players_feel_like_they_should_get_all/,leagueoflegends,0

fqq2gi,Thegg11,Only an idiot would think elo hell doesnt exist. An even bigger idiot would take ranked seriously.,"FACT: Elo hell exists, despite what the high elo people want you to believe. High elo players get to play in safe match making where they are guarenteed skill teammates and opponents. They do not know what low elo is like and that elo hell is real.

FACT: Only an idiot would take games in low elo seriously, for the reasons mentioned above. There is no competitive integrity and you would be wasting your time taking those games seriously. From the perspective of a support, here are the things you should do in low elo games because fuck it, the outcome is predetermined

* Steal CS from your ADC if they are bad

* Leave your ADC once you have 1k gold for boots of abandoning, if they are bad

* Gank other lanes if they are good, steal CS from other lanes if they are bad

* Leave bot lane 1v2, they will either feed or play under tower

* Take jungle camps from your jungle if he is also bad

* Don't team fight, waste of time if your teammates are garbage, split push all game, because youll have more impact there then you would supporting your garbage team

* Ward only for yourself while you split push, your teams not gonna look at the mini map so no point warding objectives

With that, you make your ranked experience in low elo tolerable, and you get to give payback to elo hell, bad matchmaking, and your garbage teammates. 

And if you are a high elo player who thinks elo hell doesnt exist, duo with me, and I guarantee you will lose more than you win (in 5 games or more), many high elo players deny elo hell, yet refuse to do something that would disprove its existence.

So we sent our adc in the middle and I played bot with our supp. Some minutes pass and obviously we are getting hard denied at bot, with me especialy being completely driven out of the game. Despite the rest of the team's best effords we are losing the entire map, they have 4 to 0 drakes when in the last 2 minutes of the game, this happens.

You always see low elo people saying that getting out of low elo is hard because of the high level of trolls, ints, etc. in reality, it is the opposite, the reason is that while there are only 4 people in your team that can be trolls, there are 5 in the enemy team, it is, therefore, more likely that there are trolls in the enemy team.  
 The way the simulation works is as follows:  
 \- You can’t be a troll.  
 \- Every other person on the match has a %troll chance of being a troll.  
 \- The team that has the lower number of trolls wins.  
 \- In case of the same number of trolls in both teams, there’s a 50% chance of either of them winning.  
 I know this graph isn’t of much use in the practice, but I found funny how unintuitive the results are.",2,1585419492,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqpe6n/i_made_a_simulation_of_winrate_by_of_trolls_these/,leagueoflegends,0

fqoddl,PmMeKaisaPorn,Stop Using Kid Gloves And Buff Kaisa For Real,"I've tried her on the PBE and the most recent buff will end up doing next to nothing as far as helping Kaisa's win rate you don't max E on Kaisa you max Q.

At 46% her win rate is the 4th lowest in the entire game, and the lowest for any ADC.

Rito nerfed her right before preseason instead of waiting to see the new meta from all the changes.

&amp;#x200B;

Give back her full amount of damage on isolated Q, 25-50 extra range, higher base AS, higher base AD,  give back the AD ratio on W, change Q evolve to 95 instead of 100 AD so we can build SR again, more damage on the passive, give more attack speed on her E at all ranks instead of a cd buff at max rank pick at least one of these or some other early game buff.

Kaisa needs early power to compete with MF,Senna, Caitlyn

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care if she becomes 100% pick ban in pro play they get paid to play, let them figure out how to deal with it if that's what it takes for her to hit 50% win rate in Plat+ solo Q.

&amp;#x200B;

Stop being so cautious and give her real buffs like rito did for Ezreal when he hit 46%,  I'm not unhappy they buffed Ezreal he badly needed it Kaisa is in the same situation now due to all her nerfs last year.",27,1585416277,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqoddl/stop_using_kid_gloves_and_buff_kaisa_for_real/,leagueoflegends,0

fqo6ob,Regath,Alternatives to Blitz?,"Hello,

I'm a returning player and the new runes system is still complete ass to me. I've been using Blitz to suggest, modify then import pages. I hate how intrusive the ads are. Especially the pop-out video player with nothing but the Blitz logo just for more ads is broken as hell, making the client post-games almost unusable.

Is there an alternative not made by absolute doughnuts? I mostly care about runes and builds, then enemy team stats (mmr, main role, premade status, etc.).

fqngxo,DinoWreck,This is my last post on this subreddit,"This is my last post. Yes. I'm completely serious. You see, I'm not who you all think I am. Not at all. Currently, I'm a writer for Alabama Post, living in a small studio apartment, always looking for the next big story, barely scraping by sometimes. I was asked several months ago by my editor to do a piece on the so-called 'League of Legends' community on Reddit that seems to become more and more popular by the day. Initially, I was intrigued. The humor was bizzare, yet interesting. Nonsensical, yet genius. I spent several months interacting with people I had never met before in my life, learning the culture, hating on Yasuo and Zoe, learning how to be an analyst while being only Silver 3, making Reddit Threads about content creators, what was an ""insane play"" and what wasn't. Eventually, I began to make my own posts, testing the waters now and then. And eventually my own posts started getting noticed, and maybe for a minute or two I understood why you all do this. But that didn't last long. And with time, I began to notice how stale the content truly was. How the same 'memes' could be spammed over and over again, and still get massive amounts of attention. And I also began to notice something else. The viciousness with which you attacked each other. The semi-constant bullying and harassment. Each day, it made me even more sickened than before, to the point where you people made me start questioning everything about reality and what I knew about it. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I was drinking 2 bottles of milk every night. But, finally, my mission is complete. Tomorrow, we will be publishing a piece on ""the League of Legends Reddit Community”, potentially exposing some of your admins' most well kept secrets. I'm deactivating this account at midnight, but before I do, I just want to let you know you all make me sick.",7,1585413317,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqngxo/this_is_my_last_post_on_this_subreddit/,leagueoflegends,2

fqnbzn,haji1823,I created a short story about how the rest of the demons similar to Fiddlesticks would be able to be added to the lore and league.,"Disclaimer: i don’t remember too much about Demacia lore or Ezreals lore so if this contradicts anything just let me know. Also im not the best at writing stories so feedback is welcome

A future to be scared of:

Ezreal sauntered into Madam Margaret’s fortune teller shop. Normally a place like this wouldn’t even be thought of to visit but today felt special, like Ezreal needed to be here. Ezreal sat down in front of Madam Margaret, with a crystal ball separating them. “So, I see you have come seeking what the future holds for you” She said with an eeriness that made even the air feel like it was in slow motion.

“Why yes, I don’t expect much to come of this but I feel like I need to be here.” She looked at Ezreal with what appeared to be disdain. After a moment she held her arms in front of the crystal ball and started speaking a language Ezreal had never heard before. Her face clearly showed confusion and then her complexion turned ghastly. After another minute she opened her eyes with what almost appeared to be tears showing in her eyes. 

“Before I tell you your future, I will first need to tell you the history of Demacia, this information has been lost to time but your future would not make sense without this knowledge. Demacia was not always a city fearful of magic, they used to be one of the strongest magical communities in the world. Many centuries ago they learned of another realm, one full of darkness and death. They sent in groups of soldiers to try and discover what existed in this new world they uncovered.
 What they didn't expect was this world to be inhabited, not by people, but by someone far worse. I know you have heard the stories of the Demons surrounding Demacia but those demons are nothing compared to what was found on the other side of the portal. This portal soon had things escaping that even the strongest of mages could not stop. 

One demon in particular caused them to hastily shut the portal down. This demon radiated fear towards every living thing around it. The mages were able to close the portal but were worried the demons that escaped would be able to reopen it, so they created a key, they charged the key with arcane energy and used it to seal the portal, then removed all magic from the key so that the only way the portal can be opened is by someone using lost magic to charge the key.

 The demon of fear returned for the key, he killed hundreds of Demacian soldiers and civilians to get it. The demon was unable to open the portal as the key no longer had life to it so he kept the key with him and disappeared. Demacia couldn't risk having this portal opened again and banned all magic from the city walls. They had a guardian created to protect them should any mages try to reopen the portal. Over time people forgot about the portal, but they never forgot about magic, this fear of magic soon grew to hate. Causing leaders to imprison any magic users.” 

Ezreal was absording her story word for word. This news about Demacia is something he has never heard before, nobody that he has spoken to before has ever said that Demacia was a city of magic centuries ago. “So what does this story have to do with my future, it doesn't seem like this has anything to do with me?” 

“Why Ezreal, this story was because you needed to know what was going to happen. The portal is going to reopen soon, and the demons will be released.” If possible she was somehow even paler than before. “But I still don't see how this is related to me. The story was nice but nothing here makes sense for how it's a part of my future.”

“This has everything to do with you Ezreal, because with your gauntlet of lost magic you will be the one who dooms this world. You will be the one to reopen the portal and release the demons into this world”",2,1585412860,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqnbzn/i_created_a_short_story_about_how_the_rest_of_the/,leagueoflegends,1

What other tips do you have for aspiring Jungle mains or veteran players that are feeling a bit sluggish? Has there been a pocket pick that's turned out well for you so far this Season? And of course, what do you guys think of the article?! Feedback is always appreciated!

fqn44h,Alineast,How about a Donation Stream by Riot,"Everyone who watched the LEC (Don't know about the other regions since I don't got the time to watch them even though I'm only at home) noticed the Problems they had in Week 8 Day 1 and in Week 9 Day 1 (they fixed a lot for Week 8 Day 2). And because the LEC is only on Fridays and Saturdays it seems to be hard to fix those due to just a few games. 
So my Idea was, as the title says, a donation event by Riot in which the Casters and Streamers(and Pros) could play, maybe on Tuesdays and Wednesdays so they have something to do while being locked at home and they do it for a good purpose.


This Idea is kinda naive but I feel like this could make fixing the Problems easier, would help in this time by supporting those who are looking for a cure/ the people who can't afford treatment, something like that and last but not least would be entertaining.



This said, stay safe and stay at home.

&amp;#x200B;

So recently i've seen quite a lot of smurfs in my games which impacts the game mostly in a negative way. On my perspective and the enemy teams perspective. And i'm expecting a lot of comments saying its just 1 game or just deal with it. Honestly i think atleast 2/5 games of mine have a smurf and i noticed it legit doesn't matter if they are on your team or the enemy team because they simply do not care about their rank. So for example i had a jax in my game which just didn't care anymore he has high mmr anyway so he just went his way and trolled while i'm playing adc and basically not giving me the opportunity to play the game.

My question is. That i get it that's it's hard to get these smurfs out because you can buy/level an account on your own. But because of the amount of people that are smurfing it just makes the game so much unfun. And hard to play. But there is no possible way to have a system that high mmr players get with other high mmr players in there own league? Since i've seen sooo many smurfs is this not possible?",4,1585410077,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqmh93/the_beloved_smurfs_in_your_or_enemy_team/,leagueoflegends,1

fqli4r,Dynamyght,Shaco is the ultimate ADC.,"Self Peel with boxes and slow on autos.

&amp;#x200B;

cleanse built into kit (you can dodge abilities with your ultimate negating the damage from things like Malphite R, garen R, Vi R,)

&amp;#x200B;

ALSO! When clone is active, shaco arguably has some of the highest right-click DPS. You're clone has 60% of your attack damage, meaning shaco benefits roughly 60% greater than other ADCs from raw AD. The dummies in the practice tool don't seem to account for his clones DPS but assuming it is truly 60% of his standard 720 DPS with full build (assuming you are always getting backstabs) shaco will do 1151 damage per second. If you enter a fight with Q and take hail of blades, you can deal about 2000 damage in less than a second purely with auto attacks(once again assuming you always get backstabs, which is actually fairly straightforward if you have blue smite and hail of blades)",6,1585406851,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqli4r/shaco_is_the_ultimate_adc/,leagueoflegends,1

fqkz5m,SpectraQWERTY,"Senna - Everything Kindred and Kog'maw ever wanted to be, and a suggestion on further nerfs concerning how dominant she still is","Notice : This post is full of personal thoughts and spite against this certain champion Riot released, and it's all my own opinion. I will gladly take any harsh feedback as i am only a low gold player.  


Senna the Reedemer. A champion that i ban every single ranked game as an ADC or a Support (Unless i ban Yuumi), is in my opinion, a definate powerpick that is still dominating the meta after 4 patches of nerfs, and i suggest giving her further treatment. For a champion that has a passive that stacks indefinitely by just waving auto attacks and abilities, while not being punishable because of her high range, high mobility and strong sustain, her early game is not even a glimmer of how bad Kindred and Kog'maw early game are. Her strong suit, of also being a support who also usually have their damage boosted early game means that an ADC can't outrade her early game.  
Comparing this to Kindred, who has a random generated mark on enemy monsters as a passive and a predictable gank pattern once a champion is selected, thus easily countered by playing safe once marked, and the vile nature of the jungle where powerpicks such as lee sin, elise, olaf kha'zix and many more who can easily invade or fast clear their own jungle exist, making her getting further marks even a more tougher task, she only has 500 starting range and her only way into the game is by cheese ganking. It takes 4 marks to increase Kindred's range by 75,after which the range is increased by 25 every 3rd stack, while only 20 to increase Senna's range by 25. That means, to reach the 600 range mark, the starting range at which Senna starts the game at, Kindred needs to complete 7 hunts. With the first hunt being the scuttler, if uncontested she still needs to do 3 more hunts. Now if we consider the luck factor, lets say you had an early gank with getting a stack. That bringing u to 2 stacks by 3:30 in the game. Your next hunt is gonna be a 1/3 chance of landing on scuttler, ur most safe option, and the 2 other marks are gonna land inside enemy territory. Remember, this happens at 4:15 game time, where the oppressive early game junglers still dominate, and if you dont get your stack, you are forced into ganking for the next 40 seconds.  
But anyway, i am losing the track of thought by explaining how Kindred passive works instead of focusing on the subject. I am suggesting this towards the Senna situation : Bring her basic starting auto attack range down to 450 - 500, her Q range to 450 - 500 and let her get 75 range increase after the first 20 stacks of her passive, while the 2nd 20 stacks giving her 50 range,and every other 20 stacks yielding the normal amount of range increase by 25, capped at 250 range.   


This would make her choose how to trade more effectively early game while also being further exposed to reach of enemy adc and support abilities, having her play more carefully into pick champs such as leona, thresh, blitz and nautilus. This would be a massive nerf to her abusive early game power, and  capping the passive at 250 range would reduce her lategame dominance which is what i think  riot should do with this champion.

fqky6a,NotAitorek,Exploit Champ Select (Not losing LPs dodging),"Hi everyone,

My name is Aitorek, OTP Heca in EUW.

Theres a guy in D1/Master EUW bugging every champ select he doesnt feel like winning

Its prolly the 5th or 6th time he does it

His name is ""Quote me if int"" and basicly leaves the champ select before the game starts, but doesnt dodge

Then, when its about to start, the classic msg "" \[System Notification\] Your match will start soon. Please wait as we load up your game. This process should not take more than a few minutes "" pops up.

Im 99,9% he does some kind of exploit in order to dont lose LPs once he doesnt get to play Yuumi or the enemy comp is better.

fqkddr,StemitzGR,Clash means no one plays league for the day due to ping.,"Don't get me wrong I love clash but I find it so hard to argue with Riot's logic.
2 Weeks now Eune has major lag issues due to clash and they keep it running instead of trying to fix the server issue.
I don't believe anyone wants to play clash with this ping,and the worst thing is that you can't play league at all during the clash tournaments.
Just for context I usually sit around 60 Ms which transforms to 150 during clash,this also happens to all my friends so it's not my Internet.
I am not demanding a fix right now as I understand that it must be very hard to balance the huge server load,but you could disable it until you fix the ping issue.",84,1585402852,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqkddr/clash_means_no_one_plays_league_for_the_day_due/,leagueoflegends,1

fqkcya,Fikkia,[Suggestion] Give Taric a reason to use more charges of Starlight's Touch,"I know Taric isn't weak, but it would be nice to see a more tactical use of his Q. Starlight's Touch is an odd combo. The efficiency becomes less of an issue late game, which means by then there's no tactical use for essentially using ranks 3-5 of the skill, as the charges are all it adds. 5 is also not a great number for charging as it's at odds with his Bravado, making reaching 5 charges quite a pain, or at least inefficient compared to 4 charges.

So, here's a couple of suggestions:

 **PASSIVE:** **Taric** stores a charge of *Starlight's Touch* periodically, up to a maximum at once. 📷 [Bravado](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Taric#Bravado) empowered attacks grant one charge **and reduce the recharge by 25%**. **Starlight Touch's healing is increased by 10% per stored charge.**

This change makes it so 2 abilities will provide 5 stacks, instead of 4. It also adds an exponential element to stacks. With this change the final healing would be:

1 Charge:  
Old:  30 (+ 20% AP) (+ 1% of Taric's **maximum** health)   
New: 33 (+ 22% AP) (+ 1.1% of Taric's **maximum** health) 

5 Charges:  
Old:  150 (+ 100% AP) (+ 5% of Taric's **maximum** health)   
New: 225 (+ 150% AP) (+ 7.5% of Taric's **maximum** health)

Base numbers could change, but the main point is extra stacks can compound on each other to have a marked difference between 2 and 5 stacks, making it more efficient in terms of healing as well as mana, with a 5 stack providing \~7.5 stacks of old healing. This makes the choice of using the heal to cooldown other abilities or using other abilities to charge your heal more pressing, as the extra value is significant. And at the same time you need to weigh how much your team needs healing in the immediate future.",6,1585402808,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqkcya/suggestion_give_taric_a_reason_to_use_more/,leagueoflegends,1

fqjwm9,mortychichi,Garena is forcing players to gamble for Cosmic/Dark Cosmic Lux. How is this even allowed?,"Garena is the publisher of League of Legends in Hong Kong/Taiwan/Southeast Asia. Here we buy League Points instead of Riot Points (1 LP ≒ 3.5 RP; a Legendary Skin worth 1820 RP is 510 LP) with real currency.

Instead of releasing Cosmic Lux and Dark Cosmic Lux directly in the shop for 510 LP each, they made them limited skins (which means they're even kept out of Hextech chests) and in order to obtain them, we have to play a roulette gambling game where these 2 skins are the ""top prizes"".

Some people have spend 3-4 times the LP than what we would've paid if these skins were directly released in the shop like any other Legendary skins, and they still haven't gotten the skin yet. 

How can they even get away with this? They've done the exact same thing to Galaxy Slayer Zed and Dark Cosmic Jhin already; nowadays whenever a new Legendary Skin is out they refuse to sell it directly and want players to gamble for them (with players often spending 3-4 times the original price tag before finally ""winning"" the skins)",359,1585401031,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqjwm9/garena_is_forcing_players_to_gamble_for/,leagueoflegends,1

fqjo74,MooseMaster3000,Phantom Hit shouldn't work the way it does,"It should not add to counters for abilities that happen every *nth* attack, nor should it reduce cooldowns an additional tick. There needs to be an exception in place so that those types of effects aren't doubled. Because the effects themselves don't *hit*. 

The way it works now is like if non-damaging abilities applied spell effects. So, say, you could kill someone with Luden's or Liandry's via Whimsy or Terrify. Or if Conqueror didn't have the ""damaging abilities"" condition and you could just get an additional stack from Lee's Cripple or the first part of Death Mark. 

Every single iteration of the Phantom Hit passive has been a detriment for the game because all but one of the champions with nth hit abilities and on-hit reduced cooldowns were created before the effect existed. It started with Sated Devourer dominating the meta until it had to be removed, and now even after switching it to every 3rd attack it's stronger than ever thanks to buffs to particular champions and effects. 

At the very least, the Phantom Hit should only include damaging effects instead of breaking the balancing aspects of certain abilities.",5,1585400085,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqjo74/phantom_hit_shouldnt_work_the_way_it_does/,leagueoflegends,1

fqjlvq,BeautyOfGoodbye,Hope this IG vs. SN game Shows Riot just how Worthless Normal Talon is,"3/0 mid laner with a LW second item literally can't even step near Ornn or Lee, much less do any relevant damage. That is exactly what Talon has to look forward if Riot goes through with the W nerfs to gut Q-maxing Conqueror Talon. 

So basically, the gist of things is that back near the end of S8, when Talon was legitimately broken and Lethality Riven was a thing, Riot nerfed the fuck out of Lethality items. Also, they nerfed some of the champions that used Lethality. Also also, they gutted Electrocute's burst and basically removed Sudden Impact as a rune. Please note that this lovely combo was actually the official end to old Wukong being viable, which slowly but directly led to the bullshit monster we currently have to permaban, so kudos to Riot. Then, onto Season 9. This was already a dogshit season with Riot failing to fix the fact that a simple Tabi buy can negate a full Lethality item's penetration and instead adding a lifeline shield to PD. At the end of the season, Riot promises to un-ruin the life of AD assassins, but what they actually do is gut Edge of Night's Lethality, completely remove the vision denial of Duskblade, and ""compensate"" with two items that no assassin will actually use. 

Now, we're a few months into Season 10. Seeker's Armguard is still more oppressive than the Chinese government, and well-designed champions like Vlad and Sett are steadily boosting low diamond players into GM+. Lethality is now so garbage that champions like Talon and Zed are literally picking after the table scraps of bruisers. They have to, because their choices are one, adapt to the meta by abusing Conqueror/DD/Steraks, or two, lose their team the game in champ select. Obviously, it's ""not working as intended"" and kinda exploitative for assassin champions to build sustain and play long-duration fights, but I really hope Riot could do some compensation buffs as they are closing this door.",1,1585399819,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqjlvq/hope_this_ig_vs_sn_game_shows_riot_just_how/,leagueoflegends,1

fqivqp,kitho04,Fiora needs a nerf. Direct or indirect.,"I think Fiora is extremely OP right now. The problem is not that she has few bad matchups, but that her good matchups appear to be the best toplaners right now. (Darius, Sett, Mordekaiser, Aatrox etc.). Also she is far too punishing since her q and e work on towers. If you get killed or just forced out once without TP, you will lose (at minimum) one plate. And because of her snowbally nature and insane chase potential everyone will get shit on hard by her once she gets a lead. I think she it is too easy to snowball with her once you get a tiny advantage. You either have to buff her bad matchups, the like of Quinn, Kayle or Malphite. Cause at the moment the only thing Fiora has to do to be in a playable or good matchup is ban Wukong. The other solution would be to directly nerf her, I think a good approach would be  to nerf her q dmg to towers or the movement speed from vitals.",8,1585396810,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqivqp/fiora_needs_a_nerf_direct_or_indirect/,leagueoflegends,1

Since all of us are in quarantine, -facing hard times that hopefully might end soon-,  here's a fun thing to do that is also very beneficial for your health!

**Do 5 push-ups for each death in a league of legends game!**

This was inspired by a random post on subreddit for Programmers which recommends doing 10 push-ups for each error you get,  so I decided to share the idea with you!

The first time I did it, I went against a one for all team of Wukongs as Vayne..hard times.

&amp;#x200B;

I do know that some of you might be doing sort of things of regular basis, but I thought it would be nice to share it!

Have a good day!

Plays can also be rated, so we can eventually know the best play of the season! Everyone can post and rate a play, you just need to have an account. To post a play, use the tournament list to find the game, and you can directly paste the link of the clip (from youtube, twitch or streamable) on the ‘Plays tab’.

I hope the community will enjoy this feature and help me build this pro plays database!!

How about you start giving Master Yi and Taric some proper nerfs? Individually nerf both champions. Even without a funnel, Master Yi is still broken. All funnel does is makes Master Yi get his Bloodrazor and Rageblade faster that allows him to 1v5 while being 0/20.

Open your thick heads and start nerfing the source of funnel. There are no more funnel comps. Nunu + Karthus doesn’t exist anymore. Notice how all funnel comps revolve around Master Yi? Maybe because Master Yi is broken?

(im a jungle player),"im a jungle player i only play jungle if i dont get jungle i say ""give me jungle or i int"" and they usually give but if they dont i hover zed support or yuumi mid and then they always give but this game i didnt have to i got jungle role assigned  
all 3 lanes lost and we got 1 to 4 dragons but i got most kills on the team  
I tried to 1 vs 1 the fed enemy adc but i couldnt i died to her  
and like thats my adcs fault not mine for playing jungle lol  
like i only killed the enemy top over and over after my own top died(so my top wouldnt ks me)  
but like my bot fed ashe so much my 15 kills didnt even matter! She just ulted me and killed me in ult stun  
how is it my fault my 3 lanes lost?  
they should have just played better  
Its not my job as the jungler to win their lanes for them  
AND MY MID WHO DIDNT EVEN HAVE HALF MY KILLS SAID BETTER JUNGLE WINS AFTER WE LOST!  
How did vi do better than me she had 6 less kills???   
I told the mid to uninstal cuz hes garbage cuz he doesnt even have half my kills  
And he like said that ""even with those kills you couldnt even 1 vs 1 the enemy adc youre garbage""  
And i told him that im not garbage i have more kills than him he doesnt even have half of mine hes garbage  
And then he said ""you have 31k damage done in 47 minutes with all those kills wow""  
And i was like so??????? i got more kills than u that means im better noob  
And he said like ""no you arent you did 31k damage in 47 minutes""  
And he left the lobby  
And like i reported him for hatespeech and harrasment and negative attitude  
Why are people so dellusional that they cant accept more kills=better players and they need to find excuses  
Anyways im done i think im taking a break from league of legends im so done with all these toxics that dont know how to play and then say i should stop playing jungle or that im bad at jungling and having the most kills on the team on jungle isnt a good thing or whatever like they are just jealous they cant be as good as my but these ppl hold me back and im stuck in silver and i think if lol was a 1 vs 1 game i would be diamond at least but these no kill noobs hold me back unfair",17,1585392346,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqhv0p/why_are_my_teammates_so_toxic_af_when_im_so_good/,leagueoflegends,1
fqhtdb,_GrapeSoda_,Help me decide between maining Jungle or ADC,"After a month or two of returning to LoL I've decided that I have 2 roles that I'd consider becoming a specialist within. I've hit a hard dilemma though and it's blocked my ability to choose between these 2 roles. 

Thought I'd compare the two roles below and my personal opinions/skill basis around the two:

Jungle

* More enjoyment within this role, I find myself watching more Jungle and trying to learn. It's the role I wish I was best at. However this is easily my weakest role out of all the roles in the game and I struggle the most with
* My mechanics are the only reason I win games within JG
* My general knowledge and decision making is awful in JG and I constantly mess up, dont get enough objectives, don't know when to gank, tracking etc. 
* Lowest win rate, lowest impact no matter how fed I get I don't know how to carry in this role of be impact of any sort.  

ADC 

* Enjoyable, but does feel stale at times, yet this is by far my strongest role out of all of them and I'm consistently dominating lane with this role. 
* My mechanics allow me to carry and correlate strongly with this role as mechanics are something an ADC should have 
* I'm able to win games with high damage, high cs and low deaths and find my positioning to be good within team fights and laning and general knowledge around this role is far greater. 
* Highest win rate, I've consistently had 80%+ win rates on my past accounts and have climbed to gold/plat before getting banned for thinking being toxic was cool. 

My goals are to generally climb to High elo and be able to play within that environment at the best of my ability and enjoy the game at the same time. I love improving and learning new things within this game, so my main goal is honestly to just climb to Diamond+ hopefully and continue to improve. Any help is appreciated greatly.

I experience significant FPS drops in game, especially during teamfights, and sometimes even randomly  for a few seconds during the laning phase. I have tried everything: turning graphics the lowest, capping the FPS, and all the other tips found on the internet. All the other games play just fine, only League is constantly FPS dropping.

My specs are:

Nvidia GT 1030 2gb

Stuff like this for example really annoys the shit out of me and im just into a game where I dont have fun for 20 to 30 mins.

Ristan  is the master of written magic and spells such as runes, glyphs,  sigils, and symbols. His discovery in magic arts begun with obsession in  old forgotten Runeterran lore and ancient languages.

While  casting spells Ristan starts slowly scribe them for one second, in that  time his unique passive Perfect Calligraphy allows him to combine two  ability together for more power full spell; or he can instantly cast one  ability by taping it again. Ristan combined abilities have answer for a  lot situations if you can find it in time.

Ristan  should be mainly support or on this way to mid lane. His Battle Hymn  passive combined with Nashor's Tooth could be a thing.

Anyone notice this wrong pricing issue?

If you own Lux and both her skins, you can only get the 2 borders from this bundle. 

FYI, the bundle without Lux champ costs 3511 RP. One Cosmic Lux skin costs 1820 RP and after the first one you can buy the other one for 1001 RP. That said, the 2 Cosmic Lux skins cost 2821 RP in total, meaning that the 2 borders should worth 690 RP (3511-2821), which makes sence for the discount as well, 1100 × (100%-37%) = 693.

But now it is priced at 1101 RP. 1100 RP discounted by 37% becomes 1101 RP, Rito pls.

Even my kid won't do this math wrong.",0,1585386973,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqgr6r/galaxies_2020_lux_border_set_wrong_pricing_issue/,leagueoflegends,1

fqgn32,benjib421,VS simulator NEEDED for TFT,"VS simulator NEEDED

First post here, but I use to play competitive pokemon go pvp and enjoyed nothing more than running comps that were not meta. This landed me in the top 3% of players. Now to my point, the only way I was able to do this was because there was a simulator that ran pokemon against each other and allowed you to see how they would do. 

I have looked for a while, but cannot find something like this for TFT. I feel like if people could put comps together and have them Sim against another comp mainly meta comps there would be more diversity in games. This would make people more willing to experiment with champions without having to go through a whole game or a bunch to see how viable the comp is hoping you go against certain comps. 

Just a though, but would like to hear from the community about this.",5,1585386367,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqgn32/vs_simulator_needed_for_tft/,leagueoflegends,1

This is my first ever post and I'm **Oppaí Senpaí**. I'm looking to make a longterm Clash Team of likeminded players who want to grow and have high aspirations to reach their utmost potential, and hopefully meet lifelong friends as well!

I'm a Platinum Tier I Support Main:

[https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Oppa%C3%AD+Senpa%C3%AD](https://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Oppa%C3%AD+Senpa%C3%AD)

with a highly versatile and aggressive playstyle. I had a group of friends who I grew up and played every online game with, but they all left not so long ago to play much newer titles as I haven't finished my dream gaming PC yet and I was left to play League alone. I knew that it was inevitable as I knew that they didn't have the same drive I did to get better or at the very least, no longer found League as the same fun game we all got hooked into during its Season 2 (2012} It's been a while now that I hoped to find a new set of friends that would make me look forward to turning my computer on and have the same goofs and gaffs and make memories that would last a lifetime as my previous friends gave me. Hopefully, I'll meet you guys soon to practice for the upcoming Clash Tournament tomorrow!

Please add me on League: **Oppaí Senpaí**

fqg5cp,EroWarrior,Bugs and a few request.,"Hello.

There are a few minor bugs I find and it would be good if they get fixed.

First is you can zoom in client (Mac version) if you double tap or pinch:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](74vof58wfdp41 ""Evidence."")

Second is when you play CO-OP vs AI if you select a champ that needs Trinity Force it will suggest you need Phage, Sheen and Zeal to build it instead of Phage, sheen and Stinger.

Third bug and the most annoying one is when you closed league client by clicking on cross it wont close all of league programs that are open. League of legends and Riot client will remain open and you have to close them in Activity monitor.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all of bugs that somehow trigger me when they happens it would be good if they get fixed. Also can you add an option to hide TFT missions in missions tab? I don't have a problem that you changed its system but some people simply wont play TFT and I was very disappointed when I saw I have 3 new missions and thought Lux mission had started but it turns out to be TFT missions.

If you needs evidence for co-op vs ai bug or client not closing just tell me I have a very bad net now but will replicate them and send you its screenshots.

fqfy0b,FinlandKiwi,A breath of fresh air,"Heres a couple champions, if nerfed, would be a breath of fresh air for the meta (and off-meta).

1: Lee Sin

2: Zoe

3:Pyke (Lane)

4: Taric (Mostly cuz of funneling)

5: Garen

Lee sin: boring to go up againist and will always do good late game unless the player is really bad

Zoe: I don't play a lot of mid, but when I do I ban Lux. Then Zoe is picked and I consider suicide as she 1-shots me with just a ludens.

Pyke: Just a dumb pick that shouldn't work. If they nerfed his AA dmg thatd be nice. I say nake his Q go through monster/minions again so he can jg. I support it.

Taric: I dont need to explain.

Garen: I see his getting nerfed, but who though it was ok that he could smack half your health with 1 Q. I might be biased on this one a little more.


If they buffed these champs id be cool.

1: Twitch (Jg clear mostly) 

2: Akali (Hear me out)

3: Nasus

4:  Soraka

5: For lack of a better option, AD Shaco.


1: I don't play a lot of Twitch anymore, but I hopped on him and its just a terrible clear (could be because im bad) though I wish it wasnt so bad. His a fun jg.

2: Now I play her on occasion. Like a family get together that ends weirdly with a cousin. If I win or lose I just dont play her for like a week after the match, but these changes to her R are kinda wack.

3: First champ I bought with IP and I had to pretend I knew what stacking was when someone asked. Recently he feels lackluster. The new changes look promising, but I dont know.

4: She got hella gutted. I know why. Toplane soraka (honestly good riddance) the champ now feels stupid to play imo.

5: I like Shaco. I try to convince myself that im a good shaco (prolly not) I like AD over AP and it seems like AD is nerfed more than AP for shaco. Even though AP hits different.


That was my list. These changes seems viable to me, but what do I know? Feel free to leave your opinions. Try not to be too rude. Its not a rage post.",6,1585382485,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqfy0b/a_breath_of_fresh_air/,leagueoflegends,1

fqfeh7,Juiceemang,Getting frustrated,"Started playing a week ago. My main is miss fortune. But I have tried many others as well. Initially it was fun because it was new and we were winning. What I know so far, creep score is biggest factor in the game, go online to see what builds are best for your character, ward everything, don’t feed your opponent, fight as a team. Questions I ask myself during games, how did he kill me so fast, how have they killed that many minions, why won’t that guy die, when to attack when not to, how do I control my wave, who am I strong/ weak against, how am I suppose to remember all of this.  I don’t care about kills I just want to win with my team and understand how we did it. This is my first Moba game I have ever played, there is so much in this game, and I just want to understand it. I’m level 17 now, this is my mindset when I go into a game. Find my build for my character, buy items, place wards, try to kill as many minions as possible, if the enemy is close attack them here and there. If the opportunity is there for me to kill them I do. Go back and buy items. Go back to my lane my enemy is same level or even stronger, kills me easily and I play scared for the rest of the match while they increase their creep score and occasionally kill me.

fqf0zo,omnomazn,I feel like Diamond IV needs some sort of intervention,"I was excited to finally hit Diamond, but now that I’m here, I’m equal parts disappointed and disgusted I’m how poor the game quality has become.

I feel like I’m watching the same script play out and over and over. One team gets ahead 15+ kills in the first 10-15 minutes and wins the game without comeback mechanics having a chance to come into play. Even just slightly below this MMR, in Platinum, the game quality was massively better. There were regularly comebacks and close games, which I have yet to see even once at Diamond.

I think a large part of this is that the majority of players here are hyper aggressive and not necessarily good at decision making. In most cases, someone will die early on and then continue to die by trying to make plays or taking fights they can’t win while behind.

Another major problem I’ve noticed is players on a loss streak locking in random zero mastery champions and losing hard. I’m noticing this in maybe 1/3 of my games; it’s like they aren’t even trying to win.

Can anyone think of anything that could reasonably done to improve the game experience at Diamond IV? I’m actually finding it so consistently bad that I’m on the verge of quitting, and I doubt I’m the only one who doesn’t enjoy this.",4,1585377692,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqf0zo/i_feel_like_diamond_iv_needs_some_sort_of/,leagueoflegends,1

fqencz,valenote,"ARAM ranked mode, the new competitive ranked mode.","I know how dumb ranked ARAM sounds but hear me out. Alright, so this is how it's going to work.

  
Each team gets 15 champions to choose from, so like the amount you'd see if everyone was assigned a champion and everyone rerolled twice. You get X amount of time to talk out who's playing what. It's not summoner's rift so you won't be arguing over rolls.   


**The catch is, the champions rolled will be visible for both teams.** Now you have to figure out what the enemy might pick, and pick around that. Do you all in the poke? What if they drafted a really strong front lone, and they're going to play the long game. Eventually, they'll be able to run you down if you don't beat them fast enough.  


Let's not act like ARAM doesn't have a meta outside of that. Sustain items are king, and certain champions can be played in different ways they wouldn't be able to be played in summoner's rift. You won't see warmogs Soraka in regular ranked, but she'll be an oppressive pick in ARAM.

Ranked ARAM will reward players with a larger champion pool.

At the end of the day: TCG have a huge random factor but controlling the RNG, and having multiple game plans mean they're still really competitive. ARAM is no different. Likewise, if TFT can be ranked, why can't ARAM?",3,1585375821,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqencz/aram_ranked_mode_the_new_competitive_ranked_mode/,leagueoflegends,1

Riven is sitting at a 46% winrate in high elo over the last two days. It seems as if the DD nerfs to her have hit hard and I don't believe a minimal HP regen buff is not going to change a thing. If we are looking at diamond+ she is at a 49% win rate which is due to players being worse than that of higher elo. The champ is playable, but if they are actually attempting to adjust her win rate a tiny HP buff will not suffice. I suggest an e revert since she has received nothing but direct and indirect buffs since last season. Her e was never the problem. It was the combination of shojin, old conquerer, and old DD. Now with all of those being gone, what is the reason for riven to continue having her e nerfed? Seems illogical. Buffing her shield may not be the only solution, however, it is definitely a big help to her overall kit.",17,1585374513,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqedad/state_of_riven/,leagueoflegends,1

fqe0it,GCharizard,Know When to Cut Your Losses (Confessional into Advice into Possible Q&amp;A),"Be me. In your 20s, stress gets to you, you try to play Ranked to get your mind off things. You then find yourself in a hard losing match up, you hesitate. You then flame everyone, your mid and jungler, your opponent for being ""lucky."" You don't have a good time, your enemy jungler ends up being 10/2 while you just sit there and type insult after insult on your keyboard. You leave the end game lobby, queue up, and suddenly: you're perma-banned. On your third account. That you spent money on just to play the game. **Don't. Be. Me.**

I've played this game ever since I was in sixth grade. It was mostly for fun most of the time, Casual is the good life. Then I hit 30 and unlocked Ranked. I pop in. I get my ass flamed harder than a George Foreman grill. I felt bad, it made me sad. But I was also very interested. Casual and Ranked are two completely different worlds, which excited me. Fast forward several years. I've experienced good and bad, but my last recent years have been bad. Pitifully bad. My main account got banned around 2016-2017-ish. It shook me, frightened me. I'm now the static that I loathed years ago. Fast forward again where I'm typing this Reddit post and anxious as a mod is going over this probably thinking: ""What is this shit?"" before going to me and say: ""it ain't League affiliated dog, delete this."" Regardless, I want to set myself as an example. Of what NOT to do and how to avoid being another perma-banned statistic. 

Know when enough is enough. If your face becomes redder than a blood moon, you need to stop. Practicing self-control is THE most important thing to master outside of the game if you want to climb. You are the only person that knows yourself the most. If you get frustrated easily after one loss, stop. Take a break. Do something else to get your mind off of things. Please. I want people to realize that flaming does nothing other than hurt people. There's a fine line between being blunt and giving advice harshly and just downright flaming, giving people no good reason as to why you're doing so.  Sure there are real life exceptions like Tyler1 that seem to go against these advice. But at the end of the day, you control how your life goes. Mindset and restraint are the two most important things to climb. I've uninstalled the game already, but that doesn't mean I'll stop loving the game. I guess I'm now the Surprise Party Amumu, watching from the window and seeing how much fun people have. 

If people manage to read this far, thanks for reading this much. If anyone cares, I can answer in depth questions as to how to improve mentality or how my mind works since most people are going to think I'm crazy to expect people to listen to a loser that got 3 accounts perma'ed. I might come back and make a fourth account. Who knows, might take months, years, decades? Maybe when I forget how to play because I seem to enjoy games most when I'm learning about them.",0,1585372821,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqe0it/know_when_to_cut_your_losses_confessional_into/,leagueoflegends,1

Twice now, I've bought Hunter's Machete by accident and realized this mistake during the first wave. I backed, SOLD IT, and then went back to lane.  However, the whole game my exp was reduced even though I had more farm than my opponent. I ended up 3 levels behind my bot and support all game and 5 levels behind their mid-laner despite the fact that I had the most CS on either team.

Is this a bug or is this on purpose? If it's on purpose I don't see the reasoning. It's really harsh to punish my exp for the rest of the game for a mis-purchase.

So many OP champions Sylas, Garen, Kass, Yi every game is literally nothing to do with skill and purely because one team got more drakes and has the more op draft any fun that remained in this game has been lost. Games are so one sided and boring I genuinely cant remember the last time i had fun playing this game especially in ranked, The games are so short and one sided that players all do this infamous thing where they just say FF at like 5 min and it tilts the whole team. I know League has been a team oriented game but now its always about who has the better jungle and the most op champions. Its nothing to do with if u as an individual do ur role u need at least 3 other team members to be doing well to have a fun and normal game. That never happens sometimes I simply just wanna play the game lane phase and teamfight what not but now its jus being stomped in lane then wait around for obviously lost teamfights especially tanks are useless",1,1585369880,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqdcer/am_i_allowed_to_criticise_this_game/,leagueoflegends,1

fqd43q,jah_rastaman,"Low elo players using Taliyah, Vlad, Jayce, Ez, Asol etc","Some champions are very hard to play and there are a lot of champions that do the same work better, like Jayce, why do you want to play Jayce top if you can just pick Vayne? she has more damage and doesn't fall late game, specially when you are iron or bronze. 

You can't take the advantage enough to justify some picks, the chance of of losing the game because of your troll pick is insane, even in the Plat I never saw a good GP player or a good Jayce player to justify their pick, because Jayce for example he is abused in the professional scenario by some psychopaths like TheShy or Nuguri because they know how to harass the enemy top laner in a way the pick is worth, once you will be ahead in farm, gold and exp and you will be a problem in the splitpush, (even they are in a treat, if they lose the lane or the lane is ""even"" the game is over) but dude i'll never understand a bronze for example picking Jayce and trying to farm (because they don't know and don't will farm) behind the tower and feeding a Darius or Yorick being dived af etc.

You have two teams in the Silver 4, the first: (Jayce top, Taliyah jg, Vlad mid, Ez adc and Bardo sup) and the second: (Yorick top, Yi jg, Annie mid, MF adc and Veigar sup) which team will win? obviously if the low elo player knows to play Vlad, Jayce and Taliyah properly, they will not be Silver 4, some champions like Jayce or Taliah you can trust on me if you know to play and abuse them, you will be at least Plat 2 (they have a low winrate for a reason), if you are Bronze it means you don't know to play him and you are just trolling your team by picking them.

The only kind of champions that works in the low elo are the basic all in champions, you don't need to have skill or think,, you just need to dive your enemy and smash how much buttons you can, if you are with a DPS champion needing to know how to dodge a skill, how to use skill shot, how to harass, how to control the wave and the map, how to do a flank and play the vision or a TF, the chance you will lose the game is 100% except if the enemy team are more troll than your team.

Then, I think riot must to put some advice in the champions like: ""this champion are recommended for your current elo because of that"", cos most of the games in the low elo it is just decided by picks and troll picks, and even if you know to play some difficult champion, your team don't know how to play with this champion in the comp (I'm Azir main i know a lot about that), and this will sucks at the end.

Some say: if you are a good Vayne or Riven player you are at least diamond 2, however even not being good, Vayne and Riven can works well in the Silver elo, however some champions simply doesn't work and even when they work there is no good justification to play him.

Champions you should not play in the low elo and mid elo (below D2) if you aren't main:

Asol

Azir

Bardo

Camille

GP

Jayce

Kalista

Maokai Top (not difficult to play but playing him is pointless)

Neeko

Nidalee

Nami

Singed

Taliyah

Vlad

Zoe

Imagine you're a new player, diving into one of the world's most popular games and you see this many errors. And then you dismiss them, ""Surely this will be fixed by tomorrow, Riot is such a large company, I'm sure they have the resources to rectify this."" But no. It persists. And persists. And persists.

Sure, they might fix one or two and things seemingly get better and you assume that the others will be fixed in no time. Nope. They, too, persist and persist and persist - until it reaches the point it's the new ""norm"" you're forced to accept.

It's sad that the League experience has devolved each and every season and it's reaching all time lows the more time passes. Even better is it now spills into their other games.

Truly curious as to what goes on behind closed doors at Riot HQ...

And the second one is about bruisers how we counter that much heal i swear if i dont ban aatrox and morde the game is insta dodge everytime they go 1 vs 5 and get tons and tons of heal i even got fking morde adc and he destroied eveything cuz he wont fking die u would say know well u just need antiheal all my teamates were full mortal reminder and morelo and he steal outhealed our dmg which was atrocious the best part is that we didnt even feed them they were like that since the game begun...
So now i dont made this topic to complain as i said im looking for advice how should i fight against this cancerous meta? And especially as a bottom lane player

fqc04f,Scarlet-eyes,I want to share an embarrassing meaningless story for me that always bothers me.,"This happened in season eight, the first time I got plat elo and grew ego lol. I had a group of friends who I’ve always played inhouse 5v5 custom games with (they’re mostly diamond). I was always winning top lane with Garen/Chogath in those customs because none of them was a top lane main, so my ego grew even bigger and bigger. Few days later, they introduced a gold elo top laner who plays Yorick, and while I won the first two games, I barely ever won afterwards. He was unkillable and asserted huge pressure that my lane was lost every game. I couldn’t accept defeat due to my huge ego back then, and then he BM’d me as well, which got me worked up lol.

He started making fun of me on social media like cropping my face on a scene of someone getting beaten, sending Yorick’s picture and typing “goodnight (my name)” things like that. We then arranged a custom game on a specific date to settle things on who’s the better top laner. 

I had to put him in his place, and went 0/5 Jax because I read he counters Yorick lol. I saw it coming, nine people were hard mocking me on discord, and even more people whom I never knew. I was also getting constantly mocked on Whatsapp so I left the group, which I believe is a big mistake because I proved I am a sore loser. 

I am aware of how useless this post is, but I occasionally remember this and think about how embarrassing that was, I dealt with defeat in the most embarrassing way, and then I left the group indicating that I am an emotional kid who left over a video game. I feel like they won’t ever change their perception on me, even if I play with them again to this day.

Therefore we should nerf COVID-19 by reducing it's base damage by 2 and lethality at all lvls by 6. In addition to these new balance changes MSI is now going to be formally known as NSI as in ""No Season Invitational"".

Furthermore, in an attempt to promote social distancing, Teamfight Tactics will no longer host carousel rounds due to champs and players being within 6 feet of each other.

Upcoming changes to summoners rift include but are not limited to 
• Scuttle will no longer be able to be damaged by melee attacks, if you come within 6ft it will dash the f*ck away
• Nurse Akali automatically ends the match with +1 honors
• Ornn is banned in competitive gamemodes because he won't stop breathing on other people, same for Aurelion Sol but nobody plays him anyway because of his trash rework
•Chogath will be required to wash his hands for at least 20 seconds before eating an enemy champion
• Annie no longer carries a backpack with her due to recent school closures 

Finally, Rito Games has decided that in order to FLATTEN THE CURVE all Italian players will be qaurantined from using allchat.

That being said I really liked his kit and saw that his ulti has a (+6% of enemy hp) so I thought on-hit would be great. This is working in low elo, but I think it has great potential for all elo. So here is on-hit jungle wukong.

Core items : Bloodrazer, bork, and wits end (if they have ap if ad go deathsdance).

Items after core : Deaths dance, Steraks/Phantom dancer (steraks if you need a little more beefy-ness and the hp or phantom if you need the speed/attack speed), trinity force, and Guardian Angel. Also if you really want to you could get or black cleaver, but I think black cleaver is bad on wukong because of his Q reducing their armor.

Situational : Mortal Reminder, Deadmans, Randuins, thornmail, adaptive helm, maw of malmortious , and mercurial scimitar.

Boots : Tabi or Merc

1st tree runes : Conq as main, triumph, alacrity or tenacity, and coup de grace if you like to clean up or last stand which I recommend because you want to frontline with this build. 

2nd tree runes : either domination with sudden impact and relentless or sudden impact with ravenous.

3rd tree : Attack speed, adaptive, and either armor or mr.

fqbmxu,schneper,Solo Q is not about personal skill anymore,"Maybe its just the current tank meta, and me being an adc main. But this Season feels more like about having the right team comps, rather than personal skill. Also, team mentality seems way off (maybe its because of the current crisis? -&gt; People are at home, playing more LoL than usual and get tilted after some time?) Like 75% of my games, someone will say ""gg go next"" after being 5 min ingame. 

I can get fed early on, still manage to secure objectives. But if i have 1-2 mates who are feeding and not doing well, it just becomes impossible to carry as an adc. At this point its clear for me, no matter how well i am doing that game, i will eventually lose. What i want to say is, Solo Q feels more and more like a coinflip (do you get the right player mentality or the feeder guy/afk mate?) 

This game used to not be that team based, you still could carry on your own. But it just becomes harder and harder. I remember people saying ""hey, i got this amumu build and i win like every single game with it"".

* Be the enemy Ashe

* Get a free kill early because our Cait is GARBAGE and ran through the river instead of the safe way.

* I abandon her at level 1 because she showed she was complete garbage in that instance

* Destroy cait in lane 1v2 because she is garbage and be 5/0 early

* Still lose because I get kills in every other lane and manage to turn a guarenteed loss into a win

Imagine being that bronze ashe and still losing. ADC is the most boosted role in league.

fqbfix,DeadNames,"As someone who mained old Aatrox since his release, I think that future VGUs shouldn't bother trying to stay as faithful as possible to their original kits.","For this example, I would like to point to Pantheon.

His kit largely stayed the same. Q is a spear attack, W is a point and click stun, E is a flurry of stabs much like his old E. Of course there are some huge differences in functionality. You're not really using new Panth E for damage.

When it was announced Pantheon was getting a VGU, I was so excited. I was super pumped for the Spartan character to have a real, solidified place in the cast. 

When he came out, I played him for like 4 games and dropped him. His kit felt the same. There wasn't really anything new. 

Everyone points to the Aatrox rework as this huge colossal failure of a rework, which I think is total BS. Aatrox is a hugely popular champion, and is now one of the coolest and most fun top laners in the game. His character is super interesting, his kit feels awesome, and everyone loves him.

I think that in the future Riot shouldn't bother trying to modernize the kit of the champion they're reworking. They should create entirely new kits for these characters (without breaking their identities of course).

fqbdxr,m_btropper,Do people honestly feel that the punishment for toxicity and throwing is harsh enough?,"Just a rant because it's too exhausting playing this game with all the terrible attitudes from people. I feel like the game is designed to be really fun for 5 man team play and the state it's in right now is just trying to survive feeders and toxicity. I think most people main whatever they think can carry a game because they can't trust team mates not to throw. 

It makes the game really unpleasant and its avoidable if Riot actually punished harshly. Month bans, IP bans, take phone numbers to set up accounts, whatever it is I don't care but do something to make it actually worth playing. I love the game but I'm sure im not the only one who experiences this and has to move to other games to have some sanity away from people happy to waste each other's time. 

I might as well just afk, dodge and feed as soon as I see it's not likely gonna win and start some more accounts since everyone else does and there's really no reprocutions. 

But that's my opinion and I'm curious of other people's input.

fqb9iy,moody_P,The biggest problem Nasus has as a juggernaut is that none of his utility is tied to his role,"Nasus's power fantasy is at odds with what his kit actually provides for his team and it creates this weird divide where he's not really giving his team a reason to help him get or stay in melee, because his main contribution to the fight doesn't actually involve him being in melee; all he really needs to do to be a huge threat is drop W and E. 

If you look at what other juggernauts are like, either by what you'd considered a healthy juggernaut design or by what's objectively the most successful in high elo/pro play, they have a consistent pattern of their team utility directly tying into their power fantasy, and when they're strong, they're played the way they're intended to.

Going by what *I* consider to be healthy designs;

- Illaoi's E clearly plays into and defines her niche as a poke/pressure zoning champion. When she's strong, she still plays around this effect and both her and her team benefit from beating down the ghosts. However, she's a very unique design and doesn't apply well to the others.

- Darius's E and W provide him with his sticking potential and disruption to be able to set up for his Q and passive pop-offs. Naturally, his simple kit plays very well into this and he still exists viably as a damage threat because of it. Being a more traditional juggernaut than Illaoi, he depends on being in or close to melee range to pull it off. 

Juggernauts who succeed in pro play;

- Urgot's R sets up his main utility value as being able to chew someone up and turn them into a fear. He buys items to better enable his rushing in and fearing everyone he can and thus requires to commit to getting into melee range (and his damage range) to pull it off.

- Trundle, while not really a damage heavy champion in pro play, still benefits his team by getting into melee range where he can spam-slow and reduce AD of anyone he gets on top of. His E helps disrupt opponents and his team is clearly incentivized to get him into melee range because he has utility tied to it.

I'm sure you see the pattern. Generally, successful juggernaut designs have at least some degree of non-damage value tied to being in melee range, or very close to melee range. However, Nasus does not.

- Wither is ranged and is effectively a fire-and-forget spell. Spirit Fire is the same way while also having a sizable nuke when maxed. The only thing Nasus contributes in melee range is damage; juggernauts at the pro level don't actually show up for their damage but for their utility, and Nasus's utility is too good and *too independent* of his power fantasy to let his power fantasy be appropriately strong.

This is why, when Nasus is meta, it's never actually for his power fantasy, despite the numerous attempts Riot has made to specifically buff him around his stacks and making him stronger with less stacks (which has only made the problem worse since he becomes obnoxiously snowbally in soloQ environments while still failing at his power fantasy in better levels of play.) It's either as a Wither bot or as a very non-interactive laner with E max strategies to just stonewall top. Lastly, it makes him more frustrating to deal with, since he doesn't have any particular condition to achieve, not even the very basic and staple juggernaut condition of getting into melee range, for him to screw up your attack speed and armor; it basically just happens by default. 

If Nasus is to become a fair and strong juggernaut who also caters to his promised power fantasy of getting big stacks and becoming a carry-level threat, then he needs some of his teamplay value shifted to getting into melee range.",21,1585361467,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqb9iy/the_biggest_problem_nasus_has_as_a_juggernaut_is/,leagueoflegends,1

fqasri,RealRqti,Possible New Way To Rank Players,"League of Legends gives players LP for winning or takes LP for losing a game.  This, in my opinion, is a really stupid way to ranking players, especially in a game as sensitive as League.

&amp;#x200B;

Many players in League solo queue can play hours of ranked and still end up in the same spot and they were 10 games ago.  This is super un-rewarding and needs to be fixed.  For example, CSGO ranks players by giving out MVPs to players to make good plays in that round, and the person with the most MVPs by the end of the game has the highest chance of ranking up.  This performance bases system I think would be far more suited for League.

&amp;#x200B;

Due to League's community, everyone flames and it usually stems from some player getting mad at another player for ruining their game and making them lose LP.  But League already has a feature in the game that should be fleshed out and replace the LP system. 

&amp;#x200B;

After every game of League, you get a grade, D- to S+.  Why isn't Riot using this to rank players instead of just who wins the game?  A game can be decided by so many factors and if you get a team that plays wrong it can make it significantly harder to carry them.  Why not take players LP when they get a bad grade and give them LP when they get a good grade, regardless if the game was a win or not.",20,1585359727,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqasri/possible_new_way_to_rank_players/,leagueoflegends,1

fqanp2,Kastorium,Is it impossible to win in Low Elo unless you legit 1v9?,"This question isn’t for anyone above Platinum, as you don’t understand low elo enough to comment on it. No flame, you just don’t understand. 

I’m a S4 support/mid main. I mainly play support but I do dabble in mid for an autofill role. I usually win my lane(higher XP and farm at 10, 15 etc) all those stats check out for me, however I went 1-14 over my past 15 games. 

These happened over the course of 3 days. I’m one of those players who constantly pings things out and let’s EVERYONE know when they’re getting ganked(usually right, like 7/10 times). 

Nothing works, I got an autofill jungle every game, they don’t understand pathing or how to invade, when they can, and why they invade. 

Players also seem to not understand that everything is a tradeoff. If you do one thing that means you can’t do this thing over here. However players want to do both, so they die and lose lane.

All 14 games that I lost were over by 15 minutes. We played a few out but I knew it was over. It wasn’t even close. The one game we won was because both junglers were autofilled. The massive amount of Jungle diff in this elo is huge. You can’t do anything about it either, because I don’t play Jungle. As a Sup main, I try to help the jungle out. I try to gank and look for plays, but they’re so bad it isn’t even close. 

Honestly I’m sick of playing the game. Every game it’s the same. Enemy jungle ganks top or mid, they die. They go back to lane at a disadvantage, and since no one understands that you lost lane when you died, and you should just cut your losses and stay back, they try to “win” lane, and come back(never try to comeback with kills, just focus CS and objectives) which results in 0-2 with rift control. Then the other laners look bot. TP on top, roam on mid. Come bot lane and either kill us 4v2(because our jungle is topside farming raptors and ignored my help pings) or we have to back off tower and give plates and gold and now we’re behind. Now the game is over because they have a 3,000 gold lead, and are not gonna blow it.


Before anyone says(they can def blow that gold lead) the question is “Are they gonna blow the gold lead?” Probably not.

Now, for all the high elo players who are gonna come in and talk about how easy it is to win in low elo, yeah probably for you. But not for me, I think what people fail to realize is everyone isn’t GOOD at the game. I’m okay, I got to S4, I’ll probably get to G4(hopefully) but only if I switch roles.

So anyway, getting back to the question. What are some good 1v9 top laners or Junglers who can just blow open a game if they have a lead. Something forgiving. I’ll focus on it and learn how to play it. But it’s impossible to play without Jungle, so I’d rather go Jungle.",63,1585359243,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqanp2/is_it_impossible_to_win_in_low_elo_unless_you/,leagueoflegends,1

fqag0l,Newfypuppie,Playing ADC feels like boxing without being allowed punch back,"does it matter if the mage bot keeps over extending to get poke in lane? In general, I don't have the CC to punish that. 

It's doesn't matter if the enemy top laner over dives to try to get me and wiffs cause it still takes me 5 billions autos to kill him while he can still bash my front line in. 

Why does it not matter if the enemy team flops around and can't end when my crit build 6 items isn't even enough to take over a game when two items reduces my total damage output by 30% fucking percent not counting the damage reduction stats stats they give. 

If the enemy ap mid misses their combo on me I should naturally kill them in 4-5 aa right? No idea what that feels like because they built a zhonya's and my autos hit for 300 on their nearly 3k sized HP bar. 

What use is sustained DPS when initial burst engage combos far out damages your team's health bars. 

Why bother with aggressively pushing lane if plating is only split 50% on you and you open yourself up to get ganked by two different 2 people on map. Better to freeze at tower and just walk up when the inevtiable drag/scuttle fights happen. 

Oh but's it's fine my positioning is the issue right. That is until you get flash engaged on half a screen away by a camille and wonder why you even bothered logging in today. 

it's okay that the meta shifted towards lethality varus, MF, senna all high burst ADC's it's not indicative how sustained DPS is not viable. 

Don't worry cause out of the [top ten bot lane champs] 2 of them are supports, 3 are ap mages, and only 3 of them actually builds a core of crit items.

it's fine that literally, Gosu, saber, and tyler1 all prominent challenger level ADC mains have all role swapped in the past month fed up with the role

fqaafv,KaleMacGrath,I am in a toxic relationship with this game and I need help,"I am currently in two relationships. One is a great, perfectly healthy one with the girl I love. The other is a toxic one with League of Legends.

League has been a part of me since season 4, although I played a few matches in season 3. Since then I've tested it all; new game modes, nearly all the champions, different roles, a few main champions and many skins. I've spent roughly 300€ on the game during this 6+ years period and I am satisfied with that. I like most of the new systems, like crafting; many game modes, like ARAM, URF and OFA; and most of the champs Riot has published during the years. It all seems too good to be true - and it is.

For you see, during these years, I've played countless games with my former school friends (whom are a great bunch all in all), many solo ranked games, many ARAMs and tested many fun champions. I still have major problems with the game.

Firstly, it's addicting. I've pretty much played the game at least once a day for at least 75 months straight. There have of course been countless days when this has not been possible, but seeing that I've many times played over 10 games a day more than compensates for that. You just always want to play more and try to get better.

Second (and this one ties to the first one) the matches take up a lot of time which I can't get back. One ranked can be anything from 15-60mins, sometimes more and rarely less (remakes don't count, although that process takes roughly 10mins with the lobby). Now, wol.gg tells me I've wasted 39,441 minutes on the game at the time of writing this text, roughly 27 days. That's *a month*. Now most of you have probably racked up more time on the game. That's fine, but I feel like I'm skipping my youth here, playing a game.

Third, the community. Whenever I play a ranked, I have toxicity on either side. When we're losing, someone has to flame, int, AFK (the intentional variant) and whatnot. When we're winning, the same happens on the other team. Rarely I play a game where everyone in the game is humble. Competitive BS is ok, but verbal abuse is not. I know I've done it, and you've probably done it too at least once. It's OK if you've moved on from that mindset.

Lastly, the champions. I play everything, but nothing sticks with me. IDK why that is, but I want to have a main. I've played a ton of Katarina, Sivir, Lucian, Malphite, Amumu, Ahri etc. but nothing interests me anymore enough to spam games like a madman. I want your suggestions.

So, fellow Redditors, my questions for you are;

What can I do to make my time feel less wasted?
What champs should I learn to play?
What can I do to rank up to at least my goal, which has always been Plat/Dia?

Have a nice day and wash your hands!",26,1585357884,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fqaafv/i_am_in_a_toxic_relationship_with_this_game_and_i/,leagueoflegends,1

fq9y0h,deid829,MAGE RANT (buff mr items!),"I’ve played the game consistently for 3 years now and have started to realize a trend...
With every new patch Riot throws tiny buffs into mages. Nothing visible, but there have been consistent buffs within mages over these last few patches. It’s a very slow power creeping process.I play mid and top lane. Top lane bruisers or mid lane ad-assassins. I’ve come to a realization...
Why play ad champs in any role besides adc or jungle?
You play an ad assassin, you get early pressure and kills off roams, but that itself is not enough. You have champs like cassiopeia, kassadin, ryze, anivia, which are all basically “f**k you melee” champs with supposed “weak” early games just absolutely dominating in mid and top lane at ALL stages of the game. Picking zed, yasuo, darius, talon, etc. is just TROLL PICKING. 
Just look at the cost efficiency of mage items. Not one item is less than 130% cost efficiency. Banshees veil which is the “bad mage item” gives more MR than ANY MR ITEM IN THE GAME.
Either nerf mage damage, items, or BUFF MR ITEMS. Even tanks are getting destroyed by mages, and I believe it’s time for the balancing team to realize that it’s not fun to build up a huge lead as any champ (be it ranged adc, assasin, bruiser, tank) and be instagibbed by a losing syndra, ekko, viktor, annie. Additionally, mages lack skill in playing, and for them to be rewarded with such amazing stats is an outrage. Every game against a mage is an uphill battle, and you’re trolling your team if you pick AD into mages.

I understand that a lot of mage players would find this wrong, but understand these are real issues, and the whole community has shown concern over the past few years.

When I reinstalled it from the riot website when I click install in the little launcher it says riot service already running. I look at task manager and nothing riot related is running. I have found a riotgames folder in my C: drive and tried deleting it with administrator and in the window it said try again because you aren't using administrator powers. I tried using the hextech tool to no avail since its not downloaded and the League of Legends.exe in that folder was getting an error when I tried to use it with hextech tool. I also looked in my %appdata% for any league folder and there was nothing. I have tried changing my administrative rights to be able to delete the folder and it does not work. Now I cannot even open the folder it keeps saying access is denied and I have also tried setting up a new User to see if it would let me download it there but it says another riot process is running and I don't know what to do. Ive tried deleting the file through command line aswell. To no avail with rd/s. Could it be because of my antivirus software or firewall.

fq98ly,blazindamon,Let us give Caitlyn her identity back,"With 10.2 shipping, the Caitlyn bug-fixes also removed a key mechanic and also a big part of her identity for dedicated players like myself. I am talking about the ability to activate head-shots from multiple W's or E instantly after one another, rather than having to wait her auto attack cool-down, like on the live version. The patch reads the following:

&gt;Caitlyn no longer gets bonus Headshots by inputting the attack-move command near the target while they are trapped and netted simultaneously

&gt;Caitlyn can no longer use attack-move to attack trapped or netted targets while she is crowd controlled.

In case you do not understand what these mean, here's [a video of xfsn_saber explaining what exactly isn't possible anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCAHSeDTxSU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=94) and for reference, if you haven't seen it before, [here is an example of the old combo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGjYmGAKHzU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=168)
After plenty of time to reflect on the changes and giving the idea that it was a broken mechanic a fair thought, it seems to me that all that changed with it is lower Caitlyn's skill ceiling. Adding a delay to being able to utilize ones passive of the magnitude of the attack speed does not mean it scales with attack speed, it means its unreasonably clunky. In a rather comedic way, according to Phreak's patch rundown, it is more beneficial to build damage rather than attack speed on her, as is reflected by the current builds surfacing in solo queue. As someone who used to love Caitlyn because of the way I could differentiate myself from other players simply by mechanics, I dropped her up until recently. Every time I trap an enemy, it feels like my hands are tied behind my back.

The mechanic being removed and labeled as a bugfix really made me think about other unintended mechanics in the game. Alright, if Cait has to wait her auto attack cooldown, why is Yasuo allowed to transfer the damage of his E-Q from a minion to a priority target with the click of a button? Why is Riven allowed to weave in an extra auto attack in between each Q she casts? Are those champions balanced with these mechanics in mind? I am doubtful, but lets give it the benefit of the doubt. In that case, why was the ""bug fixed"" instead of the numbers being adjusted, resulting in turning Caitlyn into a different champion for the passionate 1% of her players? Honestly, it feels like they added the changes as an easy way of fixing the machine gun part of the combo, which I do agree that it should not have been in the game. Here's an example of the combo, [including the machine gun part.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynkuNFP5pKA)

I made this post as a call to the community to please promote skill expression in the game and balancing with it in mind.

Thank you for reading this.

Sincerely,

a Caitlyn player.

First thing I'd like to mention is that beforehand, if I was drunk or stoned (or probably both) I always had my ""safe picks"" ie: teemo, yi, tryndamere, darius etc. However being a month or so back into it after a 2 year hiatus I have to say that things are EXTREMELY balanced compared to when I left.

fq8uud,yarf13,"Any support mains want to duo this weekend? Also, welcome to any advice.","Currently silver 2 in NA. Hoping to spam queues until gold this weekend. Here's some detailed information about my general gameplay to shed light on how we might vibe or not. 

I main Ezreal 90% of my games. Ezreal has a specific playstyle. Generally, it's a poke and farm lane until I have at least sheen. A good spike is when I have pickaxe and sheen (but usually get tear before pickaxe). Additionally, I personally take the lethal tempo rune which means short trades while the rune is activated then backing up to farm. I'm generally way better at fighting than laning. But those fights don't mean anything without items. So farm is key.

Since it is silver elo there's an off chance we just kill them consistently in lane with no jungle pressure, but if it's not, the ideal is to get to mid game with items from safe farming. 

All that being said, this strategy is generally good for any support, but if you play a champ like Nautilus or Leona or blitzcrank I would guess we kill them in lane every engage. It's more the healers/mages I can't all in with very effectively. 

Other than that, I like grouping for objectives, helping jungle secure neutrals, teamfighting etc. 

Feel free to message me to chat so I can learn your playstyle and we can form a strategy.",1,1585352874,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fq8uud/any_support_mains_want_to_duo_this_weekend_also/,leagueoflegends,1

The problem is, Kass is so strong, yet easy to play at the same time, vs every other midlane champion that every single draft has to revolve around him if not banned.

You cannot pick anything that might possibly have a bad kass matchup blind, and even get forced into taking kass just to avoid enemy team getting it.

His win rate being kept in check by then you losing to Talon or lucian etc doesn't make his state any more healthy.

Every mid select if kass isnt banned goes

1. Pick kass if not banned, enemy then takes an AD counter, or they troll pick a mage and lose

2. Pick your normal ap mid, lose to kass

very fun, delete this champion",11,1585351238,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fq8cq2/kassadin_being_overpowered_really_screws_up_any/,leagueoflegends,1

fq6hne,FinaglingFox,I forgot the log in details for the gmail associated with my account. Now what?,"I made a second account that I leveled to 30 about 3 or 4  years ago  and wanted to use this account to play together with two friends starting out. I can log in with it and play with it fine.

However, I made the e-mail associated with the account specifically for this account and don't remember the password for it.  I tried to reclaim the log in details via google with no success.

Are there any drawbacks to me not being able to log in to this mail account?

Is there anyone who has had a similar issue or knows how to maybe solve this?",2,1585345312,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/fq6hne/i_forgot_the_log_in_details_for_the_gmail/,leagueoflegends,1
