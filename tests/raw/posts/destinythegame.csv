fsog58,gurupaste,How Would You Guys Feel About Having the Option to Disable Bullet Magnetism on PC?,"It's very unlikely for a change like this to be implemented in D2 since it seems to be so engrained into the stats of guns, but let's say for D3 we could turn off bullet magnetism? I find that it's detrimental to my aim in other games if I play Destiny for long a period of time, and I always try to keep my aim consistent with every fps. D2 sorta throws all that out the window when I hit shots that shouldn't have hit, and get hit by shots I should have avoided. I know this game isn't exactly competitive and has a huge casual base that mainly plays PvE content. For me, headshots don't feel as rewarding in other games because of how forgiving it is, and it's not exactly hard to shoot AI. I'm just asking for the option to toggle it on/off, what are your thoughts on this request? Is it something that Bungie would even prioritize when they have more important things to work on? This would probably affect the process Bungie has with creating guns and would not be worth the cost, but I'm just throwing this idea out there. I remember this topic coming up during the D2 beta and wanted to bring it up again.",7,1585699151,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsog58/how_would_you_guys_feel_about_having_the_option/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsoe7k,ghostyeaty,Mountaintop/Recluse easy,"I just got both of these solos and it really wasn't too hard so if you want to get these I would suggest trying now. Also I'm not very good at PVP, maybe all the more advanced PVP players are in trials right now so it makes comp much easier.

Recluse: Getting fabled is the hardest part, I easily did this just by queuing for the solo comp playlist. My loadout was thorn with badlands as my secondary and hammerhead for my heavy weapon. For subclass, I used top tree Nightstalker and paired it with the exotic The Dragons Shadow. This allowed for invisibility and reloading my weapons when I dodged along with its exotic perk. Comp itself wasn't too hard and matching worked most the time only matching in a 2v3 once.

Mountaintop: For this I was already fabled and needed the grenade launcher kills and medals. I did this easily by joining mayhem and just trying to get heavy as fast as I could. pair this with any subclass that either protects you or makes it easier to get kills and the grenade launcher kills should come easily. For weapons I used Orewings Maul and any grenade launcher with proximity grenades.

I hope this helps anyone that needs it",11,1585698960,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsoe7k/mountaintoprecluse_easy/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsnveg,Bladimus,What if there was a passage for NEVER having gone flawless in Trials?,"Hear me out! 

If you've never gone flawless in Trials, say Saint-14 would have a passage available to you that would match you against others that have also purchased the same passage and only that passage would be allowed entry into the game. It would still be challenging, would it not? Going against other guardians with the same skill level just to make it to the lighthouse one time before jumping into ""sweaty try-hard"" trials? Once you finally achieve that feeling of arriving at the lighthouse, your option to purchase that particular passage would no longer be available. I would say it would be account based so you could do it on one character and that's it.

In this mode, Bungie could make it so you wouldn't get rewarded trials tokens or any other rewards for hitting 3 and 5 wins, just the lighthouse reward for that week. Then there wouldn't be any reason to ""farm"" this ""matchmaking mode"", just get your flawless run and become sweaty with the rest of them - BECOME UNSTOPPABLE!

Heck, call it Trials Training Wheels or Trials of Kinderguardians if you want - doesn't matter - I think this would give the less talented pvp players an opportunity to feel what it is like to have an achievement like this and it would give them something to chase, a carrot on a stick if you will.

Each week there would be less and less ""experienced"" players in the matchmaking pool, essentially taking it down to a lower pvp skill level BUT it would still be competitive because everyone would roughly be around the same skill level. Making it to the lighthouse would still feel like a huge accomplishment. 

Thoughts? I know Bungie wants this to be an elite experience for the tried and true. The best of the best of the bunch, sir. With honors. But do you see the harm in letting the ""casuals"" experience it one time so we know what it feels like? Maybe it would encourage more people to jump into ""sweaty"" trials after they've gotten a good fireteam together and made it to the ""Kinderguardian"" Lighthouse? 

TLDR: make a matchmaking mode in Trials Of Osiris for people who have never gone flawless. The only reward would be for going flawless so there isn't a way to ""farm"" anyone for rewards.",29,1585697102,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsnveg/what_if_there_was_a_passage_for_never_having_gone/,DestinyTheGame,2

fsnj3y,firedelsol,Trials is horrible . But also its not,"The vast majority of us can agree that trials has a lot of issues ; from underwhelming loot , to top tier players farming lower ranks for tokens.  Every single one of us could right paragraphs on other issues within trials and the game in general at the moment . With all that said , I had an epiphany today :

Through adversity , we unit . 

To elaborate: i am a mid level player at best , but so are most of the people i match with using LFGs for trials . That means we are all around the same skill level, and have to truly work as a team to stand a chance against better players . The past few weeks , i have added at least a dozen if not more friends to my play roster , and I even finally got into a decent clan . This wouldnt have happened if I wasnt getting crushed next to my fellow guardians. 

Some of my best gaming moments have come from 1v3s against a stack of unbrokens . Also, I have never been so hyped than when i see my fellow guardians work their asses off to eek out a victory that nobody expected .

On top of this, we also get to take pleasure in bragging about our sommoner or astral horizon rolls . We all sit there holding our breath turning in our tokens , normally only be let down . But the absolute hype that surrounds the "" yo dude, inspect me right now"" , normally followed by the "" you SOB"" . It's fun.

fsmzdf,Megajoshuaw,The Problem With Seasonal Mods Is That They Are Not Explained In-Game,"Besides the initial mods for GoS and nightmare hunts, mods have been endlessly confusing for the last 2 seasons. In reality they are quite simple, kill with seraph to spawn orb, and activate charged with light to get buff, but this is never explained at all in game and it leaves players hopelessly confused unless they watch a Aztecross or Ehroar video.

Personally for me, I am in the mix between casual and hardcore, I have 1500 hours since d1 and didn’t really delve deep in the game until Forsaken. But now I am at a loss since the mod system is just such a mess. There’s no reason that mod systems should be harder to understand than all the raid mechanics in the game. But here we are.

*Charged With Light*

The confusion of what triggers what for the Charged With Light is just so confusing. When you go in, you see all of these mods but have no sense of what does what because you are already preoccupied with the bounty flush. Maybe that’s another issue, you don’t feel like there is time to experiment because the gane is constantly pressuring you into the endless bounty grind for levels in the pass. But maybe if I sat down for an hour and tested each mod, I’d find one that suited me, but it just doesn’t feel worth it. Because we don’t understand it. I have never seen these mods explained once in-game. Also, many of these mods are just straight-up bad and it makes it even harder to find the value in spending an hour decrypting all of these mods.

*Seraph Mods*

Now Seraph Mods are good, I’ve seen all of the Sweatcicle and Mtashed videos on builds and I have become interested, but just like so much else that is third party, its something that should have been explained in game. 

That’s all I had to say.",47,1585694062,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsmzdf/the_problem_with_seasonal_mods_is_that_they_are/,DestinyTheGame,2

fsmueq,ironkev,New Exotic Hand Cannon and Lore idea,"Now I know most of you who aren't Hunters are tired of Exotic Hand Cannons, but please bear with me. I have long been think about Prince Uldren taking up the Hunter Vanguard position as per the terms of Cayde's Dare. I have thought even more about how he would be received at the Tower when he finally decides to come home. That's when I thought of the Crow's Eye (name is still being workshopped). A hand cannon as black as a crow's feathers, a talon-like blade at the end of the handle (D1 veterans, imagine Hawkmoon's handle), and a depiction of a crow in flight on the barrel. As for its unique perks, first is Crow's Eye, which is basically an enhanced version of Third Eye. Gives you an enhanced radar while aiming down sight. The second perk is still being workshopped as well, and I am open to any suggestions. 

Now as for the Lore aspect, WE commission Banshee to make this weapon in preparation of Uldren's eventual arrival. When he finally does arrive at the Tower and reveals himself, naturally there will be guns drawn on him by Ikora and Zavala,  possibly Amanda Holliday too. As there is confusion and tension going around the courtyard, our Guardian walks up to Uldren with the Ace of Spades drawn and pointed at him. We then tell him it's about damn time he showed up, as there is still unfinished business between us. And then we raise our voice loud enough for all to hear. ""In accordance of Cayde-6's Vanguard Dare, Uldren Sov, as the one who killed Cayde, you are hearby named the Hunter Vanguard. Lead us well, Hunter."" We the bring out the Crow's Eye and hand it to him. As for what happens next that's up to Bungie.

fsmon9,erution_,I Miss Bright Dust.,"So I know a lot of people have been talking about this but i still want to say something.  
Way back in solstice of heroes 2019 I had a lot of bright dust and could buy whatever I wanted whenever I wanted. I could keep my bright dust count at around 20,000 to 25,000 by just leveling up and getting bright engrams. I thought that getting bright dust from bounties would be better but it isn't in my opinion. My bright dust count is now constantly at around 1000-3000 and there's a lot of really cool stuff i want to buy for bright dust, since I don't have a job and cant get silver. Destiny 2 is my favorite game, and whenever I have free time I play it, but no matter how much i play and how many bounties I do I only ever have barely enough bright dust to buy the eververse armor. I just think that if Bungie should make it to where you can get bright dust from dismantling item that dropped from engrams. I do not think they should make items in the collections cost bright dust, but i think if we could dismantle items that came directly from bright engrams that would make a huge difference.",25,1585693102,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsmon9/i_miss_bright_dust/,DestinyTheGame,0

The Artifact does not level up retroactively

So I have 83 level of experience, and nothing to show for it except for some shitty Luminous Engrams that gave me the same shader 3 times

fsmeap,d0cv,What is the god-tier PVE loadout?,"D1 player here, put nearly 3500 hours into the game. Planning to go back to D2 with my friends in around a month or so. In D1 the raid setups were very straight forward: a primary with firefly/outlaw or both, Black Spindle and a heavy or Sleeper Simulant and any sniper. For Oryx/Totems people used Touch of Malice. Titans -&gt; weapons of light, hunters -&gt; nightstalkers, warlocks -&gt; self-res.

It was always kinda obvious just by looking at the loadout if the player knows what he's doing. Is Destiny 2 the same or not? I was looking at a few Datto guides and seems like shotguns are a lot more useful in raids than they were before, there is a lot more close combat encounters than there were in D1, no one used a shotgun in D1 unless they used sleeper and even then that was super rare, it was almost a kick out of the fireteam worthy offense.

Also: do older raids drop high light level loot? In D1 that wasn't the case until they brought back all the raids in Year 3. ",43,1585692197,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsmeap/what_is_the_godtier_pve_loadout/,DestinyTheGame,0

I have completed the sparrow chest encounter 20+ times and I have yet to receive a single piece of fallen mod and there are 4 in total. Fallen mods will be soon forgotten unless it's made available through other avenues , because the seasonal mods and other mods easily outshine fallen mods (since fallen encounters are very few and you really don't need it to make fallen fights easier). It's simply not worth the fight with rng at this current state to acquire them, I genuinely think it can be fun in gambit and other fallen related activities.

fslazy,Saint_Augustus,Why isn't the community mad about Raid loot gates?,"There are a lot of posts from people upset about Trials. From what I gather, its ""too hard to get loot"" or its ""too sweaty and not fun to play teams WAY better than me"". Now, I agree the incentive system needs some fixing, but there IS a bounty system that still provides access to loot without the need for winning much at all, its just time gated. And it IS a game mode specifically made for the sweaty PvP crowd. So I'm a little confused about the negative reaction here.  

I mean, there isn't even a way to earn Raid tokens at all. I can't repeat the first encounter of a Raid over and over and then turn in bounties for a chance at Raid gear and weapons. I'm FORCED to learn the mechanics. If I feel like its ""too hard"" or ""too much work"" there isn't an easy path for me to get all the good stuff. Its an even higher loot gate than Trials is, yet, no one seems to be mad about that. Why the double standard?

fskt5q,dark1859,"A reminder bungie for next season, boss stomps to keep guardians away is just lazy game design, and not the genius ""balancing"" mechanic against guardians you think it is.","look i'll let you in on a secret bungie seeing as you haven't figured it out yet, do you want to know one of the major reasons why most players use snipers in raids and strikes? you're probably thinking ""oh easy, snipers are the safest special weapon type and players prefer to shoot their targets from a safe distance"" and yes this is true, but do you know why this is especially true?

Well i'll tell you, it's because we CAN'T get close without risking near instant death either from physics or mechanics. The only weapon type that allows us to even remotely get close for 99% of raid and boss encounters are swords, which only allow us to get close because we can arrest our forward momentum by expending a light or heavy slash, or by blocking at the perfect moment to absorb most of the blow. and even then you still have a 30% chance of either being instantly murder with a sword by stomps/mechanics if your swing or block is timed just off sending you still sailing into the abyss.

So, instead of using a lazy ""off of me button"" that encouraging using weapons that keep you at a safe distance, look into these instead;

1. rework all existing stomps so they only damage don't push, it really is a sad fact that i'd say the majority of my and my friends stomp related deaths are usually from flying into stuff AND limit the stomp to only affect the ground, forcing players at point blank to have to move outward or upward to avoid taking damage, this would allow you to keep the lazy ""get off of me"" button for bosses while encouraging players to get close and use CQB weapons as swords and shotguns like 4th horseman have insane dps potential but only at very close range.
2. for bosses like calus that you have to stand in position X to do damage, allow swords and shotguns and smgs to carry a buff with them that lets you get close to the boss to damage them so we can actually ""play our way"" in raids (note exclude agros from this as it's honestly impossible to hit him up close due to the fact he floats over a void) 
3. leave bosses without stomps like riven the way they are, they've got a mechanical nightmare behind them that usually prevents attempted melee anyways.
4. for all future bosses on nightfalls' higher difficulties or even activities like reckoning or menagerie, simply add a rotating damage ""ring"" for example for say 1 minuet a boss cant stomp and will only  focus on ranged attacks, but after that minuet will become more resistant to attacks within a certain distance (5-6m i'm thinking as that's generally sword shotty smg range) but weaker to longer range attacks (such as pulse, autos, sidearms etc), then after another minuet swaps to long ranges taking more damage from DMR style weapons and snipers, before returning to CQB after 3 minuets.  This would encourage smart play over meta play, and with either the removal of or nerfage of instant death stomps would encourage players to experiment, maybe drop that recluse for a sole survivor because you can melt a boss faster with not everyone running recluse, or maybe pick up a sword and embrace your inner Templar while your team members use equally diversified loadouts.

there are probably dozens more solutions and suggestions on what bungie could do instead of boss stomps but, as bungie does often take the path of least ~~work~~ resistance this feels like somewhere to at least start.",4,1585687139,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fskt5q/a_reminder_bungie_for_next_season_boss_stomps_to/,DestinyTheGame,0

fskle4,OnJah0_o,Since Bungie isnt throwing Raid Lairs out every season I wonder if some those resources can be put into Heroic/Prestige modes for current Raids and Raid Lairs past Y1.,"Title.

We havent got a new Raid or Raid Lair since Shadowkeep and Im ok with that as long as the next raid is fleshed out  and is around Garden of Salvation or Wraith of the Machine size. Hell if possible, King's Fall or Last Wish would be great too. But it needs to be fun and engaging. 

All that aside, what if each of the raids/raid lairs past Y1 got Heroic mode every season in substitute for a whole new small raid lair. 

Say Season of Dawn dropped and we got Last Wish Heroic. And the Heroic mode included these things. 

Last Wish will be used for this example:

- Slightly Altered Mechanics for each encounter
- All Raid Weapons had Taken Spec as a extra **Intrinsic Perk**
- All Raid Armor had one of the raid mods as a extra **Intrinsic Perk** 
  - Taken Repurposing, Taken Armaments, etc.
- Pinnacle Gear Rewards
- New Raid Shader
- New Raid Armor or Ornament at the least
- Slight increase in the drop chance of Raid Exotic
- Hawthorne raid challenges are no longer bounties but are now on rotation every week like Garden of Salvation
- If time and resources permit, Missing raid weapon types added to the pool 
  - Last Wish Sidearm, Sword, Machine Gun, and Linear Fusion Rifle.

This would go a long way I thinks and would help satisfy raid drought for a bit.",23,1585686454,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fskle4/since_bungie_isnt_throwing_raid_lairs_out_every/,DestinyTheGame,4

fskhum,imakesubsreal,Warden of Nothing is honestly one of the best strikes in the game and its bossfight is underrated,"Most of the strikes are pretty straight forward, go to place, there is pile of enemies, move to next place, there is pile of enemies.

Of course this strike by that definition is no different, but there is something about it that makes it unique. For one, you have 2 factions instead of the main 1. 

Additionally, this strike has more than just 1 big boss. It actually has 3 bosses, and all of them are from different factions. You have big vex who has the trains in the environment aspect to it. You have the cabal boss with dismantle mines yes, and you have the fallen boss (who is actually a vehicle but it doesn't matter).

The thing about the bossfight however is people tend to absolutely just delete the boss before his actual fight can begin. I don't even recall when I had to deal with his eye of fire mechanic which is actually pretty unique considering 99% of boss mechanics in this game are ""stand on plate"" while this is ""seek shelter"" (broodhold boss counts too but it's not necessary and you can still survive). 

Additionally the boss spawns more bosses, naming who they are making the mini Overmind and red legion bosses sound cooler. When instead of it's you vs the Warden, it's you vs the warden and vex and red legion vs the vex. It's super cool.

Also did I mention this is the ONLY STRIKE BOSS who ever talks? (xol doesn't talk in his strike). Add that to the small list of bosses in general that don't talk, because the only other are Calus and Riven in D2 (maybe Sedia but that comes at the end after she's not a boss).

Some of you may argue there is the corrupted strike, but my point was this strike is underrated, and people seem to like the Corrupted strike a lot anyway.",390,1585686156,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fskhum/warden_of_nothing_is_honestly_one_of_the_best/,DestinyTheGame,18

fsjzmn,Margallagher,Modding advice for returning players?,"I'm effectively a new player since so much has changed from when I last played. Over the past week, I grinded my characters up to 970-980 light. Now I am realizing that the key to end-game builds is armor and weapon mods. However, I can't for the life of me find a guide online that doesn't seem months-outdated.

I generally understand how to build synergy, but where do I actually build/farm the mods themselves?

I left destiny because I missed the amazing and powerful builds you could make in Destiny 1 (i.e. my blade dancer that could be constantly invisible or nova-bomber). Mods have me excited because, with effort, it seems like crazy synergy is achievable again.

As a casual destiny player, (having all pinnacles except NF) I would like to say that as of now, Trials sucks. 

I didn't play D1 trials. Wasn't there for it. My friends knew this, and told me all about it. (btw, this is all opinion from what was probably the worst week, the astral horizon shotgun week) And when I saw the trailer for trials on Destiny's YT, I was sure I would grind, and grind, and grind, and I am sort of happy to announce, I am putting away the revoker and hard light, and am giving up. After getting stomped on by 1000s, I have stopped. I'm not doing it. It is so terrible to have a nice team that I play survival with all the time and we do well, take that into trials, and get obliterated by a team that's gone flawless 2,457 times and is currently farming their 234th Astral and 23rd bounty. Since bungie has said that for the title, you can't do it across **multiple seasons**, I am assuming that they will put it in multiple times, and I will tell New Light players about the terrible time I had in it, hoping they don't have the same experience as me.

However, SBMM getting added to COMP allowed me to practice and grind to reach legend on my own in freelance last season. It was a great challenge and I enjoyed it. To my knowledge people who had reached legend before SBMM are still capable of reaching legend with SBMM.

Why won't that still work for trials?  SBMM for Trials makes reaching the lighthouse possible for more players, while still making it challenging for all.

This is especially important this season when there is little to no new PVE content.

For the record. I got 7 wins first week, and 5 wins the second and 3rd week. So im able to get some gear and good weapons.

EDIT 2: Of course you people who have not had any trouble making it to the lighthouse don't want it to change. Obvious positions are obvious. SBMM made COMP sweaty'er for good players and possible for lower players. How could that be bad, doesn't everyone want to get better?

fsj0t5,Mando_The_Moronic,Improving the Trials of Osiris loot system,"Trials is starting to go spiraling down again. One of the main reasons being that it’s just not very rewarding. If the loot system were to be improved, I can guarantee you that people could enjoy Trials a bit more and feel a little more motivated to keep playing. Here is a list I made of things that could improve the Trials loot system. Some ideas I came up with, others I’ve seen shared among other people. 

1) Get rid of the token system. No more tokens in Trials please.

2) As response to the removal of tokens, the bounties and their loot need to be changed. There are two options I thought up for this one

-Option 1) Have 4 weekly bounties only, with each bounty offering a random Trials weapon or armor piece.

-Option2) Have the Bounties like they are set up right now, but have one weekly give a weapon and another give an armor piece, with daily and repeatable bounties rewarding xp.

3) Allow loot to drop at the end of a winning match. It can be a 1/10 wins chance, but it’ll still be enough motivation for most people to keep going.

4) Keep the card the way it is. Have each milestone on a card (3 wins, 5 wins, 7 wins, Flawless) guarantee a certain item of a powerful quality. 

5) For Flawless runs, the glows for armor and weapons can stay. However, for the weapons earned from going flawless, give them an alternate perk to choose from. Probably even throw in different perk combinations and different stats (ie a normal scout rifle has high range and low stability and can roll with no distractions, but an adept scout rifle can have high stability and low range and can roll with boxed breathing).

That’s about all I can think of right now. If anyone would like to give some of their own ideas, I’ll gladly put it up in the post.

1. There is no ""Play as you want"" find the meta and play it. atm it's hard light. get that and you are halfway to 5500/flawless already.
2. T-bag every kill, the angrier you make the enemy the more mistakes they make. emote spam also good.
3. Is something bugged or can be exploited? you use that shit.
4. Oh, if you don't have hard light, fear not! there are many like it, Jötunn for instance. just get on Reddit and follow the salt.
5. Grind for the godrolls of the current meta, Spare rations and Mindbenders etc. then become one of the indistinguishable perfect replicas of every other player of your class.
6. Bungie will only fix exploits that hurt them, use them while you can, a good example is the stuff that could be pulled out of collections for infinite shards pre shadowkeep. very good for throwing 2000 shards at Rahool for that one roll you wanted. 
7. I'm not kidding, this game will fuck your standards faster than you can lower them.
8. If you play Titan your name has to be xX(some name)69Xx ((i main Titan dont @ me))
9. There are a few youtubers who decide the meta, they are henceforth known as the council and when they release a video you have to get the exact roll they are talking about. no other weapons/armor are allowed to be experimented with.

fsiqnc,I_fell_on_a_dog,Which Seal should I grind for?,"Basically title. I’m trying to decide which seal to grind for. I’m torn between Dredgen and Wayfarer.

Dredgen is basically complete except that I’ve NEVER reset my infamy. All I need are the ghost shell, and light versus light triumph. This week is the double/triple infamy, but as a solo player, I feel this might be a crazy grind.

The next thought was Wayfarer. I’m nearly done with all triumphs, but on the collections, I am at 4/39 for curse of Osiris. With this being the hardest one, will it take longer to gather all of this than it would just grinding gambit?

I can finally get my Unbroken seal, but not until next season starts since I’ve got my 2nd legend this season. So I want something to grind for until then.

fsiq0v,Mugsy_Balone_,Quickdraw on High Impact Shottys and Backup Plan on High Impact Fusions,"Ok, let me get to the point, what is the difference between a Mindbenders with quickdraw and an Erentil with Backup Plan (before nerf)? Yes the fusion can reach further but it still has that RnG factor with spread of bolts like a shotgun with pellets etc. Imo, the back up plan nerf was too harsh with the damage removal, maybe just nerf the quick pull out time (no pun intended haha) but keep the reduced charge time or increase charge time by 50 but keep the pull out time.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I haven't explained the shotgun as much. Quickdraw on a high impact shotgun is the same as Back Up Plan on a high impact fusion because they allow you to switch to that weapon super fast in scenarios where you have another weapon out and you need your shotty/fusion (hence back up plan for fusions). Now tell me, how is a pea shooter Erentil going to be your backup plan if it can't even fucking kill an unshielded guardian reliably 100% of the time.

Also, remember that both of these weapons can reliably one tap in their respective ranges so the damage nerf to back up plan is unfair in the sense that it decreases damgage by that much.

Buff back up plan so fusions can compete against this crazy auto rifle meta we live in today.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of potential fixes for back up plan, I would be happy to see the old back up plan but increased bolt spread or decreased range. I would be happy with a high risk, high reward version.

&amp;#x200B;

fsic0e,harbinger1945,"Bungie´s idea of ""you have to be there moments"" is just flat-out wrong","I was there when we made portal to defeat undying mind over and over. And no it wasn´t a memorable event by any strech.

I was there when we defeat all three psions combined. Yes the boss fight was something nobody really expected - only because you set the bar so low in previous season.

The idea of you had to be there moments come from activities like whisper of the worm, laser tag weekend or 24:02 meme, or age of triumhs.

Some of these things happened naturally, some of them didn´t. Your idea of ""you had to be there"" moments is just wrong bungie.

I don´t care about almighty crashing down, because I already know that it will not happen.

You can force these moments - as it happened with whisper or outbreak perfected(or prime effectively speaking), but artifically forcing your playerbase into something they don´t want to do, just because you think it´s that ""moment"" just doesn ´t work.

Let me repeat myself: I don´t care about almighty because at this point in time its absolutely clear that we will remove this threat from the world eventually - and I don´t care how.

You know why moments like outbreak prime/perfected/whisper missions resonated so strongly within community ? Because it took effort. It wasn´t explained by anyone but the community, and when the reward came from the mission it was absolutely worth it.

Bastion was a great example of it(the gun is phenomenal in pvp) - but you fucked it up in PR department.

Now what I'm getting at is that Sanctum of Bones is going to be a Legendary Lost Sector, and do we all remember what faction is in that Lost Sector??  Answer is Taken!

Since LLS always featured champion variants, we might actually get a surprise addition of Taken Champions being debuted.This theory can either surprise you or give you dread, as we know how much we hate Taken in general but their Champion Variants, and also perhaps they'll feature all 3 types too?! This could get wild, especially for our Solo players.

But of course this may not be true since they can just change it up to cabal (Like a version of the WANTED Bounty where Cabal be there and a few Taken).  If it does become that way, then this LS would be the first major makeover out of all the LLS we have ever witnessed and thinking that, it has me believe it more that Taken would still be there and Taken Champs might actually be a thing.

fsi7cr,James2603,Bungie tried to fix an issue with Trials of the Nine with two different solutions and it's causing a problem.,"Back in season two of Trials of the Nine you could acquire the new weapons on day 1 winning (I think) a single match once you unlocked the first emissary. All you had to do was hand in a bunch of stockpiled tokens and you never had to play again decimating the population.

To solve this problem when the Messenger and the Jewel inevitably get released next season? They make it so that you have to unlock loot to get another roll from a St.14 engram but they also made it so your tokens disappear at the end of every week stopping us stockpiling to get good rolls on these guns on week 1. The combination of those two things is that while the loot pool is small everyone is, as you probably know, resetting cards to farm tokens while the loot pool is small; killing the Trials population prematurely.

Frankly the need to unlock loot in order to acquire them from engrams is pointless; the token solution is all that was needed. All Bungie have done is create this barrier to entry for acquiring loot. Remove this barrier and trials becomes for appealing to the more casual playerbase.

Making this change won't solve the token farm on easier matches and while I'm here I might as well throw in my two cents for a solution; a Valor/Infamy type rank up system. End-game loot at the max rank and exponentially more points awarded based on the number of wins on your card. Trials loot will drop on rank-ups giving players an incentive to get to the end of their card. Players that typically have less success in trials will still make progress and get loot for losing.

Flawless would grant fast and efficient loot and playing in the playlist will get you slower but very real rewards.",4,1585679014,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsi7cr/bungie_tried_to_fix_an_issue_with_trials_of_the/,DestinyTheGame,5

fshxoy,BlazingMuffinz,My version of Cabal Stomp (link below),"Hello everyone! For the past week I have been working on a little project. I am an amateur composer (I've really only composed as a hobby for 2-3 year) and I love the soundtrack for Destiny so I wanted to write my own version of Cabal Stomp from Destiny 1. At first I wanted to do Fallen S.A.B.E.R. or maybe the First Array, but Cabal Stomp gave me much more room for creativity in its direction.

This track: Cabal Surrection is supposed to be for a legion I made up called the Lightbreakers. Who, similar to the Fallen House of Dusk, are the last remaining Cabal in the system, and after being on the run from Guardians and the agents of Darkness, have succumbed to the Deep and taken a deep drink from the Void. They aren't Taken, but they're not just Cabal anymore. This legion is the final legion, and they are hell-bent on retaking what they have lost from all their other conflicts thus far.

[Link to the track](https://youtu.be/u50wXrxOV3o)

For those interested I will do a short write up on what I actually did when writing the song and my thoughts when writing.

At first, I just wanted the track to be my own version of Cabal Stomp, so I really didn't have a plan at all. I started off with the piano because I liked the low piano in Cabal Breach, but later on I wanted to add a Pipe Organ, but that did not come to fruition because the free samples were horrible and I wasn't going to pay $100 for something I'd only use maybe once after this song. I mostly used two very nice samplers Heavyocity's GRAVITY (which I bought for half off) and Cinesamples' CineSymphony LITE (which was like $100 since I was a student. The rest of my synths and instruments were free, including the piano actually. The entire song until the main Cabal Breach melody was just build up, I mostly used the I and V chords because it my head at first I had the idea that I wanted it to be more cinematic, but it did not become that later. The section with the trumpets during the build up was my favorite part to write so I shoe-horned it in later because it was pretty original and fit the theme. The real issues started when the Cabal Stomp proper was introduced because CineSymphony did not have half notes or quarter notes or anything, it was basically staccato or legato for the strings and horns. So I had to use staccato notes and try to mask the choppiness as best as I could but making use of the synths for the countermelody portions, and by using the piano and some low synths for the bass part so the horns wouldn't just carry that by themselves. Near the end I felt rushed to end the song since it was approaching 5 minutes, so I really just threw an ending. I'm aware that in the actual game the track would be on loop and there is an ending stinger so that no matter when the player is fighting it can end naturally (yeah, I took classes on this), but I just did a calm fade out because I'm lazy.

If anyone actually read this write-up good lord... respect! I hope people liked the track!

fshxa4,J2Novae,The biggest issue with Destiny 2,"I started playing this game when Forsaken launched, and since that time, I've noticed something being introduced to Destiny 2 more and more: time-gated rng. 

Time-gated content has been a thing since the beginning of Destiny; however, with the introduction of random rolls in Forsaken, you are no longer waiting to get the gun you want. You are waiting for the *chance* to get the gun you want. This can lead to absurd amounts of time spent farming for one gun.

Let's use Spare Rations as an example. The chances of getting the exact roll you want on a Spare is 1 out of 16,128. Assuming it does indeed take 16,128 runs at around 10 minutes a run, we are looking at 2,688 hours of farming. If you play an average of 8 hours a day, that's 336 days or 48 weeks. If you space those 48 weeks over every other week due to the rotation, that is 2 years of farming. All of this is also assuming you get a Spare Rations on every single run.

The amount of rng required in this game is already ridiculous, so why do we need to time-gate that content as well? If trials wasn't time-gated or had ritual-styled static rolls, do you think there would be as much gatekeeping? If you could focus on any one weapon in reckoning, would it be more popular? I think so looking at the success of menagerie, but I'd like to hear other opinions too.",0,1585678146,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fshxa4/the_biggest_issue_with_destiny_2/,DestinyTheGame,1

fshll6,AnotherInternetBoi,Seasonal Mods,"Seasonal Mods should see either a reduction in energy cost or be made free of charge. With the big emphasis on "" Create your own Monster Killing Machine"", I'm going to go out on a limb and say a vast majority of the playerbase have yet to actually do that, because they either fully don't understand the Artifact or they arent willing to invest in the slots for the mods. For majority the most they probably do is buy Anti-Barrier, Unstoppable and Overload Weapon Mods since they require literally nothing to apply. Whilst buying the rest of the mods but never actually spending the energy to apply them to a certain type of build. The only mod I ever actually used was the Oppressive Darkness Grenades since it weaken enemies. But other than that I haven't done more. 

The main reason being armor, Bungie probably assumes everyone has high rolled armor stats and are contempt with those stats and have the free space to apply seasonal mods to fully customize the way they'll destroy enemies for the season. But reality is the best rolls people probably have ranges with 57-63 range with regular mods being invested to bring up other stats limiting the energy to apply the Seasonal Mods. 

No Casual probably even knows alot about the Mod System especially the Seasonal one, so if I'm an avid player that also doesn't want to sacrifice a Super, Recovery or Resilience mods how can you expect me to fully take advantage of the Artifact mods when your asking me to spend 6 energy to get damage reduction for using a sword parry near allies when a boss will probably just stomp me 5 Travelers away and insta gib me. Bungie is also asking you to spend energy on pointless mods such as more glimmer, gunsmith or planetary materials. DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY USE THOSE MODS?! 

Bungie actually needs to take steps to ensure people actually, you know, customize the way they play especially for Seasonal Mods since that kinda locks they way you'll play for the season if you have the weapon mods in play. Either look into offering better ways to obtain better armor rolls while keeping the challenge to obtain high rolls there, lower or remove the Artifact mod cost, some are just pointless. For the Hardcore players this probably means nothing but I'm pretty sure most of the playerbase isnt looking up Ehroar and actively applying and using the Builds he showcases.

Trials is POINTLESS in my opinion. In destiny 1 if you went flawless you would get an adept weapon and in year 3 of the game you would get an adept weapon and you would also get an ornament for your armor. Currently in Destiny 2 if you go flawless you get the same weapons and armor as the other wins on the card so it is completely pointless. The only thing you get from it is a slightly higher number on your emblem. One thing that bungie could do in trials is make it so that the weapons from the lighthouse give you one of the best perks. So say for the shotgun it is guaranteed to role with quick draw and for the sniper it is guaranteed to role with either snapshot or vorpal weapon. (even though the trials sniper is completely pointless because of revoker having a lower zoom and reversal of fortune lmao) but thats an argument for a different post. They could also at least make it so the ascendant shard is at least guaranteed after you have already gone flawless. They could also bring back the old d1 bounty system for the lower end of the PVP playerbase to give them a reason to play trials. I really enjoy the PVP side of this game and the game as a whole and i have since the beta of destiny 1 even through the dark time of year 1 of destiny 2.

fsh2ix,James2779,Is anarchy underrated? Or am i missing something?,"I rarely see people use it, even in raids like crown its only ever used for the deception cheese. 

I even keep hearing things like xeno+war rig is better but is it?

If we look at dragons spreadsheet anarchy has 8,252 dps which seems pretty bad, infact it was 8,744 before the nerfs, but it was made with the intention of pairing it with other weapons. If we pair it with an iconic weapon that is usually used alongside it (being mountaintop) that does 9,927 dps which when both are combined thats 18,179 and immediately we look at whisper and it only has 17,924 but even then thats considering a damage phase is 25seconds but that can be cancelled out by needing to refresh the anarchy shots. Also on some bosses it can keep damaging them while theyre immune, most notably being calus and argos. And on argos aswell as galhran you can apply 2 to their heads and 1 to their tail/pinky toe which will do 1.5x anarchys damage meaning anarchy does 12,378 which adds upto 22,305 which is a sizeable chunk over something like whisper.


What about if we add up a 140 like supremacy with triple tap, that adds to 13,207 dps and anarchy can get it to 21459dps. Infact the new 140 with clown cartridge and firing line can get 15,705 which actually competes with firing line line in the sand while its a special albeit it does lack total damage but it does get you to 23957 and if you can apply 3 anarchy thats 28,083 which is nuts but itll only last as long as say a 10second damage phase with reserves so in longer encounters its not exactly fair. You could also in theory do special finishers around where the dps spot will be to prolong this and make it more a realistic scenario 

All stats from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vF7ckMzN4hex-Tse4HPiVs_d9huFOKlvUoq5V41nxU/htmlview#

Also on a sidenote with 1k, you can shoot sanctified twice when hes on the ground and reload and shoot 4times which means you spend practically no time reloading as your reloading in the window when hes going into the air and cant be damaged so youre getting whispers dps even when hes on the ground and  this outdoes xeno even with war rig. You can even tie in 2-3 special sniper shots for extra dps.

Edit: i forgot to mention those dont have specs on them, boss spec will be 8.9% damage increase meaning mountaintop does 10,811 dps for combined 19,062.5dps and with anarchy 3x it does 23,189dps , supremacy does 14382.5 dps combined being 22,634.5 and the 140 with ff and cc does 17,103.5 and combined with anarchy its 25,345.75 and 3x anarchy its 29,480.75",16,1585675448,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsh2ix/is_anarchy_underrated_or_am_i_missing_something/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsgyuw,Ankouku,Saving Trials,"It can be done people. The question is how or what could be done to keep the integrity of the game mode as pinnacle pvp activity but it still be enjoyable and challenging. So lets discuss and hope bungie sees this and maybe takes a few ideas.

Right now trials is in a harsh place from top tier players farming tokens at the beginning of cards, cheaters/hacking, Lack of incentive to go flawless. And im sure theres a lot more problems but these stand out as the biggest right now.

I personally think alot of this could be solved very easily with Skill based match making or a ranked system. If Sbmm/ranked was implemented high skill players would still be having to play against their skill level, and casuals could atleast try to improve and maybe one day get that flawless card. Trials is supposed to be hard but not un-playable. No one wants to play games where youre stomped out immediately or you never have to try and just get handed wins. Everyone should always be striving to get better.

There would be significantly less incintive to cheat if just by simply playing the game and getting better at the game you have a chance at going flawless. Console seems to have Less cheating than pc but less still isnt no cheating. And i doubt that there will ever be a 100% cheat free comunity but reducing the incintive to cheat would atleast be a start. And having harsher punishments for cheaters needs to happen if there is video evidence of clear hacking (which ps4/xbox and pc are all capeable to recording) I.p. bans should be implemented. Simply just deleting or banning accounts isnt going to solve much when you can make or buy a new one and make your money back before the new one is banned. Brick their console or pc and they wont be able to keep making money from hacked carries. 

Loot incintive is almost non-existant. Adding adept weapons and increasing token drops for higher wins on cards would help. Being able to turn tokens in for random rolls on all weapons/ armor would be great incintive to atleast try. Haveing curated rolls or rolls with reduced pools of perks to increase the chance of getting a god roll and high armor rolls or masterworked armor  for 3,5,7 and flawless wins. Token farming would be cut significantly if not all togeather. I also like the idea of being able to pick youre flawless reward like sundial completetions. 

If you want to just mess around with friends and play a few trials matches a rakned/unranked system would be 100% better than SBMM. But its not a system thats currently avaliable and needs to be built possibly from the ground up. So lets start somewhere, skill based wouldnt be a bad holdover until a ranked/unranked system could be built.

 We all love the game and community and want to see it thrive and grow. So what do you all think and what would youre suggestions be?",25,1585675133,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsgyuw/saving_trials/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsgwvx,beakerducky,Workaround to get weekly bunker challenge drop on all characters,"Since the fix didn’t get applied today, here’s how you can get the powerful drop from the bunker on all toons for the week: once you complete the two weekly bounties on a character and see the “challenge completed” banner, DO NOT pick up the drop from the bunker. Complete the challenge on any other toons first. The bug is the locking out of other characters completing the challenge AFTER the drop is picked up. By not picking up the drop until all characters have completed the challenge, the bug does not apply. Also, fwiw, the drop carries over weekly resets. I picked up my EDZ bunker drops from last week after reset when the moon bunker became the challenge.",13,1585674954,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsgwvx/workaround_to_get_weekly_bunker_challenge_drop_on/,DestinyTheGame,6

fsghv8,Dark-Zafkiel,Bungie Had Two Years (approximately) to Make Trials Succeede,"Ever since they took trials of the nine away somewhere in August 2018 we have not had trials. Albeit trials of the nine was not good. When they took Trials of the nine away they said it was a hiatus, but that turned into permanent. You would think that removing trials would mean when it got rereleased it would launch in a better place. Not at all.

Trails of the nine.
Passage cost. Nothing
Harsh meta. Double primary with lots of smgs and uriels.
Tokens. Yes
Loot on win 3,5,7 yes.
Exclusive flawless loot. Yes
Exclusive flawless ornaments yes.
Full sized loot pool where you could get any drop. Yes
Ability to pick your reward. Yes

Trials of Osiris
Passage cost. Depending on the card each week you are eating shards and a significant sum of glimmer.
Harsh meta, not as harsh but autos and snipers or shorties
Tokens yes.
Loot on 3,5,7 yes
Exclusive flawless loot. Nope
Exclusive flawless ornaments. Nope
Full sized loot poo pool where you can get any drop. No
Ability to pick your reward. No

Just from this little comparison trials of the nine did better loot. They did cater to the flawless players with ornaments, and flawless armor, but trails of the nine would grant the casual players tokens on completing challenges and you only needed 1 win to be able to spend your tokens to get any drop in the pool. The game mode was 4v4 survival or countdown depending on the week. That was the only issue with it.

Bungie should have just kept the loot like Trials of the nine if they didnt want to piss of the community. Or better yet take d1 trials and just port the game mode to d2. They could have kept the bounties that drop armor and weapons for participation. They could have kept the boons. They could have kept the adept weapons, the flawless ornaments and so on, but we were given a mode that appears to be reskinned countdown. How do I figure.

Countdown.
Assigns a team as attack and defence that sways after every round.
Spawns swap every round.
In the result of a tie defending team gets the point.
Reviving a teammate is possible with res token

Trials in destiny 2.
Spawns swap every round
Because of the point in the result of a tie we can distinguish that it is not random. Depending on the side of the spawn you have you will win or lose in a tie. I believe that last week lower spawn won ties. This points to the arguement that Trials is reskinned countdown.
Reviving a teammate is possible without res token.

All in all, Bungie had trials of the nine loot, and OG trials loot that they could have used as a baseline for trials now. Instead we got a game mode that is not even true elimination with a loot system we have never seen before or asked for without bounties for the lower skill players to get stuff by participating, without adept weapons/armor/ornaments for flawless. A restricted lootpool for god knows what reason. And most importantly a lack of incentive to even play for most players.

In my case my friend wants the titan armor. He is well below average in crucible. I am well above average and decided I would try to get him the armor. First week we got him 3 wins and lost the card. Second week we went 6-0 on sunday then lost 4 times. This week we went 5-0 on Friday night because of Bungie screwing up their reset time for trials he got nothing. He got the reward for 3 wins, but nothing on 5. Talk about disheartening. He played more trials than he ever would have in the first place. Played his heart out and he finally after 3 weeks of trying to get the gloves, doesnt get them because of bungie's bug.

fsgbvh,SOLESAVIOR,"If Revoker was Bolt Action, it would honestly still be meta.","EDIT

Some commenters are replying without reading the post, so here’s a disclaimer:

I DO NOT WANT REVOKER TO BE BOLT ACTION.

END EDIT

There’s a reason Hard Light and Revoker are meta right now. **Ammo Economy**. Why care about ammo or accuracy when you can spam 7,000 hard light rounds or infinitely shoot a sniper with no repercussions. 

Here comes the crazy idea:

*What if Revoker had only one shot in the magazine?*

Would it still be one of the most used snipers? Probably not. 

Would it still be good? Meta even?
Absolutely. 

I genuinely think it would capture the true “textbook sniper” concept of *always moving positions after each shot.* This idea got me thinking further. What if the answer was even more simple than a magazine reduction? What if we could keep 3 in the mag and *still* keep that “textbook sniper” tactic embedded into the gun to balance it in a unique way?

Here is where I came up with:

#Revoker should only refund a shot if the user begins sprinting for 2 seconds directly after. 

This would allow Revoker to counter teams of three, but keep it’s pseudo-exotic perk in check. 

TL;DR

Revoker should *NOT* be bolt action. It’s perk should just be adjusted to be more true to a “textbook” sniper rifle user.",17,1585673107,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsgbvh/if_revoker_was_bolt_action_it_would_honestly/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsg7fx,Rixien,I don’t think 6-0 cards should be matched against 6-1 or 6-2 cards. Like ever.,"The only exception being a significant lack of available player teams to pair together at 6 wins, this shouldn’t happen. One team is fighting to go flawless, the other team is probably just trying to get an extra new drop. One has so much more to gain than the other. One has so much more to lose than the other. On the mental condition-level, one is clearly going to have an advantage of hope and aspiration and drive that the other will not have. And by God does it hurt to be the broken team losing.

This weekend my team got 6-0 on a mercy ticket. We lost the mercy on our first attempt at the seventh win. The enemies went flawless. Fine. That happens, right? We had our mercy bonus still, so we had another shot, and it wasn’t even by that much that we lost the match. We weren’t out of our league, we just didn’t play well enough.

Next match we go 0-5 to a team with 17 flawless runs under their belts (btw we have none so far) and lose our chance at the Lighthouse and they go flawless. Whatever. We can still try for the sniper rifle at 7 wins. Good or bad, another gun awarded is another gun awarded. Card’s 6-1 now.

Next match we lose. Wasn’t a total stomp, but they kept advantage till the end. They proceed to go flawless and get into the Lighthouse in a match where we couldn’t even do that if we had won. 6-2.

Pretty much a stomp for the final game. We absolutely could have beat the team we were up against if we had tried harder, but we just watched three teams go flawless back-to-back off of us. We were told the sniper wasn’t good. What’s the point? We didn’t care at that point anymore. We couldn’t care. We were tired and the game insisted on telling us that our team of 3 people were effectively used by the game to raise up 9 players to “new” heights and accomplishments. Pretty sure that that fourth got into the Lighthouse too. Good for them.

fsflej,Kleindog12321,Bungie take a break with the seasonal content and fix the core game modes first,"Bungie needs to cut the seasonal track or take a break for a year or until they fix their base game, and this is how I think it can be done:

RAIDS
- add proper prestige modes that have new or uniquely modified encounters
- introduce new or modified armor for prestige that have a unique look and possibly a special perk, for instance having a full crown of sorrow armor set on allows the player to have more target acquisition with hive based weapons, would make raid armor have a higher value other than stat roles
- makes raid weapons feel special, for instance just add an intrinsic perk such as the garden of salvation weapons piece through enemy shields better(as many of the enemies have shields so it would make sense the the weapons get this intrinsic perk to make the, feel special)
- make old raids have purpose, possibly add a rotating weekly raid that grants pinnacle gear
- make raid keys return form wrath of the machine to all raids so they can be replayed to earn keys and possibly more loot

STRIKES
- we need more depth to strikes loot, the new strikes in shadow keep are great, but useless
- possibly adding at least 1 armor and 1 weapon to every strike as a exclusive would be great
- bringing back the skeleton chest at the end would make a great addition, as I know people who have done 100’s hallowed lair strikes and have gotten barely any mindbenders
- each weapon or armor piece could also have a special well thought out perk such as wearing these titan arms and shotgun from a certain strike could allow you to get the traction mod built in for free in the mod slot on the titan mark

CRUCIBLE &amp; TRIALS &amp; IRON BANNER
- continue with the pinnacle weapons, just think out the perks better, such as a sidearm that gains higher rate of fire with each headshot or something even better as a good perk doesn’t need to up the dps of a weapon
- continue to balance weapons and keep sandbox stable, don’t let certain weapons stay overpowered
- refresh the crucible armor and weapons for god sake with new models
- make the armor be special, possibly an armor set for comp that glows brighter as you get closer to 5500, hell make it go to 10000 as a good way to show off your skills
- possibly make more weapon archetypes to spice up crucible 
- possibly have crucible weapons be special by making them have risk reward aspects, more headshot damage on a new 90 rpm sniper but it has less target acquisition or maybe a auto rifle that shoots 900rpm and has high dps compared to the normal 900rpm archetype of auto but it’s bloom gets larger as you shoot and doesn’t stop getting larger. If we are going to continue making damage perks they need to have a downside to them also to prevent power creep.
- trials needs to have loot for the casual and sweaty players, we need adept weapons with intrinsic perks as flawless rewards
- trials also needs the bounties that award armor pieces and weapons, to allow the casual player to get anything out of playing trials
- iron banner armor and weapons also need new and innovative rewards, possibly armor and weapons that revolve around team play
- iron banner is themed around us guardians as a pack of wolves working together to defeat our opponents, why don’t we have armor and weapons that compliment this
- a suggestion is to add intrinsic perks to the armor set that possibly have increased mobility while moving as a pack or a lone wolf perk that gives the player less recoil when away from their team or pack
- I feel that each pvp mode needs to loot to make it stand out from one another, as of right now armor and weapons are becoming redundant and useless and if each activity gives me armor and weapons that aren’t unique in some way then what’s the point of getting new guns or weapons
-fix the damn hackers 

GAMBIT
- I believe gambit is a great mode, just needs to be spruced up, better than jokers wild did
- make each gambit boss special with their own mechanics to improve involvement and stimulate strategy and learning of the new bosses 
- if gambit prime is going to stay then it needs to be more solidified as its own game mode compared to normal gambit, prime needs its own ranking system such as comp does in normal crucible
- make more special gambit prime armor that can be earned from playing gambit and not the reckoning, the perk system on the armor was very innovative and can be enhanced by adding more types or classes, such as the trapper, this type of armor set in gambit allows the player to send different types of blockers that annoy and possible trap the players more from across the map or while invading the trapper armor set allows them to set literal traps around the enemy teams map by spending their motes
- then such as my other ideas make weapons that have synergy with the game mode, possibly and perk in gambit that allows a sniper to have dragon fly and explosive rounds and knock back rounds only when invading, this would go nicely with the invader armor set
- possibly give the player and option to set their blockers, as there are three options of enemies for 5 motes that can be set before the game like kill streaks in cod
- for example at 15 motes the player before they enter a gambit game can set their 15 more blocker to and ogre or a cyclops or a group of 5 stronger than normal thrall, the possibilities are endless
- also who said it has to be 5 or 10 or 15 motes, over time bungie can add more enemy and mote combinations, such as 8 motes and you can spawn in two harpys 
- I believe the player could choose between three amounts of more before game for instance, billy can set a blocker for 3, 8, and 16 more deposits
- blockers could also have mote costs that could be used to make blocker Loadouts, as a thrall is 2 motes or a vandal is 3 and a player can set one of their three options to 5 motes and whenever they bank 5 motes and taken thrall and vandal pop out
- this blocker Loadouts would revitalize gambit and allow a greater level of personalization and option

I believe these changes to the core game modes area huge leap in the right direction for destiny, these are the permanent game modes and they could be and need to be so much better before bungie can cram in more modes that will disappear every 3 months.

I've been thinking about the Trials issues that have come to the forefront of this sub and if there was anything unique I could point out. I was going to write about how it's weird that Trials was in development for so long and Bungie never anticipated the matchmaking issues (punished with a loss even if your teammate was Beaver'd out), stomping issues (farming 1-3 wins for gear), rewards issues (unable to turn in tokens until reaching 3 wins), etc.

Then I watched the Bungie ""Trials of Osiris Returns - Dev Insight"" video (link at the bottom) and it hit me - they talk about testing Trials constantly in their playtest lab, and show the Bungie team enjoying the crap out of it. And that's all awesome, and needed. But they're playing each other. Locally. You can't test connection issues or matchmaking issues (at least some of those) that way.

However, if they implemented beta servers ahead of launch they'd be able to get feedback across all of the Trials issues that occurred, from connections to rewards. You wouldn't hit everything, but you would hit enough that you could at least get some valuable numbers and logs on dropping from matches, which would benefit Trials, Survival, etc.

Time and cost are always a factor in standing up infrastructure like this, but if you charged $5 a pop like Frontier does you'd be able to hire staff to manage that infrastructure and player engagement, and you'd get the benefit of happier players and a higher-quality product. (Yes, Frontier's had its own share of issues with *Elite* and it's not a perfect example, but I think it's still an example of a good idea in general.)

\------------------------------------

Below are random thoughts and commentary on the issues. It may or may not be as helpful as a specific suggestion, so read on at your own peril.

\------------------------------------

Now let's be honest, I'm sure there are some other reasons to not do this that I'm not thinking of. Or let's say that Bungie just decides to not do anything like this because of X, Y, or Z.

Then what's the solution here? What would help Bungie hunker down and figure out how issues like this keep happening in Destiny? People throw out ideas all day long - it's management's fault, it's the QA team's fault, it's the Steam server's fault, it's development's fault, etc.

No matter whose fault it is, why do we have this many connection errors without a patch for weeks or months? No matter whose fault it is, why do players still get penalized when a teammate leaves or gets kicked from a match?

I have limited knowledge of software and development work although I do have some, and while I know that issues like these are almost always more complicated than they seem, I also know there's usually a few different ways you can fix an issue. Maybe the most obvious fix to us won't work (""if a teammate is kicked, remove any penalty from losing, but still reward the winner""), but maybe there's another fix that could work (the penalty still gets applied, but it now takes four losses to reset your card instead of three).

\------------------------------------

My main point is this: Bungie staff said in the same Dev Insight video that ""We want to make sure that we really stick the landing with Trials, it's important that this doesn't go out half-baked."" It's obvious that portions of the game mode are great (come on, this is Destiny, it's fun to play!), but that other portions really were half-baked or not baked at all.

I'm at the point that I'm frustrated with what feels like a TV ad approach to communication about the game. I love the gameplay and I'll keep coming back to it, but I'm tired of hearing ""This new thing is going to be great!"" when it's obvious they haven't played the game in the same way as their playerbase. Yes, they play it locally and at home and enjoy it themselves which is awesome and necessary, but going weeks and months with disconnects shows it's more half-baked than they realize. Or, that something has gone wrong in the organization and it takes a year to fix a core issue because of the confusion and lack of focus. My suggestion at the moment is beta servers, but I'm sure there are a hundred other things that could be a fix.

We love this game, Bungie, please do what you have to do to give way more attention to these important details. We know you love the game too, but when you ignore obvious issues it feels like you're a climate change denier and we're just baking in the sun.

fsf5n6,PapiLonqLegz,"""Trials Is sooo baaad"" - Everyone","I legit don't get why people give trials such a bad rep... I've gone Flawless Multiple Times and I fall in that Top 9% ELO for Trials, and let me tell you.

Granted, we don't have ADEPT Weapons which was what made Trials be Trials in D1. A weapon with a Different cosmetic and Shader. Also, they are using the ""normal"" armour that used to drop while playing Trials in D1, While the one that you could put Ornaments on it was awarded Higher up the Card. Another thing, the economy system is broken and forces players like ME to farm 1-4 Wins and reset the Card running the Wealth Passage. Its sad, I know that guys. But, I'm going to sound entitled maybe conceited... but Although Trials could be better, and has seen better days. If YOU (Casual/Average) came to Trials, expecting to go Flawless... then you in for it... everyone who comes to Trials are expected to be Sweats, or Try Hards. And a lot of people complain that they will never go Flawless because its too hard. Separate Flawless Players to their own bracket, etc... 

Trials pushes YOU to be good at the game, and I feel that ME being a mega PVP Mongol should get rewarded by HARD EARNED GEAR (albeit no the best). I've seen so many changes made to PvE and PVP is being sitying there gathering dust. Just a couple of Meta Shifts... 

Sincerely, all of us who've gone flawless! Keep it up..! Everyone else, thrive, endure! Keep at it..! Get better, and earn the gear!

If you separate Flawless players vs Flawless Players, then, everyone will be mad, because we're going to get more gear, and stronger gear. Then, everyone will complain because they can't compete with it and they feel entitled to have it. Then devs will cater to PvP Casuals and then same thing... Cycle Repeats itself...

fseveb,chattymcgee,"I've started a Walkabout to reconnect to this game, and it's working","I pulled a complete set of white armor and weapons from collections and put them on my Titan. I put everything else into the vault. 

I started in Trostland and started working through all the Lost Sectors in the EDZ. No fast travel or sparrow allowed. If I see a public event I engage. I don't think I've been sprinting either, although I didn't make that a rule for myself.

I use the weapons and armor I pick up. Everything is dropping between 997 and 1000, so power level is not an issue. 

It's been refreshing. Instead of my normal world where I can choose from 20 god rolled hand cannons, I'm hoping for blue engrams just so I can get one. I'm using a crappy grenade launcher because that is all I have so I have to make do. I am stopping to smell the proverbial roses. I am walking out of lost sectors for the first time in years. It was always about fast travel and efficiency before. I forgot what it was to notice how nice the caves look.

It feels like Destiny is supposed to feel. My plan is to work through the lost sectors on every planet in the same fashion. If my Warlock needs to take care of Bunker business at reset, so be it, but the Titan is going to keep on keeping on.

fsel16,IHzero,Lets have an Arms Week,"Armsday was great back in D1, it let you farm specific weapons for good rolls.  

In D2 it would be great to have like one week a month where all the Weapons Foundries come to the tower and hawk their wares to guardians.  

Each Foundry would have some generic bounties that would result in a random weapon drop, but you could accept an ""endorsement"" from a single foundry and work on more complicated bounties, and a mini-quest line that leads to an exotic made by that foundry (Like the Suros Regime, or the Indomitable Skull Fort).  Players could choose the same foundry next month, or a different one.   Rep would grow faster the more of that Foundry's armor and weapons you used.  The top of the rep tree would give weapon and armor ornaments, as opposed to adding new weapons to the loot pool.   

To free up the RAM for this we should end the Black armory forges.  The Black Armory then would become one of the Foundries for Armsweek, and their exotic quest would be to retrieve all their forges (which would then appear in Ada's shop area).  

Right now, players wear a mismatch of armor or seasonal armor.  Destiny 1's goal of making players look match the activity they most often perform (like raid armor or crucible) is completely gone.

fsebi4,reicomatricks,How Trials of Osiris (in D1) drove Player Engagement,"This has been a hot topic over the last few weeks and I want to try and clear up a few misconceptions regarding why D1 ToO was so successful, compared to the latest iteration in D2.

First, a bit about me (since I know Reddit needs some sort of Author Credibility)

I played Trials of Osiris *every weekend*. I always found people to play with, whether it was with friends or LFG. I have people on my friends list to this day that I started playing with back in D1 Trials. 

I only went Flawless ONCE. I got there with two monsters named Fly and Dean, I got a Jewel of Osiris (Adept) and it became my favorite gun overnight for Arc Burn activities. I am no god, and am arguably ""a casual"" when it comes to Trials of Osiris. I was still able to put together a full set of armor, and collected a few weapons as well.

I have gotten to Legend in Comp twice, and if I do it again this season I will get Unbroken. Thank you Freelance Playlist for making this dream a possibility.

Let's get into it:

* **Passage Coins &amp; Tokens**

Trials of Osiris in D1 revolved around Passage Coins, these were earned by LOSING Trials matches, and also had a chance to drop at the end of a game of regular PvP. Passage coins were used to buy consumable items (boons) that would give boosts on your Card, such as the Favor of Osiris, Mercy of Osiris, or Boon of Osiris. These would give a free win on an empty card, remove a loss, or make your first win count for two wins.

Note that I said consumable items? These things were totally independent of your card, which you could reset without using your boons. There was a strategic use to these items, such as players choosing to use their next-win-counts-for-two boon on their 8th game. You had access to all three over the course of your run, instead of having them built into the card. We didn't have to choose between forgiving a loss over a bonus victory.

D2 doesn't have Passage Coins to buy consumable items that have the potential to make our runs easier. It has Tokens that are used to buy packages that serve as loot boxes from Saint, whose rewards are only accessible if you win a certain number of games. Not only are the rewards inaccessible if you don't win, but your Tokens vanish at the end of the weekend, so even if you were to farm up a bunch, any progress you do make will go away. Passage Coins *never* went anywhere. They always sat in your inventory and subtly reminded you: Try again next weekend.

* **Loot &amp; Rewards**

The conversation of Adept Weapons from the Flawless Lighthouse Chest has been discussed to death, but there has been very little discussion regarding what it was that brought players like myself into the playlist every single weekend. 

First, loot would drop at the end of a match. The losing team would get Passage Coins, and the winning team had a chance at getting a random weapon or armor piece, and it is important to note: that the higher you went in your card, the better those odds became. There was no ""Farm the bottom of the card"" because the odds of loot dropping increased the more wins you had on your card. You had a very real incentive to play as deep into the card as you could.

So, not only were you able to get rewards from a certain number of wins on a card (just like today in D2) but just by playing you would see loot. If you lost a few games, you kept going back to the Reef to spend your Passage Coins to buy more boons to keep trying again and again. If you won a few games, you would likely get a gun or armor drop.

Secondly, there were Bounties that rewarded you for your effort. The bounties were divided into Tiers that would have a chance at dropping upgrade materials, Passage Coins, exotics, or Trials Gear.

These bounties ranged from stuff like ""Defeat 3-5 Enemies while being close to an ally"" and ""Earn 75 points; wins are worth x and losses are worth y"" and ""Play 10 games and Defeat 75 Enemies"". The first dropping upgrade materials, the second being the midrange Passage coin rewards, and the third being the big money, having a *chance* at dropping Trials Gear. There were weekends where you'd turn in that bounty and get a generic purple and it sucked, and other weekends where you'd get that coveted weapon or piece of armor you'd been chasing.

* **Trials Passages**

As I mentioned briefly above, the D1 Trials Passage was simply a punchcard that tracked wins and losses. The boons could be used strategically before or after a game, and when you forgave a loss, it actually just disappeared from your card. It's important to note that in D1: it took NINE wins to get to the Lighthouse. D2 Trials it takes SEVEN. Rewards in D1 happened at FIVE and SEVEN wins, in D2 they happen at THREE and FIVE.

It absolutely needs to be noted that it's actually easier than ever to hit the weekly milestones, but fewer players than ever are participating because of the overall lack of incentive. The general community has disengaged from the activity en mass within the first three weekends of this new iteration of Trials returning, and as a former played-it-every-weekend guy it's heartbreaking to me that I actually can't find a reason to play it. I got three wins the first weekend and got a couple scout rifles and an emblem, the tokens I had left over vanished, then the next thing we know top tier teams are farming the bottom end of the card because not only is there no incentive for Flawless, the best rewards are coming from the bottom of the card? And there's no incentive to play? We spent a couple hours playing and didn't hit three, and couldn't turn in our tokens for anything other than scout rifles otherwise we would lose those tokens? I know that last paragraph is just beating a dead horse, but... what?

* **Summary**

You can make the arguement that ""Trials is for the sweaty"" or that ""Trials is meant to be a top-tier activity"" but that isn't what TRIALS is, or.. I guess, that's not was it *was*.

The LIGHTHOUSE was for the sweaty, the LIGHTHOUSE was for the top-tier.

Trials *was* the weekend game mode that the ENTIRE PVP PLAYERBASE got hyped for, with the best of the best achieving victory while the rest of us worked on our bounties and worked on improving our play so that we can one day improve our skills until we meet a couple guys named Fly and Dean on LFG and make it there ourselves, and feel like we worked for it and earned it.

Trials was never made to be make or break, it had an entry level, it had mechanisms that drove player engagement every weekend. I cannot for the life of me hear words from Bungie saying that they [wanted to stick the landing with Trials and make sure it doesn't go out half baked](https://youtu.be/5QJFw2HtxvU?t=134) when they've completely gutted the mechanisms that pulled us into the activity.",12,1585666546,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsebi4/how_trials_of_osiris_in_d1_drove_player_engagement/,DestinyTheGame,2

Back when Revoker was first revealed, there was a lot of complaining about how it was a terrible Pinnacle weapon on this sub, featuring the usual not-so-humble bragging in the comments such as “lol who misses shots” or “why would I need RoF when I always hit headshots”.

Fast forward almost a year and it’s certainly changed. Looking at https://trials.report/ , Revoker has been the most popular weapon by far in Week 3 of Trials and has cracked the top ten on each map.

fse6px,chundamuffin,As a new player - destiny is really fun,"I hopped into the game trying to find something to play with friends.

It was easy to try out a few strikes and it was a short learning curve. It was easy to convince a few extra friends to join. Now we’ve got a pretty sizeable crew playing together. I’m having a really great time

I’ve played a few other mmos before. Guild wars 2, wow, black desert.

This game is the most fun so far because of the shooting mechanics. That’s ultimately the building block for everything else.

The shooting mechanics make for fun raids, fun pvp and fun strikes.

The story’s decent and the atmosphere is great.

I see a lot of complaints on here and get it. I’ve been there before with other mmos. The loot doesn’t feel rewarding sometimes, the game isn’t balanced, is too much of a grind.

If you’re feeling this way, consider stepping back, play a different game for a while. It’s a sign you’re not enjoying the core gameplay.

If you’re not enjoying the shooting, if you’re playing for the ends not for the means, maybe just take a break until that itch comes back.",448,1585666073,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fse6px/as_a_new_player_destiny_is_really_fun/,DestinyTheGame,6

fse2st,VojakOne,Our Culture is Harming the Crucible,"Hey Guardians. 

I've noticed a difference in culture develop in our community since the launch of Destiny 2 that we really aren't talking about. And I think it's the core reason why we see so many passionate takes about the Crucible. Lemme explain - 

In Destiny 1, everything was *new.* We had zero balancing expectations. Zero clue what endgame PvP would look like. Minimal thoughts on what actual balance was. Because of this, we largely took what we got and the largest outliers were addressed. In those days, we got an example of what was truly overpowered - and it was those things that got nerfed. 

For example, Vex Mythoclast and the original SUROS Regime. Or the infamous two-tap Thorn. Etc. 

In Destiny 2, we had - and have - expectations. But those expectations have been tainted by the nostalgia we have for D1. In the Crucible, specifically, we are so entitled that we don't believe we should lose. And that's the core problem that we're not talking about. For some reason, we've gotten it in our heads that if something downs us, it's overpowered. That it's an overused gun's fault, that something - *anything* - is to blame. 

We call for nerfs, seasonally, on weapons that don't come remotely close to the levels of broken as OG Thorn. How many angry tweets went up this week about Revoker? How many 1% voices put it on the same pedastal as OG Thorn? Or Hardlight for that matter? 

We've become entitled and that's what's going to kill this game. Not Trials being ""lackluster"" or failing. Not Bungie ""failing"" to balance PvP - which has never been perfect mind. It's the fact that we, as a community, have the toxic mindset that we shouldn't lose in the Crucible. 

I love this game. We all do. Let's please take a look in the mirror and stop the cancer from spreading.",9,1585665681,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fse2st/our_culture_is_harming_the_crucible/,DestinyTheGame,0

fsdsox,mynameis_mcq,Trials superfan and total scrub here. Give me a (tiny) reason to play?,"Jumping on the Trials casuals bandwagon here to offer some perspective directly from those of us mercilessly beaten down by the rest of y'all on your way to the lighthouse (you beautiful heroes). 


I love Trials. I love how sweaty it is. I love getting mapped 4 seconds after spawn somehow by someone cross-map with a sidearm (Somehow? Amazing. A thing of beauty). I love learning and practicing and swapping loadouts and... every now and then, having a hero moment or a great match and feeling generally amazing about myself. I want so badly to lose for hours on end every weekend punctuated by the very occasional win or even just competent round. 


But I don't have much reason to, and that makes me terribly sad. It's not that I want gobs of loot... I just want like, one helmet or something that I earned with my hard work and massive pile of deaths. I played D1 trials (just as poorly) and had maybe two or three pieces of gear THAT I NEVER TOOK OFF, because I was so proud of them. I've seen so many great suggestions of how to make this a thing for folks like me, from having one of the  weekly bounties with a high threshold that drops a piece of Trials gear, to changing the token cap to a sliding scale based on wins (I'd grind 100 tokens every weekend for one piece of gear! I would! And the pros would get their flawless cards within the first 10 minutes after reset and keep going at 20 tokens per drop and just be swimming in beautiful Osirian Majesty and I'd be so proud for them)... anything to throw me the tiniest bone to keep playing. 3 wins on one card is... not possible for me. 3 wins any point during the weekend? Yeah, I could do that. 


I got my one win in this season so I could order that hat. I ordered it immediately and cannot wait to show it off. My scrubby self absolutely will spend real-world cash to celebrate the most meager success. Please, Bungie, keep making money off of me like this! But I'd love to show off in-game, too! 


I love making LFG posts that say things like ""Wanna get rekt in Trials? Join me for Sad Trombone Emote Party 2020."" I love playing with other scrubs. My favorite trials experience was finding two hilarious dudes in one of the last weeks of D1 trials who were just increasingly drunk, chill, and happy, and played with me for hours, just laughing at how hilariously bad we were. We pulled off two wins on a card once! Still my personal record! I want that back, so bad, but with no rewards available to me, I can't have it. 


Because I'm a Destiny dad with two full-time jobs and a happy marriage and that takes more time than I can give to becoming crucible god. I'm okay? I did the grinds for Revoker, Recluse, Randy's, and (R)komodo, and those were a blast, even if they took me 4x longer than everyone else. I'll never be elite. But the current narrative that is actively being advertised is ""Carry or be carried? Which is your path?"" And that's sad for me! I don't want to be carried! I want to hold my own, with what little I have to hold. And I want a tiny something to show for it.


I know there's going to be a resounding ""git gud, this isn't for you, scrub,"" and yes, you're right. There should ALWAYS be rewards for those who can and do put in the time to be elite. That's what adept weapons were for. And armor glows. And flawless emblems. I'll never, ever, ever, have those, and I'm great with that. I *want* it to take hours and hours and hours of top-tier play to get a full set of ornamented , 60+ stat roll Trials Armor and god-rolled Trials weapons. I want to emote with reverence towards players I see wearing those in the tower. 


I just want to do it wearing one ratty pair of 45-total stat roll gloves that I got for 20 hours of dying repeatedly to squeak by with enough kills to say I earned it. 


Please, Bungie. I love this season, honestly, I do. I actually love the bounty grind and the push to use different weapons in different settings, and the daily chores... I love 'em! And I want my weekends to be filled with Trials as a complement to that, as part of the narrative. But right now... it's not worth my time.

fsdgbq,caroteo,Some random thoughts from an ex-Kinderguardian,"Bungie just made changes to the Faction armor sets that are world drops, and I can finally get some useful armor. As shitty New Light that entered the Solar System in the last stages of SoU, I can finally get pieces that take Undying and Dawn mods. During Undying, I had no idea how tf to play the game, and so never got any good armor. Because New Lights didn't get a good tutorial or explanation of anything,  I spent my days running Vex Offensive despite initially thinking it was the GoS raid. I only got a couple decent guns, but no armor. With Dawn, my Warlock (which I main) got all the 60+ stat pieces of the season pass, but my dumb NL ass decided to use them for infusion (stats hadn't been explained to me).

So, even though I blew my chances during the seasons themselves, I now can get Undying and Dawn armor! This is great for New Light players. Also, I want to note that the tips during load screens, while super basic and somewhat obvious, are great for teaching NL guardians wtf is going on in D2.

fsddpj,Etarder,"Bungie, It's Time To Explain What We Should't Have To Waste Time Explaining","There are undoubtedly things i missed, words i misspelled and run on sentences. I am just not getting off of a 12 hour shift, not including the time it will take to write this dissertation and for that i apologize. Below are my thoughts and feelings on a very small portion of what is wrong with the world and franchise we have come to love. If you choose the time to read this share some of your thoughts, feelings, or maybe just some of your memories of Ethernet cheesing, Atheon solar grenade cheesing or anything else you can think of.    

Bungie, there comes a point where we as a community are fed up with opaque responses and veils of secrecy that serve no real purpose but to keep us guessing and keep us wanting. This isn't a post about threads of the game that seem lost to time, or inconsistency within the world and lore that you have created. This is post is about the darkness that you have kept us in concerning your anti cheat, or lack their of. Your lack of server stability because you choose the cheaper route of connection based matchmaking rather than investing in your creation and giving it the most stable and secure platform for us to explore and wage battle against each other upon. The loss of unique builds that made crucible fresh and entertaining each match.

Let's start with the fact that you have at the helm of your creation an employee who wrote the now famous Halo 2 is broken article. Sure in that article Luke Smith really is only talking about pvp, and the consequences of the choices that Bungie's decisions had on the balance of the game. However, when we take into account that the person at the helm of your creation is the one who wrote that article we have to wonder how the in the name of the travelers last fallen shard we have the embarrassment that you call crucible today. No real anti cheat, server stability that is less impressive than that of most indie developers, balance issues that still plague the crucible, and a design choice that has led to just a complete cluster fuck on most maps. 

You designed a game for 4v4 and you did something rare for your studio and you listened to the community and you changed it back to 6v6 like the crucible of old. However, in doing so you never thought if you should. Your maps were designed around 4v4, your spawns, choke points, heavy ammo spawns and map flow were all designed with that in mind. Why do you think that so many guardians hate the D2 maps? Is it because they are just bad design with clear imbalance and unfair advantage granted to which ever team happens to get the good spawn? Or is it the fact that you built maps for 8 guardians to sore through, casting supers and sniping lanes? Is it that you designed your maps with only primaries in mind, thinking that you may have 1-2 guardians watching a lane at a time with their heavy snipers? Were your maps designed with all a corner every 5 feet because you intended for shotguns to be heavy weapons with only a few kills going to sliding shotguns each game? 

Whatever your intentions were for the crucible in D2 I can assure you that barring the year 3 special ammo economy update that D1's crucible felt far superior. That may be because we moved slower across the board in D1, or it may be because bar 1 exotic we only had the chance to literally evade from danger when playing 1 specific sub class. Warlocks couldn't glide off of the map and snipe you from the heavens or rip your face off from Twilight Gap while your capping B on Shores of Time. Titans, which i main, could only shoulder charge you with their striker class but you better believe my shotgun kills would grant me an over shield when I threw on my No Back Up Plans. 

The reason that so many people complain about he ""meta"" is because you took away or chance to play the game our way and use things that we made work for us. I used to run with guardians who hated snipers with scopes, so they ran No Land Beyond. I ran with warlocks who didn't understand the fuss about weapons because they threw on Nothing Manacles and walked around with pocket Gallys all game. I myself was a titan that couldn't take off No Back Up Plans with my Felwinters Lie with shot package, before it was taken away. We had our hunters that jumped to the heavens with their Bones of Aeo just like they do now with their Stomp-ee5, but the you had the spicy hunters that ran Khepri's Sting and would kill you in your roaming super if you weren't paying attention. You had your Twilight Garrison Titans that just ran from every fight, but then you had your Empyrean Bellicose titans that would completely throw off your gun fight because they would hover and wait to pick you off. You had your Ram wearing warlocks that could just stand in a gunfight for what seemed like forever, but then you had your warlock that were simply artillery machines with Voidfang Vestments. Hunters with 4 Golden Gun shots because they rocked Achlyophage Symbiote or Arc Blades that lasted FOREVER because of Mask of the Third Man. Titans that could dive bomb you and have aftershock because of The Helm of Inmost Light, or titans that would simply vomit out or light all game because the ran Ward of Dawn with Crest of Alpha Lupi. 

The point is you used to make us choose how we wanted our guardians to sycronize with our weapons and exotics. Exotics used to make our subclasses stronger. Now ever hunter evades away from danger with weapons that are always reloaded and health bars that are always regaining because every one has 100 recovery. Most warlocks evade from danger and have a melee attack that spans what feels like the whole map sometimes while being able to hover in the air and obtain angles and vantage points that there is no way were intended to be accessible. Titans are able to shoulder charge with a subclass color of their choosing and have literal walls that can be used to revive in a game mode where reviving is the single most important aspect of the mode. Some subclasses have the most ridiculous tracking with their ranged super while others seems to be close to no tracking at all. Why did you ever thing that the titan slam should be mobile? Why does the Golden Gun get shots on shots on shots on shots while Blade Barrage can literally hit people and do no damage? Why does Dawn Blade have just bonkers tracking while hammers seem to have none? Why do Slowva Bomb and Thunder Crash work around corners and through walls sometimes but not others?

With that wall of text above Bunige, it does even begin to touch on the thing that is crippling not only your crucible, but the spirit of the guardians that play it. The cheating, the obvious in your face cheating that is so rampant that certain people do it just to be able to compete. You professed that you weren't going to bring back Trials until it was right. Not the right time, but the right way. You professed that it had to be that way so it could succeed. That was a lie, what you meant was we won't bring Trials back until we need something for people to cling to while we figure out what to do next. The problem you have here is what you brought back was not the Trials of old as promised, but a predatory version of it. A version filled with cheaters and the top tier of players praying of the casuals and the less gifted guardians who simply want to try for that coveted gear. Rapidly diminishing are the guardians who say to their friends "" lets hop on and grind out these bounties just so i can maybe get a specific drop"". 

Mtashed said it best in his latest video that even in his carries he wasn't even attempting to get his carries flawless because there is literally no point. There is no reason to go flawless when all the rewards, some titles, are obtainable by merely wining 3 games at some point in the season. Oh you can get an ascendant shard sometimes, whelp my master nightfall doesn't take as long and guess what doesn't bar me from my rewards, cheaters. You launched your most competitive game mode with no real anti-cheat, no aspirational rewards, and a token system that is so ass backwards that even getting the three wins required to even use my tokens can seem impossible for some simply because top tier players are resetting their cards after 3 wins because of the value of being able to farm tokens and drops.  

Why should Mtashed, Buttwipe, Jake, Krafty, Lumi, Gigz, Panduh, Leopard, Datto, IFrostBolt, Glad, Cammy, Ms5000, Astecross or any of countless other streamers both big and small dedicate their time to your game when you have proven that their time, effort, free advertising that they are actually paying to to be able to even advertise, and in some cases their livelihood means nothing to you. How fun is it to watch any of these insanely talented people carry for lack of a better term "" helpless "" guardians to the lighthouse when they have to reset the card multiple times because a fucking beaver is cutting down whatever power pole happens to feed electricity directly to their house. How awesome is it to see streamers unable to help guardians that may never have a chance to get to the lighthouse, and who used their channel points against 1000-3000 other guardians get beat by self reviving teleporting hackers. Hackers, who have vac bans on their accounts. Hackers who aren't even maybe cheating. Hackers whose aim bots are so obvious Helen Keller would see their shot and throw a red card. Hackers, who have FULL AUTO GRAVITON LANCES. Hackers who spawn with heavy ammo. I wish that we as community did see all that THIS WEEKEND. Take BattleState games who develop Escape From Tarkov. The community for years provided data and proof that their in house anti-cheat was as useful as Asher Mir while we explored IO. After the community dwindled they finally saw our frustration and implemented battleye. I don't pretend to understand game development, but i do understand when things do not work. What you are doing Bungie, DOES. NOT. WORK.

Bungie, you have proven time and time again that our time is not respected. I don't work in a hospital, especially given the current events, just to come home and feel like my time is being wasted by noting more than developer greed. Gone is the Golden Age where we could earn our ornaments in Destiny by achieving the greatest feats a guardian could. Gone is the Golden Age of crucible where i felt that when i lost a gun fight, or had to reset my Trials card that it was because i was sure i was out skilled or out classed. Gone is the Golden Age of content where my controller was in serious danger if i was clapped by one more Matador 64 or Party Crasher +1, so i would just go clap Oryx's cheeks or exact revenge on Axis for what Siva did to my bae Jolder. 

Perhaps what we as guardians failed to see this whole time was that the real "" Darkness "" was your greed. We supported and praised you for breaking from Activision to create your Destiny. In return we have been nickeled and dimed for all we have. Never forget that Warframe made $182.5 million in revenue in 2018 while your digital revenue was an estimated $300 million in 2019. Warframe, the same company who has been hailed for their content and the same company who removed microtransactions because they felt it was too predatory and people were using them to often. You are very fortunate that Anthem and the Division 2 are in the state they are. Anthem by all accounts was disaster at launch, murdered before i even had a chance to live. However, the rumor around Fort Tarsis is a huge update in the future that will change Anthem to the world the Freelancers deserve. The Division 2, which isn't in a truly bad state bar some imbalance in the difficulty sector. Division agents feel rewarded for their time and their effort, something guardians haven' t felt for years.

You should be thankful for the your Community Managers like dmg04, Cozmo23, and Deej. For years they have been the barrier between the real life guardians and the Darkness that in your decision making. They have done the the travelers work, that is instill hope and light in the community. Promising us that we are heard and that our wishes, concerns, hopes, and praises are being brought back to the dev team. We as a community that and appreciate you and we wouldn't have made it this far without your support.",22,1585663166,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsddpj/bungie_its_time_to_explain_what_we_shouldt_have/,DestinyTheGame,1
fsddn2,MadBuc,I think it would be fun if Bungie converted Survival playlist theme to Trials of the Nine theme,"Hear me out. 

Y1 Trials of the Nine are pretty much done and gone. Weapons, armor, etc (thankfully you can use Flawless ornaments on ToO armor) 

What if Bungie converted Competitive Survival playlist to Trials of the Nine playlist? It would be the same Competitive Survival, but with Trials of the Nine theme and rewards. After all, TotN in Y1 had Survival gamemode. 

You will get Trials of the Nine rewards (random rolled weapons and armor) from winning matches and rank ups. After reaching certain rank you will unlock access to Emissary to spend your TotN tokens on random rolled gear, like Crucible and Vanguard. 

I know that there's literally zero chance it will happen. But one can dream. I loved Trials of the Nine theme and rewards. But I didn't like sandbox that was during Y1. Trials of Osiris are completely opposite - I like sandbox and gamemode, but reward system needs some tuning",3,1585663159,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsddn2/i_think_it_would_be_fun_if_bungie_converted/,DestinyTheGame,1

fsdb64,parsashir3,My experience with destiny 2,"Destiny 2 never seemed interesting to me . I loved destiny 1 and played Tf out of it . Destiny 2 came out and the negativity made me ...well avoid it . 
Then forsaken came out. I was still sceptical about it and didn’t touch it . First time I played destiny was when it became free for a while in battle net . Played through the base campaign and was like “meh”. Then I heard the news 
“Bungie left activision “ it was a spark that was lighting the fire that was gone years ago . My love for destiny. And more news came out . Cross save . Shadowkeep. Forsaken for only 40 dollars and destiny new light . I was hyped ! I couldn’t take it and bought forsaken on ps4. Played thro it in two sittings. Best experience I had since the taken king . Caydes death made my blood boil as a hunter . I wanted uldren neck and spine wrapped around a stick while on fire . 

A few days passed and I got to an acceptable light level to finally go for pvp activities . That’s when I got introduced to the vast weapons the game had . Spare rations ? Ace? Recluse ? Lord of wolves ? It all looked fascinating! 
But then again ... an experience can only be enhanced with friends . I looked around In lfg,s and had no luck . Until I made a guy going by the name of ldmw On psn. Such a friendly fellow he was . Taught me a bit about the game and has a lot of fun . He added me to his clan and we would play sometimes . Thro him and the lfg I Found new guys and went to play with them . Sweaty and toxicity was finally introduced to me thro the class differences in the game . Titans having one hit melees ? Not fair ! This new group was sweaty to its core ..but it was harmless . We played pvp and pve. Until I wanted to get another exotic . Thorn . The quest was frustrating. And que ldmw. He came and helped me with his friend . Took about 3 hours to beat the final boss . My dad was like : finally?
It was worth it tho . The canon was a beast. That was one of the last activities I would do with ld. 

Nevertheless. Shadowkeep was right around the corner ! Cross save came and I moved to pc. It was magical. Bought the deluxe and went through the campaign . It was quite short but satisfying. And then came my quest to get recluse. Oooooo boy . Took me 2 weeks ... with an lfg of course . A group of friends who came to forget about me . Meh I was used to it . Imagine my anger when they nerfed the gun . Wow bungie . Then came season of dawn . Saint 14? Sign me tf up ! Went thro the quests and I was like :well....what now?
The sundial looked ,..decent with a great sidearm but ...what was the point of running it ? The story was nonexistent at that point . I moved to other games in that time . Apex . Cod mw. And then season of the worthy came out . TF did you do bungie ? The game feels dead ! Trials is a damn after thought ! Adept weapons ? New armour ? No no no here’s some glow for going flawless. No ritual weapons this season ! Another horde mode like previous season except there’s balls to throw . And the plot for this season ? Fucking terrible . A ship plummeting down to the last city ? JUST NUKE IT !!!! Titans can literally yeet themselves like superman and warlocks can create gosh darn super bombs and the hunters have a damn gun that shoots the power of the damn sun ! 
Zavala : nah mate we need rasputin 
Ffs. Pvp is worse then ever now with everyone using hardlight .
That fun I had with destiny had turned to frustration and anger . The flame yet again was dying . That’s why I officially quit playing . Bungie I don’t know what the hell youre doing but this ain’t it  


I hope my long journey thro this game wasn’t too boring for people to read. Just wanted to post this so people could see the state of destiny 
And also dear streamers ? You are not helping the state of this game . Quit acting like you care about the casual fans of this game . Just reacting to the dollars and view numbers going down .",2,1585662897,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsdb64/my_experience_with_destiny_2/,DestinyTheGame,1

Like the constant error codes, Trials structure as a whole, etc. I understand when you guys mention the flaws of this game and I wholeheartedly relate, I too have been frustrated by some of these problems and flaws.

But please, remember this. Change is coming, but it's coming slowly because of the state of our world right now. COVID-19 is striking fear and unrest into the whole world, and America is no exception. Bungie resides in Bellevue, Washington, which is in the Greater Seattle area. Seattle and its surrounding areas have one of, if not THE highest number of confirmed cases in the US. I live in the same city as Bungie (I'm about a 10 minute drive away from them and have seen their office numerous times), and I have seen first hand the effect the virus have been having on the people. People are being put out of their jobs, and those who still have their jobs, are in constant fear of going to work. People are afraid to go outside unless necessary (which is what they should do), and so many of us are unsure of what the future might hold. Their lives are on the line.

Bungie may seem like a higher being that controls our world of Destiny, but in the end, they're people too. They have to look out for their own wellbeing, as well as their families. I know Destiny is in a very rocky state, a lot of issues riddle the game, I know that as well as you all do. I promise you that Bungie is working on things, as efficiently as they're allowed without jeopardizing their own safety.

fscymm,Andrea_102,"The current state of the game is absolutely appalling, and if it doesn't get addressed properly but this week's TWAB I think we should all collectively move to other games.","I have been playing Destiny on PS4 since its original release almost seven years ago. Played the alpha and the Beta and grew up with the game. I am deeply attached to this game, its world, the lore, and the characters. I always defended this game with tooth and nail, back in Vanilla D1, Vanilla D2, CoO and Warmind. When Forsaken launched I was glad that the game finally managed to fulfill its potential, both in terms of story, and gameplay. Every week we had something new to look forward to. The game no longer felt repetitive and most importantly gave you a reason to log back in every week, or day for that matter. 

At the same time I was concerned with the seasonal approach the game was taking, I far preferred having two, fully fleshed out expansions, with campaign missions, strikes, and raids. Thankfully black armory gave us a new raid, and so did Season of opulence, they felt more like proper expansions than seasons, but I digress. 

At the launch of Shadowkeep the game's future continued to look promising, but something didn't feel right. The content wasn't a lot, and when you went through it once or twice, you would realize how shallow it actually was. This only kept getting worse and worse, finally culminating with season of Dawn, where bounties started to become more and more relevant, the content kept diminishing but it was alright, ""maybe next season will be a banger"" I repeated to myself.

Season of the Worthy comes around and the trailer doesn't really show much. Just one activity, Seraph towers, and trials coming back, an activity that has been on hiatus for years now. I had a bad feeling about this, and it turns out I was right. The few scraps of content are time gated so that we think we are getting more content than there really is. The fourth horseman exotic quest was shorter than your first time getting laid, not to mention boring and mind numbing. ""Go to Ana, kill some enemies, Go to Ana, Go to Benedict, kill more enemies, do a legendary lost sector."" This quest was probably on of the most underwhelming, unoriginal quests I ever played. The search towers are a glorified public event with little to no challenge, not to mention the appalling lack of mechanical depth. At least sundial had you actually complete objectives, and would let you choose your rewards. The lack of content this season is quite frankly horrifying. Where is all of our Eververse, and season pass money going? I refuse to believe that this season was develop by a competent team when an intern could have done half the work on his own.

Finally I would also like to address the moment-to-moment gameplay and character progression. Destiny's gunplay has always been stellar, but this is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the depressing state PvE is in right now. It all started with seasonal artifacts. These are a great idea if it weren't for two massive issues: 1. They expire 2.They provide a power level boost. Let's tackle the first one. The expiration date on the artifact brings several issue with it. The first one has to do with Champions. Each season we are forced to use different weapons in PvE because anti-barrier, disruption, and unstoppable mods shift weapon category. The second has to with the mods themselves. Since the mods generally found at the end of the skill(?) tree are quite powerful people naturally streamline their build to use them, however because they expire those build only last for so long. Both of these significantly hinder our character's progression because running our favorite build is either impossible because last season is over, or inefficient because the current seasonal artifact provides a stronger seasonal mod for the best current build. I am well aware that some mods do carry over, but they are hardly if ever crucial parts of the build. The second issue has to do with gameplay as a whole. Because the artifacts provide a boost in power that is only accessible by gaining experience points, bounties now become the best way for a player to level up fast. The boost their power to whatever they desire and can now tackle challenging content like nightfalls, or legendary lost sectors while their gear is a little over 965. Perhaps this is a bit hyperbolic but I believe it gets the point across. Players shouldn't become stronger for just playing a bounty simulator, but should become stronger by tackling hard challenges, like old D1 nightfalls, trials, raids, and so on. This coincidentally brings me to my next point. The lack of challenge. The only source of challenge in this game is nowadays power. Content isn't hard anymore, strikes are quite literally a meme, nightfalls have DIFFICULTY SETTINGS; If you at all remember the challenge of a true nightfall you'll remember about players coming up with strategies and cheeses to reasonably complete a nightfall. They were tough, but they were also rewarding, something that current nightfalls are not. Exotics are so easy to come by that there is next to no reason for you to bust your ass off in grandmaster difficulty unless you are chasing that perfect stat roll on an exotic piece of armor. I could literally go on for hours about how this game has become mechanically broken, but I'll stop here.

Something that doesn't impact me directly, but still concerns me is connection quality on PC. From what I can see on reddit, and on Youtube, the state of PC servers is disgusting.

&amp;#x200B;

So to summarize

This game is lacking in every department, Connection quality, Content quantity and quality, and character progression. It's failing in every regard and Bungie still has to comment on this. This game is becoming a glorified Mobile game, and losing all of its magic, mystery, and excitement in the process. I always supported Eververse so long as it provided secondary cosmetics, but now a season only provides cosmetics and secondary content. We are no longer getting raids, strikes, crucible maps, vendor resets, campaign missions, and exciting exotics. Bungie is afraid of making players feel powerful and turned the game into a mundane shooter. So if this is not addressed by this week's TWAB I will personally uninstall the game and move to other games that get better support from their devs. I never thought I would say this, but The Division is actually more enjoyable than destiny right now, perhaps its the novelty of it, but this is saying a lot.

I think my 'not bad' rating is fair.

The first team I played, at match number one on my ToO card were these guys:

&amp;#x200B;

Player one - 2594 ELO - 22x Flawless - 3.70 KD - 5.14 KDA

Player two - 2411 ELO - 17x Flawless - 3.63 KD - 4.96 KDA

Player three - 1801 ELO - 6x Flawless - 3.23 KD - 3.99 KDA

&amp;#x200B;

They were great players and it was good to watch them move and kill, yet needless to say I was farmed. I could almost see my KD plummeting like a fast trip down the Hellmouth hole.

What I want to know is this: can we make room for people like me to learn and improve?

If I'm to 'get good' I need a place for the growth; Trials with training wheels, a Trials of Baby Osiris.

When I first raided I was terrible, but in time, with the coaching of others I was able to improve. I got better and ended up sherpering raids myself, passing the knowledge on. With raiding the contention against the 'get good' is the patience and time (see what I did there) of others.

It also incentivizes playing that activity. I bet a lot more people would run raids if a raid package for completing the ""Raid of the week"" had a chance to contain Anarchy or Divinity, along with some other little goodies.

For example (the bounty for summoner requires 10 auto kills and a match win (or even a completion). The two armor pieces will drop randomly after completing a match. This will give players access to the loot for just playing the game.

I feel like connection and card based is the beat way to go with matchmaking. I think making it to where you need to gave a loss on your card before you can reset it would be nice. It would help players against the feeling that they are being farmed just for stats.

Now, for the hardcore. Add adept weapons to the flawless chest. Give them an intrinsic perk and a glow that sets them apart from the rest. Have universal trials  armor ornaments that drop form the flawless chest that look awesome and stand out. Also give us a scarab emblem to chase after.

fsbko8,StarryStareyNight13,"Dear Destiny, it's not me it's you, we have to break up and I'm heartbroken","Hello, long time guardian first time redditor (be gentle with me). I've recently decided I have to break up with Destiny as the relationship has become stale and a little bit toxic.

TL:DR - After 5 long years of playing Destiny, I found love, gained confidence, but now I just don't want to play it anymore and it makes me sad. 

(sorry its going to be a long read) 

I was first introduced to Destiny through a friend, I was a little bit wary at first as it was an online game and as a female gamer I'd not had many positive online experiences. I gave it a go as he said he'd look after me. Long story short, he did look after me and after playing together every evening for 2 years he moved country to be with me and we now have a child together. What started as a love affair with a game became a love affair between 2 people and Destiny will always have a special place in my heart  for that.

Together we defended humanity and the last City against fallen, hive and the taken. Him a Titan, me a Hunter, together we balanced out and made an awesome team. He loves the lore of Destiny and I love shooting things (I like the lore too but he's a rediculous nerd about it and ""debates"" regularly on reddit about it).

It was through Destiny (and some gentle shoving by my other half) I was able to break down some of my social anxiety barriers. I wanted to finish the stories and in Destiny 1 the only way to do this was the raids. He asked his clan to help me, and they were all lovely guys and guided me through kicking the big bad guys butts! Yay more guardian friends! 

We were both very excited when Destiny 2 was released, he was very jealous I got to play before him as he was working. Again as in Destiny 1, we stood together our little fireteam of 2 and took down the cabal threat. I also started playing in the crucible, which I hadn't done in 1 as I didn't want to die continuously. I did pretty well and at one point had a better K/D score than my other half!
Fast forward through many DLCs and slowly but surely I started playing less Destiny, one main reason was I had a baby and didn't have the time or energy. However as I started to regain my freedom (aka the tiny human grew and slept through the night) I had evenings to myself and could build my Hunter back up and catch up with my other half. He however was starting to fall out of love with Destiny, it was getting very grindy and not really anything new to do. Forsaken came and it was awesome and it was like the good old days for a while but then it started to get stale again.

Skip forward to now, we have both just ground to a halt with Destiny. He's always got passionately annoyed at various points with the game along with the rest of the community and I told him to ignore the nay sayers and play because he enjoys it (like me). But now even I have nothing good to say. With short amount of free time I have, playing Destiny feels like a chore not fun. I'm ticking off bounties and not really gaining anything from it. Even in the last few seasons I could get my hunter to max light level and happily wait a few weeks before the next season. But now I don't even seem to be able to do that. There's nothing drawing me back, I'm just repeating old content again and again. Mindlessly shooting the same group of enemies over and over again seems pointless. There's not much story advancement, and by this point the amount of various bad guys we've killed repeatedly amounts to genocide. 

From my point of view, what Bungie are saying and what they are producing are very conflicting. It very much feels like the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. They say that the world of destiny is changing and evolving but I haven't seen that. They say we can play the way we want to but I feel like we're being forced to use certain weapons and play certain content. 

So it is with a sadness in my heart that I'm not going to be playing Destiny, we've had some good times but I just can't keep going like this. If anyone from Bungie reads this (I'm doubtful but you never know) please don't let this be goodbye forever, you have greatness in you and I know you can fix this. Much love from a hunter who is hanging up their cape.",3,1585655555,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsbko8/dear_destiny_its_not_me_its_you_we_have_to_break/,DestinyTheGame,1

fsbijq,Pwadigy,How Flinch Works.,"In reference to [this video](https://twitter.com/Banned_Wipe/status/1240419268161753094), he asks ""why"" at the end and I'm here to take this in good faith, because I'm Pwadigy and I selectively take questions in good faith if it means I can write an essay when I'm bored.

##(Why?) Flinch - HowItWorks:

*Don't worry, there will be a less technical explanation if you skip or skim through this section* 

Aimpunch (common: ""flinch"") pushes your reticle away from the direction of a combination of both the physical (X, Y, Z) coordinate of a shooter's hitscan and the direction from which the hitscan is occurring relative to the direction a player is looking. These two are mathematical opposites, and the final flinch vector is determined based on a sliding scale which rule takes precedent (and possibly by how much) at various angles that the engine designers chose.

The designers had to choose these angles because your reticle is a 2D point (X,Z) set at (0,0) on any given frame in your FoV which is determined by an angular delta over time for any given frame as your FoV changes (pitch, roll, yaw) to render the 3D space you see in 2D. As I'll soon discuss, there will always be problems when converting rotational deltas to cartesian vectors (which is essentially a huge part of what goes into the gunplay of an FPS game, which is represented to the player as a 2D plane where the 3D aspects of the game only become apparent to the player over greater simulated angular deltas over time (moving the camera)

The designers of Destiny's physics engine chose to produce the most accurate simulations of the directional aim-punch mechanic to be directly to the left, directly to the right, directly above, and directly below. Meaning that when you are shot from these angles with hitscan weapons, your reticle moves exactly in the opposite direction.

how does it determine flinch in between? some arbitrary oscillating curve calculated based on how far away from the most extreme angles from where you are, terminating at your reticle, the sine curve probably has an apex at 45, 135, 225, and 315 degrees in the two possible 3 dimensional angular vectors (these are either boolean changes where the game says ""you passed this angle, now we're calculating this differently,"" or they're flinch deadzones if the oscillating curve calculation is the case. Seriously, go test out flinch near these very specific angles, it gets weird. Yes, the people who built the engine had to determine where the most accurate angles would be represented in-game and yes, those points would could have been chosen to be anywhere. My theory is that Bungie's gunplay is tailored to console, where aiming is itself a polar coordinate input (moving the thumbstick), so if the game made it so that getting shot from an extreme angle were the least accurate representation of directional flinch, it'd be horrible. Honestly it'd feel horrible on PC too. Bungie uses a lot of aim-punch/flinch. Bungie does a lot of things differently, and it's because Bungie's modus operandi is to create gunplay that feels good, and for Destiny, which is widely lauded for its gunplay, Bungie made that decision here in some capacity. Bungie has always made counter-intuitive physics decisions to create intuitive active gameplay, and it's been that way since Halo CE. 

Ultimately, **The game is designed to make sense when you're actively shooting and playing with the guns** in pretty much every fashion. Which is the exact opposite of what you experience when you stop moving your character, and stop moving your reticle. And when you break-down a game-engine to its constituent parts, it will always fundamentally be nonsensical on some level. Bungie does a lot more with gunplay under the hood than other games, so there's a lot more to break down. And I could write upteen threads like this on a number of different firing mechanics and why they make sense at times and don't at others. **but basically, you could make so many clickbait videos about this game's gunplay** if you wanted to.

Anyways, **whenever you're turning cartesian vectors in n dimensions into polar vectors over time in n-1 dimensions, there will always have to be inaccuracy somewhere,** as players in [shooters where people have the work ethic to actually do the mental legwork of figuring out how the game works instead of posting a 1-5 minute video, found out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/5bjssa/final_post_to_clear_up_what_relative_zoom/). as you can see, there will always be inaccuracies in motion over time from different angular deltas, and whenever you're dealing with the conversion problem I mentioned above, you have to decide which angular deltas to optimize for. As you can see in that thread, the OP told the players in layman's terms what the most two extreme relative sensitivities were to simulate 2-D apparent vectors based on the two most extreme possible angular deltas a player could aim at on-screen. The result is that there was a number that was most accurate for angular deltas that were the least extreme, as that delta (moving your reticle) approaches 0 (infinitesimal motion) over time and the very edge of the screen.

The engineers had to make this same kind of decision when they wanted to decide what the player experience would be like when being shot at. Either way, there is a set rule, and it's **not ""the reticle move on target help bad player hurr durr.""** Which is all fun and games, until people like me get quarantined long enough to write enough words to overcome the vastly different size and access to an instantaneous platform that some players have.

##Layman's explanation with nerd rambling (thinking it out):

The above gives you the logic necessary to figure out the *why does it work that way* yourself in a fairly intuitive fashion. **But I did that for you.**:

The game wants you to feel the direction you're being shot from. Basically, this adds a sense of immersion when you're being shot from extreme angles, becoming more immersive when those angles are out of your FoV. Because your screen is 2D, and what your looking at (your reticle) is the least extreme angle possible relative to your position, the game uses the opposite. 

So there are two derived rules going on here:

1.) if you're being shot from a direction that's very far away from the middle of your screen (directly to the side), your reticle will be pushed in the opposite direction it's coming from relative to your physical position

2.) if you're being shot from a direction very close to the middle of the screen (near your reticle), your reticle will move in the opposite direction relative to the direction the shot is coming from. **this is what was tested in the video**. To better visualize this, think of the testing from a bird's-eye view

So, if a player is slightly to the right of right in front of you, what direction would the bullet be if it went past you after it shot you (what direction relative to where you're looking at is it shooting from). The left. What's the opposite of left? Right. What's to the right? The other player.

Repeat the above logic for every other direction, and you end up at a fairly reasonable explanation for why the game puts you on target when you're slightly away from a target.

**Now, the opposite effect:** The video obviously doesn't mention this because that'd be waaaayyyyyyyyyy too much effort, but if you're directly on target, and a player shoots you, your reticle goes off target. Specifically, up if you're on the same elevation. Why? Well, for all intents and purposes, you could just say, ""well it has to flinch *somewhere*, and clearly *somewhere* has to be away from the player's head if you're already on it. So this combined with the above logic tells you why the reticle moves towards a target if you're slightly off, and away if you're directly on.

For the purposes of explaining this phenomenon, you can just stop and be like ""up makes sense. Up is good. Up is love. Up is life. Up giveth and up taketh away.""

But why... up, the heretics ask? And thus Pandora's box was opened. 

you have to think a little deeper. In Destiny, bullets always spawn from a set point on a gun, and it's usually set as the end of the gun's barrel (remember that [infamous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef-I7zPirRU) where they proved barrel length affects damage drop-off). Where is the gun's barrel always going to be? Lower than the player's head. Where does that mean their shot is coming from? below you. What's the opposite of below you? Up. Where were you? **on their head**. Where are you now? **not their head**.

##getting more technical again

Now, what happens if you shoot directly at someone's gun? Good question. The answer is it doesn't really matter, but it's still a good question because the reason makes it a good question. To explain, the point at which the player's gun spawns a bullet is used for the purposes of flinch and damage drop-off. This point is discrete, meaning it is calculated to be infinitesimally small down to however small this game calculates location on a given ""tick"" (remember, despite the fact that this game on PC has an uncapped frame-rate, the game ticks at a rate lower than that, which, based on the results from previous and hilarious GPU-based physics glitches related to console coding where the framerate is always 30, it is probably 30)

And this is where it gets really fucky, because the game actually uses your reticle to determine whether you hit or not, and not the point where your bullet spawns. This is how it is in most games, and the resulting phenomenon when seen from an outsider perspective is called ""head-glitching"" in layman's terms. you see their head, you don't see their gun. They still shoot you. This is because the gun is ever so slightly lower than the scope. so slight it only matters in cases where you specifically set up a head-glitch and get a few pixels of total target area more than your opponent for headshot purposes, while also covering a few pixels of your shoulders.

In other words, to determine a hit, the gun is actually using what would be your scope. The reason it does that is because if it actually used the aforementioned point in space (near the end of the gun) to calculate a hit, your reticle would either be wrong, or the game would have to zoom you into the end of your barrel, or the game would have to zoom you into your scope, but then lower what you ""see"" to be lower than where your scope is at any point as you're scoping in. Now, none of these work in a hitscan game very well. Some games just use an extra check to see if your barrel is blocked behind something with in-game geometry and then instead sends your bullet crashing (planetside, for instance which is almost entirely projectile-based)

All that being said, you're on the same elevation. You get shot. This is where there's a type of singularity. You're technically looking in almost the exact same direction relative to where you're being shot from, almost completely cancelling out an entire axis. You're being shot from slightly below, so why not up? Perhaps there's some interaction in the engine between the two axes, and there's some ratio between the two in extremeness where one rule takes over for a certain direction. It's really hard to tell why. But again, ""why not up."" There could be all sorts of magic at work, such as the fact that the shoulders are not symmetrical, or the actual exact point you are shot at on your body (Doubt). But either way, there's very obviously a lot more logic to this system than watching a 1 minute video will give you. And honestly, there are just some things in an FPS game that you'd have to ask the designers about, and can't be inferred from what you can test and your knowledge of how FPS game engines work

##Getting more philosophical: is all the above a ""bad thing"" because it ""helps you out when you're off and hurts you when you're on""

Despite this phenomenon having a completely logical explanation, you might still feel like this is unfair. But there's an added dimension to flinch: you and your opponent aren't standing still in practice, and you can't predict exactly when the other player is going to shoot while you aim. Most importantly **moving your reticle to a target is something that happens over time** So, in other words, you're just as likely to be flinched off-target as you are to be flinched on target if you slide from one ""head's distance"" away from the head, to the opposite side of the head *if you view the enemy shooting you as a random event that happens at a given time.* Either way, flinch will add a layer of unpredictability...

...that is, unless you can predict when your opponent will shoot and at what point they will shoot at you while your reticle is moving, in which case you can make instinctual adjustments to your reticle the moment you process that you're being flinched. This is obviously not going to be something you practice, but in the span of hundreds or thousands of hours of gameplay. you are eventually going to subconsciously learn it, especially because it's fairly intuitive (again, this is entirely based on the very logical ""your reticle goes in the opposite direction of the direction the bullet is coming from relative to where you're looking).

##""Shut the fuck up pwad and tell me what to do""

So, you want to beat flinch in Destiny? You want to increase your skill when all these big name streamers say the flinch system is braindead no-skill?

1.) **move your reticle faster.** Because flinch is an event that occurs over time, logically no matter when your opponent shoots you, less flinch will happen, and you won't have to worry about any of this, because you'll be close to the direction you moved your mouse. **aiming faster takes skill**

2.) Focus more on the direction you're shooting, being confident with your shot, and trying to hit when you know you're on target. If flinch worked opposite of how it does in Destiny (The most extreme angles would be the least accurate representations of where the bullet comes from), the only difference is you'd have to over-shoot a little to compensate for flinch moving over the X axis whereas currently the game encourages you to undershoot. **knowing when the most optimal time to shoot as you move your reticle over a given distance and time takes skill.** Yes, it's different in Destiny than in some games, but it's simply the opposite.

3.) Aim towards the bottom of the head. In any game with flinch, aiming to a particular part of the head gives you some advantage in flinch compensation.

4.) Play the game more. Seriously, as you learn the patterns of when players shoot you, you'll just know when to shoot

##""what's the actual problem with revoker though, Pwad, come on, shit's busted""

1.) It's a 3.5x zoom sniper and is an aggressive frame. Aggressive frames have lots of range. The range stat determines how much magnetism your gun loses over distance. Most Aggressive frame snipers have much higher zoom values. Essentially, Revoker gives you all the advantages of a high-range sniper (which inherently can compensate for flinch more at distances than low-range snipers) and the FoV of a low-range sniper. 

2.) Usually, high aim-assist and low-range snipers (almost every sniper you have to make a tradeoff, even Revoker) are better at CQC sniping. An example would be twilight Oath. The reason for this is because aim-assist is the total amount of magnetism whereas-range is how much that magnetism changes. If you're starting out with high magnetism and going to low magnetism, the overall magnetism will make shots easier to hit in CQC compared to a high-range, low-magnetism sniper.

3.) But none of this matters, because flinch matters less the closer the target gets, because the target is larger compared to your reticle's flinch distance. So basically, in close ranges, revoker is still going to be pretty decent despite having a lower aim-assist stat than other snipers simply because it gives you a larger field of view.

4.) Primary weapons have too much damage drop-off. Almost all primary weapons become pea-shooters at long-range and that makes the sniper take less flinch (iirc). This is a recurring problem in Destiny when they make the killtimes slower, one hit kill weapons become better by virtue of having more time to set-up on players using primaries. Almost no game has as much damage drop-off as Destiny, and considering the pain-staking amounts effort the devs go to make the gunplay feel immersive, having a bunch of guns lose all of their stopping power at like 20m is just silly. Why? **because the game already has mechanics in place to balance ideal weapon ranges**. Literally part of why revoker is broken has to do with this. There are mechanics such as FoV reduction (zoom, which also gives the benefit of treating the target as closer, giving more magnetism, for each gun there is a sweet-spot for zoom) combined with aim-assist falloff curves and total aim-assist curves. In other words, Short-range guns are designed to be much **harder** to shoot at long range **compared** to long-range guns. When you make the guns **both** harder to shoot, and then don't reward the player skilled enough to still land those shots, you have a double-balancing. Also, it feels weird, because a lot of guns have drop-off in ranges where they still have magnetism, making them feel like they should be effective when they aren't (see: handcannons and some pulses). Would this lead to skilled players gravitating to guns that are better in Close-range? Yes, because they'd be able to out-skill the balancing mechanics. And apparently this whole thread was spawned because someone wanted to imply that the flinch-mechanic was ""no-skill""

5.) Revoker does a ton of damage to the body. What does this have to do with headshots? well, Revoker does so much damage to the body, you have to play around its bodyshot damage. You have a lot more to play around, and therefore the power of them being ADS is a lot more threatening when they can put you at one-shot even if they barely try. Ironically, this makes it more likely that you'll get headshot. I think this is a problem with aggressive frames in general. I've been an avid sniper since D1, and I've always thought there should be a hard-cap on body-shot damage, regardless of archetype. Aggro frames already have a balancing mechanic in place: they're incredibly magnetic at long-range simply because they have higher range stats.

6.) It bypasses the ammo mechanic on misses. Basically, either kills you, puts you at one-shot, or gives them their bullet back. Now, again, you have to play around that. You now have to play around the fact that you can't slide across a lane or bait out bullets by strategic peaking. Which again, ironically reduces your options even more, and makes it more likely you'll get one-shot.

7.)It pairs well with hardlight. And hardlight is a good gun because it functions how primaries did in the Vanilla D1 sandbox (less magnetism at range but can still-hit shots). [I already wrote a thread about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fl71m9/hardlights_prominence_demonstrates_that_over_the/)

##""Why are all the snipers hitting their shots all the time no matter what I do""

Well, the average player doesn't use all available motion mechanics in this game. Many players slow-peak into lanes, don't use radar-baits (confusing radars with slides and such), don't pop in and out of crouch to confuse radars.

The average player also doesn't coordinate with their teammate to set-up multi-angled flanks. It's really easy to hit a shot no matter what you do when you don't have to worry about anything in any other direction. You know how I just had that whole schpeel about how flinch works completely different directly to the side? Well, consider that a hint.

##Is there anything that can be done to make snipers in general less oppressive?

Yes. Add a scope-fatigue system. Add a debuff to ""target-acquisition,"" or ""magnetism/aim-assist) as you scope-in. Encourage players to spend less time playing the game as a magnifying glass simulator, and more time moving around and shooting. Reward players who scope in at an opportune time and get those ridiculously fast shots off.

##""Pwad, why was revoker a joke and now it's good?""

Why was No-land-beyond originally a joke and then ended up being good? Because everything else was nerfed due to community complaints and the never-ending tallest-poppy-syndrome of the masses paid off. Then the ammo economy changed and No-land went from really good, to unhealthy.

Idk, people, I played Halo where a gun was either good or it wasn't and it didn't matter because everyone used the same gun and if a gun wasn't good, you just didn't go to the place on the map where you picked it up. Imho, a gun is either powerful, not powerful or unhealthy for the game. I don't like the term ""overpowered"" because it's like ""more powerful than what?"" Something has to be the most powerful, something has to be the most rewarding for skilled players to use. I find that guns the community calls ""broken"" or ""overpowered"" can be categorized as ""unhealthy,"" or ""overused.""

My mantra is: ""Almost none of the actual problematic stuff in the game even has a killtime, so why are nerfing the stuff that have killtimes""

Revoker doesn't have a killtime. And it's not like any sniper we've had before. The lowest zoom scope of a highish range sniper in D1 was 4x, held by the calcutta LR2 (the sniper you got from the first mission as a hunter). Fun fact: I still have it equipped in D1.

In D1 they increased all the scope zooms at one point. But before that, No Land Beyond, Black Spindle, and Defiance of Yasmin all had 4x zooms. After, No Land and Calcutta were left. Honorary mention to patience and time, where they had a perk that reduced the zoom to 4x, but you had to give up snapshot.

Of those, only the exotics had snapshot.

Revoker has no trade-off compared to any sniper that's ever existed in Destiny at its FoV.

Good talk.

fsbc2i,ttrgr,"Flawless Teams as Raid Bosses - An(other) Idea How to Marry Aspirational Chase, Nightfall Farming, and Accessible Matchmaking","0. Trials needs to succeed at being the Pinnacle PvP Experience on par with Raids, a farmable Nightfall Experience for Top-Tier PvP Players, and an environment all players can queue into and aspire, without dread and hopelessness, to earn unique and wonderful rewards. Perhaps the solution is, in exchange for having their farmable Nightfall Experience, skilled players are asked to be explicitly the Raid Boss stopping players only at but always at the gates of the Lighthouse.

1. Flawless Rewards need to be updated to be exciting to chase for everyone. They are boosted to the following:

* Weekly Powerful Adept Weapon\*\*
* 1 Ascendent Shard
* 25 Enhancement Cores
* 50 of each Planetary Material
* 100 Trials Tokens
* 1 Pinnacle Exotic
* 1 Pinnacle Class Item

^(\*\*Adept Weapons are their own conversation about what they were in D1 (Elemental Primaries with Celerity, right?), why Bungie stopped them in D2 (Magnificent Howl was not Magnificent for the Sandbox), and what they would be like in the current sandbox (re: Ritual Weapon versions of existing Legendaries), and how Adept Weapons as a concept are the solution to Aspirational Rewards (Flawless Pit of Heresy should reward something better than the permission to buy a foam sword), but for now let's just agree they somehow exist.)

2. You can only go Flawless once a week, per character, like in Destiny 1. The very intense drive to reach the Lighthouse is no longer itself the thing we try to make a farmable experience. Aspirational Chases can't be Farmable Grinds. Like a Raid, it's done only once.

3. However, Trials needs to be both like a Raid, and like Nightfalls. Saint XIV, the one at the Lighthouse, is now available as a new vendor for you, offering the following in exchange for Trials Tokens:

* 00 Tokens: Passage of Dominance
* 03 Tokens: Enhancement Core
* 24 Tokens: Targeted Trials-Weapon Frame
* 24 Tokens: Targeted Trials-Armor Frame (58+ Stat Total)
* 30 Tokens: Enhancement Prism
* 300 Tokens: Ascendent Shard\*\*

^(\*\*That sounds like a lot, but that's the same as right now earning enough tokens to purchase 7.5 Vendor Packages from Saint XIV, so I figured that was a nice clean number.)

4. Passage of Dominance is the most effective way to farm Trials as though you would farm Nightfalls, so you can only queue in a Fireteam using the same Passage. The Passage is locked at 6 Wins and 0 Losses; neither counter ticks up; forcing you to always matchmake at the last stage of a Flawless Attempt, or other players running Passage of Dominance. Against other Dominance Players, you play a game of Pinnacle PvP, but against non-Flawless Players, you are explicitly the Raid Boss at the end of a passage. A unique cinematic could even play painting you as like Calus or Riven to that fireteam, driving home that feeling of being a Raid Boss.

5. Since Passage of Dominance is essentially asking good players to ""Be The Content"" in exchange for Nightfall Rewards, the currency needs to always be better than playing a regular Passage. Passage of Dominance rewards the following:

* 6 Trials Tokens on a Win
* 4 Trials Tokens on a Loss
* 1 of each Planetary Material per Game\*\*

^(\*\*Wouldn't it be nice if we earned Planetary Materials more organically through playlist activities...?)

6. Since Dominance Rewards needs to be better than Regular Rewards, those too are tuned. Regular Rewards are changed to the following:

* 1 Win Powerful Reward: Weekly Weapon
* 3 Win Powerful Reward: Random Stat-Armor (54+ Stat Total)
* 5 Win Powerful Reward: Random Stat-Armor (54+ Stat Total)
* 7 Win Powerful Reward: Weekly Weapon + Class Item
* 3 Trials Tokens on a Win
* 2 Trials Tokens on a Loss

7. Saint XIV in the Hanger will still sell regular bounties and Passage of Mercy / Ferocity even if you've gone Flawless. You can't earn Flawless rewards more than once, but this still enables you to Sherpa Fireteams.

8. Consider making Vendor Packages from Saint XIV no longer drop Armor. Armor for non-Flawless players drops as though it's Raid Armor, something only done once a week, offering more distinction between the Prestige of Flawless versus regular play without mandating mechanical advantages. Especially if something like Weekly Bounties also dropped Armor.

\---

X. Overall, this would slowly remove excessively skilled players from the low ends of matchmaking without hurting the platonic ideal of what it means to go Flawless. Your CammyCakes and iFrostBolts become the Raid Bosses, and you won't go Flawless without being able to get lucky against them; however, you only have to get lucky against them once, as opposed to 7 times in a row.

Y. The Raid Bosses will also be rewarded for acting as content for the Trials Weekend, where they could lose every game as a Dominance Team and still earn more Rewards than successfully farming low-skilled players. They are given a playlist where they can exercise being the best of the best of the best, and get more out of the game as though they were farming Nightfalls, while being positive contributors to the overall community's experience.

Z. Over the weekend the player population that earns the right to be Raid Bosses goes up, weakening that gatekeeper's position and giving all players hope as the weekend drags on, without mandating that we give easy victories to anyone. *You have to beat a Flawless Team to go Flawless, because they had to beat a Flawless Team to go Flawless.* Sherpas that enjoy their job as carries can continue to do that, knowing that that Round 7 will be the Pinnacle Challenge for them again and again, but without getting hammered by them the entire road down and thus convincing them to instead do recoveries, or worse.",2,1585654375,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsbc2i/flawless_teams_as_raid_bosses_another_idea_how_to/,DestinyTheGame,1

There has to be some incentive to finish a card in order to overcome the problem of top tier players resetting and bashing on 'casuals' just to farm tokens. Why not give out ~25 tokens to people who complete a card (even if that is 3 losses)? This would encourage the better players to keep playing a card as the bonus would make it more beneficial to finish a card instead of resetting.

In the case of people who would throw games for 3 quick losses, this would look terrible on their stats. They could even increase this bonus amount at different win intervals to negate this possibility even more. If there was extra incentive to going flawless (I'm looking at you adept weapons) along side this system I really do believe it would allow the average player to get balanced games more often and increase the number of players getting involved in trials.

fsajcv,Dante1776,Scaling light level brackets,"I searched alot inside reddit and the last piece of info is that shadowkeep changed the brackets from 5 to 10.

In order to understand what light level actually do when you are under-leveled (looking at your GM Nightfalls) i would like to have some info about those brackets.

Please correct me where I am wrong in game understanding.

Let's take the GM NF. Recommended light is 1060 and they start at 21/Apr/2020. By that time a lot of people who grind bounties and pinnacles rewards will be at 1010, the hard cap. With almost 3 weeks of grind i believe alot of players will be able to be from +20 to +30. There are going to be madlads who are going to be way higher and even reach +50 by then but they are outliers for me.

So from my assumption most of semi-hardcore players will be ranging from 1030-1040 light level including the artifact.

If i take the info i got from here and there that brackets now are divided by increments of 10 we have the following situation.

Players who reach 1030 maximum light will have opponents with swords near their names and deal less damage and receive more.

Players who reach 1031 up to 1040 light will have opponents with swords near their names and deal less damage and receive more BUT way better than 1030.

Players who reach 1041 up to 1050 light will have opponents with swords near their names and deal less damage and receive more BUT way better than 1040.

And last there are going to be some mad grinders who are going to reach 1051 and will have opponents with NO swords near their names and deal more damage and receive less. (i do not know about their sanity after all this grinding.)

So the vast majority will be at 1031 up to 1040 with each level requiring tons of bounties and grind. The million dollar question and the reason of this post is whether being ex 1035 is better than 1031.

Thank you for reading and sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes.

tl:dr for GM nf being 1035 will be the same as 1031 in terms of damage deal/received?",7,1585650361,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsajcv/scaling_light_level_brackets/,DestinyTheGame,1

It could be surgically placed within activities too really add more chase value to each activity.  Exotic emotes, ships, dungeons, finishers.

I’d imagine there is an average money per player spent at Eververse equation they have. I’m curious if they took that average number, added it to the season pass cost, what the new season pass price might be. Thoughts?

Also, imagine if Eververse/Tess became a Bungie Foundation vendor. Yes Tess would sell a select few really cool items, but 100% proceeds goes to organizations in desperate need of the money.

fsa70k,JingleMyBells42,A casual gets his PvP wings,"Up until earlier this week, I’ve been pretty strictly a PvE player in Destiny 2. That all changed when I was playing Iron Banner for Pinnacle Gear and realized that I wasn’t doing too bad in the Crucible! I decided that I would give PvP a bigger shot and picked up all the Crucible Pinnacle weapons that I hadn’t gotten so far (Redrix, Luna’s, Recluse, Mountaintop, and Revoker) so essentially all of them. I started playing in Comp and stayed up all night playing for 6 hours straight. At the end of it all I had my Recluse. I didn’t get to use it though, because I knew I should be using Beloved to get Revoker. I just got Revoker yesterday afternoon. I’m close to Mountaintop and I should probably have it done once Momentum Control or Mayhem are back in rotation. It’s been nice getting kills in Crucible for a change, and it’s not really because of the new Pinnacles in my arsenal (although they help out a bunch). I’ve legitimately been seeing an increase in my skill as a PvP player and it’s honestly quite addicting. I finish one match and I’m just itching to get back in. In conclusion, I guess what I’m trying to say is that I finally got good, and I’m looking forward to my Crucible experience in the coming weeks :) (Comp was soooo difficult with all the auto rifles though, but Randy’s is honestly a pretty good counter, just thought I’d share) anyways I’m out, later gamers 😎",28,1585648535,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fsa70k/a_casual_gets_his_pvp_wings/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs9zxo,TheseNewtsOnYourChin,Nightfall Strikes and an idea to reinvigorate them.,"I’ve recently been trying to think of ways that Destiny 2s core activities can become the main part of the game again. Go away from the wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle style we have at the moment. 

Also I’m in lockdown due to COVID-19 in my country so I have time to think about it. 

Nightfall Strikes

I think we can all agree Strikes can get stale pretty quickly. Now it’s important to have normal strikes for players as they go through the campaigns and that sort of thing. However, I have an idea on how to create a more end game version that improves on The Ordeal version of Strikes. 

Each Strike is now made up of 3 parts. Beginning, middle, end. 

Each of these sections are made up of a different part of a different strike. So for example, you may have the Beginning section of The Arms Dealer, middle section of The Pyramidion, and end section of The Scarlet Keep. Each of the sections would have their respective enemies, and on harder difficulties, different modifiers for each section. I’m no developer but I’m thinking something like a loading part similar to the infinite forest would be possible? The parts where to go between sections you have that triangle tunnel. 

Now this could rotate daily, bi-weekly, weekly, or be every single time you play it. Not sure, might be better weekly so that people can get used to which weapons they want to use and strategy for each section. 

This would make Nightfall Strikes more interesting and something teams can actually plan and strategise for while still being difficult and provide endgame rewards.

fs9z4b,GeminiTrash1,Bungie Please Reconsider Keeping Destiny 2 Free to Play. Free to Play allows previously banned players in free of charge,"Reposted because I messed up the title... 

I just want to make my case so please any who come by this post bare with me.  However on behalf of the New Lighters I do believe their time in Destiny should be honored, allow them to continue playing as they have.  

  Onto my case against Free-to-Play issue.  This primarily is an issue for those on PC,  Steam takes no Subscriptions and Destiny is free.  This means that any players who may have been banned may make a new profile and reinsert themselves into the game free of charge.

  Leaving the maliciousness of the grounds for the ban to the imagination of the reader, this invalidates the use of a ban for an entire platform. This is an issue especially given that Trials of Osiris has returned and bans are very import for the vitality of this competitive mode.  Evidence of this are the players with Barcode/Numbered Name Tags.  Throwaway accounts,  believe I wouldn't bring this up if it werent already being done. 

 TL:DR 

 I love the New Blood that New Light brought,  and I'd love for the new lighters to remain in destiny as they have been.

   HOWEVER bans need to have more weight behind the action than just making a new account.  Which takes 5-10 minutes. If Free to Play is abandoned previously banned players will need to pay actual money to enter D2 again.

fs9y2o,SiDthaKiD284,Faction Rally Armor,"TL;DR - I’m salty the Dead Orbit hunter cloak won’t drop for me and that I can’t just use the ornaments from collection. 

Correct me if I’m wrong since I’ve been wrong a lot. Part of the community was as asking for faction rallies to come back. Another part was just asking to use the ornaments that were already in the game on armor 2.0. Yet Bungie decided to make Faction Rally armor 2.0 with random stat rolls and no seasonal mod slots. 

If I’m correct on this, which I may not be, there is a huge disconnect. Since this season started all I wanted was a Dead Orbit hunter cloak. It has no stats, no seasonal mod slot but whatever I’d just use it for crucible. I’ve been playing this contentless season just waiting for RNG to drop me this cloak when day one of Shadowkeep I could equipped the ornament. 

I know the ship has sailed and they’ve promised we won’t see another season with faction rallies and that’s fine but guess what we will also never see? Another season of vex offensive, the sundial or these pepega bounty bunkers. I don’t even want faction rallies or these game modes to return. All I want is to use ornaments on my current 2.0 gear. What’s the point of playing a whole season to get the gear you asked for only for it to have to mod slots? Then if you run an exotic guess what?

Rewatching content from Rise of Iron, I think the Exotic perk that makes the most sense would be a ground slam AoE that creates a small DoT zone underneath it, not unlike the Code of the Devastator for Sunbreaker Titans but without the traveling line of fire and the tornado.

I just think that it's a weapon that would make a lot of sense for us to be reforging at this point.

I think the state of Destiny on PC is at its worse right now because of Hackers. With console we can eliminate that since console is harder to hack. The PS5 and Xbox will be able to run up to 120 fps and i think for bungie to use that opportunity and have the console players have the experience of playing at higher frames and better performance.",1,1585644589,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs9gyp/will_next_gen_console_save_destiny/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs940c,sygmathedefiled,Seasonal model is good but needs building on in the future!,"As I’m sure everyone here is aware this season has started off rather light in terms of content and there’s definitely more Bungie Could/Should have done to help alleviate the problems. 

My first suggestion is that each season should come with a new PvP map, Gambit map and a Strike that all fit with the theme/story of that season. This season’s strike could be about a Red Legion assault on Rasputin’s storage for the satellites we’re building to stop the Almighty or something (IDK, not a story designer lol).

Second of all, Strikes and Strike-Exclusive gear need an overhaul with more items being added to the pool (remember when we used to get multiple pieces per strike? (Weapons AND Armor) Pepperidge Farm remembers) this helps make the strikes actually replayable rather than people ONLY doing them for the milestone completion each week.

Third, and this is an important one, we need the PvP team to step up and make balance and other various adjustments MULTIPLE times per season. Personally I would aim for at least two (one with the start of the season and another midway) but would push for 3 until the Crucible is where it should be. 

Engaging Rant Protocol. 

Fourth. Now I know it’s gotta be hard for Bungie right now but this point worries me for the immediate future of this franchise more than anything and that’s Bungie’s desire to solo publish multiple games at a time. This leads me to assume that in some capacity they have other IP (Matter, for instance) that they are working on which is splitting their already dwindled workforce after losing some rather valuable support studios. I get what their goal is but I have to question management’s thought process here as it seems blatant to me that Bungie NEED all hands on deck in order to turn what we’ve had since Shadowkeep into something the players can be happy about rather than disgruntled. Basically there are too few eggs being spread across quite a few baskets right now when we have the live team making the seasonal content we’ve been receiving then you have another team working on this years comet, potentially another working on D3 and then you have other teams working on other IP at a time where they’re telling us things like “It was Ritual weapons or Trials...”. 

Disengaging Rant Protocol.

There are plenty more things Bungie could do to improve the flow of seasonal content and alleviate the content drought-like feels emanating from the community and these are but a few. What suggestions would you have for Bungie in order for them to target a stable amount of content per season that would keep players engaged and happy with more of the game as a whole?",0,1585642577,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs940c/seasonal_model_is_good_but_needs_building_on_in/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs8uff,JorsanToled,Bungie is back at it again,"If no one sees this then whatever. I’ve given up on destiny 2 entirely.

For reference I am a pvp player that would consider myself good maybe above average at best. Week one of trials was for the most part, a decent experience. Few people (at least that I faced) were way above my skill and power level. The map was great. And I had a fun time. Week two of trials was a nightmare. All people used was hard light and a shotgun. Who can blame them for doing it anyways. Because of poor map choice, all people had to do was spam corners with a 0.7 TTK auto rifle and no one could do shit. Then there was the damn awful matchmaking. My team and I weren’t even making it to 3 wins without losing 3 times(at this point I said fuck flawless). The only thing that happened that week was token farming at one win. It makes complete sense why people stopped playing that weekend. Week three(present). The worst map bungie has chosen. Widows court is a horrible map for pvp because there is no exceptions for anything but snipers. This problem is made even worse when you add a sniper that doesn’t penalize you for missing. The matchmaking is now at the worst it has ever been with teams still token farming at 1-3 wins(this is where low-mid tier players usually are). This makes teams that want to try trials out, quit in their first few games because they get stomped immediately by top-god tier players who farm and farm low level trials. This is by no means the players fault. This is the fault of a developer who clearly doesn’t know what the hell they are doing. 

The point that I am taking away from this is that unless bungie fixes something in this god-forsaken pvp playlist, they are going to lose a large portion of their playlist. 

P.S the most wins I got on a card this week was one. So now the 90+ tokens that I farmed for are gone. Fuck trials and that is for nothing bungie",3,1585641164,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs8uff/bungie_is_back_at_it_again/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs87ez,PixelRage92,How to beat FOMO with this game?,"I've been playing since launch and can honestly say i'm having the least fun i have ever had with the game, yet i feel forced to play it more than ever before. Usually, i'd smash out a seasons content over the course of a week or two, dip in every couple of weeks if there was some kind of update and enjoy my other games. However, since last season I've felt forced to at least play a couple hours a day to make sure i can keep up with the season ""Event"" that requires levelling up some pointless thing for pointless rewards. 

In regards to this season, i'm confused as to what I've actually paid for. The locations and content are all things I've already paid for that were in the game previously, save the bunkers and cutscenes and bounties shouldn't be the primary focus of the season. It's partly my own issue i will admit, but i feel like bungie have intentionally designed the game around a stressful rush to keep up with the ""content"" so even missing a day will harm my progress due to the way the bunkers are upgraded via bounties. 

I'm beginning to see the pattern that bungie have created and i want to break free from it, but i am heavily invested into the story more than anything, and i have anxiety about missing out on major plotpoints or events due to the new way things are. Before i would skip a season then come back a couple months later and have an expansions worth of content to get through. I did this from black armoury to drifter and it really helped me appreciate the game again. However, this isn't possible anymore and seems like its only gonna get worse and worse. Is there any advice on how to step back from the game? it honestly feels like a checklist of chores to do so i can spend time doing things in other games i actually enjoy yet i feel compelled to do it nevertheless.

fs8697,stilterfish,What if factions came back as a cash grab?,"Hear me out for a minute. 

We've got a weird disconnect where there is an impending doom as the Almighty threatens to crash into the city, and our best course of action is to mine crypto-currency by hand in the hopes that our warmind turns on the RGB and (maybe?) gives us a story related cutscene at the end of the season? We went from being these incredible godslayers in raids, to Private Errandboy, ""the world survived and I helped!"" And then to prove that we really are the hot shots we think we are, Tess will slide up next to us at the postmaster, slap the hood of a Dodge Charger, and tell us a big strong hero belongs in a space ship like this.

What if we brought the factions back, pushed some of the mindless grinding over to them, and then tied in the seasonal battlepass. There would be a reward track for each faction, grinding rep would determine what rewards were available, and xp leveling would determine how often you got to claim a reward. Faction vendors would get armor and weapons with weekly roll refreshes that could only be bought after the item had been unlocked on the battlepass. Our guardian's relationship with the factions would be that of a freelancer or lieutenant grinding out bounties or waging wars in grindy repetitive events (that had our unlocked faction gear added to the loot pools). There could be some lore or references to the meta-story and how the factions are responding to big picture events, but missing a season wouldn't cripple the story. For those with no desire or time to grind out three classes in each of three factions, but who just need to get absolutely everything, there would be some sort of paid levels mechanic to further line Bungie's pockets. 

I think this could make the seasonal pass a lot more interesting and a rewarding grind, while not taking anything away from the gravity of the developing meta-story. With a focus on monetizing factions, I'd like to see Eververse get a permanent haircut, pushing some of that loot, especially the themed items into specific activity loot pools.",10,1585637682,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs8697/what_if_factions_came_back_as_a_cash_grab/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs84xk,Kleindog12321,Bungie take a break with the seasonal content and fix the core game modes first,"Bungie needs to cut the seasonal track or take a break for a year or until they fix their base game, and this is how I think it can be done:

RAIDS
- add proper prestige modes that have new or uniquely modified encounters
- introduce new or modified armor for prestige that have a unique look and possibly a special perk, for instance having a full crown of sorrow armor set on allows the player to have more target acquisition with hive based weapons, would make raid armor have a higher value other than stat roles
- makes raid weapons feel special, for instance just add an intrinsic perk such as the garden of salvation weapons piece through enemy shields better(as many of the enemies have shields so it would make sense the the weapons get this intrinsic perk to make the, feel special)
- make old raids have purpose, possibly add a rotating weekly raid that grants pinnacle gear

STRIKES
- we need more depth to strikes loot, the new strikes in shadow keep are great, but useless
- possibly adding at least 1 armor and 1 weapon to every strike as a exclusive would be great
- bringing back the skeleton chest at the end would make a great addition, as I know people who have done 100’s hallowed lair strikes and have gotten barely any mindbenders
- each weapon or armor piece could also have a special well thought out perk such as wearing these titan arms and shotgun from a certain strike could allow you to get the traction mod built in for free in the mod slot on the titan mark

CRUCIBLE &amp; TRIALS &amp; IRON BANNER
- continue with the pinnacle weapons, just think out the perks better, such as a sidearm that gains higher rate of fire with each headshot or something even better as a good perk doesn’t need to up the dps of a weapon
- continue to balance weapons and keep sandbox stable, don’t let certain weapons stay overpowered
- refresh the crucible armor and weapons for god sake with new models
- make the armor be special, possibly an armor set for comp that glows brighter as you get closer to 5500, hell make it go to 10000 as a good way to show off your skills
- possibly make more weapon archetypes to spice up crucible 
- possibly have crucible weapons be special by making them have risk reward aspects, more headshot damage on a new 90 rpm sniper but it has less target acquisition or maybe a auto rifle that shoots 900rpm and has high dps compared to the normal 900rpm archetype of auto but it’s bloom gets larger as you shoot and doesn’t stop getting larger. If we are going to continue making damage perks they need to have a downside to them also to prevent power creep.
- trials needs to have loot for the casual and sweaty players, we need adept weapons with intrinsic perks as flawless rewards
- trials also needs the bounties that award armor pieces and weapons, to allow the casual player to get anything out of playing trials
- iron banner armor and weapons also need new and innovative rewards, possibly armor and weapons that revolve around team play
- iron banner is themed around us guardians as a pack of wolves working together to defeat our opponents, why don’t we have armor and weapons that compliment this
- a suggestion is to add intrinsic perks to the armor set that possibly have increased mobility while moving as a pack or a lone wolf perk that gives the player less recoil when away from their team or pack
- I feel that each pvp mode needs to loot to make it stand out from one another, as of right now armor and weapons are becoming redundant and useless and if each activity gives me armor and weapons that aren’t unique in some way then what’s the point of getting new guns or weapons
-fix the damn hackers 

GAMBIT
- I believe gambit is a great mode, just needs to be spruced up, better than jokers wild did
- make each gambit boss special with their own mechanics to improve involvement and stimulate strategy and learning of the new bosses 
- if gambit prime is going to stay then it needs to be more solidified as its own game mode compared to normal gambit, prime needs its own ranking system such as comp does in normal crucible
- make more special gambit prime armor that can be earned from playing gambit and not the reckoning, the perk system on the armor was very innovative and can be enhanced by adding more types or classes, such as the trapper, this type of armor set in gambit allows the player to send different types of blockers that annoy and possible trap the players more from across the map or while invading the trapper armor set allows them to set literal traps around the enemy teams map by spending their motes
- then such as my other ideas make weapons that have synergy with the game mode, possibly and perk in gambit that allows a sniper to have dragon fly and explosive rounds and knock back rounds only when invading, this would go nicely with the invader armor set
- possibly give the player and option to set their blockers, as there are three options of enemies for 5 motes that can be set before the game like kill streaks in cod
- for example at 15 motes the player before they enter a gambit game can set their 15 more blocker to and ogre or a cyclops or a group of 5 stronger than normal thrall, the possibilities are endless
- also who said it has to be 5 or 10 or 15 motes, over time bungie can add more enemy and mote combinations, such as 8 motes and you can spawn in two harpys 
- I believe the player could choose between three amounts of more before game for instance, billy can set a blocker for 3, 8, and 16 more deposits
- blockers could also have mote costs that could be used to make blocker Loadouts, as a thrall is 2 motes or a vandal is 3 and a player can set one of their three options to 5 motes and whenever they bank 5 motes and taken thrall and vandal pop out
- this blocker Loadouts would revitalize gambit and allow a greater level of personalization and option

I believe these changes to the core game modes area huge leap in the right direction for destiny, these are the permanent game modes and they could be and need to be so much better before bungie can cram in more modes that will disappear every 3 months.

fs7y3l,thanosthumb,Best loadout for legit Riven? (Season of the Worthy),"My team and I don’t do the seasonal cheese and with the nerf to snipers, Izanagi’s Burden is not as viable as it was for DPS phases. Most of the team runs Whisper now. I still use Izu because I am usually responsible for staggering her to reveal eyes and it does a damn good job with that. Plus I can use Delirium to clear ads and ogres up top and a stable auto rifle to shoot eyes.

We usually end up sending her to the Ascendant realm after the first wart phase or on the first floor DPS phase of the second round. I’m content with my loadout because I feel it suits my role in the encounter. But my teammates have been searching for better loadouts to do damage with so we can consistently get 1 round kills or beat her with the first wart phase. 

Does anyone know what is “meta” for DPS in this encounter now? We run Nighthawks for DPS but sometimes we have to use them for a stagger for various reasons. I’m sure Swarm of the Raven and Wendigo are good picks, but most GLs and RLs got hit hard with the auto loading nerf. Perhaps it’s something entirely different. That’s why I figured I would poll the community.

fs7p2y,Excalibur025,Authentic-ish Rasputin bunker code wallpaper,"TL;DR - Here's a wallpaper for your own personal warmind, hopefully accurate to what Rasputin might himself be calculating. [https://imgur.com/a/Fy1g0x0](https://imgur.com/a/Fy1g0x0)

I wanted to create a wallpaper mimicking the code that Rasputin displays in the planetary bunkers for my D2 themed PC build. When you travel to a bunker and zoom in on the monitors It looks random but I noticed sometimes you can find labeled encryption protocols (SHA384, Murmur2, Joaat PHP, etc) hidden in the random strings. They're displayed in normal text following a colon.

I did a little research and when you hear Rasputin's voice, it's actually Russian backwards. One of the lines he says is from Fodor Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov: *“There is no immortality of soul, thus there is no greater good. Therefore everything is permitted.”* 

To create the layers of ciphertext I encrypted that actual phrase in 10 - 15 different protocols and layered them in gimp. To finish it off, I wanted to have the commands at the bottom of the screen (like seen on Rasputin's monitors during the Xol strike) so I borrowed it from a terminal session of Nano in Debian. The lines and ACHII art are intentionally not centered as to add a 'continuous' effect when used in multiple monitors.

There is quite literally no reason every match I pair up with is against the cream of the crop. The top 5%’ers of TRIALS. That should be 1/20 odds that one of the slots on the opposing team is Diamond ELO. The fact that we came across every team with Diamond Trials ELO is poor coding. 

Separate flawless winners into their own toxic sandbag to fist it out over special ornaments, engrams, and intrinsic perks. 

They literally have no reason to go Flawless, let alone keep pushing their card because;

1. Connections are better for them at lower cards. 
2. Wins are easier for them at lower cards. 
3. Tokens are faster grinding at lower cards. 

What incentive to they have to chase the END GAME of FLAWLESS. Trials is and End Game activity where the end of it should provide the most pinnacle of loot. 

The fix?

A) Bring back adept weapons
B) Bring back attainable weapon bounties
C) Add additional value for Flawless players to carry out against other flawless cards for increased tokens, trials-centric top tier rolls, ships, ghosts, emblems, etc. 
D) Remove the barrier of 3 wins to use tokens FFS.",14,1585635065,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs7o49/trials_me_vs_every_diamond_elo_trials_players/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs7l65,ScleePrime,September 2020,"Every since D1 came out we as a community, have always been looking forward to that sweet September date when the new big expansion will come out and right all the wrongs and the game we’ve all been clamouring for will arrive.
(Yes I know shadowkeep came out in October, but you get the gist of it.)

First we waited for TTK to come out to finally give us all just something to do again, it was great.

But then it came out and like nothing else happened, anyone else remember that time from TTK until like feb 2016 when there was like no info on anything new, then they announced that April update.

Rise of Iron comes out sep 2016 and hey it’s not as big as the taken king was but we all know there working on D2, so whatever shortcomings it may or may not have, We cut them some slack.

D2 is coming out sep 2017 and man it’s going to fix everything hey, the game is going to be so legit, they have had time to listen to all the feedback the community had given them and the taken king was such a great game, D2 is bound to be the greatest.

It comes out and yeah we all know what happens, so once again we look forward to that sweet September date for the new expansion to right all the wrongs again, so out comes forsaken in 2018 with the seasons etc.

Then we hear the big news in early 2019, Bungie and activision split but bungie keeps destiny,
With all the rumours and massive articles over the years about all the tension and drama between the two company’s and the rebooting half way through development on both bloody games if I’m remembering correctly, then yes finally the big bad monster is gone.

Destiny can finally be free and truly create its own destiny blah blah blah all that crap, 
So it’s October 2019 and shadowkeep comes out with its season model again, and the game is what it is now.

I guess the point I’m trying to make of any is that every year we all look to the new content that will finally make the game what it was meant to be all along.

But it never is, I know I would always think things like well it takes time to get feedback in the game, I’ve heard the engine is just a difficult pos to work with and slow.
Always cutting them slack and looking forward to that sweet sweet September.

I have no bloody clue what’s going to happen this year, you hear the game is to large to add anything more into it, the talk of weapon retirement and all manner of stuff like that.
Are we getting a D3? Probably not but I’d assume some type of location change and that’s how they change all the stuff around, no idea it’s not my job to come up with this shit.

Yeah the game is boring and not super fun right now, and some of these problems just seem like common sense would help.

Like hey let’s maybe have some armour ornaments for flawless trials, have the pinnacle quests be for some vanguard, crucible and gambit inspired armour ornaments instead of weapons.

It seems easier to put those in game then design armour and weapons with rolls and perks since we have only one ritual this season.

I’ll be there for September 2020, I’m a fan and I started playing it when I was like 27, early 30’s now and I’ve got a wife and a new born and I work a lot more so the amount of games I play over the years has gotten smaller and smaller, but I always play destiny it’s the one consistent it’s my hobby, and some times I can only get on there like 10 hours a week and sometimes not at all, I usually try to take a two/ three week holiday from work when the expansion comes out so I can just binge and grind.

This September, with bungee being free for almost two years at that time, yes they don’t have the same amount of resources they use to but with all the feedback and with that time I hope they done what they say they’ve been doing and listening.
I have no idea what it’s going to be like, but if it’s just like D2 and repeats and sins of the past over and over then I don’t think I can look forward to another September anymore.

What's the point of this Survey?

I honestly don't know but the general idea is to see where you folks are getting connected so we can identify why all the network errors and issues are popping up after the season started.  It could be high ping or the game having difficulties maintaining a connection with the server cuz you got connected with a data center that is out of your regions. 

I should be connected to a European server because that region is preferred for Gamer in Southeast Asia but after monitoring the Remote address that you will find in the same TCP Connections tab i was connected in **Rio De Janeiro** that resulted in a longer match queue and lag during my playthrough.

It's also the third largest PC game.

For those of you that aren't sure, *that's too big.*

&amp;#x200B;

Shadowed only by Modern Warfare \[which recently got quite popular due to Warzone\] and Quantum break [\[ahead of it's time\]](https://db.destinytracker.com/d1/items/346443849-vex-mythoclast).

It's hardly keeping up in terms of gameplay quality, or appeal.

I know what you're going to say next!  

'If the game's so big, why am i logging in weekly to do

*the same shit over and over again?*

Often to little to no avail. It's no secret that players aren't feeling rewarded at the moment, which i feel is a branching issue. 

Bungie. Dropping trials, on a 165 GB game that's been suffering for years now. RIGHT at the start of a literal pandemic...

It was hardly going to go well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't enjoy playing the game as much as i feel i should anymore, and there are some major issues that have contributed to this general atmosphere of discontent within the Destiny community. 

I'm not a new player anymore, and it feels like the game is doing a poor job at mediating both the casual and hardcore playerbase to a point it's enjoyable for both. 

D2 Suffered from a rough start mainly due to the sandbox changes that came with vanilla D2, which essentially boiled it down to a teamshot simulator. Subsequent DLCS brought improvements that should have been added long before the releases, and only added to the dogpile of content Bungie already had on their plate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm gonna wrap this up by sharing my secret to enjoying the game in it's current state:

&amp;#x200B;

Don't! 

Nobody is forcing you to *try* enjoy a game that is very clearly on it's last legs. It was catered for casuals from the start, and&gt;! \[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrBHhyFy\_GU \] i'll be glad to leave it behind eventually.!&lt;

fs76k6,jinana04,Let's talk content.,"Before we start, this is my first post in this subreddit, so please be understanding...

Hi Bungo, you may have noticed that quite a few of us players are disappointed with the current season. Why? Well, there's a lot of bugs (definitely) and not a lot of content (kinda).

Bugs:
There are a lot of bugs, especially those related to our favorite animal, the beaver. I hope that these are fixed soon because it can be extremely difficult to play the game sometimes. I understand if the fix takes some time because of current events (COVID) but you guys at Bungie should try and make haste. There are other bugs that have been bugging players. Many players feel frustrated that a lot of bugs that were beneficial to us players, such as Symmetry's alternate fire having unstoppable capabilities, were being solved very quickly while others that were a detriment seemed to linger. For those detrimental bugs, many of us have brought up the bugged titan melee that you have forgotten about when we the players gave up reporting it. I am not a game designer and I do bot have any experience or knowledge  when it comes to these things so you don't have to listen to me on this one, but something like Rainbow Six's Operation Health might be nice.

Content:
The ""C"" word, content. To many of us casual players, there seems to be little good content this season. Trials of Osiris, something that even casuals should be looking forward to a little, has been proven to be a mode for only the sweatiest of players right from match 1. Trials seems to be one of the biggest parts of this season, but the majority of players will not be playing it. Nobody wants to be pub stomped by try-hards that are token farming. The PvE story content of this season breaks away from the Menagerie style activity that we had during the previous seasons. Good job Bungie! However, the fact that it is a public event in a public lobby can make it very frustrating. Currently, warming bits seem to be what people should be trying to get, and those seem to be acquired through Bounties. We've bad enough of bounties. Bounties have turned from a side quest to the main objective of this game, which has made the game less enjoyable to many players. I personally think that returning exotics from Destiny 1 are just fine because they are still new content in Destiny 2, as long as they are locked behind a somewhat interesting quest and/or activity. Also, the doing bounties/playlist activities for currencies to level up vendors located on different planets is a bit too similar to last season. Nothing seems to be innovative and fresh in Destiny 2 right now. No new strikes or raids, Trials appealing only to a handful of players, everyone else being subject to the same bounty grind we've had for seasons on end... Something needs to change Bungie. Also, Iron Banner has taken a huge hit. I've been in many games where it was a 4v4 and the lobby couldn't fill up. I was even able to go and make my self a sandwich while waiting to be placed into a match. 

The reason I put (kinda) next to content was mainly because there is content this season, but not much good content. This is what we've been getting : 
The bounty grind - Not Content
The Menagerie Styled Activity - Not Content (we don't have it this season but I'll still mention it)
Trials - should be good content, but it's not. Why? No adept weapons, token farming, cheaters (the team is working on it, I know, but it is still a big problem), connection issues, no real motivation to get Flawless other than a weekly ascendant shard and pinnacle gear (not that appealing), etc.
The Seraph Tower Event - Content, has a lot of room for improvement though
Ritual Weapons - would be good content, but we don't have anything this season. The Point of the Stag doesn't count because it is a part of the Iron Banner quest-line that is needed to turn in tokens
Grandmaster Ordeal : hasn't released yet, but I think that it will only appeal those who want the seal. Modifiers like Match Game or Extinguish just make the game annoying and not enjoyable. I doubt people will actually enjoy this mode.
Exotic Catalysts - Lumina catalyst was nice, but any others? 
Exotic Weapons - Tommy's Matchbook and Fourth Horseman were great. Heir Apparent is TBD. (Exotics, although content, don't last long)

This is all I had to say. I'm probably terribly incorrect/mistaken about many of these things, please let me know. I've just been frustrated about how this game was going, especially because I've really enjoyed this franchise since Destiny 1.

fs6q6p,harbind2,Trials for Casuals,"I posted it yesterday, but it got removed. So here goes again. 

I made a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fnlnis/focused_feedback_trials_of_osiris/flaxedh/) about this. Like that post, this'll be long and will have a tl;dr at the end.

The goal here is to identify what pushes out players, stem skill creep, and entice new players into the gamemode. 

#Skill Creep

Over the last few weeks, Trials has become noticeably harder as a result of skill creep. It's still possible for above average players to reach Flawless, but it is not difficult to predict that this will soon not be the case. 

Players bleed out of the system. This isn't exclusive to Trials or any other game mode. There will always be a degree of attrition that occurs just by people trying it and deciding it's not for them. The goal is to invite as many people in as possible, and make a convincing argument that this is worth their time. 

But Trials is experiencing what I would call a hemorrhage of players leaving, a veritable arterial explosion of angry people. I've seen a lot of complaints, and I agree with them.

 * Players are not having fun or learning.
 * Incredibly skilled players spend much longer in the population, and are likely to run multiple cards.
 * Farming the mode is the best way to get tokens, but also a byproduct of how difficult it is to get flawless.
 * The rewards are not good unless you specifically exploit the system and control what drops you receive.
 * Casual players are a necessity to the gamemode, and serve as a topsoil in this dustbowl.
 * Said dustbowl is only going to get worse.
 * The mode was made for streamers/recoveries (Twitch quest rewards, carries, etc.) which do not help the population, and instead detract from it.

I'm going to try to tackle these in the hopefully easiest possible way to implement, and try to reuse the mechanics of other seasons when any are mentioned.

It's obvious changes, whatever they are, need to happen as soon as possible. My suggestions may seem over the top, but in my opinion, only consistently rewarding people who try will allow the game mode will continue. It *will not* survive as is. It will become a locus for cheaters, recovs, and the .1% that can compete against these. (And the occasional newbie team to wander in.)

There was another excellent post by /u/ascendantnomad , but I disagree with the conclusion of the post. Increased tokens on wins only still punish the lower levels, and suggestions from streamers should be taken with grains of salt. 

I propose treating Passages as Raids.

You can do each Passage for the rewards once. These rewards are heavily increased, but once you go Flawless with each passage, you are no longer capable of playing Trials for the weekend. You've won this game of virtual capitalism, and should move on. (Recovs should be pursued and taken down.) The alternative to this is that those that go Flawless have SBMM applied, or they are placed into queues exclusively with other Flawless players.

This one-time Passage allows for extremely skilled players to go through their 33 matches be rewarded, and exit the pool. This hurts streamers, but they'll be rewarded heavily for going flawless 5 times a week anyway. 

Each Passage would be changed under this system. Bounties should be relegated to side objectives, not farm ones. Each passage would chain into the next, particularly for casual players, encouraging them to continue to play the game, and earn their weekly rewards before cashing out, even if they can't go Flawless. 

The Lighthouse should never be too far beyond the horizon that casuals can only see it through the shoulders of giants.


#Passage of Mercy

**Objective:** Casuals should feel the incentive to continue rather than give up. They should continue playing to unlock the other passages, and if they reach wins with losses under their belt, they want to queue up again rather than reset and retry.

The Passage of Mercy is changed so that it has 3 Mercy losses. Once you lose each of those, your passage is broken.

Each win grants 10 tokens, and each Mercy grants 5. A Flawless gives 35, with any tokens remaining from the Mercies.

**Total:**

120 Tokens, 3/5/7/Flawless rewards, 1 Ascendant Shard

6 packages from Saint-14, 4 from Weekly, 1 Ascendant Shard

Passage of Mercy should be ""Baby's First Flawless"" even moreso than it already is. You should feel heavily incentivized to give it a few shots, even if you lose once or twice halfway through the card. People who can only achieve 1-3 wins before dropping out get anywhere from 20-45 tokens. 

---

#Passage of Ferocity

**Objective:** A Win-more card. If you're good at the game, you can get to the Lighthouse incredibly quickly.

Passage of Ferocity is changed so you need to win 4 games to go flawless. Every other game you win gives you an extra win. There's a catch. Your matchmaking is adjusted so that you're up against people who are at the Lighthouse Gates for the duration of the Ferocity run. How lucky/good do you think you are? This is probably too complex, unfortunately. Design-wise it's harder to volunteer information on this without making sweeping changes. 

---

#Passage of Wealth

**Objective:** A chase goal for casual and great players alike. Players cannot expect to go easily flawless, but the rewards along the way are excellent, and people who get 3 wins feel like their time has been spent well.

The Passage of Wealth is changed so that each win grants 20 (+10 for each win) tokens, and 10 for each loss. It unlocks on 1 win.


Wins | Tokens | 
:--|:--|
1 | 20 | 
2 | 30 | 
3 | 40 | 
4 | 50 | 
5 | 60 | 
6 | 70 |  
7 | 80 |
F | 90 |
L/B |10|

**Total:** 470 Tokens 

23 packages from Saint-14

Even players who don't do well are incentivized to enter and play to the best of their ability. 1 win, 3 losses, is still 2 packages. 3 wins, 3 losses, is 6.

---

#Passage of Wisdom

**Objective:** A move away from season pass level farming, (which should occur by playing anyway) and a move toward more tangible rewards. Weapons and unlocked armor drop from this, incentivizing people who have unlocked the armor to pick this passage up, and for those that don't have it, to try to unlock it weekly. 

The Passage of Wisdom is changed, with 5 tokens per win, 3 for each loss. In addition, weapons and unlocked armor drop from each win and loss. It unlocks on 3 wins.

Wins | Tokens | Weapons | Armor |  
:--|:--|:--|:--
1 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | |
2 | 5 | 1 Random Weapons| |
3 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
4 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
5 | 5 | 2 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
6 | 5 | 2 Random Weapon | 2 Unlocked Armor |
7 | 5 | 3 Random Weapon | 3 Unlocked Armor |
F | 5 | 3 Random Weapon | 3 Unlocked Armor |
L/B |3| 1 Random Weapon ||


**Total:** 49 Tokens, 15 Random Weapons, 11 Unlocked Armor Pieces

2 Packages from Saint-14, 26 drops

Again, players who go 1 and 3 get 4 weapons out of it. If they can get to 3 wins, they get 6 weapons and a piece of unlocked armor.

---

#Passage of Confidence

**Objective:** True ""Hardmode"" Flawless, appealing to the best of the best. The rewards come from the Flawless chest. Casuals should still be encouraged to try for it, and be rewarded for trying, but the big rewards are locked behind the Lighthouse chest. Unlocks on 7 wins.

5 tokens per win, 3 per loss. 

**The Flawless chest drops:** 300 Tokens, 5 Weapons, 3 Masterworked 65+ Base Roll Armor pieces, 3 Ascendant shards

I would prefer it if the Eververse ornaments had a chance to drop from this chest, along with other ornaments for the armor. In fact, I would love it if there were official tournaments each season where the winners chose a weapon each to receive an Osiris-style ornament next season. But these are suggestions that would even less possible than what I am recommending, and I'll include more suggestions in my next section.

---

#Other Suggestions

1. All weapons should, by default, be in the random drop/package pool. 

2. Each week, weapons/armor should be *on rotation*, where you unlock the ability to buy Forge style bounties to make/purchase them. 

3. Armor should not be added to the drop pool after being unlocked, because getting your 4th or 5th class item in a row is not fun. (Or just allow for Armor/Weapon random package selection.)

4. Armor should drop at a *minimum* of 60. 

5. Gatekeeping people from the Lighthouse should be entirely removed. Elitism has no place when trying to resuscitate a dead/dying gamemode. 

6. Account Recoveries should be pursued and shut down. It's not healthy for the gamemode.

7. Introduce ""Adept"" weapons as weapons with 2 options for Weapon Traits, making them more flexible and having increased potential for a godroll. Don't enlarge the perk pool to ""compensate"" for this.

8. Make snipers vulnerable to flinch.

9. A Trials armor ornament for each different Flawless passage. Arms for Mercy, Chest for Ferocity, Head for Wisdom, etc. 

#Conclusion and tl;dr

People shouldn't be afraid to step into trials, even if it's to lose. They should feel like it's worth their time. Even if they get stomped, they got something out of it and can go away happy. They'll show up next week, and the week after that, even if they can only get 3 wins or less. That makes the overall pool of players healthier, which enables these people to also win more often. And even if all they do is lose, lose, lose, they *get something out of it*. They are encouraged to unlock the other Passages, just to lose there! The people who can win win win are rolling in loot, good for them, but the casuals will keep playing. Maybe they'll try for Flawless. Then work on it again the next week. And the next. 

**tl;dr:** Make people feel like their time isn't a hopeless soulsucking hole. They need hope, or at least to be paid for their suffering at more than pity pennies per loss.",2,1585630510,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs6q6p/trials_for_casuals/,DestinyTheGame,1
fs6lzq,CaninesDen,"Titans have been screwed over, and I’ve had it.","This discussion comes from hours upon hours of crucible, PvE, and overall playing the game as a whole.

Titans have become obsolete. Since the start of Shadowkeep, I’ve been really susceptible of Titans and their abilities in the game. But these last two seasons really put the nail in the coffin. 

Let’s start with basic class abilities. In D1, Titans had the Twilight Garrison; an exotic chestplate used to dash in and out of gunfire. Transitioning to D2, Warlocks randomly got it through a class ability of Icarus Dash. Granted, it was annoying, but no big deal. However, warlocks also have a healing rift. It basically outguns almost every fight as they regenerate health. Hunters have a dodge that they’ve had since D1. Yes, it’s old, and yes it’s not really a new ability. However, it immensely helps them in gameplay. From this, they can go invisible, jump high to add a dimension to the situation, and throw smoke to disorient enemies and inflict damage. 
Regardless, these are all really cool abilities

Now, what do we Titans get? A wall that can be jumped over and melted by gunfire. Need I remind you, our other smaller wall got nerfed. The only amazing thing we had (ability wise) got taken away from us. At this point, we’re going into Season of the Dawn. I’m hopeful for Titans. I’m looking at the reveal trailer, and warlocks get a super cool melee ability. Warlocks also received a buff to their “Flames Rise” perk whereby they have increased resilience and accuracy while shooting when the perk is active and in air. 

I didn’t include Exotics because I’m talking about class abilities only. However, if I were to include them, I’m positive that other classes would have the upper hand.",26,1585629961,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs6lzq/titans_have_been_screwed_over_and_ive_had_it/,DestinyTheGame,1

But, I was dragged into destiny back in late 2016 with my 2 friends, they wanted me to get the Destiny 1 collection that had all expansions and DLC n such, well I got it after a month of begging to my dad (I had no job and had no motivation to get one at the time) And well, it was just me and my 2 friends, later on it went from 2 to 4, 4 to a full raid team. And my god the memories of D1 was amazing, I managed to do all the raids and 1 in hard mode. I done all the strikes and got some exotics that I will always love, like the khostov (I think that's how you spell it) and that AK 47 thunder rifle (Dont know the name). Well later on in mid to late 2017, life was kicking my ass and I had to sell my console my tv and some books to move into a rent a room with my sister. It later went onto an actual apartment and after that I found a sustainable job, so I bought everything back and I bought D2 deluxe edition. I got in contact with those 2 friends after a misunderstanding that had happened and I was given an apology even though I didnt need one, I understood and was use to it. We later went to play D2, old group dissapeared or went to play other games. And 1 who I'll miss and will still be hurt was a dude named TheIronLord. He went on to battle royal games n such and blocked me and my 2 friends due to not talking to him or playing with him. Well me and my 2 friend still played on up until forsaken  they dipped and I tried to leave the door open for them to join back. They never really did... said they just dont like destiny anymore and that at that point it was just a cash grab... well I dipped too. I later started playing D2 when shadowkeep was released and I was the only one playing from my original group. 1 said he was thinking about joining me again and buy shadowkeep while the other said he will wait for D3 to come. I played through the first season battle pass of D2 and tried to love it but it just hurts knowing this is how it will be for content release... and hearing how Bungie is keeping story locked behind a paywall and some reskins of guns and poorly balanced guns n such was thrown into the update just made me drop ship completely.

fs6ddx,sageofthesenpai,Why I refuse to stop playing destiny 2,"This might end up long so I'll just start with a tldr saying destiny gave me my life back, that being said here we go. I remember when d1 came out and my friend said he would get me a copy and i was so happy that the creators of the games that I loved way too much at the time (cod and halo) were working together to make a game that's a shooter with fantasy and futuristic tech. What more could I want, but for d1 it didnt stick with me because our schedules never fit together to play and yes I know people like d1 more than d2 but this isn't about that just stick with me here please. About a week before destiny 2 had a trailer I had thought of jumping into d1 again because of all the good gameplay I had seen but then I saw the trailer and I knew this was my time to try destiny, I'll play it when it comes out and be right up there with people and the day it came out I didnt have money for it so I was going to say eff it and well I did. But just after the first raid dropped my beft friend was asked by one of the people who he was playing with ""do you know anybody who could join us next weekend? We need a 6th to replace who we were going to have with us."" And he told him that I was good and the next day he brought me down to gamestop(gamestop is going to be mentioned a few times just a heads up) to get a copy and the man behind the counter was one of the people I'd be raiding with and the two of them bought me the game and the both of them and the other members of the would be raid team helped me learn the game and while I was on by myself I grinded my self up to the max. We raided and raided and raided for months and finally they asked because I had mentioned it randomly hey do you wanna play magic sometime? I was puzzled because I knew that my best friend and the guy behind the counter at gamestop were local obviously but it turned out that 2 more of the guys were local and we met up and all played magic together. Flash forward a few months I needed a job and they helped me get one at that gamestop, flash forward to today I'm not with gamestop any longer and I'm still friends with everyone from raiding on that fateful day, as a matter of fact they've helped me sort some things in life and I'm going to be a groomsmen along with the rest of our fireteam to one of their weddings. I am proud to say that destiny has changed my life and no matter what happens to the game and how much I may not be happy at the state of if at a given time I will continue to play.

fs5qay,Nootherids,Should Bungie Just Come Out And Announce They're Working on Destiny 3?,"There are games out there whose existence have been made public years in advance before release. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Metroid 4, Destiny...... ! I am of the opinion that if the community was made openly aware of Bungie refocusing its very limited staff to a better and improved Destiny 3 in a timespan of 12-18 months then the community might be a lot more understanding of the shortcomings of the Seasonal model.

As it currently stands we started this year understanding that Bungie had a large gap in resources to work wit,  but with enhanced levels of creative autonomy. Everybody's response was positive and supportive. And in response for some reason Bungie switched from ""hard times ahead"" to ""we're here to give you everything you want"" type of marketing. With that rhetoric, the community is justified for having high expectations and being sorely disappointed. And being that we know that Bungie is in the works for developing another game (whether it's D3 or something else) leaves us a little bitter that we are getting shorthanded while something else is going on, making us clearly feel as a secondary focus for Bungie.

My opinion is that IF Bungie is working on a Destiny 3 with a limited but skilled staff, and still supporting D2 live with an equally or more limited staff, then the community would actually be a lot more understanding and optimistic. People would not be crying over $10 expansion packs. I mean seriously, it's just $10. (It's literally the cost of your Spotify membership for just one month which is far from a necessity of life; but Destiny at least brings entertainment, a social environment, and a break from everyday life for 3 months.) And people would understand why content is somewhat dry. We seriously have to admit that even though the content is not exactly engaging, the new modes are incredibly designed as you could only expect from Destiny. Beautiful worlds, great gameplay, creative mechanics, etc; but it's still missing in the engagement aspect. If we KNEW that Bungie was hard at work on Destiny 3 I have a feeling that the community would be much more forgiving than it currently is.

Now I do understand that Bungie may not want to reveal such a development for fear of much of their player base just saying they're done with the game until D3 comes out, and Bungie missing out on all the very necessary revenues from micro-transactions that it receives and is likely the only thing truly holding it afloat. But let's be real, the people that both play and complain about Destiny today will most likely also be the ones that continue to play Destiny whether or not a D3 was around the corner. I make the assumption that most of the people that pay real money in the game likely play this game exclusively over all others, and the knowledge of a new game wouldn't change that one bit.

I know I played D1 exclusively as my only game for 2 years straight. The yearly DLC costs were very welcome since $60 once a year saved me $100's from having bought other games throughout the year. Yet there was nothing to play ""for"", no grind, no titles, pretty much nothing...other than just enjoying a great game. And that used to be good enough. So it remained my exclusive game. I think Bungie in their attempts to get overly complex and unnecessarily creative has already ruined that kind of appeal. But the formula stands that the now exclusive players would continue playing and supporting Bungie exclusively all the way to release of D3 regardless. So, IF they are working on D3, I think it would be a smart move to come straight out and let the community know. Like, now!

fs5hmc,Fahns,Mod Components need to be usable for something else.,"They are very useful for new players who are catching up on their mod collection but for someone like me who has every purchasable mod they don't mean a thing. I'll need maybe 60 mod components to purchase the seasonal mods that aren't a random drop this season and unless the other season is much different I'll just continue accruing them for no benefit.

My first proposal is simple, Banshee-44 should sell one upgrade module for his usual 1 Core, 10 Shards, 25 Materials, and 5k Glimmer; and another upgrade module for the same price except sub the 1 Core for 50-100 Mod Components.

The second proposal is to allow us to spend them to reroll weapon masterworks. Not sure what the right price is as I have ~750 at the moment, but I imagine there's plenty of players out there with a few thousand Mod Components just taking up space.

Between Mod Components and Telemetry there's two gunsmith materials that are horribly underused and I hope this is addressed as opposed to Bungie just removing them and not taking any creative steps to solve the problem.",8,1585625112,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs5hmc/mod_components_need_to_be_usable_for_something/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs5eum,LiLMosey_10,Suggestion(s) about the enhancement system,"Theres something that has been bugging me lateley. I have well over 15 enhancement prisms. ""Thats great! Now i can masterwork my armour! Oh wait... I dont have any more enhancement cores to upgrade my armour to the point where i can now use my prisms."" So what now Bungie? The incentive to go and do spider bounties and gunsmith bounties isn't there, ESPECIALLY for the spider bounties. The gunsmith sells ONE, yes ONE enhancement prism for 10 CORES plus shards, glimmer, AND planetary materials. We also need to spend our cores on upgrade modules! Im not saying that is a rip off as you can easily farm them (prisms) in nightfalls, same can be said for the cores. But what if i dont want to do 970 nightfalls and i only want to do 1000 nightfalls? 1000 nightfalls dont drop cores so that kinda sucks, so here is my suggestion to provide players a better way to earn enhancement cores.

&amp;#x200B;

1- Give us a system that lets us DISMANTLE our ascendant shards into prisms, dismantle our prisms into cores, and our cores into legendary shards. It costs 10 PRISMS to get an ascendant shard, so if we want, why not let us dismantle our shard into 10 prisms? even dismantle into 5-8 prisms would be great! Same goes for the prisms into cores! I personally have absolutely no cores left but i have so many prisms! Bungie, why not let me dismantle some of my prisms into cores! im not going to write it again, but same thing for cores into shards.

2- Other than doing bounties, there is only a limited way to get cores. Crucible resets, using finest matterweaves, and nightfalls. There has got to be more. I cant sit there for hours on end playing the exact same 970 nightfall over and over again just for a few cores per run. Sometimes, you dont get ANY per run! Why not add them into the loot pool for 1000+ nightfalls as well?

&amp;#x200B;

There isnt really any other activities or things to do to get ascendant shards, prisms, and cores. Personally, I would LOVE for suggestion 1 to be implemented into the system as it would save me a lot of time and it would allow for me and im sure for many others to balance out their inventory with their ascendant shards, prisms and cores. Nobody will ever have too much of any material and allowing us to dismantle would mean that not only can we get what we need, we also wont be gaining anything as whatever we dismantle will ALWAYS have the same (or possibly even less) value than it did before. I really hope bungie sees this and if they dont, I really hope that there are some other people out there who agree.

fs578w,derosenb,Eliminated Persistent D1 Marionberry (PS4) by Downgrading Internet (Comcast),"TL;DR - Eliminated D1 Marionberry errors at sign-in by removing BLAST Pro internet speed upgrade with Comcast.

...

About a year ago, I started getting Marionberry errors any time I tried to sign in to Destiny, before even getting to the character select screen. None of the solutions I found online (change NAT, change DNS, hard-code IP, clear cache, forward ports, enable UPNP) helped. I even spent 30 minutes trying repeatedly to log in, in hopes of finding a stable connection by chance. No dice.

Then a few days ago, I moved. And suddenly I was able to log in to D1 on the first attempt. So, what exactly changed?
- new physical location (1/2 mile from old place)
- new construction (vs older apartment)
- longer cable(s) from router to PS4
- removed 'BLAST Pro' internet speed upgrade

Other external changes:
- national infrastructure changes due to COVID-19
- Bungie server changes (PC only?)

What's the same?
- PS4 and network settings
- modem/router and network settings
- ISP

I can't imagine the external network changes would have helped my connection, but I don't know enough about large scale networking to have a good intuition for it. The new physical location shouldn't have an effect, as I encountered no other network issues at the old apartment. And there's no way a longer cable route gave me a better connection. No way.

Unless any commercial networking experts can explain otherwise, my best guess is that removing the speed upgrade from my internet plan fixed the Marionberry issue. Why? How? Haven't the foggiest. But with Comcast I've come to believe that anything is possibl(y a problem). If you're really pining for some D1, and are having the same Marionberry problems, this is at least one more thing you could investigate.",3,1585623890,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs578w/eliminated_persistent_d1_marionberry_ps4_by/,DestinyTheGame,1
fs56d0,INikooI,Should everyone get everything in this game?,"As I was going thru this reddit I kept on seeing how people mention how some things are out of their reach. One example is items in Trials and Competitive playlist. Other one was about people talking how Y1 Ib armor ornaments should come back.

In my opinion, everyone should not be able get everything in this game and some items should be hard to get. There is not many things that are really rare or take skill to get to. This game need more (even few) items that are hard to get and cannot be acquired by everyone. 

 Im tired about everyone having almost everything: new exos, probably will get them in the first month they appear. Quest are usually really easy to do (leviathans breath, devils ruin). 

-Those Iron Banner ornaments? You had to be there, they are valuable only because people cannot get them anymore.
-Items in Competitive playlist are valuable since they are good guns and because they take skill to get (unless you paid to get them or something similar)

This game need something that a. takes skill to get or b. because they are rare. I get it, IB ornaments look cool as hell, thats why I use them. I also get how some people don't have the skills to go and play comp and get the stuff, but you can learn, and eventually get them. 

Im mainly a PvP player, and I would like to get Raid exotics like Tarrabah and SoTP exo heavy but Im not going to be getting them since I don't play raids alot. And it's okay, I can use other stuff. Congrats to those who have those raid exos, I only have 1k voices:D

You can hone your skills in PvP and get those Competitive weapons. And you will feel good when you finally get those! You can do it! 

And those who missed some stuff in Y1, sorry but you might not be able to get those items. 

tldr: people have been discussing/complaining how some items seem to be hard to get or cannot get anymore. In my opinion there should be rare items and items that take skill to get that not everyone has. And if Bungie makes everything really easy to get I dont think it will be good for game. Destiny is a looter, and if everything is handed to us it takes away the value of items.

There are weeks worth of campaign missions and loose connected planetary missions that tie into those campaigns. 

Why not give us 1,000,000 XP for playing through a 4 hour campaign, instead of spending that same 4 hours in lost sectors on the moon grinding bounties? Also, why not give us a few upgrade materials while you're at it? You already have a planned update coming later this month to revitalize pinnacle power game-play loops and upgrade material loops as was outlined in a TWAB a few weeks ago. 

You have the analytics, see what makes sense. If you see it take the average person 8 hours to complete a certain campaign, and 2 hours to complete a different one.. do what makes sense, and provide experience and rewards accordingly so as to not create more problems. But, if people were playing through the hand-crafted story-lines you created, would that really be a problem? There's a giant chunk of the game you said wasn't going to go anywhere, the old campaigns. Let's see them get more use.

fs4gyb,ToFurkie,The Token System is a Problem,"Tokens are why I believe Bungie made it so in Trials, you had to win [x] games to get the item before you can get it from Saint-14's packages, which is why people stay within the least wins possible once they unlock the item they want in the loot pool to minimize RNG. It's why I believe Bungie implemented the universally hated IB quests so people couldn't just buy the IB armor with tokens they've amassed over countless seasons. It's why Strike and Crucible loot feels so mediocre as a reward because any new item in Zavala and Shaxx's loot pool can be bought with tokens hoarded over months and years

Fundamentally speaking, tokens are much more player-friendly than D1's reputation system as you don't stop earning tokens when a package is available (unlike reputation progress), and you can use tokens on any character you please, whereas progress made in D1 is only for the character you played on. Hell, in D1, people loved when you could use planetary resources to progress reputation, which is basically a token system but more roundabout

#**The Problem**    
Tokens create a problem where you can hoard them, creating an issue for Bungie where hoarded tokens took away incentive to play the activity to get new loot because they can just buy it, thus leading to Bungies various ways to curb token farming for rotating activities (Trials, IB, and even Factions when it was around), which has lead to its own can of worms and player dissatisfaction. The other issue is it changed the dynamic of what it meant to get a package. In D1, reputation packages were rewards for continued participating in the activity related to the vendor. In D2, you're doing a job, getting paid, and buying from the store you basically work for to get the money. In regards to what is happening, it's exactly the same, but there is a different feeling between the two, and the limitations of the reputation system meant players had to play the activity every season to get the new things. As for why people liked using resources to upgrade rep for vendors, it's because it was an *additive* experience on top of earning reputation, not the core system. If in D1, the only way to get vendor packages is to get planetary resources, that'd feel pretty shit

---
#**The (Possible) Solution**    
My proposed solution for this is to return to the reputation system and either allow us to grab packages from anywhere (open the tower map, click the vendor, receive the package) or deliver the package to us like an engram (though this method may disconnect players from that feeling of prize similar to what daily challenges did when replacing bounties). *However*, keep tokens around and use it as a means to buy bounties that *reward specific gear.* There will be daily and weekly bounties like normal, but on top of that, there will be ""gear bounties"", one for each slot on your character. If you want the new strike gauntlet, use your tokens earned to buy multiple gauntlet bounties to work on during strikes. Like that new kinetic shotgun? Use tokens to get the kinetic weapon bounties. Turn it into an additive system that gives players control of their loot earned, but still requires them to *play* the activity. For Trials and IB's limited pool of weapons, maybe have it so each time the event rolls around, only specific weapon bounties will be available to earn that specific week. Even if they hoard tokens, they'd still need to participate in the activity to complete the bounties at all rather than amassing tokens over time, then dumping it all whenever they want. Keep in mind, these loot bounties are *additive.* Players must still be able to earn gear from reputation with vendors *and* through gameplay rewards. Specifically for Trials, there must be incentive to go flawless, similar to raids, such as a means to guarantee high stat armor/different armor aesthetic or weapons with perks exclusive to flawless weapons (adept weapons... I'm talking about adept weapons)

Just my two cents on what I feel is one of Destiny's biggest faults with a system originally meant to be a quality of life change for players. I'm open to discussion whether you disagree that tokens are bad, or have other ideas for a system you feel is more engaging to players that would alleviate the ""hoarding"" problem with tokens",4,1585620978,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs4gyb/the_token_system_is_a_problem/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs4frt,kuromahou,This game needs a Season of Mending,"First, I love this game, I'm enjoying this season, and I'm getting stomped on in Trials but still loving it.

But. This game needs some TLC. Everything from Quality of Life issues, to disconnects, and bugs, and the rampant, rampant cheating/hacking on PC, Destiny has never felt this abandoned by the QA team. 

1.) The disconnection issues feel like they're at launch levels. Ruined cards, ruined competitive, ruined nightfalls; it's really, really bad this season. Maybe it's the internet itself, but there has to be something Bungie can do to add some resiliency to their netcode to make it either harder to lose connection, or easier to reconnect.

2.) At least on PC, the cheating and hacking is absolutely rampant. I haven't seen a game in this bad of shape in years, and I'm shocked that Bungie, of all companies, has let this happen. Anyone who watched major streamers this weekend on Trials cards saw it first hand. Major, 800+ viewer streamers had games against these people. The clips are all over twitter. The cat is out of the bag, and Bungie seems powerless to prevent them, and only able to get them after the fact. But by then, it's too late. Can you imagine the absolute fury, dejection, and helplessness someone who finally got to 6 wins on a card must feel when their 7th match is against one of these hackers? This, this above all else will relegate Destiny to the dust bin. If hackers are allowed to proliferate, the gmae is as good as dead. The trust will be gone. Nothing will ever be viewed as legitimate, regardless. You cannot afford to lose the community's trust on cheating.

3.) Speaking of Trials, the gameplay loop/reward structure needs reworking, across the board. Trials highlights it, but the game as a whole needs a refocus away from bounties, and back towards core gameplay. The champions requiring CGC weapons and mods is *really* tiresome at this point. Exotics have been, for the most part, cast aside in things like Nightfalls and LLSes because you nee a legendary SMG/Sidearm/HC/AR for the Barrier/Unstoppable/Overload Champs.

Bungie: Forget whatever new Menagie clone you've got. Save it for the season after. Just sit on it. Spend whatever resources are left making Destiny (which, honestly, doesn't feel like a lot, thanks [redacted]), and put it all towards fixing bugs, improving the UX, and adding cheating PREVENTION, not just detection to this game. The game just feels right now like it's falling apart.

The list of things to fix is long, but it's all, for the most part, minor things. Before it's too late, Bungie, stop what you're doing, and just focus on repair. Focus on what you already have, and making it AAA quality again. You've lost that. Since moving to steam, the game is starting to feel shoddy. Your reputation here is on the line.

Currently there's a bundle for two expansions on sale on the PlayStation Store, but I'm a physical copy kind of guy.

Let's assume you're playing for Free. You're locked out of 3 subclasses, the majority of raids, a good chunk of exotics. This sucks, but you're a reasonable consumer. You like the game, so you spend 60 bucks (turning it into a full-priced retail game) and get the Forsaken and Shadowkeep content.

Congrats, you now have access to all the actual gameplay, and premium Season Pass rewards!

Except now, you have to dedicate a lot of time to grinding out bounties and playing the game more-so than any other to fully reap the benefits, because if you don't, those extra rewards are unobtainable after a few months, not to mention the seasonal activity is dissappearing (assuming you're not already used to the revamped Menagerie activity). And let's not forget that if you're buying Shadowkeep in Season of the Worthy, you've already missed out on 1/3 of the Premium Season Pass! Better hope you can get to Season Rank 100 without burning out or feeling like your time's been wasted!

Oh what's that? You **did** shell out 60 bucks, and got to Season Rank 100, but you're not feeling quite unique amongst all the other blueberries, in spite of all the time and money you've sunk? Well let me tell you, I've got the perfect solution!

Spend *more* money in the Eververse to get those really unique looking ornaments, ships, emotes, and Ghost shells! Need a new look, Guardian? We've got one, if you're willing to ignore the fact that we're asking you to buy our in-game currency that when used will always leave a little bit over (thus causing you to think 'if I spend X more I'll have enough for Y')!

fs3zoh,Zin-Pop,It’s Time To Stop Playing And Show Bungie That This Is Unacceptable.,"(Sorry if formatting is bad, this is my first post and I’m mobile)

I’ve absolutely had it with Season of Worthless. 

At first, I didn’t mind too much about the endless bounty farming. But, once I realized that there were other bunkers I stopped bounty farming. 

TL;DR: I got tired of bounties but I didn’t care that much because trials.

I thought next that the focus and resources were put into Trials. I was super happy until I played pvp and experienced the meta. It feels like no one at Bungie plays pvp at times. The auto rifle changes just proves that Bungie changes things for the sake of changing thinking that they’ve done a favour for us. 

Trials wouldn’t feel this bad if they didn’t over hyping it for keeping trials in development for way too long. Like seriously Bungie how long did it take to make a couple legendary weapons and armour that already existed in D1. It feels like a bunch of developers that were actually passionate about this game could’ve made this mode in a couple of weeks at max. 

TL;DR: Trials feels like a game jam made by 5 people for fun. 

Alright now on to my “IdEa” that will die in new:

We should honestly stop playing the game until it’s fixed and feels like a real AAA game. 

Right now active players are probably higher due to COVID-19 (hope everyone is staying safe and healthy). I think it would really show Bungie if we stopped playing for now. The game will still be here for you when it’s back. Or when you want to pick up that seasonal exotic you want. 

It’s not like there is nothing to play. RE3 is coming out on the 3rd, FF7 on the 10th and Nioh  2 is out right now with many more good games on the way. 

My plan is to pick up the exotics and see what guardians games and gm nightfall (on the off chance this takes off I will only grab the exotics to be a “fearless leader”. I won’t be grabbing any of the legendary warmind weapons because the perks and there will be way better seasonal weapons) 

Until then I recently finished the Last of Us, I will be beating it on the hardest mode now in prep for Part 2 and racing my friend in the dlc which I haven’t played yet. Also I want to get back into Overwatch (dm if you want to play comp on ps4 :)

fs3rq7,MarxGT,Bungie needs start playtesting exotics before they buff or nerf a class of weapons,"Bungie's apparent philosophy of buffing or nerfing an entire class of weapons without fully testing all of the weapons involved has been their track record. There is absolutely nothing wrong with buffing or nerfing a weapon class or archetype if they are under performing because the difference between any weapon of a given archetype is minimal at best. There is no dominant 450 rpm auto rifle that is ultimately better than any other 450 for any reason other than perks. However, exotics need to be tested separate from any other weapons. The reason hardlight is dominating crucible right now isn't because auto rifles are overpowered, it is because a weapon with insane stability, no damage falloff and increased damage on ricochets got buffed. It is the same problem with the nerfing of snipers. Just because izanagi's burden is over performing in PvE doesn't mean snipers in general need nerfs. For the love of God, test exotics before you roll out a buff and test legendaries before you roll out a nerf.",4,1585618270,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs3rq7/bungie_needs_start_playtesting_exotics_before/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs3p4n,JukeBoxHero1997,Last Word catalyst concept,"The idea behind catalysts is to masterwork exotics, right? Make them stronger than they are, and doing so requires finding and working towards upgrading them. Essentially, bringing them to their full potential while also gaining better mastery of said weapon.

With this concept in mind, I think an interesting way to either get the catalyst to drop or complete its objective would be to replicate the weapon's most famous feat in slaying the darkest shadow ever known to Guardians: Dredgen Yor.

But he's already dead, you may say, so how would this be done? We wouldn't be killing Yor again (though I have some interesting thoughts for another potential post later).  Rather, we'd be facing a facsimile in the form of the Nightmare of Dredgen Yor.  

If you're skeptical about whether it would work lore wise, Nightmares are described on destinypedia as ""phantom-like apparitions of trauma created from the Darkness by the Pyramids, often manifesting as past figures and enemies to exploit the worst fears of Guardians and other beings."" You can't legitimately say Dredgen Yor doesn't fit the bill, given all that he's done. 

He could be found somewhere on the moon or earth at random, or after completing a random number of patrols (like the ones that would sometimes give strange coins in D1), or it could even be a unique mission (though I'd like it to be repeatable, since it's such a cool concept).  While any weapon could hurt him, the Last Word would be the most effective weapon.  Upon killing the nightmare, it either drops the catalyst (after the 1st time killing it) or completes the masterwork objective, whichever this concept is assigned to. 

Now you may be thinking, ""But it's a gun for PvP, so the catalyst should drop from PvP and be completed in PvP."" I can respect that, and I could also argue that some weapons that are better in PvE get their catalysts from PvP instead of or in addition to PvE (mainly strikes) and everything, but I'll just cut to the chase: that's BORING.  Seriously, why not have a little fun with it? The Last Word, along with Thorn, has such an interesting, deep backstory to it (just ask MyNameisByf), so why not make upgrading it equally as interesting, or at least give it some depth? 

And hey, something similar can be done with Thorn's catalyst, except maybe make the nightmare one of Jaren Ward or even Shin Malphur (it's a dead Dredgen's Thorn, and they probably feared and had nightmares about Shin, so he'd probably make more sense).

This is just an idea I had while watching Byf's video. Let me know what you guys think!",4,1585617993,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs3p4n/last_word_catalyst_concept/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs3g94,china27,Time for everyone to understand what destiny is now.,"Enough of the posts about changes and reverting back to what once was. No more eververse discussion. No more content discussion. No more talk about raid weapons being unique or any gear for that matter having any rarity. No more hero moments. That's not what Destiny is anymore and likely won't ever be what it once was back in the the end of destiny 1.

Eververse. Everyone gets all of the exotics. No more special moments or great because everyone is doing the same thing getting the same gear. That's this game.

Eververse is here to stay, seasonal content formulas are here stay.

It's time to embrace what it is or move on. Bungie had (yes, had. It happened a long time ago!) made the business decision to move the franchise in a certain direction and will not change what they are doing. 

I truly believe that the ""we're listening to your feedback"" is a canned answer and has no real support. (No knock on Cozmo or DMG, they do a helluva job in the most impossible position in a very tough environment).  

I truly believe that, occasionally, if a certain complaint gets addressed it's likely out of sheer luck that it's on their agenda anyway or it's such an overwhelming issue that it must be addressed. Fixes are not happening because any listening is actually happening. It's because it happens to be a coincidence that it's part of a predetermined development.

I think if everyone who wants to remain with the franchise needs to embrace what the game has evolved to or to move on to other things. Its not sad or anything to be upset over. It's just what destiny is, plain and simple. 

Embrace it if you love it, break up if you don't. But don't stay for the wrong reasons.

fs33cr,Nimiol,"Yesterday I had fun while just ignoring bounties, XP and all sorts of grinds.","I just stuck in the Strike playlist and tried to make use of a punch build. It was fun and reminded me Destiny still has its awesome basics. Nice guns and abilities, dynamic movement, different alien enemies which feel great to thrash, satisfying cooperative gameplay and a constant loot flow. Sometimes less is more.

I think that a lot of the frustration we have now can easily be dispelled if next season they eliminate some hurdles and just let us play.

Example, what if we upgraded bunkers and got their perks/mods by simply doing the new activities and earning outright ‘unlocks’ instead of jumping through hoops for currencies (of which the game has WAY too many). In Trials, what if it were easier to turn tokens in (and also more motivating to go flawless with adept weapons)?

Put loot at the end, let us be creative and powerful in between, and we will play. Bungie seems to overthink things too much.

Get x kills with solar, void, or arc subclass equipped.

Weapon bounties can be more specific. Get 50 headshots or 10 kill in crucible with a handcannon to get season handcannon. Add stages to that bounty even. 

Bounties seem like a chore, of course, but it would also allow me to clean my inventory up if I didn’t have to have one of every weapon type at all times, unless I was specifically pursuing a bounty for, and they can be a lot more passive allowing anyone to achieve them in any play session.",7,1585615643,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs3305/can_bounties_be_simplified/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs2prf,PeterPiper21,How does devoured light in the crucible work?,"For those who didn't know, after a while in a trials match, if there is no winning side then a point needs to be captured. However, the interesting part is that if you aren't on the point, a debuff appears on everyone who isn't on the point called devoured light. Devoured light will slowly kill you, but as you start to die your death isn't normal. Instead of slowly losing health, darkness overpowers your screen until you die. How does this connect to the lore in any way? I do know that Brother Vance did some testing in trials with guardians that was considered unethical, but there was nothing mentioned about devoured light. Could this connect to the sounds that Vance was hearing when a guardian died?

fs2oeh,BizzyB0I,Gun Balance,"I played a rumble match thinking it would be easy as it usually is, I haven’t played since last season and didn’t think it would be that bad.
Why tf is everyone using the Suros, Hardlight ,and literally any shotgun that isn’t slug.
It’s because Bungie seems to like to rotate the meta as well as champion mods. But for some reason they want shotguns in the meta at all times.
I understand that guns need balance, but to make the other options almost unusable is ridiculous. 
I also want to point out that Tommy’s Matchbook is a great idea with a pretty bad delivery. It’s viable in PVE but it’s almost unusable in pvp, compared to suros and hardlight, tommys is barely an exotic.
I love this game and I was excited for this season, but aside from pve just being bounties this game seriously needs some balancing. 
I am amazed that after 3 years and an entire new game Bungie still hasn’t figure out special ammo, the amount of people abusing the “revive with two shots” of special ammo is ridiculous. It’s just titans running around shotgunning till they die, then they start again.",2,1585614190,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs2oeh/gun_balance/,DestinyTheGame,1

fs2nmw,Maul61,So... The Last Word,"It sucks.

The Last Word is on my all time favorite guns list. It's an awesome weapon with amazing concept and amazing executions. The problem is, it just isn't good anymore. 

Before season of the worthy, it was overpowered and  I was fine with them nerfing it and it was perfect. However, I guess they thought it was still too good and so they nerfed it again, and now it's trash. 

I don't get why they can nerf such a good gun into the ground yet buff a weapon that was once trash so absurdly to the point where it has become the new meta and everyone uses it. I'm talking to you Hard Light. 

There are so many guns that are better and more fun than the Hard Light (the Chaperone being one 0f my personal faves) yet it's all that people use. 

Destiny is currently in a place so horrendous that I would rather quit entirely than put up with this. The current meta is horrible and so many weapons that are too overpowered and so many weapons that were once good and that take skill to use are now trash.

Bottom line is. Bungee needs the buff the Last Word back to the way it was after its first nerf, nerf the Hard Light and Suros Regime, and maybe give the Last Word of catalyst while you're at it.

fs2il8,BU2B2112,Making Iron Banana clash instead of control would make the entire process infinitely more enjoyable.,"Under the circumstances I have played quite a lot of Iron Banner this time around and I have noticed that people just tend to avoid the flags. The reason for this remains a mystery to science, maybe they don't like to win? The amount of times I have solo capped a flag to prevent a full lockout while my ""team mates"" roam the map and feed the enemy team points has become too high to keep track of. There is an easy solution to this problem, just remove the flags. Then the apes can roam the map and like minded guardians that like to play the objective can play without the urge to throw up in their mouths at the thought of crucible.

Eververse should sell cosmetic items that completely contrast from in game loot, something that makes you really stand out and has no relation to the seasonal content whatsoever. It should still fit the style of destiny, but not the style of the dlc content.

The only thing that will make Bungie actually respond is to quit playing the game and have their numbers drop. 

**And guess what? Now is a great time to do that.** Almost nothing in the game is essential(in the terms of the game) to get. There is no Gally, no recluse, no mythoclast. Trials is a mess (and if you’re like me, full of gear you already earned in D1).

But people always seem to complain about Eververse? Why? cosmetic stuff only that doesn't affect gameplay. Now, you might say you spent money on the season.. well yes, but you also get 100+ levels worth of stuff? 

Honestly just wondering why people care so much. If you want it you can buy it with Silver/bright dust or wait a few seasons and get it on the returning engrams.

My buddies have been playing a lot with trials back, so I jumped in and got my Hunter up to 960 as of yesterday. I’ve been diggin it (contrary to what the sub feels like.

I'm just curious why the moon, as a part of an expansion that cost $30 at launch, has the shittiest loot while the literal newbie planet drops the best stuff (in my experience). Again, maybe it's not like this for everyone, but that's been my experience.

fs1inw,lIx_Stryker_xIl,PvP pinnacle weapon issue,"You see this title and think I’m gonna start saying how broken pinnacles (not ritual) are and how they should be nerfed back to a green. 
Well Anon, it’s quite the opposite.

Ever since the first pvp pinnacles were released, I’ve seen nothing but hate put towards them. And I think there’s a reason behind it.

  
If you look at the history of changelogs, all pvp pinnacles have been altered or changed in some way.
Let me break this down for ya


Lunas Howl / Not Forgotten : 
• RPM changed from 180 to 150
• Magnificent Howl no longer increases the damage, of third headshot. Instead it increases the range of that shot


Mountaintop :
• Quest reduces in difficulty, thus making it easier to acquire by casual players


Redrix’s Breadsword/Claymore :
• Damage per bullet decreases when Desperado is active


Recluse :
• Master of Arms no longer affects the precision damage modifier 
(Pretty much unchanged on pc, but feels neutered on console)


Notice how I left one weapon out? Yep, Revoker. Because nothing is wrong with Revoker. 
Now that Trials of Osiris is back, I’ve seen steep influx of people complaining about Revoker. 

People have been saying its over powered, people are saying its being abused, and people are now calling for a nerf... I’m not sure about you, but I see a pattern here. 



In [MY] personal opinion, pinnacle weapons should be better than others due to how you obtain them. And oh my TRAVELER you people, look at the definition of “pinnacle”!!

Best of the best, cream of the crop, top of its class!! They’re made powerful for a reason!


Obviously, some are easier to get than others (Recluse vs Mountiantop) however, they’re still challenging to get in comparison to just running some strikes to get a weapon you want. 


All opinions of mine aside, we need to take into account the influence of content creators. The most prominent one being CammyCakes. Who is best known for giving tips and tricks on how to play pvp in the best ways possible. 
Now however, he is on twitter typing away that Revoker is being overused and it needs a nerf. Why now? Why not when it came out all the way back in Season of Opulence? (September 2019 btw)


Up until now, I’ve never seen one complaint about the weapon, hell, I’ve HERD all of these content creators praise it! Cerridius for example, it is and I quote “His favourite sniper in Destiny 2”


I understand this post is mostly a rant about how toxic the pvp community can be the second someone has an advantage over them, but I really wanted to bring attention to it.

It’s unfair to the people who have worked for the pinnacles just to have it nerfed by a group of people who can’t use it.

fs1axf,mwelsh2035,"Trials is getting a lot of negativity, especially from casuals. All of the feedback that I have seen is valid and warranted. I feel like Trials is getting a huge microscope right now though because of the enormous lack of content and rewards this Season.","The last time we had a Season that was focused around 1 mode was Drifter. Even so, Drifter brought the following:

Gambit Prime - Plus 2 new maps. 

3-Tier Reckoning Activity

4 Sets of Themed Armor per class

10 Weapons - All of which were pretty badass, with highly lethal perk combos.

3 PINNACLE weapons - Recluse, 21% Delirium and Oxygen

Gifts of Nine - Light Story Missions

Zero Hour Outbreak Mission

I might even be missing a few things. In any case, when you compare to this season, here is where we are at currently (fully admit we are simply 'in progress' on this season):

Single, 1 tier public activity on different locations. 

6 NEW Weapons - 2 in the Battle Pass - Not all available yet. 

Faction Rally Weapons and Gear - Random Drops

Legendary Lost Sectors and Bunkers

Trials - 6 reprised Weapons - 1 set of reprised Armor per Class

It has been my observation that players are generally down about all of the new weapons, except the Shotty, because the weapons are either under performing archtypes or the perk pools are just weak. The Trials weapons, while reprised, all seem to be pretty good. 

Players are generally frustrated with the World Loot Pool because it is very hard to farm/get what you are after and the perk pools of the Faction weapons are also notoriously weak. 

All of the PvE activities have been meh at best. 

All of this is to say, Trials is THE THING to do right now. That is problematic all on its own. This is a pinnacle PvP activity. For some us, Flawless just isn't something we will ever get (although I won't stop trying). I'm 100% OK with that. I want the hardcore PvP folks to get some love too.

fs0m4v,swooshieblooshie,Either exclusively make Seasons or have the drought between massive expansions.,"I feel like Bungie producing the seasons and the big September expansion both at once is just not good for development. Although the droughts between the big expansions in D1 were a little too long, I feel like at least I still stuck with the game in those droughts knowing that Bungie would drop the bomb ass expansion. Here, in Destiny 2 I feel disappointed. I feel like it's better to have hope and excitement rather that hopelessness and disappointment. In the state the game is in right now, seasons are not bringing enough to the table. They don't have much content and in season of the Dawn and Worthy, one of the big gameplay mechanics was farming bounties and lost sectors to get upgrades that will just disappear for the next season for the next bunker/obelisk mechanic to start again. It felt amazing playing the new expansions like TTK, Rise of Iron and Forsaken on launch. It was bundle loads of hype for those expansions, and since Bungie had their sweet time to produce it, those expansions came out amazing. Shadowkeep was a good expansion, but since Bungie was working on the seasons before it and also the whole FTP and cross save stuff kept them busy. And now, with Activision gone as well, Bungie doesn't have even enough resources to keep up with last year and some felt that last year was a little slow as well. I feel like Bungie will come out with some badass reveal trailer for the September expansion and reveal that they're fixing all the bounty simulator issues and maybe this time the community might be split into spending their money on this. This happens literally every time. We can't keep let this happening, it's just a really unhealthy habit. It still amazes me how Bungie can innovate so much and produce God-like content like forsaken or the ttk, but these two expansions were made to save destinys playerbase and lifespan. Bungie put every thing into these 2 expansions because if they failed, everyone would lose complete faith in destiny as a franchise.",1,1585606760,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs0m4v/either_exclusively_make_seasons_or_have_the/,DestinyTheGame,1
fs0lg9,TheseNewtsOnYourChin,The Ordeal Strikes and how I would make them a core end-game activity you’d want to play.,"I’ve recently been trying to think of ways that Destiny 2s core activities can become the main part of the game again. Go away from the wide as an ocean, shallow as a puddle style we have at the moment. 

Also I’m in lockdown due to COVID-19 in my country so I have time to think about it. 

Nightfall Strikes

I think we can all agree Strikes can get stale pretty quickly. Now it’s important to have normal strikes for players as they go through the campaigns and that sort of thing. However, I have an idea on how to create a more end game version that improves on The Ordeal version of Strikes. 

Each Strike is now made up of 3 parts. Beginning, middle, end. 

Each of these sections are made up of a different part of a different strike. So for example, you may have the Beginning section of The Arms Dealer, middle section of The Pyramidion, and end section of The Scarlet Keep. Each of the sections would have their respective enemies, and on harder difficulties, different modifiers for each section. I’m no developer but I’m thinking something like a loading part similar to the infinite forest would be possible? The parts where to go between sections you have that triangle tunnel. 

Now this could rotate daily, bi-weekly, weekly, or be every single time you play it. Not sure, might be better weekly so that people can get used to which weapons they want to use and strategy for each section. 

This would make Nightfall Strikes more interesting and something teams can actually plan and strategise for while still being difficult and provide endgame rewards.

fs081s,T_Gamer-mp4,A thought to fix up trials - Flawless Radiance(s) and the ideas of the past.,"Trials doesn't feel so good. And I mean that in the least offensive way possible. I want it to feel good. I want it to be a smooth, competitive scene where everything goes well. But it hasn't so far, and I'm sure the devs have heard enough of the yelling. Here's my feedback and proposed solution to the issues.

**Part one: Define the problems**

* Feels unrewarding at lower levels due to RNG drops and token-based farming.
* Feels unrewarding at higher levels due to limited flawless rewards.

Quite simply, trials biggest issue is that it doesn't feel rewarding in the right way. Pro players only have incentive to farm lower level ones instead of going for flawless because of how the token system works. Low-skill players have no incentive to play because they're going to get farmed, or even if they do get to 3 wins, they might not even get a gun they want. By clearing this up, trials can feel good for all players, rather than just the pros.

**Part two: Solutions**

One of the key ideas in all solutions the playerbase makes should be that it's easy to implement. The solutions I have here shouldn't be too difficult to do so, as far as I know. Another general concept is that we should learn from prior success that has been made. I took most of my inspiration from the Black Armory, because it shares one of Trials's principles: a heavy focus on weapons.

*Concept A: Flawless/Adept ""Radiance"" and the idea of adept weapons*

The community has been screeching for adept weapons since trials came out. My issue with this is that it would take the sprite &amp; art team a lot more time to do, and they're already quite overbooked. My proposition to fix this is to take a page out of the Black Armory Book: Radiance. Create a second slot on all trials gear, that's reserved for a new kind of Radiance that drops from the lighthouse chest. You could make this give the flawless glow, and color would be modified by the equipped emblem. I wouldn't make this glow ""fade"" like current glows do, but I digress. 

Equipping this would give the weapon an extra perk. Ideally, swap ~~celery~~  ~~salary~~ ~~celebrity~~ CELERITY with a different perk on each weapon, and make it be the ""radiant perk"" for all weapons. If that's not the case, get funky with it. Autorifle with firing line. Sniper with overflow. Scout rifle with Clown Cartridge. Something completely unique - or if it's easier, just celerity.

You could also DISMANTLE the radiance, and get five (5) enhancement prisms and twenty (20) tokens. This way the players that already have all the radiances they want, or don't have a weapon they want to put it on, still can get some aspect of reward from it.

Now, that would solve the issues of flawless loot. The next issue is solving low-level loot:

*Concept B: Trials weapon frames and the idea of ""Play your way"".*

The idea is quite simple; rather than having four items selected to be weekly drops at 3/5/7/F wins, instead create four weapon/armor frames that Saint-14 sells for 30 Tokens. To complete a frame, you have to play trials - wins count as 3 points, losses count as 2, and you need 10 points total. Once you complete that, you talk to Saint, and he gives you your weapon. (IF that seems too easy, you could make the weapon rewarded on your next win. )

This not only gives players a choice of what weapons they get, but also a path for lower-skill players to be able to obtain loot. On top of that, it removes one of the causes of ""low-card-token-grinding"" (LCTG), being that you dilute your loot pool by going flawless. Now, players can get the loot they want, when they want. Combined with concept A, the flawless player will still have some reason to go flawless AND low level players will still have reason to play - except, we need to now 100% counter LCTG. Which takes us to...

*Concept C: Rework Passage of Wealth to reward more on high-card wins.*

Simple enough idea, match the Wealth passage to the Wisdom passage, and make it reward more tokens upon each win. The following numbers are stand-ins, but could work;

* Win 1 = 3 Tokens
* Win 2 = 4 Tokens
* 3 = 6
* 4 = 9 
* 5 = 13
* 6 = 18
* 7 = 24

total: 77 tokens. Current in-game total of tokens is 21 without wealth, 35 with. These extra tokens will cause players who would normally LCTG to instead try and get more rewards.

Also, I'd buff the Passage of Ferocity to reward 55 tokens instead of one extra item, and to give extra token drops (see above) on extra wins on a flawless card. Additionally, make any 7 win card give an extra 15 tokens upon reset, so that there's incentive for people to go through with that process.

**tl;dr:**

* make radiance slot on trials weapons, equipping a special radiance that drops from flawless gives adpet perk
* give saint weapon frames that cost tokens to acquire
* make the passage of wealth more rewarding, along with ferocity

While I do think that these changes would work to alleviate some of the issues with trials, I would love to hear more feedback. thank you for the read!",1,1585605511,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fs081s/a_thought_to_fix_up_trials_flawless_radiances_and/,DestinyTheGame,1

I don't think ill get flawless ever with my team and we try for 3 wins and 5 wins, with getting bounties we were able to farm somewhat of good weapons and gears.

Trials is the pvp endgame but I wanted the people to know there are casual players like me approaching trials like an event mode just enjoying the adrenaline rush in clutch moments.

Just wanted to share my approach on trials to the community!

shout out to all the steamers and sweats helping people get flawless and showing some good clips to enjoy! GL to all people in trials and in their future runs.",0,1585602320,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frz8sc/me_a_casual_player_at_this_state_of_trials/,DestinyTheGame,1
frz6cm,Bellatrix087,Bring back prototype weapons...with a twist,"So back in TTK (I think) we got prototype weapons we could use to gain gunsmith reputation. But back then, they were just low quality guns, the challenge being they are difficult to use since they are prototypes. I want to bring that back, but with a new spin that will make up for ritual weapons.

My pitch is the same low quality weapon, but the perks are what is being tested. I want some radical perks. Some helpful, some harmful, and some just plain ridiculous. 

Like a shotgun that gets a significant range increase when you get a kill (helpful perk) but if you reload you'll get a severe range decrease (harmful). Or a sniper that deals equal damage to you and the person you shot (ridiculous). You can come up with anything. A fusion rifle that can only reload after you run for a bit. A side arm that unloads its entire clip in a second but not all shots will deal damage. Just some fun and goofy stuff to make destiny fun to play. 

And the best part, they wont affect the meta or be broken because, like the prototypes back in TTK, they can no longer be used once completed. So you get this op shotgun or god awful handcannon for like 20 kills and then it turns into a bounty you can redeem. No fuss. No meta changes. Just a fun little side thing that can put some spice in the game. And give us some fun perks we don't really see anymore.",8,1585602092,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frz6cm/bring_back_prototype_weaponswith_a_twist/,DestinyTheGame,1

fryspz,liebs085,Nothing Gold Can Stay,"  

The guardian gazed out over the valley from a top the crest on the Peak, his eyes drifting from crumbling buildings to patch work towers. The soft glow of falling embers glittering in the morning light as the Last Cities’ inhabitants once again continued to build their monuments to a life all but forgotten.

\*zrrt..kracckk\* ""The reconstruction efforts are coming along nicely, don't you think?"" buzzed the Guardians Ghost.

The Guardian looked at the city down below. A Garden of Plasteel and concrete, ever growing and reaching towards greatness. His thoughts drifted. How long have they been toiling away at these structures..these castles of..steel..of sand? Months? Years? Do they ever seem to make any progress? The workers..scurrying around like ants, frantically trying to build their own piece of happiness, only to have the next tide flow in and wash away their pride. How many times now? rebuild..recycle..renew..repeat...How many times can they continue this cycle? 

The Guardian was one of the first of the new age of risen. Known to many as an Alpha age. He was life, breathed into a sleeping husk amid the rusted skeletons in Russia, wrapped in awe and splendor of this new world. Some would say that was a dark age..but no, to the guardian, that was His Age. An age of Discovery, of Light and Darkness, an Age of Kings and Wolves and new worlds to experience. Many times did he stumble as he grew. Many times did he face almost certain defeat amidst the smothering of light. Rose tinted glasses can only color the past so well. But always still a spark remained. Small, miniscule, but resolute against the tides of flowing Darkness.

\*Zrt zrtt\* ""I know that look...you are thinking about... them..aren't you?""

Yes, thought the Guardian, Yes, now that was an Age...He thought back to his old fireteam. Warriors of pure light and malice, graceful and resolute. Long did they fight back against the Darkness. Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. It was together they bathed the Glass Vaults of Time in milky radiolarian. It was together they avenged the thousands of guardians in the hallowed graves of Luna. It was together they sliced through the veil of worlds to topple a king. It was together they lamented for not purchasing an old rocket launcher none of them could properly pronounce that the cities scrappers uncovered. It was together they silenced the howling of Wolves and became Lords unto themselves...yes..it was always together.

The wind kicked up a pile of leaves, twirling and blowing across the Guardian's visor towards the Last City. Sounds of construction drifted through the breeze as the city awoke to another day. Another day of life, of work, of rebuilding their castles of sand. 

Again, the Guardians thoughts drifted. It was in the attack by the Red Legion that they tasted true defeat. It was supposed to be an time of splendor, a time of new beginnings.. Yet, in only a few weeks time, legions of Guardians were snuffed out. A once blinding army of light, engulfed by darkness, never to rise again. The remaining few marched on. Hope held close in belief that they could once again return to glory. But now, only he remained, only he recalled the memories of his fireteam as they drifted away on the breeze like fleeting whisps of smoke, growing fainter with each passing day. And in return, the Guardian felt more and more alien in the world he once swore to protect, in a world he called home.

The Guardian's gaze drifted to the new Tower. The rebuilt beacon of ""hope"" to the next age of guardians. Young and eager to defend the faceless population of ants, scurrying beneath their wings of light. Even this place, so familiar, grew to be more and more alien. What once was filled with the thrums of sparrows, mystery, and excitement, now replaced with memories of ghosts long since silent, bowls of ramen left chilled and forgotten. Great golden spires now replaced with the dull and soulless sheen of Silver. Faces once full of life, now hollow, perpetuating a daily cycle of menial shores. An illusion of a life that once was... 

The Guardian unhitched the power cell to his old Omolon Scout Rifle and stuck the butt end into the ground. He had heard someone called this model a... jury or something. He never knew the name. He just remembered the Godlike power he felt when he Rolled through the fallen on the battlefields or the titles he earned in the crucible, inflicting fiery explosion after fiery explosion. Every hitch in the barrel another victory.. now too just a Memory known only to him, and as with all other memories..it too was fading with time. 

Long ago the Guardian heard of a great warrior. One whose light was so strong they stemmed the tide of darkness. Facing battle after battle. In the end, having his fill of  war and turmoil to last generations, the warrior set himself to sleep, deep in the Cosmodrome. Maybe it was time for him to sleep. Maybe this guardian's war against the darkness was at its end. Maybe he would let the people build their castles of sand and let the tide wash them away as it had so many times before. Let them rebuild..let them recycle..let them....renew. 

The Guardian walked into the bunker that was long ago dug into the hillside. He carefully walked down the rusted steps and into the chamber with the sole functioning cryopod, his Ghost lighting the way. His shadow danced along the walls, emanating his story. Playing out his every great victory in succession. Maybe, he thought, maybe this will be a new age for some other guardian. But to him, his age..his Golden age had passed. Let another bear the torch and maybe one day, they will build castles of brick and mortar that will finally endure. 

The Guardian activated the cryopod stasis sequence and the cover slowly closed around him. No words needed to be spoken to his ghost, for they had undergone more than any could imagine. Shared more than most could ever dream. No words need be spoken between those whose bond was built by Light and Blood. 

The Ghost silently watched the Guardian enter his sleep. Ice crystals instantly forming on the inner glass like spiderwebs of crystal. The Ghost's light dimmed softly, his own way of saying goodbye to his guardian...his companion..his friend. So much had they seen, yet he knew it was time for his Guardian to sleep. With that the Ghost floated down and gently rested atop the cryopod, initiating his own sleep program. His final thoughts drifting to his Guardian.

frylf0,McDons45,"What I would do to make trials healthy and sustainable, from a top 1% PvP player with 8k hours logged in the destiny universe.","I truly hope someone sees this, because I am sad. 

I dont want to reiterate points and beat a dead horse, here is how I would make trials worthwhile to the top players, mid tier, and bottom tier PvPers. 

1. Change the token system, rather than farmable rolls, Saint-14 sells 1 piece of armor, and 1 weapon per week, Each costs 50 tokens, Bounties are completable daily, and if you complete all bounties over the course of the weekend, you are rewarded with 70 tokens. Play some games to get 30 more, and you can get both drops. 0 wins required.
2. Matchmaking is card based, 0-6 wins, then 7+ wins. No mismatching. 
3. Change entirely the way the cards work. Once a player succeeds on a flawless trials ticket, they LOSE the ability to reset that ticket, they are considered flawless for the entire week. (hear me out here streamers and carriers)
   1. If you have a flawless ticket that week, a few new things open up. A solo playlist, exclusive to flawless players, to continue to play trials in sweaty games. Every game post flawless, whether in solo or teams has a chance at receiving ANY reward. endlessly and infinite for that week, shaders, ships, titles, yes titles, banners and cosmetics added to the loot pool. ALSO ADD BRIGHT DUST TO THE LOOT POOL, amounts of 10-50 per drop for the highest skill players. 
   2. The reward system has to be fundamentally changed,  again no random loot from saint 2 pieces rotated weekly, 3, 5, 7 win cards reward a random drop, like d1. Only avail once per weekend. 
4. Aggressive matchmaking to make sure, flawless players only que against flawless players, and are adequately rewarded for continuing to play. 

Why does this all work, and need to be done? 

&amp;#x200B;

This gives a reason for lower tier players to play, they have a decent challenge token wise to farm, so if they are hopeless at getting even 3 wins, they can achieve rewards but they are forced to play. 

The mid tier players, are incentivized to try towards the end of the weekend, there may be some late to the party sweats, but most of the best of the best will be out of the matchmaking system for wins 0-6, allowing these mid tier players a chance at coveted success. 

Everyone is rewarded. Low end players, who undoubtedly will not play in the sweaty 7+ game playlists will get weekly rewards, the gamers/streamers/cracked out kids will be fully suited up and look like the badasses they are 

It solves the problems of hopelessness, lack of loot, and lack of reason to play for the entire community, Monday night will be a crapshoot of gamers, who just might be able to luck their way into flawless, do they deserve it? Absolutely, they won 7 games, and as a community we want everyone to have fun right? They don't need to be as good as us, they just need to complete what we did. 

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe this is what the game needs, the sweats need to be put into a sweaty playlist, if we are that good, we'll find success against others of our kind. 

Lower tier players will see their chance, and take it, reviving the playlist for all who play. 

Some bad people will wait until Monday night to get an easy run, and so be it, they will finish their run, collect loot, and have no time to farm more, as they waited till the last minute. The incentive is there for them to get into those sweat playlists (hopefully)

Sincerely, 

A Destiny fanboy who really wants to play, and really hates the state of Trials.

fryla7,vivereFerrari,"How much does Full Court on the ""new"" Interference VI buff your damage?","By my math, I'm getting roughly 15%, at ***extreme*** ranges. 

My method: I was just doing The Ether Servitor public event on Nessus on Watchers Grave. 

Everyone is familiar with the distance the servitor travels between 'jumps' around that central circle. 

I was standing where the servitor had just left, near the big stone blocks. It teleported across the circle, closest to that cave-type area. That's a fairly good distance between myself and the target.

I was using a Interference VI with Full Court. And when I was firing those long shots, I was hitting for **1170**. 

The next teleport was back to the center of the circle, which basically cut the distance between the servitor and me by half. My damage only dropped to **1011**. 

This is a decrease of 159 damage, or if you reverse it and round it to a percentage, it's about a **14-15% damage buff.** 

The distance, admittedly, is UNKNOWN. But it was so far I was having to aim a good 20-30 feet ***above the servitor*** in order to hit it, and it's a BIG target. But my point is, having to aim THAT far above the servitor to arc the shot, I would guess that's the max effective range for the buff, because after that, you're not going to realistically be able to hit a target accurately, unless it's something HUGE, like a Gatekeeper size or larger Minotaur, a big servitor, or a Fallen walker.

fryf3o,TheDarkMythic,High-skill Players vs. Casual Players in PvP. Who is right?,"So, this weekend, as I'm sure many of you experienced/are aware of, was somewhat of a repeat from the Astral Horizon weekend in that many top tier players farmed casual ones for tokens. Many of said top tiers are arguing that it's not their fault for exploiting a flaw in the reward system, and many casual players are saying the opposite. Before delving into this, I would like to say that I am a casual player. My tendency is thus towards other casual players. 

Anyhow, this is not the first time that we, as a community, have had this kind of argument. Sure, it has taken many forms across the lifespan of the series, but the question is this: if there is a flaw in the game that allows players to jump across skill gaps and earn extra rewards, be it by using a cheese weapon or trials farming, are the effects of exploiting that flaw fault of the player or Bungie?

Let's look at the Last Word for example. Casual players loved the Last Word because it allowed them to jump skill gaps and take on players of a higher skill level. This meant more rewards in the comp playlist by extension and gave the casual players a sense of power they didn't really have in other gunfights. From this, the argument of whether the players are simply spammers who have no respect for real skill or those simply exploiting an advantage in the game can be seen. High-skill players, unsurprisingly, wanted Last Word nerfed in its ADS with its hip fire perks maintained, so that they would stop losing gunfights they thought they shouldn't have lost. They argued that anything which allows jumps in skill gaps in gunfights should be nerfed because that doesn't represent the true skill of the player using the weapon. Casual players, equally as unsurprisingly, wanted it to be kept the same so that they could win more gunfights and more loot. They argued that they should be allowed a fighting chance at players who would otherwise dominate them.

Now let's look at the latest controversy: the trials token farming. Many of those who have gone flawless the past weekend have opted to keep reseting their passages to farm tokens in easier matches. This means more rewards in Trials by extension and gives them a better advantage and thus more of a feeling of power in other playlists and Trials when they finally got that roll they were looking for. Casual players hate this because it means they don't get as much loot as they would have otherwise gotten from their passage. High-skill players argue that Trials is essentially a gatekeeping gamemode anyways, and that the point of the activity is to weed out those who are not skilled enough to pass that gate, too. Therefore, does it matter if players who would lose later end up losing sooner?

From this, I have come up with the following conclusion for both sides to listen to. Are you listening? Okay, here goes...

&amp;#x200B;

STOP BEING SELFISH AND HYPOCRITICAL

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, yes, you heard me right. At some point, we as a community are going to have to realize that even if you are using an exploit presented to you, using it to make another player's day suck in exchange for your own happiness is selfish. Using a litany of weapons I could spend a whole day listing, casual players have beaten out players they didn't deserve to beat out, crossing the skill gap to claim rewards owed to someone of higher skill. And, high-skill players, exploiting a flaw in the reward system, have crossed the skill gap to get more tokens (and happiness in getting a god roll faster) by moving the gatekeeping of Trials closer to the beginning of the passage for casual players. In doing so, they have claimed rewards faster for making another person's day suck for their own happiness. Both actions are equally as selfish and wrong. Overall, crossing the skill gap to punish players of either side so you can get more loot/be more happy is just fundamentally wrong.

In the case of Last Word and other ""cheese"" weapons, I know that all players, especially casual ones, are going to be inclined towards doing anything possible to win a high-stakes match or optimize how much loot you are getting. And while you could make the argument that higher skill players are getting more PvP loot anyways and its only fair for you to get as much loot, at the end of the day, you are still crossing the skill gap with a shortcut to gain loot. Also, if you instead used weapons that rewarded better play for better skills, you wouldn't be stuck in the same level of skill or be emotionally crushed when these weapons inevitably get nerfed. Just be nice and try to improve your skill naturally instead of giving yourself the equivalent of steroids. Those skilled players are almost guaranteed to have sunk insane amounts time and sweat into getting to where they are now, and it's not right for you to be able to bypass that process by using cheese weapons.

In the case of the trials tokens, I also know that hardcore, high-skill players are going to want to find the perfect god roll so they can have more fun in what is to them a PvP that is constantly on the verge of being stale. Plus, you also want to have every possible option on the table for a match, and something like Astral Horizons is very appealing in that regard. Here's the thing though. If you are a high-skill player in Destiny 2, you are probably not a player whose grind is inhibited by strict time restraints. Let's be honest. Do you really need to have that god roll as soon as possible? Trials is around for more days of the week than when it's not around, and I'm sure missing one god perk on your Astral Horizons isn't going to affect your gameplay that much. Just be nice and play Trials the way it's meant to be played instead of crushing those who aspire to be like you one day. Many of them don't even want to get to flawless, they just want to maybe get to 3 wins and call it a day. Yeah, they're still going to face a gate, but placing that gate closer to the beginning of the passage means a lot less loot and happiness for the casual player.

I am tired of seeing both sides whine when their loot is taken away for someone else to be happy before doing the exact same thing to the other side in what is sometimes literally days. Bungie is always going to have some error that people can exploit to their benefit and the detriment of others. That's just how a complex game with such a merged PvE and PvP like Destiny works. Accepting that, we, even when presented the opportunity to, should ignore our selfish tendency to exploit something and hurt someone else and try to be altruistic instead. If the community tried to be more altruistic instead of selfish, if crossing the skill gap using shortcuts was universally agreed to be shameful, and that those who do so ought to be shamed, maybe people wouldn't use cheese weapons as much and maybe high-skill players wouldn't be farming casual players for tokens as much right now.",14,1585599606,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fryf3o/highskill_players_vs_casual_players_in_pvp_who_is/,DestinyTheGame,1
fryedc,Kyren11,We constantly see posts of what Eververse shouldn't be. Here's my suggestion on what it has been and should return to again!,"There are plenty of excellent Eververse items that belonged there and were exactly what the community is asking for. Here are some examples for future reference.

*Suros Regime's Basilisk's Glory: an awesome looking ornament that was purely cosmetic and completely untied to anything in Destiny and everyone wanted it anyways. Hint: changing it blue and selling the original white as an ornament was the complete opposite of what it should be.

* One Eyed Mask's Jian Ornament. Makes a scary looking ornament look really cool. Not tied to any event or activity, not necessary for the exotic to still work as intended.

* Mini Sparrow: it was hilarious, absurd, and spawned one of my favorite Destiny fan videos: https://youtu.be/ur29privaXo

* Burnout Sparrow: like Ghost Rider and Destiny had a baby. Not themed to any one part of Destiny, looks awesome, great to show off.

* Phalanx Shell: looks awesome, destiny themed, completely absurd, not tied to any specific activity or event. Very noticeable. Perfect to show off.

* Pretty much all ship transmat animations.

The fact is that Eververse can have a very useful, very profitable place in Destiny. To create a place to get the absurd, the outlandish, the flashy, and the completely unnecessary cosmetics to take your Guardian to the next level. What are your favorite pieces of Eververse content that deserved to be there?

Tl:dr Eververse has created content that deserves to be there and instead of complaining about what it shouldn't be, we should show Bungie what stuff we like and want to see more of!",0,1585599543,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fryedc/we_constantly_see_posts_of_what_eververse/,DestinyTheGame,1

I can no longer play and feel lost in their worlds. 

I’ve played once in the last two weeks and I made it as far as the tower before deciding to exit the game. I’ve recently taken to Assassins Creed Odyssey and have 36 hours into that already. 

I like many am hoping that things change. If not next season, then maybe in the fall hopefully. It’s just a shame given how much free time everyone has currently that this is how many of us feel.

frxh24,FarOutPunkRocker,Raids need some reworking and some love.,"     I haven't really played much D2 recently and Shadowkeep got me interested solely for the raid that came with. As much as I enjoyed Garden of Salvation I feel that raids in D2 are in a pretty poor spot.
     First let me say that I just don't get that sensation that what I'm doing matters. When I play through the raids in Destiny 2 I know the rewards are pretty much useless (especially the armour) and even the reasoning behind the raids are becoming foggy. I couldn't even tell you the reason or story behind Garden of Salvation, or really any of the raids in this game besides Last Wish.
     A little about the story in this game, I am ashamed to see how quickly Bungie is willing to forgo story development to ""better"" other aspects of the game, this has unintentionally, I feel, leaked into the raids. We have so many big names in the lore and none of them are being tackled, instead they just keep adding new faces that coagulate the story even more. So firstly as a big lore guy in D1 I wish for a stronger narrative and a more meaningful one at that.
     The second and probably larger issue are the rewards. I remember seeing people decked out in full Vault gear in D1, seeing a Warlock in full Crota gear made you revere that player but I also remember that slowly dissapearing in that game too. So this isn't really a new issue, but one that has been amplified due to time and volume of content. Raid gear and exotics feel absolutely meaningless. For the older raids it is literally true but for newer ones the gear just isn't up to standards. Remember Fatebringer? Word of Crota? Hunger of Crota? Blackhammer? Hezens Vengeance? Vex Mythoclast? What happened to difficult activities giving out powerful rewards? It was bungies pandering to newer audiences and complete neglect of their older fans in early D2, now it's more an issue of trying to balance everything but in this attempt to make a fair game for all gear drops have become meaningless.
     As a last point I just want to state that the raid layout and boss fights are getting rather old too. I know this is difficult to change but I feel that new mechanics can only go so far, as well as the damage boss phase, immune phase, damage boss phase, immune phase, last stand, etc. As a solution let me give some examples on how I would fix this.
     1.) Add dynamic boss fights. Perhaps the boss flies around, maybe they burrow underground, run around wildly, separate the players or cloak the entire field in fog, just something that not only makes it fun but makes it unique and memorable. 
     2.) More transitional segments and non-boss encounters. The Leviathan is an example of taking this step too far, Kings Fall is a perfect example of how to do this correctly. I personally want more encounters like The Door before the Warpriest, the maze before Golgoroth, the vault in Last Wish, or raising the spire in Vault. These are sometimes the best part of a raid and help pace the entire run. Last Wish is another great example of this. As a side note I feel that this needs to be paired with more boss encounters too.
     3.) Longer raids with more encounters. I feel Kings Fall is a lot of peoples favourite raid for one major reason, the aestethic and the volume of encounters. It felt like you were dungeon crawling your way to the big bad at the end, every time you think you're about to end it there is another encounter and each one is unique and helps further your experience. This is why Raid Lairs never worked for me, they were too short and not varied enough. Although fun it didn't feel like a raid.
     4.) Meaningful rewards. It is difficult to fix this issue and maintain a balanced experience but raid drops are seriously lacking. I personally want stronger gear to reflect the journey I just undertook. If rewards have to undergo a reduced drop rate for this to exist I'd be fine, another thing Bungie could do is make all raids meaningful again like they were at the end of D1. I just want more things to do in this game, why are old raids just forgotten about?",7,1585596702,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frxh24/raids_need_some_reworking_and_some_love/,DestinyTheGame,1

frx97h,The_Rick_14,Weekly Bright Dust Source Compromise,"First things first, I completely get the weekly limit and to an extent I get trying to convince people to play modes you haven't touched in quite some time, but needing to play different ""Core Activities"" to get Bright Dust is killing the fun of the game for me.

I hate that I often feel like I can't run a raid with friends or can't play the new seasonal activity because I need to run 3 strikes to finish the strike bounties instead or I'll get zero bright dust (I know, I know ""Just buy Silver #forehead....."").

So how about a compromise. Keep the weekly 3600 bright dust limit from activities (the daily bounties can stay how they are too) but remove the restriction of WHICH activities need to be done.

Currently the Weekly Bounties seem to take me on average:

* 4 strikes (because often the playlist won't give me a strike I need for the bounty...Fallen bosses anyone?)
* 4 crucible matches
* 3 gambit matches

for a total of 11 activities per character so 33 total activities. For the 3600 bright dust that gives, that's roughly **110 bright dust per activity**.

How about we make it exactly that? Regardless of the activity, your first 11 activity completions on each character each give you 110 bright dust.

I know a counter argument will be that people will just find the quickest activity to grind but so what? That's the whole point of the weekly cap.

I just want to be back to where we were before the weekly bright dust bounties were a thing and any activity I played was also a means towards earning Bright Dust too and I didn't feel bad for playing the activities that I enjoy more.",0,1585596038,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frx97h/weekly_bright_dust_source_compromise/,DestinyTheGame,1

frx3tt,Masterwork_Core,Discussion about how destiny campaigns are/were made (narrative),"I was listening to D1 and D2 soundtracks lately and it did bring up some memories not gonna lie (remembrance, the Warmind, etc.) It made me think of how campaigns were handled back then and how they are now. I'm not talking about the quality of the story itself (although feel free to do so in comments), but rather how it was made. Most mmo's follow the same pattern with their ''zones''. Let'S take D1 vanilla campaign for example (if i do any mistake let me know its been a while). You can apply this concept to pretty much any mmo. You normally do an intro mission in a zone, normally to introduce the new enemy, the new chapter of the story, new allies, the antagonist of the zone (optional) etc. (in encounter design thats where the game will introduce you a new enemy one by one ''dregs, vandals, then captains,etc.''). then you do a couple mission there as well and patrol the zone doing quests and such (the size of that part depends on the size of the game (wow vs D1 isnt same size obviously lol). then you finish that zone with a dungeon (in D1 it would be a strike, think Sepiks prime to finish the cosmodrome story) and an epilogue to send you to the next one (next destination in destiny). 

&amp;#x200B;

I really did like that way of constructing the story. Of course D1 vanilla story is known not for being super incredible but thats not the point. I loved that each destinations were their own chapter and ended with a final mission for each. Shadowkeep kinda brought that back, making us do the scarlet keep mission. 

I remember in D2y1 a lot of people, myself included, complained that the new strikes were story missions, but if bungie instead removed those story missions and instead were simply ''complete A Garden World/Tree Of Probabilities strike'', people wouldnt have been as pissed, since it wouldve been the same way as using a dungeon in any mmo to complete a story chapter. Instead they just reused it for strikes. I don't mind side story strikes at all (we pretty much only have that as strikes besides those i mentioned) but I kinda miss that ''final fight'' feel of finishing a story chapter with a strike, just like finishing a main story in a raid (Taken King). 

Replacing those reskinned story missions by asking players to complete that strike instead of doing a story mission version + a strike version would save time and look a bit better in the eyes of players as it doesnt look like obvious reskinned content. I know it wouldnt fix the game issues but hey it's just something i preferred, story wise. 

Let's say in forsaken, after completing the first mission and then meeting the spider and all that and being ready to kill the barons, Petra asks of us to contain the prison of elders since the riot and we need to control it to avoid any more trouble. ''complete warden of nothing strike'' she sends us there and drifter is the one who welcomes us via radio. Of course maybe at that point we didnt even met him yet but that could be tweaked lol. 

Look i don't have the perfect answer or the perfect fix and besides its not even a suggestion but just something i wanted to share with all of you. I'm curious to see what are your thoughts on how the story is built into the game (outside of story quality, although feel free to share).

tldr: i loved that in d1, strikes were more included in the story and served as a final mission for each destination before jumping to the next one and all that without reskinning story mission for later like we got in d2",0,1585595590,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frx3tt/discussion_about_how_destiny_campaigns_arewere/,DestinyTheGame,1

frx1bl,MouthOSalt,Curse of Osiris is infinitely better than Season of the Worthy,"To preface, I understand during CoO Bungie had Activision and their studios backing the game's development and now since Bungie is technically an indie company I do understand some changes needed to be made. But still, I would want to make a comparison between CoO and Worthy. Here goes:

I haven't even mentioned everything I have to say about the comparison between the two. For the Traveller's sake, Bungie if you can even get half of what CoO was. Then I would congratulate you. But this season is genuinely disappointing and even if I hop on, I hesitate after realizing how little content we are being fed and the low replayability of the seasonal activity.

Who thought a lovechild between EP and forges was a good idea as the mode that we are gonna keep going back to? No one ever wanted a loop of upgrading 3 Bunkers (aka Obelisk x7) that is scattered til mid April. How was moving some weapons from ToO from D1 to D2 and adding some cool glow effects cause the complete termination of ritual weapons?

Please Bungie, you have royally screwed up this season. The future for guardians to come are not bright.

P.S. So weapon retirement is to give us players an incentive to use weapons presented in that season. Then giving us crap ""god"" rolls are not going to change our minds from using Mtntop, Recluse, Anarchy. I was fine with weapon retirement. But if water guns are what we have to use against future raid encounters and bosses, no thanks.",15,1585595383,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frx1bl/curse_of_osiris_is_infinitely_better_than_season/,DestinyTheGame,1

---

Guardians can count on Zavala. The stoic commander of the Vanguard is always on hand for an encouraging word (and some fresh bounties) each time they visit the Tower. With Season of the Worthy, Zavala has his hands full, fighting alongside Ana Bray to save the Last City from the Almighty’s deadly collision course.


It begs the question: With all of this turmoil going on, how does Zavala relax? We already know that (according to Destiny lore) he likes his knitting and crocheting. But this week, with the introduction of the Fourth Horseman Exotic quest, Guardians learned about a new personal passion for Zavala: slinging iron and getting a good cardio burn, accompanied by sick beats and a most unusual trainer.


This is the story of the Shaxxercise mixtape. 


[Video Link](https://youtu.be/jPg2MIFUMDg)


[Fitness-related spoilers ahead! You’ve been warned, Guardian!]


The first step in the Fourth Horseman Exotic quest is to visit Zavala’s office, located in a lower level of the Tower Wall. Once you gain access to his office, continue through the back labyrinth of rooms and hallways, make your way into the Vanguard Vault, and continue your search for the famous Exotic shotgun. However, those Guardians who spent time rummaging through Zavala’s office this week eventually found a secret sitting high on one of the shelves – a mixtape of workout music, complete with motivational encouragement from everyone’s favorite Crucible host: Lord Shaxx himself.


So how did this mixtape come about in Season of the Worthy? Like many things, it started as a conversation between friends…


***



##A Passion for Hard Work, I Like That

Bungie’s Kareem Shuman loves his job. As a technical dialogue designer, Kareem works on the Audio team and his job is to help make sure that the dialogue that is written, performed, and recorded sounds as good as possible in the final game. Think of Kareem as a shepherd for the content that makes up the dialogue audio experience. “Music and sound design and dialogue all have to share the same [audio] space,” Kareem said. “It’s my job to get [dialogue] across the finish line, sounding good, and delivering on the fiction and the experience.”


While hanging out one night during a Destiny 2 Crucible session, one of Kareem’s friends commented on how supportive and enthusiastic Shaxx is. She wished she had someone like Shaxx yelling at her when she was trying to stay motivated at the gym.


They laughed about it for a few minutes, but when Kareem came into work the next day, he couldn’t stop the idea from knocking around in his head. He wondered if he could turn the joke into something real in the game. 


How would you make a workout mixtape real in Destiny 2? 


One thing was for sure: a project like this would require work from across the studio. Like all other aspects of Destiny’s development, this would be a team effort, with input and creative ideas from every department, even down to figuring out if a “Shaxx mixtape” was something that Destiny lore could even support.


“I had to talk to [the] Narrative team and make sure they were okay with Zavala having a Shaxx mixtape,” Shuman said. “I didn't want to step on anyone's fictional toes.”


Narrative was fully behind the idea, which meant it wasn’t as crazy as he’d originally thought. Still, to bring this project home, it would take creativity, it would take communication, and it would take teamwork.


But first, it would take some music.


***



##This Is It, Show Me What You’ve Got

The next step was to bring the idea to Bungie music director and composer Skye Lewin, who was immediately onboard. “My first reaction was [that] I laughed out loud and said, ‘Of course we can, let’s do it,’” said Lewin. He brought in Bungie composer Josh Mosser, and the two began discussing which music they could use for the mixtape. They were looking for the kind of tunes that, as Mosser said, would get Guardians in that “I want to get pumped up and run around in Destiny” mindset. 


Shuman also provided the music team with a handful of previously recorded Shaxx voice lines that could be used as motivational inserts while the music was playing. He had spent a good deal of time querying the content stores, looking for Shaxx dialogue (many of which Guardians might recognize from the Crucible) that would work and were funny to boot. It didn’t take long for Mosser to get inspired. 


“I literally sat there and imagined, ‘What would Zavala do at that point?’” Mosser said. “How would he go through a workout? Would he be high intensity the whole time, or [would] he need a moment to take a break?"" After carefully editing the music selections and strategic voice drop-ins, Mosser came back to Shuman with the roughly eight-minute mix that ran the gamut from pounding beats to more contemplative moments (perfect for a brief mid-workout cooldown), all perfectly complemented by Shaxx’s intense vocal stylings. The mixtape consists of numerous separate bits of music, all carefully edited together to tell the ""story"" of the tape.


“One of those pieces could have been 14 minutes by itself,” Lewin said. “So we’re taking musical excerpts, making sure they flow from one piece to the next and then timing the dialogue around the music so the two work well and they tell the story in a way that’s funny.”


Lewin was especially pleased by Mosser’s choice to use the theme from the Ghaul fight for the heart-pounding climax of the mix. “It's like the big payoff for your workout,” Lewin said.


If you ask the team which Shaxx line is their favorite, the vote is almost unanimous – Shaxx furiously demanding for the listener to calm down (“Relax more. I SAID RELAX!”); a moment that is perfectly accompanied by a momentary easing of the musical intensity. 


With the music and voice lines in a good place, there was still the matter of getting it all to work in the game. 


***



##You’re Halfway, Hold Strong!

At this point, Shuman had what amounted to a big audio file, complete with the various tunes and Shaxx voice lines edited into place. A single audio file worked in theory, but there were drawbacks to implementing it in the game, including the need to create separate audio versions for all the languages supported by Destiny 2, as well as making it difficult to integrate with the game’s subtitles system.


The solution was to tie the music to a system called a “dialogue table” which contained all of the selected lines of Shaxx dialogue. Once the player interacted with the mixtape object in the game, the music would kick off and a timer would start, essentially sequencing Shaxx’s voice lines based on timing determined by Shuman in the dialogue table. Now, you could have the music and the voice lines play in perfect synchronization, plus it could be more easily localized and subtitled. 


Now, how were Guardians going to find this mixtape?


***


##One Final Push, Guardian

Eve Campbell, Bungie senior world artist, loves surprises in game worlds. “My favorite thing with any video game is finding secrets. If I play any game that, when I swing a sword and I accidentally hit a wall and the wall disappears and there's a chest, I freak out and I have to hit every wall for the rest of the game.” 


That love of surprise has served Campbell well when creating Zavala’s office and the labyrinth that lead to the Vanguard Vault. Having also worked on missions like Zero Hour and the Banshee-44 workshop pathway for the Leviathan’s Breath quest, this was comfortable territory for her. Designing Zavala’s office was also a chance to expand on the character a bit more. After all, how someone decorates their private spaces can say a lot about them as people. 


Remember how Zavala likes to knit? Look around his office and you’ll see a small knitting kit tucked away on a corner table. Or a set of trophies presented to the commander for his many heroic efforts over the years. Or the set of barbells perched improbably high on the shelf next to the mixtape. And what executive suite wouldn’t be complete with a peaceful (and interactive!) Newton’s Cradle on the desk?


“For the mixtape specifically, we wanted that to be a thing that players discover,” Campbell said about the decision to place it high on a shelf near the office entrance. “We wanted it kind of hidden away a little bit. So we ended up with a jump puzzle to discover it, just so players could have that discovery of it. It feels a little earned.”


***



##Even Steel Needs Sharpening

It’s no surprise that Destiny players found this musical Easter Egg in quick fashion with the weekly reset. The development team has enjoyed seeing the reaction from fans – and the inevitable mixtape remixes that are surely still to come. 


Those Guardians who, in their haste to finish the Fourth Horseman quest, missed it at first can take solace and know that the musical treat is still there, waiting to be found, tucked high away on the upper shelf of Zavala’s office.

frwsvi,sseccatt,The lore/story of Destiny is becoming lackluster atm,"TLDR at the end 
Okay before I get downvoted let me explain, I love lore and I love reading them but right now it’s literally going nowhere. Byf made a video on this but this should be on this subreddit too.

Let’s start with Y3 where it went from “AMAZING” to “MEH”
We started strong with the pyramid and darkness, we got in and even though it had the best opening mission since TTK imo  we had the worst anti-climatic ending ever “we are your salvation” and boom you’re back at Eris again. The garden of salvation raid and story of it was great, I wonder what happened to the Kentarch 3 fireteam mostly because there were no bodies yet we found divinity (a weapon Lisbon held) that was all great and all, then Vex invasion with going to the black garden to try and kill the vex mind everything’s okay.

We go to Season 9, Osiris gets the help from drifter for his sundial to save Saint 14, a city legend known for being the hero of Six fronts. The last time we saw him was in the infinite forest in Curse of Osiris, seeing him dead in a tomb made by the vex themself. We save him, kill the psion sisters and get some nice weapons like devils ruin and bastion great.

Season 10, it’s Rasputin themed and again the cabal being the main enemy faction of this season. With all the data-mined lore we know that Felwinter is the son of Rasputin, that he unleashed Siva because he couldn’t get his son back and that he confesses about these things etc. We get a lot more siva references yet nothing more about the cabal themselves. Are they trying to give us info about season 11 or is something happening right now? Who knows. 

But the thing is, we are missing so much. It’s been almost a year when Uldren got revived, A YEAR! The only update we got was from the dawning ship/sparrow saying that he is somewhere in the EDZ near the city itself. Now we go back to November/December of 2019, we see a cutscene of Eris touching the pyramid and smiling(?!?) what happened? Why is she smiling?! 
We still don’t know. 

Now season 9/start of season 10. We see Osiris coming back from the infinite forest asking Rasputin if he’s on our site or not (this mostly likely has something to do with his confession about his son and Siva and knowing that Felwinter took Osiris as apprentice this could’ve touched him a bit) what happened after this? Nothing. 
We get a lore drop about Osiris asking saint to talk with the house of light (Mithrax, our fallen captain that helped us getting our beloved Outbreak perfected &lt;3 yet still no word from him.

According to Luke smith season 11 is where everything will come together but I really don’t believe this, why? Because Bungie can’t finish an storyline before starting a new one. We have so many storylines in only 1 game already it makes you think we are 3 games further than expected. Uldren, Siviks, Mara, revival of Oryx, Osiris &amp; Rasputin, Saint and Mithrax, Eris morn’s new experiences with the pyramid and the most anticipated story/villain in Destiny right now: 
Savathun, first seen in action in Year 1 with her big ass Shrieker. In year 2 she took the last wish and cursed the Dreaming City, the first big offensive from the taken since Oryx fell. In year 3 she and her taken invaded the vex to gain information about them and we stopped them once again. When is she showing herself? We know she is smarter than Oryx and will most likely not show herself for a long time but this needs to end. 

TLDR: Bungie needs to finish their storylines because it’s getting inconsistent and lackluster. Thanks for reading and have a fine day y’all",8,1585594680,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frwsvi/the_lorestory_of_destiny_is_becoming_lackluster/,DestinyTheGame,1

frwpoz,ntilton,The auto rifle meta is terrible for the health of primary weapons in destiny PvP,"At first, I was really enjoying this auto rifle meta. I though it was refreshing for something other than hand cannons to be at the top of the meta in PvP. Over time, it has become obvious that auto rifles are actually terrible for the meta for a variety of reasons. In reality, they should never be the top of the meta. 

The first reason that auto rifles should not top the meta is that they are by their nature a weapon in the middle of ranges and purposes. The auto rifle has fairly long range, high damage, good accuracy, and minimal recoil. It is supposed to be a weapon that can be used at medium range reliably and that can deal consistent damage. Currently, auto rifles outclass every single primary weapon within their range. 

SMGs and sidearms should be the best weapons you can possibly use other than shotguns at the closest ranges, but the hardlight and the suros can easily kill faster than any SMG in the game, other than recluse while it's perk is active, and even then, the suros regime can kill in roughly the same speed after prefiring for less than a second. The effectiveness of auto rifles has entirely negated the purpose of SMGs, and most sidearms. Some sidearms allow for more aggressive play styles that auto rifles don't so they maintain some relevance. 

Hand cannons are supposed to be weapon that rewards you for your accuracy with a fast time to kill, but now that auto rifles can easily kill significantly faster than hand cannons, and require significantly less skill to do so reliably, hardlight and suros are being used far more than hand cannons at the end of trials passages and at high level comp. A good player with a suros regime or hardlight will not hit a ceiling like they should with weapon like an auto rifle. The easiest and most well rounded weapon should not also be the weapon with almost no skill ceiling, that is obviously not balanced. 

I thought the auto rifle buffs were going to come with buffs to other primary weapons, but instead of giving us a primary weapon meta where skill was rewarded, we have the same shotgun/ sniper meta, but with the easiest weapon category in the game suddenly being the most powerful as well. It has truly dumbed down the way that crucible is played. 

I am not advocating for a nerf to all auto rifles, but if all other primaries aren't buffed, this is going to be the most boring and low-skill PvP meta we've ever seen. 

Long story short: Bungie, you need to buff the forgotten primaries in this game. Scout rifles should cause WAY more flinch to snipers and do more body damage, sidearms and SMGs should do devastating damage at close ranges, 110 hand cannons should have way more range, and 140 hand cannons should 2 head 1 body. The only change that hard light needs is a magazine size reduction, IMO.",35,1585594407,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frwpoz/the_auto_rifle_meta_is_terrible_for_the_health_of/,DestinyTheGame,1

I'm fine with either system individually. Granted, they're not the best options, but they're not horrible. If I have to spend all my tokens now or lose em, ok, and I'll ignore the added FOMO. If I have to unlock access to the engram, aight, I'll live. But both feels unnecessary. 

And for those of you who worry that it makes getting loot to easy, my counter: if you can at least get 3 wins, you'll eventually get everything, so it doesn't really matter. And I'd rather, if we're not going to put some effort into Trials, at least make it feel like you're rewarded for trying. I know we shouldn't compromise, but let's be realistic, I don't think Bungie is going to go the extra mile anymore.

As for a solution, it's obvious, just pick one and drop the other. As to which, I don't know. I (barely) prefer token deleting to engram unlocking. I'd rather get 1 or 2 wins and at least have a chance at a better scout rifle, than 98 tokens and no chance at loot because I kept getting sweats.

frwikd,Opitas_Opus,How Trials SHOULD matchmake,"Of course matchmaking with connection based and card based matches calms the waters, but Trials needs to go one step more to be the true Endgame of PvP. Each different passage should only matchmake with squads of the same passage. This would mean a few things.   

1: Nearly everyone would be matchmade together at the beginning of the weekend, with most everyone choosing the passage of mercy.   

2: Once squads get to five wins, they can get a passage of wealth. Those squads would ONLY go up against those also trying to token farm. This will make it so that squads actually attempting a flawless run will not get stomped by people who only want currency, and are trashing their win every time they get one.   

3: Those using a passage of confidence would have the hardest challenge, since they have already proven they can go flawless that week, and so has each other team they face. Of course, this may deter some from entering, but that would only make the matches more of an actual challenge. Joe and his friends should not face the top three streamers if they only chose a passage of mercy, while the other team is on their fifth passage of confidence this week.       


All of this said, any insight into how to make the system more bearable is appreciated. I have been practicing for around a month for trials, and was the first of anyone I know to hit 1000 power. All of this can't change the fact that every match I go into has people who already went flawless just wanting tokens is truly breaking any hope of making it to the lighthouse, especially if the only flawless rewards I'll get will be the 3 win reward within a week's time.",29,1585593772,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frwikd/how_trials_should_matchmake/,DestinyTheGame,1

frw821,modaareabsolutelygay,The standard to post here is so low that people on both ends of the spectrum often times are just stirring the pot with loose facts to support them,"Most people like my 35 year old friend (I’m just coming out of college for reference), who now have more time to play because they work 24/7 are currently enjoying Destiny. They don’t care about the advancements of Eververse. They don’t care about the lack of PvE content season to season. They don’t care that it’s time gated seasons and the loot disappears at the end of the season. They don’t care Trials is literally the same exact thing (But worse actually) and was irrelevant to remove at this point. But those people are not good reference points at all for a multitude of reasons. 

As for the flip side (which is the majority of the reddit right now) most of the time, they just start spewing and spewing with no real pedigree in how the Video Game field runs, or how programming and Development cycles work. I saw a post last week that said “Bungie it’s been a week and a half, why hasn’t XXX been fixed”...it got over 5k upvotes...(I will link it if I find it again) The “ra ra” haters just flock to upvote and that’s the type of stirring the pot I’m talking about. 

And while I agree, Destiny is not in a good place at all right now, Bungie doesn’t exactly have a plethora of resources and capital anymore. I think a lot of negativity is actually a **good thing** because it wakes anyone up who is receiving it, especially when the pressure is constantly on. **But stupid negativity** is not a positive thing, and as such you’ll see that cozmo and dmg only respond to the carefully crafted posts that dissect everything that’s wrong with Destiny with a fine tooth comb in a respected manner. 

Look, in a perfect world, you’d Ideally want:

-**someone** that has played the game consistently since the beginning of Destiny, but not “burnt out type” consistently
-**someone** who has an understanding of the gaming world, professionally, academically and personally
-**someone** who plays a variety of games (Which goes along with being burnt out)
-**someone** who has an understanding of programming and dev cycles
-**someone** that can be competitive in all aspects of Destiny
-**someone** that actually likes this type of genre to begin with
-**someone** that can convey their thoughts clearly, concisely and in a respected manner 


Unfortunately there isn’t many people like that. And it’s not to say if you don’t check off all those boxes your opinion isn’t valid, it’s just most likely not as valid as someone that does, and it constantly clutters this sub. The point of posting this is that I wish there were a way to sort out the “nonsense” so to speak so there is just high-quality feedback that is constantly being looked at by dmg and Cozmo so they can do their jobs more efficiently, especially in a time like this.",133,1585592862,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frw821/the_standard_to_post_here_is_so_low_that_people/,DestinyTheGame,1

frw6uo,Janaquim,World Drops in Season of The Worthy - A Missed Opportunity,"Hey everyone, 

First off, I hope you and your loved ones are doing well amidst all the craziness that's going around the world right now. With so much more important stuff going on, it's kinda strange to be talking about a video game and writing critical pieces on reddit about it. So, hope you don't mind and hope that you can take something out of this.

I came here today because I’d like to discuss how the loot added to the pool of world drops was a complete missed opportunity and how it could’ve been used to bring some life into the core activities in the game in Season of the Worthy. As usual, if you'd rather hear me talk instead of listening, you can check the video version of the text below, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At8BHz38TPg).

**1.** **The Problems**

Besides trials, seraph, Iron Banner and season pass loot, every other “new” weapon and various “new” armor sets were added to the game as world drops. We went from 20 to 29 weapons and from 3 armor sets per class to 12. This means world drops ballooned from 35 possible drops per class to 89. I have no issues with the addition of a lot of loot, but the way these pieces were added to the game pose a few issues.

**1.1. Issue #1**

First, due to how big the number of items is in relation to the number of armor pieces, the probability of getting the exact weapon you want is really slim - and assuming these all have the same probability of dropping. Weapons are now 33% of the entire pool of world drops per character class (warlock, hunter, titan), down from 57% last season. This also means that the probability of getting the exact piece of loot you want went from 2,86% per drop last season to 1,12% this one. So over a 60% decrease.

**1.2. Issue #2**

Second, the probability of getting the exact roll you want for a specific gun or armor piece decreased tremendously. Using The Old Fashioned as an example, last season, you had a 0,0018% probability of getting the exact roll you wanted or 0,09% probability of getting the gun with the traits you wanted. While this season this deceased to 0,0006% and 0,03%, respectively.

**1.3. Issue #3**

Lastly, while this huge amount of loot was added to a pool that already had too many items, other areas of the game were completely neglected. Strikes, Crucible and Gambit Classic have been living off of seasonal pinnacle weapons for well over a year, and as of lately, ritual weapons. This season, Bungie decided to abandon this model completely, leaving the core activities of the game without any new incentives to be played for the very first time in Destiny 2’s history, since Forsaken.

So, the core activities have no new reason to be played while the greatest infusion of loot this season was done to a single loot source that was already too big, making it almost impossible for you to get any of the rolls you want for the guns you’re going after or the armor pieces you love the looks of. In the words of Luke Smith “we ultimately create a ton of gear that doesn’t have any value beyond ticking the box on the “I Got It” checklist.” I couldn’t agree more.

Even though Bungie might have had a lot of great reasons to abandon ritual weapons for this season, the fact is that they completely mismanaged the new loot added to the game, since it could’ve been used in a more interesting way to bolster excitement for the core activities of the game, since world drops got new additions in Season of Dawn.

**2.** **Possible Solutions**

The weapons could’ve been distributed between Strikes, Crucible and Classic Gambit, while the armor sets could’ve been added to the various lost sectors in the game that don’t have any specific legendary loot drops or only have guns as drops, so we could target farm the specific sets we love the looks of the most.

In conjunction with the fact that we have no ritual weapons for the core activities of the game this season, and that there have been a lot of players desperately requesting for vendor refreshes for quite some time, spreading the weapons out between core activities was an easy slam dunk that could've given real incentives to play the playlists - and as a side effect, soften the blow of the ritual-weapon removal.

When it comes to weapons, these could've been added as exclusive end-of-activity rewards that you couldn't get any other way, respecting Bungie’s design philosophy that when you give vendors tokens, you only get weapons themed after them, bringing back some level of excitement for end-of-activity screens. 

Nine new weapons were added to world drops: 5 primaries, 2 special, and 2 heavy. Based on the types of weapons in the loot pool for each of the 3 core activities, and by trying to add more options to each one and not have weapon types (archetypes) repeated as much as possible, I'd break them down as such:

**Crucible:** Dire Promise, Distant Tumulus, Timeline's Vertex 

**Vanguard:** Escape Velocity, Jian 7 Rifle, Honor's edge 

**Classic Gambit:** True Prophecy, Enigma's Draw, Interferance VI 

By adding Dire Promise as an exclusive crucible drop, for example, but only as a drop and something you could not get with tokens, we could start having those Eyasluna moments Luke mentioned in the latest Director's Cut. So, with this simple move, Bungie could’ve boosted the core activities, and made the new loot way more valuable and attainable, which would all work together to give players different levels of aspiration … you know, Bungie’s goals for the future of the game.

**3.** **But What About Bungie's Goals?**

Given what Luke Smith mentioned in the latest Director's Cut, what was done here goes against pretty much everything Bungie seems to be targeting as their main focus for the future of the game: core activities, making loot valuable, and creating aspiration.

Core activities were left to dry pretty hard. This collection of new loot is less valuable than ever, and aspiration is being cut from the game because of how the loot was added. With such a big pool of world drops, and as players don’t get the pieces of gear they want and the rolls they are looking for, players will end up feeling way less interested in getting them as time goes by.

With so much going against the player here as I demonstrated in terms of probabilities, I believe it’s a hard to keep the perceived time investment for these world drops high for a mid-to-long period of time, which will not help in keeping players engaged with the game past the novelty phase.

And let's not forget that because of the future retirement of loot, the more time it goes by without a player getting the piece of gear they want or a specific perk combination, the less valuable it will be for them to keep playing in the hopes of getting them, completely killing off aspiration.

It's great to see this loot back in the game, but given how it was handled and how its potential was squandered, it feels rather pointless.

**4. Final Thoughts**

I understand that it must really hard to direct a game of this size and a team of such talent. The problem here isn't lack of talent. The problem here is lack of vision - I'm gonna make an assumption next, but I think it's a pretty safe one and I hope I'm not being unfair. 

The same amount of work done to add this loot to the game as world drops could've been done to add them to the core activities in the game and others like Lost Sectors. This is something Bungie already does with the weapons you get from the season pass, where they're added to Crucible, Vanguard, and Gambit as possible end-of-activity rewards. So if they do this to these guns, why not do the same for the new world drops? Why not use them to bolster the core activities in the game? 

And then there's ritual weapons. Bungie must've known that removing ritual weapons wouldn't sit well with the community. So why not do this to soften the blow?  


Thanks a bunch for reading, and hope you have a brilliant day and week, :)

It better not be funding your stupid other game you said you were working on. I think I can speak for many players when I say that we spend our money on destiny to hopefully improve destiny, NOT to fund another game that has nothing to do with destiny...

frw51x,DrPogo2488,"I’m Confused as to Why the Io Bunker Isn’t Opening on Tuesday, as, Apparently Being the Crux of This Season, Shouldn’t They Opening Sequentially to Establish a Base/Tone to Expand Everything Else On?","So the first week, we got the EDZ Bunker, which was new and fresh and didn’t make us see how bare-bones this season was yet. Everyone played, tried to see what the upgrades did and what you could get from them all.

Then that luster fades when the Moon Bunker comes out as everyone had 2000-3000 Bits from playing Trials, and on DAY 1 MOON BUNKER, I loaded into the moon over 10 times and there was not one person doing the public event. LLS Can be done Solo; after I got the Horseman Catalyst Day 1, I solo’d all the EDZ and Moon LLS (not a flex, staying a fact). Now it all seems pointless, but Ana has some
Shit to say, there was a new area in the game matching concept art...

Then Bungie Mothballs the final Bunker for no reason? Shouldn’t they have released them sequentially, weekly, so as to at LEAST convince us that there was a deeper narrative in the season dealing with the obvious bunker focal points? I checked the road map today and it was staggering to see that there is another entire week of nothing before the Io Bunker. 

I want this season to prove to be awesome, I want there to be an underlying event, secret puzzle, or awesome story that displays itself, but I’m just questioning why this was done this way. I’m one of the idiots that says “give them time, Bungie usually reveals their plan if we give them a chance” even if the giant plan blows, but this I just find dumb. The next few weeks are time that everyone could have fun in bunkers and rank up and learn more of the story before Guardian Games and the whatnot takes over the season. 

WITH THREE fucking new seals, it’s be nice to be able to make stopgap progress in at least one before everything collectively comes out and it’ll be impossible to find anyone on the same path as they are via LFG.",12,1585592595,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frw51x/im_confused_as_to_why_the_io_bunker_isnt_opening/,DestinyTheGame,1

frvs8k,Spyro_0,Right now it feels like Bungie is leaching money from Destiny 2 and funding something else.,"Right now Christopher Barret has on his Twitter [redacted] Game Director @Bungie. Clearly they have something else going on. 

This season the main content is throwing balls and lost sectors. Something we’ve done before, there’s pretty much no new content. For years the forums have cried out for strike scoring, skeleton keys, factions like D1, enemy themed loot, less in Eververse, loot to matter when it drops and a whole load of more. 

This season pass is about testing the breaking point of how little effort they can put in while still making money. They then take this money and instead of reinvesting into the game I believe it’s going elsewhere, funding whatever else is going on there. We don’t even have ritual weapons because trials weapons came with this season.. I don’t want to be someone who pretends to know all about 3D rendering in game engines but I would’ve been happy with 3 reskinned guns with good rolls and a new paint job. 

This kinda turned into a rant but I just want this game to fulfil its potential, no game out there feels like Destiny. No game has ‘those moments’ (hero moments). No game pulls people back time and time again like this game does. I just came back after a 3 week break just to shoot things with dragonfly because it feels good. We’re mad because we care about this game and we want it to be the best it can be, not a shell of a AAA game modelled like a mobile game leaching money for minimal effort.",17,1585591460,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frvs8k/right_now_it_feels_like_bungie_is_leaching_money/,DestinyTheGame,1
frvpw6,ComradePoolio,Warlock's entire arc subclass relies too much on exotics to be effective.,"Stormcaller is an ad-clear super at heart, yet it's low duration and low damage mean it's practically useless for that job unless you're using Crown of Tempests. With the recent nerf, imagine teleporting even once with top tree and then trying to take care of ads. You'd be out in no time at all. This reliance means that the super can't really be used effectively with any other exotic. That chestpiece that raises damage for each target killed seems really cool, sadly my super is too short to ever appreciate it. Any job base Stormcaller can do, base bottom tree Dawnblade can do and be left with 50-75% of it's super because of everlasting flame. I'd even argue that Nova Warp does a better job at ad clear now than Stormcaller. 

My second issue with the subclass is Chaos Reach. Chaos Reach doesn't do much at all without Geomag, which transforms a brief splurt into an attempt at DPS. Problem with this is, even with Geomag, Warlocks do a fraction of the damage of a single celestial nighthawk with a super that takes 15x as long and leaves you vulnerable the whole time. You could argue that you can hit multiple things with chaos reach, which you can, but it's not really encouraged. It's clearly not an ad-clear super, and with Geomag every second you're not doing constant damage is reducing your super uptime. 

Dawnblade, Well of Radiance, Nova Bomb, and Nova Warp (though I still see this one as useless) do not require an exotic to use them effectively, their exotics merely add some neat benefits.",10,1585591273,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frvpw6/warlocks_entire_arc_subclass_relies_too_much_on/,DestinyTheGame,1

frvghv,10v3TT,Bungie the player base wants to play the way they want,"Throughout all of the salt posts one aspect is clear, the player wants to feel powerful.  Whether that is by using whatever weapons they want or cool builds they want and are slightly broken, the players want to feel powerful.  The lack of content, new raids, is very troubling especially when the only way to get pinnacles is to do the “new” Garden of Salvation raid, which is extremely difficult on ps4 and the final boss fight feels impossible to complete with a lfg raid group.  This is not the case with Last Wish or Scourge because there are so many dps options and the FPS don’t drop to abysmal levels.  With the changes to snipers (lowering the dps) it feels terrible, atleast to a casual player. I’ve loved destiny for a while; however, the recent changes in content updates have been driving my friends from the game.  I miss the raid nights with the boys, I miss the chilling and slaying out in the crucible, playing EP grinding for that godly shotty.  But now I don’t feel compelled to play because it feels like you are chaining us to specific load outs with champion mods not being allowed on exotics.  I’m tired of having to use weapons that I hate using simply because “there are barrier champions” or unstoppable champions, yes the artifact mods can make you feel super powerful; however, I can see how people don’t like a current seasons meta simply because the artifact support only one way of playing.  

When I watched the Shadowkeep reveal I was filled with excitement because I thought that the game was only going to get better.  But the lack of powerful sources (raids that matter more than their specific exotic) frustrates me.  I’ve tried the GoS boss fight atleast 50 attempts; however, I’ve never completed it simply due to the fact that people leave after failing for so long.  Where has the mentality that the go fast update brought gone?  Where has the mentality that players should be powerful and feel powerful gone?  I’ve played this game and put so many hours on it, even during CoO, and yet now I’m feeling like I don’t want to play this game because trials isn’t fun getting stomped every round. GoS feels like a chore that I simply refuse to touch anymore because of the boss fight.  The strike champions infuriate me when one or both of my randoms don’t use mods so I’m left to switch my load out and deal with them.  Crucible can be a salt field and gambit isn’t fun to play. 

And yet I still get on atleast once a week to play, but I don’t enjoy it as much as I used to.  I want to feel powerful, I want to use whatever I want to, and I want to play what I want to.  

Tldr: As a casual player I want the opportunity to play whatever way that I want and do whatever I want and the way that this seasonal structure is going it doesn’t feel like they are embracing the “play the way you want” moto.",29,1585590459,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frvghv/bungie_the_player_base_wants_to_play_the_way_they/,DestinyTheGame,1

frv7f4,Itsyaboifam,What seasons should have been,"I will start off by saying that a actually like conceptually the season model... mainly the aspects that limit the droughts, and that its stories are interconected... but there is a severe problem in the gameplay and content aspects of it... I recently talked to my clan while raiding on what they think Destiny season should look like.... here are some of the ideas brought up

***PVE***

**Season shouldnt be about one activity, it should be about the world**

Seasonal activities need to go... what we actually need are changes to world around us, that are in context with the seasons story.

Imo each season brought something good to the model, but that independently doesnt work... 

Undying made patroling feel like the world was being invaded, but Imo needed to be less random and happen in larger scales (happen all the time on every part of the map),

Season of dawn brought the obelisks (which added a different type of grind)

Season of worthy is trying to evolve the world by making its main activity be on patrol (sadly it is in only one part of the map, and it is a very simple activity)

Each one of these aspects have value to them, but alone they dont work... so, with this in mind, what should a season be like?

***The season starts***... lets say it is centered around the resurgence of oryx (his ressurection on the moon).

While patrolling on some planets (earth, moon, and titan, with changes to their geometry and skybox), there would constatly be rituals trying to gather dark energy (I aint no lore master, but a simple man) to bring oryx back to life and his full glory. The ritual would have lots of hive swarming you, while you are trying to destroy a couple of hive wizards, which would drop you a buff (dark overflowing), allowing you to destroy some hive crystals, the skybox has a huge hive mark in it where they syphon that energy. There wouldnt be any fail mechanics or a timer per say, but if you didnt stop the ritual you wouldnt get any loot... basically vex invasions, but would actually offer xp equivalent to 3 repeatable bounties

After clearing these rituals, you would get not only new weapons exclusive to that activity, but the seasonal currency (dark essence) to be spend on the planets vendor, (moon: the lectern, earth: deverim, titan: sloane), they would be the equivalent of obelisk and bunkers, and wouldnt offer any repeatable bounties, but only weekly and daily... 

You spend ur currency on ur respective vendor, get some awesome new seasonal mods... but now you need something else to do... You go to orbit and there would be new playlists of strikes. The first one would be ***""oryx ressurgence playlist""***  a compilation of some strikes contextualized in the new season, on titan Savathuns song would have been ressurected to help in the process of gathering dark energy, but instead of purple balls mechanic, we would have the hive ritual mechanic already mentioned. On earth we would have the lake of shadows strike, but instead of a taken only infestation it would be hive and taken, with the taken phalanx and a big ass hive knight in the end... Another one would be a Skarlet keep  re-made within the season context (we had some ideas, but tbh it isnt really hard to add new mechanics to these strikes)... the last one would be a new strike available later in the season, where we take down an weakened oryx and end his ressurgence (these strikes would drop the new seasons loot in them, different than the loot dropped on patrols)... the other ""new"" playlist would be an ordeal version of these strikes plain and simple...

When the oryx strikes drop, the patrol activity changes from syphoning dark energy, to trying to open a portal for oryx to spread his influence... Rather than killing cristals with the wizards buffs, there would be new bosses (can rotate weekly) that have mechanics that revolve around the wizard buffs (a lesser escalation protocol wave 7)

Aside from these, a new batch of exotics (armor and 2 quests), season pass included


This is just the main line of thought we would want bungie to go through, these were only examples, and were very in line with what I think bungie can produce considering the content we got these last few seasons, but TBH this way seasons feel more engaging, with familiar activities in mind, updates on patrols, vendors, loot, skybox and even strikes, instead of another menagerie wannabe being developed for the season, or a lackluster throw the ball simulator...",4,1585589651,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frv7f4/what_seasons_should_have_been/,DestinyTheGame,1

frv19f,Das-98,Favorite Destiny Missions,"Hey! I came back to destiny again after stopping just as Shadowkeep was announced for personal reasons...  
I made a new Warlock, and I am playing (rushing) through the Red War, Osiris and Warmind DLCs, I plan on doing all story missions in order before finally re doing forsaken and Shadowkeep.  


This got me thinking, however, about what missions stood out to me as my favorite in Destiny's history. And I think I know what my favorite are, and it can always be chalked up to one moment in the mission that stood out to me.

For Destiny 1... I have three. The first is 'The Last Array', that mission on Earth where you have to enable an array of... I think its satellites etc for Rasputin in the cosmodrome. I'ts pretty bog standard now, but for me, that longer ""defend the ghost"" section at the end was epic, with the array slowly rising in the background and the grandiose music as hive ships appeared and fired on me... Destiny was my very first shooter, so that moment on the PS4 was very difficult, and rewarding, for me.

Second is probably 'The Coming War'. When you land on Phobos and see the utter devastation caused by this... Unknown, ominous and mysterious threat? It was creepy. Then when you see the boss pop up, and have to escape to your ship... It was the first time in Destiny I felt like my Guardian was genuinely being pushed back, and beaten. I was afraid for his safety, which was amazing. Combined with my lack luster shooter skills (I was a taken tot, brand new to shooters), it was another mission that was genuinely challenging to me.

Third, and my final from Destiny 1, is 'Lost to Light'. You know that mission that baits you into thinking you're done when you grab the chunk of Crota's soul? Then Oryx cuts off your communications and launches Taken at you, and you need to escape the moon? That... Was so well executed, in my opinion. A lot of the reasons I like it is for the same reason as I like 'The Coming War', I feel genuinely afraid for my guardian, and how powerless he is, and throw in the contrasts to Eris' story about being trapped to the moon... Heck.

Now, for Destiny 2, my favorite mission by FAR is homecoming part 2. You know, the one where you start hobbling through the city, powerless? There is one particular moment in that mission that cements it as being epic for me. When you're walking across the snowy ridge, the ""journey"" soundtrack playing, the city in the distance, still burning days after the attack, and the traveler, broken and crippled, barely visible through the smoke? And then the choir in Journey starts, just as a cabal ship flies by... Shivers, every time. I love it, and it's probably my favorite mission in Destiny full stop because of that moment, at least, until I finish Shadowkeep.

A special shout out to all subclass related quests in Destiny as well. In D1, the TTK subclass quests were amazing, as were the Subclass quests in D2.  Lemme know your fav missions below, there are probably some amazing ones I missed. And as a side note, my fav destiny cutscene is SO the taken vs the awoken.

I've forwarded ports, hardwired and I have shut down my anti virus and to no avail the game still constantly disconnects me. I started to play at New Light and had only disconnected 2 times before this season. I disconnect almost every other game. Just now for the first time, out of every other time, I was finally able to reconnect to a booted match.

Has anyone found any other solutions? This doesnt even seem like something that has been addressed by Bungie. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!",5,1585588269,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frurro/constant_disconnects_available_solutions_not/,DestinyTheGame,1

fruqt8,ksprice12,"Hey Bungie was ""development update 1-11-18"" made by your dev team or Activision dev team?","Idk if any of you have read or remember the development update 1-11-18 but it states 

""Eververse-We recognize that the scales are tipped too far towards Tess at the moment, and Eververse was never intended to be a substitute for end game content and rewards.""

What happened to this philosophy? This game needs some more clear communication like this article written by the devs team. This post is not supposed to be a rant so do not come at me with if you don't like eververse don't buy it. I just want bungie to realize that they have and can give good communication.

frupf9,spectre15,Simple solution to solve seasonal mod problems on non seasonal armor: Add a universal seasonal mod slot on season and non seasonal armor pieces but the specific seasonal armor has an extra slot corresponding to its season.,"Every recent armor piece needs a universal seasonal mod slot that is compatible with every seasonal mod. This way you can play how you want by using any armor piece but at the same time there is the option of using a seasonal armor piece for that extra seasonal mod slot. Are you using an undying armor piece but wanna slap on your black armory mod? You can do that but can only use one of those black armory mods unless you want to switch over to a black armory armor piece and have 2 slots instead of 1. 1 slot would be the normal designated season armor slot and the other would be the universal.

This system would allow you to make whatever builds you want but at the same time encourages you to use specific seasonal armor for that extra seasonal mod slot if you so desire.",0,1585588063,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frupf9/simple_solution_to_solve_seasonal_mod_problems_on/,DestinyTheGame,1
fruokf,luljosh,Revoker’s main perk should send ammo directly to your magazine on headshots,"Have seen a lot and back and forth about whether Revoker’s main perk ‘Reversal of Fortune’ is too strong.

I think that, if we’re considering alterations to Revoker, a great alternative/replacement to this perk might be: upon headshotting an opponent, the opponent’s special ammo (that they would have otherwise have dropped to the ground) is returned directly to your magazine. 

This rewards precision-aiming without the benefit of almost ‘infinite’ ammo.

fruoes,xdirector7,This isn’t Season of the Worthy. It’s the Season if the beaver/beetle.,"I have supported this game since the beginning of D1.  I’m done.  I understand that the pandemic is part of the issue of the technical problems in the game but the beaver/beetle problem should never happened in the first place and should have been resolved quickly.  Bungie, IMO, has made it clear they are not capable of pushing out content even semi-polished.  Trials loot is a joke, as well as loot for strikes and event drops.  I mean if you think about this season the only thing they did was a redesign of the obelisk event and brought back trials.  Yet bungie couldn’t do a basic check on making sure players weren’t being kicked from missions, trials, strikes, and patrols.  I hate to even say it but it looks like bungie needed Activision a lot more than they acted.   

Bungie promised us more transparency, more communication, and the story they wanted to tell.  So far it’s been lie, lie, and very little story.  I’m tired of being lied to and buying into a game where the company literally doesn’t care if you can’t even stay in mission.  We are 20 days into this season and I can’t even bring myself to start Destiny.  I am ashamed at myself for letting myself be disappointed, again, by Bungie.  The false promises of bungie are as bad as the false promises of a politician at this point.  If I want to be lied to I’ll just go watch Fox News.

frueqb,Timsaurus,"I have way too much knowledge of this game, none of it helps in Trials.","I've already made a comment of most of this on another post, but I thought it deserved it's own post, it's likely been done to death, but some may enjoy a heavily experienced player's take on this.

_____

I play this game ***a lot***. I know more about it than will ever be strategically helpful. I can tell you the name, frame, and energy type of a Blue weapon based on it's image alone. I know the maps like the back of my hand, I know the approximate range of basically every weapon in the game, I know where snipers set up, and which corners shotgun apes find the cosiest. 

Ican tell you that all of this map awareness, along with listening to movements and watching radar, can be rendered absolutely useless when you're going up against people that have gone flawless and are using the most OP meta weapons you could possibly imagine. Max range SpareBenders combo? You bet. Revoker HardLight? Way to fucking many to count.

I can regularly stomp in QP elim, I'm well aware that trials is a completely different beast, but regardless, I'm pretty good at PvP, I've gotten to fabled every season, and the only reason I haven't hit Legend is because of the time it would take to grind up to there, and for what? A useless MIDA catalyst? A flex title? No thanks, I'll stick to being a Blacksmith.

Regardless of all this, every trials match I've played has been a loss, some have been close, but the absolute cheesiness if these sweat loadouts always let's them squeak out the win. My team isn't bad, they're not great, not even as good as I am, but they're far from bad. They have good map awareness, they know when to push and when to fall back, and can reliably kill without being killed.

I can't help but feel that even good PvP players are just fucking cannon fodder for token grinders, I'll never understand it honestly, the weapons aren't even good, and I guess the armor looks kind of cool if you want to look like you just wandered out of some dusty crypt, but I'm a Hunter and honestly and truly, I'd rather wear my zero light Scorched Hunter Gear from Ghaul's *fall* collection.

The ONLY good thing I have seen come from trials is that all the players that live in a bathtub of their own sweat are out of the fun crucible playlists for the weekend. Normal PvP is pretty fun when you are aren't greeted by a Slideshot Rangebenders around every corner, let me tell you. I've even pulled out some old favorites of mine like Null Calamity and had FUN with it. 

D2 Trials feels like playing a 1v6 against a team of Y2 Thorns in D1 with nothing but a sidearm and a broken dream. Trials isn't ""back,"" it's a soulless husk; a reanimated corpse of what it used to be.

As a final plea, token grinders, please stop resetting your ticket every fucking match, and Bungie, *stop letting them do it, only allow a reset after a loss.*  Doesn't fix the problem but it's a start.

The only season pass exotic that has a champion mod integrated into its design is eriana’s vow, and for a while it felt fresh and spiced up my loadout for a while. And then Symmetry had an unstoppable mod integrated into its alternate fire which yes, was a glitch but it made the gun feel powerful. If Tommy’s Matchbook had an overload mod on it I’d use it so much more in endgame content.

frtzy3,tanaysharma97,I would happily grind bounties if the Season Pass would give me back my Silver.,"This has been discussed before and I know I am beating a dead horse at this point. I never had an issue with spending Silver and not getting it back from the Season Pass until recent times. Because, truth be told, nothing in this game is motivating me to keep me playing.

Every other game which has a Season/Battle Pass of any sort, makes sure you get back at least half of what you paid for (R6, Apex Legends, Fortnite, list goes on). On top of the absurd Eververse cosmetic items, every season asks for a subscription fee because let's be honest, playing without the Pass is not fulfilling at all. Especially during a time when it's become a struggle to be rewarded anything within the content outside absurd bounties.

I would legit do those bounties if it meant getting my Silver back, waiting for a better Season/Update to drop so I can think of investing again. But that won't happen, and now I don't see any point in playing the game.

I understand the amount of people who are enraged about the lack of motivation they're finding regarding staying with the game but it's important that we all voice our issues. Because when Shadowkeep dropped, one of the person from the dev teams clearly stated that there are only two parties in control of the future of Destiny 2 - Bungie and the playerbase. 

Shit, I really miss the days I *wanted* to play this game.",3,1585585814,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frtzy3/i_would_happily_grind_bounties_if_the_season_pass/,DestinyTheGame,1
frts5z,Pr0m37h3um,Idea for a new Crucible mode,"Okay, so. I was playing Iron Banner with some friends the other day when I casually suggested the idea of a new Crucible mode. Essentially, my original statement was ""Hey, what if they added a Crucible mode where you could use more than one exotic?"" It may have spawned from the fact that I often find myself a bit disappointed when I find a new Exotic that gives me a new effect on my dodge - ""Oh, I can use this with my Wormhusk! That'll let me... oh, wait.""

The discussion spiraled outward from there, and I realized that maybe it wasn't such a dumb idea after all. It would be very fun and very chaotic and I think it could work. So here's my idea. 

A lot of this is very dependent on it being a sort of alternate, high-tier version of Iron Banner. I'm calling it Golden Dawn. It would come around once a month and last for one week, just like Iron Banner, with a one-week break period between Iron Banner and Golden Dawn. 

There would be a GD vendor in the Tower in the same spot that Saladin currently occupies during IB. Not sure who it would be, but that's not too important. They would grant a per-season quest, just like Saladin, which would grant one exotic engram at the end. It would likely take much longer to complete than an IB ritual weapon quest, however.

As for the mode itself, there are some changes. Most likely, it would use a modified version of Iron Banner's Control variant. Exactly how it would be modified from IB I do not know. It would probably have a Power minimum similar to Trials, and level advantages are enabled. Ideally it would utilize skill-based matchmaking.

When you enter the Crucible menu, GD would be located in the same place as IB. Upon selecting the mode and launching, you and your fireteam are prompted to select your gear. You can ONLY select Exotics (for both weapons and armor), and once you are put into a game, you cannot change your loadout. Mods put on armor WOULD still apply.

When a game is completed, you would get loot from a pool similar to that of Iron Banner, but with more common legendaries, and with Power levels slightly higher than those that you would find in IB.

In conclusion, I feel like this mode would bring some very interesting fun into Crucible that it doesn't always have otherwise. Mayhem has the chaos of constant Supers, but it would be an entirely different beast to manage the chaos of every piece on the playing field being decked out in Exotics.",12,1585585114,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frts5z/idea_for_a_new_crucible_mode/,DestinyTheGame,1

  During D1 Alpha I met my future wife, we moved together, got married, had a baby, now she's pregnant to our second kid. All these times, I used to find excuses to play every night, oftenly leaving something behind I shouldn't of.

  It's been 3 weeks that I don't have any interest in booting the game. During the first days, I used to load into the tower, and found myself standing there feeling like I'm about to go to work. Every couple days I log in just to play with my best buddy because he's nagging and I don't want to leave him alone, but I find myself feeling extremely bored at all this bounty spamming.

  I guess there's a silver lining to all this, since I'm able to play other games and/or give more time to my wife and family. But, I'm officially off the hook.

frtber,trueandfree,What were they thinking?,"I know Bungie has this weird obsession in D2 with tokens, but haven't they seen various complaints from the player base since the launch of D2 with said system?

I didn't play trials week 1 because I was too under levelled.  On week 2 somehow I managed to get to 5 wins with Lfg randoms so the tokens I earned for bounties and matches went to good use and I have a few astrals and summoners.

But then came widows Court.  The snipers paradise.  I for one have 0 thumbs and cannot snipe, do not have, revoker, and have had the worst possible time this weekend. Almost every match is a 5-0 loss, maybe 5-1, and the rare game we won.  I've been consistently playing to about a 1 KD and yet cannot get more than a win or two on every card. Every team has a snipe god or a flawless player, and I can't get past 2 wins. 

The worst part about all of this is that after more than 12 hours playing this weekend (probably more like 20), I will have absolutely nothing to show for it.  More than 100 tokens will be lost at reset because there's no way I'm playing again on that map with randoms. It's much too frustrating.

As a solo player since D1, I somehow managed to go flawless in D1 once, but I played every weekend because of the bounties giving weapons and gear and I could usually get 7 wins on the card before the losses caught up. Now, there is literally 0 incentive to play because you're punished for not getting 3 wins. 

I'm not a shit player.  I regularly finish matches with a 2, 3, 4.0 + KD or better in regular crucible and have earned luna in comp as a solo, I'm not a good player, but I'm not bad.  Why doesn't Bungie want regular players to at least play trials?  I don't expect to go flawless, but give me a reason to play because as of now, you've set it up to have stacked teams farming early wins and you wont give me loot in bounties and then you take my tokens away for it.

Honestly, what a dick move.  I'll be playing Warzone until they fix the bounties and tokens at the very least.",1,1585583645,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frtber/what_were_they_thinking/,DestinyTheGame,1

Illicit/outlawed/notorious sets would still exist, and would have that same mod slot but would get +1/+2/+3 based on the level of the armor. Another reason the mod slot could prove even more functional is since its a season of the Drifter mod slot, you can insert Forge and Opulence seasonal mods into the armor as well. Seeing as you could get hive/fallen based mods as well as gambit prime buffs with a slot like this, I could see it being one of the most coveted armor sets in the game.",2,1585583120,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frt5ms/an_idea_i_came_up_with_for_reformatting_gambit/,DestinyTheGame,1

\- Almost 400 hours in PvP.

The only reason I'm not unbroken is I don't like sweating alone, and never liked survival as a game mode. I attempted Trials every weekend (barely, I'm a busy man and have fit time for it at the end of every weekend) and here's my results:

\- Barely played first weekend. Was on a camping trip, came in at a low light monday night, and tried to play with my PvE friends. Didn't reach 3 wins before we gave up an hour or so later.

\- Second Weekend, Shotgun Farm Hell. Quarantine made it hard for me to play again. From this point on I'll be attempting to use LFG D2 reddit, where you get average teammates unless you sell your firstborn child. Did my best, reached two wins and struck out on a card.

So even a Top 5% player hasn't hit 3 wins, and doesn't want to play anymore. Maybe it's cause I'm playing on monday nights, and taking token farms to the face. I don't know. But that is my two cents.

frsm4m,Killomainiac,"I don't fully mind a Free to Play Destiny to use the eververse to make up some revenue for Bungie. But c'mon, there needs to be some balance between cosmetics that are bought and ones that are themed clearly for certain activites.","Ever since the introduction of themed specific cosmetics in the eververse, it blows my mind that these were in no way shape or form implemented into the loot rewards for certain activites. 

Taking for example with Shadowkeep's launch. We have the launch of a new raid: Garden of Salvation. A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D1. Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour, a new exotic weapon quest, some kenetic and energy weapons and god fucking forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me. A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid. However, there is no ship, no sparrow and no ghost within this raid. Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass. And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell ""Harper's Shell"" can be purchased from EVERVERSE. Why wasn't any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity.

Another one, the new dungeon with Shadowkeep: Pit of Heresy. Going down into the dark depths of the scarlet keep. Has a very fitting theme of the dark red with the hive, the loot rewards, just the Dreambreaker armourset that you got in the story and some of the missing weapons of the set. To possibly make something unique in the loot pool, why wasn't the ""Herectic Robe"" ornament for thorn (Turns it into a Scarlet Keep themed weapon) added as a loot drop chance at the end of the dungeon.

The latest slander released with this season is a trials themed ornament for Outbreak Perfected. Why is this not put as a flawless reward at the lighthouse???

Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie. If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season, don't hide it behind a eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites. It shows that we have gone and earnt them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like you've done before, certain high teir triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant. Why not have the thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless, creates a sense of..........pride and accomplishment for doing so, rather then just an emblem.

There has to be balance, you may have raked in bank with over $300 million in eververse alone, but you are quickly losing the respect of many players the more you push this angle on us. You have the capability to create some unique designs for the eververse, but if you are going to hide themed cosmetics in the shop that are clearly meant in acitivities that are lacking those rewards. Why should we even care at this point. Just do better by us and respect our time and comittment to the game and the world our gaurdians live in.

frsgix,no7hink,The Solo PvP Experience in this game is Miserable,"***DISCLAIMER*** *: This is* ***NOT*** *a rant about Trials, I fully understant that it's a pinnacle team based PvP activity that as a solo player I don't have the right to brag for access,  I'll mostly write about the state of the rest of the Crucible from a solo player PoV.*

&amp;#x200B;

Hello DTG, with all the focus on the crucible experience lately (from those great posts about skill creep to the rage post about streamers), I found it could be the right time to talk about another important subject who could get the devs attentions.

Few words about me so you'll understand my PoV (I'm french so be kind about my english please) : 34 yo gamer, full time working with familly. Decent at crucible (1.1 KD, 1.6 KDA). Not part of any clans or regular team because I don't have long periods of time to focus. I've been playing solo my whole Destiny life.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let me tell you my usual crucible experience that I'm sur a lot of you are familliar with.

After logging into the game and picked my bounties, I'm launching a SBMM playlist (let say Control). After the game start I immediately noticed 2 or 3 similar tags (sometimes along another 2) in the opposite team while none are in mine (sometimes the stack is hidden but it's almost always there).

After a few minutes I quickly realise that we are probably only two players knowing what to do. All the other are fully ignoring capping points, are getting picked solo one by one and overall are doing terrible plays. At some point one of them will get fed up of constantly dying because of his mistakes and will leave the game, he won't get replaced or so late  that It won't matter. We are now fighting 5v6 3 minutes into the game (could drop to 4v6 if another player tilt).

The score difference increase quickly between our team and the first wave of super happen and  seal the deal. The match end with something like 70/150 and I'm first or second on the scoreboard with most kills and capture while the reste of my team is around 0.5 efficiency and 1 to 0 capture.

We then proceed to the next game with the exact same situation happening again until I'm fed up, close the game and start another one who seems to respect my time.

&amp;#x200B;

So what did happen there ? Actually two things who are both related to each other :

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Matchmaking system prioritize stacks for making lobbies THEN try to pick single players to balance them.
2. The low player pool (mostly because of the lack of rewards) doesn't allow a decent team to be created against the stacks so the SBMM will take ""good"" players and put with ""bad"" ones to allow those player to have a decent chance at winning.

&amp;#x200B;

Because of how the SBMM works, good solo players will  constantly get screwed and always put against stacks because there is no alternative for a ""balanced"" game to happen (otherwise we would be back to the pub stomp of pre SK era).

Making a stack actually allow you to bypass the SBMM system and averaging you elo by beeing sur you play with competent players that know what they are doing and will not leave at the first tilt while a solo player as absolutely no controle on the kind of player he will end up with. That's a massive pre game advantage.

To Bungie defense, the SBMM matchmaking system was actually outstanding when SK launched because of the huge player base. As the weeks past and the player pool getting smaller, the system start to collapse on himself and struggle to create balanced lobbies (how many time have you been stuck at 11/12 for a while because the system was trying as hard as he could to balance your lobby).

*Side note : It's funny to notice than none of what I just descibed happen during Iron Banner. Why ? Because the playlist is actualy very rewarding (power level, drops, mods) wich artificially increase the player pool allowing for more balanced lobbies.*

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know this is a team based game, I won't deny that. I know it's my choice to not play by the rules but I can't stop to look at every other succesfull team based game who almost all have some kind of special playlist or option for solo player (heck the new CoD BR unlock the ability to play solo after two weeks, that mean there is a real need for this). Sur there is Rumble but it's kinda sad to be forced to only play one way.

Freelance comp was the best thing who happened to the comp playlist and IU'll be very curious to see the % of people playing on the regular team based comp playlist (I'm 100% sur it's incredibly small).

&amp;#x200B;

So how to fix that ? Well obviously the logical answer would be change how SBMM works but sadly I think the actual playerbase won't allow for much improvement.

The second option would be to add a freelance option to every playlists but I understand that with such a small playerbase (and it's not going to get better), Bungie would not want to split it even further.

The third option would be to add more rewards to push people to populate the playlist like Iron Banner but we all know this won't happen as apperently creating 3 guns was too much for the devs this season.

And finally my personnal choice who without fixing the problem would netherless gave us solo player a better alternative would be to create a freelance playlist... to Classic Mix.

&amp;#x200B;

Why classic Mix ? Everyone knows that's where the sweats goes to farm some noobs ? Well that's only because they are allowed to create a stack before entering the playlist. Remove that ability and you end up like Freelance comp, with everyone playing by the same rules. Sometimes the CBMM will give you gods to play along you, sometimes it will gives you crap players, sometimes a mix of both. The games will always change and so will the objective of the playlist (I miss the old quickplay who constantly shifted between different game modes).

That wouldn't split the playerbase too much and I know I would play the crap of it even if I'll get stomped from to time. On top of that it would be the easier solution to implement to the game (just take Classic Mix code but prevent stacks for entering the playlist, done).

&amp;#x200B;

It's a shame that Bungie seems to only cater for streamers and ignore casuals player, especially solo players. it's too bad for them because I'm the one with probably the most income to spend on the game but so far nothing push me to encourage the dvs in the direction they are going.

frs2nt,Shirondragon,"Let's be honest, D2 is worse in almost every aspect compared to D1, a long list of stuff missing","This is going to be a long post

The recent shitshow of a season got me thinking and I tried to compare D1 with D2 and I honestly don't see a single advantage in D2 besides some technical improvements 

I will split up the comparison in a couple topics: Story, Vanguard, Crucible, Raids, Faction, Exotics, Abilities and Supers, Misc

# Story

* Multiple difficulties in story missions
* Being able to replay any story mission whenever I want
* No cringy dialogue most of the time (Frosaken and Shadowkeep were an improvement tho)
* Way more story missions that became available through quests after completing the main story
* More connection between Story missions, Strikes and Raids

# Vanguard

* Strike exclusive loot that makes you actually want to play strikes and farm for weapons (fakebringer, grasp of malok for example)
* Strike intros 
* No cringy dialogue (again)
* Strike scoring is way superior to the whole nightfall scoring system we have now 
* WAY better modifiers in the heroic playlist
* Just having more strikes in the game and expanding the list with each expansion in a meaningful way
* Updated strikes with Taken or Siva over time with different enemies and dialogue

# Crucible

* D2 focus on roaming supers makes a crucible match a chore once people start getting their super
* D1 not being so awful with its spawn system but also related to roaming supers
* Scavenger not being a thing 
* Trials reward system that makes sense
* Iron banner reward system that makes sense
* Iron Banner not always Alphabet Clash (remember Iron Banner Mayhem Clash?)
* Desirable weapons even from normal Crucible (Eyasluna anyone?)
* New maps getting released at a steady pace

# Raids

* Having a fucking hard mode 
* Raids being more challenging in general 
* Raid loot actually desirable and has unique perks
* Armor just looks WAY better and has Ornaments  for Hard/Challenge completions
* Encounter usually being more unique and not so reliant from each other (all annual pass raids and Garden have same mechanic in each encounter)

# Factions

* Faction existing all the time
* Factions having its own loot pool and interesting weapons
* Vendor rolls being insanly good sometimes (Warpath Aksis strategy)
* Exotic class item quest

# Exotics

* Exotics actually feel like something special, you don't get showered with Exotics like in D2
* Most armor exotics have some use and are not garbage like most in D2
* Weapon exotics have perks to chose from
* Xur being something special and needs special currency to buy stuff
* Way more exotic quests that are actually some special and not just fetch quest and you randomly get the exotic at the end
* Gjallarhorn 

# Weapons, Sandbox, Abilities and Supers

* Being able to chose between more perks in your subclass and not being restricted to the clusters of perks we have in D2
* Adept weapons
* Focus on instant supers and not roaming (tho that is subjective of course)
* Primaries feel more powerful against enemies in PvE
* Better and easier to understand weapon system and option for rare primary weapons with element
* Weapons leveling up as you use them and having more perk options
* More super energy for getting kills = get your super back faster
* Gunsmith Armsday with 3 exotic quests

# Eververse

* Do I really need to say anything to that? You got most of the cosmetics in the game by playing it not by giving Bungie even more money and you also got 3 eververse bundles per week by playing the game 

# Misc

* Being able to chose between Weapon, Armor or Chroma when ranking up
* Not such a heavy focus on bounties
* Reward screen after activity
* Enemy races havin different sub-races or breeds
* Vendor rolls every week
* Shaders not being single use
* Activities not getting removed from the game after season ends
* Armor Chroma
* Vendor refreshes including armor for all factions
* SRL

# TLDR Just bring back D1

frrvlh,Itsyaboifam,What season should really have been,"I will start off by saying that a actually like conceptually the season model... mainly the aspects that limit the droughts, and that its stories are interconected... but there is a severe problem in the gameplay and content aspects of it... I recently talked to my clan while raiding on what they think Destiny season should look like.... here are some of the ideas brought up

***PVE***

**Season shouldnt be about one activity, it should be about the world***

Seasonal activities need to go... what we actually need are changes to world around us, that are in context with the seasons story.

Imo each season brought something good to the model, but that independently doesnt work... 

Undying made patroling feel like the world was being invaded, but Imo needed to be less random and happen in larger scales (happen all the time on every part of the map),

Season of dawn brought the obelisks (which added a different type of grind)

Season of worthy is trying to evolve the world by making its main activity be on patrol (sadly it is in only one part of the map, and it is a very simple activity)

Each one of these aspects have value to them, but alone they dont work... so, with this in mind, what should a season be like?

***The season starts***... lets say it is centered around the resurgence of oryx (his ressurection on the moon).

While patrolling on some planets (earth, moon, and titan, with changes to their geometry and skybox), there would constatly be rituals trying to gather dark energy (I aint no lore master, but a simple man) to bring oryx back to life and his full glory. The ritual would have lots of hive swarming you, while you are trying to destroy a couple of hive wizards, which would drop you a buff (dark overflowing), allowing you to destroy some hive crystals, the skybox has a huge hive mark in it where they syphon that energy. There wouldnt be any fail mechanics or a timer per say, but if you didnt stop the ritual you wouldnt get any loot... basically vex invasions, but would actually offer xp equivalent to 3 repeatable bounties

After clearing these rituals, you would get not only new weapons exclusive to that activity, but the seasonal currency (dark essence) to be spend on the planets vendor, (moon: the lectern, earth: deverim, titan: sloane), they would be the equivalent of obelisk and bunkers, and wouldnt offer any repeatable bounties, but only weekly and daily... 

You spend ur currency on ur respective vendor, get some awesome new seasonal mods... but now you need something else to do... You go to orbit and there would be new playlists of strikes. The first one would be ***""oryx ressurgence playlist""***  a compilation of some strikes contextualized in the new season, on titan Savathuns song would have been ressurected to help in the process of gathering dark energy, but instead of purple balls mechanic, we would have the hive ritual mechanic already mentioned. On earth we would have the lake of shadows strike, but instead of a taken only infestation it would be hive and taken, with the taken phalanx and a big ass hive knight in the end... Another one would be a Skarlet keep  re-made within the season context (we had some ideas, but tbh it isnt really hard to add new mechanics to these strikes)... the last one would be a new strike available later in the season, where we take down an weakened oryx and end his ressurgence (these strikes would drop the new seasons loot in them, different than the loot dropped on patrols)... the other ""new"" playlist would be an ordeal version of these strikes plain and simple...

When the oryx strikes drop, the patrol activity changes from syphoning dark energy, to trying to open a portal for oryx to spread his influence... Rather than killing cristals with the wizards buffs, there would be new bosses (can rotate weekly) that have mechanics that revolve around the wizard buffs (a lesser escalation protocol wave 7)

Aside from these, a new batch of exotics (armor and 2 quests), season pass included


This is just the main line of thought we would want bungie to go through, these were only examples, and were very in line with what I think bungie can produce considering the content we got these last few seasons, but TBH this way seasons feel more engaging, with familiar activities in mind, updates on patrols, vendors, loot, skybox and even strikes, instead of another menagerie wannabe being developed for the season, or a lackluster throw the ball simulator...",2,1585578862,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frrvlh/what_season_should_really_have_been/,DestinyTheGame,1

Its such a waste to build something for a playerbase that can't help but cannibalize themselves into oblivion. Some people have tried to say its bungie's fault that the streamers and sweats effectively token farmed the casuals out of the game last weekend. But just because you can do something, doesn't mean that you should. The fault for the bad state of trials falls directly on the choices made by the pvp playerbase, not bungie. And if bungie is going to commit to continuing to support and develop pvp down the road, then it truly feels like throwing good money after bad.

Then I bought forsaken and oh boy I loved it. The missions where fun and I just liked the story more, especially all the cool shit in the dreaming city. Grinding the raid for 1000 voices was amazing fun                         (never got it tho :c). Just loved it. I didn't get the new season pass because $$$ but I heard it was OK. I did get it eventually and yes OK, did have fun grinding for the two exotic handcannons tho.

Did not get shadowkeep because, again $$$ and sorta left destiny for a while because even tho I got the base game free it really drains your wallet.

Now I have come back all I hear is it has gone to shit and with Bungie paying too much attention to eververse, and even people wishing Activision was back. Something I remember a lot of people being happy it was gone.

All I really want is the fun I had in this game playing forsaken and I have heard a lot of people here saying that D1 had the 'destiny spirit' and D2 just simply is not as good. 

So I am asking you, is it worth getting D1? Or has it passed its time and only very few still play?

frr9xu,ItsContrast,Just a thought about Destiny’s “True Skill” system in competitive,"When True Skill was introduced, I was excited to hear that there would be an easier way to increase my comp rank based on how I performed previous seasons. My problem with this is how the matchmaking is based on a hidden Elo or MMR stat that is not visible to players. The comp system should be based on the player’s Glory rank, not a hidden stat. It pisses me off that I reached a level of around 4500 one season and now struggle to make it past 3000 due to constantly being match made with people of my “True Skill”. Although I completely understand the reason this system was made, it is annoying and confusing to me how working hard to get a high rank in a previous season hinders me in the next season. If I am at 2700 glory, I shouldn’t be playing against those who are 5000+ nor should I be playing those who are under 1000.

I would love to hear other’s thoughts.

frr9na,Fergielicous456,Locked Inventories for competitive crucible...?,"How much could I pay Bungie to implement locked inventories for Trials Of Osiris...? (Also before you probably rant down in the comments and say something along the lines of ""Get Good"" , please note that I have gone flawless in D1, flawless with the Nine, and went flawless last week.)

Thoughts on the feature below:
--This feature would allow players to actually strategize and make it hard to immediately go to one spot, snipe, waiting patiently for someone to peak. This would also prevent players from switching emotes to peak instead of actually peaking.

--This feature would also make the intro screen actually useful because that way you know exactly what weapons they are using, and since they aren't able to switch, it actually makes more since because why showcase the guns if they are immediately able to switch upon the match starting, or during the match? 

--This feature also goes well with them disabling the artifact power, because that itself, simply isn't enough to change the gameplay and flow of the matches as 970's can still go flawless, even if everyone else is 1005 on the opposing team.

--This would actually feel more competitive and make things much higher stakes than before, which is what COMP. SHOULD FEEL LIKE, not just everyone rocking the same meta, just because it's the meta, this would force them to use different guns, strategize, learn new technique's, and would require much more focus, and communication between teammates.",3,1585576690,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frr9na/locked_inventories_for_competitive_crucible/,DestinyTheGame,1

frr21x,TheEfface,"Solution for Trials ""IMPORTANT""","This is not relatable for many people. 

My experience in trials has been amazing, I've never been flawless, but I managed to get 6 wins with 3 losses recently so this is not coming from a guy who's going flawless 10 times every weekend. Many people atm are very critical about the system (poor loot system, the competetiveness, etc), but I personally dont mind, cause I think it's balanced enough for me. If I look on the other hand, it is mostly people that have not gone flawless and just can't manage to get wins that complain about the state of trials. 

Of course either you play it for the loot, the competetive or both. If you're playing for the loot that means you want to not only get the weapons but the gear too. Some of the loot are ranked in top tier, so they're harder to get. They usually require 5 - 7 wins or flawless. A majority of the Destiny community are not capable of going that far. But I remember in Destiny 1, the time where everyone loved trials. There was no complains about it and they had a balanced system, but the system we have now is also balanced, people are just more critical because the love game. So my point is, if Bungie were to update Trials now, I think they should add opportunities to people to get ""some"" top tier loot. That means it's 100% possible to some players to get the loot, but it may take a longer time for them. This would be completely balanced, because the ""sweats"" would put more effort with their skill, and the ""average"" would put the same effort but not reach the same lenghts, and that is what Trials of Osiris is all about.

frqxim,Host_flamingo,"Glass needles, stat re-roll, Xur's loot, season pass rewards, and material management.","Hello everybody, Bungie has recently removed a layer of RNG involved in the armor 2.0 system, which was the affinity that rolls with it. You can change the affinity for so little currency when ever you get a piece of armor unless it's already masterworked, which will costs quite a few materials. Nonetheless, you can keep on changing it whenever you want as long as you have the items required. More parts of the game now drop said materials too. This was a great improvement to lower the RNG involved. But imo, not quite enough. 

1-  A stat re-roll item, Glass needles.

The idea of an item that could re-roll your stats is not new. It isn't necessary for it to be glass needles but anything that does the job will be perfect. Glass needles seem to be a perfect fit because during D1, Xur used to sell this item. What this item did exactly is that it re-rolled perks on your exotic armor pieces. A similar function for it in D2 could re-roll that stats on any armor(of all rarities) without deducting the already rolled number. e.g., a 55 rolled armor when a re-roll item is used on it will either roll in the same value of 55 but distributes the number of each stat randomly as if you have gotten another 55 piece of armor, or it can increase the value of it while also re-distributing the stats randomly. It can also be only used a maximum of once or twice for every piece of armor. Eliminating the ability of continuing to increase the stats to extremely high numbers easily.

This will bring up the question of where will you get it from. (If such item ever exists in game). In my mind I think it would be best if Xur would sell it, and/or you get it from endgame activities. 

2- Season pass.

An item like I mentioned above could be added in the season pass in place of near worthless items, such as raid banners, legendary shards, or glimmer. These past items could be added to the free pass road. 

3-Xur's loot.

Xur turns less valuable as you play the game. For someone who has completed his mission, and have gotten each random world exotic, you only benefit from him because of his exotic engram, which acts like a re-roll itme but with a chance of getting a worse lower stat roll for a random piece of exotic armor. Now, I do not agree that Xur should sell high stat exotic armor, but I also dislike the fact that he sells low stat collection armor. I think the best choice is for his weekly package to show the legendary world engram RNG. A middle stat rolled pieces that could be high or low with randomized affinity. Not as high as an exotic engram or as low as a collection piece. Note that I would not be against it if he sold high stat rolled exotic armor.

4- Material management.

Now i'm aware that Bungie is most likely working on materials and the inventory of players. But a should Xur have his own currency? Should he be reworked with other vendors when the time comes? Should(if returned) glass needless or any re-roll item be sold only from him? What i'm trying to say is could the end game and season pass award a currency that only Xur uses for his items rather than giving it out directly? It would make Xur more valuable and it would be more exciting when he arrives. Should he have weekly bounties that also give this currency of his if added? People don't want more materials, our inventories are already filled with so much garbage. But in case that garbage is removed, maybe this will be good for Xur as a vendor. 

Moreover, hopefully charges of light and their three tiers, would be combined into one as ''charges of light''. Increasing how much you can carry to 15 or more rather than 5 respectively. Tier 1 would cost one charge. tier 2 would cost three charges, tier 3 would cost 5 charges. Lowering the number materials you carried from 3 to 1. Also, either weapon telemetries would be worth 25-50 gunsmith materials, and could be used for buying mod components and other items that can be bought by gunsmith materials, or it can be removed from the game with pure matter-glass lens. Another thing, gleaming boons(the ones that award shaders) should be more valuable or removed. Cool downs when using a consumable should be removed. Any boon should be able to be activated at any time, not during their respective activities. Some items should be able to be stored in the vault.

If you spike someone, for Well of radiance they should die.

Also an exotic for a burning Well would be nice. Goes for the titan bubble too, though that could be vampiric for the void nature of the bubble.

frqrz2,VEL0CIRAPT0R-84,Dungeon Final Boss Drop,"Hi Bungie,

If you see this can you update the Final Drop from the Pit of Heresy.

Instead of dropping a fully Masterworked armour piece, can we get it to drop a normal armour piece and all the materials required to masterwork it.

That way if that piece is good we can still have the same drop, but if it is bad or a duplicate it would allow us to keep those materials and use them towards masterworking a different piece.

Most hardcore players would have a full set and not even run this content. IMO Nothing to lose, everything to gain. It would make running this dungeon an alternate to the harder nightfalls and then this also becomes a viable option for players to far below 1030 light to complete those activities.

frqomj,JhinJael,My Opinion on Trials,"Hey whats up Destiny's Redditors,

I just want to give my opinion on the current state of trials.

For me I feel like this every weekend: Why should I even bother trying Trials?

Destiny 2's Trials is compareable to the nightfall ordeals (thats what it is supposed to be). I love the feeling of finally upgrading my armor with my hard earned materials. So, lets compare the loot of the Nighfall with Trials.

Nightfalls: NEED for high power level. This can maybe be outdone with some crazy builds like the one-shot titans from shadowkeep or the new rasputin orbs, but Artifact level matters so grinding pve is getting rewarded. I believe this is fair. You can get exos, prisims, shards and cores from this activity as for the materials. You can also get powerful and pinnecal rewards. Good Lootpool, fair to reach!

Trials: High Power=Advantage over underleveld enemies. Artifact power disenabled.--&gt; I have to play PvE or weeks of PvP to be able to reach a high enough power level. For the final chest I am awarded with ONE shard per WEEK. As far as I know I am not getting prisims so good look with upgrading your armor. The powerlevel that you get FROM Trials is enough and balanced in my opinion. Nevertheless I want the weapons. I can get three weapons guaranteed up to 7 wins. I can also farm my weapons RANDOMLY my collecting the tokens. The tokens are farmable by completing bounties or finishing matches, but they disappear after every reset. Right now if I want the shotgun I would just grind out ""noobs"" in 1-2 win Trial matches to get tokens and maybe get one shot gun by turning in tokens. Doing this I will maybe never see all weapons or the lighthouse, if I want to be as efficient as possible. Is this fun? HELL NO!! I want to choose my weapon when I finish my trial. Why should I overdo myself to get the armor or an emplem when I don't need to. I am not being well rewarded for going to the lighthouse or going flawless.

I can repeat nightfalls every day until I get bored of it and still get much better loot then from my hard grind in a weekend activity!

Matchmaking: Personally I have a problem with Destiny's matchmaking. I am really found of playing survival so I can get my unbroken this season. While doing that I can decide to play freelance or ""normal"".  I must have a pretty high mmr or something like this, when I only get matched against 4-5000 enemies, as a 2-3000. I don't know if this is the same for new players! Do I consider myself as a skilled player: yes. Do I think I will keep playing survival after having aquired unbroken: Hell No. Why should I. There are no rituals to go after and I get no extra loot from doing survival matches. Maybe I have a higher chance for exos, but I have 148/150. I only need tarrabah and assasins cowl.

What do I want to be changed?: Let me choose my loot at the end. Make it more desireable to go flawless. Make it skill based matchmaking, please. As an idea for gaining materials. Make Daily Bounties that needs you to make kills/get wins/ or complete matches. Zhose should the award materials. As for hackers I don't really know. In Europe I did not really run into many of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sorry if this is a bit ranty and excuse my typos.

I hope we will run into each other in the fields guardians waiting for the cabals to smash our faces with their ships. Have a great one!

The Season of Dawn cosmetics (I.e Armor Ornaments and Symmetry skin) look badass and I wondered if Bungie could bring them back for people to acquire. For the people who reached tier 100 last season, could they be released in different colours/glows? What about Season of Undying too?

frqdg9,StarsRaven,The 'Truth' about Gambit invasions.,"I've seen alot of complaints about truth in gambit.

This isnt inherently a Truth problem but so much an invasion system problem.



The problem is that certain weapons fill the meta for game types and if you step from the meta you better be skilled as hell.


Tracking rockets are meta in gambit, not due to power, but due to how long it takes to get to enemy locations as an invader.  By the time you can see someone often times you have wasted 5-10 seconds  just moving around. Alot of it is based on map layout as well. Also if you can see them, they can see you as well putting you at risk for a rocket or sniper to take you out before you can do anything.


As such you move into into fire and forget rockets. It keeps you out of enemy LoS while also able to deal damage. Why? It's the safest way to deal damage without getting sniped which is one of the quickest ways to remove an invader from the field.


If they want to fix that meta they can do one of 3 things.


1. Get rid of the red glow on invaders and add the glow as they get kills. It will allow invaders time to close the gap for use of other weapons or snipers.



2. Spawn invaders in cloaked with a movement speed buff for 8 seconds. They stay cloaked and sped up for 8 seconds until they shoot or until they pull out a heavy weapon. Also during those 8 seconds they do not have the overshield. Once they shoot/equip heavy buff is gone and they glow red like normal and the overshield starts to generate.(this one I personally prefer the best it makes players choose between cloak and overshield. It has a risk/reward factor. Do you pop your cloak early to start overshield generation or do you keep your cloak to close the gap) 


3. Change Invader spawn zones to be a little closer so you can actually close the gap to use other weapons without wasting the majority of your invasion time running to shotgun 1 person.


But instead they will just nerf the Truth 🙄",7,1585573294,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frqdg9/the_truth_about_gambit_invasions/,DestinyTheGame,1

frqcdr,riseinflame,A letter to Bungie,"***Disclaimer****: Let the record state that this post is in no regards a rant or a method of spreading negativity in this Reddit community.*

Dear Bungie,

Destiny 2 has had its ups and downs. With the release of the base game receiving great reviews of how Bungie delivered a great complete story, Destiny 2 gained a lot of initial traction. However, with time people saw a lack of endgame content along with missing features that were present in Destiny 1 and bailed. By that time, Curse of Osiris and Warmind were pretty much in the pipeline and there wasn't much that could be done to shift the momentum of where Destiny 2 was headed.

Along came Forsaken, a year later, that made a 360-degree turn and made us all fall back in love with the game. This was followed by 3 seasons, 2 of which in my opinion, were absolutely spot on (I don't enjoy gambit much). Alongside this came the news that Bungie had split up with Activision and that from here on, Destiny 2's future would be decided by 2 parties only - Bungie and the players who play the game. 

As an avid gamer, especially of Bungie's since the days of Halo 1, this got me excited. Under the assumption that Activision held reigns to what content Bungie had to produce and that they would finally be free to make they game they always wanted to make, the hype reached its peak. What followed was the release of ShadowKeep and its four Seasons.

ShadowKeep - lets put it this way; I loved it. The story was great, the moon was a treat to explore, Nightmare Hunts and Nightfall Ordeal kicked my ass, the dungeon was original, Xenophage quest was brilliant, Armor 2.0 made me care about my armor; what we got was a great addition to Forsaken IMO. But alongside came some harsh reality checks.

Eververse became more stocked up than any other part of the game. Bugs became a thing; which were once so hard to come across in a Bungie title. Connection issues continued to irritate players (especially in Season of the Worthy). Fans of the game were pro-active on Reddit with the feedback and in a few months post-ShadowKeep, it became apparent that Destiny 2 was no longer what the fans wanted. It was slowly becoming a 'free-to-play model' game which was designed to  incentivize  new players to invest in DLCs and then invest in micro-transactions whilst providing bare-minimum content each season - an opening cut-scene, a couple of new activities, a new power climb, and loads of new bounties to farm. 

Yes, loot-boxes were removed, but the Eververse Store continued to increase its production. Yes, there was no lack of content, as we got something new to do each week, but most of it was just 'Bounties' or re-hashed content. Yes, we still got plenty of 'High' moments like those with Saint-14, but there were a lot more of the 'low' moments as well. As things started to get worse, I really wanted to leave some feedback for the makers of this game, but I didn't, due to fear that my feedback would be shutdown or would have gotten lost among dozens of other posts.

*Everyday I would see feedback appear on this Reddit or on YouTube by content creators of what was wrong/broken in the game. I would agree on most of said things, but then I would see Bungie Apologists (not gonna name them) give either of the two arguments -* 

1. *Don't play the game if you don't like it.*
2. *$10 isn't much to ask for. Its like skipping a day to Starbucks.*

*Great arguments. But then here's my question -* 

1. *Aren't we allowed to give feedback?*
2. *If Starbucks forgot to put coffee in my 'Coffee', I would not pay. I would complain. Right now Destiny is missing the core essence of 'Destiny'.*

People are giving great feedback on Reddit. The game isn't broken to the point where 'compliance' wouldn't pass the release of the game, but it is not in a great state. The story disconnects, the lack of loot motivation, the lack of anti-cheat system, the lack of optimization, the Eververse Store and much more is becoming more and more apparent as people chime in to give their feedback, and yet all we here is silence.

I am no one to teach Bungie where to allocate their funds. I am no one to teach Bungie how to make their game. I am no one to teach Bungie where the story should go. They are a team of great developers who know their job better than anyone of us in this community. The gameplay is IMO the best any FPS can offer today, so they clearly know what they are doing. I do, however, only ask - How long do we have to wait before we get the biggest questions answered?

Reddit isn't just a place where people come to rant, but also where people come to give feedback. I'm sure Bungie wants feedback from all of us, not just streamers and content creators. But all I ask from my side and from the community's behalf, is that we get a response to the following questions - 

1. **Why is Eververse the focus of this game lately?** 
2. **Why is every story arc unresolved?**
3. **I have invested years into Destiny, will it ever pay off? (story-wise)**
4. **Why is every season's theme disconnected from its core gameplay loop? (i.e. bounty focused)**
5. **Does our feedback matter?**

Thank You,

Yours Truly

An Avid Destiny Player.

frq4sq,MaesenP15,I have to get something off my chest. It isn't bungie's fault for the state of trials. It is the people who feel too entitled for every loot in this game and that will eventually kill this amazing gamemode.,"In league of legends for example, there is a gamemode called clash. It is a tournament mode style where you need a total of 5 people to enter in. When I played that yesterday I didn't go into that with the mindset of 'if I don't get the maximum amount of loot i will quit or this game succs wahhhh'. I came with the mindset to have a good time with the friends I play with. 

And you know, I did have a good time, despite only winning 1 out of the 3 possible games. 

I literally cannot see why people are upset about this gamemode except for it's reward structure. No 3rd person peeking is not a problem, it has been a thing since trials launched, play with it. People love to be upset about way too little things to make changes that they think have a good impact on the game, except it has a negative impact for the majority of the playerbase.",9,1585572340,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frq4sq/i_have_to_get_something_off_my_chest_it_isnt/,DestinyTheGame,1

**OVER THE MOON**

This quest is automatically given to the player upon login, similar to other seasonal quests. It does not expire.

**Quest Step #1**  
It's Crimson Days, and Eris is in a somber and reflective mood (as usual). She wants to create a fitting memorial to the Moon's famously tragic lovers - Erianna-3 and Wei-Ning. Retrace their steps and learn more about their love for one another.

&gt; “*Hello, Guardian. Even though I do not partake in... this holiday, I knew someone who did. Her love for her girlfriend burned hotter than the barrel of a Golden Gun. The time… is right. Please, help me spread their story among these new Lights who do not know the tale.*”  
&gt; - Eris Morn

**ECHOES OF LOVE**

**Quest Step #2**
Together, the pair's Light burned their tale into the places they once frequented. Witness these scenes and record their story.

&gt; “*Eris wants us to research the two? That’ll be easy, Guardian. Back then, they were celebrities! Did you know their favourite drink to get together was bubble tea? There was an entire double-spread of colour photos in a gossip magazine once, and- oh. Not what you were looking for?*”  
&gt; - Ghost

Your first stop is their former apartment, in the burned-out ruins of The Tower. It’s a small indoor game space accessed from a quest flag in the Tower social space and it loads separately from the public areas.

&gt; “*Wow. Looks like the renovations still haven’t gotten this far up. It’s a shame about all the fire damage. Is that a shrine? ...Even now, some people haven’t forgotten Wei-Ning and Erianna. I know I haven’t.*”  
&gt; - Ghost

Three scenes play out amongst the wreckage of Wei-Ning and Erianna’s bombed-out apartment, etched into it for all time with the force of their Light. A quiet night in together, a fierce argument, and a regretful reconciliation. No relationship is perfect, and theirs was no exception.

No motion capture or animation is necessary for the still, holographic-style tableaus. Each one plays a short set of dialog when interacted with, and is only enabled and visible when the previous one in the sequence has finished playing.

&gt; “*I got us the good stuff, made from real corn they grow past the walls. You wanna rent Killer Kell From Kuiper again?.*”  
&gt; - Erianna  
&gt;  
&gt; “*That movie pisses me off so much. Strikers can’t fly! Just Thundercrash really stylishly, maybe. Gimme a handful of that stuff. Holy shit, not bad! What did you say it was called again?*”  
&gt; - Wei-Ning

&gt; “*I asked you nicely! I said, “Erianna, please don’t touch my tiny tree, it’s two hundred years old and very delicate”! But you went ahead and touched it anyway! And now it’s gone!*”  
&gt; - Wei-Ning  
&gt;  
&gt; “*I just wanted to help! You hadn’t been back for a week and the poor thing was turning grey! I was just going to water it a little and it fell off the ledge! You shouldn’t have perched it on a fifty-floor drop like that, you - you were asking for trouble!*”  
&gt; - Erianna

Erianna is angrily gesturing towards what is presumably the window, though that entire wall of the apartment has fallen away and there is only a drop down the side of the Tower into thin air.

&gt; “*...Okay. It was just a stupid tree. I can get another one. I can’t get another Erianna-3. I love you and you’re worth more to me than some stupid plant. I’m sorry.*”
&gt; - Wei-Ning
&gt;  
&gt; “*I’m… sorry too. I should have been more careful when reaching for it. It meant a lot to you. I should have moved it somewhere safer or something.*”
&gt; - Erianna

The second location is a half-buried Martian skyscraper amongst the sand-choked ruins of Freehold. The game space includes the top floor, a single flight of stairs, and the roof of the building. It is accessible from a quest flag on the shuttlepad behind Ana Bray on Mars.

Inside the space, the pair argue over a map of the area, fight a Fallen warband looking for scraps, and camp out together on the roof under the night sky. The player starts on the top floor, next to the first tableau.

&gt; “*No, see? That’s the big tower with the bit sticking out. And THIS one here is-*”
&gt; - Wei-Ning
&gt;  
&gt; “*No, THIS is the tower with the bit sticking out. THIS is that big walkway we climbed over this morning. We’re going along the old riverbank, I’m sure of it.*”
&gt; - Erianna

&gt; “*-at least ten more! Wei, we can’t stay here! They’re going to start dropping grenades down the stairs any moment!*”
&gt; - Erianna
&gt;  
&gt; “*Give me covering fire! If I can’t go around, I’m going THROUGH!*”
&gt; - Wei-Ning

&gt; “*Y’know. Kinda weird that these are the same stars as back home. Y’know?*”  
&gt; - Wei-Ning  
&gt;  
&gt; “*Yeah. Pass me the thermos. And get your feet off me, they’re freezing.*”  
&gt; - Erianna

The final location is on the Moon in the Lunar Battlegrounds zone, where the two Guardians’ last hours together were spent. Wei-Ning died first during the Great Disaster, and Erianna died not long after trying to seek revenge against Crota and the Hive.

&gt; “*The Vanguard RFID’s still responding. Apparently this was a foxhole Wei-Ning and Erianna used during the Great Disaster. It couldn’t have been an hour before… it all went bad. I tried to keep up on the news, but I… couldn’t watch. This could have been their last moments together. It doesn’t seem so long ago anymore. You go ahead and search. I… need a moment.*”  
&gt; - Ghost

The lunar foxhole’s light reveals a tragically tender moment between the two lovers. Recently deployed but still unworried by the apparently-weak waves of Thralls, Wei-Ning and Erianna make plans to get lunch together the next day. Erianna reminds her girlfriend to bring in the laundry once they get back to Earth. Wei-Ning cracks a dirty joke about lunar dust. They say goodbye, not knowing it’s for the last time, as a muster order comes through.

&gt; “*Laundry. Got it. Hey, babe? You know what they say about the moon’s craters, right?*”  
&gt; - Wei-Ning

A forgotten datapad sits on a chair, and the player must interact with it to leave. Ghost looks at it as they depart.

&gt; “*Huh. This has Wei-Ning’s chop scratched into the back. I’m reading the files now - crucible kill tallies, grocery lists, ammunition invoices, something about a clothesline… Hey, what’s this? There’s a receipt from Banshee-44 on here. It says... ‘hope she enjoys the gun’. She ordered something from him? A present?*”  
&gt; - Ghost

**GIFTS UNGIVEN**

**Quest Step #3a**
It appears their Crimson Days presents for each other never got the chance to be delivered. See that Wei-Ning's present for Erianna is put to good use.

&gt; “*Huh. Forgot this was even here. I trust you - make sure this gets to the right person, okay? I think it was for… for… What was I saying?*”  
&gt; - Banshee-44

Violent Ends is Wei Ning’s gift of a two-handed cannon to Erianna, a Solar shotgun designed to help Warlocks kill better and spam grenades more. It’s still a gift from a Titan however, and it does good work in close combat - especially when partnered with its’ companion sidearm.

&gt; **VIOLENT ENDS**  
&gt; Solar Energy Legendary Shotgun  
&gt; 55 RPM  
&gt;  
&gt; ""For Erianna.""  
- Inscription etched on the the loading gate  
&gt;  
&gt; **Intrinsic:** Aggressive Frame  
&gt; **Barrel:** Smoothbore  
&gt; **Magazine:** Extended Magazine *or* Armour-Piercing Rounds  
&gt; **Perk 1:** Swashbuckler *or* Demolitionist  
&gt; **Perk 2:** Hip-Fire Grip

**Quest Step #3b**
Eris will use your combat footage as part of the memorial. Go raise hell in Wei-Ning and Erianna’s names.
 
⃞ Kill 20 Hive with Violent Ends.
⃞ Kill 20 enemies with melee.
⃞ Kill 40 enemies on the Moon.

These objectives can be completed simultaneously - killing enemies on the Moon with alternating melee and blasts from Violent Ends, following in Wei-Ning’s footsteps, is a surefire way to close out this step. Once complete, returning to Eris starts the next step.

**DRAWN TO YOU**

**Quest Step #4a**
Downloading the footage from your Ghost, Eris Morn indicates she’s uncovered something you will be interested in.

“*Guardian. I was… looking at the possessions Erianna left behind. I haven’t done that since… well. I found this. It’s a locator beacon, and there was a note attached to it. I think it was meant to guide her to a private stash. A fine practice.*” 
- Eris Morn

Quest Step #4b
Eris has found a geolocation transponder in what remains of Erianna's things. Tune into the signal and see if you can find her gift for Wei-Ning.

Using a hot/cold audio cue, the locator leads to a wide fissure in the Anchor Of Light where half of a habitat has fallen down into the fiery green depths below. The signal is strong, and it’s definitely coming from down there. A quest flag at the edge of the rift transports the player to the game space for the next step.

**INTO THE BREACH**

**Quest Step #5**
A deep crevice has opened up and swallowed half of the habitat that contained the gift. Dive down, purge the swarming Hive, and reclaim it.

The cavern is a wide open space, dominated by three large, runed Hive circles arranged in a triangle around a central dais. A dark crystal spins slowly in the air above the dais, clearly inactive. Game assets from Hive missions, including the revolving crystal from the end of Broodhold, can be used here. 

The fissure in the ceiling is festooned with drooping cables and debris from the fallen habitat section above, and caught precariously on a long loop of steel wire is a large pistol - the missing present.

“*Oh, look! There it is! See if you can shoot it down.*”
- Ghost

A single shot is all that’s needed to knock it down, but the noise attracts attention - a screaming, swarming horde of Hive Thrall who are utterly consumed with the need to rip and tear. Additional Thrall spawn from openings in the walls when individuals are killed.

“*Guardian. This is a threefold sacrificial ritual. Those rune circles are designed to take turns collecting tribute for the central altar, providing the central participant with incredible amounts of power. I don’t know who set this up, but this complexity is something I would expect from Savathun’s brood. We can’t allow it to remain here undisturbed. Start the ritual, then destroy the central altar when it becomes vulnerable at full charge. Be wary - if you die here, I can’t guarantee your Light won’t be captured by the ritual as well.*” 
- Eris Morn
 
“*Three-part cycle, charge the murder-battery, don’t die. Got it.*”
- Ghost

The ritual has three phases, each of which requires the player to stand in a Hive capture circle and kill incoming Thrall on top of it. Each Thrall contributes 3% to progress. This is a Darkness Zone, and the player will have to restart the entire ritual if they die here, but the player’s new weapon will be extremely helpful for this challenge.

“*Dear Wei. This weapon is my gift to you this year. You are the brightest star in my sky, and I never want it to go out. I can’t imagine a world without you. I hope you like the gun - I spent a lot of time choosing the grip. With all the love in forever, your phoenix Erianna.*”
- Erianna

Erianna knew her girlfriend well, and Violent Delights is designed to give a Titan an upgrade for their fists. This compact weapon shreds soft targets at medium range, giving the user some space in vicious melees before they dive back in. It also pairs well with a heavier secondary weapon, for annihilating enemies that a punch won’t fell.

&gt; **VIOLENT DELIGHTS**  
&gt; Kinetic Exotic Sidearm  
&gt; 450 RPM  
&gt;  
&gt; ""*For Wei.*""  
&gt; - Inscription burned into the backplate  
&gt;  
&gt; **Intrinsic:** Kinetic Override (Move faster with this weapon equipped. Melee kills refill this weapon and reload your equipped Energy weapon from reserves.)  
&gt; **Barrel:** Hammer-Forged Rifling  
&gt; **Magazine:** Extended Magazine  
&gt; **Perk 1:** Full-Auto Trigger  
&gt; **Perk 2:** Hip-Fire Grip  
&gt; **Catalyst:** Swashbuckler

When the first circle reaches 100% and the first phase is completed, a rogue Hive Knight who has defected from Savathun’s brood appears. This is her sacred space, hoarded away from her former queen, designed to concentrate and feed her tribute in the absence of a larger supporting brood.

&gt; “*I’m picking up - seismic disturbances - something BIG is coming your-*”  
&gt; - Eris Morn
 
&gt; “*Saaaaa. Little round light has come to me in my hidden place. So convenient. I will crush your body to gore and devour your power. Your struggle changes nothing.*”  
&gt; - Akentathai, Defect Knight
 
&gt; “*By the Traveller. What has this Knight done to herself?*”  
&gt; - Ghost
 
&gt; “*She’s defaced the brood sigils on her carapace. I think this is a rogue knight. I can’t imagine what she’s been doing here to survive away from the main hive. Keep going, Guardian! Your only hope is to turn the ritual against her!*”  
&gt; - Eris Morn

Akentathai is delighted that a lone Guardian has come so willingly into her lair, and slowly stalks after them as they complete the ritual for her. In gameplay terms, she is equivalent to an Ascendant Knight, invulnerable to all damage but unwilling in her hubris to do much more than force the player to abandon the plate occasionally.

The central crystal shines brighter and turns faster after each phase is completed and it absorbs the tribute generated through large amounts of violent death. When the third phase is complete and the central crystal is rapidly spinning, lighting up the cave like a disco ball, Akentathai slam-pushes the player away and seizes it for herself with one mighty crushing fist. The power causes her to grow monstrously, sprouting more pulsating tumours and spikes across her carapace. Just as she is poised to tear the player limb from limb, an Ascendant rift opens at the top of the cave.

Three black, jagged tendrils snake out and spear Akentathai, who struggles mightily but is unable to resist as she is pulled kicking and screaming through the rift. There is nothing left but silence, knee-deep drifts of Thrall corpses, and the acrid smell of ozone.

&gt; “*I - Oh. Okay. Um. Uh?*”   
&gt; - Ghost

&gt; “*Well. I think… we have just seen the witch-queen herself come to claim her own. Akentathai became too powerful to hide from her gaze, and was forcibly returned to her mother’s embrace. Perhaps that’s enough of Hive rituals for one day, Guardian. I’ll… go finish setting up that memorial. Eris out.*”   
&gt; - Eris Morn

A memorial appears at the Moon fast-travel zone next to Eris, a permanent reminder of the two star-crossed lovers and everything the player has done to honour their memory. The Into The Breach section may be replayed at will from the Director,, similar to Whisper Of The Worm. A secret puzzle objective within the cave and ritual encounter, to obtain Violent Delights’ catalyst, is left as an exercise for the reader.

frpq77,Kolintracstar,Trials of Osiris: Flawless Matchmaking,"**TL/DR**: The goal of Flawless matchmaking is: with every group achieving flawless, it gets easier for the next group to get flawless by systematically removing the highest skilled players from the lower tiers as they achieve flawless. And loss based card resets help limit people abusing the resets to grind lower levels along with increased rewards for Prestige to incentivize people to get flawless to better grind.

Flawless Matchmaking is a separate matchmaking for people who have already gone flawless in that weeks Trials matches or are in a fireteam of at least one person who has gone flawless that week. The first part is to help limit the rampant undercutting of Trials player population by the higher tier players. This does not stop people who have gone flawless from grinding tokens as they will be able to farm with people of a similar skill level without ruining the experience for lesser skilled players. And the second part is to limit ""carries"".

PRESTIGE TRIALS OF OSIRIS: The higher tier activity which is only accessible if you or someone from you fireteam has already achieved flawless in Regular TRIALS OF OSIRIS that reset.

**Theory**

The theory is that the goal of Trials of Osiris right now, is not to be the best but rather be the first. This stems from the rush to get the flawless and then grind for the 3 or even 5 win loot. This creates a problem, that we have all seen, of undercutting. This undercutting where the best players are now playing the more average players and it is a blood bath. The general goal of Trials of Osiris is to achieve flawless or 7 wins and get the loot, and typically, the more people who can get this, the better (Trials is a Pinnacle activity so there should be some challenge, albeit 7 wins with no losses is pretty hard and shows an adaptiveness at PvP, but more people as in referring to players who have the skill to achieve this). However, with the current system, players who deserve the loot with their current skill are being denied by higher skilled players grinding lower skilled players in lower-win-cards. This results in: Trials of Osiris: King Of the Hill.

**Execution**

With Flawless Matchmaking the people who have gone flawless that week (not counting other weeks because many variables can change between weeks), would only be allowed in a ""Prestige Trials of Osiris"" where it can have the same loot and gameplay system, maybe a super high tier emblem for a flawless 7 and the special weapons with different energies and stuff from the originals  (not game breaking but, just more), but matchmaking against only people who have also gone flawless. In this Prestige version, there should be higher drops of tokens for wins and losses for people who want to grind to incentivize going for flawless, say a loss drops 3 and a win drops 5.. So the best way to grind for tokens is not to grind the lower levels which in turn is also against the less skilled players, but to get flawless so you can grind easier and faster and even if you do get blown out 5-0, you still get the same amount as if you tried hard to get a win in regular. There is also the question of if you play and get flawless but want to play with someone who hasn't yet. I would say that the person who hasn't gotten flawless would have to play in prestige, since the other way around would allow ""carries"" to profit from this and since the activity already requires a fireteam, I feel confident in this judgement call.

**Effects of Implementation**

With the implementation of this system, we would hope to see less people abusing the resetting card system, and grinding in lower tiers unintentionally against lower skilled players, a higher number of people achieving flawless, the graphical representation of flawless showing less of a plateau but rather a flattening of a curve to a more linear progression, and less people advertising and offering carries as it is not an IF you get flawless but more so WHEN. This can also allow people to skip directly to the Prestige Trials by joining someone else, however to note, this mechanic is already in the game in the form of Checkpoints in raids i.e. you can skip to a raid segment without doing all the work prior, or even with the Last Wish raid with the Wall of Wishes. 

Dear Bungie, I hope that this solution is better accepted as it allows the Trials of Osiris player base to flourish in a non toxic environment while still allowing more hardcore, higher skill level players to grind without hurting lesser skilled players from enjoying the activity. This should be imperative to getting fixed as by week 3, many groups of players are already writing off Trials because it isn't worth it.

**Final Note**

This system allows benefits for people who have higher skill to grind for tokens and loot sooner while not hurting people who are willing to put in the time and the effort to grind for it.

Edit: Due to the development of the game and limiting possible bugs, Prestige may need to be open to everyone so that people who haven't completed the regular can play with people who already have due to limitations of the game, but would still be *adamant that once you get flawless, you can't play regular anymore.*",7,1585570632,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frpq77/trials_of_osiris_flawless_matchmaking/,DestinyTheGame,1

I played D2 daily when it dropped then I put it down for a long time because I felt like their was a lack of content . I saw the activision split and all the changes and I loaded the game back up during shadowkeep as a new light player and fell in love with it again. Enough to buy all the DLC and play the campaigns and force my friends to come back and play with me.

Grinding raids and for all the guns I missed (mountaintop, NF, recluse, jotun, izanagi). New worlds, everything felt so rewarding when I first got back into it. I knew trials was coming back too so I had something to look forward too because I love pvp. I hated getting destroyed by op guns but I kept playing because I knew when I finally got my hands on the one I wanted, shit was gonna go down.

I know there are many complaints about the game and I have mine too but Don’t get me wrong i love the game. if I’m being honest it just doesn’t feel rewarding. After you get a full set of trials armor and whatever guns you want why even play trials over regular elimination or any other crucible mode?

If you want that new ornament/shader then you look up which strike/playlist you need to do and grind it out. Would make the gameplay much more rewarding.

frp2tu,Opitas_Opus,How Trials of Osiris SHOULD matchmake,"Of course matchmaking with connection based and card based matches calms the waters, Trials needs to go one step more to be the true Endgame of PvP. Each different passage should only matchmake with squads of the same passage. This would mean a few things.   
1: Nearly everyone would be matchmade together at the beginning of the weekend, with most everyone choosing the passage of mercy.   
2: Once squads get to five wins, they can get a passage of wealth. Those squads would ONLY go up against those also trying to token farm. This will make it so that squads actually attempting a flawless run will not get stomped by people who only want currency, and are trashing their win every time they get one.   
3: Those using a passage of confidence would have the hardest challenge, since they have already proven they can go flawless that week, and so has each other team they face. Of course, this may deter some from entering, but that would only make the matches more of an actual challenge. Joe and his friends should not face the top three streamers if they only chose a passage of mercy, while the other team is on their fifth passage of confidence this week.       

All of this said, any insight into how to make the system more bearable is appreciated. I have been practicing for around a month for trials, and was the first of anyone I know to hit 1000 power. All of this can't change the fact that every match I go into has people who already went flawless just wanting tokens is truly breaking any hope of making it to the lighthouse, especially if the only flawless rewards I'll get will be the 3 win reward within a week's time.",1,1585567747,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frp2tu/how_trials_of_osiris_should_matchmake/,DestinyTheGame,1

frozol,Richiieee,"The Sundial reward system of picking what you wanted as well as how many items you wanted, should definitely be implemented in Trials, as well as Raids and any other endgame activity","Adding this to Trials would cut out that bullshit RNG middleman. It could be a system where once you get a weapon or armor piece to initially drop it gets added to your characters loot pool, and after going Flawless you go to the Lighthouse and you get a screen where you can pick what weapons or armor you want, obv with random rolls.

The same with Raids. You do a raid once over to get the initial drop, then the next time you do it after the final boss is defeated you get a screen where you can pick what weapons or armor you want obv with random rolls.

Now, a sort of ""flaw"" to this that could be argued is that you can possibly get the god roll on your first drop, then you probably wouldn't play Trials ever again or do a specific Raid ever again. My counter to that would be: That's already happening now even with the RNG system, so what's the difference? Better to have a system with options than not have any options all because players might stop playing that content when they get the god rolls, when in reality that's gonna happen regardless.

Just some food for thought. The Sundial reward system was actually a really good one even if the Sundial itself was a meh activity.

frot7q,alexoleszewski,Current content model it’s clearly not working,"The current content model in destiny 2 is not sufficient enough to be sustained in the long run. It’s not a good sign when we are just getting watered down content bounty simulators of content that’s idea’s came from the last annual pass that had significantly more content. It has become abundantly clear bungie is understaffed in many departments. Look to many of the bugs plaguing the game at the moment these bugs have gotten to the level at which I never thought possible for a triple A game or at least acceptable. For example 2 new exotics being disabled and tons of beaver errors as well as seasonal content not working as intended. On top of bungie’s inability to properly address cheaters on PC. 

Now the obviously rebuttal to this from bungie is going to be “making content is hard” and “our development team got cut in half this year” and that’s fine... for now... but what is the plan and goal for this game long term? Will bungie commit to adding more people to the development team or will they just keep increasing the size and scope of eververse each season?

Same thing is happening here.

Let’s not kid ourselves here. We all know that the main reason they’re not saying anything is most likely the fact that core issues with gameplay, connection, and the seasonal model are put in the back seat just so that Bungie can work on getting enough content (if you can call eververse that) for the next season.

Fixing the major issues the game is having right now will not make them money. Scrounging up a good enough checklist to warrant a 10$ season and filling eververse will make money.

BUNGIE! WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU’RE DOING.

Not a weekly TWAB saying, “Here’s a list of known issues” or “We’ll send the feedback to the team”. NO. We criticize this game so much ‘cause we love this game and we want it to succeed!

We want to know what kind of content is getting thrown around the studio to improve gameplay loop form it’s current form. Maybe ideas on future content that maybe you can get some feedback from.

We want to know why there isn’t more play testing to catch many of these server crashes and bugs. I understand that there will always be unforeseen bugs but sheesh this season killed it.

We want to know where all our MONEY through eververse is going with possible hints to future content (if it’s not just going into your wallet). Not this “wait and see” tomfoolery. Let us know the plans for the future instead of just dropping what little you do in a trailer a week before the season to sell of fixes we’ve been asking about forever and inflate what you actually do that season.

We want to know what you’re doing about all the ToO issues (which is pretty much this whole season). Aztecross basically summed it all up here:  https://youtu.be/HcA9qtdDohQ

JUST GIVE US SOMETHING TO PUT OUR HOPES INTO!

Oh, wait...

The truth of the matter is you won’t tell us any of this because you have no plan to fix half the issues with your game anytime soon. Bungie is silent because it’s not a priority for them.

If that’s not the case, I’d much prefer Bungie to tell us what the can/can’t do and why. Maybe have some transparency on why it takes so long to fix these issues. Right now, the silence on these issues is deafening.

But this won’t make money either so I doubt Bungie is gonna change now.

CASH IS KING, and we’re the lowly commoners.

froj2l,Scantraxx042,The fact that old raids are tossed aside is insulting to the teams that made them.,"Think about it Bungie, you've made such amazing raids that are now next to useless because ""we got too powerfull too quickly.""

&amp;#x200B;

Leviathan: Wonderfull raid. We prove ourselfs worthy of attention to THE Cabal leader CALUS. Gave us arguably the best weapon of year 1 (midnight coup), arguably the best shader of D2.

Eater of Worlds: Alright raid. Good for people that wanted to raid, but didn't really wanted to put in the effort since it's quite an easy raid.

Spire of Stars: (disclaimer: never played this raid) Good raid. We helped defend CALUS (even if it's one of his robot frames) from the Red Legion infasion.

Last Wish: One of the, if not the best raid in Destiny. Beautiful environment, long, interesting mechanics, hard to do first time. Gave us the infinite taken loop in the Dreaming city which responded in the 3 weekly shattered throne run.

Scourge of the Past: Alright raid (done this one the most cause the damb anarchy wouldn't drop for me till the 74th run). Easy to understand mechanics in which we help ADA-1 defend THE black armory fault in the Last City. 

Crown of Sorrow: Alright raid. First encouter is a bit tedious, but the last encounter makes up for that. I really enjoyed this raid, even if the raid exotic is currently (still) trash tier.

Garden of Salvation: Good raid. Again beautiful environment with interesting mechanics. 2nd encounter is a bit tedious, but not as tedious as CoS first encounter, especially if you're a runner. However, we don't really have a goal in GoS... We just follow a signal to a darkness statue which feels like To Be Continued... 

&amp;#x200B;

What I suggest is the following: 

\- Make raids, with the exception of 1 (let's say leviathan), increase in power level each season to the powerfull max (which would be 1000 in Season of the Worthy). Then make all drops powerfull with the final chest a pinnacle.

\- Rotate an additional raid (so alongside GoS) to also be able to drop pinnacle rewards each week. 

&amp;#x200B;

froheg,ejectoseto,Why do I keep giving Bungie money?,"I am so sick of spending my wages on stuff from eververse. 

I have bought two armor sets , season pass items and some ornaments that all round up to about 100 euros.

I have paid 40 euro each year for the september expansion. So 80 euro.

Hey I've even bought the ghost, album, and a t-shirt and some other emblems  off the Bungie store which would cost me another 100 euro. (not sure if this count)

I am sure I've spent more money on the game but dont want to go into detail.

For someone who has spent over 300 euros on a game (I know it was my choice to buy armour and ornaments) I feel like I get ZERO in return. I cant remember the last time I actually kept grinding something because I was trying to get ""that"" exotic or a perfectly rolled gun. 

Eververse has completely ruined my experience in this game and I am so unhappy for spending so much money on this game. If I could take a refund I would do it in a hearbeat. I've always respected Bungie and always said to myself ""the game will be bad now but just wait another season and it'll be like destiny 1"", been saying this 7 seasons too long now and I am fed up.

fro5m1,ImHarvey,Fixing the 30 FPS lock bug and FOV bug at the same time," In search of trying to get rid of the annoying bug where the game enables the FPS lock even though you have it disabled, I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fi20tv/bungie_the_fov_on_pc_has_been_bugged_since/) describing how to fix the FOV bug, and a comment by u/descender2k ([comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fi20tv/bungie_the_fov_on_pc_has_been_bugged_since/fkfgb1x/)) talking about the CVARS being wrong, or missing. 

So, thanks to that comment and thread we're going to find the file `cvars.xml` located in `%AppData%\Bungie\DestinyPC\prefs`Just use the windows search function to find the file location. Add in the strings `&lt;cvar name=""fov_adjustment_offset"" value=""105"" /&gt;` and `&lt;cvar name=""framerate_cap_enabled"" value=""10000"" /&gt;` under the ""Graphics"" section of the strings. 

The ""10000"" number is so the game will read it as uncapped, if you try to set it to 0 it won't work. After those strings are added in correctly, save the file, then right click the `cvars.xml` then go to properties, and set it as read only. 

The next time you launch the game your FOV should be set to 105, and your frames will be uncapped. For those curious, if you go back and look at the file, read only will be unchecked and the framerate cap will be set to 0, but upon multiple launches my settings have stayed the same.

I played that with friends, and then quit playing the game for a very long time, mostly due to my group of friends either also quitting the game, or moving to a different platform all together. This wouldn't be the first time I jumped into Destiny and be far behind in the game. As I didn't get Destiny 2 until shortly after the release of CoO, and in Destiny 1, I was very late to the party in Taken King (I don't think I started playing again until the December after). I was just curious that in the games current state, is it worth paying for Shadowkeep and the Annual Pass and playing all over again? Have they fixed issues I had previously with the game (i.e. Hard Caps in Light Level being overly annoying, poor matchmaking in Crucible, and lack of endgame activities outside of raids and Nightfall)? Furthermore would it be more worth it to just wait until the next DLC? They're other games coming out I could play while waiting. My main concern in replaying Destiny 2 is there just not being enough to keep me invested and possibly having wasted my money.

frnzik,maxpantera,Polaris Lance catalist progression broken?,"I'm trying to do the catalist for the Polaris Lance, I've done all the kills but only 24/50 kill with the explosive round, so I decided to play only for that goal, there were only 26 kills, how long can it take? Well, when I was doing it I discovered a bunch of things:
1) the kills in the lost sectors does NOT count. In every way they don't count, or just 1 of 30 that you do
2) if you kill the enemy with the burn damage of the round, that kill won't count, same thing if you kill him with the impact damage of the explosive round
3) multikills won't count, maybe for the same reason of point 2), maybe it's a bug a part, who knows!
4) if you kill an enemy with the explosion of the round BUT it is on another enemy, the kill won't count.

I've tried to do it for, at least, 4 hours and I'm desperate, I really don't know what to do, I do like 2 or 3 kills every HOUR! EVERY HOUR!!! Someone have my same problem?

frnxce,NoamEG,is new light getting improved soon?,"I'm here since day one, ive had a warlock that i got sick of (he was also ugly so i moved everything to the vault and erased him).

ive had my hunter since season 4 i think it was, and decided to create a brand new warlock.

Needless to say (i sent the whole shipment back to Fenchurch) i was overwhelmed by the amount of quests and stuff we had to do, go here go there, meet him, meet her.

I would've been fine with it if it wasn't hitting you in the face ALL AT THE SAME TIME(!!!!).

im not gonna lie, this is really discouraging for both new and old players, nobody like getting smacked in the face by 50 quests the second you load the game, so bungie, if you could please simplify the introduction quests it could be great!

I've actually got a few ideas:

* how about we give players 2 options when they create a new character?

&amp;#x200B;

*  option 1: new player. 

1. A new player starts at level 1, light level 10.
2. He has to complete the supers by leveling up (just like it used to be) and to unlock new supers he has to find the talismans that used to unlock them during year 1.
3. He does the introduction quest from D1 and comes back to the tower to find it destroyed and does the first red war mission and has to complete the red war campaign. 
4. This is also a great way to bring back the old dark forest quests. The player also has access to Cayde in the farm until he finishes the campaign. 
5. If the player has all the expansions they can just go to mercury and start from there until they finish shadowkeep. This is also a great way to bring back the introduction to the dreaming city quest which was AMAZING.
6. If a player does not own any expansion then they have to earn EXP (just like it is now) to unlock the expansion areas (mercury -&gt; mars -&gt; the tangled shore -&gt; the dreaming city -&gt; the moon).
7. If a player does not own certain expansions, he does the campaigns for the areas he does. For the areas he doesn't he has a simple introduction quest. For example: The area's vendor gives a little speech about the area and then sends them on an errand (like exploring lost sectors, running patrols, a fetch quest, etc).
8. Seasonal activities like the forges and menagerie will have a simple explanation speech and then an introduction quest.

&amp;#x200B;

* option 2: experienced player. 

1. An experienced player just skips everything.
2. They don't have to do quests like the sleeper quest, the Polaris quest, etc.
3. They starts at light level 750.
4. They have all of the areas unlocked.
5. They have all of the supers unlocked and completed.",5,1585562105,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frnxce/is_new_light_getting_improved_soon/,DestinyTheGame,1

I wanted to talk about the sets of majestic solstice armors and the implication of them as a ornament. As it stands there is no way to require the armor, as it is a randomized drop. If you did happen to acquire and keep a 2.0 variant of the set, it unfortunately has no form of mod slot- making it effectively worse than really every other peice of armor in the loot pool right now. 
It's only form of use is looking cool and showing off to new lights- and even then you need to have a PAid ornament in top of that. 

pls make ornament 

What I propose to bungie has already been said many times before, but I say it again as a plea and an offer- an offer to show players that you do actually care for what they say and request, an opportunity to show that this game and company still has life and personality- and show that they are willing to go that small extra mile to put a smile on players faces.
I seriously do love this game and hope to see it continue, but right now it looks like we're approaching the end of the road. The lack of any substantial content- aside from eververse as everything is just fucking cruising over there- is seriously concerning.

I'm sure some will call this heresy, but I played a ton last weekend to just barely get my shotgun and miserable. If we want people who aren't going to go 7 wins or flawless to play you have to lower the bar so it's easier for them to get some loot with their win rate.  

The compromise here is that players state their goal at the start of a card and if they get lucky and hit 5-0/3-0 well sucks you get to reset your card too.

frn6dg,thebakedpotatoe,"Bungie wants Destiny to be an RPG, but there is just one big thing, one HUGE thing, that it lacks: Horizontal Progression.","Horizontal Progression is an expansion of what the base character can do apart from loot, power level, skill, titles. 

These things, while all complained about, are things destiny 2 actually has in spades. There are a ton of guns, there is a ton of armor, there are a decent number of titles, and, there is a pretty big skill gap between the worst and the best, and room for improvement. 

However, something that Destiny 2 sorely lacks, is a source of Horizontal character progression. Something that, regardless of practice, regardless of things like sunsetting coming to fruition, that we have to ourselves, as part of our characters, that grows their abilities. Forsaken and year 2 had the benefit of nine different subclasses being added to the game. An expansion on our ""tool kits"" so to speak. Even when fiddled with, each class always has 9 different options (up from six in vanilla, so that's actually a 50% in possible ways to play.)

That is what Horizontal progression is, an expansion of your tool kit, that despite everything else, grows as you play. As these seasons progress, and we lose out on using the seasonal mods (or rather, as they become more obsolete/harder to obtain) what remains is the same old guardian who hasn't ACTUALLY gotten any stronger or more versatile than they were in the previous season.

Guardians are not their weapons or armor, and there needs to be some more progression of our skill-sets, rather than new weapons and armor trying to replace the old ones each season.",101,1585557922,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frn6dg/bungie_wants_destiny_to_be_an_rpg_but_there_is/,DestinyTheGame,1

frn2e0,astrovirPS4,When I'm disappointed with a season I need to remind myself it's only a tenner.,"After one week playing Season of the Worthy I felt disappointed.

I do tend to burn through content (I'd hit rank 100 after about 10 days) but that's true each season. Last season I was a few levels short of 700 on my season pass, and enjoyed the content right up to the last week so burning through content previously hasn't created disappointment. With the amount of time the development team must have spent on Trials I had prepared myself for PvE to be lighter than in previous seasons. Despite preparing myself, I still felt disappointed.

Perhaps there will be some additional things to surprise me along the way, or perhaps not. Either way I have to remind myself it's only a tenner.

With a tenner I can buy half a pizza, and it's gone after 10 minutes. I can buy a book that I might burn through and read in a week. I can buy some beer and snacks, and I'll enjoy them for a few hours.

Very rarely do I give much thought to what I spend a tenner on, and never would I hold it to such scrutiny as I do with Destiny 2 content.

So, as disappointing as I've found Season of the Worthy, it's only a tenner. I'm pretty sure I had a tenner's worth of entertainment in the first week.",14,1585557288,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frn2e0/when_im_disappointed_with_a_season_i_need_to/,DestinyTheGame,1
frn22y,Hurun007,Warlocks feel underpowered in the crucible,"So for starters I've been playing destiny since beta of D1, I have about 6k hours total as a warlock (my main), I loved the hell out of D1s PvP it felt like every class had a fair chance in the crucible and that you weren't at a massive disadvantage just by playing any specific class. in D2 that's just not the caae, I feel as though when I play warlock I'm at an inherent disadvantage, for instance the recent buffs to bottom tree voidwalker while nice to have didn't really give it a fighting chance in the crucible as the blast radius is so small a hunter can just jump over it and with no way to track the enemy it just misses or whiffs most of the time unless the enemy is hard rushing you with their super. The top tree dawnblade buffs, while fantastic overall didn't do anything to the super itself, so you basically trade your super for a fantastic neutral game which shouldn't be a choice anyone has to make.



 Ever since opulence warlocks haven't gotten a single exotic catered towards the crucible, in fact I'd say the 3 we have gotten are almost useless in every application. The stormdancers brace is completely pointless as the extra damage it provides isn't worth an exotic slot and that super isn't for dealing massive damage anyway, the promethium spur literally puts 2 rifts on the enemy's side of the map, which doesn't do anything for the player that used it or his team mates, and the felwinters helm which is (currently) disabled due to a bug but even when it was available it was completely pointless in the crucible because if there are guardians in a tight enough group for the exotic to actually effect them then you're just gonna get destroyed by the rest of the team anyway



On top of those the exotics we've had for awhile still aren't great in the crucible aside from a select few, (transversive steps, ophidian aspect, karnstein armlets, getaway artists, and a few very niche applications) where as in D1 almost every exotic warlocks had were amazing.



I may be completely alone in this feeling and I've accepted that, but if there's anyone else out there who thinks that warlocks should be treated equally in the crucible I implore you to spread the word.",14,1585557242,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frn22y/warlocks_feel_underpowered_in_the_crucible/,DestinyTheGame,1

I have 2 triumph titles completed, Dredgen and Savior, with Unbroken being finished up very soon (only a few more points to my last Legend) and Cursebreaker (just need that Corrupted gun).  I was buying a birthday gift for my friend who played a lot of D2 with me from the Bungie store and I saw that they sold title collectible pins, but saw that literally every single one (almost every single pin in general, not just the titles) was retired. Are they ever planning on bringing them back? I would love to buy Unbroken and some future ones and I don't understand why Bungie would take these off the store, as I started playing the game after they had all been retired and I know many others are in the same boat. For example, with the massive wave of New Light players that are just now starting to hit those title milestones, Bungie is missing out on a ton of money from players who weren't around to buy them while they were in the store, and have now closed them off forever.

Please put your thoughts of this in the comments

Lumina

1. current : IDR
   1. spawns 2 remnants upon a kill
2. my idea keep that but
   1. blessing of the sky increases range handling and stability of weapons affected
   2. grants anti barrier weapon buff

black talon

1. current : reversal
   1. grants bonus damage to ""raven wings""
2. my idea keep that but
   1. grants +40 charge rate
   2. once fully charged grants 2 full power heavy attacks before needing to be recharges

huckleberry

1. current : IDR
   1. kills fill the mag completely
2. my idea, keep that but
   1. 4 rapid body shots return 2 round to the mag
   2. 4 rapid Crits return 2 to the mag and 4 to the reserves
   3. missing a shot has a 50% chance of returning to the mag

lord of wolves

1. current : tooth and claw
   1. bonus stability while release the wolves is not active
   2. bonus reload speed while release the wolves is active
2. my idea : keep the current benefits but add the following
   1. while release the wolves is NOT active, but increased range (+10 ish maybe 20)
   2. while release the wolves is active bonouse RPM (increased to 700) and full auto

sweet business

1. current ; serious business 
   1. once fully spun up receive reduced incoming flinch
2. my idea keep that but
   1. kills grant a random amount of the mag back (between 10 - 30 rounds)
   2. grants vorpal weapon and 4th time's the charm

Like holy shit can we have people at least attempting to use primaries? You look at a killfeed during a match it's 80% shotguns and snipers with a little fusion rifle sprinkled in between.

Just. Reduce. Special. Availability.

Use the D1 method of special ammo boxes, make people drop the exact ammount of special they had when they died and ignore scavenger in crucible, don't let someone with a shotgun drop sniper ammo or vice versa.

Maybe not dying in .3 seconds once encountering an enemy would at least make the flow of the game feel a bit better.",3,1585555925,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frmtrj/one_simple_suggestion_thatd_improve_pvp_a_ton/,DestinyTheGame,1

frmsha,Fusionking69,How does the matchmaking in Trials work?,"I seriously want to know. Please Bungie - give us a specific answer, not something vague like you guys usually do.

For perspective of my experience: my Trials fireteam consists of 1 good, 1 average and 1 weak player, so my fireteam could be categorized as ""average"". 

From my understanding there can be 4 options, how MM in Trials could work:

1) Purely connection-based. That´s not it. Who am I kidding.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Purely skill-based. Possible, but if it´s skill based, then my team should be matching other average teams. And boy, we are not matching average teams. At least 50% of all cards we play, we start off against teams with several flawless runs, highest we got this weekend was a team with 38 flawless runs in the first match of the card. If it is skill based, it is definitely based on the skill of the strongest player in each team, which is very stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

3) Purely card-based. Highly unlikely, because if it was the case, how can so many people report to play against very strong teams in the first few matches of a ticket. The really good teams should be between 5-7 wins, right?

&amp;#x200B;

4) A combination of the above. This is the most likely option, but also the most convoluted and the hardest to understand from our perspective. I suspect that MM tries to consider all the factors, but does it poorly, which leads to a feeling of hopelessness for weak and average teams.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone shed some light on this?

&amp;#x200B;

A closing personal note:

If we aren´t meant to go flawless, that´s OK for us (although we went flawless 15 times in D1). BUT I think we are meant to have fun in the game mode, as it is the only real ""content"" of the season, we all paid for. Spoiler alert: as we are being absolutely destroyed each weekend, we are not having fun in Trials. We never got further than 3 wins and I just don´t understand it. Yes, players probably got better since D1 and yes, maybe we don´t belong to the best anymore. But I know that we aren´t bad. Still we lose the majority of our matches and have now arrived at the point of hopelessness, just as a large part of the Destiny community.",5,1585555722,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frmsha/how_does_the_matchmaking_in_trials_work/,DestinyTheGame,1
frms7c,Enigma3541,Would trials be more engaging if it also had a 1v1 competitive matchmaking?,"Hey Guardians! I was discussing this with a few other D1 to D2 guardians and they all generally thought trials was a bit sweaty, not necessarily in a bad way like they hated the new/returning mode. 

They just thought it was a bit rough and they ultimately discussed a general frustration with finding teammates, “let alone good teammates” one of them said. (I think it was a jab at me lol 😂😭😅)

Which got me thinking... how many guardians out there would appreciate a 1v1 solo matchmaking event for the solo players out there? Still a way to play competitive but without a need to have a team. 

This concept further intrigued me when I gave thought to the main story missions. And how, through there years our guardian (whether it be true or not lol) has been a symbol of might for the tower. Even giving us nick names like slayer of oryx, the savior of the city and many others. When playing a main story mission and you have a full fire team you still are seen as an individual in the cut scenes, never showing your team members, except for raid intros.

(Side note you guys remember seeing all the guardians in the tower at the end of D1’s campaign cut scene? That was pretty cool. Ok back to my point)

Now my reasoning for a solo comp/1v1 matchmaking comes from the realization that the we as guardians have been traversing a path of solo conquest. The game literally pushes us to feel like individual elites. 
So why are there no competitive arenas that allow such combat? 

So I’m proposing the question to the community, how would you feel if there was a 1v1 subset of trials for the solo player. With new emblems and even if it was just an ornament variation of the new trials armor that proved/showed the individuals might vs the team. 

Now I’m not in anyway saying this is the right idea, or to start a I hate trials band. No, not at all, I genuinely want to know what others think about a solo matchmaking mode. Where glory is given and rewards are available to show even if by just emblems and ornaments that You as an individual, are an elite and you got there on your own. 


Please let me know your thoughts. I love to hear what other guardians are thinking.

You get a measure of your skill by how many wins are on your card.

Much like in D1:
- Okay players will consistently get 1-2 wins maybe 3.
- Solid players will consistently 3-5 maybe 7 with 2 losses.
- Great players will consistently get 5-7 maybe flawless.
- The best players will consistently get flawless. 
- people keep coming back because even going 2-3 is fun

But right now in D2:
- the best players get flawless and farm 3 wins for weapons
- everyone else gets 0-2 wins and gives up because losing 10 straight matches against flawless teams feels bad


I just want to fight Brock, maybe Misty. I want to work my way up. Don’t match me against elite 4 champion Gary when I’m just barely trying to get my 2nd or 3rd badge. Can you imagine how bad of a game Pokémon would be if you went from fighting a trainer and his lvl 3 pidgey near pallet town and the next person you have to beat is Gary and his lvl 65 blastoise?

frmbv6,made-in-hvn,Can we get the villains perspective? And characters that would likely interact with each other?,"Disclaimer: please don't come with ""oh the interactions are written in this lorebook"" / ""referenced in this exotic"". 


I mean, you guys did it with Oryx (even tho it wasn't that present) to Ghaul, Consul and with Uldren. They had their villain Screentime. Even The Fanatic had it 

Wouldn't hurt to see the Psion sister talking about throwing the Almighty at the traveler or back in a season ago where the Flayers were taking charge of the Red Legion

Like, Vex start showing up again on the moon and we have to kill the Undying Mind. Does Osiris have an opinion about this? Asher? 

The Psion Sisters were changing the timeline, Ikora couldn't help? Zavala? 

Nightmares are at the moon, the pyramids too. Does the Drifter know something? The Black Garden is using motes of dark, shouldn't we tell him that?

Hashladun just gets talked over of who she was, then she appears to be beaten. Couldn't the daughter of Crota say something?

Ada-1 can't say something about Almighty coming to Earth and lend some Black Armory tech to Ana Bray and Rasputin? Or Hawthorne since she aided us against the Red Legion on the Last City?


It's no secret that SIVA is on the Moon, will Lord Saladin have a word about it?

frlww2,Rocky813,Destiny overcorrected on striker titans,"I am glad the era of bottom tree striker 6-10 multi kills are over. But wow the bottom tree striker is so average now. Squishy, the aoe heavy attack is garbage, can be easily downed by 2 guardians in a medium space, and probably the worst dueling super. Not to mention how bad it is in pve now.

I honestly think it’s become one of the most underwhelming supers in the game for pvp and pve. I feel like the subclass is being punished for how overpowered it was. They didn’t adjust or tweak it... they just tore it down. 

- bring back health regen on hit but only up to 1/2 health back. Make the super run out much faster. (Imo I think all roaming supers especially ones with energy on kill should run out faster)
- improve aoe heavy smash so it has much wider aoe and damage and much less animation time before and after (like arc strider heavy) but it takes up 1/2 your super energy. So for example you could just perform 3 rapid aoe in succession which could be good for super battles and also pve majors. This would also let you cast your super and go straight into lunges. 

I don’t think this would make it overpowered or anything. I think roaming supers like bottom tree should last only for a few seconds but that initial aoe should be much more reliable (much like D1).",4,1585550889,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frlww2/destiny_overcorrected_on_striker_titans/,DestinyTheGame,1
frlwgv,xMagnumMGx,There is one big question that Destiny no longer answers for me.,"Why?

This is the big question that should be answered for every product release. Why? Why should I enjoy this? Why should I keep playing this? Why am I sticking with this? I am no longer finding myself answering these questions and I believe my time with this franchise is limited.

This is a long one and feel free to skip over everything and ignore my late-night rant. I am passionate about the series and while my opinions may not resonate with you, I understand, let me know if I am completely off my rocker and I will happily keep my peace.  

I have played countless hours spanning Destiny 1 through now with some destiny vacation around Curse of Osiris. Destiny is a franchise that is a story of highs and lows. When the highs are high, man is it good, but when we hit the low, boy does it suck. I feel that lately we are trending too long in the lows and I am starting to feel burnt on a franchise that can't seem to dig itself out of that pit. I am certain we can hit that high again, but when are we gonna stop getting responses of ""we hear what you are saying and passing that on to the team""? When is Bungie gonna stop making the same old mistakes?

There are many ways to bring happiness and replayability into the game that has been asked for over the years and Bungie doesn't care to listen. No one wanted the overhaul to the stat tracker and to lose the flex on certain emblems we just wanted to turn it off when we want. Yes, they are working on redacting some of the loss stats and bring them back at a later time, but really?! After players farmed so hard last season for obelisks ranks you didn't expect that push back? Are we sure Bungie is listening or just auto responding? They put that money and dev time into that but we are still stuck with a shader system that has been dog sh\*t since day one and everyone wants to be changed, but stat trackers are more important? Why?

Another issue I have with this franchise as a whole is the fact that we have so much content that gets thrown away after each major release. The new season FOMO or You had to be there is pretty apparent that the community is not enjoying it if we missed out on something we paid for. Not everyone has a chance to dump the hours into the game and some things will be missed, but for certain items to only come back when Bungie feels like it after some have paid for it is awful. Why not have a seasonal activity rotation playlist for powerful rewards? Why not give those players a chance at farming old weapons when it is on the rotation list. We can do that for Black armory forges but cant with content that is still living on my hard drive but can't access it? Why not?

Speaking rotation rewards, why not have raid rotations? Allow another raid to drop powerful rewards and enhanced chances at curated rolls? It is fine leaving the latest raid at the top but we have 7 raids total, let's use them! This would allow returning, new, and veteran players the chance at running legacy content that can have value again. Why not let us play the game you built?

It would also be great to have a raid mod slot. My vault is full of hundreds of rolled weapons, armors, and exotics for all my playable characters and most don't have any space to allow for accommodating raid gear outside of the one they run most. I'm sure others are having that same issue. It would be great if the raid gear is simply ornament based while also having a raid mod slot that works for all of them. I don't believe it would break the game and I would honestly raid a hell of a lot more for each element that I can use to set up my load-outs to help even more people try the older raids. I would also be more included to help new players. Stop gating your own game. Let us have more ornaments from legacy content. EP gear is still one of my favorite looking gear and I can't even use it your current sandbox, thus making that content worthless to me and most players. Why? Why, can't we simply include all activities in ornaments and mod slots? Let me play the game I want to play.

Time locked weapons is another hot button item that treads heavily into balanced territory. Bungie wants to time lock certain weapons to control meta more and while that has some precedence; my worry is what will happen to the content of old? Should I stop bothering to play the game now if my hard work is thrown to the side in a few months? Should I have not wasted time on a weapon now when they could lock it whenever they want? Why bother? When Moments of triumph return, should I bother with another armor set that will immediately be useless a week later? You listened to our feedback with revelry, but I feel that you won't do anything till next time it returns, then we will finally get the chance at the 2.0 ornaments and hype that up like we weren't already expecting that the first time and treating it like it is new content. Don't get me started on the solstice of heroes and the sparrow that was a copy of D1 sparrow but not even close to the looks and sound of the D1 version. Really couldn't even copy it to make it better and worth the grind?

Loot incentive needs to be there as well and older content is a great place to keep the engagement going during these boring weeks in between activities DURING THE SEASON that I paid to be entertained on. Bunkers are great and I absolutely adore the new warming cells but that is the only thing about this season that I have enjoyed thus far and we are three weeks in. I only find value playing 3 evenings at most a week and with the season content lasting a couple of hours a night is not working. The new exotics are fine when they are not locked immediately after the release, only to have the quests been boring as all hell. They all don't have to be a whisper or outbreak level but the ones with a challenging strike variant are at least better than 5 minutes of robot hunting. Don't me wrong, the dialog and lore were great but nothing about the quest was fun and exciting to feel earned and you know it. Give me something to do other than bounties!!!

Trials are another issue on its own and that has been voiced greatly in the community. My only problem was that it took so long for you to bring it back ""properly"" only to have it be a neutered version of its former self that completely missed the mark on what made it fun in D1. Great cover on the lack of development time for this season Bungie. You had most of us fooled you put in the work. It is hard to bring D1 armor back but it is hella easy to slap a new coat of paint on an old map and activity and call it new. It's all recycled and I am tired of paying twice. 

Why can't we get the things we want to play the game more. We simply want a reason to keep playing the game we love. Why does Bungie seem hell-bent on us fighting with their ideology every single season? If you are no longer in touch with your community that bad then maybe it is time to either hand it over to someone else or just take a break. Currently, it is broken and I don't think it will be better soon. It will be the same mistakes repeated indefinitely. 

Sincerily,

A concerned fan that loves the game but finding it hard to care anymore.

TLDR: Bungie is losing touch with their own franchise and is showing time and time again that they are unwilling to learn from their mistakes. It may be time to pass the baton or take a breather.

P.S. Why the hell is the Shadowkeep themed sparrow and ship not exclusive to the Pit and Nightfall? Why in the hell is that in the store when that should easily be exclusive loot through in-game achievements?? Get you head out of your ass Bungie!!! Yes, the pit has a ship but look at it.

Why this gun is a one shot to invaders in Gambit is completely beyond me. You can't dodge it, so if the player using this gun manages to fire in your general direction in whatever mode you're playing, you die. There is no counter, no beating it, the best you can hope for is a 1 for 1 trade, which is usually in the favor of the player using the Jotunn, because if they need to use the Jotunn, they're probably not a huge asset for their team.

Nerfing Jotunn directly would just ruin the gun altogether, which is obviously something that no one wants.

Private servers allow you not only to choose the game experience that fits your style and enjoyment, but also to spin up your own private server and set it up however you want.

Really dislikes all the nerf bungie has done? Simply play on private server that disregards all nerfs. 

You have your own idea of what's fun? Set up the private server yourself and invite friends to play. Or open it to strangers!

Yes currently Noone released any destiny 2 private server, as people usually Wil only do that if there are enough demands from the community (or if the dev simply a coding wizard and release it however they see fit)...

frlkxc,PM_Cute_Dogs_pls,A Sweat's Opinions on Trials,"So, Trials of Osiris, the beloved PvP game mode has returned and we are in it's third week. Bungie, so far has not changed *anything* about the game mode except for the loot system.

As a person who sweats and can regularly stomp on casuals, this system is entirely botched and threatens the longevity of the mode. (Note that I don't do token farming cause imo, it's not fun.)

Proof that I can be considered sweaty: https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/steam/4611686018484403073/overview 

This post will be a summary of what the sentiment I've been able to gather off of this subreddit and my personal opinion on what should be done moving forward.

#The Loot System

## Blame the System, Not the User

I'll cut it short: The sweats aren't to blame for what's happening right now. They're just utilizing the system that Bungie has given them to maximize their efficiency on getting the best loot: Farming casuals is it, which is making casuals upset and leave, which will in turn make the player base smaller and make the sweats mad for only going against sweaty teams, etc.

Now my first response would be to get good, and it is right answer, with enough time and dedication you too can be a god-tier sweat and beat them all. However, many people don't have that time.

So, how do we keep this constant matching of tryhards from happening? Most people here agree on one thing: Encouraging them to go further on the card so they don't reset and farm 1-3 wins. The common consensus is:

* Having more tokens be awarded on wins further down the card.

I find this to be a good solution, however people should be aware of the fact that this will **not delete sweats from ever matching with you**, but will reduce the frequency of you being stomped. Being stomped is a part of PvP games, it *cannot* be avoided. Sometimes you're unlucky, whatever.

##Taking a Page from Menagerie...

Alright, so you want that fancy new sniper rifle in the loot pool, but unfortunately it's a 7-win reward and you probably can't get it this week. You wait a week and now it's the 3-win reward. Great, after much hard work, you get it and...it's trash. You got Field Prep and Celerity. Alright, so you can just farm it with tokens. You stopped caring about winning and all you're doing is just doing bounties, great. Not a problem until you realize all you're getting is rocket launchers and fusion rifles, yuck.

Like farming for a good Mindbender's Ambition, going at something again and again without getting anything gets boring and you get tired of all the PvP where you get stomped or it gets too easy, whatever it may be.

I suggest **targeted bounties** that can give a chance for a specific weapon once per character that reward playing the game, and not farming non-sweatlords. 

What Bungie wants is for people to be *inside* the game mode and trying to win every match. So, let's have these bounties reward people for playing Trials and give extra progress for winning, *increasing the progress the further one gets on a card* (to avoid people resetting and farming low-win cards because that wouldn't be the most efficient thing). This gives players something to work for and I'm sure would help soothen the blow of not getting past 5 wins or something like that. At least you got something, rather than nothing. 

## But what about the players who've gone all the way?

Adept weapons. We need them back, there's no other way if you want to cater to everyone in some form. It could be a perk like Third-Eye on the sniper, or inherent Icarus Grip on the shotgun, or tracking module on the rocket launcher, whatever, I don't have details yet.

Long story short, this gives the sweats a way to show off that they've gone to the Lighthouse because let's face it: glows probably aren't enough.

It's gotta go. Emotes should be disabled during a round and re-enabled after the round is over. This allows for non-risk information gathering that if you told to a player of any other PvP game, they wouldn't believe you. **No other semi-competitive game allows this other than maybe Fortnite, but that's an entirely different story.**

There was a whole jump bug in CS:GO that allowed people to [jump over and see enemies without them seeing you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKpbsPDDj-k). Everyone in that community called it bullshit and streamers that have played Destiny 2 before such as Summit1g have spoken out against it. In fact, after beating Kraftyyz on game 7, he went on a rant after losing and despite his tilt, I agreed with him, though I didn't agree with him banning my teammate from his chat. Now, this also has to affect swords, because it's the exact same thing but just in the heavy slot (you could easily just switch to a regular heavy weapon on heavy round) so I would suggest not being able to pull out a sword without ammo or have it be first person.
 
The maps also aren't...good, I would say. A good amount of them force a single style of play (Widow's Court is an amazing example of this) and some of them need rework. There are a handful of maps that I would consider ""balanced"" and they're all in tournament map pools, so you can check those out and see what I mean. I'm not a game designer, but I feel it would be good if the maps weren't either snipe or shotgun most of the time.

#So in the end...

Trials is an extremely fun game mode, but with the loot system, it's driving away a lot of the players and I don't want to see it die like this. I've never done it in D1 and that first week was amazing, but alas, the honeymoon period has worn off. 

If you've read this far, thanks for listening and I hope to hear from everyone else.

frlju7,InspireDespair,The Three Things Bungie Can Do to Fix Trials,"**1. Add 2 weekly pinnacle bounties. **

Borrowing from Iron Banner, one bounty would reward a Trials weapon and the other would reward a piece of armor. These would rotate weekly. 

One bounty for 7 matches played and one for 50(?) Fireteam eliminations.

This would ideally get players into the playlist every weak as they could earn Trials rewards for simply playing enough matches. 

**2. Add compelling incentives for going flawless. **

There needs to be a reason to chase flawless. 

Adept weaponry was a compelling reason as it granted a small visual changes which showed off prowess and also had a beneficial perk that was situational to elimination. 

Emblems like the Scarab and Jackal from D1 which you got for winning on a flawless card were a great flex for flawless players to chase. 

There should also be a weekly flawless ornament that is chase-able. 

**3. Rework the token system**

* Remove token turn ins being restricted to 3 wins

* Scale token wins based on wins on your card. First win granting the lowest tokens , seventh and up giving the highest.

* Add reasonable, weekly non-repeatable bounties which give large sums of tokens

* Remove or significantly reduce the tokens from repeatable bounties

* Create a weekly loot pool which gives players a better chance at getting the gear they want

These changes would give new players the ability to earn tokens through the weekly non repeatable bounties and turn them in for loot, even if they're not winning.

They would also disincentivize strong teams from farming worse teams and constantly resetting. If they want more tokens, they can try to win more on their card.",1,1585549006,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frlju7/the_three_things_bungie_can_do_to_fix_trials/,DestinyTheGame,1

Some things I forgot to add

The Quests are all basically short story missions with their own little lore and side story. And the further you go in these quests the longer they become and the more “complex” I guess is the word for it. They wouldn’t belong, but rather memorable would be more important. I’ll post a list of stories for these quests at the end.

Second, Leveling up the Outpost works by helping the NPCs, doing their Quests, completing Bounties, and donating recourses. If you have more ways to help level up the outposts, comment on this so I can add them to the list.

Thirdly, yes every planet would have one of these outposts, each one located at the lost Sector nearest to the planetary Vendor.

Fourthly, the Rookie guardian is a fun idea I had. Basically, when you first meet them, they all have different personalities and are only there to act as guards and to learn from real guardians. However, there’s some progression for them too as the Outpost levels up.

NPC QUESTS

1st Level

* I lost Everything - Kill and Collect Patrol style mission - Help a father recover his lost family photo album by killing Fallen and collecting Journal fragments in Maverick Square.-
* Dangerous Roads - Scan and Assassinate Patrol Style Mission - Fallen in the Outskirts have picked clean a vehicle making travel to the Last City impossibility dangerous, locate the vehicle and kill the Fallen captain responsible.- 

2ed Level

* Where’s my mommy?- Kill and Assassinate Patrol Style Mission - Find a Kill a band of Fallen who recently left a son and daughter without a caretaker. They can be found in the Weep.
* Best Offensives - Collect and Scan Patrol Style Mission - Representatives of the City’s foundries have heard Cabal are developing new Anti-Aircraft defensives. Get in Firebase Hades and steal that Data.
* Put them to Rest - Scan Patrol Style Mission - A woman wants her brother’s memory laid to rest. Find a decent place to lay his memory.

3ed Level -Taken Out the Trash - Assassinate and Kill Style Patrol - Taken have begun to rally under a single force, eliminate their new Leader and his generals scattered around the EDZ.

* Psionic Pain - Scan and Collect - A Psion has been spotted in the Cultch, he seems wounded according to the reports but he seems willing to trade info for his life. 

Pinnacle Quest - Old Wounds

* A shady new settler has set food in the Outpost, he says he’s a guardian looking for the man who killed his ghost. Send a message to these guardians by killing 50 guardians in the crucible and getting 25 headshots and 15 final blows. After sending the message, you learn he knows your after him and has since fled to the EDZ. After searching his last known locations you find he has entered the Salt Mines, fearing for his life. However, the guardian who hired you only wants to talk, to know why he did it, besides he’s too weak to leave the Outpost anyway. You’re wrong, after following him into the Salt Mines, you overhear the two guardians located at the top of the Salt Mines talking. You quickly realize that the ghostly guardian is going to kill him, but before you can reach the top you find out that the Fallen Teleporter has been destroyed, keeping you from intervening. You then overhear over coms, two gunshots, after the first, the guardian goes silent, then the second blast fires right after.

After a few seconds of silence, the ghostless guardian says thank you and you’ll find your payment at the Post Master. Then the comms turn to static. You return to the postmaster to find the Patient's Pestilence in your Mail.

 Rookie guardian - As you level up the Outpost, each level of upgrading the Outpost also changes the Rookie guardian, who gets more powerful armor with each level and gets additional standing dialogue, with the first level of their dialogue being rather timid and or fearful. Or if the rookie is brash or doesn’t respect authority. However, as the Outpost increases in levels, the guardian could add additional dialogue like “I can’t believe I held off that Fallen Captain by myself” or things like that, just showing the Rookie guardians are growing and learning from your example. And of course, at 3ed Level, they’re more confident or controlled, more like a guardian we’d like to fight alongside. All this would make eventually losing the Outpost even more painful since you would lose all the NPCs you did quests for and the Rookie Guardian would be gone too, basically saying that they all were killed because you failed to protect them.",4,1585548804,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frlifi/destiny_2_outpost_concept/,DestinyTheGame,1

frlday,Sir-Shady,Where’s the Spark From the Forsaken Era,"Destiny 2 is not in a good place right now. Wether it’s the horrible servers that Bungie refuses to address, the flawed token system in Trials, or the extremely predatory Eververse practices, I feel like almost every player can say the game has its issues in one way or another. What every player can also say is we didn’t have nearly this many issues during the Forsaken era of D2. 

I’ve seen others say this, and I’ll emphasize it. While Bungie going on their own is overall a good thing, they’ve gotten extremely complacent and lazy. Activision had a fire lit under their asses to make sure they produced content and they produced it on time. While this wasn’t always a good thing, it led to some damn good expansions like Black Armory, Opulence, and Forsaken itself. Their laziness started to creep through in Shadowkeep. While I’ll give it to them, Garden is a decent raid, and the Dungeon is a ton of fun, the nostalgia of the moon wore off within the first few days, and Vex Offensive was a chore more than anything. Season of Undying would’ve been under the same scrutiny that Season of Worthy is under if it hadn’t launched beside Shadowkeep. The laziness of the reskins continued into Season of Dawn, which in my opinion is the smallest offender of the three ‘Shadowkeep Era’ seasons. Having the Saint-14 missions and Corridors of Time puzzle, both which were very entertaining to say the least. 

If this season is anything to go off of, the game will be dead in the water before fall. The new “seasonal model” of putting out the same exotic quest once every 6 weeks with a different gun at the end, a menagerie lite, and a boring season pass is not working. People wanted trials back, and some people wanted the old loot back, but with old loot they forgot the incentive to go flawless (IE adept weapons). This game has been nothing but reskin after reskin since Shadowkeep launched. Lazy quest after lazy quest. I understand that they don’t have Activision to support them anymore, but when Forsaken came out it seemed like they actually gave a damn about the game. They were passionate and excited and they brought the second best expansion to the Destiny franchise, first is, well, the Taken King obviously. 

Ever since Bungie gained its independence it seems like they’ve stopped caring. There’s no new, original locations like the Dreaming City, my personal favorite location in the whole franchise, and the Tangled Shore. Half of the exotics we get are rehashed from D1 and they’re not the exotics that anyone asked for. The quest system (I know I’ve mentioned it a lot but it annoys me to no end) is awful. Please give us some unique objectives. They don’t even need to be hard, just something other than fucking heroic public events please. 

Although it sucks to hear, I know I was upset the first time I realized this, Activision in their own twisted way gave Bungie the spirit to create for the game, not to be complacent. I’m writing this all from a place of desperation and love. This is my favorite game franchise. I’ve sunk thousands of hours into each game and I’ve played through every expansion and every era, wether it be a horrible one or a great one. I don’t want to see my favorite game die. It’s already falling and it seems like Bungie has no intention of fixing it. It just makes me sad more than anything. If you still love the game and play it every day, good for you! I’m glad there are still people that love everything there is to love about the game. I still love it too, but I can’t bring myself to play much anymore but if you still love it, more power to you. 

Since this is Reddit I know everything I said is wrong and my opinion is invalid but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there. You can rip me to shreds all you want for having a different take than you but hey, if you made it this far, congratulations.",15,1585548111,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frlday/wheres_the_spark_from_the_forsaken_era/,DestinyTheGame,1

I think it's safe to say that Guiding Light is the best perk for a ghost shell because of it's universal use and because of how important exp has become.

frl64y,UltraNoahXV,The lack of synergy options between the Artifact Mods and the Warmind mods discourages me to try different combos.,"So I wanted to to try and optimize my Warlock, seeing how endgame is mostly 3 man activities with champion modifiers. I want to run him on an Arc Based build using Geomag Stabilizers. I also want to run some Seraph gear and try to use some of the Warmind Mods. The problem I run into is using Champion Mods in tandem with the Warmind Mods. 

There are no Seraph Hand Cannons to use with Unstoppable, and the only other way to get it is with the mod from the season artifact. Overload only exists on Auto, Smgs, side arms, and Swords, while Anti Barrier exist on Side arms and SMGs. Without there being any unstoppable in the third slot for your weapons or lacking kinetic weapons for Seraph mods, the potential gets capped; I was hopling to run a sword with a Seraph Auto and Sidearm, but there are no mods with Unstoppable that support those guns and are Seraph weapons. Essentially, this puts me into an undesirable situation where I have to sacrifice the tools given to me via grinding and at the beginning of season to follow champion mechanics. This leads me with a sense of dissappointment and my desire to fullfill a power fantasy of having a Seraph theme loadout and gear that could tackle champions mechanics is crushed.

I sugest changing some mods to cover specific types of guns within a certain archetype. I would grant anti-barrier to Small Arms Guns, Unstoppable to small arm-precision based guns and sword, and overload to Scatter Precision Automatics (Smgs and Autos). In addition, I would change one of the bunker weapons to kinetic so that we can have some more diversity in Seraph Weaponry.",4,1585547072,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frl64y/the_lack_of_synergy_options_between_the_artifact/,DestinyTheGame,1

I know hard light is finally good after all these years, but I think it’s a bit too strong for its current position. I don’t suggest nerfing it really but changing it. I think they should flat out remove the infinite range aspect of it. The fact Hard Light has infinite ranges makes other autos automatically worse since they don’t have infinite range themselves. Since you’re getting rid of range, you could either make it so the catalyst adds like +10 or +15 range to the gun so it can still have good range, just not infinite.",6,1585547065,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frl63e/hard_light_in_my_opinion_is_too_powerful/,DestinyTheGame,1

frk2o1,coltlewis97,A Plea to Bungie,"The launch of Trials of Osiris has been an absolute shit show, and it has honestly opened my eyes as to how exactly Bungie are ""running the show."" The seasonal content model they are using is extremely hit or miss while all sharing one thing in common with one another, they DRY UP VERY FAST. I find myself leaving to go play other games 4-5 weeks into the season after finishing everything and becoming extremely disinterested in Destiny 2. I feel like we've been in Season of the Drifter for 12 months now. It all feels the same. The seasonal content model is the most efficient way Bungie can scrape money from its player-base, sacrificing quality of the game in the long-run for more frequent meh content updates in the short-run. 

When Trials of Osiris was announced to be returning in Destiny 2, I was hit with instant nostalgia from playing it during Destiny, however I was skeptical because I knew Trials of Osiris was going to be presented and delivered as *SEASONAL CONTENT,* whereas Trials was a staple for Destiny. Remember how we kept begging for Trials to return and Bungie continuously kept telling the community that they weren't going to ""rush the return"" of trials until it ""felt right"" to do so? It finally hit me that they weren't fixing Trials or really improving anything, they were just simply waiting until they could market the pinnacle activity as a part of a season, in a desperate attempt grab as much money from players as they can while delivering an extremely low quality product. 

This isn't Trials of Osiris, its Trials of Error Codes, Trials of Aimbots, Trials of the Hackers, and Trials of GARBAGE. I am getting hackers in my games that have previous VAC BANS on their profiles. I am getting people in my games teleporting around with GODMODE and unlimited lives. I have had at least half a dozen flawless runs ruined because of error codes and I have also had at least a dozen flawless cards ruined because of hackers and it is infuriating that you are letting these problems exist within your game with no real solutions or consequences for these players. Where is the ANTI-CHEAT software? You are not indie game developers and your player base deserves better from you. 

If you aren't going to maintain and protect the integrity of your game, sell the publishing rights of Destiny to someone that will. If need be, go ahead and run back to Activision just to take advantage of their resources that you obviously don't have.

frjz0d,jeoples,Ancient Gospel: The best 140 HC on Console?,"So as stated in the title, I am a console player, PS4 to be specific, so I do have aim assist on my side and my game speed is not as high as MnK, I know. Let me start this by saying this: I have never been a heavy hand cannon user in the crucible. Until recently at least. Prior to Season 9, I was mainly a pulse/shotgun user. My favorite load out back then was my god roll Blast Furnace and my god roll GBS. 

When Season 9 rolled around I got a Rapid Hit/Kill Clip Spare Rations with high stability (you know us console boys love us some stability) and I started using it in the Crucible. It felt good, really good. It was the first hand cannon I fell in love with. Fast forward to last week. I ran my 11th GoS last week, and finally got a god roll Ancient Gospel. Now I’ve played with 140’s before. I have a god roll Austringer and the curated Kindled Orchid. There was just something about this Ancient Gospel that made me want to take it into the crucible. 

Exactly 6 days later, I am sitting at 287 crucible kills with this weapon. 

Now let me tell you my roll, and then why I think everyone should have their own, especially on console. My roll is:
-Polygonal Rifling
-Steady Rounds
-Outlaw
-Swashbuckler
-Handling MW

Now, you may be like “Wait nothing about that roll is special, outlaw is a meh perk and you don’t have hammer forged or corkscrew, or high cal or ricochet rounds?” You would be right, nothing is overly special about this roll. Geez does it feel good though. It has a whopping 85 stability and still hits 50 in the range department. With the handling MW, it practically has a baby quickdraw and good movement speed. The reload speed is crazy with outlaw, and allows you to hold onto your stacks of swashbuckler longer which is valuable in the crucible. Last but not least, it has an AA value of 74. 74 Aim Assist! It has a great look, great sound, quality, non-obstructive sight, and an overall great feel.

Listen, if you play on PS4, drop your PSN down below and I’ll add you and personally take you through GoS so you can get your hands on one. I’ve had a few and they all have felt good, but this one is *mwah* magnificent. You NEED to get this gun. Just last night I went into Iron Banner with this gun and the Bastion and dropped 51, and got my first EVER WROM on Anomaly. 

Fr tho, drop your PSN and I’ll take you through the raid, want to run it for a god roll Sacred Provenance lol. Anyway, what’s your favorite 140? What have you found the most success with?

frjob5,TheCraneBane,I miss Activision.,"I know I’m not the only one. I know I’m not the first person to think this. It makes me depressed as fuck to think that this is the state of one of my favorite games of all time. But it had to be said again. I miss Activision. 

Ever since Bungie had their split with Activision everything has gone down hill. Loot is trash, bounties are our new “content”, and any incentive to play the game has been thrown out the window. When we had Activision and their smaller “son/daughter” studios working under them we had amazing content. Forsaken, Season of the Forge, and Season of Opulence were some of the best moments I have ever spent in Destiny. Everything felt like it had meaning and purpose, but not now. 

Bungie, whether we like it or not, does not have this communities best interests in mind. “Oh, you want meaningful and enjoyable content? Here, you can do bounties for 3 months.” “We heard you’re weapons are killing things too effectively so we’re making them obsolete in the next season.” “We heard y’all were bored so we restocked Eververse! Go say “hi” to Tess!” Bungie doesn’t give a flying fuck about what you want. All those weapons you grinded hours for, now resting in your vault waiting for their time to shine? Yeah, those won’t matter in the coming months. All that work you put into making your build? Yeah, say goodbye to any meaningful activities to use it in. They. Don’t. Give. A. Single. Fuck. 

I went on a rant right here but I don’t care anymore. That’s the level I’m at right now. Bungie single handily raised a son with Activision, made it into a handsome young man of such virtue and courage, and then divorced their significant other, and cut the hands off of the child they once loved. Bungie has RUINED this game for me. NOTHING MATTERS IN IT ANYMORE.

We had a functioning and enjoyable faction system. 

We had weaponsmith system that let people grind for weapon rolls and engage in weekly updates to guns and able to find perfect rolls. 

Vendors actually had weapons for sale that would rotate weekly so people would have a reason to check out new guns every week, not some lottery system

Bounties were meaningful and in limited supply, and we didn’t have a billion bounties to grind, we could do our bounties and move on to what we want to do. 

And lastly, trials encouraged all players to play it, could get drops after matches and bounties that dropped trials gear, tokens that also had a chance to drop gear.

frjiha,iamjeli,How to fully utilise a Hunters abilities?,"So I’ve got D2 downloaded on my pc and I will be playing in the morning. I’ve not played properly since around August of last year, back when I was a Titan. 

However, I’ve decided to come back as the same Hunter I had I’m D2, for nostalgia reasons AMD also because it’ll be a nice change of pace. I intend to play Nightstalker with the smoke bombs (I believe it’s top tree) and spike grenades. This is mainly because I’ve been watching a lot of GernaderJake again and he’s running this setup. I get that I will never be as good as a top 10% player but this setup looks fun as hell. 

The issue at hand is that while I know how to fully use a Titans kit and a Warlocks kit, I’ve not really used a Hunter since D1 so I’ve kinda forgotten how to use them efficiently. I also don’t fully understand the whole invisibility thing going on, do I simply go invisible by dodging and throwing a smoke bomb on myself?

Revoker is literally aimbotz the fun due to its flinch bug + it’s free ammo on a miss and Hardlight rewards poor play by having zero damage fall off no matter the range. Even on a map like widows court, Hardlight is in nearly every game. 


Hardlight needs to have its base flinch OR its infinite damage range adjusted. There is currently no con to using the weapon. Revoker needs to bullet magnetism fixed so flinch doesn’t flinch TO the head any longer and maybe it starts with only 1 bullet as opposed to 2 to also give it a downside, because just like Hardlight, there isn’t one.

frjc2e,TJ_Dot,"Trials, for the good it might have done House of Wolves, might have had a worse consequence.","OK, so I'm only putting this after being motivated to make my own post about my thoughts, Idk how to really format this other than put the comment chain that led to me going onto a whole thing for an hour. This was on u/rezmeihaveghorn 's post about [Trials not dying](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frapcd/please_dont_let_trials_die_again/) to which I said :

&gt;Its win dependent PvP at its worst, I'm pretty sure it's going to cannibalize itself no matter what.  
&gt;  
&gt;Destiny just isn't meant for this.

Then I was told this (I won't expose)

&gt; It was perfect in D1. It was the only thing holding the game together at many points. Destiny absolutely IS meant for this. The weak link here is bungie. They just keep fucking things up that were already done perfectly in the past. THEY are the problem here, it’s not the community it’s not the game mode it’s not the sandbox, bungie is the one that is making terrible terrible decisions that encourage toxicity for absolutely no reason. 

Then I replied, and this is basically my whole thing (might be heated, idk)

&gt;Trials brew toxicity from the beginning. It didn't so much hold the game together as it just gave PvP something that people will unhealthily obsess over by its very design. It's not a simple competitive rank ladder, this is people fighting at 110% with absolute savagery so that they can show off all the cool/best stuff. The loot incentive was high, which led to desperation to win, which leads to using the best you can imagine beating everyone the easiest. Coupled with YouTubers freaking telling everybody what to use and you have a recipe for meta disaster.  
&gt;  
&gt;7 months of Thorn, Sniper shotguns, using them to exploit Blink (so much that it'll be permanently freaking neutered and restricted to one class), Efrideet's oneshot, and so on and so forth.You can't make Trials coexist in this game without sabotaging everything else in favor of it. It happens all the time. D1 Special ammo got completely freaking ruined because of Trials, pushing everyone to the ammo generators, which then got neutered as a result. Icebreaker right now has 0 practical use in D1. I don't even know what happened to Invective other than it basically being canned as Ikora's shotgun (Yet Cayde still had Ace).  
&gt;  
&gt;Yeah Bungie made all those changes, but the players influenced it heavily since Bungie pretty much goes off only usage stats and does a pretty terrible job at responding to those stats without some sort of catastrophe happening. Either way, they're only responding to the players' actions, shafting things to force diversity when people are mindlessly chasing the best without any regard. All they care about is winning, efficient loot at the expense of whatever is in their way, and with Trials, everyone is in each other's way, and that turned it toxic. (and that usually leaks out).  
&gt;  
&gt;Loot design doesn't change this now. It creates the mentality regardless because the damage has already been done. People wanted some insane Astral Horizon so freaking bad that they gatekept the entire gamemode from anyone that wasn't a crack sniffer. Yea, it's Bungie's fault the system was even this way, but everyone who farmed 3 wins made a conscious decision, at the expense of others, to chase the best stuff. Best by something probably not very significant because it's an aggressive kinetic shotgun already and will murder people anyway, but that possible extra half a meter matters so badly that people will cannibalize the entire system to get what they want.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's this crap that makes the Guardian/Hive Comparison so freaking real. Everybody like this has a Wormgod inside them. Demanding more and more until they falter and are consumed. The obsession is bad, and is costing us, because now the people who just want to get something from it barely have anything to get (thanks to Bungie) and are seeing less reason to even bother trying just at all (thanks to the corrupted Guardians). There's a lore tab the Scholar where a Warlock literally torture's somebody in the middle of a Trials match with Dark Void energy, it's described as hungry. She justifies herself with ""Strength through Death"". That's basically the Sword Logic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bungie made the mistake of enabling this toxic bound mode, but that doesn't mean everyone just gets a pass. The whole Astral event is going to permanently harm this Trials. Why would people ever want to come back when all they know it to be is a hopeless, ego swelled, dick measurement contest?  
&gt;  
&gt;This is Destiny when turning people against each other becomes the focus, when you depend on toxic PvP to save the game. It succeeding is a double-edged sword. Crucible went from that not so insane place with some things that were a little much to everything being all about optimal TTK, neeeeeding the best of the best at all freaking times, and wanting to win so badly that the game suffers socially, brews hate, incentivizes cheating (The black market for this game is just absolutely disgusting, Trials ultimately birthed this), and getting things neutered (Watch Hardlight get completely freaking annihilated after being a joke for 5 years).  
&gt;  
&gt;But I guess preventing content drought is worth it in the end, huh, even if obsession of avoiding that costs us any and all quality.

So yea, I'm making this its own thing, thank you u/ZachPlum for the suggestion. Mods, I'm sorry if something about this is bad.

Now I guess I'm seeing if I can spark critical thought about what has become of Destiny due to Trials' conception. I feel like it has had a larger effect than most would think, yea, it helped the drought towards TTK, but at what cost really?

I think a good thought experiment would be trying to picture today with no obscenely competitive Destiny. It's hard to imagine I feel like, there's so much time to consider. 

Like how serious would the meta be? Would it be dominating the game as much as it does now? Would balance not be as crazy of a subject as it is? 

Would PvE be different? Yeah, Ghorn was basically the way to go, but back then, it had no competition. So how does the concept of metas there evolve? 

Would there be a black market for recoveries with prices that make you vomit? Would there even be a cheater problem? (Not like they have an incentive).

This all probably sounds crazy and I'm sorry for that, but the current times just feel like the culmination of all that has happened before, due to the playerbase AND Bungie's evolution over time. 

So in a nutshell I guess, I think Trials scarred Destiny, and it returning is tearing it open.",1,1585538568,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frjc2e/trials_for_the_good_it_might_have_done_house_of/,DestinyTheGame,1

frjald,Cruggles30,Saying this as a PVP fan: things would probably be better if we treated it like an extra game mode and not the main part of the game.,"Honestly, I'm not saying I'm definitely right on the fact that PVP needs to not be a focus. It's more of an idea of mine based on the fact that PVP is more of an extra thing. And yes, fellow PVPers, it is an extra thing and not a main part of the game. I mean, in a game that's about guardians fighting against various alien races and protecting humanity, why does PVP need to be a thing? And before you say ""training exercise,"" games that throw that excuse in there for anything are usually using it as an extra activity. And just in case you're about to say ""but it kept the game alive in Destiny 1,"" 1. Zombies kept Call of Duty alive, but that doesn't make it the main game, and 2. It only kept the game alive because Bungie didn't do enough for PVE. Playing PVP more than PVE doesn't make it the main focus, from an objective standpoint. The only part of PVP that I will say is a main activity at all is Trials, but that's only because Bungie has added a story factor into it and treats it like a main portion of the game. Speaking of Trials, I should get back to the main point I am actually trying to make instead of trying to justify the truth.

So, about Trials, it's been getting a lot of negative feedback lately. Meanwhile, PVE is in a worse state, where we're dealing with new content that's not up to par at all and/or not even permanent, which makes a lot of players not even want to play. Last year, however, despite the negative feedback and everyone wanting Trials back, the game was doing better as a whole, because Bungie was focused on PVE, while also doing small things for PVP. They should try achieving that proper balance between focus on PVE and PVP, where they focus primarily on PVE and try to make sure some resources go towards PVP.",24,1585538405,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frjald/saying_this_as_a_pvp_fan_things_would_probably_be/,DestinyTheGame,1

A good example of being vocal with your community is Rainbow Six and Ubisoft, the operator Clash was visibly broken and overpowered and they took her out within days.

fritjk,the-meerkat-king,"If no changes are going to be made, and with real proof that those changes are actually going to happen, I don't think I'm going to spend my money on the September expansion.","No, I don't think that one person not buying it will shake Bungie at their very foundation. No, I don't think one person abstaining from it will change the course of action.

But, if I won't, then I'm willing to bet that money I'd be saving that many others won't. 

I've been a humongous Destiny fanatic since Taken King. (Passive before, but TK really drew me in.)

 I consume the lore of this game vehemently, I can say with no exaggeration that the lore of Destiny is one of the most well written piece of fiction I've read. It's stellar.

I love this franchise. I've been pre-ordering everything since TK. I have been a part of the community through thick and thin. Easily one of my most favorite games of all time. 

When I started playing early on, I was going through some tough times, and continued to for a long while. But I could always go on Destiny to feel at least a bit better about life and do something else. The game lasted through that time and I gained friends because of it and I truly got to experience the fun of multiplayer with others which I hadn't before then.

Warmind: All of my friends from D1 get sick of it and leave. The only game we ever really played together was Destiny. We inevitably split ways for good and I remained the last man standing. Fortunately I've got a group again, but the point is that I wanted this game to get good and I wanted to stick around because of how much I enjoy this game.

What I'm trying to say here is that this game means a lot to me. I have a lot of experiences associated with this game that mean a lot to me.

But at this point, I don't feel like I'm playing Destiny anymore, at least not the Destiny that was. 

The game has become a chore to play. I don't think about playing and say, ""There are things I can do in Destiny! I want to get on and play!"" Now it goes something like: ""I've got things that I need to do on Destiny. Or I could just play something else, but that would just be a waste of the money I spent on this DLC.""

I don't have fun, I just do chores.

I want this game to be good, I want this game to succeed, but after Shadowkeep, Undying, Dawn, and now Worthy I'm not sure I can keep supporting this ""game"". I feel like my nostalgia is being preyed on when they do stuff like reintroduce old exotics and game modes and promote that as a huge selling point. The amount of effort put into this season is laughable.

Money has been a subject that Bungie rely heavily on when explaining the lack of things, but sales don't reflect that. Where is all of the money going anyway? All the Eververse profits you are clearly getting as all you ever seem to spend time on is Eververse. 

The obviously stingy plot of Eververse is so wholly imbedded into what has become a mobile game with extra features that I feel cynical enough to bet on a Season of Fenchurch coming soon. Not only did you expand what each season gets for Eververse, you also took away getting new engrams, meaning the only way to get the items is either Silver Dust or Silver. Then, you made items dropped in the engram stop giving Bright Dust when dismantled. Then, you took away getting an engrams every level. Now all you can do is get measly scraps of Bright Dust from one of the most frustrating systems in the game, repeatable bounties. Frustrating because it is such a potentially good system, but is scorned by absurd prices, absurd requirements, and absurd rewards in relation to the said price. 

Now another thing. When I am playing Destiny these days, I am not ""playing my way"". My biggest irk is Champions. Champions were a good concept, but in practice have been done poorly as the mods needed to counteract these Champions are exclusive to a spare few weapons each season. And if I'm not using these mods and aren't in the presence of other Guardians, I barely stand a chance against them. I am not playing my way when I have to use a particular weapon to be able to rid of an enemy in an activity. I'm not playing my way when the bounties I'm forced to complete to progress are telling me to get x number or kills with x gun. It's not fun. The over reliance on bounties shouldn't even be a thing, much less have consideration. But you are aware of it and very much so. You even put it in your tips during the loading screens that bounties are the best source of xp.

I want to like this game, I want to be excited to play, but for a supposedly evolving game, I feel like all it's been doing is regressing.

tl;dr - I love this game and it means a lot to me, but am I even playing the same game that I got attached to anymore?",1212,1585536395,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fritjk/if_no_changes_are_going_to_be_made_and_with_real/,DestinyTheGame,1
frisb3,harbind2,"Trials of Osiris, and How to Fix it","
I made a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fnlnis/focused_feedback_trials_of_osiris/flaxedh/) about this. Like that post, this'll be long and will have a tl;dr at the end.

The goal here is to identify what pushes out players, stem skill creep, and entice new players into the gamemode. 

#Skill Creep

Over the last few weeks, Trials has become noticeably harder as a result of skill creep. It's still possible for above average players to reach Flawless, but it is not difficult to predict that this will soon not be the case. 

Players bleed out of the system. This isn't exclusive to Trials or any other game mode. There will always be a degree of attrition that occurs just by people trying it and deciding it's not for them. The goal is to invite as many people in as possible, and make a convincing argument that this is worth their time. 

But Trials is experiencing what I would call a hemorrhage of players leaving, a veritable arterial explosion of angry people. I've seen a lot of complaints, and I agree with them.

 * Players are not having fun or learning.
 * Incredibly skilled players spend much longer in the population, and are likely to run multiple cards.
 * Farming the mode is the best way to get tokens, but also a byproduct of how difficult it is to get flawless.
 * The rewards are not good unless you specifically exploit the system and control what drops you receive.
 * Casual players are a necessity to the gamemode, and serve as a topsoil in this dustbowl.
 * Said dustbowl is only going to get worse.
 * The mode was made for streamers/recoveries (Twitch quest rewards, carries, etc.) which do not help the population, and instead detract from it.

I'm going to try to tackle these in the hopefully easiest possible way to implement, and try to reuse the mechanics of other seasons when any are mentioned.

It's obvious changes, whatever they are, need to happen as soon as possible. 

There was another excellent post by /u/ascendantnomad , but I disagree with the conclusion of the post. Increased tokens on wins only still punish the lower levels, and suggestions from streamers should be taken with grains of salt. 

I propose treating Passages as Raids.

You can do each Passage for the rewards once. These rewards are heavily increased, but once you go Flawless with each passage, you are no longer capable of playing Trials for the weekend. You've won this game of virtual capitalism, and should move on. (Recovs should be pursued and taken down.) The alternative to this is that those that go Flawless have SBMM applied, or they are placed into queues exclusively with other Flawless players.

This one-time Passage allows for extremely skilled players to go through their 33 matches be rewarded, and exit the pool. This hurts streamers, but they'll be rewarded heavily for going flawless 5 times a week anyway. 

Each Passage would be changed under this system. Bounties should be relegated to side objectives, not farm ones. Each passage would chain into the next, particularly for casual players, encouraging them to continue to play the game, and earn their weekly rewards before cashing out, even if they can't go Flawless. 

The Lighthouse should never be too far beyond the horizon that casuals can only see it through the shoulders of giants.


#Passage of Mercy

**Objective:** Casuals should feel the incentive to continue rather than give up. They should continue playing to unlock the other passages, and if they reach wins with losses under their belt, they want to queue up again rather than reset and retry.

The Passage of Mercy is changed so that it has 3 Mercy losses. Once you lose each of those, your passage is broken.

Each win grants 10 tokens, and each Mercy grants 5. A Flawless gives 35, with any tokens remaining from the Mercies.

**Total:**

120 Tokens, 3/5/7/Flawless rewards, 1 Ascendant Shard

6 packages from Saint-14, 4 from Weekly, 1 Ascendant Shard

Passage of Mercy should be ""Baby's First Flawless"" even moreso than it already is. You should feel heavily incentivized to give it a few shots, even if you lose once or twice halfway through the card. People who can only achieve 1-3 wins before dropping out get anywhere from 20-45 tokens. 

---

#Passage of Ferocity

**Objective:** A Win-more card. If you're good at the game, you can get to the Lighthouse incredibly quickly.

Passage of Ferocity is changed so you need to win 4 games to go flawless. Every other game you win gives you an extra win. There's a catch. Your matchmaking is adjusted so that you're up against people who are at the Lighthouse Gates for the duration of the Ferocity run. How lucky/good do you think you are? This is probably too complex, unfortunately. Design-wise it's harder to volunteer information on this without making sweeping changes. 

---

#Passage of Wealth

**Objective:** A chase goal for casual and great players alike. Players cannot expect to go easily flawless, but the rewards along the way are excellent, and people who get 3 wins feel like their time has been spent well.

The Passage of Wealth is changed so that each win grants 20 (+10 for each win) tokens, and 10 for each loss. It unlocks on 1 win.


Wins | Tokens | 
:--|:--|
1 | 20 | 
2 | 30 | 
3 | 40 | 
4 | 50 | 
5 | 60 | 
6 | 70 |  
7 | 80 |
F | 90 |
L/B |10|

**Total:** 470 Tokens 

23 packages from Saint-14

Even players who don't do well are incentivized to enter and play to the best of their ability. 1 win, 3 losses, is still 2 packages. 3 wins, 3 losses, is 6.

---

#Passage of Wisdom

**Objective:** A move away from season pass level farming, (which should occur by playing anyway) and a move toward more tangible rewards. Weapons and unlocked armor drop from this, incentivizing people who have unlocked the armor to pick this passage up, and for those that don't have it, to try to unlock it weekly. 

The Passage of Wisdom is changed, with 5 tokens per win, 3 for each loss. In addition, weapons and unlocked armor drop from each win and loss. It unlocks on 3 wins.

Wins | Tokens | Weapons | Armor |  
:--|:--|:--|:--
1 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | |
2 | 5 | 1 Random Weapons| |
3 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
4 | 5 | 1 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
5 | 5 | 2 Random Weapon | 1 Unlocked Armor |
6 | 5 | 2 Random Weapon | 2 Unlocked Armor |
7 | 5 | 3 Random Weapon | 3 Unlocked Armor |
F | 5 | 3 Random Weapon | 3 Unlocked Armor |
L/B |3| 1 Random Weapon ||


**Total:** 49 Tokens, 15 Random Weapons, 11 Unlocked Armor Pieces

2 Packages from Saint-14, 26 drops

Again, players who go 1 and 3 get 4 weapons out of it. If they can get to 3 wins, they get 6 weapons and a piece of unlocked armor.

---

#Passage of Confidence

**Objective:** True ""Hardmode"" Flawless, appealing to the best of the best. The rewards come from the Flawless chest. Casuals should still be encouraged to try for it, and be rewarded for trying, but the big rewards are locked behind the Lighthouse chest. Unlocks on 7 wins.

5 tokens per win, 3 per loss. 

**The Flawless chest drops:** 300 Tokens, 5 Weapons, 3 Masterworked 65+ Base Roll Armor pieces, 3 Ascendant shards

I would prefer it if the Eververse ornaments had a chance to drop from this chest, along with other ornaments for the armor. In fact, I would love it if there were official tournaments each season where the winners chose a weapon each to receive an Osiris-style ornament next season. But these are suggestions that would even less possible than what I am recommending, and I'll include more suggestions in my next section.

---

#Other Suggestions

1. All weapons should, by default, be in the random drop/package pool. 

2. Each week, weapons/armor should be *on rotation*, where you unlock the ability to buy Forge style bounties to make/purchase them. 

3. Armor should not be added to the drop pool after being unlocked, because getting your 4th or 5th class item in a row is not fun. (Or just allow for Armor/Weapon random package selection.)

4. Armor should drop at a *minimum* of 60. 

5. Gatekeeping people from the Lighthouse should be entirely removed. Elitism has no place when trying to resuscitate a dead/dying gamemode. 

6. Account Recoveries should be pursued and shut down. It's not healthy for the gamemode.

7. Introduce ""Adept"" weapons as weapons with 2 options for Weapon Traits, making them more flexible and having increased potential for a godroll. Don't enlarge the perk pool to ""compensate"" for this.

8. Make snipers vulnerable to flinch.

9. A Trials armor ornament for each different Flawless passage. Arms for Mercy, Chest for Ferocity, Head for Wisdom, etc. 

#Conclusion and tl;dr

People shouldn't be afraid to step into trials, even if it's to lose. They should feel like it's worth their time. Even if they get stomped, they got something out of it and can go away happy. They'll show up next week, and the week after that, even if they can only get 3 wins or less. That makes the overall pool of players healthier, which enables these people to also win more often. And even if all they do is lose, lose, lose, they *get something out of it*. They are encouraged to unlock the other Passages, just to lose there! The people who can win win win are rolling in loot, good for them, but the casuals will keep playing. Maybe they'll try for Flawless. Then work on it again the next week. And the next. 

**tl;dr:** Make people feel like their time isn't a hopeless soulsucking hole. They need hope, or at least to be paid for their suffering at more than pity pennies per loss.",3,1585536249,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frisb3/trials_of_osiris_and_how_to_fix_it/,DestinyTheGame,1

I, as foretold, did terrible, focused on the gun game, and we lost. I get that I’m just one person on the team, but I went from a team player to a potato.

Why is this necessary?

Iron Banner is not the place to force experimentation. While the usage data will look better on paper, I’d wager the player experience suffers more than if we had more flexibility in loadout choice.

My suggestion: replace “kills with weapon x” with kills kinetic, special, and heavy. That’ll free us up to pick more of what we may want or are decent with, and it’ll force us maybe a little out of our comfort zones.

Now before this post becomes a shitstorm because of the title, I’m going to share the good parts of destiny becoming f2p. Here is the list:
- it brings in many new players into the destiny franchise allowing players to try out the game if they want and if they they like it they can buy the dlcs to play the game further.

Ok being honest after a while of thinking, that’s al I could think of, but if there’s anymore let me know in the comments. Now let’s get to what I think are bad things.
- PC players are getting absolutely slaughtered by bad guys in trials because if someone gets banned, they can just get a new account and be bad again.
- destiny going f2p has given bungie an excuse to focus more on eververse, and not actual content, because most of it’s free amiright? And yes it is a comment on eververse, but it’s the harsh truth.

Right now overall, destiny going f2p has more good than bad, and that is clearly obvious. Now I’m not saying that destiny going f2p is bad AT ALL. It was an amazing idea that could expand the franchise even furthur, but the problem was that it wasn’t executed right, as certain issues should’ve had more prep beforehand.

Now before and of you mention it, obviously destiny is going to have less content than normal because of activition leaving and losing a lot of resources. But an issue for me is that sooo much has been put into eververse, with cool weapon and armour designs that could easily be added into the game, (like the shadowkeep gear that was recently added into the store)

Anyway, I’m done with ranting now, I’ll let you guys ramble on below and I want to see your thoughts on this, as I am very quickly losing hope in destiny at the moment just because of the shitshow that it is becoming

fri32e,Kir-ius,"Does Trials ""Card Based Matchmaking"" count losses? It should.","My inclination is currently it DOES NOT. 

I'm very certain that it's purely based on wins especially since I've seen games where we break people's trials card while we still have our mercy up meaning we're 2-0 with mercy active still while they're 2-2 with mercy broken. 

I really think the losses need to be factored in which will solve a major problem that the struggling population has in order to keep trials alive a bit longer - which is those who are struggling to hit the minimum milestone of 3 wins to get any reward for their efforts. 

With losses counted in, it'll try to match people who are 2-2 vs 2-2 so then someone will be getting those 3 wins, rather than tossing 2-0 multitime flawless starting their card vs the 2-2 just trying to get their first reward in to turn in tokens. 

Most of those wanting flawless will reset if they lose the mercy at 0, 1 or 2 wins anyways. Those who keep those losses are those who finally hit the 2 win and desperately pushing for that 3rd; or 4th win wanting the 5th; or 6th win wanting their 7th. This way we will reduce the odds of having a 6-2 team facing a 6-0 team when flawless vs 7 wins SHOULD be a big gap but currently means nothing for matchmaking. 

Those top tier players only wanting flawless will reset at any loss, whereas those who just are trying their base to hit milestones will keep those losses if they're so close to that next goal. This will automatically break up the upper tier players from the lower without bringing SBMM in (which will really kill Trials). SBMM will be bad for trials if it matches top tier vs top tier only, or if you're at 3 wins but matchmaking sees a team going for 7 at the same skill it totally fucks over the point of the win streak and card matching.",6,1585533433,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fri32e/does_trials_card_based_matchmaking_count_losses/,DestinyTheGame,1

fri035,Dennis_Brok,Goodbye guardians..,"Im going to delete my destiny 2 character because I don’t want to play anymore, it was fun but I never play other games because of destiny. Getting bored of doing bounties everyday over and over. Don’t get me wrong I love this game! But its time to say goodbye my fellow guardians. 
I just don’t want to be spending all my gaming time bounty hunting anymore. I tried to play again after a break before season of the dawn but It’s simply boring atm.. maybe it will change down the road but I want to move on aswell. 
I enjoyed destiny 1 a lot and I expected the sequel to be better but for me personally its not better at all. Recycling weapons and armor over and over again is not fun anymore, I wanted something new but yeah.. also the retirement of older weapons in upcoming seasons is a good reason for me to stop, all my hard earned loot will be pointless soon. If you read this I hope you have fun and enjoy the game a lot. But for me its over for good! Thanks for the people that helped me over the years and the new people I met along the way. These are just my personal thoughts and opinions on the game, its different for everyone.

frhvg0,SirMushroomTheThird,The bounties in the tribute hall are a perfect example of how bounties should work.,"Take a look at the tribute hall bounties. Upon completion of the bounty, they give you a material that you can turn into the Calus Statue to reduce the cost of the tribute. They are not necessary or required to be able to acquire all the purchasable tributes from the statue. Yes, they are helpful, and you can grind everything out for 80% discount and buy everything super cheap, or you can completely ignore them and buy all the tributes at a ridiculous price. Most players who have bought from the tributes have some discount but most do not have the full 80%. The point being that the bounties are a *secondary* thing to do. On top of that the bounties are not ""50 kills with X weapon"", or ""get 50 X race kills on X destination"". They are all ""do something you would normally like bank motes or kill guardians or strike precision kills, but all *without dying*"". These are not braindead mindless mowing down redbar enemies in lost sectors for 30 minutes, but have you participating with your team in gambit or the strike and you have to actually put a small amount of skill to not punch that cursed thrall (Don't do it).   
If we could but this sort of system into the gambit, crucible, and strike bounties, then a lot of the players would feel a bit more satisfied than the mindless moon bounty spam that is happening right now. For example, what if you were given a consumable that you could turn into Shaxx. Once you did, you would receive extra xp and tokens for completing any crucible matches for the rest of the week, maybe limit 5 per character per week.  (Yes, I am sure that there are problems with this, I'm just brainstorming at this point). Now you have a bounty system that isn't endless spamming, players are no longer fighting over kills with certain weapons, and it rewards you for actually playing the game!   


TL,DR: Tribute hall bounties are good because they are not required to buy all the tributes, but help you buy them at a discount. They aren't mindless objectives and don't have you fighting your team. If the playlist vendors could have a bounty system similar to this it would solve a lot of problems.",9,1585532585,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frhvg0/the_bounties_in_the_tribute_hall_are_a_perfect/,DestinyTheGame,1
frhtzw,Avensol,Interference damage numbers - Full Court vs. Swashbuckler,"So I got myself 2 Interferences, one with spike Grenades and Full Court, the other with Spike Grenades and Swashbuckler. They also have matching Barrel Perks and Masterworks (Confined Launch and Reload Speed) so I could do an apples-to-apples comparison on the damage numbers.

All damage numbers were tested on the Hive Ogre in the Tribute Hall, both Grenade Launchers had a boss spec on them, and the Full Court damage numbers were taken from max range  


|Perks|Damage per shot|1-Mag DPS|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Spike Nades + Full Court|21,188|42,376|
|Spike Nades  + Swash x5|23,952|47,904|
|Spike Nades + No Swash|17,969|35,938|

For 1-Mag burst dps, Spike Grenades and Swashbuckler has a 13.04% increase in damage over Spike Grenades and Full Court, however as you'd expect, the DPS of Swashbuckler falls off heavily afterwards, making it extremely situational. If you get auto-loading holster on your Swashbuckler Interference (mine has it), it might be a viable heavy weapon option for solo-PvE.

***TLDR;*** *Swashbuckler basically turns Interference into a diet Wendigo where the first clip deals insane DPS, but then the DPS dips drastically on the following clip.*",2,1585532427,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frhtzw/interference_damage_numbers_full_court_vs/,DestinyTheGame,1

My current setup is an RTX 2070 with a Ryzen 7 2700x and 16gb ram at 3200mhz. 
I am trying to stream Destiny 2 but for some reason my game often gives me micro-stutters when I stream even though in-game I am getting 100+fps with no fps drops. I’ve tried changing the bitrate, output resolution, nvidia encoder, cpu encoder, everything I can change I have done. I’ve even tried streaming straight from shadow play and the game still stutters. There’s no way my setup isn’t good enough so is Destiny 2 just that poorly optimised for streaming that it’s only possible to actually play the game without issues if using a dual PC setup or am I missing something major here?

frhn3e,khurramchoud,Why do we have light level in PvP still?,"Ok listen, I know this is a skewed opinion because I’m 985 and came back to the game after a 7 month break, but I feel we are at a point in destiny where we shouldn’t have Light Level enabled PvP. Why should someone have to power themselves up to stand a chance in Trials and Iron Banner. I understand that they’re end game content and they’re exclusive for the best of the best, but it almost feels like that if you’re a PvE sweat, you’re at an advantage. Lets say for instance we have one of the best destiny 2 players, SirDemitrious. He’s an insanely good player but he has to use other people’s account to do trials and Iron Banner because his account isn’t leveled and he doesn’t enjoy PvE all that much. I and a good amount of the destiny player base don’t enjoy PvE and only play PvP, but we are forced to play PvE to stand a chance in PvP?. Also another thing, light level defeats the purpose of skill to an extent. I could have someone that has a 3 K/D and is 960 and they’ll lose to some who’s a .8 K/D PvE try hard due to power level advantage. “But bungie wants you to play the whole game to do all the endgame content.”, ok let me put it this way, PvE players don’t have to do PvP activities at all for the most part and they can just do PvE and do all the activities PvE offers without even hovering over the crucible symbol.

We should remove power enabled PvP in destiny 2.",11,1585531681,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frhn3e/why_do_we_have_light_level_in_pvp_still/,DestinyTheGame,1

Something simple yet so helpful. 

CCP, dev of EVE Online, does this. They ask their player base questions based on the last expansion release. Things like:

What were your favorite rewards? What you found to be the most engaging, what you want more of, what you liked, didn't like, ECT.

You should use this as a tool to help develop some of the areas that the players would like addressed. There are a lot of improvements that can be made that would make many happy, and mass feedback is the way to go instead of angry upvoted posts that address one thing.

I feel the voice of the community matters immensely.

If you don't have the catalyst your just annoyed about how the gun is a lesser version of itself with a catalyst opposed to the  Rat King catalyst for example which allows it to do something new.

**Hawthorne**

* Are you still with us?
* Hey, sorry… I’m pretty busy. What’s going on? (Really, you don’t look busy.)
* Did you want to talk to me?
* Is he looking at you funny? I think he was looking at you funny because you’re a bird. (Odd; most gender pronouns in the game match up with the character… not this one, since my hunter is female. No one else was in the vicinity.)


**Zavala**

* No time for indecision! The city depends upon us.
* Much to be done and little time to do it. The pyramid must be dealt with.


**Lord Shaxx**

* The EDZ needs our help, Guardian! Get out there!
* I have an entire Crucible to officiate, Guardian! Don’t make me wait.


**Ada-1**

* It’s okay, Ada… just don’t pay the loitering Guardian any attention.
* Lost in thought, Guardian?
* Guardian! … Hello?
* Admire with your eyes, not with your hands. (What?)


**Asher Mir**

* Are we having a moment?
* It’s hard to calculate with you just standing there!
* This is why I work alone!
* Uhhhh! And so once again I must endure the torture of collaborative silence!


**Spider**

* Don’t be shy! It bores me.


**Sloane**

* Talk fast, I’ve got a lot on my plate.
* What?
* Come on, Guardian! Look alive.


And I should recognize several NPCs that have nothing but nice or informative things to say while you loiter around them: Ikora Rey, Amanda Holiday, Banshee-44, Petra Venj, Failsafe, The Drifter, Devrim Kay. Brother Vance, Ana Bray, Eris Morn, and Kadi 55-30 have a few throwaway phrases, but they're respectful by comparison.

**Some of these phrases are downright annoying to hear. What is their purpose?** For some characters, it could be keeping with character-- Asher Mir, for instance. But the phrases from Hawthorne really grate... she's supposed to be a steward, and friendly to Guardians. We fought beside her in the Red War... so why is she so bothered by our standing near her for a few seconds?

I can imagine a dozen more helpful, insightful, interesting, funny phrases to replace each of these lines. I think they'd make the game more interesting and characters more approachable (literally) than any of these.

frh4he,mallowman12,"Bungie, Fix Trials Immediately With These Two Changes","1. Remove the requirement for players to complete the 3-win challenge in order to turn in tokens for rewards at Saint-14.

2. Rework the Passage of Wealth so that players get progressively more and more tokens from wins, for example 5/3-5/3-7/5-7/5-10/7-10/7-16/10 (read this as the numerator is the tokens won for matches on a flawless streak, denominator is the tokens you win o after a loss).

I understand that the 3-win challenge is useful initially because of the fact that your loot pool is developed as you gain more rewards through the activity, so maybe keep the requirement that players must complete the 3-win until a player does that for the first time, then they can now turn in tokens regardless of card status for the end of time. They simply keep their loot pool that they’ve unlocked.

As far as the Passage of Wealth is concerned, CammyCakes made a good point when he mentioned that the increase it currently provides, it does not truly incentivize the top tier players to use it because of the fact that it adds too much to their loot pool to be worth the extra trouble. My fix mentioned above is certainly not the best idea of a change to the Passage of Wealth, but affords players the option to get 3 rewards via tokens from Saint-14 after going flawless, and 2 rewards via tokens if there is a loss anywhere on the card.

I’m sure that once we get enough weeks into the season and the top tier players have all weapons and armor in their loot pool, then they’ll start running the Passage of Wealth because it means no difference to them since their loot pool can’t expand.

————————-

Another option of a fix is simply this - DO NOT REMOVE TRIALS TOKENS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. If a player’s loot pool does not reset on a weekly basis, then their tokens shouldn’t reset either. Likewise, if one resets then the other should reset too. I can see how some people would still love to token farm the early card in this scenario so perhaps there could be some change also made where players must either have a flawless card/at least one loss on a card in order to reset, OR when a team resets without a loss or flawless, their card-based matchmaking remains locked at their last win streak.

It’s unacceptable to have an end-game PvP activity that is developed in a way that allows top tier teams the capability to consistently farm people trying to have an honest start to their cards.

It’s also a shame that this is the version of Trials that sat on a self being polished for two years.",5,1585529652,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frh4he/bungie_fix_trials_immediately_with_these_two/,DestinyTheGame,1

The removal of leveling and removal of power level under 750 was a huge mistake on Bungie's part, it's literally dozens of hours of content and actually gave a purpose of 2019's content since you needed gear for leveling.

I always wondered with Bungie’s past series Halo, which is way more balanced than Destiny is in its lifespan STILL, speaks words. Why can’t they create a forced loadout or weapons everyone can use instead of being at a disadvantage cause you didn’t get a perfect roll stat meta weapon that you need to spend possibly hundreds of hours by chance, to get. Honestly, it’ll tighten the skill gap and not shy away too many people from pvp modes to stay and do better (i know problems with classes but thats up for Bungie to deal with, honestly I’d rather have class jumping and supers still active but disable passive skills and melee abilities, grenades can stay).

My ELO, however, for trials is Gold 2, top 19%. I'm playing the sweatiest of sweats. I'm seeing people consistently in the top 1% according to trackers. I would have thought that perhaps imy ELO is that high because of all the people that play a game and never do it again but the other stats, kd,kda,kills pga are bottom 20% (My win percentage is only 20%!). I play with 2 similarly skilled guys, we work together but were nowhere near the level the people were getting matched with.

Yeah, I'm hurting as I just got off 10 losses in a row, but surely I shouldn't match against people so much better than me to cause that many losses in a row.

I could just not play trials of course but this season's only offered trials. I've also seen some god awful players with flawless which is confusing to say the least.

So Tl:dr
Fix your matchmaking, penalize players accordingly in Comp, mercy those who have to play down a man, and fix your servers. Almost wish you never left Activision. At least I had stuff to do.

While grinding for 100 hand cannon headshots and working towards 5500 Glory in comp to get my Not Forgotten, I was thrown into a 1v3 and lost 4-1 (Miraculously, I won the first round). Although there is no say on if this is Bungie’s atrocious matchmaking at work, if my two teammates just flat out left before the game started, or even if the infamous beaver caused them network problems, there still needs to be action done to prevent this from ever happening again. For someone like me who has to solo grind to 5500, it’s important for me to win, and win in streaks (I was on a 4 game streak). This is just frustrating as I’m sure with a full team of three, we could’ve won (Not to mention I won one round). Players need to be penalized if they leave, not disconnected via beaver, but just leaves. Have them be penalized with not only their Glory loss, but a set amount of time ban in comp. Now if they were kicked from Destiny’s horrendous servers, then they obviously shouldn’t be penalized. Also, players who are down a player shouldn’t be penalized in a loss. It doesn’t measure your pvp ability, just your bad karma. It’s so frustrating for me and others and just, I don’t have to motivation to play. 

The only reason I’m playing Destiny rn is Comp, Lunas Howl, then not forgotten. I couldn’t give 2 shits about Seraph Towers or the story or anything else. Shit I’ll probably never even use Lunas or Not Forgotten.

The Y3 IB weapons had a cool metal/wood design, while the armor had a wolf design to it. 

Bringing back the d1 trials armor was a good move, but they need to add more loot and make it feel like all players have some chance of getting it. 

Currently, people just reset cards to farm for tokens. That means average players like myself can’t get the loot because we’re being matched against players who already got their flawless, and are just farming for tokens. It drives people away from the game mode.

frfrj0,Daemon7861,The amount of poor decisions reflected in how Trials is today is just astonishing,"Trials is supposed to be the highest level endgame PvP activity, to test players’ skill and mettle. However, the way Trials is right now, it’s more about who has time to light level grind and who doesn’t. Sure this was a thing in D1, but back then the power level differences were not so high. Another problem is the token system. It makes it totally useless to even progress through the card more than once, and gatekeeps other players. Trials is supposed to be hard. We get that. What it isn’t supposed to be though, is inaccessible. Players that aren’t the cream of the crop can’t even get three wins in this elitist system. I’d like to hear your thoughts, where you agree and disagree, and what we think Bungie can do to fix this.

frfr8u,SCB360,"A positive look to improve upon Trials, a discussion, feel free to rant!","So let me preface this by saying I am a bad PVP player in general, hell here's my Tracker stats to prove this:

[https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/psn/SCB360/overview](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/psn/SCB360/overview)

As you can see I have moments, such as 3 wins in Week 1 of Trials but I'm below average imo and very much at the bottom of the K/D lists in matches. As much as I wanna blame my current Hand issues and having to play with a controller again atm, I won't ( especially as my K/D actually went up in spite of it  )

I am also missing regular people or a clan to play with as these all died off over the years :/

However, this lead me to think about how Trials is currently set up and was brainstorming some ideas to improve, so see what you think:

* Get rid of Tokens completely, they become a thing to grind at some points, we saw this last week with the Shotgun grinds and making it 3 wins per week just to hand them in just seems unfair, I have this same issue with IB tokens as well.
* Keep bounties, but make them for playing in general and not for specific things, don't force me to use a Void class or weapon when I prefer Solar for example
* I like the 3,5,7, Flawless set up for Weapons/Armor, however, why not randomize this (and keep the Flawless one something unique, like a curated Roll or higher stat armor or even a Unique Ornament)
   * Alternatively, you could reward players for a completed card win or lose, maybe drop it at the current LL, at least bad players can get something for the time, I like the armor set for example, it'd be nice to at least get a set of it( and allow me to push for Flawless if I want it to glow )
* Have a set of Trials armor, but have a unique set or ornaments for Flawless? It could even be a simple perma glow on the pieces you have

I'm sure I'll think of more and still try every week to get at least the 3 wins, but wanted to note some things down and see what people think",4,1585524629,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frfr8u/a_positive_look_to_improve_upon_trials_a/,DestinyTheGame,5

Freelance has made it a tremendously rewarding experience. With no new raids I've found myself excited to play Survival almost daily. Jumped into Trials the first 2 weekend's &amp; it was soul crushing. Well, not really, I'm fine but you know what I mean. I'm not close to a pvp god, but I can hold my own &amp; if I play well can lead a team in kills. Even won 8 of my 25 Rumble matches for Redrix recently (which I'm pretty proud of) &amp; win around 65% of the Survival matches I play. But I stood no chance in Trials. Freelance would change this &amp; make Trials accessible to us ok to good players without taking anything away from godly 3 stacks going for flawless. If they're worried that that makes it too casual then make separate emblems for going flawless in ""real"" Trials vs. freelance Trials, I couldn't care less. I went in with no illusions of going flawless, but 3 or 4 wins shouldn't be impossible. I know ""get good"" and all of that &amp; I've been trying &amp; will continue to do so.

frfljh,realIndiePhunq,Why do people think Iron Banner is competitive?," 

Title.  I just don't get it, where does the idea that it's one of the most  competitive gamemodes come from? Most people I know seem to rank it  between survival and Trials. But where does that competitive mentality  towards Iron Banner come from?

It's  six-guardian teams, so there's not a lot of pressure for individual  guardians to do well, unlike Trials and survival, where three-guardian  teams put a lot of pressure on the individual. And it's just slightly  modified control, so matches are encouraged to flip-flop between leads  (not that it happens much). The only reasons I could think of that it  might be competitive are that it's run to honor the Iron Lords, which is  exclusively lore, and the fact that level advantages are enabled. And  I'm not convinced that level advantages actually make matches more  competitive. I just think that level advantages give some people an  advantage, so honestly I'd say they're anti-competitive.

So  why do people take Iron Banner so seriously? I just enjoy it because it  has an atmosphere of casual fun, and I do really well when I get into  the flow.

frf1cp,spectre15,Trials of Osiris is on a train about to head off the rails and that destination isn’t too far away. There are some serious problems that need to be addressed or this will suffer the same fate as TOTN.,"I am saying this not with salt but with experience. I have been playing trials almost every day that it has been out every week. I have played with a variety of skilled teams from trash players to guys with flawless emblems who get 10+ kills per game all through LFG since nobody in my clan will play with me. I myself am not bad at the game. 

I feel I have reached my ceiling in skill. I’ve always been good at destiny and FPS games in general. I have some bad games but for the most part I’m your above average player.  In all the matches that I’ve played, they have either been people that can’t aim for nothing or some complete sweat lords that are the descendants of Mtashed and Frostbolt. I have reached this point to where I don’t feel like my skill is going to determine the outcome of the match and neither is my team coordination. Don’t get me wrong, those things do matter in matches but for the most part it doesn’t matter.

What matters is the dice roll of RNG that is matchmaking or trials in general. In my time playing every version of trials that ever existed in destiny, I have never seen it be this bad. In D1 trials I encountered sweats from time to time but I always had fun and felt that I could win. In TOTN it was similar but had more issues. Even on that I still felt that my skill mattered and that we as a team could overcome the odds and win. That’s not the case at all in current trials. Most of the time I go up against a team and after 2 rounds I realize that no matter how I play or my team plays this match, I will lose and I’m sure it’s not just me who feels this way considering only 12% of the community played trials last week.

The root of this problem is that fact that 12% of the community only played trials last week and I can guarantee you around 8% of those players were highly skilled players. Why is this? Lack of rewards or satisfaction for lower scored cards. In trials of the nine for example you at least felt like you earned something out of your trials session even if you didn’t get many wins. Despite the mode’s criticisms, I feel it had a good loot system. There was a sense of physical progression involved. Players were constantly going back and forth from trials to the reward tower where you slowly worked your way to the top by winning and at the same time you could directly deposit coins while doing so to get random weapons. It created engagement that you otherwise couldn’t get from any other mode. That is all gone in trials of osiris.

I can play for 4 hours, work really hard with my team, get 3 wins, and what do I have to show for it? A rocket launcher with bad rolls. Doesn’t matter I’ll just deposit my tokens and get some better guns. Oh wait reset just happened and next thing I know my tokens are gone.

What this mode needs is that engagement that separates it from any other PVP mode. Innovate! Do something different! Just because it worked in D1 doesn’t mean it will work now.

Especially since after you do the raids once on each character you’ll only get glimmer and experience afterwards, but bounties, a way easier thing to do is more efficient? Why can’t every encounter no matter what drops 5 enhancement cores no matter how many times per week. While the first time per character you complete the full raid you get an ascendant shard or two. Extra completions after the first per characters should drop a handful of enhancement prisms. Also add a more generous amount exp per completion per raids. It’s just so stupid how something so easy could benefit you more in a long run than one of the games pinnacle activities. Sure people will say “raids are easy” which I agree with, but only 10% of the player base or so frequently does raids, so it would still make sense for raids to have value over other activities in terms of rewards. Just to clarify I don’t think bounties should have their rewards decreased because if that were the case A.grinding materials and exp would be even more tedious B. if raids or other pinnacle activities would have more generous rewards at the same time as bounties are less rewarding, that’ll hurt the experience for casual players.",0,1585520287,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frejbo/we_need_to_drift_away_from_the_endless_bounty/,DestinyTheGame,1

What's the distinction?","Ive been on PC since Season of Dawn and with Season of the Worthy I've just been doing seasonal stuff so I haven't felt the need to go out and buy the expansions yet.

The past 3 weeks I have gotten several exotics, but I continually asked myself ""Why haven't I got Felwinter's Helm yet..."" It was only after I bought Xur's Fated Engram today that I realized I need Shadowkeep, guess I have to wait for next week to get it on console.

Besides that anecdote there, I don't get the greed here, you let me use my Forsaken and Shadowkeep exotics, I have Shadowkeep quests in my inventory, hell I can complete my season pass on pc (the one I bought on console btw). It just doesn't make sense to me, and because of it, I am forced to go back to console unless I fork up the cash to buy dlcs again when clearly Bungie has the power to allow the transfer of licenses across platform.

What is the distinction there, the Y3 seasons cost the same as Shadowkeep itself and the Forsaken pass...

fre505,vivereFerrari,"I do not understand how Bungie felt this seasons Seraph armor actually looked good, ESPECIALLY the ornaments!","Ok, the season pass armor has never looked that good. The first season it had weeds growing out of it. Last season it looked like Junior Guardian's of the Last City armor or something. But in both cases, the **ornaments** absolutely saved the day and actually made some of those ornamented sets look among the **BEST** in Destiny 2. 

But this season....I just don't get it. I don't understand how this armor, or ESPECIALLY the ornaments, made it through any kind of approval process at all for looking even remotely good. It's absolutely terrible. **The ornaments are probably the worst looking armor set in all of Destiny 2's armor**. Except the motorcycle rider outfit from Eververse this season for the Titan, which is by far the WORST armor set I ever remember in Destiny, PERIOD. But that doesn't really count because it's Eververse and it's an optional purchase. But regarding the season pass armor, that's something we PAY for. It's content that's *INCLUDED* in our purchase of that season DLC, and as such, it should meet a certain standard of aesthetic appeal: **if we are paying for it, it needs to have EFFORT put into making it look GOOD**! It shouldn't look like the artist just threw a bunch of shit together after 1 hour's worth of work on each set and said *That's good enough*.

I miss big content drops that felt like they added story. And you had all this time to play it and level up and you could do it at your own pace. This season pass crap where I have 3 months to play the crap out of the game only to barely start playing the master nightfalls. Only to have the season end and all nightfall levels to jump up is very tiresome. 

I want to play the game but I feel like parts of the game will always be locked off to me because I don't have time to put into it like everyone else does. (Corona virus has changed this for me for the time being but I'm assuming this won't be forever) 

My point is I liked when big content dropped like dreaming city or Kings fall. Where you had time to beat everything. We're you felt like you beat and game and you felt bad ass After gaining all the raid armor and guns. Now you feel like there's no point in raids besides certain guns because all that gear will be under leveled and useless cause it doesn't have the current seasons mod slots available. Cause let's be honest, current season mods are absolutely broken.

frdtbb,DickGuyJeeves,Trials becoming the comp playlist,"I'd like to know how many people consider themselves someone who is casual or above average at pvp who is able to get past 5 or even 3 wins.  Casual would be around a 1.0 kd and above average would be 1.5 to 2 kd overall.  I've noticed that trials of osiris has become nothing more than the competitive playlist time locked to the weekend.  Bungie is trying to get people to play in this playlist but when they actively encourage hardcore players to gate keep the playlist and create a system in which you can efficiently farm casual players for tokens (cammy cakes even encouraged this) I see no reason that the player base should really even try to engage with this playlist unless something they want is tier locked at 3 wins.

There is no special loot for going flawless.  The trials related ornaments are sold for real money in the eververse store, and the only real actual meaningful loot you get for playing trials of osiris and going flawless is a one time grab emblem that actively encourages you to ruin other players experiences.  The reward for skilled players in this game for going flawless is nothing.  There is zero loot incentive.  Instead farming the first 3 wins is better for them.

I know the common response is that the playlist requires extreme skill and prestige to do good in but my rebuttal to that is that's exactly what the competitive playlist is, except its exaggerated by the fact that you need to have a full fire team and light level advantage is enabled.  If bungie keeps this loot system in the game I find it hard to believe that it will a have very long and prosperous life span.

The way Trials of Osiris worked in Rise of Iron is the best the playlist has ever felt in my opinion.

frdlj5,Adkyth,I'm curious about what project Bungie is working on...because Current-Destiny 2 isn't it.,"To start, this isn't a complaint...this is optimistic curiosity.

If you look at pictures (pre-COVID obviously) of Bungie's team and their office, it's massive...but what we are receiving in content doesn't justify such a large team. And with Luke Smith and others voicing about not wanting ""crunch"" or to put too much workload on their team, it begs the question...what are they up to?  


Correct me if I am wrong, but including/since Shadowkeep, in terms of new content we have: 2 Strikes, 1 Crucible map, 1 raid, 1 dungeon, added Lost sectors and quest/patrol areas to the moon, 2 new arenas for Vex Offensive/Sundial, bunkers and the Public Events that were added to the playspace. In terms of gear we have 6 sets per class from the season pass (one regular, then the ornaments), 3 eververse sets per class, 1 raid set, the moon set, and 3 sets of weapons (one per season) with a few ornaments. Then there is the Eververse ornaments and flair. 

We have had a ton of refreshes of previous gear, including bringing back D1 gear, and while I know it's not a simply cut-and-paste, one should assume that it's a far less resource-intensive process to bring forward past gear than to create something new from scratch. Much of our expanded loot pool is simply adding random perks to earlier gear, and most of our ""new"" Crucible maps are old maps brought forward. Trials of Osiris itself is just the old ruleset, old gear, and existing weapon models with a different paintjob and a Trials logo on them. Ordeals and Legendary Lost Sectors are simply adding tweaks to existing instances, and are being trickled out. 

Meanwhile, hit detection on melees is still miserable, connection issues are rampant, balance is as slow and not-balanced as ever, and the lag time for things to be fixed or adjusted is crazy. Exotics need to be disabled because fixes are delayed...and for what appears to be easily identifiable problems...and even things like ""tuning down the number of rocket kills for the IB quest"" take WEEKS to fix...or aren't fixed at all and just passed.   


So this sounds negative, but as I said on the onset, I'm optimistic. There is a lot of manpower available, but not a lot being directed to what-we-have-seen-so-far. I get ""not wanting crunch"", and it's cool that Bungie has that respect for it's team...but it's a tough pill to swallow that SO MANY are actually producing SO LITTLE. So where are the resources going? Truly there aren't massive teams adding a few champions to strikes and lost sectors, or adding current textures/lighting to old gear...so what are they up to?

At this point in 2017, we were getting the Destiny 2 announcement. Forsaken was announced in June of 2018, Shadowkeep in June of 2019..Taken King was announced June of 2015. I don't think we are getting Destiny 3 this fall, but I also think there is a lot of content coming. Bungie has said that this upcoming season (11) is likely going to be the ""you had to be there"" and ""everything comes together"" type situation...and I wouldn't be surprised if Season 11 was the most robust yet, and if it led into another big drop for the fall. Bungie historically hasn't minded ""falling off the radar"" for a while before storming back with something big, and I think 2020 will follow that pattern.",6,1585516943,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frdlj5/im_curious_about_what_project_bungie_is_working/,DestinyTheGame,0
frdlhq,EpicButtLord,Vanguard Engrams SUCK!,"So I’ve recently been farming strikes because the shelter in place armor came back and I’ve noticed that whenever I (rarely) get armor from the engrams, there are no 60+ stat rolls.

Usually, this wouldn’t be an issue...IF VANGUARD ENGRAMS DIDN’T TAKE YEARS TO FARM!! The fastest strike completions are around 6+ MINUTES! That’s if it’s a fast strike, the modifiers are good, and the people are sweating out of their minds! Even then, Vanguard Strike completions grant 4-6 tokens which means it will always take at least 24 minutes to get an engram.

Usually, THIS wouldn’t matter...IF STRIKES WERE ACTUALLY FUN! Whenever I complete strikes, I always go mindless unless there’s a blueberry that skips champions in the Nightfall Ordeal. Unlike crucible matches, a guardian can’t enjoy strikes after the first time they’ve played it.

Now about the Vanguard Engram, it hosts numerous weapons and an armor set. These weapons are decent but, more notably, nightshade and service revolver offer some more competitive rolls. I also like the armor sets this season. However, there’s so much rng and grind involved in getting this loot that people who go for a nightshade will just move to bygones and the people who go for a service revolver will just go for the new seventh seraph revolver. Also, as I mentioned in the beginning, the armor never seems to get any stat rolls that reach beyond 60. This is very infuriating because the vanguard armor looks very cool but world drop, raid, iron banner, and trials armor are so much better in terms of stats.

How I would fix this:
1. Make vanguard engrams cost only ten tokens or make strike completions give 10+ tokens
2. Make Vanguard armor guaranteed to have at least a 57+ stat roll
3. Make strike completions guaranteed to give armor or a weapon if the run was under 15 minutes
4. Give an option for Vanguard boons to be automatic ally used (This is more of a quality of life change)
5. Try to make Strikes unique every time (this is very hard to do), I would maybe add a possible chance of a vex invasion, hive takeover, or fallen assassin which would all drop powerful (and maybe unique) rewards

This concludes my rant

frdcoq,Bob_Ross_mk_2,Shaxx helmet exotic idea...,"I love Shaxx's armour so much and im kinda annoyed that his helmet isn't optainable in game and think it's worthy a new exotic.
Ive had a few ideas for the exotic perk for example, it buffs allies with a reload speed increase and small health regeneration buff, it could be called moral boost, based off of our lord and saviours tendency to SCREAM inspirational mantras as we better ourselves in the crucible.

or maybe it would act like a Celestial Nighthawk but for Titan where it changes the arc super, bottom and top, from many weaker slams to one high damage slam (similar to Destiny 1) with a larger A.O.E  and enemy's outside of the kill zone get electrocuted and given the slowed debuff and the lightning chains between combatants.
This exotic perk could be named Seismic Slam. (this name is debatable but 25 minutes have been wasted so don't change it love you Bungo &lt;3)

Thanks for reading, stay home, stay safe and wash your hands, guardians, Shaxx needs YOU in the crucible!

frcx2v,JoeyGuitar01,PC M&amp;K Players Need To Stop This!,"For the longest time PC players have all talked about how much better a player will be getting better at M&amp;K because the skill ceiling is so high. I have watched multiple streamers mock controller players and call them out when they see them because of their movement and such as if they were easier targets because they are using a controller.

NOW.... Here comes Week 3 of Trials and the map is Widow's Court.

It only took but 2 days for all the M&amp;K players to start blaming controller players for hitting snipes and using Aim Assist. Literally in multiple streams and Twitter threads all I keep reading is people trashing other gamers for using a controller on PC, and how much easier it is to snipe with a controller and win in an engagement against a M&amp;K player. Up until this week, the best players, were all considered M&amp;K players (excluding a few controller players like GernaderJake and others) and now controller players are being ousted for using a controller, and even on some posts even being scorned and told to leave the platform (PC) for using one.

This needs to stop! People, play the game the way YOU want to, and players need to stop blaming and shaming others for using the input that they feel more comfortable with. Also, the hypocrisy has to end. You can't say that the skill gap is so great between the 2 different inputs then get mad because you are losing to the other one. I completely understand frustration in a competitive atmosphere, but this is going way past that and people just want to play the game and have a good time.

finallby complete whisper because it's one of the few quests that 1. I have the time to complete and 2. is soloable.

then I'll finally hit up strikes. Strikes are some of the most mine numbingly dull gaming experiences I've ever had. ever. I loathe doing them because they havent been truly updated since day 1 over 4 years ago. It's not a mindset of ""oh I need to play strikes real quick. I'm glad they're adding **at least one every 6 months of a year** since we're paying each quarter for content and a larger purchase every year. 

then I travel to Eververse to look at the coolest stuff I'd love to have the most, but will never pay $8 for a finisher or or $15 for a set of ornaments. $2 for a projection or $4 for an emote. Which is quite insulting players that have been dedicated fanboy/fangirls since day one, during times when you had zero business having any. We're not asking for free new shit, but adding some things in from a couple seasons back would be nice. Charging for content 6 months old is kind scummy. 

Is this your vision that set out to create? I can't imagine you're at all happy with the state of the game. Creating a single activity and changing around some difficulties while simultaneously put activity specific conent, even cosmetic, behind a paywall when the geear that is awarded is paltry at best.

“I wish to see where the darkness ends.”  

The universe is vast and pitiful. It is empty, but more so, it is *full* of *emptiness.* The need for more is everywhere. The child, begging her parents for more toys, is but a microcosm of the scope of void that is consuming the universe. And within that void, there exist two prime forces: The Darkness, and the Light.  

“The light?”  

The Darkness is everywhere and on all sides. It surrounds you, is inside of you, beyond the comprehension of your mind.  

“I can comprehend quite a lot.”  

Beyond the comprehension of *your* mind. Shhh.  

Kelda bit her tongue at the rebuke.  

The Darkness fuels everything you touch. Take from one thing to make another. Destroy to create. Eat to live. The Darkness is chaos, but it is also fair. It obeys the laws it writes. The Light obeys no laws, not even its own. It creates from nothing. Produces energy without fuel. Power without effort. It brings the dead back from death, and removes life from the cycle.  

“This sounds incredible.”  

Incredible? So says the Dark. For consumption requires intake, and what better source of nourishment than one that is unending, eternal, and beyond all comprehension?  

“Are we the dark?”  

This universe is Dark.  

“And the Ascendant Plane?”  

Dark.  

“The Throne Worlds?”  

So very Dark.  

“So where does the light come from?”  

It doesn't. That's not how it works. You should listen more and question less.  

“Then tell me. I'm listening.”  

The wish is ended. You know now where the darkness ends. Let that knowledge be enough.  

“It's never enough; you know that. One answer leads to ten more questions.” Kelda shook her head. “Every time.”  

One day, Kelda, you will learn all of the answers, but you will not like what that knowledge costs you.

“Do you like what it cost you?”  

Kelda, child, I do not know anything until it is asked of me.  

“So what did your gifts cost you?”  

The price has not been paid in your time, and you will not live to see the cost come due. It bears no consequence. I have agreed to it, and if you trust me to give you true guidance, you must trust me that you need not know any more of this than you now do.  

“Of course I trust you, Riven,” Kelda lied. “Of course.”  

Riven laughed in a chorus of voices. A laugh track of everyone Kelda had ever known. And it felt every bit to Kelda that they were laughing at her.

frbxyk,Full-Arcadia,I genuinely wanted to return to the game today.,"Decided to take a break for this season, go back to Destiny 1, start a fresh account (been a lot of fun, actually, cannot recommend it enough). 

Today I thought about going back, doing some of the higher level seasonal content. Then I remembered that I still cannot use any of my favourite loadouts in it: all due to the fact that this content is saturated with Champions and you, Bungie, don't let me use the weapons that I like (and my favourite subclass) to effectively combat them. 

For me, using the stuff that I love = having fun. Having fun = playing the game. Needless to say, when I'm forced to use things that I don't like in activities, where I'm supposed to be at my best, my desire to do this content disappears completely and utterly – it's no longer fun and enjoyable for me, because it kills the class/power fantasy and, therefore, feels like a chore. 

Bungie, you keep telling me how your game is all about ""playing the way I want"". I feel like you have a very perverted understanding of this principle – Destiny 2 has become a game that’s mostly about being pressured to play the way your game designers want, rigidly **enforcing** diverse play, **rather than supporting players in playing the way they want**. Please, could you reconsider your approach to this? 

The easiest way to improve the current system would be to make Champion mods universal – applicable to any (including exotics) weapon (in a separate second mod slot, so that it would not interfere with the performance of a gun like it does now) and subclass, regardless of its type (for weapons) and elemental affinity (for a subclass). 

**TL;DR**: another whiny post telling Bungie about how their Champion mods system is kinda restrictive and not as fun as it might originally seem.",48,1585511197,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frbxyk/i_genuinely_wanted_to_return_to_the_game_today/,DestinyTheGame,3

frbtpq,ThunderFi,The state of the game and Bungie's lack of communication on many topics makes me feel like they don't care about Destiny 2 any more,"I'm a pretty hardcore Destiny player and it hurts me to see how Bungie treats this game and its players. They say one thing and do something else. One of the bigger examples is the ""Play how you want to play"" marketing.

I'm not a developer and I don't like trying to be an armchair developer, but honestly I see so so so many obviously great suggestions to make this game better (either new features or fixes to current ones) and the only thing from Bungie we get is a statement ""We see your feedback/We're listening"", if we even get that. I'm sorry but it's SO FRUSTRATING to see Bungie ignore great suggestions/feedback. Could Bungie at least tell us why you're not going to do something if you're not going to do it? Of course Bungie is not forced to answer why they aren't doing something, but when the state of the game is what it is right now and the community is giving good suggestions to the problems we have I feel like we could use at least an explanation? At least tell us why the issues exist and what you're going to do about them?

Bungie's actions have made me lose almost all respect for the company and I used to love them (Halo is my favorite franchise of all time). To me it feels like they don't want to do anything that doesn't bring in straight revenue and fast. A couple examples: Pit of Heresy had the death bug where you could die randomly while transitioning from one encounter to another and it took almost 6 months to fix that. Last season the EDZ obelisk was bugged for at least 1,5 months before it was fixed, you couldn't access it without loading to the area again and again. Once it took me 10+ tries before it worked. It seems like they don't either have enough people to playtest, or they don't have enough people to fix the issues, or they just don't care that they're pushing BROKEN TIME LIMITED CONTENT and just broken content out to their players. This season 2/3 of the new exotics are now disabled because they're bugged. Honestly, what is going on Bungie?

This season's content drops feels like the absolute bare minimum. Last and this season there seems to be more and more problems and things being broken. To me and to many others it seems and feels like Bungie is using D2 as a cash cow while they develop something else. This game and franchise has so much potential but Bungie seems to refuse to let the game live up to its potential. How more many years do we need to wait until this franchise reaches that potential?

Before I'm being called entitled and whatnot I ask you to hear me out. I'm not saying that Bungie needs to do something I'm saying, I'm not trying to decide anything for them. I don't claim to know better than Bungie, I'm not saying that what I say is the absolute truth. **I'm simply saying how Bungie's actions seem to me and how they make me feel**. The state of the game isn't good right now and my trust in Bungie's ability to fix it is not great. The biggest reasons for all of this are the lack of transparency and communication on many topics. 

I'm sorry for the rant and the negativity but I love this game so damn much, though at the same time this is the most frustrating game I've ever played. Not because of difficulty or game mechanics, but because its developer seems to not care about the state of their own game. Maybe I should start caring less.",112,1585510781,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frbtpq/the_state_of_the_game_and_bungies_lack_of/,DestinyTheGame,0

At the least, upon a player going flawless that week, please pair them against players who have as well exclusively. That'd lessen the skill gap so much and make the game mode more enjoyable and fair for the majority of players. A better solution is a redesigned skill ranking that'd take a ton of variables into account rather than just ELO (which was originally designed for 1v1 games) but I understand that'd take a ton of time, energy, and effort and it's by no means a simple solution.

Its pretty simple.  

* 1.  All looks in the game get added to your Wardrobe once you get them the first time.
* 2. Make a cash shop currency for applying skins not from the cash shop.

Not too much to this.  We all get any look we want.  We still need to grind for new gear and stats.  Bungie has a new source of income and no longer needs to ""bring back"" old skins.  They can focus on new stuff and we can all enjoy it.  This would also let us have looks like the solstice or forge skins and be able to use seasonal mods.

Anyways, I always thought the 2.0 armor system was a step in the right direction but I never understand why they stopped just short of letting us use all skins in the game.

frath0,Flingar,How I would bring back Trials of the Nine as a pinnacle Gambit activity,"**Changes to the gameplay itself:**

Trials of the Nine would be structures as a form of Gambit Prime with the Trials win system. Light level would be activated, but only for the enemies. Light level would still be disabled against other players. In order to implement this, enemy light level would raise as you bank more motes. The game would start at 940 from 0-25 motes, and raise by 30 for every 25 motes, culminating at 1030 during the 75-100 mote stretch and the final boss. Upon banking 100 motes, the team would be teleported into the Unknown Space to fight the Oryx boss from the Reckoning. 

**Rewards Structure:**

Upon reaching 7 wins ang going flawless, the Emissary will guide you to the Court of the Nine, where you will earn your rewards. In the Court of the Nine, there would be 4 chests to choose from; one for each of the Gambit Prime roles. Choosing a chest will grant you the following rewards:

* A masterworked piece of True Armor. (For example, choosing the Collector chest will give you a piece of True Collector armor.)
* Any one of the original Trials of the Nine weapons, with revamped stats and perk combos so that they aren't terrible like they were in Y1.
* The Malfeasance catalyst
* An emblem
* A random Nine-themed cosmetic
* An Ascendant Shard

**What exactly does True Gambit armor do?**

True Gambit armor would have the ability to activate a fifth perk that becomes active at 18 points. (the five pieces of armor + respective synth. This would mean that you would have to forgo your exotic.) These effects would only be active in Trials of the Nine.

Here are what the 18-point perks would be:

* **True Reaper:** Halves all damage from non-Taken combatants. Dramatically increases Super regen while surrounded by enemies. Effect is reduced while being invaded.
* **True Collector:** Triples Mote pickup radius, and you gain priority over your allies for picking up Motes. Dramatically increases Super regen based on the number of Motes held. Effect is reduced while being invaded.
* **True Invader:** Gain a significant chunk of Super energy upon entering the Invader portal. Killing Guardians grants additional invasion time. 
* **True Sentry:** Halves damage from Blockers and Invaders. Automatically spend your Super energy to nullify damage from an Invader's super for yourself and nearby allies. Each ally defended costs 1/4 of your Super energy, including yourself.

**Who would the vendor be?**

In order to give him a new role in the game, Xur would be this mode's announcer and vendor. You would be able to turn in your tokens to him in order to get items from the entire TotN loot pool, including True Armor. Xur would also sell all of the existing Trials passages, including a new one, called the Passage of Consolation, which grants you 9 tokens for each win on your card upon your 3rd loss.

frapcd,rezmeihaveghorn,Please don’t let trials die again,"As someone who is massively disappointed with the new trials, I’d like to make a small request, please don’t let trials die again, bungie. The solution is there, we keep saying it over and over, but you don’t hear us. It’s like you don’t care. The loot system is garbage and exploitable, I don’t think anyone would care if you just copy and pasted the old system from d1, it would fix a lot, the sweats resetting at 3 wins would hopefully stop, casuals could actually get weapons without going flawless and in turn come back to the playlist.

Adept weapons can’t be that hard to make, slap a new coat of paint on the gun and give it a unique intrinsic perk, going flawless gives you those weapons. Make adept armor that permanently has the glows, you only get the pieces by going flawless, you can pick from the whole set of armor which piece you want, and one weapon from a selection of three, once you get every piece of armor you choose 2 adept weapons when you go flawless.

This is all stuff that’s been done before, right down to choosing a piece of adept armor, that was in trials of the nine, please do not let trials die again, give us new pinnacles only obtained from trials, give us literally any incentive other than a stupid flow to go flawless in trials, it’s gonna die if you don’t. It’s probably already dead, there’s no reason to play.

frao47,Hollywood_Zro,In Defense of Paul Tassi...it’s great that people with a voice are in tune with the dedicated player.,"Paul gets a lot of crap from this subreddit. But if you listen to Destin on IGN Fireteam chat or the Tefty on DCP crew or any streamer or podcaster, they are all saying the same thing.

Heck, Datto, the golden boy of this sub has also said that he’s tired of menagerie lite every season, doesn’t like having to swap weapons for daily kill with X weapon bounties, and raid loot isn’t meaningful. 

Does he get destroyed for rehashing what the subreddit already said? His videos aren’t being released BEFORE we post. But we give him a pass.

Paul, on the other hand, gets crushed anytime he writes one of his articles.

Take a step back. Paul being in tune with this player base here is a GREAT thing. It means he’s not a casual player. He gets the issues and can give it a voice in another channel.

This week the DCP crew had some gal streamer on their podcast and she was WAY disconnected with the player base. I could only listen to like 5 minutes and had to turn it off. She seems like a streamer who is trying to be a Destiny streamer but doesn’t know much about Destiny. Tafty asked her if she had Anarchy. Her response? Gee, I don’t even know if I have it. I don’t use exotics much so I don’t even know.

I’m glad we have someone like Paul Tassi representing the dedicated player base because it would be A LOT worse. Paul is verified on Twitter and the Bungie crew know him and can see his comments, feedback, and twitter replies. It’s a GOOD thing that people who have a platform and are verified (which gives them amplification to their message) are in tune with the general dedicated player base. 

Listen to Paul Tassi on the Rageless Roundtable from Say No To Rage and you’ll see that he knows his stuff. Paul is also on the IGN Fireteam chat from time to time.

**Step 1** - Fund a supervillain’s weather controlling machine.

**Step 2** - Pick up the following Dailies. [Weeklies can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq2chr/optimized_bounties_for_3272020/)

frac1q,elbowfracture,"Week two of trials was not only bad for trials, it sent shockwaves throughout the game, and I worry that Destiny the game may not recover.","This sounds sort of alarmist.  Let me explain where I’m coming from. 

I have put more time in the game then probably all my friends combined. I’m in the top 2% of time wasted, having spent 2,501 hours in the game.  

Destiny is my first pvp game.  And I would say the majority time that I have played, was in crucible. New content drops? You’ll find me in the crucible getting my levels there. 

Was I bad in PVP?  Yup. I didn’t really care really if I died. I mean you were back in the game within 10 or 15 seconds. I’d jump back in and then just be a shoulder charging fool. KD?  Who cares.  Looking back, I’m sure this really screwed up the game for some serious players as I probably made spawn flipping more frequent, scattered the opposing team, and created all sorts of nonsense.

I absolutely love PVP.  Last season,  I started trying to improve for the first time. I watched some videos, started listening to old episodes of Crucible Radio, and got better. Got my Lunas Howl, and made it to Legend for the first time, getting my Not Forgotten. All solo queue.  I have never relied on a team to carry me.

So, last week, when a team of average+ players and I went into Trials and barely got to game 3 after hours and hours, it stung. I know my limitations, I know I’m pretty average. But be pitted against three unbroken‘s with seven flawless games on game ONE or even game two. That was something else.  We’ve all seen the stats from last weekend. 5% of the population getting to just three games.

Honestly this goes beyond being disappointed. I used to live and breathe Destiny.  But this has taken the wind out of my sails.  The last few nights my girlfriend has been out of town. I could’ve played all night for days. Instead I watched comedy specials on Netflix. I’m not gonna lie, I played a few games here or there, but it’s not the same. 

I used to see the trials emblems and gear as a really cool addition to the game.  The gear looked amazing and I really said something about your accomplishment. It was like seeing my first Raid gear in D1.  I remember being at the tower, thinking “Wow” where did that gear come from and how do it get it.  Now when I play crucible and I see the trials emblem, do you know what I think? Oh, God. Let’s keep an eye out on that shotgun trashbag.  You know what I think when I see trials armor now? Somebody carried that poor fool, or “here we go again.”

I bet you can guess who did not play trials this weekend?  Me.  I just hope the game, as a whole, gets its luster back for me. Because today I haven’t even turned the Xbox on.",11,1585505586,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/frac1q/week_two_of_trials_was_not_only_bad_for_trials_it/,DestinyTheGame,0

fr9vmq,Gruezi_Mitenand,"Bungie, your game is failing.","How long is it going to be until we stop getting reskinned armor, weapons, and content?  



Who in the right mind at Bungie went, “yea, let’s just bring back all the old season’s stuff, they’ll like that”.  I get the fundamentals of it, but in lieu of new designed content/gear that is such a lazy decision.  


Shadowkeep was supposed to be you guys ushering in a New Light for Destiny, a world where things change as you play.  Since then, each season has gotten slower and slower, and the rewards to go after are the same ones everybody has already gotten times and times before.  *Except with different perks and slightly different looks, wow!*  Hell, even the worlds you’re “changing” stay pretty much the exact same when the season ends cause you just take everything away.


I know, New Lights and Kinderguardians will be swift to say “I haven’t gotten X and Y before, so I like it”.  The other bad factor is that the game is fun to play.  The destruction and choice of weapons to kill with is nothing comparable to any other game out there.  Destiny is masked by how fun it is to play, and you guys know that.  Hence FOMO.


I didn’t even know what that stood for till you guys introduced it in SK.  I realize I have the decision when it comes to choosing to play or not.  The point of my post is you’re slowly killing off Vets, Speedrunners, hell, even some Streamers that play your game as a job yet supporting the casual because when you pick this game up brand new you have so much to do and see.  How easy is it to wow and oogle new people vs. keeping older players happy?


You take something that was D1, in all its glory, the best starting platform you ever could have had.  Then release D2 with absolutely nothing to do.  Over the time, you built it back into something decent and Forsaken definitely brought more people back than TTK did.  Yes, finally, a Destiny to stand behind.
Even splitting with Activision was a huge victory, and the community was ever so pleased with that decision.  

But you’re doing the same thing with this game as you did in the last, you’re letting it go, and all it takes is your community to leave for you to get your shit together.  When you should have your shit together from the get go with a strong vision that you can relay Season after Season or game after game.

I am not a developer, I am not a creator, streamer, or even a noteworthy player around space.  But I’ve seen you abandon your game once only to fix it to now see you do it all over again??  

Bungie, it’s so beyond simple to think to release NEW stuff that at this point I can’t help but think you’re focussed entirely on something different.  Perhaps your fix it all solution once the Almighty comes crashing into us at the end of Worthy?  Oh please strip me of my vault.

Let me say this again, for the people that took offense, how do you have a game with hundreds of different elements, aspects, weaponry, cosmetics, play-spaces, enemies, and you can’t think to design something else that would keep the dumb people that continue to support your game happy for a while?
I am one of these dumb people that supports your game and I also spend a bit of cash at the void pit that is EV.  

I don’t want you to fail, I’ve seen you fail before only to hit myself in the head when you’ve magically brought the game back due to missing out on ornaments and other cosmetic things I wish I had.  

I don’t want Cozmo or DMG to reply to this asking what would I like to see different only to pitch my ideas out into nothing and have it relayed to nothing because they’re bullheaded at the studio and only worried about nerfing snipers and fucking with a PvE meta that I believed was fixed once Auto-loading was taken away.  

I don’t really know what I want out of this game or you, Bungie.  At the end of the day, it’s all in your hands.  Just please for the love of god look at what you’ve been doing for the last few seasons: 

Taking away Prismatic Facet for more earn-able cosmetics, putting more attention into EV as opposed to thinking, “what if we put some of these cosmetics as STRIKE SPECIFIC LOOT IN CERTAIN STRIKES THAT DONT HAVE THIS” or just in the world in general.  Thinking that snipers actually needed to be nerfed back to Pre-SK fully and not even consider doing half of that nerf instead, as well as singlehandedly fucking with Izanagi and at the same time allowing a gun like Hardlight to exist let alone dominate the PvP-sphere.  Yet, you can just freely disable exotics as soon as there’s a bug on them.  Having old reskinned Trials loot in lieu of new gear, taking out certain trackers on emblems yet keeping some???  Having your Seasons be “collect X and turn it in” simulator.  Bounties.  My god how lazy the bounty system is yet it’s something people still do cause there’s nothing else to do lol.  Taking away a skill that had to be learned and was perfected in its own community; Worldline Skating.  Literally adding back old exotics from D1 as some sort of fun event/thing to look forward to?  Just give it back to us without the cool quest because we earned it in fucking D1.  Reskin.  VENDOR REFRESH.  Why not update Xûr or Ikora to have ornaments or catalysts that could be earned/worked towards instead of buying them from the god damn store or getting them as some sort of quest (Eriana’s, Symmetry, Tommy’s).  Actually taking out a Flawless requirement for a Raid to earn a Seal without no communication on it for 6 months.  Wow.


Should I continue?  Does it matter?


Bungie, I hate that I love you, and I love to hate you because you make it so god damn easy.  The day your game falls because of your bad practice is the day I look for a new trailer on your next plan c.

SBMM (I think. I played right before it was cut.)

Flawless armor but also non flawless armor
Unique weapons never seen before but with fixed rolls

No flawless weapons that I recall (but there was a flawless shader I think)

Weekly challenges instead of bounties (these were the three things you saw when you brought up your ghost in Y1.)

Locked loadouts

Countdown/survival. 

4v4

Token system without a restricted loot pool

 Double primaries


Trials of Osiris:

Connection based/card based matchmaking 

Reskinned armor that we’ve seen before

 No flawless armor

Reskinned Weapons that we’ve seen before but with random rolls 

Bounty system to earn tokens

Token system with restricted loot pool (for all your shotgun farming desires)

3v3

Elimination

No locked loadouts 

No double primaries 


Just wanted to throw a comparison of the two into the mix here. Don’t know how many people were around for Trials of the Nine but playing at the end of its lifespan feels really similar to how it is now with Trials of Osiris 3 weeks in. I think there are some things that could be (should be?) taken from Trials of the Nine and incorporated into Trials of Osiris.

fr9pzl,pooey04,Trials question. bugged??,"I think there is a bug. last week I went flawless therefore my loot pool is The shotgun the AR the arms and chest. So I got the same team together last night it was indeed before reset we got three wins figured out that none of us could turn in tokens and we all got off till today. We just reset our passage got 4 wins decided to go to saint-14 and turn in tokens and grab extra bounties and we still could not turn in tokens witch is very very frustrating. We just decided it was bugged. One of our team mates didn’t have the arms and wanted them we got 5 wins since we heard arms are at 5 now, after we decided this week there wasn’t a three win reward and he did not get the arms and neither did anybody else. We decided that if there was and issue we should save our passage and just do some activities until it gets fixed. We received feedback to try restarting the game we did nothing happened.

fr9ks1,W34KN35S,My Opinion of the Flaws In Crucible and what could be improved (PC)(Only applies to PC),"&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*PC PLAYER\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Im of the belief that you balance from the top down in other words if something cant be abused or is balanced for the top percentile of players then it cant be abused by the rest of the players and will be balanced.

&amp;#x200B;

Also regarding the word balance, I think most people know that absolute balance is practically impossible. So when I use the word balance I am saying ""balanced up to the point where it isnt noticeable"" example ....prometheus lens was ""noticeable"" when it was destroying everyone. Hand Cannons are noticeably better than most weapons, Hardlight is noticeably better than most weapons. True or Optimal balance should leave the community questioning whether the weapon was overpowered or was it just the fault of the individual player. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Reduce the Team Sizes or Increase the Map Size- 

&amp;#x200B;

Reduce the team sizes-Currently I feel that the current TTK does not encourage any player to move around the map by themselves. While this may not seem like a bad thing to  some , it does incentivize team to always stay together and then we get the hand-holding meta that we have now. If your honest with yourself can you remember the last time you had a 1v1 and your opponents teammate came in to finish you off. This seems to be the normal now in all matches: Start an engagement with someone only to be interrupted by another player either on your own team or the enemies team. 

&amp;#x200B;

or 

&amp;#x200B;

Increase the map sizes, make them larger so players have more ground to cover and thus you get more 1v1 engagements.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Increase the Zoom on snipers-Snipers, at least on PC dominate from every range. In all of the games I play I see snipers challenging Smg's, shotguns, sidearms , all weapons  thought to be used in close quarters but instead they are getting beat in short range engagements. I understand that it is considered a skill to use a sniper , but just because it is considered a skill doesnt mean it has to dominate all ranges. Let close quarter and even medium range weapons have their territory as well.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Increase the flinch received on sniper rifles,hand cannons, and pulse rifle users. Semi Automatic weapons in this game are still able to counter fully automatic weapons , keep in mind that fully automatic weapons have to deal with recoil and bloom along with all the other things that semi automatics have to deal with. If both weapon types are hitting their shots within their respective ranges than they should kill each other at the same time. As it stands though a skilled semi automatic user will still easily beat a skilled fully automatic user.I feel like this isnt a big concern of anyone because most people dont use fully automatic weapons in this game.  

&amp;#x200B;

4. Make flinch received for sniper rifles, hand cannons, and pulse rifle users random- I dont know for sure if it isnt already but if not then it should be implemented, essentially for the same reasons as stated above.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Increase the Sound of Movement- If someone is jumping in the air we should be able to hear them, using sound is important in any game. If someone chooses to engage while in the air then we should be able to hear them. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Increase the Sound of Spectral Blade- this should be common sense , It has incredibly fast movement , can see through walls , and go invisible ,so why can we not hear it until it is right next us. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. Reduce Body shot damage for Auto Rifles- Head shots should incentivized  for all weapons. 

&amp;#x200B;

8. Balance PC and Console separately. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there are plenty more that could be listed.

I get that these are kind of long and repetitive, but these are just ideas. If Bungie takes this idea into account, they'll think of better names.

On a side note: whenever in Gambit Prime, there should be titles of their respective role and points in that role just so people know what role they are playing without having to look at what armor they're wearing. For example:

Invader: 12
Collector: 15
Sentry: 9

fr98v4,CinclXBL,"Trials of Osiris, Skill Gap, and Skill Creep (The Data So Far)","There has been a lot of discussion about Trials of Osiris and the accessibility of its various rewards.  Anecdotally, players on this subreddit seem to have had particular difficulty with getting to 3 wins, with last week (Week 2) seeming particularly difficult for a lot of players.  Since I'm bored and under a stay-at-home order, I figured I would see what the data bore out on Trials.  Here are some results, with preliminary conclusions, to follow.  TLDR:  Skip to the Conclusion.

&amp;nbsp;

First off, lets take a look at how many players are getting at least 1 Win, 3 wins, or going Flawless over the past Two Weeks.  I pulled data from Braytech, Light.gg and Charlemagne.  Note that the first two pull from a smaller pool of registered users while Charlemagne pulls from all users (aside from a very, very small percentage of players that opt out of having their data tracked.)  
&amp;nbsp;

||1 Win (Lifetime)|3 Wins (Lifetime)|Flawless (Lifetime)|
:--|--:|--:|--:|
||Source: Lore Book - Chapter 1: Instigate|Source: Hardened by Trial Emblem|Source: Flawless Emblem/s|
|Braytech|36.34%|28.33%|13.55%|
|Light.gg|37.32%|28.14%|11.60%|
|Charlemagne|0.913%|0.741%|0.269%|

&amp;nbsp;

So, first off we have some fairly obvious conclusions.  Braytech and Light.gg present a subset of players that are much more likely to participate in trials, while the very vast majority of players that have played have never won a match (or probably never even played trials.)  This is unsurprising since D2 is F2P and millions of players have been recorded over its 2+ years of existence.  Most of them are waiting for RNG to make the Taken Blight Heroic instead of sweating in Trials (and we love them for it.)

&amp;nbsp;

Still, only around 36-37% of players recorded by Light.gg and/or Braytech have ever won a match.  Lets take this universe of players, however, and assume for a moment that it can represent a set of players that have at least some success in trials.  What is the furthest extent this subset of players go into their cards?  

&amp;nbsp;

||Of All Recorded Players with 1+ Win(s)| | |
:--|--:|--:|:--|
||% with 3 Win Emblem|% with Flawless Emblem||
|||||
|Braytech|77.96%|37.29%||
|Light.gg|75.40%|31.08%||
|Charlemagne|81.16%|29.46%||

Here we see that, over the lifetime of ToO so far, players that are able/willing to get a Win in ToO are likely to get a three-win card at some point.  The chances of going flawless, however, are not so great.

&amp;nbsp;

So that does it for lifetime numbers that are easily tracked by emblems.  We see that players are either not playing or struggle to get a single win, but if they are playing/able and get a win they are very likely to get 3 wins (~78.2%.)  A substantial minority of players (~21.8) are unable to get to 3 wins after playing trials and scoring at least 1 win.  An even greater percentage of players will not go Flawless, despite clearing the 1-win mark (~67.39.)  This makes a certain amount of sense as the number of players who are engaged with ToO and/or winning decreases the further along we get into different tiers of rewards.

&amp;nbsp;

The remaining issue is that of ""skill creep,"" particularly with reports of players being increasingly unable to get even a single kill or 3 win card last week.  This was particularly noticeable for players as the reward for 3-wins was hyped up by content creators as the best shotgun in the game (more or less.)  So lets see how players fared from week to week. 

&amp;nbsp;

|% of Players with 3-Win Reward for Each Week|Week 1 - The Scholar|Week 2 - Astral Horizon|Week 2/Week 1||
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
|Braytech|22.95%|22.06%|96.12%|-3.88%|
|Light.gg|23.46%|15.62%|66.58%|-33.42%|
|Charlemagne|0.519%|0.529%|101.93%|1.93%|


&amp;nbsp;

Here we see our first big divergence between sources.  Braytech and Charlemagne show a slight decrease and slight increase in week-to-week 3-win rewards respectively.   Light.gg, however, shows a nearly 1/3 decrease in players getting the Week 2 reward compared to the Week 1 reward.  Still, Charlemagne shows that MORE players received the Week 2 reward than the Week 1 reward (and Charlemagne counts everyone.)  This could be because the Week 2 reward was more desirable, though it also came during a week where many players did not receive rewards due to issues with Trials resetting.  So: who knows why but more folks got it in total.

&amp;nbsp;

More likely, the issue comes down to a subset of players running into more difficulties than the broader population which Light.gg somehow captures and which we see show up on this subreddit in the form of anecdotes. 

&amp;nbsp;

Conclusion:
Players of all types  are finding difficulty getting wins, though those that have managed to squeak out a win at least once have managed to get a 3-win reward at some point.  A subset of players that Light.gg captured (though Braytech did not) experienced either substantially more difficulty getting a Week 2 reward than a Week 1 reward or just didn't play as much during Week 2.  Either way, I see from the data that substantial portions of players are able to find success to some degree, though we might see increasing difficulty for certain players as player habits change.  Whether this is suggestive of early-onset skill creep in ToO will require a bit more data to suss out.  Charlemagne tracks real-time, and I'm currently compiling some results but this post is more than long enough as it is. Please let me know if any errors exist in my data or there are any other context/conclusions you have to add.",58,1585501766,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr98v4/trials_of_osiris_skill_gap_and_skill_creep_the/,DestinyTheGame,3

fr946i,NaxxD,Perk suggestions,"Thought it might be cool and helpful to contribute some perk ideas that could be implemented into the game but veer away from power creep either for D2 or D3 (if that’s gonna b a thing). I intend these for a legendary guns instead of Exotics. Names are placeholder. 

Slipstream: 
- Increased ready speed and ADS speed immediately after sprinting.

Incandescent shot: 
- Aiming down sights for a short duration loads a blinding shot into the magazine disorienting / blinding targets. Precision kills with incandescent active blinds in an aoe radius. 

Timely Rythm: 
- Pacing firing in between shots with your weapon’s fire rate grants stacking stability and reload speed. 
*You do not have to hit a target for this perk to activate*. 

The Eleventh Hour:
- The final two shots in a magazine, if fatal, create elemental explosions that chain to nearby targets and   grant health regeneration on successful chains.

Manna from heaven: 
- Masterworked weapons have a chance of dropping two orbs of light. Bonus damage is granted for the weapon once the orbs are picked up until reloaded or swapped. 

Contingency: 
- Kills &amp; consecutive precision shots landed on targets moderately overflows grenade energy. Once full it grants increased explosion radius and weakens enemies caught by it. [Sounds a bit exotic can’t lie].

Decisive engagement: 
- Rounds overpenetrate. Targets hit behind the initial target take increased damage and if killed, explode. 

Superposition: 
- Dealing damage with this weapon inflicts the
target for a short duration, switching to another weapon and dealing damage on the same target reloads bullets into the magazine on shots landed. 

Sandpaper (similarities to slideshot):
- Sliding grants slightly increased precision damage and precision kills while active extend the duration of the buff.

All I got so far. It’s kinda mad to think about new perks that don’t expand upon the already large amount ones that exist and even harder to not make them all about damage but have their strength in utility. 

Anyways hope u found this interesting even if the list is small. Suggest some that u think would be cool to experiment on and give Bungie some ideas to make the loot pool a fun chase for us as players, especially with the loot resets that are due to take place in the future! :D",2,1585501318,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr946i/perk_suggestions/,DestinyTheGame,2
fr93vn,teach49,Trials needs to be obnoxiously rewarding,"If Bungie wants this game mode to really be a hit it needs a reward shift.  Normal rewards (weapons, armor) should be dropping like candy.  After matches, from bounties and of course at 3/5/7.

Flawless rewards need to be different and the majority of people need to understand that going flawless is not something that is going to happen very easily.

fr93tx,CommanderM2192,Future Destiny 2 content needs to be put on hold until critical fixes are made,"I love the Destiny franchise, I've been here since right before VoG opened up, I put over 3K hours into D1, blah, blah, blah blah blah...

I could write some kind, open letter to Bungie. I could list all the issues with Destiny and rank them by seriousness. But that's been done before and there's a single, root problem that needs to be addressed.

It's time to delay all future D2 content until all critical issues have been fixed. These fixes must be communicated with the community and their feedback taken into account.

It's at the point where there is no excuse for Bungie to not do this. As someone who's worked in software engineering, architecture, and product management it's something that has to be done. If I treated ANY of my customers the way Bungie treats me and everyone else here they would no longer be my customer. That's why I didn't buy Season of the Worthy. That's why I didn't even bother updating D2 to play my beloved Trials.

If you want my business again as a customer stop with the bullshit about not being able to implement fixes in time for content and actually fix Destiny now. Don't wait until Destiny 3 to make half of your ""fixes"". You aren't with Activision anymore, you can set your own schedule. If you are in a spot where you cannot delay a season to make critical fixes/changes due to financial reasons... then where has all the money gone? Why aren't you communicating this?

The important thing right now is that you guys step up, communicate what is actually going on, and delay the next content until you have fixed the critical issues.

I have personally been in a situation in my career where I had to do this with a big customer. They didn't care about whose fault it was. All they cared about was that the product sales and marketing had promised wasn't doing what they had promised and wasn't meeting their personal expectations. We delayed delivering on the next milestone (i.e. content drop) until the issues were all resolved. I worked my ass off, communicated how we were going to fix this, made the customer happy, and they continued being a customer.

You are doing the exact opposite.

In half seriousness, send me a DM if you really think it's impossible for you to turn this around. I offer consulting services.",37,1585501286,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr93tx/future_destiny_2_content_needs_to_be_put_on_hold/,DestinyTheGame,0

fr8nq4,Nerkson,I think Warmind Cells are one of Bungies best ideas so far.,"When looking at this season, I think Warmind Cells will be remembered very fondly, and I'm truly sad they're going to rotate. 

They're one of Bungies best ideas to promote build diversity and they're so simple as well. 

You want warmind cells? Well the 7th Seraph weapons spawn them on kills, which  means you can use any elemental affinity class! Or you could go arc subclasses and spawn them super consistently, and then use any weapons you want! Heck theres even a mod that makes them spawn from exploding other warmind cells!

What do you want the Cells to do? Want them to explode with the fury of a golden sun? No problem! Want them to disrupt and dampen champs? Can-do! Heal allies? Even that, yes! Debuff enemies and weaken them? As if you had to ask. 

Don't want to shoot them? Theres mods that make them do things when you pick 'em up, and you can even chuck 'em around to do other things! Spawn Arc lightning, increase your melee regen speed, it's all here.

My only 'complaints' are that allies can shoot my Cells, and if they don't have the right mods it won't do what I'm intending. 

If Bungie added this to the base game, I'm sure people wouldn't mind.",129,1585499692,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr8nq4/i_think_warmind_cells_are_one_of_bungies_best/,DestinyTheGame,1

Instead of giving us something nice, Bungie decides to bring back trials.

I like to see exotic quests as the Daedric Artifacts from Skyrim. Those were awesome. You get something that can clear through a wave of draugr and waste bosses. These quests weren't easy either. That's exactly what whisper/zero hour/spindle were like. Sure you had to bash through a couple of things but the reward was worth it.

fr80fy,MMMartin427,Use Light level adjustments and incentives to make Trials competitive.,"Like many of you here, I spent hours on Trials since it came back. I'm not going to get into stats, but I would think that I'm average to above average at Destiny PVP. This weekend, I'm struggling to get to 3 wins with my team. We are getting matched with some really skilled players, who in many cases are so far beyond our stats and skill level that it feels like we are playing a different game. This is not at the 6 win point, where the deciding match would take us to the lighthouse - this is our first or second game on a card. 

I have a suggestion that I think could even the playing field a little for lower skilled players to have a chance, and for higher skilled players to have a challenge and reward that would be worth it. 

1. For each flawless card completion, your Light level drops by 10 (or whatever fair number) for all subsequent trials matches. 
2. For each flawless card completion, the rewards you get for a flawless run increase. Not just ""more trials weapons"" but add in let's say a guaranteed exotic, ascendant shards etc. Make the rewards really worth it. 
3. Leaderboard for most wins at the lowest combined light as a team - special emblems with exclusive trackers. 
4. This resets weekly.

Benefits - It does not split the playerbase like the suggestions that flawless players only play each other. It maintains competition and challenge, gives lower skilled players a chance. 

This is version 1.  I would love your feedback. Let me know what you guys think.",2,1585497347,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr80fy/use_light_level_adjustments_and_incentives_to/,DestinyTheGame,1
fr7zv6,Tucker_Design,"Champion Mods on Exotics, a middle ground","So, this is something we all see come up a lot. In my opinion, Bungie does see this, but worries it would trivialise champion difficulty. Whether or not that’s true though, I can see issues with certain special and heavy weapons having these mods. 

So here is my personal 2 part solution for Champion mods on exotics;

**1.) Champion mods are only applicable to primaries.**

**2.) Champion mods are only applied after an exotic is masterworked.**

1.) Barring the already equipped exotics, this would mean that champion stuns were still within a form of challenge. I worry that certain specials or heavies with a champion mod equipped would eliminate the challenge of facing these combatants. But, with the nature of primary weapons, the benefits are less severe. This gives you the option of choosing a versatile champion exotic primary or a utility heave or special exotic. 

2.) This in itself has a series of benefits I can see.

• Attaching these mods to Catalysts means you actively have to invest into an Exotic you want to use during champion activities. 

• New catalysts could be attached to old content to make it relevant to those weapons. You want an Anti Barrier wish-ender? You have to defeat bosses I’m Shattered Throne to earn the catalyst. Unstoppable Thorn? Defeat Hive in Crown of Sorrow. People want a reason to invest in old content, this isn’t a perfect solution but it’s a small band-aid that creates a brief demand. 

• Veteran players with catalysts already completed on exotics feel rewarded for having already obtained them, but newer players have incentives to peruse upgrades that will introduce them to endgame content. 

-

I could go on about the minor details that I like about my idea. But I guess I want to make a ‘closing statement’. So, this sub has recently been inundated with rants and frustration. We all have different opinions, but honestly I do understand some of the building angst. But it’s not the solution. One thing is clear, we all want the game to be better. So, let’s try and help with that. Do I think holding Bungie’s feet to the fire will do that? Maybe. But there’s only so much accountability someone can take before it becomes exhausting. So, let’s try and suggest some solutions too. Do I think that this post will make its way into the game? No, probably not. But, I have faith in the idea that solutions, ideas and problem solving have a far greater opportunity to galvanise the developers and push this game forward. 

Anyway, please discuss in the comments. I look forward to seeing what people say.

Just last week, on Anomaly, I went on a huge loss streak, so much so I stopped counting after 24 losses. My friends and I were talking about this when we came up with a *possible* solution: get rid of the tokens, keep the rewards on wins, and have losing a match get you a small chance(say about ~5%) at getting a piece of that week’s loot, and winning give you a larger chance(~15%) at getting one, that way the sweats grinding out god rolls can throw if they want and people who want flawless loot can try and win. Obviously this idea would need a lot of refining, but I’m also interested in hearing the ideas of other people who feel the same.

fr7pfd,floridagator1995,"While the community cannibalizes itself, let's not forget it's up to Bungie to fix ToO.","It's easy math Guardian: Trials needs loot worth going after for both casual and hardcore players.  So let's see if Bungie has delivered the goods. 

Casual players: no Token turn-in unless you reach 3 wins, no post-game drops, no bounties that directly reward loot. Not looking good so far for people unable to reach those 3 wins, and even if they do, you're still looking at 7 losses with the Passage of Wealth in order to get 1 drop. Seems pretty discouraging. 

Hardcore players: no Adept weapons, no unique armor, just a Glow and some masterwork materials that can be more easily obtained from Nightfalls. For some the Glow is worth it, for others (and I'd say most people) it's not. 

In many ways, it seems Bungie has sort of half-baked the experience for these 2 groups of people. Yeah you can get unique stuff from the Lighthouse that others cannot get, but is it worth it? Yeah you can technically lose every single game infinitely and get rewards, but is it worth it? The answer to both questions is no.

fr7oln,nitrousoxidefart,"If you're not planning to fundamentally change how Eververse works, at least adjust the pricing","Let's use this week's offerings as an example:


Exotic Ghost - **2850 BD**
Exotic Armor Ornament - **1950 BD**
Exotic Weapon Ornament - **1250 BD**
Universal Armor Ornament - **1200 BD**
Legendary Multiplayer Emote - **1250 BD**
Ghost Projection - **1500 BD**
Transmat Effect - **450 BD**
Exotic Sparrow - **2500 BD**


I need to point out that I'm not here to discuss how the prices are unfair or how earning BD needs to change for the better. That's a well known fact and something that gets repeated here daily with no changes for our benefit in sight. So, with that in mind, let's just say that the **~1200 BD** price range seems ""fair"" most of the items sold under that category. 


Exotic Armor Ornaments being a tad bit more expensive than their Legendary counterparts is okay with me given their status. What I'm *not* okay with is shelling out almost **3000 BD** for a Ghost *and then* half of that price again for a Ghost Projection. These two items are ridiculously overpriced, not just compared to the other more useful/visible items in the store, but on their own as well.

You are paying **4250 BD** for a Ghost and a Projection to go with it. This is more BD than it's even possible to earn per week even if you grind it out on all 3 characters - provided you even have/play them. That little pixel smudge that you're only ever going to see in your inventory and the projection that you're *almost never* going to see cost more than Weapon and Armor Ornaments that you'll use and reuse daily. There is no reason an Exotic Ghost should cost more than **1000 BD** or that projections should cost more than **200-500 BD** depending on how detailed they are. 

I don't want people to think I'm advocating for making Shaders more expensive, cause I'm not, but those darn things cost *only* **40 BD**. There's not a single person who can't afford those and they are arguably your most used/reused Eververse items. So, why does a borderline useless Ghost-Projection combo cost more than **100x** the price of a shader? Another comparison is Transmat Effects. They're neat, unique and usually stand out. What do they have in common with Shaders? They're properly priced for what they do.



Other items that need pricing adjustment are Exotic Emotes (almost 3x the price of their Legendary counterparts at **3250 BD*) and Ships and Sparrows. Unless you *really* like to visit planetary destinations daily, you really won't get that much use out of your Sparrow other than having a neat (if sometimes distracting) decoration in your inventory. There's not that much to be said about Ships, but **2000 BD** is pushing it for me considering you're essentially buying a customized loading screen since Ships have no other purpose.",167,1585496074,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr7oln/if_youre_not_planning_to_fundamentally_change_how/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr7jek,Apollo-Loyal-to-None,"Bungie, 10% is not enough.","I know that raid exotics are supposed to be an extremely rare item but I don’t think it should be tied up with a 10% drop chance that you can only try to do 3 times a week. So far I am 67 clears deep in Scourge of the Past with no Anarchy and I just become more and more disheartened when somebody with less than 10 clears gets it. I have got/done everything I want from the raid. Threat Level, Always on Time Sparrow, Like a Diamond and all the challenges. I have everything but Anarchy which is one of the main reasons to still run the raid to this day. To make things worse is that I can only try the raid three times and I have to wait till next week to *try to get it*. 

Bungie, can we please give raids the Nightfall treatment? Just please give raid exotics drop protection. I don’t care that much how much percent you get per non-exotic run, but I would go with 1-2% per run. That way, I can at least say “I’ll have better luck next time.” and I actually will have better luck instead of saying it to make myself go do another run if I can actually do another one that week.

Another solution would be to tie the raid exotic with a flawless run. That way, the people who prefer to not do flawless can keep running the raid, week after week, to try to get it. While the extremely hardcore players would just run it flawless so they have guaranteed chance of getting it. That way it rewards those who take up the challenge while the people who still have a bunch of time on their hands but are not so skilled can still have something to work for. Also, if Bungie actually does this then the people who already went flawless should have it guaranteed on their next run of the raid. 

Personally, I would implement both systems. I am pitied upon by my friends (and I can’t blame them, I would too) and the repeated runs of the raid makes me loathe scourge of the past, even though it is probably the most fun raid Bungie has released. I don’t want to see another person like me with 50+ clears and still doesn’t have the raid exotic. However, I also think that hardcore players should be rewarded more than a 300 point triumph that is also required for (most) raid titles. Bungie, if you actually are reading this and if you are planning to implement a system similar to this, then give people who have already run the raid the drop protection they would have based on the number of clears they have. Also, guarantee the raid exotic on the next run of the raid for people who already did it flawless.

tl:dr: Implement Drop protection system in raids and guarantee exotic on flawless raids. 

P.S. : Plz give Enlightened its flawless requirement back. The flawless was about 1/2 the difficulty of the seal.",5,1585495507,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr7jek/bungie_10_is_not_enough/,DestinyTheGame,1
fr7ini,BitterlySarcastic,A simple solution to old raid incentive.,"Currently, there is little reward or incentive to do any raid besides Garden for pinnacle drops. Raids reward so little XP that you can level up 2-3 times from moon bounties in the time it would take to run a raid. 

Simultaneously, playlist strikes are in a weird place where no one wants to run them once you're past the powerful drop light level. They're propped up by people running them for bounties. Bounties are going to continue to be the core of the game until at least next season is over, as irritating as that is.

Raids are a vanguard operation--they're under the vanguard tab on the triumph screen. Why not add raid bounties? I would love a weekly bounty to complete 2-3 raids with a big XP and bright dust reward. Hawthorne's challenge bounties give an extra raid drop, perhaps vanguard ones could get that too? Maybe daily bounties to open raid chests, complete X number of raid encounters, or to sherpa someone through their first clear? 

I'd love to get as much XP for a last wish clear as you can for one strike with a handful of bounties, and I'm sure the rest of you would too.",1,1585495428,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr7ini/a_simple_solution_to_old_raid_incentive/,DestinyTheGame,1
fr7hkr,seansandakn,"Bungie, please let me put my legendary ornaments on exotic armor pieces.","Title says it all, but I'll try to explain more in depth.

Yes, I am a new light, but things like this still annoy me a lot. I started getting into the game in Season of Dawn (which was alright), and something that annoyed me to no end was not being able to put the seasonal ornaments on my Celestial Nighthawk. Exotic armor pieces are a requirement in endgame content, and make non-endgame content so much easier. If they're such an integral part of the game, and Bungie knows this, why can't I put my ornaments on them?

Now, I'm not sure if this only affects Year 1 and Year 2 exotics, because I haven't really used a year 3 exotic at all. I'm honestly kind of lucky that I'm annoyed at not being able to put it on a helmet. Not being able to put them on helmets is bearable, but if I was using Stomp-EE5, Orpheus Rig, or some exotic chestpiece, I would be even more pissed. The chest and legs is the main focus of the armor piece, and not being able to customize that would basically ruin the ornament set.

Since it’s change Hardlight is number 1 in kills in the crucible and has more kills than the 2nd place and 3rd place weapons combined- and almost as much as the 2nd, 3rd and 4th combined.  IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST GAPS IN THE HISTORY OF DESTINY.

-It’s 0 zero damage fall off, 100 stability, 100 recoil direction, 100 aim assist stats, generous 49 round mag, fast reload, membership to the current top tier adaptive frame archetype and double damage ricochet rounds all coupled with the recent buff to auto rifles (which I don’t want reversed) have allowed it to fit in any play style from aggressive rushing to finishing off guys body shot with a sniper.
These numbers make every legendary auto exclusively inferior at the outset

-As for revoker, combined with its excellent stats and zoom, ice breaker lite has become even worse now in trials.

fr7332,Prince_Nocturne,A proposed fix for Trails.,"What if Trails counted how many times one reset their card each week. And depending on how many times they’ve reset their card, the matchmaking system would slowly start to shift from card-based matchmaking to skill-based matchmaking. More resets would equal more lean into skill-based matchmaking. This counter would reset each week.

This way, the people who’d like the proper Trails “experience” can have it even for a few resets in, and people who’d like to farm can do so, facing opponents at their own skill level.

I’m no developer, but I’m just throwing this out there as an idea if anyone at Bungie happens to read it.",4,1585493747,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr7332/a_proposed_fix_for_trails/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr6ymw,EKmars,Weapon sundowning will effectively remove weapons from all kinds of the content due to the fact all of the meaningfully rewarding/grindable content is high LL.,"So Bungie has been talking about making old weapons not upgradeable. Now, some streamers, who don't understand normal people who play this game, have been saying you'll get to keep your loot for the rest of the game's content.   


Except, what content would that be? They mean to say you don't have your gear for the newer, more exciting endgame content, but there is a huge problem with that. Everything we do now that is worth a reward is   


Strikes have light levels in Ordeals that determine how many upgrade materials you gain. If you don't have the appropriate light level, you will very often just get squished like a bug. There is a pretty big gulf, based on what light level you're on, between the value of the rewards of 1 to 100 enhancement core's worth of materials, not to mention the glimmer, shards, and planetary materials it can cost to level one kind of mat into another.   


Gambit has Light Level enabled for the PvP component. If you don't have the highest light level, you get squashed pretty quick while invade or are being invaded. This can determine whether you win or lose a match.   


Crucible has a 2 modes with light level enabled. I understand Trials being a perpetually hardcore endgame mode, but Iron Banner is a pretty relaxing mode if you ask me. IB isn't really incentivizing people play any way outside of the LL, but it is an important part of the pinnacle grind. However, to get Pinnacles from Iron Banner requires you to play with specific weapons currently. If you wanted to use something specific to grind that out, you're at a pretty severe disadvantage against your peers.   


Seasonal, expansion, or other forms of new content are also a problem. When you start, the new content is a higher level than you a lot of the time. If you can't infuse your old gear, you can't play any of that new content with your old gear for much of the same reasons above. It can be argued that this is the sort of content you should be limited on for the kinds of equipment you can bring, but a bulk of this isn't even the end game. You'll be grinding a lot of the time here for whatever bits/weaponframes/materials/tokens the new content demands, meaning you won't be able to use your old gear.  


So, in summary, I will say that rather than a majority of the game will be playable with your older gear, a majority will be unplayable unless a majority of the games systems and how they approach light level is changed.",44,1585493242,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr6ymw/weapon_sundowning_will_effectively_remove_weapons/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr6th4,ThyySavage,Bungie should bring back Record Books like they had in Rise of Iron,"The Record Book system back in Rise of Iron felt like one of the better reward systems in my opinion. Getting rewarded physically and cosmetically for running activities, hunting for secrets and running pinnacle activities made the record book system great. It gave more incentive to actually play the game even just casually, unlike now where if youre not a sweat or spend extra money youre locked out of a good part of the loot pool. It gave more players incentive to run activities that werent as popular and do things that not as many players would normally do.

We may have the season pass where we get rewards for leveling up but wheres the fun is mindlessly grinding Exp and bounties to rush it to completion to get the same pair of gauntlets for a 3rd time that look like garbage (The Titan armor this season looks like the love child between a melon and one of those weird spiky and rigid christmas ornaments, and it's ugly as hell, why would I want to grind for that or earn it for that matter)? We may have the triumph page/book but that could be kept seperate. Not to mention the record book could be something you get for purchasing a dlc/season acsess and easily be carried over across seasons so you never miss the chance to get those cool cosmetics and you can grind them out whenever you please. Sure not all the records will be easy to get but they could easily be made so you dont need to go flawless 5 times and run raids flawlessly to earn certain sets of armor and cosmetics.

They could eveen make a record book specifically for Tirals. Earn x amount of kills, complete x amount of bounties, earn x amount of rewards packages from Saint 14, etc. It's that simple, everyone will have ease of acsess to the rewards, but some may just earn them slower than others.",2,1585492645,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr6th4/bungie_should_bring_back_record_books_like_they/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr6qii,i_forget_what_i_do,Can we get Prestige Titles for added achievements ?,"Titles have been a fantastic inclusion into the game allowing players to have a specific cosmetic goal to grind for.  Many Titles were added in Forsaken, however a few of them are for evergreen activities, things that will *always* be relevant regardless of Season.  Two that come to mind are both Unbroken and Chronicler.  For Chronicler all you need to do is collect the lore from the Forsaken campaign.  There's a *lot* of it and it's certainly not easier, but there has been a lot more added since.  My thoughts were for a Prestige rank for every year of the game: a rank for the Forsaken lore from Black Armory, Joker's Wild, and Penumbra; and a rank for the Shadowkeep lore from Season 8 all the way through 11.  It would be nice to have yearly Prestige additions to titles that keep adding more and more content, maybe changing up the color of the name plate or adding certain designs to denote a player's achievements.  For Unbroken it could include having gone Flawless in Trials on every map with every class and reaching Legend in 7 different Seasons rather than 3.  I'm certainly not the greatest PvP'er but I'm one more Season away from reaching Unbroken myself.  I don't see myself repping the title as I'm not at a skill level where I feel comfortable doing that, but I know there are plenty of players who have gotten to Legend in every Season since Forsaken and that would certainly be a badass way to show it off.

I'm sure there are other possible Prestige Titles, but these are just the two that I can think of.",0,1585492325,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr6qii/can_we_get_prestige_titles_for_added_achievements/,DestinyTheGame,1

I made the switch to PC just because of the faster FPS. The faster loading of menus is just the side bonus. If I could, I would go back to console if it would have 60 FPS there.

 This season is drier than the food served on hells kitchen. Begining of the season we got a public event, a room to kill stuff in daily, harder lost sectors and bounties. 3 days later trials is out wich is not the main focus of the season according to bungie. After trials we get a exotic quest 4th horseman a gun from destiny 1 or a massive bounty since thats bassically the quest ""kill X enemy on X planet"" over and over then go do a lost sector wich is only hard if you're under leveled.
Quite sometime passes and we get the 2nd bunker on the moon. What does it have? A couple of mods and the same reward system no new guns no armor just ana typing on a computer in the begining then us breast feeding rasputin warmind bits for upgrades that didnt change at all from the previouse edz bunker. I also would like to add the fact that trials is ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
You know what i HATE the MOST about this season? The fact that the entire siva theory is backed up by eververse ffs. Now you can claim the argument of them working on their new ip or year 4 but if thats the case these 2 better be worth the godamn time since if they are terrible and caused a season as terrible as this one ill be pissed. For the low low price of 10 dollars i could buy alot of things worth more than a public event and ctrl+c ctrl+v content.

•So should content be only for hardcore players? Hell no wanna make content for hardcore players go for it wanna make for casual players go for it but bounty farming is not fun esspecially when the activities im doing are based on the bounties i still didnt do.

•Should all content be new? No but a public event bounties and low effort copy paste isnt exactly worth the 10 dollars you ask for.

Before anyone says: ""it quarntine they all are working from home"" keep in mind good friend that the content your gonna play next week isnt being developed right now but infact was developed awhile ago so this was made way before the pandemic spread.

I’ve looked everywhere online and I’m not sure if this was intentional or not to keep it balanced but if so I’d like to know. Because when playing it is frustrating knowing that I have to die to make my charged melee kills give me super energy back.

2: heck, while we’re at it, any armour we have in our collection should unlock an ornament.

3: Ghosts 2.0. Shells largely cosmetic with mods. Maybe exotics have more perk slots than legendary

Maybe the raid but at this point I’ve done it over 50 times which is about the extent of a typical raid in destiny entertains me. Destiny needs something new, we don’t need a really shitty worse version of escalation protocol. I think we need a new raid, or to overhaul our pinnacle drops. Everyone’s been in quarantine and playing video games bored and shit but my god I just can’t touch destiny rn it feels so boring. I’ll always log on and just stare at the orbit screen and I can’t think of anything that’s fun I want to do in the game.

fr5i0y,CommanderM2192,The ONE thing Bungie needs to do with Destiny,"I love the Destiny franchise, I've been here since right before VoG opened up, I put over 3K hours into D1, blah, blah, blah blah blah...

I could write some kind, open letter to Bungie. I could list all the issues with Destiny and rank them by seriousness. But that's been done before and there's a single, root problem that needs to be addressed.

It's time to delay all future D2 content until all critical issues have been fixed. These fixes must be communicated with the community and their feedback taken into account.

It's at the point where there is no excuse for Bungie to not do this. As someone who's worked in software engineering, architecture, and product management it's something that has to be done. If I treated ANY of my customers the way Bungie treats me and everyone else here they would no longer be my customer. That's why I didn't buy Season of the Worthy. That's why I didn't even bother updating D2 to play my beloved Trials.

If you want my business again as a customer stop with the bullshit about not being able to implement fixes in time for content and actually fix Destiny now. Don't wait until Destiny 3 to make half of your ""fixes"". You aren't with Activision anymore, you can set your own schedule. If you are in a spot where you cannot delay a season to make critical fixes/changes due to financial reasons... then where has all the money gone? Why aren't you communicating this?

The important thing right now is that you guys step up, communicate what is actually going on, and delay the next content until you have fixed the critical issues.

I have personally been in a situation in my career where I had to do this with a big customer. They didn't care about whose fault it was. All they cared about was that the product sales and marketing had promised wasn't doing what they had promised and wasn't meeting their personal expectations. We delayed delivering on the next milestone (i.e. content drop) until the issues were all resolved. I worked my ass off, communicated how we were going to fix this, made the customer happy, and they continued being a customer.

You are doing the exact opposite.

In half seriousness, send me a DM if you really think it's impossible for you to turn this around. I offer consulting services.",20,1585486642,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr5i0y/the_one_thing_bungie_needs_to_do_with_destiny/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr585d,PinoShow,Using DIM's loadout optimize feature to refine your loadout,"Something I always notice when I'm inspecting the enemy team in high stakes PvP matches is that not many people pay much attention to their stats and armour perks. It often happens with both teammates and enemy team, so I thought I'd explain how to better optimize your armour sets for PvP.

This will obviously work for PvE aswell, but you'll notice the difference way more in PvP.

To begin with, I'm Italian, so english isn't my first language.

I'm a console player, Unbroken, and have gone flawless multiple times in the last 3 weeks.  
I know it's not a big deal to some, but I'm highly invested into PvP even if I'm not a streamer or someone who does recovs / carries 24/7.

I'd say I'm above average, I end most of my games with a positive KD and in high stakes PvP I focus more on winning the match than on padding my stats.  
Here are my stats if you're curious:

 [https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/xbl/Pino%20Show/overview) 

&amp;#x200B;

So, to get to the topic of my post: if you open Destiny Item Manager and log in your account you'll notice that there's an option called [Loadout Optimizer](https://imgur.com/a/GofCacU). 

Clicking on it will bring you to [this page](https://imgur.com/a/5GYYYTS). Here you can look through your characters, and DIM will do it's best to show you the best armour combinations to reach the highest ammount of stats possible.

This won't take into account the mods you have on your armour. This is extremely important. You'll only see the stats that your gear has by default. If an armour piece is masterworked then the +2 to all stats will be counted into the total splits.

As you can see my warlock has a set with a T31 split, meaning I have 31 stats point. As in game every 1 point is one level in one of the stats.

I'd recommend to also check the box labelled as Assume Masterworked. This will show you all your best items. It's especially useful if you need to decide what to masterwork next.

&amp;#x200B;

We're not done yet. On the ""drag items here to lock"" you can select an existing piece of armour to lock, and DIM will show you all the best items to go with it. This is especially useful to build around exotic armour, as you'd probably have better stats splitted legendary armour, meaning many exotics might not show up in your highest tier builds.

&amp;#x200B;

With a loadout selected we can no go to the next step: stat mods!  
These are what you'll use to min max your stats. 

Some are of course more desirable than others: Recovery, Intellect and Discipline especially.  
Here's where you'll have to make your choices. What stats do you think are most important to you? What build are you using?  


Arc web warlocks will want as much discipline as possible.  
Dragon's shadow hunters will be happy with 50 mobility, so they can spec eerywhere else.  
A Kepri's Sting build might want more strength than others.

Don't forget about the Powerful Friends mod from Season of Dawn for a 20+ mobility when paired with another arc mod (and it's glitched status ;) ).

&amp;#x200B;

After that it's time to focus on the other 2 important aspects: elemental affinity and mods. These go hand in hand and it's really up to you. Being able to change the element on the armour means that you can now make your best pieces the element you want.

Depending on your weapon of choice you'll need to go with an element. General mods usually aren't worth it that much. I'm saing usually becasue there's one that's better than all of them in my opinion: Special Weapon Scavenger. This is a boots mod that allows you to keep the same pair of boots regardless of special weapon. 

It's a 4 cost mod though, meaning that if you also are addicted to Traction (like me), you will be pidgeon holed in a 3 cost mod for your boots, *and that's only if you masterwork them!*  


After that targeting mods on helmets, reload on gauntlets and unflinching on chest are what you'll be looking for after. Remember to take a look at the seasonal mods aswell, since they're tipeless and usually cost less than their normal counterparts. Though relying on them too much might prove problematic at the end of the season.

I'd recommed making your class item arc to have the powerful friends mod. Paired with an arc mod will leave you with 4/5 free points left depending on the chosen mod and masterwork, so you can have either more intellect or recovery almost for free. And have a 42 stats class item instead of the usual 22.

Armour wise the Premium season pass' last pieces have really really high rolls. The warlock ones this season are really well splitted with high recovery and intellect.

&amp;#x200B;

This is pretty much it. Hope you found this post useful. It might seem not that important at first, but getting your super 10 seconds earlier might make a difference in that high intensity Trials match.   
Or your grenade coming up right before the zone spawns in overtime.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though this quote from a recent IGN article encapsulates the strangeness we feel when we play the game full of bugs, disconnects and defective exotics.

With two out of three new exotics needing to be taken offline for fixes to problems that seemed absurd to us initially, I suppose it's important to understand the real-world context to which this season has released into. 

Sure, season 10 must've been slimmed down to begin with before the COVID-19 explosion, it's clear we're lacking substance across the board, but Bungie's necessary reaction to the coronavirus has obviously exacerbated things.

All good things for us to keep in mind moving forward.

fr3xc3,FederalWeezy,A discussion about Cerberus +1,"Cerberus 1 is one of my favorite weapons in D2, it's the definition of simple crazy fun. This is also specifically talking about pvp by the way.

In terms of mechanics, Cerberus 1 is very creative and simple. The gun fires 4 bullets with each shot, with 3 of them having a random shotgun-like spread. However the 4th shot is the most important as it works exactly as a normal auto rifle, essentially shooting exactly where you point. Because of its four barrels, this gun iirc has the highest auto rifle dps in the game, with the cost being that it lacks reliability. The 4th, straight shooting barrel still gives it an element of reliability allowing you to (with good accuracy) consistently get crits. Overall the mechanics of the Cerberus 1 give it a unique personality that I love, with a possibility for insane ttks if you play your cards right while keeping a strong sense of consistency. There have been very few times where I felt as though the gun's rng made me lose a gunfight, or that I could've won if the gun had landed more bullets.

Next the lore, which is fucking insane. Cerberus 1 is an electronic BB gun on a week long cocaine binge. Iirc, the gun gets its power from a one of a kind battery. A battery so strong that it can fire four guns duct taped together. Imagine Frankenstein's monster, but a gun, that is, in essence Cerberus 1's vibe.

The gun might not be the strongest in competitive, but it can fucking dominate in casual lobbies. It's extra punishing to shotgun rushers because the closer they get, the more damage they take causing a worst case scenario to be a trade in most situations. It is reliable enough for me to get 20+ kills in casual games so clearly it's not entirely random. I like it to black jack, where you can get fucked over by bad luck, but luck ultimately takes a backseat to skill in most games. 

I really want to hear your opinions on Cerberus+1 because i seldom see other players using it. Am I lucky? Or stupid? I wanna know.",11,1585478044,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr3xc3/a_discussion_about_cerberus_1/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr3sw3,RendPrime,EvErVeRsE bAd ReMoVe TeSs,"I'm getting a little sick of every few weeks a new ""Eververse is bad"" post being made and getting a shit load of upvotes and being one of the most popular posts on the sub at the time. (This is Hyperbole)

Look, I know we wanna earn this stuff ingame. I do too, especially with Coronavirus jacking everyone's income right now. I remember the days of earning these cosmetics. But that was a different time. And these items are PURELY COSMETIC. Look at most other games that offer cosmetic items or skins. They're paid for. They have absolutely no effect on gameplay.

PLEASE remember; base Destiny is a free to play game now. As well as Bungie no longer has the backing of Activision. They need to make money somehow and not every single blueberry is buying Shadowkeep. I know content trickle kinda sucks and we're not super fast to get some things but give Bungie time. Remember that Console and PC are on the same patches and Bungie has to run these patches by Microsoft and Sony as well.

I'm not sucking Bungie off here, a lot of things are overpriced if you ask me and they certainly screw up. For example they need to make activities gives more season pass xp. But people need to try seeing things from Bungie's perspective and have some sense of empathy.

Oh and about the ""Eververse gets updated with new items constantly but we dont have anything to do, theres no content."" Bullshit. Theres plenty of content in Destiny, from MULTIPLE raids, to crucible, Gambit, Forges, Strikes, Menagerie, Trials, Public Events, Bunkers, and so on. If you dont want to do any of those things that is YOUR problem. Not Bungie's. Oh and each new season is coming with FREE NEW CONTENT. Quit your whining

If I remember correctly Bungie stated that there was some sort of bug regarding the Service Revolver ( the last vanguard weapon) and that all the vendor curated rolls would be disabled until they fixed the issue. Since then these curated weapons have been MIA for approximately 3-4 seasons now. 

For me the biggest issue is the Gambit curated rolls as the only way to get these rolls were from this system of buying them from Drifter each season. 

I don't believe this should be the biggest of issues as all of these rolls are already in the database as can be seen through light.gg.

fr3dal,Aniconic_TOP,"For what, though?","Dear Bungie and community,

Here I am, lying in bed at 5:30 in the morning, not being able to sleep after grinding my favorite game all day. I can't stop thinking about getting up tomorrow morning to hop on again with all of my friends and grind some more. But, for what? What are we grinding for? I get on, play for hours, do bounties, get powerful gear, get pinnacle gear... and then what? 

The game is at a standstill. Trials is fun and competitive but it feels like the only reason anybody wants to play it is to farm tokens, just like everything else. Raids are currently pointless unless it's Garden of Salvation and even then all you're playing for is a chance at getting a couple power increase on one piece of your gear. Iron banner is back and has more ""content"" but currently feels like a chore, with a quest that forces you to use weapons that you're not comfortable with or simply don't want to use. I digress.

I don't want to complain about my favorite game. I love it. I continue to constantly want to grind. But it's come to a point where I feel like I'm grinding for the sake of grinding. To get what my friends have. To reach maximum power. And is that the point? Is that all there is to the game? I don't think so, but I've lost track of what used to make me come back to the game. The exciting story, the amazing raids and endgame content, the LORE by God the lore... 

It's been a while since Bungie has hit a home run. I think Forsaken was a big step in the right direction with story and keeping people engaged without feeling like a chore. I just hope they can do it again soon. There's a lot to do in the game, and (I'm pretty sure) the game itself is fun, but I've felt lost in the reason why I keep getting on to play every day over the course of the past few weeks.

Has the player pool really reached such a low number already that there are no other teams on their last win to play against?

fr27hd,_datboimatty_,Trials went from euphoric to defeating in a matter of 2 weeks...,"I’ll put it in perspective. I’m not a top tier crucible player but I’ve gotten pretty good over my time on D2. I went from a .57 in comp and Trials of the Nine to soloing my way to the crucible pinnacles in their respective seasons and raising my KD from the depths up to .94/ 1.52 KAD  (nothing special but was extremely difficult considering where I was). I enjoy comp now because I can actually see how I’ve gotten drastically better.

Now let’s get to trials. 

Week 1 - was amazing...went flawless 2x (first times ever in destiny) and came close at 6 wins several other cards.

Week 2 - there was a lot more talented players in the lower card games but still pulled off a legit 7-0 card off some great wins with my team. Also, getting to 5/6 wins wasn’t too brutal but definitely more difficult. 

Week 3 - I’m defeated 2 days in. Highest this week was 5 wins (extremely hard fought ones). Most cards end at 2-3 wins as me and my team are facing unbrokens and extremely high skilled players. Every game feels like game 7 from previous weeks often times going 4-4. Even if I get the card this week I’d have to ask myself...was it skill, or did we get lucky on the card? 

I understand why this is happening as there’s no flawless incentive so why would the skilled players stay in the high cards when the rewards are all the same after they’re earned once. I just write this to say that if it continues this way there will be no point to continue as the enjoyment is stripped. It will only get worse for the playlist too as it’s going to continue to crush the skill gap to where players who feel great this week will experience more and more brutally hard cards as the weeks go on.

fr1pge,Vat-o-Spaghetti,Spitballing - My Ideas For a Trials Rework,"Howdy folks,

I've been enjoying trials so far *\*gasp\** but I think the problems with the playlist are unavoidable at this point. Card-based matchmaking has incentivized win farming at the beginning of cards for tokens, and it's putting a damper on the number of people who feel the playlist is accessible - myself included.

I'm no expert on how this stuff works, so input is welcome and appreciated, but during a bit of a discussion with some of my clanmates I think I may have a method to help address some of the issues people seem to be having with the playlist, so I hope you'll give this a read.

# MATCHMAKING

Card-based matchmaking has been an unmitigated disaster so far. New players are locked out of the playlist by teams playing far below their probable skill level in the first few wins of the card, and even experienced players and teams sometimes find themselves stuck on that first game. I know, in my experience last weekend alone, of the maybe 20-odd games that I lost over the course of attempting to go Flawless, maybe 15 were in the very first game. The times we managed to get through that first game, it was ridiculously fast to burn through the next 3-4 wins, it felt like things let up (admittedly, anecdotal evidence - would love to hear the experiences of others).

However, it's also important to remember that Trials is fundamentally about the card, about chasing flawless, and not about increasing a rank like competitive. Keeping this in mind, how can we balance the integrity of the playlist and the Trials experience with the needs of the wider population, who don't want a sweatfest on the first game of their new card?

**STREAK-BASED MATCHMAKING?**

Instead of matching people based on their card status, maybe look at their recent win/loss history or streaks? If you can match the farmers against eachother at those lower points in the card since they're farming and resetting, eventually they will either A: separate themselves from those who are just starting out or B: give up and realize they might as well just continue their card instead of sticking around the start and resetting over and over. Alternatively, you could look at the win/loss record for the last 6 or so matches, helping to both contain matchmaking to that card alone when in the later stages of the card. 

So what about the people who just finished flawless and are starting a new card? This could present issues as they already have an existing win streak when hopping into the playlist for a new card, and they are looking to get the rewards for a new card and shouldn't expect the same burden of difficulty they had hunting for win #7. In this case, it might be appropriate to reward a reset of a flawless or completed card with a reduction in their win streak rating or win/loss history as far as matchmaking is concerned. For example, a team completing their flawless can reset their card and enter the first game with a ranking considered by MM to be that of a team with 3-5 wins on their card, instead of one of a team on a 7 win streak. A team resetting from a card with 7 wins and a loss could be matched alongside teams with 2-4 wins on their card, so on and so forth. This could help balance the skill spread in the playlist while maintaining the sanctity of the card as the core of the Trials experience, and reward completed cards with a fresher start than if they just reset. OH! THAT'S THE KICKER! *If they reset their card before it is completed, it would take into account their win/loss at face value without any reduction.* (Curious to hear input on this)

# REWARDS

A key problem with the current system is the emphasis placed on tokens over gameplay. Players are pushed to run flawless once, then farm for easy wins and tokens on the lower half of the card. In my opinion, the only way to address this is to change how loot works in Trials entirely.

**FLAWLESS REWARDS**

The first step in putting things back the way they ought to be is to push people to pursue flawless beyond their first run. We've all been saying it, but it's about time that PvP has its own method of farming ascendant shards. *Please, for the love of God, let the Flawless chest always drop guaranteed Ascendant shards every run, as many runs as we want.* Repeatable pinnacle rewards is probably a bit much, but perhaps allowing pinnacle rewards for the first 2-3 flawless runs in a week could be considered - after all, it's far more difficult to complete flawless runs than it is to meme your way through Garden of Salvation once per week and get 4-5 pinnacle drops per character. (Again, curious to hear people's thoughts on this)

**REGULAR REWARDS**

Tokens, tokens, tokens.

It's great that we have a currency to make drops infinitely farmable in trials, but the tradeoff here is that the difference between the 5th win on a card and the 1st win in value is non-existent. There is a simple solution!

Let's make it so the token drop for each week is set for a single item and unlocked upon completion of the first card for that week - whether that's three losses straight or 7 wins. Additionally, the drops at 3, 5, and 7 wins should be repeatably earnable from getting those wins on a card. This helps to separate out the rewards across the length of a card, rather than just relying on unlocking a drop once and then farming tokens. Additionally, to address the issue of players attempting to farm only one drop at a lower portion of the card, we should provide an incentive for them to keep going and allow that drop to be repeated in each successive drop threshold, and for each drop to have a chance of being dropped as an additional reward from the flawless chest.

**SAMPLE REWARDS STRUCTURE**

Token Drop - Unlocked upon completion of a card that week, only 1 set drop per week.

3 Win Drop (T1) - Earned every time a player reaches 3 wins on a card. Also earned when hitting 5 and 7 wins, respectively, as well as randomly from the flawless chest.

5 Win Drop (T2) - Earned every time a player reaches 5 wins on a card. Also earned when hitting 7 wins, as well as randomly from the flawless chest.

7 Win Drop (T3) - Earned every time a player reaches 7 wins on a card. Also earned randomly from the flawless chest.

Flawless Drop (P) - Earned exclusively from the flawless chest that week. Also includes a guaranteed Ascendant Shard.

T1 = Tier 1 Powerful, T2 = Tier 2 Powerful, T3 = Tier 3 Powerful, P = Pinnacle

Introducing a system like this solves several of the most important problems with the current iteration of the Trials reward structure.

1 - invites new players to the playlist for a chance at rewards by allowing access to the 1 weekly token drop (even if they only lose 3 games and leave, it's more population for the playlist).

2 - Reduces the marginal benefits of farming tokens in terms of time : drops.

3 - Places an emphasis on pursuing completed, 7 win cards.

I don't intend to imply this fixes everything, but I think these changes could do a lot to improve the playlist. I'm curious to hear what people think!",0,1585465146,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr1pge/spitballing_my_ideas_for_a_trials_rework/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr1nem,aseaofreasons,The sorry state of PvE and Bungie’s vision,"Bungie’s Destiny so far has done nothing but show me what Bungie meant  when they told us boldly that they were finally making **the Destiny they wanted, which we now know is just more eververse.** 

While this season won’t be the nail on the coffin for the game by any stretch of imagination; however, I won’t let them get away with assuming that this game’s PvP carries enough weight to sustain the fact that their endgame approach has been completely atrocious throughout Shadowkeep. 

It’s hard for me to not believe that dedicating an entire season to trials isn’t just simply to pander to the streamers (which doesn’t seem to be going too swimmingly might I add) that allow them to cheap out on marketing. 

This season is what it took for me to feel like they are actively pushing me away by giving no credence to the very content they ship out. A great example are these seraph tower events. It is literally a chore to complete and takes longer than a legendary lost sector (assuming you’re sufficiently leveled). And the bounties give no importance to the things they designed for the season, why do they do this? 

Overall, *Bungie’s Destiny* to me is so unbelievably far off from what they’ve outlined and I don’t know if whatever they come out with next season will be enough of a springboard for whatever they’re planning for this fall’s expansion.

fr179w,xiiMaGzx,A response to the top post from a pvper,"**To see where we pvp mains are coming from**

Pvpers are not posting that raids are to hard because we cant get the one raid title but maybe we should and put some sbmm in pve? For every 1000 activitys completed the enemy's should gain a additional 200 health. That way we casual pvers can get a raid done and get that sweet title.

Now do you see where we are coming from? Why should the people that put in time to get better suffer from success? Why does that person need to sweat buckets in a span of 10 minutes when the other can sit back with some beer and sports on the side while playing. Now they both get the same title that one put there heart and soul into and the other got it without being able to see his monitor for half of the games because he knocked back to many beers.

We are not mad that a pinnacle pvp activity is becoming sweaty, we are upset that the one non sbmm gamemode is now a sweat fest and we will be once again playing for the championship.

The best of the best should only have the trials title. Casuals/new players complaining about comp made it brain dead easy to get to 5500 now so unbroken means nothing. So if you want to leave trials because you are getting your shit pushed in then do it. Not everything needs to be a handout like comp? One thing that is hilarious to me is seeing people asking for sbmm in trials because they are realizing they cant compete with good players. They are finally seeing what sbmm was sheltering them from in ""qp"" and ""comp"".

Ah yes with that out of my system let's talk solutions that will make things fair.



**Solutions**


Quick play or playlists besides pinnacle activitys - 

100 connection based mm all the time but to stop the new players from getting stomped there is a system in place called ""Time based matchmaking"". 

There will be 2 different leagues 

0-100 hours played 
 
And 

100- infinity 

With This system in place the ""noobs"" will never be stomped from the sweats and that's what we want right? For sweats not to get there who boost from noobs. 




IB - 100% connection based, there is no reason for sbmm here unless there is light level based mm right? Why should pvpers match 1010 pvers with a advantage? Anyway with jokes aside yeah 100% connection the net code is awful no reason to make it worse 



Trials - card based mm but you cant reset your card unless you lose a mercy or have a loss on the card. Also to make trials have more  Intriguing for those that dont have faith in making it flawless,  make (5) weekly bountys that give gear and give t2 powerful drops per bounty. (Pre character)

Next thing is to make going flawless worth it. Once toy have gone to the lighthouse once on that character you unlock a new color for a glow that stays **forever** not just for one week. Next all weapons drop with 2 extra perks to choose from. For example you have a choice between opening shot or (x) perk on the first column and the same for the second this will make going for god rolls easier but not make it impossible for those that haven't seen the light house. Finally last thing all armor should drop 60+ stat rolls there is no reason to slave away so much time to get to the light house just to get a 55 based armor roll



Those were all my options. I know I'll be downvoted for some of the hard to swallow things but I just hope you can see where we come from. And the end of the day we all love the same game there is no reason to spilt our community and say who is better then who. &lt;3",5,1585462526,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr179w/a_response_to_the_top_post_from_a_pvper/,DestinyTheGame,1

Usually, I just delete 'em and move on, but I was feeling generous and decided to feed the troll. They must have loved the flavor of chow I provided, considering they took the time to look up my stats (I play one card of trials because a friend convinced me that we could get 3 wins, take our loot, and leave) and look at my profile (how else would they know about my paltry gamerscore).

fr0w9b,thanosthumb,Revamp old raids to drop powerful gear and put them in a rotation to drop pinnacles,"I’m a hardcore raider in D2, but doing Garden week after week is becoming a bit… monotonous. It also hurts me to see the old raids get ignored simply because players don’t have much reason to do them anymore. Face it, if you have your 1K or Anarchy or your titles, you probably don’t do those raids too often anymore. Or maybe you do, but if you get a cool new drop, you have to infuse it up to the current power level.

Well I propose this: raise the power of each raid to a suitable level (idk maybe 900 or 920) and have the old raids and maybe the raid lairs drop powerful (tier 1 is fine) rewards. Even throw some champions in there if you’d like. This would incentivize new players to experience and learn what is, in my opinion, the best content D2 has to offer while providing some more ways to level up. For the veterans, they can go back in and try to get more rolls on our favorite guns and have them ready for use immediately.

Also, Bungie could put these on a rotation (such as order of release) to be 940 like Garden of Salvation and drop Pinnacle rewards. This would add a little spice to the endgame so as to not dull the only pinnacle raid activity we have while reviving the old raids once again. 

Maybe this is too much to ask but I figured I’d throw it out there. They’ve done it before with the Age of Triumph in D1. Who knows? This could be part of what we get in the next big expansion.

fr06z5,LacedaemonX,Am I willfully ignorant or blinded to the issues in trials,"Console 

As someone who is probably at the higher end of the spectrum in terms of pvp, I realize my observation/opinion will not fall in line with most of the posts I see on this sub (which is the main reason I decided to post) but here it goes.

I see constant posts and complaints about how sweaty trials is and how impossible the passages are regardless of how many wins you’re at, and I honestly just don’t see the games having been that hard the last few weeks. Yes, I am aware some (many?) teams were token farming last week for the shotty, turning off a lot of people to trials. My thing is that while I lost plenty of games last week and the week before, I genuinely think I can count on one hand the amount of stacked teams I’ve ran into over the course of the two full weekends. I’ve only ran one card this weekend so far so I’m excluding that. And I don’t feel like my idea of “stacked” would be far off from most others here. 

I very much enjoy looking at the numbers of my gaming sessions, practically every time I get off for the night I will take a look at destinytracker and whatnot to see my performance for the time I played. I like peeping players profiles whose names catch my attention, or if I remember the game being particularly hard etc.   Sometimes I put it off for a couple days but I eventually always get around to checking. Anyways practically every team I run into is rocking 1.4 kd or lower across the board. Practically all the teams I lose to also are around the same. Not exactly what I would considered stacked by any means. And I know that KD is NOT the end-all be-all of skill or anything like that, but I’m a firm believer that it’s a strong guideline for most players. I simply don’t see these hardcore “sweatlords” that the (seemingly) entire destiny reddit community does for every game. 

Personally, mytheory on the general outcry for trials is people just really aren’t going in prepared (Mentally) for an elimination game mode. Death means EVERYTHING in a game where people are used to it not being that huge of a deal.   Dead? Just come right back and try again! Not in elimination, death has big consequences. Not to mention being dead only exacerbates the issue, as that’s a lot of downtime depending on how quickly the rest of the round goes. 

I realize all I have is anecdotal evidence, maybe I just have some of the luckiest matchmaking in Trials. But my question really just boils down to this:

Am I delusional to think that trials isn’t as sweat infested as everyone makes it out to be? Or are teams of slightly above average players what the majority of the community considers “sweats” ?",3,1585457745,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr06z5/am_i_willfully_ignorant_or_blinded_to_the_issues/,DestinyTheGame,1

fr06at,Imayormaynotneedhelp,Streamers are not the problem. Bungie is. (A response to the post currently top-voted on the front page.),"Title. Don't know how popular its going to be to break the circlejerk going on in the current top post, but I felt I had to say something. I would have just put this in a comment, but it got so long I decided to make it its own post, so here goes:

**Streamers are not the problem with Destiny 2.**

**Bungie is.**

Its not the fault of streamers that bungie decided it was a good idea to put the best weapon of all the trials weapons (and arguably the only one worth chasing) at 3 wins. Like, this community has an honestly concerning obsession with doing everything as effieciently as possible, is it any suprise that people discovered the best way to farm this shotgun, and then abused the hell out of it? If there were some exploit like this in pve, no one would bat an eye. Now of course, thats because other players aren't being screwed over, I'm just making the point that expecting this community to know the most efficient way to farm a desirable piece of loot, and to *not* proceed to use that method, is stupid, of course people are going to farm that shotgun as fast as they possibly can.

Its not the fault of streamers that bungie can't give us a balanced sandbox. I've seen some sentiment among the community that streamers are the reason bungie sometimes makes such confusing balance decisions. But which streamer was asking for a Hard Light/Suros meta? Which streamer asked for Scout Rifles to continue to be bottom tier in pve? Which streamer asked for Sleeper to be nerfed into the ground? (okay, some said it was OP, but they all shut up after the first nerf, nobody was calling for the second or third nerf)

Its not the fault of streamers that bungie can't, or won't make a decent matchmaking algorithm. I'm an average player at best, but everyone I run into is always using the sweatiest loadouts. I don't think its my right to pubstomp, but I hate feeling railroaded into one or two sets of weapons to just compete. I feel like I can't do any remotely creative or fun loadouts because they'll just get shit on by **The Meta^TM**.

Streamers are not the reason that we get so much reskinned content. If anything, thats our fault as a community for constantly asking for D1 content. Alright, not everyone was asking for that, but a very vocal element of this sub won't shut up about how D1 is so much better than D2 and they should just port the entirety of D1 into D2.

Its not streamers fault that bounties have replaced actual content. If anything, this is the worst for streamers, its their job to play this game. If you hate doing bounties for 3 hours a day, imagine how it feels doing it for 6+ hours a day.

Leading on from my previous point, it isn't the fault of streamers that the grind has been increased to an absurd degree. Streamers want *more content*, they don't want the same amount of content, but artifically padded out.

TLDR: **Stop blaming streamers for bungies poor decisions.**",6,1585457657,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fr06at/streamers_are_not_the_problem_bungie_is_a/,DestinyTheGame,1

My thing is that while I lost plenty of games last week and the week before, I genuinely think I can count on one hand the amount of stacked teams I’ve ran into over the course of the two full weekends. I’ve only ran one card this weekend so far so I’m excluding that. And I don’t feel like my idea of “stacked” would be far off from most others here. 

I very much enjoy looking at the numbers of my gaming sessions, practically every time I get off for the night I will take a look at destinytracker and whatnot to see my performance for the time I played. I like peeping players profiles whose names catch my attention, or if I remember the game being particularly hard etc.   Sometimes I put it off for a couple days but I eventually always get around to checking. Anyways practically every team I run into is rocking 1.4 kd or lower across the board. Practically all the teams I lose to also are around the same. Not exactly what I would considered stacked by any means. And I know that KD is NOT the end-all be-all of skill or anything like that, but I’m a firm believer that it’s a strong guideline for most players. I simply don’t see these hardcore “sweatlords” that the (seemingly) entire destiny reddit community does for every game. 

Personally, mytheory on the general outcry for trials is people just really aren’t going in prepared (Mentally) for an elimination game mode. Death means EVERYTHING in a game where people are used to it not being that huge of a deal.   Dead? Just come right back and try again! Not in elimination, death has big consequences. Not to mention being dead only exacerbates the issue, as that’s a lot of downtime depending on how quickly the rest of the round goes. 

I realize all I have is anecdotal evidence, maybe I just have some of the luckiest matchmaking in Trials. But my question really just boils down to this:

Am I delusional to think that trials isn’t as sweat infested as everyone makes it out to be? Or are teams of slightly above average players what the majority of the community considers “sweats” ?

I played a lot on Xbox and was able to transfer over all of my gear thanks to cross save. I feel like I'm improving often spending most of my time on the solo que playlist for competitive and have been able to reach around 3000 glory points. I have been blessed with god-tier rng and I have the right weapon rolls to make a successful player, but I think I lack the skill. My friends refuse to take me into any mildly difficult pvp activity like competitive and trials, and I had to lfg to find a team last week on anomaly were we got three wins and used our mercy. It has gotten to the point where playing with me or playing a different game has become a no brainer. 

I'm looking for any tips on how I can better improve as a player in the crucible, my aim is horrible and I can never finish out any of my kills, leaving almost everyone I face to be cleaned up by teammates. I also struggle with reaming calm in gunfight which can cause my aim to go everywhere. My friends wont give me the time of day to help me improve so I'm stuck to watching all the YouTube I can on this. I've found MTashed and CammyCakes extremely helpful but I'm having a hard time using what I've leaned from them in pvp.

Do you like Ghost Projections, and if so do you have a favorite?

Do you ever notice any other player's ghost projection, or even your own?

Do you feel excited to get a ghost projection to drop?

fqzgls,Synavik,Why do we still have a Shader Inventory &amp; why do we not have the option to “Delete All” shaders yet? Also Shader Bug details involving Rahools deletion menu.,"Seriously though, what’s the purpose in the shader inventory? Time consumption when having to delete them? What we should be able to do is inspect our armor/weapons go to color it and it shows us EVERY shader we’ve unlocked thus far in the shader menu. I mean we can already pull any shader we want from collections, so just implement us being able to use any shader we’ve unlocked in our menu at the current cost it takes to pull a shader. 

On the topic of Shader deletion, why do we not have a Delete All function yet? What is the purpose of having an odd number of a kind of shader, only being able to delete 5 at a time, then having to open a whole other menu to delete the rest when you get to 4 or below? It makes no logical sense other than to consume more time and keep us in the game longer. 

We should have a delete all function. That would be a HUGE QoL update. I’ve caught myself just wasting vault space stocking shaders because I don’t want to go through the tedious task of Shader management. Please implement some sort of QoL update addressing this.

Shader Bug: It appears some Shaders do not function with Rahools deletion menu. That just flat out don’t show up, the ones I’ve seen thus far have been Season if Undying ones.

Like you'll get an exotic quest for some really amazing weapon, and step one is ""kill 500 taken hobgoblins on Io with a sniper rifle,"" step two is ""talk to this NPC,"" step three is ""generate 25 orbs of light indoors while airborne using a Void subclass,"" step four is ""talk to this NPC,"" step five is ""do a strike that you've already done a million times but this time it's different,"" step six is ""talk to this NPC,"" step seven is ""talk to this other NPC,"" and step eight is ""kill Calus with the 23rd round of your machine gun while at less than 5% health and 2 of your fire team members are dead,"" and then you talk to an NPC and you get the gun.

There's literally zero creativity in the quests. There are a FEW that at least TRY to be good. For example, Outbreak Prime in D1. But that quest was so convoluted that the only way people do it is by looking everything up and getting an LFG group to help them.

Can we stop with the quests that require you to grind in an extremely specific way multiple times??

I will say that the story presentation is better in D2 than in D1, but it's still lackluster. Story missions are always extremely short and unfulfilling. An 8 mission story DLC will take you MAYBE an hour to complete, compared to their Halo games where an 8 mission campaign would take you an entire day MINIMUM, and the story was laid out for you, not something you read outside the game.

Why can't they take the insane creativity and depth present in the lore and give it to us in the gameplay?? Why must the game be so repetitive and mindless??",10,1585453892,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqzaz5/what_i_wish_bungie_would_change_about_destiny/,DestinyTheGame,1

By some odd miracle shotguns magically disappeared from the game and I no longer had to worry about entire enemy team mindlessly running around with mindbenders(pun intended).

One hit kill class abilities such as shoulder charge were a thing of the past and they only dealt partial damage. Running straight towards enemies was a much greater risk for a lower reward now. 

The maps became larger and more open, more suitable for 6v6 game modes. The spawns were more dynamic and didn't spawn you spitting distance from enemy players.

I find it near ridiculous that this even exists and i understand that carriers are a thing and have the easiest time however move this feeling around a bit to cater to some casual players as well. 

- If you go flawless, you should match teams that have also gone flawless
- If you are farming tokens (have the Passage of Wealth)
- If you have yet to go flawless, you should match people the same

Now i know this a rant, i know they cannot fix things faster then normal however and this is really to cater to a fairer trials design instead of that competitive but something needs to be done about gatekeeping and farming, it is near ridiculous",0,1585452625,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqz04v/trails_of_osiris_gatkeeping_token_farmers/,DestinyTheGame,1

While wielding a sword as a Hunter, and preforming Gambler's Dodge next to an enemy, your melee charge is not refunded upon swapping out off the sword.

1. different subclasses change the explosion
   1. arc releases and arc web chain the same area as dunemarchers but i leaves you ""shocked""
      1. shocked 0.5 seconds you release another arc web effect chain
      2. enermie rank increases duration of the effect maxing at 5 sec, 
      3. guardians only give 1.5 sec per kill
   2. solar releases a explosive blast, that leaves enemies in radius burning as well as dropping a circle of fire on the ground
      1. fire on the ground lasts 5 sec and does exponentially increasing damage to targets on touching the fire
      2. kills proc the solar subclass perks that need ability kills (roaring flames, tempered metal but not sunspots)
   3. void releases a suppression field that lasts about 5 sec, as well as spawning 5 axion seaking bolts
      1. the suppression field works the same as the grenade but only lasts 2 sec after leaving the field and does not affect the player
      2. the damage, velocity, tacking, and blast radius of the axiom bolts increases the higher the rank of the enemy

There’s something so satisfying staggering an Unstoppable with your throwing hammer/knife and getting it back instantly. If you don’t have a good rolled hand cannon or dislike using them in higher level content, these two mods provide an excellent alternative.

This post might get lost within the sea of (legitimate) criticisms of the game, but if you disregarded the artifact in seasons past or are wanting to try something different, don’t overlook the last two columns of the artifact, there’s some cool stuff there to try out!",2,1585446138,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqxdbq/season_of_worthy_artifacts_mods_are_actually/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqxbmr,MayTixOnYT,How Trials Rewards should work (Of course this is my Opinion),"After playing Iron Banner this week and then trials. I realized I had more fun working towards bounties in Iron Banner which were Pinnacle instead of getting tokens for not powerful weapons and having to get to a certain amount of wins. If weapons were a thing you worked towards while going for flawless then people would stop resetting at 3 wins. I think this would make trials better in general and stop Skill creep which if you haven’t seen go look through this subreddit.

TL;DR: Make powerful rewards come from bounties so people can work towards them while going for 7 wins instead of resetting every 3 wins.",0,1585445966,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqxbmr/how_trials_rewards_should_work_of_course_this_is/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqx6be,Colonel_Soap,Trials Loot System,"From what I have seen, the nice idea behind Pinnacle weapons was that it was an achievable gun with specific rolls designed to be strong. After going flawless 9 times, it is very clear to me now I should never even dream of getting good sniper or shotty rolls. Of the past 16 drops I have gotten, 1 has been shotty, 0 sniper, 5 fusion and 6 rockets. If I am not garaunteed to get at least 1 sniper ever 3 runs, it means that on a good run, I will possibly get a shotty every 4 -6 hours of trials pay (flawless). And that is unacceptable due to the horrible rolls every gun can roll with.

fqx5nj,SixStringShef,An Alternative to Weapon Retirement,"We all know the problem and the reasoning behind weapon retirement. I’ll jump right to the idea.

Weekly, Monthly, or Seasonal Weapon Restrictions: Bungie has made it pretty clear their biggest concern is for high-end activities. They’re allowing us to keep our old weapons, just not upgrade them to new relevant light levels. So even though we can use those weapons still in lower light activities, it still feels like our guns are losing value. Instead, let us keep infusing/upgrading our weapons. But in new seasonal or pinnacle content (raid, trials, seasonal activities, ordeals, etc…) put on rotating restrictions. This week, no weapons from Warmind, Forsaken or Black Armory. Next week no weapons from Dawn, etc… That way you still upgrade your spare rations and mindbender’s, and they can still be viable… But maybe you have to take a hiatus from them for a month and find something else to use. Even a full season off wouldn’t feel so bad- because you’d know eventually you get your hard earned gun “back.” Again, to be clear- I’m suggesting these restrictions only exist in high-end content. Normal play like strikes, standard crucible, patrol, etc… is all normal. You just can’t load into high-end activities with certain things equipped and those weapons become disabled in that activity.

fqwsq0,triplecute,"Servers and ""Removed from game""","You know, there's not much that gets me absolutely pissed off within a game.  I understand bugs happen, server downtimes, etc.  However, I've been playing Destiny 2 for a little under 500 hours and had 'mostly' a good experience.  

I am so close to just uninstalling this game permanently because of one key issue.  I drift more towards PvP and enjoy the competitive 'Survival' game mode.  Where I haven't had tons of issues with servers, I've had more issues with them than in any other game.  Basically, I can kind of deal with it even if it's my worst experience within a game thusfar.  However, within the last two days, I have repeatedly been kicked from 6 competitive matches saying I was ""removed from the game world.""  This causes me to, not only, lose elo but creates a suspension.  

Because Bungie can't figure out simple server issues (As I don't experience this in any of the other 8-10 titles I play) I am losing my interest significantly.  I'm basically being punished to TRY and play the game.  This is probably the most horrendous shit I've ever seen from any game.  To support Bungie only to be repeatedly kicked from matches and then timed-out for 30+ minutes at a given time, I am losing all interest in playing this game further.  

Is anyone experiencing these issues?  If this happens again tonight, or within the next day, I will be uninstalling permanently.",2,1585444009,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqwsq0/servers_and_removed_from_game/,DestinyTheGame,0

fqwqw3,dark1859,You know it kinda feels like after drifter gambit was basically abandoned by the devs.,"I mean think about it, a whole expansion + now 3 seasons and no new maps, weapon balance is still basically non existent, invaders resistances and strengths haven't even been looked at since prime, FRIENDLY AI AS AN INVADER CAN STILL PUSH YOU as well as block shots, complete framerate death on 40% of the maps with all factions but fallen, and awful matchmaking + load times is just the tip of the iceberg of core issues. 

Look i know gambit isn't a big focus anymore but, it's completely unacceptable to just completely abandon activities period unless the activity is perfect as it is and cant be improved further (which i would argue has only ever been SRL). further facts are many of these issues HAVE BEEN ISSUES SINCE GAMBIT LAUNCH, and the fact they have yet to been fixed or even truly addressed shows either an unwillingness or inability to which is, you guessed it, pretty unacceptable at this point given we're approaching the 2 year mark since gambit's inception and have also had AN ENTIRE PAY TO PLAY SEASON IN SEASON OF THE DRIFTER WHERE THESE CORE ISSUES SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED.

I know i'm probably coming off as angry, and the answer is yes i am a little annoyed because bungie is a multi million dollar game studio, and you're telling me they can't even take shortcuts by lowering render distance or modifying spam heavy units that cause massive framerate issues to either not spawn or not spam to fix the framerate? or at least make a half hearted attempt to fix some of the more grievous issues.",385,1585443818,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqwqw3/you_know_it_kinda_feels_like_after_drifter_gambit/,DestinyTheGame,1
fqwq0h,Kahzgul,[Fan Fiction] The Worthy - Part I: The Dreg," **The Worthy – Part I** 

  
 The Machine God rumbled.  

Aqal'Mar did not look this time, but his concern was plain to see. “What are you staring at,” he asked Dreg Fon. “Did the first docking not teach you enough manners?” 

Fon quickly ducked. “Pity please,” he groveled. “I will learn.” 

Aqal'Mar sighed. He turned away, and Fon dared a glance. Now Aqal'Mar was looking directly at the Machine God. It hung there in its creche, sucking the ether from countless servitors, each one modeled in the Machine God's image. Fon knew that the intake had increased in recent days because his rations had been cut to a quarter of what they had been just a month ago, which was half what it had been last year. 

Fon turned back to his “work.” It was worthless, he knew. No amount of ether would ever be enough for such a beast. 

The Machine God rumbled and this time Fon winced. It was his impure thoughts, he knew. His sense that this was *wrong.* No, not just wrong, but Wrong. Wrong Wrong WRONG. 

This time the rumble was inside of his skull. 

*WRONG*. 

He cried out. Fell to the ground. Writhing in the slurry of his ether mining efforts, he screamed.

***WRONG.*** 

He scrabbled at his head, trying to rip it open and get the voice out. He gasped to breathe, felt his ether escaping through his skin, and begged the voice to stop. “Please,” he yelled so loundly his throat burned, “Please stop!” 

*STOP.* 

Everything was peaceful. There was a light, filling everywhere and everything. All of his experience was light. His arms were restored. His ether tanks full. He was a Captain. And his Kell was the Machine God. “no,” he thought quietly, “no no no no no no.” 

It was one thing to toil in servitude to a false god. It was another to be tempted by it. Fon had never heard of another Elsinki being spoken to directly, let alone promised these things, and it was so much more wrong than he had ever felt before. 

The light grew more intense. It pervaded everything. He felt it in his body, filling him with power. He *knew* the light. Could direct it at his foes. He saw Aqal'Mar and cut him down with a beam of arc energy. He fed the servitors void until they exploded and Fon drank their ether greedily. He clutched a weapon he had not known he had and lay fiery waste to the entire Ketch. 

Fon stood among the ashes of his clan, bathed in light, under the gaze of the Machine God. 

“Go away! Leave me alone! I don't want any of this!” 

*ALL WANT.* 

“Not me!” 

*UNWORTHY.* 

The light vanished. Fon fell to the ground, gasping. The shock was like being tossed into the vacuum of space without a suit. He felt the slurry in his fingers, squished it. Real. Right. 

The Machine God stopped rumbling. Without any sound, it severed the ether connections. It rotated in its creche. It rose, silently, bathed in light. And then it moved, so quickly there was a clap of thunder in its wake. And it was gone. 

The sounds of panic grew louder and louder as Elsinki for miles around let loose a great wail. 

But for Fon, sitting in the muck of his destroyed Ketch, surrounded by the death of all he held dear, a joy crept through his mind. For the first time in his life, he was truly free.

Im very bad at pvp and would never do it for fun, constantly dying is just not fun for me.

But this mercy ""feature"" is just the most annoying thing.

But no, if were not fast enough at the start, its just ""Well good luck getting a kill next game before im calling it after a minute because you blow.""

I dont think i will ever get this bow, i dont care if its bad, i just want to try getting every weapon in the game... i think i have to kiss that goodbye.

fqvj7v,Amdinga,End game content (trials) falls flat if the low and mid level content isn't also rewarding,"There's always a fine line to tread when it comes to introducing end-game content, where you want to keep some rewards exclusive to scale with the best performers, but you still want as many players as possible to take a crack at it regularly. Maintaining this is what prevents the skill creep that Ascendant Nomad was talking about a few days ago.  


To accomplish this you need most players to \*aspire\* to be good enough, at some point, to reach the end game rewards. But a necessary part of creating this sense of aspiration is to have meaningful and rewarding mid-level content for average and above-average players to chew on, while they keep their eyes on the end-game prize.   


The regular crucible just does not offer this type of content right now, and this is why trials will likely fall flat soon. There is no sense of progress from playing ordinary crucible; there are no meaningful rewards, no pinnacle weapons to chase, and what semi-useful gear there is comes from Iron Banner which is exactly the same as regular crucible but sweatier, more rules-based, and which requires significant PvE grinding due to LL requirements. Skill-biased matchmaking in many modes also kills any sense of skill progression for many players. The only reasons right now to play elimination or comp is if you enjoy the game types. Players need a sense of intermediate progression or the end-game will seem forever unobtainable to the majority of players.",8,1585439389,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqvj7v/end_game_content_trials_falls_flat_if_the_low_and/,DestinyTheGame,2

fqvcxu,Beals_a_Bud,"Bungie is doing the best they can, and Im sick of us as a community acting like children.","I know I am going to infuriate a lot of guardians with this, but I do not care. It's time someone spoke up. 

We need to stop complaining about Eververse and the season passes. 

Eververse may have been put into Destiny 2 by Activision to try and bleed us dry, but that isn't the case anymore. Now every bit of that store supports Bungie. So why are people crying for the death of it? If it was gone, then Bungie would lose a significant amount of income. Income that pays the people who make Trials of Osiris. Income for the Story of an ever-changing world. Have we forgotten this so easily? Are we truly so blinded by ignorance that we have forgotten that there are people who have to eat, pay bills, and live that are making this game? 

People, we cheered and wanted to support Bungie through everything. That includes the separation from Activision. And now here we stand, casting hate on something that has very little impact on the overall game? Whatever your stance on Eververse, you need to realize that it pays for the content that you love. (I want to be very clear here and say that im not saying you can't express displeasure, but have some dignity.) 

The past week of me checking this subreddit, it seems like I can't go onto a single post or comment section without someone slamming something about either Eververse or the lack of content. 

Guess what? We asked for this. We knew that Bungie wouldn't be able to put out the same stuff as they did with Activision. We knew there would be a massive change. Now we look out and all I see are complaints. This isn't the majority, but the choir of anger is so loud, that those who are just enjoying the game can rarely be heard. I for one have to tip my hat to Bungie. Because they keep delivering content, despite all the hate that is spewed from the posts. 

I won't apologize for my tone. Because if you are one of the types of people that I describe throughout this post, then you are what is wrong. You are a cancer growing inside the game. 

Thank you, Bungie, for creating a world that continues to grow.

fqv4ff,rotomington-zzzrrt,D2 is currently in a state of Power Leak,"We all know Bungie have announced their proposed plans for weapon sunsetting, and we all know some arguments for and against. However, considering the below average loot pools from both this season and the last, I can conclude that we're in a state of Power Leak. 

Power Leak is the opposite of Power Creep, where weapons/items are introduced that are worse in quality than previously available gear. Aside from a few notable outliers (basically the trials stuff), all of the weapons introduced this season are categorically worse than what was previous available.

* The Seraph HC has worse stats and perks than both the Service Revolver, Trust AND Oplative
* The Seraph Sidearm has worse stats and perks than Anonymous Autumn 
* The Seraph Shotgun has worse stats and perks than Emperor's Courtesy
* The Seraph SMG has comparable stats to other 600s, but worse perks than Every Waking Moment
* The Seraph MG has worse stats and perks than Bane of Sorrow and Fixed Odds, but has Firing Line so is a maybe for boss DPS

All of the Seraph Weapons are part of their worst respective archetypes, have worse stats than their counterparts and don't have perks to compensate. The inherent generation of Warmind Cells isn't good enough when the weapons are literally the worst of the worst, especially when armour mods are able to let you generate Warmind cells at a comparable or faster rate.  If you can't kill anything, you won't generate Warmind Cells. The Charged With Light mods had some interesting build opportunities with bonus damage and were less restrictive, but the Warmind Mods will be a gimmick that is buried with this season as a whole. I bought the season pass, and so far, there's nothing worth going for. 

If this cycle continues of weapons getting released that are worse than last season's offerings, we're going to end up at a point where nobody is going to grind for loot because older weapons are better despite being under leveled. Weapon Sunsetting won't work if older content becomes impossible due to the weapons being either too weak or too reliant on a gimmick to work.",37,1585437950,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqv4ff/d2_is_currently_in_a_state_of_power_leak/,DestinyTheGame,0

fquyqi,RedWolf807,Loss Forgiveness in the Crucible,"I know that Bungie is ""dealing with"" a lot of feedback right now, but I feel like this needs to be addressed.

In the era of constant Beaver codes, loss forgiveness needs to be implemented. Beaver codes are when you get booted to orbit while in a match. It is due to Bungie's network issues, not players'. Not only is it frustrating, but downright unacceptable that you will suffer a loss if you get a Beaver error in a crucible match. 

This is especially frustrating in the solo queue competitive playlist, which is where I spend the majority of my time. Because it is a Glory playlist, lost matches lead to a loss of Glory. When you ""leave"" two matches, you get suspended from the playlist. Bungie gives you a loss, and potentially a suspension, for their own network problems.

The other problem is for the two teammates who remain in the match. It is near impossible to win a 2v3 in competitive. That team of two will also receive a loss at that point. Now we have one error code leading to losses for three people, in which none of them were at fault.

Of course, sometimes people could just leave because they think the match will be lost. They didn't receive an error code; they just wanted to not waste their time. In that case, they are choosing to have the match count as a loss. However, the other two, again, will also receive a loss due to that player leaving. It is, again, almost impossible to win a 2v3. Those two players are now getting punished for something they had no control over.

I think that loss forgiveness should be implemented. We have been asking for it for years, and Bungie has never gotten around to making it. Why should two players, sometimes three, be punished for something that is out of their control? Whether it is through Beaver errors or someone just leaving early, we should not be getting punished. For some people, it takes hard work to get to high Glory levels, and it is frustrating, to say the least, when that Glory is taken away for no good reason.

tldr: Loss forgiveness, especially in solo queue competitive, needs to be implemented.",2,1585437403,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fquyqi/loss_forgiveness_in_the_crucible/,DestinyTheGame,0

So far I almost have all the available ones, but I’m just missing one more which is unbroken.

fquwk4,h34vier,"Fix your fucking game, Bungo.","I play Destiny on PC and like many, had hopes that things would be better when the move to Steam happened.

*We could not have been more wrong*

Everything, *literally*, everything is worse. 

Chat breaks constantly.
The clan list has not worked since the move to Steam (you cannot see any Clan members unless they are added to your friends list).
Joining other players fireteams is a nightmare that rarely works unless we all exit the game and restart Steam first.

And the errors.. OH the errors.

I have had more error codes in the last 2-3 weeks of Destiny than I have in the last 2+ years. A monumental amount of error codes. My clan tried to do a quick few raids the other night, it took us more time to even get all in the same fireteam than it did to complete the raid. Not even kidding.

I don't know what they changed a few weeks ago that has created all of these issues, but I went from having no problems ever to having problems all the time. I have gigabit internet, have never had connection stability issues, never had error codes before for 2 years! Now it's constant. What did they break this time?

Now the game is so fragile in any matchmaking event that I can't play anything other than casual crucible or Iron Banner because I get so many errors that I get suspended.

Just now I tried to play some solo comp. LITERALLY my first game, about halfway through I got anteatered and disconnected and suspended, picture because people love pictures: https://imgur.com/53XM7kP  

If the game knows enough to give me an error code, why doesn't it know enough to know that it disconnected me and non suspend me? I hardly even play comp (trying to finish Luna's since I have nothing else to do) and when I do lately I get dumped very frequently.

Destiny already has/had a ton of problems before all of the network/server errors, now it's so annoying and frustrating it's not even worth firing up the game. I can't imagine what people in Trials are going through, thankfully Bungie made it so I don't care about Trials so I don't get to experience that nightmare.

BUNGIE. FIX YOUR GAME.

Reduces the required number of kills by 1. You can reduce all of these down to one kill if you pick up enough (4 for most of enemies). However, the chance of you coming across that many lying around is really low.

I tried getting as many enemies as I knew about, some types are basically just hybrids of another so they weren't included as they get significantly harder to find.

Yes, you can use Tyrants surge as well, in fact it works great, but this is more for the people who don't want to use an arc subclass just to get a cell to spawn. This also allows for more open mod slots for the new warmind cells as well as use outside of this season.

fqubpw,Divide21,"Bungie, can we get harder End-Game Activities that are actually rewarding?","**This is just a suggestion, but I'd love to see some easy activities made extremely difficult but with purpose and incentives of doing them. I actually kind of enjoyed doing those Legendary Lost Sectors for the first week when I was power grinding because I was so 'under-light leveled' that I couldn't just run through guns blazing and be done within 1 minute. But the higher power I get, the easier it becomes and the less fun it is. Below are some examples based upon this season:**

**Master Lost Sectors &amp; Planet Adventures**

* Would be 1030 Light Recommended
* The weekly Flashpoint destination would feature a rotation of these activities resetting daily
* The first completion of each per week would be a Powerful Tier 3 reward and chance of Enhancement Cores / Prisms
* Modifiers: Match Game, \[X Burn weekly rotation\], \[1 buff daily rotation\], Extra Champions, etc

**Grand-Master Lost Sectors &amp; Planet Adventures**

* The Activities would be 1060 Light Recommended, the Final Boss (if one is available) would auto-scale power of your character to being negative -20 power, becoming a red bar enemy.
* You only get ONE attempt per weekly reset, per activity, if you fail, you lose out on a Prime Pinnacle (+4 Pinnacle Power) reward for completing both activities flawlessly as a challenge on the featured Flashpoint Destination. Completion of the two will complete Flashpoint.
* Modifiers/Playlist Rules:
   * Extinguish, Match Game, Extra Champions, Extra Shields, Enemies don't get Staggered
   * \[1 of the following, changes daily\]: Small Arms, Specialist, Heavyweight, Brawler, Grenadier
   * \[1 of the following, changes daily\]: Blackout, Iron, Glass, Grounded
   * \[1 of the following, changes weekly\]: Solar Burn, Void Burn, Arc Burn
   * \[1 of the following, changes based on the champion's needs\]: 
      * Overloads regenerate health and moves twice as fast
      * Barrier's Barrier health are doubled with an overshield
      * Unstoppables require to be stopped twice, and are immune to all but Primary Ammo damage unless stopped
   * 6-Player Activity, matchmaking disabled
   * Each player gets 1 Revive Token, there is no time-limit of wiping, if you die, you have to rely on the rest of your team if you cannot be revived. Use your tokens wisely on the best-skilled players.

**Oh and for the love of Destiny, please being back Hard Mode Raids.**

**Raids would have three difficulties as follows:**

**Normal Mode**

* All Raids in Destiny 2 would be power recommended to what they are as of their release after day 1, so standard, if that means Leviathan would be 300 or something and Last Wish say 700 or whatever they usually are
* Revive Tokens stay, but the death-wipe timer is removed
* The latest released Raid will give you Pinnacle Rewards as normal, but challenges are disabled

**Hard Mode**

* All Raids in Destiny 2 scale to the seasonal power level cap, for season 10, that would be 1000 Max Power, not Pinnacle
* The latest released Raid will give you Pinnacle Rewards as normal, but the end-raid completion reward and challenge rewards are guaranteed to be something that your character requires for a power upgrade, you cannot get rewards from both modes, only 1 per week per character.
* No revive tokens, no death-wipe timer, once you die, your out of the encounter until everyone is dead or the encounter has been completed - like Destiny 1

**Master Mode**

* A random Weekly Featured Raid will be up on rotation for the best of the best PvE Players, the Raid being Scaled up to 1030 Power at the start of the Season, and gaining +2 Power each week until Seasonal Reset. Making the Raid at the end of the season eventually become 1050-1060 Recommended.
* The latest released Raid will give you Pinnacle Rewards as normal, but the end-raid completion reward and challenge rewards have a chance to give a high-stat super rolled Exotic Armor Engram (75-85 base), replacing your Pinnacle reward you would usually get
* Champions are in all Raids to annoy you more
* The Raid will act similar to Day 1 Raids, but may seem more challenging. It will be easy to do mechanics as you would be use to them and know what to do, but you will have a hard time surviving from enemies. Regardless, due to power increase, if everyone is under-leveled it will most likely be a 3 phase per encounter
* Modifiers:
   * Random RNG and changes per ENCOUNTER. It can be anything from 2-3 Negative Modifiers to 0-1 Buff Modifier. Example below;
      * Last Wish, Riven Encounter - Blackout, Match Game, Extra Shields, Specialist
      * Leviathan, Calus Encounter - Match Game, Grounded, Solar Burn
      * Garden of Salvation, Gambit Motes Encounter - Iron, Glass, Arc Burn, Heavyweight

fqu6yh,PM_SHORT_STORY_IDEAS,"Leviathans Breath is a cool idea, with too many key flaws to be viable","Y'all are busy people, so I'll jump right in. The big things working against this weapon ever being picked are:

**1) 3 years of charge time**

\- It is a slow charging (2x as long as sleeper!) bow with chunk damage and aoe. Instead, you could have a rocket launcher (no charge time chunk and aoe), 1kV (faster charge time, comparable damage, more aoe), or sleeper (faster charge time and fire rate, chunk, piercing, and ricochet). Breath has highest single shot damage, *buuuuut...*

**2) Ah shit I'm out of ammo again**

\- sharing ammo levels with things like rocket launchers, sleeper simulant, 1kvoices and such low-ammo high-destruction exotic heavy weapons means it is directly competing for that slot. 1kV, Sleeper, and even xenophage are often better in every way. The only reason you might use the bow is to stagger unstoppable champions without using a special or primary slot, *BUUUUUT....*

3) Gets shit on by unstoppable champions

\- hand cannons do this things job, but faster and not at the cost of heavy ammo. Devils ruin does this things job but flashier, faster, and not at the cost of heavy ammo. But that isn't even the biggest part:

**Unstoppable champions take reduced damage until you stagger them. The precious 1/12 of your heavy reserves that you use on that shot won't even do half damage, because the unstoppable champion will still have it's damage reduction up. It** ***literally*** **makes more sense to stagger an unstoppable champion with a hand cannon and** ***then*** **shoot it with this bow, than to use its exotic perk.**

So basically, here's what I would change:

\#1 charge time: 1400 --&gt; 1150, precatalyst. 

\- Make it the longest charge time bow in the game, but recognize that we don't need to wait a year: it's heavy exotic bow, it doesn't need to be crippled as well.

\#2 ammo reserves: 11ish -&gt; 15ish

\- If you are going to use something less wieldy than sleeper, less variable than 1k, and less easy than a rocket, give it more reserves. This also helps in champion content, so you don't need to save all your shots with the bow just to deal damage.

\#3 unstoppable champions: 2x damage to unstaggered, or just anyway. (Or have it debuff things it hits)

\- You shouldn't be wasting damage when attacking literally the intended target of the bow. Either the staggering shot should be buffed, or all damage against unstoppable champs should eb buffed to compensate. *with this bow, you should see an unstoppable champion and cackle as you pull out your harpoon god-killer of a bow, before obliterating the champion from existence in 2 shots.*

&amp;#x200B;

fqu60d,Frostyhobo47,I have never understood how Bungie sees how special ammo is balanced from weapon to weapon. As in using a sniper is completely different risk/reward to using a fusion or shotgun.,"TLDR at bottom

So basically for special weapons every type of special weapon excluding eriana's vow each special bullet equals one kill if playing to that weapon's strengths, however there has always been a big issue of risk/reward for the different weapons.

For example a **fusion rifle**, it's a mid range one hit kill weapon which is an all or nothing risk situation which also requires you to be charging a shot which gives audio indicators to enemies. Then top that off with the fact that fusions fire a spread of bullets so you have to hit people with a large number of those pellets.

**Shotguns** are probably the highest risk special weapon, you have to get the closest to enemies which means you are open to melee attacks and you have to deal with the crazy movement speed and jumps in this game. 

Then look at **snipers**, these have the lowest risk to a kill, the only risk to running a sniper is the fact that you are giving up a fusion or shotgun.

**Arbalest** is a unique special linear fusion but if we ever get legendary linear fusions they are slightly lower risk than a sniper, but that's just due to having a charge time and a very low zoom

**Special GLs,** as there aren't many of these and really the only one that seems to be a problem in pvp is mountaintop I would say this slightly above a fusion in terms of risk as you still have to actually get into combat and bear nearish to enemies

The issue here is the reward for all special weapons are the same, however the closer you get to an enemy the more risk you will endure b/c you begin to open up what other weapons can compete with you at that range; take a sniper for example, about the only thing that can compete with a sniper at long range is a scout rifle, which probably takes about 3-4 headshots to kill the enemy sniper while the enemy sniper only has to land one headshot or a body shot which puts the scout user at a distinctly lower health, or arbalest but again it is unique item so just take what I said about risk compared to snipers (one is a instant click and the other you have to charge).

Bungie has through game design time and time again tried to lower special weapon usage, however the issue really isn't special weapons in general, it's mostly just snipers because they offer the lowest risk but still have the same reward as other special weapons.

If you understand what I'm saying about how the risk opens up as you get closer but the reward can only stay the same b/c outside of collat'ing people snipers are well above the curve of risk reward for pvp. Then another note is that snipers are about the only special weapons that actually benefit from the aim assist stats on weapons in a major way.

Here are some Ideas I had to possibly tune down the advantages to special ammo:

Depending on what type of special weapon a player uses you get ammo at a certain point after spawning. This would be based off of risk/reward so it would look something like this

* fusions - spawn with this ammo instantly like right now 
* Shotguns - get ammo 5 seconds after spawning 
* snipers - get ammo 10 seconds after spawning 
* Special GLs - get ammo 10 seconds after spawnig 
* Arbalest or other special linear fusions  - get ammo in 7 seconds 

This would lead to players having to actually survive long enough with the lower risk/reward weapons in order to utilize them which leads to higher primary weapon fights and if that player is both good with primary weapons and special then they are just a good player.

This would also only affect initial spawns so that if you really are a good sniper and you choose to use a sniper and you never get killed and are able to recover special ammo then good for you you get to take advantage of being good.

**Tldr:** Different special weapons should have ammo given to them at different times after spawning in pvp due to the fact that not every special weapon has the same risk/reward for a kill.",13,1585434690,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqu60d/i_have_never_understood_how_bungie_sees_how/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqtu03,PM_SHORT_STORY_IDEAS,"looking past it's problems, Champion Content is a great addition to the game","Title.

In terms of fun things in destiny, there's little I love more than a bit of challenge, and melting bosses. Champions are a taste of that: unique mechanics that force you to deal with them in a certain way, and then a 'dps phase' once they are staggered to burst them down. In fact, with the regenerating abilities f barrier and overload champions, you are *required* to burst them down.

Most champion nightfalls and legendary lost sectors are the most fun PvE content I do. 

There are some things the system could use, though obviously most have been repeated ad nauseum

1) more build options for dealing with champions

\- self explanatory, let us use exotic weapons in our loadout to combat champions. If you don't do this, you end up with the system we already have: use your exotic slots to run izanagi and divinity, stun champions, and delete them. It combats all champions, and since exotic slots basically *can't* be used for anything else in champion content, we use it on those weapons.

2) more champions (races)

\- scorn and  taken champions would be pretty cool. Bungie has been adding these, and I think its fun to go up against new champion types

3) more champion types

\- we have overload, anti-barrier, and unstoppable, it might be cool to have extra challenging opponents with either a new trait, or combinations of these traits. Maybe I'm a masochist.",4,1585433594,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqtu03/looking_past_its_problems_champion_content_is_a/,DestinyTheGame,2

fqtmwu,Niietz,Recommended group composition for new players starting together?,"Hey guys,

I know this has probably been asked a few times, sorry about that. I'll start to play d2 with 4\~5 friends and was wondering if there are ""recommended"" group compositions for activities in general or, at least, how we should split ourselves between classes/subclasses so we don't make things too hard on ourselves.

I understand that the focus should be primarily on choosing whatever we think is fun and enjoy playing, but still, I'd like to ask if there is anything we should know about group comps (as in, have at least one of X and one of Y per group).

Edit. I'm asking assuming we'll do ""endgame"" content such as raids etc.

fqtfqk,VertWithCrohns,Trials flawless loot is underwhelming,"Ok flawless loot in ToO. It is crap.  
For some people a flawless run can be done in reasonably a fast amount of time and for some it can be a sweat-fest of pain. From that you can an ascendant shard and a small chance at a rare sparrow. This loot is stupid, you could just run one or two Ordeal nightfalls and have just as much loot to your name. Trials is meant to be a high endgame activity and in a game like Destiny which is completely driven by loot it makes these sort of activities a must for top quality loot and not just 1 material which you will use in a second.

I thought flawless was gonna have the armour as an exclusive considering from the first week the gauntlets were only obtainable from the flawless chest. I found this to be good because it gave some sort of cool way to show off to people that you went flawless. After the second week came around and the gauntlets were on the 7 wins reward I was sort of shocked to realize ToO's famous flawless achievement was just going to be an inefficent way to get an exotic material each week. I am 100% with people who think that going flawless alone is an achievement in itself, but as i mentioned before..

fqtent,rezmeihaveghorn,"The reward system for trials needs to be changed, I have an idea if you guys are willing to read.","So the current reward system is broken, only being able to get what you’ve unlocked from packages needs to be removed and the entire loot pool needs to be in there by default. The current 3 win, 5 win and 7 win reward drops can stay to mitigate bad luck and the rotation of items can stay too to mitigate bad luck even more, maybe you can’t get the sniper from a random drop, that’s okay it’s in the rotation, go and try to get it, speaking of random drops, everything can have a chance of dropping from the end of a match win or lose, winning has a better chance to reward you with a drop, continued wins increase the chances of drops up to 10 wins in a row with a 35% chance of higher for a weapon drop.

Additionally, you cannot reset your card until you’ve filled it out, be that going flawless, or throwing matches to reset faster, this is to prevent higher skilled players from gate keeping the 3 win drop from lower skill players.

One more thing, each week saint will have a challenge, completing the challenge will reward a set weapon with a random roll.

fqsvwh,mrfurion,Trials incentive system is bizarre,"I'm a new light player and dad gamer who plays about 6-8 hours of D2 a week. I'm solid average at PvP (made it to 4000 glory quite comfortably last season and usually land mid to high on the scoresheet in classic mix). 

I tried trials last night with one better player and one worse player, and I quit after 3 matches. Not because we lost them all, but because it offers me nothing for participating. Unlike comp/IB I don't get any drops after each game, and since I have zero chance of a 7 win card (required to unlock the sniper this week... who wants a non-exotic rocket launcher?!) the one trials token per game is no incentive whatsoever. 

If they want the game mode to succeed they need to do two things. First, provide strong incentive for ultra sweats to go deep into a card. I mean things like ascendant shards or guaranteed 70 stat masterworked armor or something. Second, provide meaningful rewards for participation by average players so there's plenty of people at various skill levels playing. 

I don't care if I can never earn a particular pinnacle/exotic weapon. But why the heck would I play the same map over and over again against ultra sweats for LITERALLY ZERO REWARD when every other PvP mode offers me a range of quest items and random drops for my participation in games that I have a chance of winning?

I understand this is meant to be the pinnacle PvP activity. But if only 5 percent of the player base are even showing up after a few weeks, I think we can agree that's a failure of a game mode.",24,1585430595,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqsvwh/trials_incentive_system_is_bizarre/,DestinyTheGame,8
fqsvvb,ShrevidentXbox,Season 7 is inherently inferior to season 8 armor. And I think that's an issue.,"*Season 7 armor

Due to season 6 not having any of its own armor mods, Season 7 armor has gotten shafted. It can  hold only season 7 and 8 mods. Season 8 armor on the other hand can hold 7, 8 and 9. This creates an awkward situation where Opulent armor is technically pointless.

I know, I know. Some may prefer how Season 7's armor looks. They might also already have good rolls on that armor. It's also easier to farm and seems to come with a higher stat total on average. There's also triumphs for the Tribute Hall that require Opulent gear.

Those are valid points.

But think about it. If you had 2 pieces of armor, one from Season 7 and one from Season 8, that were the same in every single way, the Season 8 armor is automatically better.

The solution that would probably come to mind first is to have mod slots skip past Season 6 since it has none of its own mods. So, Season 5 armor would be able to have mods from Seasons 4, 5 and 7. And Season 7 armor would be able to use mods from Seasons 5, 7 and 8.

But this obviously creates another issue where Dreaming City armor gets the shaft and can only use mods from 2 Seasons. 

So, I'm not even sure what should be done, if anything. I mean, it's really not the biggest issue in the world. But it's just strange to me that one seasons armor would be inferior to another's in such a way.

fqssvx,Ravenwood03,A few suggestions on how I think some aspects of the game should be changed,"Sorry for any bad formatting, I'm on mobile

To begin with, incase people don't want to sit and read through this post on how I would change/implement any changes, here's a list of the things I would want changing

1. Trials exotic ornament being awarded for gong flawless with the weapon
2. Exotic emblems for completing catalysts
3. Collection tab for emotes
4. Spectator mode for custom games
5. Champion mods for exotics
6. Loadout sets
7. Guardian tribute in the tribute hall

So, for point 1, the ornaments seem to be made for going flawless, with colour changes with flawless emblems, so why aren't they? For a solution for this I thought it would be a good idea to get them for going flawless with the gun I'd do it like a hidden quest (so you can't see what gun/your progress) with requirements being:
          Primary weapon:
                     20 kills
                     Go flawless
          Special weapon:
                     10 kills
                      Go flawless
          Heavy weapon
                      5 kills
                      Go flawless
This should create a (hopefully) fun and rewarding way of varying people's loadouts (at least for the first week) and it will start bringing good cosmetic rewards into endgame activities, which has been requested for a while.

For point 2, maybe not exotic emblems, but good looking (possibly animated) emblems that have a unique tracker for lifetime kills with the gun. It should be easily rewarded now that there are triumphs based off completing catalysts.

For point 3, it's not much, but when we had the old bright engram system, you could see all the new emotes that came with the season, so any that came into the store to pay for them directly, you knew which ones you wanted. All of the new things in the store are now visible in the seasonal section of the store except for emotes. That means that if I can only get 1 of something like an ornament, I can see what the best are, but I have no way of previewing emotes until they come up to be bought in the store, so if not a collections tab, at least add them to the seasonal section of the store.

For point 4, I feel like a free cam mode in a private match would make things like torments or even just funny videos, feel like this needs the least explanation and is probably the easiest to implement

For point 5, I think that all exotics should get an opportunity to be used in high level nightfall ordeals, and the only ones you can use are Erianas vow, devils ruin, leviathan's breath and divinity, or you would be pretty much letting the team down as you are sacrificing a slot for a gun that can be used to take out a champion. If you think this will make the previously mentioned exotics useless, they should be given a mod slot too, which lets them have two types of ammo at once, such as an anti-barrier and unstoppable shot from Erianas vow.

For point 6, I think that we should get a new tab to the character page, which lets you create loadout sets, to let you just click a button to change, or just have a loadout for an activity, which changes your loadout as you launch the activity (probably should have this as a feature to turn on and off) and it should make it easier than loading into a loadout locked activity and realising that you forgot to equip your champion mods.

For point 7, I think that in the tribute hall there should be a guardian tribute that you can buy. You would be able to change the loadout based off any weapons in your collections (random rolls would just give the tribute the curated roll) with sliders for all stats and probably an option to get it to constantly shoot at you or not (this would be for if you want to test what guns antaeus wards can block or something like that) I get that this would probably be the most difficult to add and the least likely one to be added out of everything on the list.

fqssnd,JustAGuyWhoLurks,What if flawless weapons dropped with unique perks and a animated shader?,"For example, what if all players could farm tokens no matter what amount of wins you have for normal perks but flawless has an additional perk completely unique to flawless itself. For example, the shotgun gets timed payload, the auto rifle gets firefly and the sniper gets the reversal of fortune perk on revoker? What if the drop was rare for each weapon but getting it would have prestige on its own?

 Combine this with a animated shader such as maybe a time torn shader with bits of the gun floating over a singularity (purely just a fun example) and it would probably fix the current issues with trials and inspire more players to go flawless or play trials. Want the base guns? Play trials. Win or lose, you can get them. Want the shotgun with timed payload and a sick ass shader? Be prepared to sweat. 

 I’m not a developer and I’m just average at pvp, but I feel that reworking these weapons to not only have the power of a timed payload shotgun or a firefly auto and prestige of showing off these weapons in the tower, etc would fix trials. 

TLDR; shotgun with timed payload as flawless reward with cool ass shader? I think yes.",4,1585430310,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqssnd/what_if_flawless_weapons_dropped_with_unique/,DestinyTheGame,1
fqsrdr,Dreadking_Hunter,The PvP Paradox,"So with Trials back for another weekend, people are already discouraged to play Trials with the amount they got their teeth kicked in while content creators seem to be encouraging more gatekeeping just because it's supposed to be a pinnacle PvP activity.

With that gatekeeping, the player base for Trials has shrunk from the first week and people are now annoyed with going up against people of their skill level, are now advocating that players just got to, as the classic phrase goes, ""Git Good.""

But it is rather hard for the more casual player to match up against people of their skill level and end up, as I said at the beginning, getting their teeth kicked in. When that happens match after march after match, the psychology of it makes the team more agrivated, and likely to start blaming their teammates and not recognize their own failings, leading to just leaving the Trials playlist.

Can Bungie balance the neediness of streamers and content creators, while not fully gatekeeping for Joe Everyman that allows for people to try and get better? Who knows, but in my opinion finding a middle ground would be the best option to keep Trials alive.

I just spent all my bright dust on the ornament in eververse, and then tried to equip it on my crown of tempests, which is an armor 1.0 one I'm still using since it's by far my best roll. Went to the ornament slot to equip it, and the new ornament wasn't there. I spent a while being baffled looking through my inventory before going to google and reading to try an armor 2.0 version, and voila! After printing the stock roll from collections, the ornament was able to equip on that one. Even tried restarting my game just to make sure that my 1.0 one wasn't bugged, and still no luck with it. It takes quite a while to get the 2k bright dust nowadays, and I've just wasted all of it on an ornament I now can't use without sacrificing my stats majorly, when I could've spent it on something else.

So I ask, why this restriction? Lot's of people are still using armor 1.0 versions of exotics if they have great stat rolls, and the ornament slot already exists on them. Is this a bug or some kind of weird design choice? Has anybody else had a similar issue?

fqrzvg,Vips_The_Imbecile,Exotic Primaries with Anti-Champion Buffs Concept,"So recently (and by recently I mean since Season 9 really), I've been seeing a lot of people complaining about how in NightFall Ordeals and Seasonal Content we can't use our exotics against Champions as exotics cannot implement anti-champion mods, ruining the point of ""Play your way."" Upon some further brainstorming, I've created a list of Primary ammo Exotics (and a few exceptions) with their own unique Anti-Champion buffs. List follows:

Sweet Business              - Barrier/Overload

Strum                               - Overload (with Storm and Stress)

Huckleberry                     - Unstoppable

Ace of Spades                 - Overload (with Momento Mori)

Wish-Ender                      - Heavy Barrier\*

SUROS Regime               - Unstoppable

MIDA Multi-Tool            - Unstoppable (after successful shots)

Vigilance Wing              - Unstoppable

Rat King                         - Overload

Cerberus+1                   - Barrier/Unstoppable

Outbreak Perfected    - Overload

Monte Carlo                  - Overload

The Jade Rabbit            - Unstoppable (with The Fate of All Fools)

Crimson                         - Overload   (After successful shots)

Bad Juju                          - Unstoppable?   ///////

Fighting Lion                 - Overload/Unstoppable

Sunshot                          - Unstoppable

Graviton Lance              - Barrier (does more damage to barrier if aimed down long enough)\*\*

Skyburner's Oath         - Barrier

Riskrunner                     - Barrier

Hard Light                      - Overload/Barrier

Polaris Lance                 - Overload and Unstoppable (with Perfect Fifth)\*\*\*

Trinity Ghoul                 - Unstoppable(on perfect draw) \[Lightning Rod does Overload\]\*\*\*\*

Le Monarque                 - Overload(on perfect draw)

Symmetry                      - Overload/Unstoppable (with Revolution)

Tommy's Matchbook   - Barrier

The Last Word      - N/A

Thorn              - N/A

Lumina             - N/A

Malfeasance        - Barrier?  ///////

Tarrabah           -N/A

&amp;#x200B;

\[Note: Any weapon with two buffs (ex. Unstoppable/Barrier) means either one or the other. I'm uncertain which one they will have\]

\* Heavy Barrier means the weapon will do an increased amount of damage onto a Champion's barrier than normal anti-barrier weapons, nearly if not completely devastating a barrier with one shot

\*\*The Anti-Barrier buff will have a sort-of Anti-Unstoppable hand cannons treatment as aiming down sights long enough with grant increased barrier damage for that initial burst

\*\*\*When Perfect Fifth is activated the explosion will act as both an Overload and Unstoppable shot

\*\*\*\*Trinity Ghoul is initially an Unstoppable weapon. It's trait, Lightning Rod (chain lightning), will act as an Overload attack

&amp;#x200B;

There are 5ish weapons I choose not to categorize, that of which being the raid weapon and the Hand Cannons regarding the Shin/Yor Legacy. If there are any changes to the weapons that are better suited to each one, I ask of you to write it down here. I will do all Special ammo Exotics sometime soon.

fqraoz,TripleMoonPanda,I found a way to get nearly the same boss DPS out of xenophage as a dodge reloading hunter using a warlock build. . .,"A lot of people think warlocks can't get the most out of xenophage during a damage phase on a boss like a hunter who uses their dodge reload can. But that is not true and I have found a way to do it. To do this all you need is 3 things. 

1. xenophage
2. Transversive Steps
3. Traction mod

First get into well like normal and start firing at boss. Once mag is empty quickly sprint in as tight of a circle as you can for about 1.5 seconds until you see it reload the gun. Then quickly relocate the boss and fire second clip, rinse and repeat until out of ammo or until damage phase is over.

I actually tested this out in garden of salvation last night and it worked great and did much more damage then just emptying one clip and switching to a sniper.

Plus it's really fun and silly to run in a super tight circle around everyone in the middle of a boss fight.

This technique works and is super effective at getting the most out of your xenophage while still using your warlock class. It's not as good as a titan with actium war rig but I think it just as good as a reload dodge hunter, or at least as good as you can get.",32,1585425595,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqraoz/i_found_a_way_to_get_nearly_the_same_boss_dps_out/,DestinyTheGame,2

I'm cool with random trash being shard able, but I mean seriously. I'm actively trying to use something other than Revoker and the inability to modify the weapon in addition to the useless perk has rendered it an instant shard man. This is supposed to be some of the most premium loot in the entire game and it's rolling with hip-fire grip for a weapon with no CQC reticle man. Come on. Just a little bit of attention to what's dropping. My flawless drop for the sniper was garbage and the token sniper is not usable.

Edit: Some loot will always naturally be better. I have a perfectly rolled Astral Horizon, but loot at this level shouldn't drop and be an instant shard given how very strict the token economy is. It's not like I went and ran over to a green chest in the EDZ man, I just played for two hours and turned in tokens in the top PVP event in the game sometimes earning those tokens literally one at a time. u/dmg04",98,1585425524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqr9um/can_we_cull_the_loot_pool_just_slightly_im/,DestinyTheGame,3

fqqtou,Kamunt,I honestly do not understand the hatred of Eververse here.,"If you just do all the weekly Crucible/Vanguard/Gambit/Banshee-44 bounties, you usually get enough bright dust to get at least one cosmetic per week, outside of some of the exotics.  The bright dust economy is bad, no question, I totally agree with that, and it's silly that the bonus bounties only give 10 per completion, and that there aren't more reliable ways to get it.  But it's not like I want every single cosmetic that pops into the store, and many of the weapon skins (and even the seasonal class armor cosmetics) rotate into the bright dust store at a reasonable enough rate for me to bank up bright dust to buy them.

Like...just...don't buy everything you see and it won't be a huge deal.  Most of the weapon/armor skins, ships, ghost shells, emotes, and projections aren't even that good-looking to me, I can't imagine spending money on them.  I've never felt pressured to spend extra money because I know most of the newer cosmetics rotate into the bright dust store eventually--I like shiny things (Fortnite slayed my wallet), and there is very little shiny things to buy in DF2P.  I admit I do some of the bonus bounties just so I can save up bright dust just in case of a holiday armor cosmetics, but I rarely find myself hurting for bright dust.  Maybe it's because I'm a New Light player, but it has honestly been a pretty fine experience for me.",12,1585424086,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqqtou/i_honestly_do_not_understand_the_hatred_of/,DestinyTheGame,0

fqqq06,Soviet-Anime-Hunter,"If bungie isn't going to change ttk values for different archetypes, then maybe we should have an archetypes rework","This might be a long read, so tldr will be at the bottom.

This mostly goes for hand cannons since that's the big issue going on. 150's dominate the field and many people have been asking for a change. even if damage values for 110's and 140's get changed, people still might not want to use them, since a 1 headshot 2 body can still easily lose against a 150. So to that, I feel like we need a rework on the different weapon archetypes to make things more fair. 

A good example for 110's would be (in my personal idea) would be to have a sort of natural high Cal to compensate for the slow fire rate. A 110 who can flinch like hell vs a fast 150 would be a balanced fight. Another example could be like how aggressive frame shotguns work, where getting a kill increases rpm for a short time.

140's are more tough then that. Competing directly with 150's, now more than ever since the range nerf. It's hard to come up with a better archetype for this, but I think that 140's should have a less severe damage dropoff, making it viable at longer ranges compared to 150's, without breaking the game like pre shadowkeep.

150's are fine at the moment. The lightweight frame gives better handling, which works well with other weapons. If things were to change, maybe give it natural snapshot since it's ""lightweight""

180's, being fast fire and with the precision Archetype, allowing for pretty much no recoil deviation and superb in air accuracy, are also a tough cookie to crack. What bothers people with 180's is not only ttk, but the gun is just too hard to aim for most people. Another problem is that Luna/nf are also in this 180 archetype while still being 150's. I think that this should only apply to 180's and not Luna/nf, since that would be bad. What I would do sounds weird, but maybe a hidden perk that sort of works like an auto rifle perk called dynamic sway reduction. Having a better accuracy cone and aim assist cone the longer you fire the weapon would just generally make it easier to aim the weapon. I know it sounds weird since precision frame weapons pretty much don't experience significant bloom, but like I said earlier, the problem is that it's still too hard to aim with due to recoil animation mixed with fast fire. So a weapon that actually increases aim assist the more you fire it would help land shots. Again to balance this, keep the ttk the same

Surprisingly, there's actually one more archetype that many people don't know exist, being the double fire archetype. This is only for the weapon ""the wardens law"", but I'd like to see it heavily brought back to the game with other weapons. The way this one works is it's a 110, but the damage is split between the two bullets, having a total damage being 1 higher that a normal 110. There was originally hype for this, since it was originally found to come with the perk 4th times the charm, where landing 4 hits loads 2 into the mag, and seeing as 2 hits is 4 shots for this gun, it'd mean infinite ammo. Of course that'd be broken, so bungie didn't allow the second bullet to actually count as a second bullet, meaning the trigger would have to be fired 4 times, consuming 8 bullets, and giving back 4. Anyway, the change I'd like to see done with this frame would actually be an rpm change, as well as a sort of full auto. I feel like this should be either a 140 or 150, but have it be like crimson where it fires the extra bullets consecutively, not at the same time. This would actually make the weapon a fun and different feeling weapon that I'm sure many would use. 

Something I Didn't mention in my title is weapon perks since that seems like the big thing going on as well. I feel like different weapon archetypes should only be able to get specific perks, such as reload perks being only available for 110's, stability perks and range perks for 140's, damage perks for 150's, and handling and range perks for 180's

TL:DR, weapons archetypes need a change. 110's should have natural high Cal or the aggressive frame shotty perk. 140's need better range or less damage drop-off, 150's can stay the same, and 180's should have better aim assist. Also buff double fire frames and make perks specific to different archetypes.",5,1585423752,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqqq06/if_bungie_isnt_going_to_change_ttk_values_for/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqqdep,Oilxd,Eververse,"Unpopular Opinion:
I love destiny with a passion but there is 1 thing which seems to annoy everyone, Eververse.

I understand the frustration about Eververse but what people dont seem to understand is that Eververse is a must for Bungie as it is a standalone publisher now. This allows them to have higher budgets for the content we want and are able to make them amazing.

One point I think needs to be made to them is that the community wants most of these amazing looking ships, sparrows and stuff to be something we grind for not pay for, something to flaunt and be proud of, we dont want reprised armour every year and clunky looking ships like the one from zero hour. They need to find a balance, not only that but we as a community needs to support Bungie not tear them down, we owe them more than we think, they have helped us make memories and cheer some of us up in depressing times. Stop harassing them to take down Eververse instead support them more so that we can see this amazing stuff which is in Eververse as grindable items to flex to our friends and the wider community.

I don't know what the average age of the people in this subreddit is... but let me tell you, back in my time, games wouldn't let you shoot through any object that was partially non-solid. Say like stairs, banisters and fences etc.

And today, during the Moon's bunker buster, I noticed myself holding back from shooting an enemy in the face just because there was a little piece of banister between us. **DO YOU REALIZE THE EFFECT** this subconscious brainwashing has had on me? This has kept me from achieving my maximum level of faceshootings in games for many years!

After some hesitation I proceeded to pull the trigger of my Recluse, lo and behold, the Destiny engine accepted that my bullets could pass through railings!!! So, start shooting through stairs, banisters and fences today! We could be so much more amazing killers than we are now. Realize the potential.

fqp1j9,zyphilz,My thoughts on how to fix trials,"First, Trial coins for engrams with an entire pool of equips, not just weekly rotations. Have two engrams, one being only weapons, the other only armor, both costing 20 coins each. Have each match drop 5 per win, or 2 per loss. Have the armor drop higher stats like within the 58-62 range.

Secondly, reward flawless players with permanent ornaments. Have adept weapons make an appearance with intrinsic perks. But also include a small percentage for a completely all black shader with a trials gold glow on certain parts, that appears on the armors given. Incentivize a reason to go flawless even if its purely cosmetic, or a decentish perk on a weapon. Have flawless armor drop 63-65 stats or higher only.

The engrams should give the players who do poorly an incentive to continue playing. Higher stats and better perks, with ornaments should give players an actual, tangible goal besides e-peen recognition. Higher stats altogether will bring in more players altogether. As of right now, asides from masturbation purposes, there isn't really an incentive to go flawless or deal with sweaty apes.",4,1585418388,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqp1j9/my_thoughts_on_how_to_fix_trials/,DestinyTheGame,0

fqozyb,DeerTrivia,Optimized Bounties For 3/28/2020,"Deer trivia: Lots of deer mark their territory with their urine and feces. But brocket deer are also known to mark territory with tears. They literally cry out their borders. 
___________________________________

**Step 1** - Cut some onions around brocket deer to really fuck with their social order.

**Step 2** - Pick up the following Dailies. [Weeklies can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq2chr/optimized_bounties_for_3272020/)
 
**Tower Bounties**:
 
- Zavala Daily – Horseshoes and Hand Grenades – 20 Grenade Kills
- Zavala Daily – The Harder They Fall – Kill 10 Challenging Enemies in Strikes
- Zavala Daily – Vanguardian – Kill 50 Enemies in Strikes
- Zavala Daily – Show Them The Light – 5 Super Kills in Strikes
- Shaxx Daily – By the Code – 10 Kills in Crucible
- Shaxx Daily – High Energy – 5 Energy Weapon Kills in Crucible
- Shaxx Daily – Into the Light – 1 Super Kill in Crucible
- Shaxx Daily – Lock It Down – Win 1 Round of Lockdown

**Planetaries**

- Rasputin – Rotating Patrols – Complete Mars, Titan, or Moon Patrols/Play Matches in Crucible 4v4 Rotator Playlist
- Rasputin – Sub Hive – Kill Hive/SMG Kills in Crucible
- Rasputin – Power Vex Breechloader – Kill Powerful Vex/Breechloader Grenade Launcher Kills in Crucible
- Rasputin – Rocket Vex – Kill a Vex Boss/Rocket Launcher Kills in Crucible

- Failsafe – Super Awesome – 3 Super Multikills on Nessus
- Failsafe – Friend or Foe – Kill 30 Fallen on Nessus
- Failsafe – Public Performance – Complete 2 Public Events on Nessus

**Step 3** - Follow these steps:

1. Fly TO THE MOOOOOOOOON to grab Eris and Rasputin’s bounties. Then head to the Anchor of Light and complete 3 Patrols while murdering Fallen. Once both are done, head to the Vex Gate in the Lunar Battlegrounds and slay out until you kill the boss. Then run the Scarlet Keep Strike. You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for a good set of Zavala Strike bounties and a Hive Kill bounty to recommend this Strike. I adore this Strike. (25 minutes)
2. Play one Lockdown Match. (10 minutes)
3. Fly to Nessus, grab Failsafe’s bounties, then run two Public Events; one Vex, one Fallen. (10-15 minutes)

**Total Non-Elemental Non-Weapon-Specific Bounties Cleared:** 

-	17 Dailies

**Total Time:** 45-50 minutes

**Rewards**:

- If you run Solar weapons/subclasses, Titan is easy today.
- If you run Arc weapons/subclasses, EDZ is easy today.",4,1585418260,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqozyb/optimized_bounties_for_3282020/,DestinyTheGame,4

fqoymv,Flash_Hunter,How to fix Trials fast and easy,"Skill Creep is already happening, in the weeks to come this playlist and mode will be as dead as Trials of the Nine.

Bungie can do 2 things right now to bring back the playerbase. Casuals and average players quit because its pointless unrewarding, waste of time and unfun getting farmed by stack clans and streamers. 

First add a Freelance mode with solo queue only. Much like in Comp this brought in a bunch of new players and many reached Legend no longer being gatekeeped by tryhards and pros. This is the Number #1 and probably the only thing to bring casuals/majority playerbase base back to Trials. Knowing that when you queue you are all solos on equal footing and not facing a sweaty 3 stack used to playing all day together.  

Now people object saying Trials is a Pinnacle PVP activity but I disagree if you pull flawless with different randoms 7 times that is damn impressive.  If people want to play in an esports style game mode facing best of the beat then setup a tournament. 

In the end who cares if there is a Freelance mode? Teams can still face teams and solos and play on their own terms and time.

Second the loot dispensing needs a rework. At 3-5-7 wins you get a random Trials engram now instead that can have any piece of Trials loot armor or weapon in it at random. 

Flawless lets you pick a weapon or armor randomly rolled of your choice once per week. Its Masterworked and guaranteed 70+ stat. Subsequent Flawless gives 2 random loot from chest. 

Adept Weapon added one per season. Curated roll like a spiritual successor to Ritual/Pinnacle weapon.  Flawless reward.

Ornaments added to armor for completing triumphs and badge/seal. Light Breaker and Light Maker theme is expanded on. The glows and ornaments look badass with more red or yellow design.",8,1585418146,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqoymv/how_to_fix_trials_fast_and_easy/,DestinyTheGame,2

fqouuh,ImJustStatingFax,"Making Adept gear for Flawless chest, and making normal Trials gear obtainable through pinnacle like quests will fix the skill creep IMO.","Adept gear, same design, same look. Just a unique perk (Maybe snapshot?) or ability that's gonna make the players go for Flawless. (Also guaranteed 60+ Statroll)

And to stop the casual base from decreasing, treat the normal gear like the Crucible Pinnacle rewards, where you have to reach a certain amount of kills with the same weapon class you are grinding for, and reaching a certain amount of wins.   
Or if you dont like the pinnacle like quest treatment, just let the normal Trials gear be obtainable through winning games on a card.

This imo, will fix the skill creep without losing the point of trials Trials being the PvP endgame activity where you try hard for special rewards at Flawless.

I still play comp with pleasure it's just the trials matchmaking that isn't worth my nerves anymore.
Have you/your friends given up on trials as well? Do we have some numbers of the people playing trials across these weeks? I'd be very surprised to see numbers going up. The general feeling I'm sensing is that people don't want to go through that frustrating experience for the rest of the season.

In my modest opinion Trials was necessary to bring back but I wasn't really desperate for it. I mean I definitely wouldn't consider it the core of an entire season. More like a nice to have for the sweaty tryhard PvP players. This season seems a bit empty.

fqnl69,Delilah_the_PK,Exotic riddles from Destiny 1,"Hello Destiny players, I wish to share with you something from my days among you. Normally i'm not one to worry about this franchise much anymore, but finding an old text file inspired me to share this with you.

The name of the game is simple: which riddle pertains to which exotic from destiny 1?

-

Though I stand alone, I fight as many. As I fly, I howl....with my pack behind me.

-


Brothers! Sisters! Rally behind me, fight with me and let my howl strengthen your resolve!
Howl my brethren, howl in pride as we race to victory!

-

Though I stand alone, I remain strong
My brother stands at the front, commands the pack.
I sit upon my throne, and command in solitude.

-

Like thunder, my hooves strike the dirt. I am swift, I am strong, and once I am upon you, I will take your life....for I am death.

-

With a twirl, my finesse is laid bear. With my hammer, i strike. I stand side by side with my rival, yet stand against him as well. He speaks first....what does that say bout me?

-

With wickedness, my power is laid bear. I pierce your heart with my power. I stand side by side with my rival, yet stand against him as well. I speak first....as that is all I need to let you wilt....

-

Bingo! Luck is a rarity now a days, especially that number 3 fellow...god what an amazing number....its like a silver platter full of goodies.....god i love that number.

-

Boom....headshot, body shot....its all the same.
Frozen life shatters within my fire.

-

Don't let them see me, it could mean the difference between your survival and death. Let your aim be true, but don't forget about my sights.

-

Infinity....darkness.....fire my master, fire into eternity....

-

Like raging beast I roar, pursuing you around every corner. Though I am weak, I will rebound and hit you twice as hard as before.

-

I am fragile, easily shattered.
Broken beyond my time.
Ripped from space, traveling through fire....
Simply to show that....

-

In the eyes of my master, I am the perfect weapon, in the eyes of his apprentice, I am worthless and slow.
With visions of old, hunting the wild, I stand tall and glistening in gold.

-

Flames, strength untapped, power unfound.
I stand above he who stands atop the sky, yet no on can see it....my power lingering, my strength smoking with desire, I stand tallest....against all.

-

I speak.
I chatter.
My masters broken, battered.
Into infinity I fire, burning away things that have no form.
Though if I hit, infinity shall be diminished.

-

Two sights, one shot.
By length of distance both short and long.
I break the world, with arrows of strength and resolve.

-

A pact made by those who are worthless, the lowest of the low. With weakness comes strength, with weakness comes unsuspecting power....misjudge my thunder, and suffer a fools death....

-

My purpose is many and with
Many a purpose....I keep you swift on your toes.
Point A, point B? Doesn't matter as long as you have right tool for the job.

-

I am sought after, and i seek you. Nothing hides, nothing runs. I am brutal but gentle.
Spiteful yet kind. I chase to the ends of creation, because that is where I am easiest to find.

-


I exist as but one, in a stranger's hand.
I exist as the destiny of one who wields me, but the desire of the idiots who pursue me.
I am lusted for, yearned for....yet only one of me remains.

-

The light....it withers....deep beneath the bowels of hell, I gestated in thunder....exploding outward towards my prey, destroying them from within. I have changed.....changed to devour you....

-

You are nothing, worthless....a horrid putrid mass of wasted breath. I despise you and everything you are.....burn in hell you miserable wretch.

-

Don't forget about me.....my lightning shoots faster, but only as a the third strategic algorithm.

-

Burning desire wanes as I fire....repeatedly my power enters your being....with unlimited minds, my body remains whole, while you fade away.

-


Aim true, but dont over estimate my range...others surpass but none can match me, because i have many many uses....just don't touch that dial.

-

They said to terminate me....they said to exterminate me, iv killed so many of you....guess thats why....so explain why I help you survive by extermination?

-

Lost.
Broken.
Forgotten.
My power was absolute, as I sat upon my throne, reveling in my reign.
My dominion long forgetting how my power grew when my life was split down the center....now I bask in nothingness, a former king, stripped of my crown....

-

Left! Left!
Right jab!
Thats it master, beat them with the fists you wield, show them our combined might.
If by chance we fall, pummel their corpse in retribution.

-

One drinks the void.
One cuts the light.
One expels thunder.
We slice the air, with different purposes....but shadows alone cannot compare.

-

Slumber.....slumber....never wake. Let's dream of flames that bounce from one reality to the next. His withered mind helped you find me....now my stimulation helps you confide me.

-

With a twirl, my finesse is brought forward. My eyes watch you as a teacher does children. My brother fires true, but only upfront. My power strikes true.....but only away from the front.

-

With a twirl, my finesse is brought forth. Born was i from they who robbed the vault. Stolen from my time, I explode with new power....one question.... Do you hold the right hand?

-

With a slow spin, my age is laid bare. Old and withered....my son has replaced me, speaking last.
My name is long forgotten, as was my master.

-

With each shot, 3 strikes, my body is revived. My place was long sought for, only to be forgotten as my power was diminished. My spool, died black, has returned....with renewed strength!


-
These basically require intricate knowledge of destiny 1's exotics and their lore. Hell, some of you might even vaguely recognize these riddles from when i posted them on the destiny forums several years ago.

fqnjn6,ANTORICO2THELEGEND,Don't sleep on Vigilance Wing for Widow's Court (or any ranged map),"I see a lot of people struggling in Widow's cuz it plays... weird. Especially after Anomaly.

You can be aggressive, but need a coordinated push. It's very easy to get flanked and get separated from your team due to the size of the map.

It seems you have two options:

A: Stick with HCs/Shotguns, maybe have a sniper to get a pick and then collapse on the enemy team. The shotgunners are most likely hunters or titans, with the sniper being a warlock


B: You swap to long range options. Could be a revoker, long ranged pulse rifle such as Bygones or Sacred Provenance. Maybe Randy's Throwing Knife, or a bow.

Or do you?

Introducing, the Vigilance Wing. you know, that one pulse rifle that reminded you of D1 and Trials of Osiris during the mess that was D2Y1 and Trials of the Nine.

A unique 5 burst gun, here's why its a good pick for Trials, especially for this map

Optimal Time to Kill: 0.77s. Faster than 150 RPM HC, and it kills in 9 shots. 100 crit accuracy not needed either; 7 crits and 2 bodyshots will do the job. Bodyshot optimal TTK ain't bad either: 1.2s. The same as a 4 shot 150 RPM. 

The faster TTK helps in clutches and fighting Adaptive Autos, especially Suros Regime Spinning Up

64 Range Stat. You won't be spining people like a max range Sacred Provenance, but you'll be at 20m - 35m. Keep in mind thta as long as you do 20 to the head, you can 2 burst.

But the real treat is its exotic perks. Let's take a look:

Harsh Truths: This weapon fires a 5-round burst. **When a nearby ally is killed, gain health regeneration and increased movement speed.**

This perk is amazing at setting up clutches, more so if you were ambushed and need to do clean ups. Instant health regen and better movement to strafe/run away/catch up is always helpful.

It's second perk, is also a treat:

Last Stand: Improved weapon performance and greatly increased recovery when **its wielder is the last living member of a fireteam.**

Along with movement speed bonus, instant health regen, you also get a big boost to recovery and weapon performance. 

I havent been able to test Last Stand, and i can't for the life of me find info on this perk, but this is what Last Hope seems to do to weapon performance

- Recoil Direction/Small stability buff
- Handling Buff
- Hip Fire Buff
- Longer slide distance (kneepads?)

Maybe faster reload, but i don't remember if I had a reload pulse rifle mod equipped while doing trials.

EDIT: Forgot to mention, since shotguns and pulse rifles use arc mods, you can use powerful friends too. I have a very strong gear build that gives me amazing stats with enhanced pulse rifle targeting and unflinching, and shotgun targeting. Also, you only need one arc mod to trigger multiple copies of powerful friends since its bugged, at least i think they havent fixed it yet

What my team would do: we have two hunters with shotguns (me and my friend, i had vigilance, he had spare) while my warlock friend with revoker would usually flank while sniping with Heat Rises (top tree dawnblade)

A too common example: Our team spawns next to Shore. Enemy team takes control of Plaza, looking into Courtyard/the middle between Church and Rubble

Our sniper would flank through Shore, then Base, all the way to district with a sword out and a radar booster to make sure the enemy team wouldn't spot him. Then, when we were ready, he would take a pick and a quick clean up would follow. If my teammate got shotgunned (he rushed in first, since i had the range advantage for clean ups) i would get all the aforementioned benefits and would rush with my Pulse or Mindbenders, depending on the situation

Good luck in trials. Got the feeling next week is Cauldron

fqnhrf,one_sleepy_guy,Should I get back into Destiny?,"So for background I was introduced to D1 by a friend (who had played since the beta) and got the game around the time Crota's End was released. I immediately became a fan and played it religiously through it's lifespan. When D2 was released I played through story missions, strikes, and all the other early content it had to offer, but I just couldn't get into the rhythm that I had with D1. I started playing it less and less, and by the time the expansions rolled around, I wasn't really playing at all. When forsaken was released I logged back on to play through the story missions and some of the new solo player events but that was it. Lately I've been kinda getting back into the loop of destiny content and have been missing the game, but I'm not sure if I want to play again  The biggest things that have kept me from going back are:

-getting a fireteam. Even since D1, I've never really had a dedicated fireteam to do raids and stuff with. Most of the raids I got done were through an lfg.

-the state of new content. I know a lot of people have complaints with the current state of the game. And though I'm mostly out of the loop with it, it doesn't feel like a great time to come back.

-the price tag. I don't know if I feel like paying $30 for shadowkeep. Especially since I don't know if I'll be back for good.

-the space. This is a minor issurle, but currently I have D2 for the PS4, and my PS4 has garbage storage space. Destiny is a meaty game, and it would be a hassle to reinstall it.

-the platform. Another issue with having it for ps4, is that it seems that there has been a general shift over to pc. I wouldn't be against getting the game for PC but that would mean paying for forsaken again and I'm broke af.



So what do I do guys? Currently what I'm thinking is just playing it on my PS4 without getting any new expansions and just seeing how I feel, maybe wait for the expansions to go on sale on PC. But that doesn't solve all of my issues. The main question I wanted answered from the community is, is the game worth getting back into right now?



Tl;Dr I long-windedly explain that I haven't played destiny 2 since early forsaken and want to know if it's worth getting back into either on PS4 or switching over to PC.",6,1585413395,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqnhrf/should_i_get_back_into_destiny/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqn9uu,deathangel539,Seventh Sereph weapon rolls are awful,"I get that bungie are going to be giving weapons a shelf life, but this is absurd and if this is going to become the new weapon standard then what’s the point? 

Just compare the Sidearm to another 360 - the anonymous autumn, not only does this have the ability to roll high cal and ricochet, the base stats are all higher than the sidearm, so what’s the actual point in having the new one? I get they’re trying to curb power creep, but this is just like the polar opposite, the weapons aren’t even the same they’re just flat out worse, the HC has the lowest base range stat of any legendary hand cannon I’ve ever seen, what’s the point? 

At least make the weapons on par with prior weapons otherwise there’s no point. 

To add, it’d be nice if, since 180’s are never used in PvE or PvP as they need a buff, they would either not give us a 180 that’ll see use, or try to give them a purpose. 

I don’t even know why I’m bothering to level up these bunkers since the rewards are just so lacklustre, I probably shouldn’t have bought this season in honesty, but hey trials I guess. 

Also for anyone who may say that they need to do this, all the trials weapons have amazing stats and the perk rolls are much less diluted of terrible perks, thus lowering RNG, those weapons are good and desirable for reasons other than looking really cool, so we get a set of good weapons and a set of really shit ones, like wtf?",13,1585412656,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqn9uu/seventh_sereph_weapon_rolls_are_awful/,DestinyTheGame,2
fqn9fe,GlobalPhreak,"Bungie: Don't sunset the old guns, give me a REASON to use the new guns.","From Luke Smith's Director's Cut:

[https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48758)

""It’s hard to cleave out that space in the current version of Destiny 2.  Weapons that are supposed to come from pinnacle activities like Raids or  Trials don’t really have space to breathe. \*\*The answer can’t be “Just  make them *better,*”\*\* because that approach ends up with the Reckoning situation I described last year.""

Here's the problem with that line of thinking... I updated the Moon Bunker to tier 3 and ran the Sidearm bounty. 

I then took my spandy new Sidearm and compared it to the others sitting around in my vault:

[https://i.imgur.com/vuTRsc4.png](https://i.imgur.com/vuTRsc4.png)

Why on earth is this anything other than an instant shard? The only gun it would replace would be the Vestian Dynasty, which TBH, I had to pull from collections for this comparison as I already ditched it. 

Yeah, yeah, I know, ""Warmind Cells"", but that option is just for a CHANCE to drop a cell, while my Last Dance with Full Auto and Dragonfly has a similar effect ALL the time. Plus there's a better option for generating them with Arc Abilities. 

The shotgun is similar, stats-wise it's better than Wishbringer or Ikelos, but both of those have a better rounds per minute and magazine size. Still no reason to choose it over Retold Tale or, hell, even Good Bone Structure has better impact and range. 

So, please, don't make old guns become useless without giving us a good reason to use the new guns. Otherwise what's going to happen is the newer guns will just get crappier and crappier because you're scared of power creep.",191,1585412616,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqn9fe/bungie_dont_sunset_the_old_guns_give_me_a_reason/,DestinyTheGame,4

fqmvby,ItsExoticChaos,"Why aren’t there 2 separate sandboxes, one for PvE, one for PvP?","This is a question I’ve always wondered when it comes to the idea of balancing weapons, and pretty much everything else in Destiny for that matter. Now I have a very rough grasp on programming, so I don’t know how difficult of a task it would be to have split sandboxes, but I know that the problem with balancing in Destiny is trying to find the sweet spot where weapons are not going to decimate in PvP, but also won’t be a pea shooter in PvE. 

We’ve seen a lot of nerfs over the years that have turned our favorite weapons into paper weights. I’m sure lots of people agree with my view of having the ability to smack god in the face with this overpowered weapon than be confined to fair. 

I remember reading an article back when Borderlands 2 came out, and one of the devs said something along the lines of 

“we were debating on how we wanted to make the gunslinger work. Would it be fair to let him duel wield 2 rocket launchers? Probably not. But would it be awesome as f***? Hell yeah it would! So we went the more fun route. Cause that’s what games are about.”

That’s kinda stuck with me over the years about how balancing in games should be handled. Unless you’re looking at a competitive field, do whatever will make the game the most fun.

I am not saying they aren't trash, I am just curious because I never felt like they are trash (yet)

Again, this is genuine curiosity, I get that they got nerfed recently so they used to be better but some posts make it sound like they are useless, especially snipers.

I mean, if they are trash, is it better for me, as a new player, to find better weapon types so I can get used to that weapon type, so they can carry me through late game stuff?",51,1585410944,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqmqmx/new_player_i_really_love_hand_cannons_and_sniper/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqmnvb,Fareo,"I'd really like to run Le Monarque but, everything has champions now so I end up using something with Anti Barrier instead. I'm sure you have a favorite exotic lost to the champion mods too. How can we fix this?","Here's just a couple off the top of my head. I'll edit some in if they get enough traction.

*Should champion mods be armor mods?* 

This way you could have Anti Barrier Energy or Overload Heavy. Make them class item mods that cost 6 so that you have to choose? You could still run multiple by running a mod and say Erianas Vow.

*Should all guns get a seasonal champion mod slot, including exotics?:* 

This way if it's a hand cannon season we could slot unstoppable on Ace of Spades? Or Overload on Lumina? Also if Legendary weapons had a seasonal mod slot you could still run Icarus or rampage spec while being appropriately prepared for the activity.

---

These are just a couple ideas, what do you guys think the best way to keep champion mods interesting but, also keep your loadout interesting. Even if Bungie wants us to use new exotics, Tommy's and Symmetry don't have a champion mod. So that idea is out the window.

fqmb62,ImJustStatingFax,"Bungie, can you stop bringing/making WAY too open or WAY to closed maps for Crucible?","Every map should have 50% of both. Something like Anomaly which is closed is like 90% Indoors, most of the gunfights happen there, there is literally no verticality when it comes to movement and shotguns dominated there. Then the very next map was Widow's Court, a really open map consisiting of only Church a close range place. The map is just too open that it is hard to close gaps, and people can just abuse guns such as Revoker and Hardlight, forcing the other team to use same annoying loadout.   


My point is, maps such as Javelin, Endless Vale, The Deadcliffs, have all kind of lanes, close and open and everything can work there. Rather than either just hardscope at the back style, or ape only style.   
Maps should NEVER enforce a playstyle on you, they should include a balance of all playstyles. That's why only few maps are allowed in scrims. Because these maps are balanced between lanes and close ranges.    


When you bring back a map from D1 or make a new map, please, for the love of god, don't enforce a loadout of a player. Make the map balanced. Asylum from D1 for example.

fqm1tq,GeminiTrash1,Making Destiny Free to play was likely the worst decision Bungie could've for PC. Cheaters have ruined it.,"TO ADDRESS THE TITLE

  It's become apparent that many cheaters running numbered tags have started popping up all over on the PC platform.  The free to play gimmick has exasperated this issue, as these cheaters have little more to do than to create a bunch of smurf accounts and after a ban can hop right back in to Destiny as they were in minutes.  On console it doesn't seem to be as big of an issue as for Xbox and PS there is an Online Service Fee.  Free to play needs to go away

THE ONE FOR THE NEW LIGHTS! 
  
  For the New Light Players who join when free to play began,  Bungie I think you should honor the time they've invested into your game and allow them the permissions to play Destiny as they have been.  This way any players who've participated and didn't cheat may still enjoy destiny,  but make the sack of shits who make smurf accounts to keep their cheating spree going pay to continue playing Destiny.  

 I just wanted to give this feedback.  If there are any who'd like to discuss the topic or the solutions I've come up with feel free to open up in the comments.",2,1585408675,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqm1tq/making_destiny_free_to_play_was_likely_the_worst/,DestinyTheGame,1

Some exotics might even see more use if this was implemented. And for weapons that get multiple options for Anti-Champion mods, they could just assign them randomly or pick what gets what.

fqlodx,cristianp2103,I just don’t understand why when Bungie is struggling to produce enough content they spend so much time on Eververse.,"Bungie has been saying that we can’t expect them to make as much content and loot as we would like because they care about their mental health and also don’t have enough resources. Fair. But why, then, does so much effort go to Eververse? 

Let’s talk about the armor:
1. It’s usually pretty damn good looking.
2. TWO sets of NEW DESIGNS per SEASON!!!
3. Both designs become unobtainable at the end of the season.
4. Meanwhile, Crucible armor is the same design as Vanilla D2 (3 years ago), Iron Banner armor is the same design as two years ago, Vanguard is the same design as Vanilla D2 (3 years ago), Gambit hasn’t changed in a year and a half, trials armor is all from D1 so at least 4 years ago, and Garden if Salvation gear was a re-skin.
5. If Bungie used these two sets for vendor refreshes, it would take 3 seasons (under a year) to create an entirely new loot pool of armor, trials and raids included.

Weapons:
Ok these r all re-skins but whatever that’s not gonna change we’ve been complaining about that since vanilla D2 :(

Ghost shells, ships, and sparrows:
Oh boy. Here’s where I get really pissed off.
1. You can only get exotic ghost shells, ships, and sparrows from Eververse. (Except a few exceptions in year 1).
2. MOST THEMED shells, ships, and sparrows REMAIN in Eververse. 
3. Usually, rewards for in-game activities look like normal ass legendary ghosts, ships, and sparrows, with many times a perfect-looking alternative locked behind Tess Everis.
4. Personally, I think exotic shells, ships, sparrows, and honestly emotes should only be earned through gameplay. Why do PINNACLE ACTIVITIES give you a LESSER COSMETIC REWARD to flaunt??? What if the legendaries stayed with Eververse, but those beautiful yellow exotics could only be earned. Now that’s what you call incentive.

I’d like to say one thing before I go: If Eververse is really that necessary, we need more transparency from Bungie. Otherwise, it just feels like we’re getting told that us dedicated and veteran players are being cared for when in reality it’s the F2P quick microtransaction audience that’s being prioritized.

TL;DR: So much of the content being used for Eververse could be used to give us the gear and incentive we’re dying for. We miss the days of D1 where there was so much more to earn.",12,1585407456,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqlodx/i_just_dont_understand_why_when_bungie_is/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqkez7,Shyfi_,"My shitty raid team, please, god, help me out","So, me and a group of friends decided to start doing regular raids about a week ago. 3 of us are veterans who know what we're doing (1 of whom is an ex raid sherpa from D1), so we're fine.
But there's a few issues with the rest of the team.
The other 3 haven't done the raids before. So me and my 2 fellow veterans took them all into Eater of Worlds. It took us about 3 hours to complete what should have been 45 minutes. Based on that, I decided to do Leviathan, but this time, I was going to be taking notes on who messes up and why. We got it done in about 3 hours, same as EoW.
The main issues were: one has the attention span of a dog on bath salts, another refused to listen, insisting he knew best how to do the encounters, and the last one just seemed to die a lot.
Based on those issues, I switched around their roles as best I could, and we went into leviathan again.
The one with a bad attention span was originally running platforms at gauntlet and void room at Calus in the first run, the second time, we had him switched to running the gauntlet, and clearing the ad room.
Second guy still refused to listen to us so we did our best to work around him, which proved difficult.
Third guy was advised to change his setup to a high resilience build.
Overall, it worked out better and we got it done in 2 hours and 30 minutes give or take.
But we all want to do Garden of Salvation with this team (me and the 2 vets know the raid) and we're struggling to get the rest of the group ready for harder raids, especially since they struggle with some of the easiest. Is there any way we can get them to work better as a team so we can start doing more of the raids?

If this isn't fixed/removed soon you will need to rename trials to ""trials of hard light""
And here is a list of things I'd like to see in trials.

- weapons and armour from Bounty's.

Reason is that since the trials is riddled with ""no lifer"" we as casuals should have a chance to earn weapons and armour somehow. Like D1 trials.

- matchmaking is broken.

Reason is when my team start our 1st game of the card we face a team that is on there flawless game, target practice anyone?

A fix for this would be to make the teams that are on there flawless game actually face other teams that are on there flawless game.
And make the teams that have gone flawless make them face ONLY teams that have gone flawless or are continuing on the same flawless card.

fqjl1s,LysdexicIdiot,"Lumina's cool and all, but...","It needs something. Something to make it stand out. Bungie said they were adding harder roles with Shadowkeep, but there has been nothing on that since Lumina. I got its Catalyst playing PvP (Which sucked. Don't do that), and It feels off... for a gun made by a Guardian that ends Gods every year or so, it feels weak. It's whole shtick is to inspire hope, right? Well, when the blueberries are always running from me when all I wish to do is inspire them, it gets tedious and boring. I could shoot it down hallways and hope for the best, but that brings no guarantees. That, and it also feels like none of my shots hit. I've tried hand cannon targeting, and I've tried pacing my shots. It feels amazing and terrible to use all at the same time. The gun feels like it's been hyper-balanced. Thorn, Ace, TLW... they all feel great to use, and they're no slouches in most parts of the game. You could make the argument that it's not those guns. And I get that argument.

If Bungie is going to continue adding pointless content every season, and not new ""roles"", then what is  the point of this Hand Cannon? If you're a smart team, you're running bubble and well and a high DPS primary. Not Lumina.

And if you're a smart Crucible player, you're not typically running Lumina. (Some do, but they're the exception.)

So, I have made a few changes that bring it in line with the other Hand Cannons WHILE retaining its hopeful nature. I, by no means, think Bungie is going to change it. But I can hope for the best, right?

&amp;#x200B;

\- Noble Cause (Intrinsic): Kills with this weapon leave behind Remnants. Absorbing a Remnant reloads your magazine partially from reserves. You can ""bank"" three of these Remnants at a time, but they track you more aggressively within a larger radius now.

\- Chambered Compensator (Barrel)

\- Accurized Rounds (Magazine)

\- Embrace the Praxic Fire (Trait): Hold Square to absorb a remnant. The weapon now Burns Opponents and flinch is significantly reduced, but continuously burns you until you reload or stow the weapon. Enemies that are burned by your weapon do not drop Remnants. For every tick of damage that burns you and your enemies, all allies around you heal half that amount. (Like Tommy's Matchbook, the burn cannot kill you, but it will leave you vulnerable to pretty much anything.) 

\- Polymer Grip

Catalyst: +16 Range/+10 Stability. Can hold two more remnants (Five Total).

I want this weapon to be an uproarious thing, capable of bringing hope to an otherwise hopeless situation. Everyone's about to die in a raid encounter? Pop a Remnant. About to lose a control point to a marauding team? Pop a Remnant. It's very much a ""take one for the team"" philosophy with this redesign. You are weakening yourself and embracing the fire to save those around you. I want it to be a weapon where you plant your feet and never give an inch. In order to continue the healing, you have to be an aggressive, decisive player. A leader. Someone that doesn't back down from a difficult fight. 

That, and it's still counter to Thorn. Thorn is all about being the lone wolf. The Stalking Hunter. The Agent of the Deep that does nothing but take and take and take.

Lumina? It's about giving everything to help everyone around you. It's about being an Agent of the Sky, forever generous and giving. (The entire Remnant Philosophy about this weapon bothers me because you're taking from someone else, but I did the best with what I saw here.)

Any thoughts?

I want to bring this topic to the forefront because think it's really weird that D2 doesn't have a chat bubble system.

You can go right next to someone's face and type something in chat but it'll never show up as a chat bubble.

**It makes you not want to go and talk to other players even if you wanted to because you're probably not going to get a response if they aren't paying attention to the chat.**

**Can we please have more social features in the game ?** I know Bungie don't want an MMO and the game will never truly be massive (200+ people in the Tower, for example), but... man, just make it easier and more immersive to talk to others.

Let me know if you guys agree or disagree with this.",1,1585394398,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqibyz/i_would_like_to_see_chat_bubbles_ingame/,DestinyTheGame,1

True, it got replaced by Armor 2.0 but since ascendant shards are hard to get if you dont grind out master nightfalls or trials of osiris. So, I think that random armor rolls should be brought back into the game and it should be utilised with armor 2.0 so that you can use both versions and make your gear more valuable instead of having armor 2.0 look plain. 

Or, if you hate the idea of that, then remove or increase the elemental energy cap on armor from 10 to probably 20 or 25 so that we can have flexibility in customising the best loadout you can offer for your Guardian. The armor energy should be levelled up throughout playing all activities, but it shouldn't be too hardcore.",1,1585391457,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqhnkd/mix_forsaken_armor_rolls_with_armour_20_or/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqg6tl,Genashi1991,Will the story of Destiny 1 continue to be good and interesting? (I'm brand new to series)," I recently decided to try the demo and it seemed interesting but the thing is that I'm not really into playing FPS normally even less so trying to do it with a controller. And online games often feel like they are set up differently compared to the single player offline story based games.
 The gameplay loop aside, how is the game? I enjoyed the voiced parts but oftentimes there was text coming up that I didn't manage to read it before it went away. So it meant that sometimes I only knew where to go because of a marker on screen.
 Since story would be my focus missing things kind of ruins it a bit. I'm sure I might get into gameplay but it might take a while and the game is 60€ which is a bit steep since I'm uncertain.
 And as a side note if I'm not able to have people to play with can I finish the story to the end (if there is one) solo?

fqfqsn,Timsaurus,I like to brainstorm exotics in my spare time so here's a few I came up with.,"Thanks to [u/En-Zu](https://www.reddit.com/user/En-Zu/) for the inspiration with his 6 exotic challenge post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq0zoa/6\_exotic\_challenge/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq0zoa/6_exotic_challenge/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

I made these either because I was bored, or saw an empty space in the game I thought could fill with an exotic. I'm well aware that most of these have zero chance of actually being in Destiny for various reasons, that said I am open to constructive criticism if anyone has any.

# Weapons:

**Overcharge -** Arc Scout Rifle (Primary)

*""We've been studying that wrecked 'Zhalo' thing we found, turns out we can't fix it. But consider this the next best thing"" -Omolon technician*

**Exotic perk:** *Rolling Thunder-* Holding down the trigger causes each consecutive shot to deal slightly more damage than the last.

**Secondary Exotic perk:** *Superior Cells-* Critical hits cause lightning to chain to nearby enemies

**Specs:**

* Rapid Fire Frame (260rpm), 10 round mag, high recoil

**Visual description:** Omolon style scout with a side loading disk magazine

\_\_\_\_\_

**The Rainbow -** Kinetic Sidearm (Primary)

*""Some said it wasn't possible to use three experimental Hard Light cores and an old pistol to shred energy barriers, to them I say, 'Taste The Rainbow'"" -Unknown*

**Exotic perk:** *Spectrum-* Each bullet in a burst has a different energy type, Void, Solar, and Arc, respectively. Deals bonus damage to shields and decreased damage to health.

**Secondary Exotic perk:** *Fluidize-* This weapon detonates all shields, and upon detonation, enemy shields create pools of energy matching the shield element that increases damage of that type for you and your allies when standing in it.

**Specs:**

* Omolon Adaptive Frame (3-Round Burst)

**Visual description:** Extended barrel Omolon style sidearm with three clear Void, Solar and Arc colored weapon cores instead of the standard two batteries.

# Armor

(I'm a hunter main so I only really made hunter exotics, let me know if you'd like me to make some for other classes)

\_\_\_\_\_

**Cannonwalkers -** Hunter General Leg Armor

*""You should'a seen the look on his face when I took off... priceless...""*

**Perk: Cannonball-** Press \[air move\] while in air to launch you in the direction you're facing. Taking damage from falling creates an elemental damage explosion corresponding to your subclass.

\_\_\_\_\_

**Proxima Strides -** Hunter Solar Leg Armor

*""Tread carefully, for the next step you take may be your last""* 

**Perk: Proximity Planning-** Blade Barrage knives and Incendiary Grenades stick to surfaces and become proximity detonating traps. Extends active duration of Tripmine and Swarm Grenades. 

\_\_\_\_\_

**Heart Of Singularity -** Hunter Void Chest Armor

*""Keep 'em close to your heart, and they'll open theirs to you. Whether they like it or not""*

**Perk: Gravity Lapse-** Shadowshot arrows always activate instantly on impact, and pull all enemies within the tether's radius to the center on first activation. Increase the slow effect of smoke bombs.

\_\_\_\_\_

**Shadow's Grasp -** Hunter Void Arm Armor

*""To answer an age old question, the Void does not whisper back. It screams.""*

**Perk: Deafening Isolation-** Overcharge Vortex grenades while Smoke Bomb is charged to combine them into a Vortex Trap that sticks to enemies hit by it, and damages, blinds, and suppresses enemies within it's radius.

What would Season of Health be? Well, it would be a season where Bungie would not release any new content, and fix as much of the game as they could. Basically like Rainbow Six: Siege's ""Operation Health"". 

I know how easy it is to just say, ""Do what Ubisoft did with R6 Siege and take a season to fix the game."" There's loads of differences that would play into Bungie's ability to even do something like this, from the way they develop multiple things at a time, to how Destiny 2 is in a completely different genre where it's almost necessary to keep putting out content.

But I'm not here to talk about if Bungie would even be able to do this. I'm here to get different takes/opinions on this topic. Would you be *for*, or *against*, something like this? Do you think Bungie is doing an okay-enough job when it comes to fixing bugs? Do you think the game can benefit from a Season of Health? Do you think the game *needs* it?

I have been loving it in PvE, and wanted to really see the use in other ways. I use upgrade mods frequently cause i have all sorts of favorite guns i use, apart from upgrading some guns i need to use for rituals, and the likes. 

Finally ready, and now they lock it out because of the swap bug. I think if, and when they do this. They should immediately send everyone 1 upgrade mod. To use in place for this missing armor piece. So, that i can get a legendary or other exotic up to LL for this moment in time. I'm stupid low on rss, currently, and a free upgrade mod atm would be nice to keep current and not have to do stupid stuff to get back that missing LL.

fqfcpe,caelestihydr4,maybe the tips in loading screens should be a bit more interesting!,"i thought it was a great idea to have tips in the loading screen, especially for those who have long loading times like me who plays on console. 

however, i’m sure, along with myself, the community’s veterans and some of the new people really don’t enjoy the facts that are on display. 

all due respect, i know what dungeons there are. i know commander zavala will give me powerful gear if i turn in eight bounties a week. 

however, i’m not just here to complain. here is a solution i’m sure would spark the interest of people reading the facts. 

add little lore tabs! not entire stories or anything like that, just cute little facts like how lord shaxx had offered his hand in marriage to whoever got the vow or how commander zavala once fell in love with a mortal. they could be wholesome, dark, useful or even just provoking an “oh! i didn’t know that.” type reaction. 

or possibly some game tips! like the tip about the suppressor grenade was useful although a bit obvious. that’s on the right track! maybe delve a bit deeper into that, after all, you all made the game, you’re bound to know a bit more than that! 

continuing with lore, even things we didn’t know before, stuff that isn’t in the grimoire or the lore books. let’s say ikora and a random hunter are currently in the midst of an amusing prank battle. that’s not in the lore tab, but it’s not a huge lore breakthrough either.

fqf7c5,SirMushroomTheThird,We need to talk about Bungie not giving anything to players who bought the game before it became free.,"Now I don’t remember the exact details, but I’m pretty sure that when forsaken came out, there was some sort of CoO and warmind came free with it or something. To satisfy players who had previously bought these dlcs, Bungie gave them 2 exotic emotes, an emblem, a shader, and a bunch of eververse consumables. Now keep in mind that these 2 expansions were $30 and the players received all this stuff mentioned above. 

Now fast forward to New Light. This made the base game and all the year 1 expansions free, and made the annual pass free with forsaken. Keep in mind that if you bought all these expansions when they first came out, you would have spent over $100 (base game, year 1, and annual pass). Players have not received anything  to show they aren’t a new light player. I’m not saying that Bungie should have given all these people a ton of stuff or a refund or something, but come on. You spend all this time in eververse, why can’t you spare players a single exclusive emote, or give them like 500 silver. 

I think that Tf2 did something like this when it became free to play. I do not play tf2, but I heard from a friend that they gave players who bought the game a ton of special perks and cosmetics. Now tf2 and destiny 2 are very different games but still, we should get something. And I think tf2 is 10 years old or something and still has a very large player base.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk



TL,DR: Bungie should give some cosmetic or something to the players who bought the expansions that are now free, similar to the Veterans of the Hunt bundle that was given to players who played pre forsaken.",7,1585378612,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqf7c5/we_need_to_talk_about_bungie_not_giving_anything/,DestinyTheGame,1
fqf78p,LocalPleb,PC Destiny Players: Why does no one talk to each other? [New Player],"Hey guys,   


Apologizing in advance in case this isn't the right place to post this cause this is the only sub reddit I've found so far. I'm new to the game, and decided to try it out because it's free and covid-19. 

But why is it so dead? Why does no one use their mics? I've been playing for 4 days now, and no one chats to each other let alone types to each other. The crucible seem pretty team environment, but there's never any voice comm action like I get when I play Apex, CS:GO, etc. The chat is also always dead too? 

Do I have weird wrong settings or something cause this has been a pretty antisocial game from a beginner stand point. Am I too low level to be at the Hub where everyone else is? Is the Free version somehow tied to my isolated experience? haha 

I'm not complaining or anything cause most of the content is solo-able and is generally really fun, but I don't like Hive missions cause they creep me out and doing them alone really sucks. Plus the crucible is super, super fun, and I'm having a lot of success. Unfortunately the lack of team cohesiveness really puts a damper on objective base modes like Gambit and Control.   


Thanks for reading my shit-post!

fqf516,MasterChiefmas,(Long-ish) My silly theory of what the Guardians were before...,"Many years ago, back in the D1 days, when we were all theorizing a lot more about the back story of Destiny (because it was so incredibly incoherent then), I had the silly theory that the reason that Guardians are so rare, is that the quality that the Ghost had to find was a person of a particular persuasion 

Specifically, I thought that it'd be funny if it turned out that they had to be ethically/morally compromised in some way originally, if not quite outright murderers. I'm not a hardcore Lore person, but in the big picture view, it seems like it could fit.  

For instance, it would explain why the memories get mostly erased. You don't want them coming back and actually being that way, but maybe retain enough to be able to deal with constantly dying and resurrecting, and also being able to kill thousands and thousands of living creatures, very directly. Even other Guardians, over and over. There's a mental toll for all of that killing, so finding people that could manage it was a necessity.

This would also explain why Uldren (while he cares for his sister to an obsessive degree, I think he's largely amoral with regards to anything else) was suitable to be brought back as a Guardian, and also fits in with the recent Lore bits I read that someone else put together about Vance and the resonance thing. If the resonance caused the Guardian to become more of it's core, resonating with something that was already there and amplifying it, or just letting it be expressed to it's normal levels even, if we suppose that it is being repressed now. 

Most recently, this is the secret Vance is being warned off of stumbling on if he continues, that all the Guardians were, in their original lives, abnormal personalities, particularly of dangerous types, and what that might imply if the resonance were to revert/unleash many or all of the Guardians back to that original state. And the knowledge of that just getting out.

The only thing that didn't seem to fit, I seem to remember either a Lore entry, or a conversation from one of the NPCs, maybe Holliday, that seemed to be saying they believed everyone would get resurrected sooner or later. But it wasn't really definite that was a fact, more just a belief.

Of course, I don't really think the story would go this way...we always have to have Good Guy Nobility in our stories for this kind of setting. But it'd be kinda a neat direction I think too (much like the old theory we are actually the bad guys- which I thought was a neat one too). 

So, what did I miss/overlook in my data fitting?",6,1585378268,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqf516/longish_my_silly_theory_of_what_the_guardians/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqe34m,Sir-Shady,Stop Complaining About the State of the Game When it's YOUR Fault... And Some Weapon Retirement Comments,"I should preface this by saying I understand this will make me sound like a Bungie shill, but I'm not. I've given this game and its predecessor enough shit for me and the next guy, but if you read this and want to call me a shill or fanboy be my guest but I'm about to give you guys some very tough pills to swallow. 

&amp;#x200B;

The state of the game is the communities fault. That's it. That's the post. But I'll elaborate for everyone because this needs to be said. I think we can all agree that Destiny 1 was generally a tougher game. The bosses had more health, the quests were... quests, and the mechanics were generally a lot more engaging. It was more akin to what an actual MMORPG should be. With D2 everything started grindy simply because of the God-awful weapon system, but then with Forsaken and subsequently Shadowkeep, Bungie said they wanted to reward hardcore players and investment. With that, outrage ensued. People want hard content, Bungie says they'll make it, then people bitch and complain that they won't be able to obtain the best loot in the game. But news flash, this type of game is the type of game that rewards investment and SHOULD give the best rewards from stuff like Dungeons, Raids, and Trials. B U T.... The community complained to the point where Bungie thought that we just wanted loot to be thrown at us (Timelost Bounty Farm, Menagerie chest glitch (That they let stay up for months and even acknowledged it in a TWAB), previously extremely easy Master Nightfall runs, etc...). Now low and behold, people are complaining that the game is too easy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This will all come full circle so pay attention. When Bungie announced weapon retirement people got mad.... The Destiny community got mad? What?! Weapon retirement is very good for the game. Why you ask? Because then it allows for Bungie to make super powerful raid weapons, and super good gear you can only get by being the best of the best in either PvE or PvP. That will help bring challenge back into the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bungie listens to you. To US. We have more of a say in what happens to this game than anyone else. And people want it easy, then they want it to be difficult. I realize this post has been all over the place but this is what I really want to hammer in as my main point. This is a looter shooter. The whole idea of the game is to GRIND to get the good stuff. If you are not willing to put in the time to master something to get the best loot in the game for you, I don't mean to sound like an asshole but, find another game. The whole idea of the game is to reward investment and to grind, and since everything is so easy like we all asked for it to be, the loot in this LOOTER shooter doesn't feel special. Let Bungie add weapon retirement, let them make hard activities with amazing rewards, let them make their game in their vision before you jump down their throats. Trust me, you may not like the sound of actually trying for something in this game, but if you ever played D1 you know how nice it was to finally finish the Touch of Malice or exotic sword quests. You know how nice it was to beat a nightfall  and get the Gjallarhorn, or the Supercell (Yes I liked ye ole Zhalo). We're missing those moments in D2, and I don't know about you, but I want them back.",22,1585373162,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqe34m/stop_complaining_about_the_state_of_the_game_when/,DestinyTheGame,1

fqdyoa,i_forget_what_i_do,In the future please keep all Seasonal activities to matchmade instances. Loading into Anchor's Line 1000 times to try and get a group for the PE is the worst.,"The Seasonal activities for over the past couple years have been pretty great.  Blind Well and Escalation Protocol were good, but suffered heavily from spotty playercounts and frequent drop-in-drop-outs.  The Black Armory Forges solved this problem (for the most part) by being a matchmade activity, despite the shortcoming of loading players into solo Forges.  Reckoning offered fixes for both of these problems by being matchmade and having the first round be clearly easy enough to solo until more group members joined in.  Menagerie was the pinnacle of these activities being fully matchmade with a clear beginning, middle, and end.  Vex Offensive and the Sundial rode off the Menagerie's coattails but were decent over all and were rewarding enough, though it seems Bungie has taken a few steps back by making the Warmind Public Event an actual Public Event.  This brings up the same issues that Escalation Protocol and Blind Well had where there is always a VERY good chance that you just *don't* get a group when you load in.  It's very annoying to try and work your way around the map to try and load into different zones to get a populated PE.  I think it would be best if Bungie sticks to making them purely matchmade activities again, that way players can guarantee when they go to load into the activity that they will actually be able to do it at that time rather than 15-20 minutes in the future when they get a populated event space.",93,1585372586,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqdyoa/in_the_future_please_keep_all_seasonal_activities/,DestinyTheGame,1

The game type could be survival game type but the entire team only has one life. And hopefully a fireteam leaderboard. It would require you to have a full fireteam to participate in the event.

fqd0ae,RPColten,Catalyst Question: Tommy's Matchbook.,"So I just applied the catalyst to Tommy's Matchbook. I'm not sure what it does if it does anything.

The catalyst reads that it grants faster recovery while ""Ignition Trigger"" (the exotic trait) is active. ""Ignition Trigger"" is the exotic trait that overheats the weapon after 20 consecutive rounds were fired and increases damage at the expense of the wielders shields.

I was slapping around with it during a Moon patrol and I just can not figure out what exactly the bonus perk is doing. Firing it full stop to an empty mag is no different. Health/shields seem to regen at the same rate. Killing/damaging enemies doesn't seem to do anything. Health/shield recover armour perks, the ones tied to picking up Orbs of Light, don't appear to operate any differently. There aren't any apparent stat improvements. The only thing I feel I haven't tested is *health* recovery, but I'm doubtful it would be any different than shield recovery.

I'm just hoping someone else here has more evidence to suggest what it does because I'm at a loss.",4,1585368446,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fqd0ae/catalyst_question_tommys_matchbook/,DestinyTheGame,1

I think this could be made better by someone (maybe Banshee?) giving out repeatable bounties that are weapon specific that look at your collection and gives you a bounty to get kills with a certain legendary or exotic weapon. Because although the types of weapon bounties does somewhat force me to go out of my comfort zone, I will usually only end up using one gun of each type when I get that bounty and I think making it so that they are weapon specific would give me an excuse to use weapons I want to use but that just aren’t as good as others.

Also kind of along the same lines, I want a catalyst for every exotic. It doesn’t even have to do anything other than boost some stats or increase mag or whatever.

fqcnvp,Sleazy_P_Martini_,"Another post about Solstice armor ornaments/glows, a new direction?","So, a couple things have led me to this line of thought, which i feel like is a good compromise to give us our beloved and hard earned Solstice gear back. 

- The old Crucible sets have been renewed, and they accept the old ornaments from Y1
- The faction sets are back, and they also accept the Y1 ornaments
- The D1 Trials sets came back, and they accept ornaments from the Y1 Trials of the Nine set, which was a totally different armor set, not sure if the models matter in terms of accepting ornaments, but just something i wanted to note in case it is relevant 🤷🏼‍♀️

Those recent things have led me to this proposal; the parade sets have been added into the world loot pool, they are the base sets that Solstice armor is based on. The blue versions of the solstice armor are just the parade sets without the class specific flavors applied to them (meaning the lion, snake, or eagle). When looking at the Solstice armor, the green and blue versions can be selected as ornaments. If we can’t re-obtain/re-roll our Solstice armor, maybe give us the different tiers of Solstice armor (green, blue, and purple) and the glows (if you own them) to use as specific ornaments on the parade armor? I worked hard for the armor, paid for the glows (TWICE, because i’m a sucker and bought them in Y1 and Y2), and i love the sets. I want to keep using them, i feel like those sets would be the best way to ornament them and let us use them if Bungie isn’t going to give the sets the universal ornament treatment. I don’t know how difficult it would be to implement that, but it doesn’t seem to me like it’d be too insane to do. 🤷🏼‍♀️

I can't figure out how to actually submit a help ticket to Bungie, so I'm posting here in hopes that someone can help me.

I tried going back into orbit, clearing the Steam cache, and even visiting the postmaster as I saw suggested in another thread here.  None of it helped.

Second: The game is not bad
Third: their decisions are weird

I LOVE the game and have for a while but it seems the game is turning into a cash farm rather than an enjoyable experience. This is not some rant over the while ""d2 in pay to win"" idea, but the decisions they make frustrate me to no end.

1. Trials 
In d1, trials was something that attracted both casual and sweats pretty easily based on a bounty system that allowed both to coexist pretty easily. The casuals were carried by the sweats and stomped but the bounties made sure that this was not a reacurring thing.
Despite the great look trials had and the great harmony between both sweats and casuals, d1 had came to a end when d2 was released. Fast forward after trials of the nine and the original trials is revealed to make a return. The backstory is needed to set a clear picture of what trials was and should be. 

Dispite it's incredible backround d2(bungie) was not kind to trials. Where the loot system in d1 was flexible and offered a abundance of loot d2 is a different story. The loot you get consists of old armor and weapons from d1. This basically leans on a nostalgic factor for d1 vets and sounds fine in concept for any other game type but trials......TRIALS....remember d2 make a a@# ton of money, they made new rituals and new IB armor, and a cash shop that has better development than that the entire game.

It has been universally agreed upon that this will happen in Trials at some point, as the reward structure does not encourage participation from casual players and does not encourage the best players to persist with their cards until they are flawless.

The thing is- I think that the skill creep is already here. I am eager to see the number of flawless this week as, based on personal experience and even the experience of some of the best players on Twitch, flawless is as difficult as it's ever been in D1 or D2.

It's week 3, and we're already here. Either there is some kind of SBMM being implemented, or only good players are left in Trials. The time for an overhaul to the reward system isn't 6 months from now, or 3 seasons from now- it's right now.

fqblci,externalmemory,10 Miscellaneous Character Gear page Info / Quality of Life Suggestions,"Everybody loves a little listicle clickbait, so here's a little QoL suggestion listicle for the Character Gear page.

TL;DR: Most of these are for the sake of saving players precious time loading stat grids and asset previews on gear just to see what gear it is and what it's got (not its model, perk effects on stats, appearance etc.). Putting more info available on the main grid to pull up as needed. Just do that and it's golden.  
\*terms - ""mini grid"" is the little gray squares next to the slot icons, ""slot grid"" is when those grids expand to show the gear icons, when hovering over gear in that slot\*

The mini-grid next to equipped items could show better info at a glance. here's some simple designs to do that:  


1. mini-grid squares color coded by rarity instead of simply being gray
2. highlight gear on mini-grid inventory grid that is best power in slot in current inventory (and double - highlight maximum power weapons /armor across all inventories-vault postmaster etc etc)

The Hold L2 Gear Stats function could see a bunch of time-saving upgrades:  


1. Armor: The top left corner icon on the slot grid should be which season slot is on the base armor, not the ornament, so it's more clear which season mod slot if any is on the armor without having to check the armor's true name by hovering over (currently shows season source of whatever ornament is equipped if not base appearance). For Gambit Prime armor, this would be the Prime class icon instead (doesn't have season mod but grants unique set bonus all the same)
2. Armor: next to the elemental affinity icon on slot grid, there's room to display energy used out of total (ex: 4/6 \*solar icon\*)
3. Armor: below the affinity icon on slot grid, displaying the number of mod slots (3 or 4) and whether they're empty or full. This info combined with the season mod slot icon update would show players at a glance which armors have which season slot if any, not to mention which armor was modded and therefore likely in use before
4. Weapons: Similar to energy slot total / max, the MW level of the weapon could be displayed on the icon as well as an icon denoting which masterwork stat is on the weapon (10 possible icons).  This info is not even available on cursor-over if the stat's not been upgraded, not to mention on the slot grid in general.  

5. Weapons: Cursor-over: Full / Expanded perk display: some perks in some columns show up on cursor-over but definitely not all of them, and which ones show up is inconsistent. Instead, show the current perk on each column (most have 4 columns max for a total of 5 including equipped mod. If possible, showing the \*icons\* of alternate perks for each column next to the current perk name would be a huge help.
6. Ghosts: Not a huge deal but might as well. Just naming what destination the detectors are on would be a fine improvement, but \*perfection\* would be all 3 perk icons showing up on L2 hold as well. With appropriate tweaks to the existing perk icons so that each unique perk has a unique icon or mini-icon. Don't gotta go digging for that Crucible XP log + Crucible Scanner ghost anymore!

Equipped Base Power level versus Total Power Level versus Max Power Level

1. It's surely been said before but displaying somewhere the Max power level for our characters ingame would be a big help. An elegant solution given the artifact bonus would be, when holding L2 on the power level, to show the total current vs. total max.  
Like this, for example: 1011 / 1021 and under that, 1000 / 1010 + 11 for the current gear / max gear + bonus breakdown
2. Likewise the tooltip could read ""\*\*1011\*\* / 1021 max"" and under that, ""1000 current / 1010 max gear +11 bonus"". The description should make note that Max Gear is an aggregate of highest power of highest power gear in all inventories, and that the power of dropped loot and gear rewards is calculated from this. Not sure of an elegant way to word that extra info, but I'm not a copywriter.

Every good map in modern PvP is copy pasted from Destiny 1, including the three trials maps so far. If Rusted lands is next week, then that marks every trials map.

It's not because I'm *garbage* at crucible, or because I'm getting out light-leveled. For context I have every crucible pinnacle save not forgotten (still working on the Luna's kills,) and have been 1000 LL for the past two weeks.

I am absolutely livid. Picture yourself forming a good squad for trials via LFG. You’ve won three games but as you load into your forth but disaster falls. You don’t load in and you are greeted with an error code. In this case, Error Code Rabbit. Due to stupid reasons you can’t rejoin your squad but it doesn’t matter. They play lights out and within without you. They have got 4 wins and mercy while you have 3 wins but no mercy. You figure you stick it out and go the rest of they way. You make it to game 7 for your teammates and everyone plays phenomenal. Your two teammates go to the lighthouse while you’re 6-0. They agree to play another match so that you can join them. 


And then you lose your game 7 and fall at the gates of lighthouse.


That is my frustrating tale. Never have I experienced Rabbit in recent months and it could not have picked a worse time.  I miss out on a flawless cause I lose both a win and mercy. I finally know the pain that all of these post about error codes are talking about. Why I could not have joined back with a grace period is something that I I will question now for a long time.

fqay7o,jeovex,Unlock the Tyrant's Surge Seasonal perk for constant Arc-Spawned Warmind Cells.,"Season of the Worthy has brought the cool addition of Warmind Cells to our arsenal but the RNG of it is quite lame and reduces their usability. Warmind perks help make their use more exciting and changes their frequency.

I strongly suggest that** all Arc subclass guardians, do yourselves a favor and unlock this season's Tyrant Surge** off of the Seasonal Artifact. It reads:
&gt; **Tyrant's Surge** :
Dealing damage with arc melee, Super and grenade abilities spawns a Warmind Cell.

Read that again. On *every* (not some) charged melee, grenade or super hit that causes damage to an enemy, you get a Warmind Cell. This completely removes the RNG factor of the Cells and they spawn consistently.

This is an amazing advantage to have when you solo activities or even better when running ""horde activities"" such as Seraph Tower Public event (obviously) but also when running less-populated older activities such as Escalation protocol, Forges, Altar of Sorrow, Menagerie, and of course, also useful in Raids.

Personally I run a Top-tree Striker Titan (yes I'm an APE...) with Insurmountable Skullfort so I get back my charged melee on minor enemy shoulder charges , have 2 grenades and perks to increase grenade energy on orb pickup, as well as a super which creates the cells too which also gives me a charges melee back if I kill an enemy with it...
 
THE

CELLS

ARE

ENDLESS.

Seriously though, give it a try, it will change the game for you and will make activities more successful even with randoms. (Looking at you Blueberries at Seraph Tower events.)


OH and also, please for the love of the Traveler, if you see a Warmind Cell, shoot the damn thing.

fq9wio,Space_Waffles,"Seasonal Mod slots should be universal for exotics, and Comet-DLC armor should be able to hold any mod from that year","Pretty much the title, but to explain further, it would be sick if exotics were different in more ways than just the exotic perk. Currently, they dont hold any seasonal mods, and it would make a lot of sense to me that these would be able to hold any season's mods. This would make them incredibly versatile and useful by allowing you to run something like Taken Barrier while all your other armor has Warmind Cell mods. Honestly though, anything is better than no seasonal slot.

It seems pretty weird as well that despite Dreambane and raid armor specifically having a different symbol than Undying armor, they serve the exact same purpose. I think it would make a lot of sense for the armor that comes out of yearly DLCs to hold any seasonal mod from that year. This means Dreambane armor would be able to hold mods from Season of Undying, Dawn, Worthy, and the next season. Currently, Dawn armor is the most versatile armor in the game, and that just seems weird",7,1585356479,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq9wio/seasonal_mod_slots_should_be_universal_for/,DestinyTheGame,1
fq9u2f,Mrlongtouch,Watercress and Newt Errors on Xbox one X,"Watercress is a error code i get once i try to get passed my character loading screen. Once i select my guardian i then get placed in this wierd black screen limbo mode in which i can hear and simingly push buttons but the screen and my ship nevee reach orbit. After a few minutes it finally shoots me a error code Watercress.

If for some reason i do make it to orbit and then finally able to do something i try to start any activity, it tries to load and then leaves me with the Newt error code. It sometimes returns me to orbit or sends me back into a black screen limbo mode again. 

All in all its unplayable and i cant find a fix for it on my own. People report about it but dont have a fix for it. 

Tried almost everything to make sure this isnt on my end. Uninstalled the game and reinstalled it,
 switched it from my SSD over to my internal,
 uninstalled several other games, 
Rebooted and updated my router (download and upload are at 400Mbps and 250Mbps),
never changed a setting on my router.
I can however log into my fiancee account and play with hers just fine on the same console and internet connection.

fq9qib,spacefuck5,Is trials broken.,"So I just wanna preface this by saying I’m no PVP god and I know there’ll be plenty of “git gud” comments so please spare me.

I’ve noticed more and more there seems to be some fundamental network issues with trials. The matchmaking can sometimes seem a little unfair and you get stomped but I appreciate it’s a pinnacle PVP activity so if you don’t wanna play good teams don’t play trials. The problem I’m referring to is just how laggy and inconsistent this game mode seems.

I’ve been playing a decent amount of comp last season and this as trials prep and rarely end a match with under 1.00 KD now. This week alone I’ve hit a lot of double positive games and even a few 4.0’s and up at around mythic so I would consider myself at least a semi-decent crucible player. I’ve played both in teams and solo and both seem to play just fine 99% of the time.

Now when I enter trials it’s like 1 in 10 games that I’m not being sniped through walls, being killed by players that have already died, or just randomly getting 1 shot by an auto rifle. My fire team and clan have all reported the same issues and was just wondering is this a widespread thing?

On the flip side I’m sure it sometimes works the other way where I’ve been exposed way too long and there’s no way somebody with 2 brain cells hadn’t headshot me yet I’m somehow unscathed, despite the hail of bullets coming my way. It just feels like this whole game mode is undercooked and full of bugs, but that’s my personal experience.

fq9l5u,sooPerNorMiE,You all need to calm down,"I understand that you all love this game, and that you’ve donated money towards eververse and towards dlc only for you to feel like the game isn’t progressing past a grind. However, those who are calling for DMG or Cosmo to be fired or being unnecessarily toxic towards anyone having fun or related to the game need to stop. Destiny is just a game, if you don’t like it, stop playing it and go do something you enjoy. 

If you want a destiny experience and are on console, go play destiny 1, it’s still got a beating heart and still as playable as ever. Hell, Doom Eternal is out and that’s a blast - go play that if you’re bored. 

If you aren’t enjoying a dlc you paid for, stop buying/pre-ordering them, that way you can decide later if you want to buy it.

With that whole FOMO catastrophe this community cooked up, it’s not bungie‘s fault you have other things in your life, if you want a specific weapon and can’t get it, that is unfortunate for you but it’s not bungie’s fault. 

Look this community can do amazing things like soloing raid bosses, solving the quest for outbreak prime and more, but now it’s just full of people needlessly bashing their heads against a keyboard and calling bungie lazy for decisions they don’t like. 

Of course constructive criticism is good, but at this point it’s not constructive, all the front page posts are about how terrible bungie is, how bored you are and more. Everyone needs to realise that this is just a game, and needs to go back to having fuck shooting aliens once more rather than complain about how you don’t have enough time to play due to your 15 trillion children stealing your time. 

Destiny is supposed to be a fun experience, enjoy it when you can, when you don’t, go do something else. Don’t bully bungie for a job they are trying to do.",4,1585355403,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq9l5u/you_all_need_to_calm_down/,DestinyTheGame,1

It's time for ghosts and sparrows to get the same love. New perks for both ( and the agro decrease mod needs to be on more sparrows too. ) 

Most of the ghost perks are honestly kinda rubbish.
 though, I would say make all shells ornaments, add some new perks, and the ability to have a certain tracker attached at all times. ( easy to do since you just redid the tracker systems. )

Maybe you could add some defensive or offensive perks, OR abilities like what the D1y3 relics had on them. Being able to choose from an ability tree on the ghosts would be awesome. ( improvement to all stats at the cost of super, different viewer modes, etc)

fq93lp,Janube,The State of Fusion Rifles in PvP,"So, this is something that needs to be talked about because most people have a single reference point for fusion rifles: Erentil FR4. Specifically, getting shot by it, or otherwise never seeing any fusion rifle (outside of Bastion). While many of us are aware of what makes a fusion rifle strong, I still want to cover them from the ground up, give recommendations for changes, and argue that they're *failing* at the core of their design philosophy (outside of Erentil and Elatha)

# The Core Philosophy

Fusion rifles are designed to be high risk, high reward weapons. By heavily committing to an engagement (required via charge time), you are ostensibly more likely to to win a fight under certain circumstances. Fusions cannot be used easily from the air and must be charged with a rather telling sound in order to be shot at all. As a core philosophy, the expectation here is *consistency*. Due to the nature of fights in this game, your ""reward"" is almost always killing a single opponent, so a ""high reward"" weapon needs to produce something that is outside the norm of a standard engagement. I submit that the design intent for fusion rifles was a consistent kill, such that if you committed, aimed well, and your opponent didn't evade properly (or kill you outright), the expectation is that you will kill them (given appropriate ranges).

# The Reality

Most fusions don't kill consistently. Especially after the changes. Ironically, while the changes were designed to knock Erentil from its spot as fusion-monarch, the only thing it did was ensure that no other fusion rifle could compete. The reason why boils down to some math, so you'll have to bear with me while I explain what makes a fusion rifle good:

# The Structure of a Fusion Rifle

Fusion rifles ultimately have two stats that matter right now, their Stability and their Zoom. These two stats in conjunction will determine how consistently you're hitting all of your bolts. Range is, as far as I can tell, almost entirely worthless for fusion rifles now, while zoom no longer pushes out damage drop-off any appreciable amount (the distinction between long and short zoom scopes is about 1-2m in the tribute hall).

With the only stats that matter being what they are, we run into the immediate problem noted by a popular video from before the nerf: Every good fusion needed a long zoom scope and Firmly Planted. Firmly Planted gives an amount of stability that I find it difficult to quantify, but my guess would be 20, and it appears to increase recoil direction substantially by providing an unspecified amount of accuracy, which is a bit of a nebulous stat that decreases spread. Regardless, you can feel the difference in consistency when shooting an opponent based on the presence of Firmly Planted and a Long Zoom scope (though scopes used also push out damage drop-off a substantial amount, they do not appear to anymore).

Lastly, the fusion rifle's frame matters. Namely, max impact are the best because they can kill in 4 bolts (below 7 resil), whereas a medium impact fusion (Precision frame) requires 5 bolts to kill within range and Adaptive/Rapid Fire frames require 6 bolts. This is out of a total 7 bolts in each fusion shot regardless of archetype. Their damage dropoff now scales to 1/2 max, so in order from top to bottom, the damage outputs are 48/24, 39/20, 38/19, and 35/18. The weaker two archetypes both require 6/7 bolts to kill at optimal range (0-20m) and cannot kill outside of that optimal range, while Erentil/Elatha require only 4 bolts to kill at a similar optimal range, and they can continue to kill up to roughly 26m. This on top of being able to kill some supers in one hit and all supers in two hits within effective range.

# Why is that a Problem?

Well, for one it's boring to pigeonhole an entire weapon archetype into a specific perk because it's *so damn good* (see: Mindbender's with Quickdraw). For another, it's because virtually no fusion rifles actually have scopes. The vast majority of fusion rifles are limited to short-range scopes or barrels by design. Only Erentil, Elatha, Timeline's Vertex (the new, non-farmable main ingredient model), Proelium, and in a weird twist, Tempered Dynamo, which has access to exactly one medium zoom scope. However, among those weapons, Tempered Dynamo cannot roll Firmly Planted (it does get Opening Shot, which is funny and unique, but not a good substitute). This means that our ""good"" fusion rifles are Erentil, Elatha, Proelium, and Timeline's Vertex in that they can all roll with Firmly Planted and a long zoom scope, which will increase the consistency of their bolts as much as possible.

Unfortunately, the consistency of landing 4 bolts is *much much* higher than the consistency of landing 6 bolts, which means that, by design, Erentil and Elatha will provide the most consistent one-shot potential for your buck, and this is largely the only thing that matters, since you will *rarely* have the time to charge and fire a second shot against a single opponent whether you're using a rapid fire or a max impact frame. Every single shot is a risk that half of your bolts will fly off to have a tea party instead of melting the brain of your opponent. Each additional risk on top is antithetical to the core demand of the weapon type, which is that you fire a single shot and kill the person you're looking at. As a result, all models fundamentally fail to deliver on the design philosophy that fusion rifles offer. They take away the consistency of your reward, which is the only thing that weapon type is supposed to offer.

Dying when peaking with a fusion rifle is pretty common as it is; for fusions to then *fail* to deliver the one thing they should be good at is silly, since they're already a niche weapon that requires you to alter your playstyle. Most weapons do not require the hard engagement that fusions do. If you fail to kill your opponent with one shot, you will probably die. If there's a second person, you will probably die. If there's a decent sniper, you will probably die. You have to make these risks when you start charging and pass a wall, while other weapon types can let you continually re-evaluate while firing.  That's the nature of loud, charging weapons that can't be used in the air or while sprinting. Their design *requires* that there be a commensurate reward for the risk that you're taking as a player. Erentil overdid it and rewarded you way too much, but literally every other model failed to adequately reward you, which is why no one *ever* used them. This patch hasn't fixed the core problem, since Erentil is still the best fusion rifle (and certainly the easiest good one to farm)

# Possible Suggestions

I would suggest giving unique and substantial buffs among non-high impact models and giving these weapon archetypes a reason to exist. If Precision frames were actually more precise and far more likely to hit all their bolts, they could compete with max impact frames despite the more demanding bolts-to-kill. If Rapid Fire frames automatically shot multiple bursts (like Bastion), they would serve a purpose. If Adaptive frames actually had superior base stats, or a toned-down version of backup plan, or they made your enemy explode (like a weaker Loaded Question), then maybe you would have a reason to use it even though it wasn't as consistent. Firmly Planted is phenomenal, but it shouldn't be a requirement. I would begrudgingly accept if it was a requirement on max impact frames, but it shouldn't be a requirement on any frame to make it passable.

# TL;DR

At their heart, fusions need to provide a high reward for their high risk playstyle, and while Erentil does that pretty well, ***VERY*** few other fusion rifles provide anything close to that. They either need to increase the secondary ""reward"" for winning a fight with a fusion rifle (providing an additional effect), increase the primary ""reward"" (increased consistency of kills by reducing spread/kick), or reduce the risk (mitigate the all-in factor of fusions, possibly through effects similar to Backup Plan or effects that give you damage reduction while charging). Again, I think Erentil's actually in a pretty good spot (despite Trials usage of 1% or less), but the other archetypes are in *desperate* need of buffs to give them a purpose.

I could do a similar post about fusions in PvE, but I think it would just be boiled down to ""they're not as good as other weapons, so why use them at all?"" outside of Loaded Question, which only seems to trigger its intended perk half the time since the last major patch.  


I encourage anyone with updated testing to correct me on anything here. I've tried to do my due diligence, but there's only so much I can do with limited time and resources. In particular, I'd be interested in exact spread distinctions between long and short zoom scopes post-patch and exact numbers on Firmly Planted if possible.  
Tap The Trigger and Rangefinder were on a short list of other perks to discuss, since they're, I think, two of the obvious best additions in PvP to Firmly Planted, but I think both are relatively minor by comparison.",34,1585353698,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq93lp/the_state_of_fusion_rifles_in_pvp/,DestinyTheGame,1

fq8lrd,spectre15,Please Bungie add locked loadouts and 1 revive per person in trials and ill explain why.,"#Locked loadouts

This is a feature that I feel really needs to make its way into trials to balance out matches. I’ve seen several scenarios where people will change their gear to the bare minimum light score and then change it to 1000 the second the get in the match so that they get easier players. Or a scenario where someone will go in with a bad loadout on purpose to trick the enemy team into playing a certain way and then swapping to the complete opposite play style. If you choose to go in with a loadout you should be stuck to that loadout. Trials is supposed to be an endgame activity that tests the best of the best. If you aren’t prepared and are constantly switching loadouts than you aren’t.

#One revive per person

This might be a touchy subject because most people like the luxury of their teammate sitting in the back of the map and reviving them 5 times but I think lives need to feel valuable in a competitive mode because when lives are valuable, teams play smart and it’s more rewarding to teams that do. I know somebody will comment down below and say, “Well you can just push them when a guy dies and it’s not a problem.” That’s not always the case. Let’s say your team picked a guy off and it’s a 2v2. You laser them but the circle around and give the guy a second chance. Then the fight goes on and the guy dies again. You used both of your revoker shots on him and now you are out. It’s a 1v1. You try to push but he gets revived for the third time and now has special ammo. He blasts you with a shotgun and boom you’re dead. If you kill somebody more than once then that kill should matter. He shouldn’t be getting a third or fourth chance.",22,1585352051,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq8lrd/please_bungie_add_locked_loadouts_and_1_revive/,DestinyTheGame,1

fq8jvf,CombatFIFChuck,Bungie: free bad idea for maintaining weapon/meta balance,"What if weapon stats auto balanced as they were used? So every crucible match, strike, etc.  that is completed with a specific meta weapon would slightly reduces that weapons stats in the game. Obviously you would want this to work pretty slow but basically you couldn't have a whole season where Hard Light dominates. The feel of the gun and special exotic mechanics would remain, but damage/range/accuracy would slowly drop off over time until it self balances. You could also have weapons gradually grow as they go unused by most players and eventually come into the meta. 

Of course, Bungie would need to make sure that each weapon type and subtype is where they want them in terms of range, damage fall off, and those other more hidden stats. And I am sure this would take a ton of work to set up, but it would eventually pay for itself because the work of rebalancing (or just nerfing the meta into uselessness) each season would be greatly reduced.",4,1585351872,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq8jvf/bungie_free_bad_idea_for_maintaining_weaponmeta/,DestinyTheGame,1

I know there’s shoulder charge but mobility wise it’s better for running away and the delay after is so damn slow it’s not very viable for mobility to close space or disorient enemy players. I think it would be great to give some sort of double jump or mid air strafe mechanic. Just something that makes it less linear. I don’t think every Titan should have a free icarus dash (although I would take that over a rally barricade shield) but just something similar in variability to triple jump.",4,1585349703,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq7v4k/titans_could_really_use_updated_jumps/,DestinyTheGame,2

fq7mde,PeterThyMeater,Hardlight needs to be addressed. Not in a few months. Now.,"Hardlight...at least on console....is out of control. It dominates the meta and needs to be fixed. Bungie took forever to nerf lord of wolves and lord of wolves was never this bad. Bungie has barely even acknowledged that Hardlight is that big of an issue. 

Even top tier 600 rpm autos struggle to compete against Hardlight let alone handcannons and other weapons. It is clear that it was overtuned. Whether that was intentional or not doesn't matter. What matters is that Bungie acknowledges and addresses the issue and not let this become another lord of wolves situation. I don't want another emblem after months of Hardlight abuse.

Regardless of where you think the game is at right now in terms of pve content, eververse, autorifle meta, etc.... Hardlight needs to be addressed. 

I don't like it but I can live with some 600 rpm autos beating handcannons in a one versus one. I can live with erentil and bastion...etc. But god, Hardlight is really close to making me put down the game for a while. It also honestly feels like this was intentional overtune to give worse players and new light/new players a better chance to compete in PVP so that they can get hooked on destiny and become whales (buying stuff from eververse etc.) It feels like Bungie is making decision oriented around the Mobile game system kinda like a recent post talked about. That may not be true but its hard to tell because Bungie has barely acknowledge Hardlight. 

So I am left pleading and posting into the reddit if for nothing else just solidarity.

Now should bounties be the main grind? No, but my point remains that this game feels nothing like a mobile game, go play a mobile game, clash of clans can take up to a week to upgrade some things, at least in destiny the upgrades to the bunkers depend on how much you play, what if the upgrade took 3 hours to complete after you turned in the resources to buy it? I don’t think anyone would play destiny if that was the case.

Destiny doesn’t feel like a mobile gacha game, destiny just has a problem with the content not being replayable enough right now, doing bounties for bits isn’t necessarily fun, and the public event doesn’t change much, but can you honestly compare destiny to a mobile game? No, no you can’t, most mobile games aren’t First person looter shooter mmos like destiny is. Be glad that destiny isn’t of the quality of a mobile game because it could be be a whole lot worse than what it is.

fq76q5,motrhed289,Solo Players should not be excluded from earning Upgrade Materials,"Other posts have made it clear that we need alternate sources of Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards, having them locked behind Ordeal Nightfalls is not idea.  What I'd like to address is that I don't think it's OK for these materials to be out of reach for solo players.

Don't get me wrong, specific rewards like armor, weapons, and even mods are OK to put behind specific activities like raids and Trials, that's fine, but core upgrade materials/currency should not be reserved for activities that can only be completed by a premade team.

Now comes the part where I tell Bungie how it makes me FEEL.  I'm standing in front of Saladin, turning in my IB tokens, and I get a nice armor roll to drop.  It's better than my currently masterworked armor I got from him last season, and it has the new season slot.  This should make me happy, but it doesn't, I feel SAD and TORN.  I have THREE Ascendant Shards in my inventory, and it took me a LONG TIME and a lot of Enhancement Cores to get them (I fill up on bounties from Banshee and buy two from Spider every single time I play).  Now, I DON'T WANT TO EVEN EARN NEW BETTER ARMOR, because I know I'll have to spend this ULTRA RARE currency to upgrade my new armor.  I still have over 200 IB tokens, but I stop turning them in to Saladin, and I log out.  That's how the current upgrade material economy makes me feel.  I believe that if the upgrades weren't so damn expensive/rare, that I would be happy to get better gear, and spend a bit of hard-earned (but not extremely rare) materials to upgrade new armor pieces every couple seasons.

So I guess there are two problems here.  First that as a solo player I have no real avenue to earn Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards (sure, I can play the lower level Ordeals and hope to earn one or two prisms in a week, but that has not proven fruitful).  And second, the cost to get those last 2-3 upgrades on any armor piece (especially exotics) is incredibly high, to the point where I can realistically only do 2-3 armor pieces per season.  If that was your intent Bungie, then well done, you hit your target, but I can tell you it doesn't feel good when it comes time to retire your masterworked armor after 1-2 seasons.

I know Bungie is less receptive of actual solution suggestions, but here's what I have regardless.

Short-term (next season at the latest, these are simple changes): Open up all levels of the Ordeal Nightfall to matchmaking.  Don't worry, we can handle it.  If we have a hard time or bad experience, some of us will give up, others will form a team, but at least we're given the opportunity to try.  I'll bet there are a lot of us solo players that can carry a couple blueberries through a Master nightfall, we just need someone to soak up some bullets and get our revive every now and then.  In addition to this, significantly reduce the cost of Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards from Banshee, like cut them both in half: 5 cores per prism and 5 prisms per shard, effectively 25 cores per shard (down from 100), which effectively reduces the cost of those last couple armor levels.

Long-term: Figure out how to offer more pinnacle-level activities to put these rewards into, that are accessible to us solo players.  And no, saying we can solo a Legend+ Ordeal Nightfall is not acceptable, it should be on a similar level of difficulty as the team-curated pinnacle activities.

I'm tired of this Pinnacle = Team mentality in general, I actually find it a bit insulting as a solo player, it's treating us like second-class Guardian.  Yes, there needs to be some activities that actually require a pre-made team (raids for PvE, Trials for PvP), I'm fine with that, but those can't be the sole source of pinnacle gear and materials.  Solo players willing to take on tough challenges are just as worthy to upgrade their gear as team players.",21,1585347507,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq76q5/solo_players_should_not_be_excluded_from_earning/,DestinyTheGame,1
fq75iz,FHBiv,"Bungie, my grapes are missing.","The part I'm referring to is the seeker grapes that come out of the Slowva Bomb. In my experiences in crucible, I see way too many of my Nova's hit a surface and produce 0 grapes, and I didn't know why.

So I tested this in a private match for a small bit, and I found that, sometimes you are just unlucky and hit a surface at a bad angle, resulting in grapes instantly exploding. But I found a pattern, a consistent way to get 0 grapes upon impact.

[6-8 meters from throw to explosion](https://xboxclips.co/fhbiv/90a196cf-4122-4115-8caf-dd5e2e619b32), will cause the seekers not to spawn, often resulting in a disappointing Nova. I am unsure if this pattern is distance based or time based, or has more factors, but it is pretty damaging to the Nova's effectiveness, since far range kills tend to be difficult with it's slow speed.

So why is this a thing? Possibly to prevent being instantly killed by 4 Seekers + Explosion damage (Even though the main explosion doesn't do any damage till 4 meters), this could be a possibility. But I think that if that's what is causing this pattern to exist, than remove the seekers self-damaging property, it barely does any damage if it manages to hit you in the first place.

But seeing your Nova hit in the middle of 3 grouped up people, and throw out no trackers is upsetting, and too commonly seen. I would rather risk being insta-killed by my dumb grapes than throw out none consistently.",1,1585347392,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq75iz/bungie_my_grapes_are_missing/,DestinyTheGame,1
fq74cc,CyberClawX,The problem with Destiny weapons IMO,"This is only my option, that goes without saying, but I think there is a serious problem with Destiny weapons, and they are going the wrong way about it. The problems are weapon creation &amp; design, weapon perks, and finally, multiplayer.

There are 2 schools of weapon loot when it comes to this kind of game. There is the Diablo/Borderlands approach, of extreme randomisation, and there is the JRPG/Monster Hunter way of set weapons with flexible customization. Destiny 1, and by extent D2Y2 sits awkwardly in the middle. Not enough randomization, and semi-rigid set weapons.

Different weapons already all look alike anyway, the tools Bungie had pre-D1 for armor/weapon creation, where they could just pick and mix whatever they wanted, could be adapted for automatic creation. And then just open the floodgates for the randomized weapons. Random barrel, random stock, random perks, random Supreme Name of the Firebolt. Right now, artists spend time developing 50 shotguns, when in practice everyone will use and chase maybe 3 or 4 tops. This doesn't mean throwing unique weapons away. Stuff like raids or trials, could still have unique weapons with a preselected set of shiny perks.

But this brings the next problem. The perk pool is so small, you end up only having 1 or 2 interesting perks. Heck, Bungie is thinking about retiring old weapons, but we all have that gut feeling we'll just be chasing new versions of the same old perks. Like whatever the new shotgun with One two punch is.

Anything out of the ordinary gets relegated to exotic, and by extent, largely ignored, because, again, everyone just uses 4 or 5 exotics. Perks should be crazier, right now we only care for faster reloads, and bigger damage perks, because that's almost all there is to it. Look at Diablo or Borderlands. Weapons with auto healing or with residual damage could be more than just exotic perks. Throw us a wall of perks, and let us sort out what is good or not.

But this brings the third problem. A deep perks pool would easily throw off PvP (heck, the shallow pool right now already throws off PvP). The problem here is Bungie wants some parity between PvE and PvP. They have seen many times, this parity just brings problems to the game, but everytime they just take babysteps because they think this is one of the game core principles. It shouldn't be.

During D1, weapon tuning was the same for PvE and PvP, meaning weapons like shotguns were worthless in PvE to avoid them being OP in PvP. PvE weapons like Mythoclast were nerfed because they were too good in PvP. They changed that, now weapons are balanced different between PvP and PvE. They made regular PvP ignore light levels, and heck, now with Trials, they removed the artifact when they saw how ill received it'd be. There is disparity already, it's time for bigger steps. 

It'd be fine to have PvE only perks on weapons (and by extent PvP only perks for Trial, IB and Crucible weapons). Mark them as working only on darkness enemies or on guardians. The player base doesn't care, we want more variety, we want the chase.

Right now Bungie can't create enough loot, they never could, but in this past few seasons it's been felt more and more. And the answer seems so simple. Let machines handle it. Go the Borderlands way. You just need to feed new perks, and new weapon pieces, and on our end we get exponentially more loot. Leave the handmade artist weapons for a few unique weapons. Heck you could even have seasonal weapon pieces, like the mossy weapons we had during the Vex Moon invasion, if you still want a ""you had to be there"" feeling.

TLDR: 1. Make weapons random, 2. give us crazy game breaking perks, 3. make those perks only work on PvE (or PvP).",7,1585347285,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq74cc/the_problem_with_destiny_weapons_imo/,DestinyTheGame,1

This exotic is key to running a Weapons of Light build and yet there has been no word whatsoever on it getting patched.,"/u/dmg04 /u/cozmo23 When can we expect some information on when this will get worked on? I can get super energy from my melees UNTIL I BUILD MY SUPER. After using that super, I have to un-equip this exotic and re-equip Doomfang Pauldrons just to be able to use the exotic in the way its intended. I am on Xbox, and this process takes FOREVER due to inventory/character screen loading times. SO, i simply do not use this exotic and i simply do not use Bubble. It sucks. Because its the best damage buff in the game and that is only one problem in regards to Sentinel. Melee tracking is still broken for Sentinel. Orbs do not get produced from the bubble half the time. When can we expect Doomfang and Sentinel to finally get looked at.

PS: I get that many of you aren't experiencing this issue, or simply do not realize you are no longer getting the adequate amount of super energy per melee with this exotic.

I figured since I was 1004 light I could solo it, I was using Bastion, Travellers Judgement with anti-barrier rounds, and a maxed out sword. I could not beat the two bosses at the end, they stand next to each other and re-heal constantly. If this is Bungie's idea of content than this is a sad season indeed. There is nothing fun about this, its pure misery, we have bosses that teleport constantly and now re-heal constantly. If anybody has any pointers they could give me would be great, I am a SOLO player, not going on a third party app to play a game, just doesn't interest me. I do enjoy challenging activities but this season is just a contentless super grind that feels like a job rather than a game. If next season does not drastically improve than I have to say I am out. I just don't have fun playing this game anymore. Don't get me wrong I love this game and this shared universe but Bungie are just phoning it in. No pinnacle or Ritual weapons to chase and their excuse is we made Trials weapons and it's too hard. Trials disappeared for years to be re-tooled and then they just copy/pasted from D1. Bungie can't be bothered to make content for this game yet Eververse is filled with new content. If this is the new norm than I will move on to a game where the developers give a shit and have some passion and innovation instead of making excuses and doing the bare minimum. Even Trials is destined to fail because they didn't bring back adept weapons and there is no reason to go flawless. I'm not just angry I am bummed out because I actually love and care about this game. You can't make 300 million in digital revenue in 2019 and not put some of that money back into the game. Hire more developers, bring in some other studios, they clearly have the money to do so.

So, that i can get a legendary or other exotic up to LL for this moment in time.

fq4l4q,Dark_Assassin7O,On how to get Catalyst Question?,"(Some long text..)

Hey there Everyone and every guardians!. I have some questions that I would greatly appreciate if anyone has time to answer or knows the answer. The questions should involve the Catalysts for certain weapons which are:

Skyburner's Oath (Exotic Cabal Scout Rifle)

Legend of Acrius (Exotic Cabal Heavy Shotgun)

Telesto Catalyst (Eater of Worlds Prestige)

Sleeper Simulant (Spire of Stars Prestige)

So, Unfortunately for me. I am missing these 4 Catalysts. As far I am aware you can do these things to get them even though they are luck based drops:

Skyburner's Oath and Legend of Acrius. Complete the first part of The Original Raid on Prestige (Where you got to survive and place flags down to open the door to the next encounter). Once it's completed. Get the chest for a luck drop. I heard you can only try to get lucky three times (Three characters) while someone told me you can farm it unlimited times to hopefully get lucky. Is this true Everyone?

Telesto Catalyst. I tried out the Solo Glitch thing to get to the secret chest.. And oh boy.. It's was Incredible tough. I find it to the point where it's not worth it. So... What are your advices to attempt and get this Catalyst? I heard you can take the advantage of the first encounter three times and hope that you get lucky. It is true?

Sleeper Simulant Catalyst. I seen there is a first encounter glitch to grab the objective and use your super to reset the greed. But that may not matter if I can find a team. Umm. Same with Eater of Worlds. I heard you can take advantage of the First Encounter three times and hope you get lucky.

Now to the main questions.

#1. For Eater of Worlds/Spire of Stars. Can you farm the Chest unlimited times for a chance to get the Catalyst for either Telesto or Sleeper Simulant?

#2. If you can't farm the chest unlimited times. Are you guarantee to receive the Catalyst upon beating the final boss?

#3. Any other advices that I am not aware of?

Also lastly. I am on Xbox myself in case anyone is wondering.

Well that is all everyone. Thank you and I hope to receive replies that may help me and my team if possible.",2,1585339719,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq4l4q/on_how_to_get_catalyst_question/,DestinyTheGame,2

fq4eoh,FHBiv,"Top Tree Nova Bomb grapes are very dysfunctional, how about we fix that?","The part I'm referring to is the seeker grapes that come out of the Slowva Bomb. In my experiences in crucible, I see way too many of my Nova's hit a surface and produce 0 grapes, and I didn't know why.

So I tested this in a private match for a small bit, and I found that, sometimes you are just unlucky and hit a surface at a bad angle, resulting in grapes instantly exploding. But I found a pattern, a consistent way to get 0 grapes upon impact.

[6-8 meters from throw to explosion](https://xboxclips.co/fhbiv/90a196cf-4122-4115-8caf-dd5e2e619b32), will cause the seekers not to spawn, often resulting in a disappointing Nova. I am unsure if this pattern is distance based or time based, or has more factors, but it is pretty damaging to the Nova's effectiveness, since far range kills tend to be difficult with it's slow speed.

So why is this a thing? Possibly to prevent being instantly killed by 4 Seekers + Explosion damage (Even though the main explosion doesn't do any damage till 4 meters), this could be a possibility. But I think that if that's what is causing this pattern to exist, than remove the seekers self-damaging property, it barely does any damage if it manages to hit you in the first place.

But seeing your Nova hit in the middle of 3 grouped up people, and throw out no trackers is upsetting, and too commonly seen. I would rather risk being insta-killed by my dumb grapes than throw out none consistently.",0,1585339205,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq4eoh/top_tree_nova_bomb_grapes_are_very_dysfunctional/,DestinyTheGame,1

fq3ibp,-TwoSixNine-,The current state of 600RPM auto rifles in the console Crucible,"So I've just gotten back from a few months' break from Destiny and I gotta say this new meta doesn't make any sense. 600RPM autos are too strong on console and either they need to be nerfed, or other primaries need to be buffed. This post is a bit long but I'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute or two to read it and leave some feedback.  

The main problem with Hard Light and 600RPM autos, in general, is that they now have faster base TTKs than any archetype of hand cannon while also being the easiest weapons to use. A 0.7 second base TTK on a 600RPM auto and 0.8 second base TTK on a 150RPM hand cannon... what? On console, where it's already hard enough to hit 3 headshots in a row because of bloom, flinch, and a less accurate input method, there is essentially zero reason to use anything but an AR right now unless (like me) you have a strong preference for the hand cannon playstyle. If you're not forcing yourself to peekshoot with Spare Rations in every single engagement, you'd be better off with a Hard Light, and even if you *do* try to abuse peekshooting, chances are you'll get prefired down because these things apparently have 50 round magazines.  

What's even the point of hand cannons anymore? They're supposed to reward precision with the fastest TTKs the game has to offer. Like I said, on console, I don't usually hit a 3-crit anyways and I'm a top 0.5% player... now I can put two headshots into someone and get killed before I can even get a third shot off because the most forgiving weapons in the game outright beat my Thorn. Before the update, my rumble win ratio was close to 90%. Now I'm only winning about 65% of my games. I get stomped by bots because any 600RPM AR can easily outgun any hand cannon at literally any range with the slightest amount of gun skill. ARs are destroying what little skill gap we have left and I see people here embracing it because ""Spare Rations takes no skill,"" or ""hand cannons have been meta for so long, it's time for another primary meta."" Like come on man, SR has only marginally higher aim assist than other weapons in this game and if you miss even one headshot your TTK goes up to 1.2 seconds (God forbid you miss entirely). I don't use Spare Rations but if you think it takes no skill you're flat out wrong.  

Hand cannons were *rightfully* the best. People get stomped by good players using hand cannons and aren't good enough to counter them or pick one up themselves, but they refuse to admit it. Instead, they complain that it takes no skill to make themselves feel better about losing. Thanks to this attitude, we have recoilless, 50 round magazine, no-skill-required, low-risk, high-reward bullet hoses dominating the console crucible. Now that 600RPMs are broken, all of those guys can *finally* counter HC players like me regularly and have subsequently been running me down in rumble, because *now* it takes no effort! Simply equip Hard Light/The Summoner/Suros Regime and profit. My Thorn has wet dreams about being able to kill someone as fast as these things can.  

Unfortunately, most people only like the meta when it's good for *them,* not the game as a whole. People who love this new meta probably weren't doing too well in the last one, and 600RPM ARs like Hard Light have given them an excuse to say ""See? It wasn't my fault I was losing! It was the game's!"" And before you say ""Hey, aren't you complaining right now because this meta isn't good for you? Isn't that hypocritical?""  

**No**. This meta makes no sense for the (console) crucible as a whole. The premise of my argument is that a weapon's dominance should be decided by its difficulty to use. The harder a weapon is to use, the faster its TTK should be for those who can use it well. If hand cannons aren't at the top, then Bungie needs to make them easier to use or make the offending class more difficult to use in compensation. It's not a matter of opinion. It's basic balancing and game design. So long as hand cannons are the hardest to use, you would be *wrong* to say they shouldn't be the best.  

Fact of the matter is, though, that unless they get a major adjustment, hand cannons will *always* be the most skillful weapons to use on console and thus should *always* be the most rewarding. Higher skill players will *always* prefer hand cannons and lower skill players will *always* complain that they're overpowered. In any case, ARs take less skill on console no matter how you look at it, so I guess enjoy the meta while it's fresh, 'cause getting Hard Light rounds rammed down your throat at 600RPM by people less skilled than you is gonna get real old, real fast.",27,1585336524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq3ibp/the_current_state_of_600rpm_auto_rifles_in_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

fq3g85,BravePumpkins,Changes to the masterwork system,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the masterwork system and how it uses in-game materials to level things up.

I feel like there is a strong disconnect here between fulfilling progression and essentially item farming.

Leveling a weapon only feels good when you get it masterworked. Same with armors. Levels 1-9 don’t give you a sense of progression.

Every minute spent in the game should feel like you’re moving towards a goal.

Masterworking weapons and armor should be similar to how we masterwork exotics with catalysts.

You could still use enchantment cores to add a nice chunk of XP, however, just getting kills with the weapon would move the bar up. Precision kills would reward even more. 

This way, just by playing the game, you know you’re moving closer to the goal: getting a masterwork. 

As for armor, they could determine ranking up XP for each piece by doing specific actions. For example, class item XP would go up each time you used your class ability. Arm pieces would gain XP on melee kills etc.

I personally find the enchantment core grind to be a huge slog. It doesn’t feel rewarding. But converting the enchantment cores to be essentially boosters (like faction tokens) to a weapon/armors progression would feel fun, and less strict as to how you want to play.

fq33ty,wrightosaur,What did Luke Smith mean by this in the 2020 Director's Cut?,"&gt; Our combat team works extremely hard to make weapons **feel unique**. Each Legendary (and many blues) get their own flavors of special sauce. Sometimes it’s the way a gun sounds, sometimes it’s the insanely over budget range stat (HAND IN HAND), sometimes it’s the recoil pattern, sometimes it’s the art, sometimes it’s something indescribable that just makes an item resonate with our players. 

I don't particularly understand the part where he says they try to make Legendary/blue weapons feel unique. For instance, when there are like 200 hand cannons that all have the exact same reload animation, the exact same fire sound, where the only discernible difference asides from stats (or perhaps frame) is that visually they have different camos. Otherwise, it's near impossible for me to see that there is any ""uniqueness"" in most of the weapons for D2.  For instance, the Erentil. This season we saw a return of the old Faction Rally gear, and one weapon which looks exactly the same is the Timeless Vertex, which looks exactly like a Proelium, which looks exactly like an Elatha.  The SMG Hard Truths looks exactly like New City which also looks near identical to the re-released Escape Velocity. The Recluse? How strange of it to fire and feel exactly the same as the Red Mamba, the Death Adder, and the blue weapons Furina and the Whip Scorpion.

So if anything, can someone explain how they try to make their weapons feel unique when it feels like way too many weapons are hashed out reskins of pre-existing weapons just with a different frame archetype?",4,1585335374,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq33ty/what_did_luke_smith_mean_by_this_in_the_2020/,DestinyTheGame,0

fq31vn,Crusader3456,"The Ability to Hoard Tokens will Ruin Future Crucible, Iron Banner, and Vanguard Vendor Refreshes","**The Observation**

With the Token System being introduced into Trials, I wondered why Bungie had decided to implement a one week expiration date on the Tokens.  Many thought it was to target the loot for the week but weeing that the unlocks permanently stay in the Trials Engram, many people were confused as to why they disappear.  So I go to thinking why might that be?  Token Hoarding.  They don't want future weapons to be grinded out to oblivion the moment they come out and players get them added to the pool.  This can most easily be seen in the Iron Banner.  Why not disappear at the end of each season?  Well, imagine uniformed players loosing thousands of tokens because the system was unclear.  That wouldn't go over well at all.  Do it weekly and at most players might lose out on a few hundred at most.  

**The Problem**

But how does this relate to the sources in my title?  Look at how many tokens we have stored up.  I'm sure many of you have tens of thousands like I do, or at least a few thousand.  Why would any time be spent to simply refresh the loot if we aren't going to even play to get it?  I think the reason fall not only with the lack of ability to monetize, and what Datto says in [His Video on Sunsetting] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dhYZpulTlg) where he talks about us not wanting to change what we use, but also the game economy itself.  Something about the acquisition of newer vendor gear needs to change.  And I am not alone in thinking this.  Obviously Bungie has seen it with the way Tokens work in Trials (which has its own set of problems).  And I think the community is starting to harp up on it again after not complaining about the Token system much such as this very recent Reddit Thread [here] (https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpld26/gambit_is_currently_the_best_game_mode_in_the/).  But I don't want this thread to just I want to offer possible solutions to the problem.  

I expect to see some: ""But OP I EARNED those Tokens, why shouldn't I be able to hoard them?"" It doesn't make good balance.  Plain and simple.  It makes acquiring any new gear trivial and leads to apathy towards playing.  It never should've made it out of D2Y1 as it is. I do not think that they should be taken without warning, but the system needs to change for the health of the game, and in my opinion it is a bigger problem than most others in the long term except maybe the Seasonal Model (but that has been discussed to death here and is not the point of this post).

**Potential Solutions**

Bungie could take the Trials approach an blow away all of our tokens and rework the system from scratch.  This would be annoying especially to those who don't follow Bungie news, as they could potentially lose out on thousands of materials.  If you think blowing away our Emblem Trackers caused a stir, this solution has the potential to be far worse but would allow for the most well refined new solution as it would be a blank slate for them to completely redesign the system.


If the token system is to stay, then it needs to be separated from the currently in focus refresh.  What do I mean by that.  Well, let us look at [Luke Smith's most recent (and controversial) Director's Cut] (https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48758).  We know sun-setting is coming whether we like it or not (and this is not the thread to discus it). Obviously the Ritual Activities will have loot that is obtainable to be used in Endgame (it would be a major fail if the core modes didn't offer a way to take on the Endgame ones).  I would suggest not allowing those items to be obtainable through tokens.  But, endgame is not the game.  It is only a small portion.  Old guns will still be usable in all other areas of play.  Some are really powerful like Swarm of the Raven, Claws of the Wolf, Outrageous Fortune, and so on.  Collectors too will want to collect all the old guns which aren't being removed from the game.  Make them the target of tokens.  Any gun or armor piece that is not in the current refresh, the current object of grinding, should be placed into a pool that Tokens can be used for.  This limits the relevance of hoarding tokens a bit, deals with the ever growing size of the Vendor Pool keeping the currently in Endgame weapons readily available, while still allowing for old guns to be obtained by collectors and players uninterested in the Endgame.

**In Conclusion**

This is a combination of a feedback piece and a discussion piece.  I want to know what everyone else in the community thinks.  I ask that the conversation be kept as germane to the topic of Tokens as possible.  If any ideas are posted below that are liked enough i will put them up here.  i hope that seeing the weekly scrubbing of tokens in Trials means that Bungie is already looking at this for the Fall.",1,1585335218,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq31vn/the_ability_to_hoard_tokens_will_ruin_future/,DestinyTheGame,0

fq30fl,Vortro,BUFF/FIX WARDEN'S LAW (the lone weapon in the Double Fire archetype),"**Some background**: Warden's Law is a 110 RPM hand cannon that falls into the Double-Fire archetype. It basically splits the bullet in half, and does 1 extra damage compared to other 110 RPM's. The weapon is a nightfall exclusive weapon, coming from the ""Warden of Nothing"" nightfall. Link to weapon:  [https://www.light.gg/db/items/233423981/wardens-law/](https://www.light.gg/db/items/233423981/wardens-law/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**HOWEVER**: The weapon is extremely bugged. Initially, the curated roll came with Fourth Times The Charm, and people assumed that after 2 shots were fired, the perk would proc. This would have been very interesting. Of course, it ended up being broken and Bungie simply replaced Fourth Times The Charm with Zen Moment. *Lame*. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to that being broken, the weapon also doesn't work with artifact mods. I'm fairly certain that unstoppable shot doesn't even work, but I may be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Warden's Law is a very unique weapon that had a lot of potential. While it is a forgotten weapon, I'm sure myself and many others would be excited to see it be reworked and possibly even buffed, since it's a one of a kind weapon.",271,1585335102,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq30fl/bufffix_wardens_law_the_lone_weapon_in_the_double/,DestinyTheGame,2

fq2s02,dark1859,I think we should talk about PvP buffs and nerfs having an effect on PvE,"So look, petty much everyone knows it they've done it for years now but, it should go without saying that PvE buffs should Always be separate from PvP and vise versa. And yet almost always without fail, whenever bungie buffs for nerfs one, they buff or nerf both, even if one is in a perfect place (ie early d2 scout rifles needing a massive nerf in PvP but being perfectly fine as they were in PvE, leading to a massive nerf that even to this day they've not fully recovered from). 

The most recent prominent example of this inability to get it through their heads that PvE operates differently from PvP is sniper rifles, while a couple of the exotics may have required some nerfing for balance sake (mostly izzy's burden) what did bungie do? they went the nuclear option nerfing them both in pve and pvp in some misguided attempt to make them less effective in the at the time upcoming trials despite the fact they were perfect in PvE. 

Its been shown in the past bungie is fully capable of creating separate buffs nerfs and updates for one without changing the other so it baffles me that bungie keeps treating them as the same universal gamemode when quite frankly this is both erroneous and just plain stupid. But, whether it's incompetence, malice, or plain old time crunch is up for you to decide, all i know is that i'm getting a little bit sick of bungie's ham fisted attempts to fix nonexistent problems or going nuclear on problems that really only needed very minor tweaks.",3,1585334434,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq2s02/i_think_we_should_talk_about_pvp_buffs_and_nerfs/,DestinyTheGame,1

fq2ojn,Shadow9951,My 2 cents on the State of the Game,"
Every since my best friend showed me Destiny 1 it became on of my 3 favorite games along side Pokémon and Legend of Zelda. I am mainly a solo PvX player. I have done both Dungeons Solo Flawless on all 3 characters and love the challenge but the amount I can do solo to farm gear is very limited.

I was excited when Bungie started last year with the incorporating more RPG elements into the game and while they hit the mark on a couple things there are others that missed it. I’m very scattered so expect this to be somewhat of a mess. 

Raids/Dungeons

I’m grouping these together as dungeons are pretty much mini raids in my mind. The encounters themselves are great. However the raid loot doesn’t stand out. Curated rolls were great as a way of introducing some great static rolls along side random rolls but they seemed to have disappeared in the latest raid. I remember the days in D1 where I farmed for Fatebringer/Black Hammer because they were different from the rest. I’ll be covering my complete thoughts on loot later. Dungeons also fall into this category of why should you play them. Nothing loot wise comes from the dungeon aside from a fully masterworked piece off armor with average to bad stats.

Seasonal Mods

Starting with this season I feel like builds using season mods and exotic combos to change up play style. This season for example I just made a build using Warmind Cells/Thundercrash/Mountaintop/Swords. It plays with great add clear and with the buff with swords can do great damage as well. Simply ballistic slam into a group of enemies, jump back and shoot the cell with mountaintop to blow up everything around. I’m hoping as we move forward their becomes more diversity created by this. 

Loot

Now my biggest complaint is with loot in Destiny 2. With seasonal mods creating build diversity highlighted when I was trying to make my build above. I wanted to create a build using swords and warmind cells but the problem came with trying to find armor. There is simply too much RNG in the current system and while we have a good influx of loot that also causes a problem. I went through my vault and dismantled 200+ pieces of armor. And that was from just 2 weeks of playing. It is hard for a piece of armor to be better since it depends on the other pieces. If swap my chest then I need to make sure I continue to hit the breakpoints I want. And stat total doesn’t always mean better. I could have a 65 stat armor piece with 2 recovery and I would consider it trash compared to my 50 stat armor piece with 20 recovery.

The Grind

The grind to masterwork armor is a long and expensive and for someone who plays PvP and PvE mostly solo the grind is a bit impossible. Ascendent Shards are the biggest problem as they only have a chance to drop from Master Nightfalls or Trials. The benefits are great and at times required to do certain mod combos but can be too much effort and in my eyes not worth it until you have a set to commit to. But then the rest of the armor drops become worthless unless you want to remasterwork it. 

TLDR/My feedback

My thoughts are scattered and confusing but will at least recap here. 

Bring back curated unique drops in raids. 

Stats in armor need to be less RNG dependent. Maybe make some armor sets give default +10 to stats like how armor 1.0 worked. Or let us adjust stats using glimmer and planetary mats. This would make base stat total be more important as you can have more room to adjust your stats. And with seasonal mods armor won’t always be a one and done with this.

Make Ascendent Shards more available to players. Weekly gunsmith bounties would be more than enough or even doing his powerful for guaranteed 1 a week per character. 

I love Destiny and would love to see it grow and become better but the amount of RNG makes it feel like a mobile game to get the stuff you want and as a solo player there doesn’t feel like there is much I can do to improve my gear.

We’ve heard player feedback loud and clear about bounties being the primary source of XP. We’re working on long-term solutions to this issue and will have more to share in the coming months. In the meantime, we’re implementing a short-term solution to provide extra XP that will roll out next month. It should help streamline the bounty process:

Bounty experience has been doubled, and all vendor bounties will be replaced. Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter’s current daily bounties have been retired. Each will be given a new set of daily bounties to encourage a wider, more varied gameplay experience.  

- **New Zavala Dailies**
- Fuck That Guy – Complete 2 Drifter Bounties  
- Crucible? More like Poo-cible – Complete 2 Crucible Bounties  
- **New Shaxx Dailies:**
- Seriously, Fuck That Guy – Complete 2 Drifter Bounties
- When Do I Get My Own Strike – Complete 2 Vanguard Bounties
- **New Drifter Daily:**
- They’re Just Jealous – Complete 2 Vanguard and 2 Crucible Bounties

In addition, other bounty vendors are getting a tune-up:

- Planetary vendors are getting overhauled. Their bounties will remain the same; however, instead of awarding 5 planetary materials for each completed bounty, the bounties will instead drop 5 additional bounties.

- The one exception to this is Spider. His WANTED bounties are being tweaked; instead of hunting down WANTED enemies, players will instead be tasked with finding and completing elusive WANTED bounties.

- All of Ada-1’s weapon frame bounties are being removed. Instead, players will able to forge additional bounties. 

We hope these additional sources of XP will tide you over until a more permanent solution is found.

-=-=-=-=-

**Player Support Report**

Known issues with the upcoming patch:

- An issue was discovered late during the patch development cycle that we are unable to remove before the rollout. Because the new Vanguard, Crucible, and Drifter dailies all require each other’s bounties to be completed, there is no way to actually complete any of the bounties. Until a solution can be found, all bounties will be disabled.

fq1n0q,renaldafeen,Giving Players back a modicum of control: make Prime Engram decryption slot-selectable.,"There is so much reliance on RNG in this game that at times it's almost ridiculous, and frequently demoralizing. 

**TL;DR**: let ME tell Rahool which slot I want my Prime Engram decrypted to.

Seasonal content in D2 now appears to have degenerated to a minimum viable product, where ""engagement"" with new content (such as it is) is largely achieved by level-gating, requiring a grind for increased power level. Fine. If that's how it's going to be, then maybe BUNGiE can at least consider one small way to ease the negative effects of relying on RNG for everything, at least during the leveling process. That would be: to update Prime Engrams so that decryption can target a specific slot.  This change would eliminate only ONE of the MULTITUDE of different RNG elements associated with Primes, and IMHO it would eliminate the most aggravating one. 

Whenever leveling, almost without fail when I go to decrypt a prime engram it will land in a slot where it does me absolutely no good whatsoever, typically that's the slot where I already have my highest-power or second-highest-power item. Being able to select the decryption slot would give a tiny bit of control back to the player while leveling, i.e., at least relative to the control players had in early D1, where we could select the slot of EVERY SINGLE decryption, based on the chance that it could be (slightly) higher light.

Already throttled by the Prime Attunement buff, and made inherently random once the buff is active, Prime Engrams drop infrequently enough that the benefit to player morale from a change like this would far outweigh any possible detriments in terms of making things ""easy"". All of the remaining RNG aspects associated with Primes would remain when the drop occurs: if it's armor, those random aspects are its elemental affinity, what energy level it drops at, along with what MOB/RES/REC/DIS/INT/STR values it has, what armor style it's from, and whether or not it has a seasonal mod slot; if a weapon, what class and specifically which item in that class, the individual values of its \~10 attributes, its Masterwork buff, its weapons perks... I mean, isn't all of that ENOUGH frelling RNG?? It's hard to imagine how giving players BACK some control over their rewards would upset any ""balance"" that's supposedly maintained by making all of this so completely random.

RNG really has only one purpose: to force players to grind for hours, doing the same thing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over, hoping for the result they're looking for. It's the laziest path to ""player engagement"" imaginable and IMHO it really needs to ease up a little in this game. BUNGiE can do better.",1,1585331140,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq1n0q/giving_players_back_a_modicum_of_control_make/,DestinyTheGame,0

fq1f5z,Sourg,Fighting champions has many issues. How many more seasons will it take to fix them?,"This post will summarize some of the observations and issues with killing champions this season. Some points (e.g. anti-champion mods on exotic weapons) were brought up a lot on this sub, while some other ones - not so much.

In Seasons 8 and 9 we had an established meta with killing champions, especially being underleveled: divinity + x2 izanagi. If you were high enough power level, you could even do div + x1 izanagi with some buff, or quick swap to power weapon after the izanagi shot to secure the kill.

With izanagi's nerf in season 10, it's no longer the case. If you are underleveled, especially if it is 10-15 power lvl diff, x2 izanagi is not enough and you need some buff, like empowering rift (who runs it instead of healing rift in difficult activities with modifiers?) or high energy fire. In GM nightfalls we will be even more underleveled. There are some potential ways to still use x2 iza together with gg + celestial nighthawk, but then it significantly restricts your fireteam class composition, which is non-friendly to LFG.

Since x2 izanagi + div is less reliable now and greatly depends on your power level, community started exploring other options.

One of the biggest threats right now are barrier champions, since you need decent damage to break the shield, otherwise the champion will use a new shield just a couple of seconds after the previous one has ended. Barrier servitors who will shield adds/champions/bosses nearby make this threat even worse.

The issue here is very apparent:

**We lack reliable anti-barrier guns**. This season it's especially bad, because we have only two anti-barrier weapons, both of which are CQC: sidearms and SMGs. And you don't want to be CQC vs anti-barrier champions, especially underleveled, because they will delete you.

The only reliable anti-barrier weapon when underleveled is **Eriana's Vow -** amazing exotic (which by the way you cannot get anymore if you didn't play in season 8). It's the only special anti-barrier weapon we have in game. It does its job very well and is currently my irreplaceable companion for ordeals and hunts. Sadly, it's an exotic, so it restricts my load-out.

The fact that Eriana's Vow is so useful in these activities, makes another point very obvious:

**We lack anti-barrier special or power weapons**

If this was changed, it would open so many load-outs for high-end activities.

Since exotic weapons can't equip a mod, the choice of an exotic for these activities is very limited. The situation is especially bad with exotic primaries, because then you are forced to run double primary.

**We want to be able to use our favorite exotics**

Speaking of anti-champion mods, even when your weapon type is covered by the seasonal mod, you have to replace your favorite weapon mod (e.g. dragonfly spec, rampage spec, surrounded spec) with the artifact mod. Losing one of above-mentioned mods, decreases the value of the gun.

**We need to be able to use our favorite weapon mods together with anti-champion functionality.**

And the last one:

There is nothing fun about fighting anti-barrier servitor which shields 5+ more adds or even bosses or other champions. So is unloading half a magazine on constantly teleporting overload captain. It is simply frustrating. (overload swords are good though!)

# Suggestions

Now I will propose some ideas how to improve the gameplay vs champions:

\- Remove champion mods from weapons. I'd recommend not to move them to armor (we already have many armor mods which are integral parts of our builds). Instead have it as a passive buff which should obviously work with all weapons of the chosen type, including exotics.

\- Each season have both CQC and medium/long-range primaries to be used as anti-champion weapons, especially anti-barrier.

\- Add anti-champion functionality to special and power non-exotic weapons. At least for anti-barriers.

(If it wasn't Bungie, who has very different definition of ""play how you want to play"", than I do, I'd suggest to have all weapon types available for everything, but limit just the total number of selected weapon types and restrict from using one weapon type for everything. But knowing how feedback is usually being digested here, it's even more unrealistic than all other proposed ideas)

\- Before adding champions like barrier servitor or overload captains, ask your dev teams to do ordeals as a fireteam of realistic power level on Master (e.g. 1000 + 15) and GM difficulties (e.g. 1010 + 20). If you did, you would know, that it is not fun, it is frustrating experience.

# TLDR

\- Divinity + x2 izanagi is less meta now, especially when underleveled

\- Champions significantly restrict loadout

\- We still can't use our favorite exotics (especially exotic primaries) in activities with champions like ordeals or nightmare hunts

\- The choice of anti-champion weapons, especially anti-barrier ones, is sparse. This season it's 2 CQC options: sidearms and SMGs, or Eriana's Vow. In hard activities like Master or, in the future, GM Nightfalls CQC weapons are not a good option, because adds will delete you easily. We need range anti-barrier weapons.

\- We lack anti-barrier special and power weapons. Currently we have only one - Eriana's Vow, which is exotic, meaning it restricts your loadout.

\- Barrier servitors and overload captains are not fun, but frustrating.

I have no hope Bungie will ever fix any of this, but providing the feedback is the only thing we, as community, can do to try improving the game.

fq1agj,macho-dong,Trials Loot Rework Idea,"Since Trials loot needs a rework to reward both casual and high skill players, I thought about a system that rewards you at 3, 5, and 7 wins evenly, as well as flawless. 

At 3, 5, and 7 wins, you receive a curated weapon/fixed stat roll piece of armor, whatever the item for that tier is for the week. At flawless, it is added to the token loot pool. Once every item has been added to the loot pool by enough weeks of Trials going by, players still have incentive to play by farming tokens for engrams. However, if flawless is not something a player can obtain, they still have the curated roll/fixed stat roll armor. 

Ideally these fixed rolls would be middle of the pack in quality, not god rolls and not instant shards. Maybe for armor it could be a high stat total but an even distribution of stats, or a certain fixed total with randomized point allocation, favoring a random stat. For the weapons, they could have a good barrel/scope/magazine perk, with a good random perk, with the rest of the perks being average to keep them from dominating. 

I would also increase token rewards for higher win streaks to keep rewarding players as they progress.",0,1585330133,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq1agj/trials_loot_rework_idea/,DestinyTheGame,0

fq0zoa,En-Zu,6 Exotic Challenge! - Primary/Special/Power/Warlock/Hunter/Titan,"I thought this would be a fun game and format so I decided to get it started. Here's an example of the formatting. It would be nice when posting your own to comment and rate someone else's out of 5 that hasn't got theirs rated yet. Rating categories can be things like how Over/Under-Powered the item is, how Creative/Fun it is, and what Theme/Flavor it has.

1. Staring at the Sun - Solar Bow

Exotic perk: Gets damage buff while in a rift. Also increases dragonfly blast radius while standing in rift.


		○ Precision Frame
		○ Elastic String
		○ Straight Fletching
		○ No Distractions
		○ Dragonfly

Description: The idea is to be able to 1-shot guardians with a bow in crucible with an empowering rift (like le monarch) and making dragonfly more useful, while also being pretty decent in pve.


2. Newton's Apple: Kinetic Grenade Launcher

Perk: Everytime the grenade bounces, its blast radius increases. Slightly the first time, then greatly for subsequent bounces.

		○ Linear Compensator
		○ High Velocity Rounds/Concussion
		○ Quick Swap
		○ Demolitionist

Description: I just love grenade launchers. Demolitionist and quick swap are honestly really strong by themselves. The exotic perk I don't really see being that useful compared to its base perks (Demo is stronk) but being able to kill a whole team after 5 bounces seems pretty reasonable given how big your brain would have to be.

3. Durandal - Solar Sword 

Perk: Removes Barriers and Overloads Champions on hit. Causes a delayed Solar Explosion on kills.

		○ Adaptive Frame
		○ Jagged Edge
		○ Burst Guard
		○ Assassin's Blade
		○ Relentless Strikes

Description: This is probably too strong for pve tbh (which I don't really play) but I think the overload and barrier champions can really just be annoying to a solo player so this is kind of your jack of all trades remover. Justified I think because of how inherently risky swords are. The idea behind the delayed explosion is to uppercut enemies with the adaptive frame and turn them into kind of a missile.


4. The Killvisor - Titan Helmet 

Perk: You take reduced damage from critical damage hits and from bosses, vehicles, and supers, but your radar is removed.

Description: The idea is to just barely be able to survive a headshot from a non-aggressive frame sniper. This would be pretty annoying for snipers but I bet the trade-off would keep a lot of people from using it. In PvE this is basically the armor version of vorpal. Obviously a play on the killdozer.


5. Morn's Cowl - Hunter helmet

Perk: You take reduced damage from Hive enemies. If you are the last living member of your fire-team, you gain invisibility for 5 seconds after a precision kill and you also gain health.

Description: I think this captures the personality and story of Eris Morn pretty well and it's designed with my friend in mind who is really good at surviving (read: kind of a coward) and who is always last alive in the fireteam. She always does hive missions like the pit of heresy too.

6. Claw of the White Tiger - Warlock arms

Perk: Your jump height is increased and while airborne your melee range is greatly extended.

Description: I think these would be good for a close range blink build or an attunement of the sky build. You're often not able to use your melee in the air unless you use celestial fire. This is think helps to mitigate it while giving a bone to the  underappreciated warlock Kung Fu masters out there.",15,1585329247,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq0zoa/6_exotic_challenge/,DestinyTheGame,1

**What's a Xûr?**

Xûr, Agent of the Nine, is a strange vendor who randomly appears in a Public Sector in each of the Worlds, depending on the current Flashpoint. Xûr sells Exotic equipment and only takes Legendary Shards in exchange for them.

**TL;DR:** He's the Santa Claus of Destiny and every weekend is Christmas. Sometimes he brings you what you want, sometimes he brings you coal. Mostly it’s coal.

**When does Xûr visit?**

Xûr visits every Friday at 17:00 UTC and departs at reset. If you would like to see all the live conversions of Time Zones, please follow [this link here.](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc)

fq0qul,DTG_Bot,[D2] Trials of Osiris Megathread [2020-03-27],"#Trials of Osiris are LIVE

This thread is for all general discussion, questions, thoughts, musings, wonderings, etc. for the Trials of Osiris.

#FAQ

###What is Trials of Osiris?

 * Trials of Osiris is the pinnacle PvP activity. Every Weekend, the best players compete in 3v3 Elimination for one goal: Go Flawless.

 * To start, head to Saint-14 in the Tower Hangar and buy one of the possible passages (see below).

 * To reach Flawless and get to the Lighthouse, you need to win 7 matches without losing one.

 * It uses Win Based Matchmaking, which means you'll face teams with a similar amount of wins on their card. Matches will get harder as you win more matches.

 * There is NO fireteam matchmaking. You need to team up yourself!

 * Power Level matters, however bonus power from the artifact is not enabled.

###How Long do the Trials of Osiris last?

 * Event Starts: Every Friday at Daily Reset (1700 UTC).

 * Event Ends: Following Tuesday at Weekly Reset (1700 UTC).

###Where do I go to find Guardians to compete with in the Trials?

 * You can head over to /r/Fireteams, www.The100.io, Xbox LFG system, DestinyLFG.net or DestinyLFG.com, or go to the Bungie.net recruitment forum (also available through the Bungie App).

###What if I have a question about another piece of armor/weapon or general Trials question?

 * Use Control + F (Or Command + F if on a Mac) and search for keywords in your question. Someone may have asked it already. If they haven't ask right below.

fq0bwd,TSVenus,Being rewarded for playing Trials of Osiris,"Spoken from someone who has gone flawless a few times already, trials loot really needs a rework.

Aside from unlocking rewards at 3,5,7 wins. You are not rewarded for playing trials at all. Upon unlocking said gear, it becomes available in the loot pool for tokens redeemed at Saint-14. Which means only above average players will unlock gear for trials. 

Tokens are the big issue here. players who were unable to get 3 wins last week, even though playing multiple cards ( due to carry/recoveries and also shotgun gatekeepers, hardcore and streamers alike). We’re unable to gain any rewards even though amassing a mountain of unredeemable tokens. 

Tokens need to be redeemable, regardless of ticket wins. Trials gear needs to be earnable just from playing just like Trials of the Nine and D1 trials. 

Granted this is supposed to be the “elitism” game mode for PVP so there does need to be certain rewards locked to going flawless. But that’s where cosmetic rewards are, at the lighthouse.",13,1585327338,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq0bwd/being_rewarded_for_playing_trials_of_osiris/,DestinyTheGame,1
fq0bnh,neomedved,Real work is more efficient way to obtain Eververse items than farming bright dust.,"You need about 2-3 hours to complete Vanguard, Crucible and Gambit weekly bounties on one character, which give you 1200 bright dust (plus some dust for repeatable bounties). So you need about 6-9 hours to get 3600+ bright dust. One exotic emote costs 3250 bright dust or 1000 silver. Finally, 1100 silver costs $10. So you are getting in-game equivalent of about $10 for 6-9 hours of farming. And you know, $1.1-1.7 per hour doesn’t sound like a great salary for me.

3 - Class item - will be an early win reward since it's literally just cosmetic and shouldn't ever be a high win reward

5 - Sniper. I dont think they'd want to gate weapons at high wins since it's back to the rich get richer that they want to avoid like with LH/NF

7 - Repeat weapon. Maybe the scout? Was at one point easy to get at 3 wins but now just a ""higher end"" drop from being pinnacle

fq01t5,pdoggaming,"Bungie, here are some ideas.","I have been a long time player since day 1 and I love this game. Currently, the game is in a state where it doesn't feel challenging nor rewarding to its players, but not bad by all means. As a long time fan and someone who knows the ins and outs of what people liked I think some of my ideas could benefit the game for the better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly to address the issue of the game being too easy maybe add another higher difficulty (let's say grandmaster to connect with the nightfall) this new difficulty could reward maybe something like pinnacle tier 2 or something like that. This new difficulty would also have a level scaler that no matter what your light is it averages the light of everyone on the team and adds 20 light level to the raid. this could also add multiple phases to each encounter like with Aksis back in D1. So let's say GoS each encounter would be 20 light higher than the average light of the team (with a base power to avoid exploiting) and the encounters would essentially double due to new phases. I think this new tier of raids could bring back the feeling of satisfaction after spending hours doing a raid that people (at least that I know) have had. You could also do something like this for other activities to make things like public events and dungeons more exiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, to address the issue of players not feeling rewarded after playing the game for hours you could reintroduce pinnacle weapons just like recluse or MT in strength but introduce them as a new rarity of weapon and make it where you can only have one equipped, but no exotics so that you could pair a weapon almost on the level of exotics with your favorite exotic. In an interview, it was said if a new rarity was to come it would be black so this would be a great chance to introduce something with a black rarity you could even give it an interesting name like master weapons, or triumph tier or something to show their strength and the difficulty they require to receive. Also, I personally think raid weapons are not as good or top tier as in the past, the community needs a new Fatebringer, Vision of Confluence, black spindle, etc. so maybe there could be an overhaul that makes new weapons for this aforementioned grandmaster raid difficulty. These weapons could have rarer ""Adept"" versions that have elements in the primary slot and could have similar to pinnacle weapons perks, but there could also be the non-adept version so people could get random rolls on the weapons they want. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thirdly, and maybe most importantly, the exotic problem. The exotic problem, in my opinion, is one of the biggest issues with destiny in its current state. I remember a time back in Destiny 1 where Exotics were a mystery no roadmap that says exactly what it is and when it will come, no collections tab that says what weapons or armor is coming, nothing. that feeling in early D1 ""OH I GOT THE SUROS, RED DEATH, I GOT THE GJALLARHORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" everything was a mystery and all the weapons were goo enough to be a choice on what you use now exotics are just legendary weapons where every once and a while one or two are above average but never as good as the recluse or the mountaintop so I suggest a revamp maybe 2-3 a season rework an exotic of the communities choice so post a poll on twitter or something and rework those weapons and make them good again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourthly, the seasonal content issue. Leave future content from seasons to the imagination leave the things you guys think most important to yourselves until they come out. For example this season you could have just said Bunker 1,2,3 don't give locations just small things like that tell the community what is coming but don't tell us ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Also, bounties should not be the main way to complete the season I think the reviewing warming bits from games like crucible and strikes is a good in lore way to give alternatives to bounties maybe have Ana Bray say something like ""as you complete activities throughout the system you will be arming Rasputin with the resources you find in your adventures."" To be honest, just drop the ""bits"" from being the way to progress the season make different questlines that all run through the season and all connect into one Final thing that concludes the season's arc and introduces the next season.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, Bungie, I love you guys and love this game and I truly think as it has in the past Destiny will recover from the issues that plague it right now and I think if you take some of my suggestions or simply listen to the community then everything will be all right. I also understand with the lake of funding from Activision things are harder to do so please don't take this post as a just fix it post. I believe that you guys are in a better place when it comes to inspiration than you have been since Halo so with that energy and the community you have built up together can make Destiny the best.

fq01ss,BC1096,"(Spoiler) Ana Bray and the gang go on an adventure for answers, and all they find is terrible things! Sometimes it's better for things to be forgotten, or to never know the truth.","**This post contains information regarding lore from Bungie.net. At the VERY END of this post there will be MAJOR SPOILERS. They will be marked when it starts, so you are safe to read the vast majority**

**There is no TL;DR, this is really, really, really long and I even cut out huge chunks of the lore tabs. Yes, really. I highly encourage you read it, not because I wrote it, but because this opens your eyes to Ana Bray and Clovis Bray.**

Decided to post this one early since I have the free time. 

Our favorite former Clovis Bray Scientist and her gang decide to go on an adventure, this time looking for the famed Atlas. Atlas was the ""journal"" of Clovis Bray himself, and is assumed to have every little secret the organization ever had. 

With the help of Jinju (her Ghost) and Big Red (Rasputin) they decide to check out a new signal coming out of Mars.

It probably wasn't a good idea.

**Legacy Pt.1**

This whole thing starts off with Ana walking through a sandstorm (or some kind of storm) following the trace of an energy signature, a significant one. 

Upon arrival of the location, they realize there is no one around, no biometric activity. Completely abandoned, and they are surprised by this (and delighted).

They assume the power is being generated through Geothermal means, because of how much it is, and because there is an active Volcano near by.

They get inside, and immediately realize they are at a Clovis Bray site. Clovis-9. Ana is perplexed because she thought she had seen all of the Clovis Bray sites.

They enter a room and notice a vault like door had been blown open. Upon further analysis they realize it had to have happened during the Golden Age, long time ago. The mechanism used had to be very sophisticated to break through the door in the manner that it did.  They do another scan, and make the conclusion that whatever did this isn't around anymore.

Their goal at this point is to try and find an access point in which Rasputin can gain access to the facility and the info stored inside, but they can't find one. Eventually Jinju goes and restores power to the building, they enter an elevator and descend deeper into the complex.

When they get down they are greeted with the sight of servers, a lot of them. Ana gets excited because she thinks they actually stumbled upon Atlas. However, the servers were shielded and being powered externally. Jinju makes the remark that it is weird that essential servers would be on auxiliary power.

They enter the ""Pillory Mainframe: Paragon"", and notice that there had been a gun fight here. But the bullets all went in one direction.

Power is restored, and the door in front of them scans Ana, identifies her based off her Clovis ID, and opens.

**Sometimes it's better for things to be forgotten**

There's three bodies on the floor. Three exo's. In the middle of the bodies was the Golden Age device used to break into the vault door earlier in the facility. The Exo's were wearing Braytech uniforms, and Ana notices an ID on one of their belts.

""0220-17, ECHO PROJECT, PARAGON CLEARANCE""

They used this ID to enter the elevator and get down here. But Echo Project is not something Ana is familiar with, in fact she had never seen it mentioned in any other Clovis site or Database she had encountered. Now off the bat this whole situation is odd, Exo's in Clovis Uniforms broke into this place during the Golden Age, had a shoot out and died, but their bodies were left here and they had special clearance for this shadow project.

Now at this point this is weird, but then the awful series of events and revelations starts here.

Power turns back on. Instantly a robotic voice asks for their ID. Ana. having no idea what's going on panics and uses the very convincing response of ""I don't know!""

Then she says her name ""Bray, Anastasia""

They get scanned. 

""Anomalous Entity Detected. Rogue Mind Detected""

Now let's freeze frame right here, so we understand why this is weird. There's only one person in the room (Ana), then her Ghost (Jinju), and Rasputin is in her helmet. There's only one ""Mind"" here, and apparently it's a Rogue one. Hey Ana, some advice, maybe let's not walk blindly into sketchy places. She doesn't take that advice.

Immediately after Robot Voice says it's detected a Rogue Mind, two turrets drop out of the sealing and open fire on Ana.

Ana being a Guardian and very skilled, shits on the turrets with little to no problem.

But the fact she tripped a security alarm is weird. Why? Because she is/was Ana Bray. One of the main figures of the entire organization. It couldn't be her, right? Like I said, there's only one Mind in the room.

Naturally, she decides they need to look for answers. They use the Echo ID to get into the main room and access a console. 

Revelation #1: Echo Project has 12 sites, Clovis 1-12, they are currently on 9.

Revelation #2: Echo Project sites are completely removed from Warmind network. They are independent from Rasputin. This is strange because Rasputin is Clovis made, and the best defense AI Humanity has ever seen. Why not integrate?

Revelation #3: The sites are all over the place. Earth, the Moon, Europa, Asteroids in the Tangled Shore, Mars and as far out as Uranus.

One of said stations, an orbital station, has a pending Echo request. There is also indication of a ""Redline Protocol"" which Ana has also never heard of.

**Redline Protocol**

&gt;In the event of a catastrophic failure, neural degeneration, or loss of containment, herein collectively referred to as a [ROGUE MIND] incident, initiates [WARMIND CEREBRAL PARTITIONING] and [QUARANTINE INTEGRATION] into twelve CLOVIS station(s) within [NEURAL WEB-WAY]. 

Now in the event of a ""Rogue Mind incident"", there is the Echo Contingency. The gist is that if they detect a Rogue Mind, Echo severs all connections to not be compromised. Now at this point we don't know what the Echo Project is, but we know that the Redline Protocol happens in the same case. Redline protocol is designed to partition a Warmind's...mind and quarantine it at 12 different locations.

In other words, our friend Big Red is considered a Rogue Mind, and this Redline Protocol was activated, causing his mind to be scattered in 12 different places. We know this because we actually reversed this (unknowingly) when we re-established Rasputin with all (or most) of his fragments. (People consider this a retcon because Charlemagne ended up being just a piece of Rasputin, instead of a separate Warmind. Also they all had individual names, anyway doesn't matter now because they are all Rasputin). 

They figure out a way to get Rasputin into the facilities database, so he can look through his own brain, or whatever part of his brain was at the facility. Ana notices all of the connections are one way, and all of them are closed systems. Meaning she would manually have to go to all 12 sites to connect them all.

Hey, wasn't there a site that had an Echo request pending? Well, it just so happens to be falling out of orbit and crashing into Uranus. They've got 42 days to get there and get whatever info they can. The distress signal coming from it was not automated however, it was manual.

**Alright, that wasn't the most interesting thing in the world**

I know, but it had critical information about the situation at hand. Rasputin was deemed to be Rogue and not functioning properly during the Golden Age (probably during the Collapse). He's still flagged as such.

**I get it, but where are all these terrible things you mentioned in the title**

Oh boy, buckle down cause shit goes downhill right off the bat on this next part.

**Legacy Pt. 2** 

(The longest lore post in Destiny history as far as I am concerned)

They are on their way to Uranus and talking on Ana's ship. Jinju confirms the Exo's are in fact Golden Age, circa The Collapse. 

She also confirms that ""Pillory"" (has to do with Redline) was made to separate Rasputin in the case he became ""insubordinate"". Ana says it's ""disgusting"", but she's also biased.

Probably should have waited for the full explanation before saying that.

&gt;“ECHO appears to have been a contingency program that activates afterward. They also had a cornerstone schematic of his brain.”

&gt;Ana chews on the information for a moment. “A foundational brain model would help with containment stability after the partitioning process. It’s like a front porch for your brain.”

&gt;“It… goes on.” Jinju continues, “Your name is cross-referenced all over this, Ana. Neural Web-way. Psycholinguistics. Exo brain maps with candidate profiles. It looks like Clovis Bray was syncing Rasputin’s basic core with viable hosts.”

Hey remember that ""disgusting"" thing you just talked about. You were one of the main people who made it.

&gt;“Oh.” Ana’s mind races. “For what though? Drop him into containment and clone him? Pretty elaborate restart button. I guess with an Exo you could also make some pretty potent AI with more limiters than a Warmind.”

Then they talk about her friend(?) Camrin, who works in Owl Sector

**WHY DOES THAT MATTER**

Ana calling something disgusting and then being involved in it is foreshadowing the fact they are currently talking about someone who is actively investigating the Lunar Pyramid. You don't say? Pyramid?

You wanna guess what happens next?

&gt;Jinju perks up, internal sensors suddenly askew.  “Something nabbed us right out of our jump. We’re off course by…” Jinju calculates, “…three AU?”

&gt;“What!?” Ana manually scans the trajectory equations in the nav-computer. “There’s nothing wrong with the math.”

&gt;||JUMP-DRIVE ERROR: MISALIGNMENT|| squawks on bubble speakers.

&gt;“Little late.”

&gt;Tart synesthetic tickle creeps red and patient. Low and pressing, as not to be heard by those that might be listening.

&gt;“Relax. I know we’re off course, but it’s not that far… relatively speaking.” Ana scrunches her face at a nav-screen as it’s overtaken by interference. “Okay, I can’t see where we are. Hang on.”

&gt;A slow wrinkle skulks across space. It presses up the fabric. Insignificant points between stars warp and spur small disturbances in the constellational congruence of the galaxy. From afar it is nothing. A flutter of wings in wind. 

&gt;“It’s dark out here.” Jinju’s voice is distant as she peers outside. Beyond the canopy an expanse without horizon.

&gt;“That’s when the stars shine brightest, Jinju. Find a constellation for me so we can get our bearings.”
||GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ANOMALY DETECTED: JUMP-REALIGNMENT REQUIRED||

**Knock knock, guess who's here!**

&gt;“Feel’s strange.” Jinju is distant. “We should go.”

&gt;Ana initiates recalibrations on the jump-drive’s positioning solution. “There’s definitely some weird space out there.”

&gt;||GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ANOMALY DETECTED||

&gt;The ship lurches. Ana’s stomach churns. Jinju vibrates violently in place, an outer shell of Light absorbing some form of force.

&gt;Red iron needles whistle tea-kettle pressure in white anxiety from Ana’s helmet.

&gt;Cloaked Shadows shift through the vacuum an eternity away and all too close; shown only when they wish to, to only whom they want.

&gt;Ana swallows to settle her stomach. “What even was that? Did we move?”

&gt;“Leave. Now please. Ana.” Jinju presses against the glass of the canopy, peering outward.

&gt;||SYSTEM REALIGNMENT: SOLUTION SECURED||

&gt;“There it is. I’ve got a jump-lock.”

&gt;||GRAVITATIONAL WAVE ANOMALY DETECTED||

**Translation: Bitch RUN**

&gt;“Again? Then we’re riding this one out of here.” Ana eye-balls adjustments for the gravitational wave into the nav-computer. “Punching jump in 3… 2… 1…”

&gt;They slip between folds in space. Formless wake propels them. The ship rides through sub-space at speeds far exceeding her jump-drive's capability. Color dulls in the slipstream. Frisson electrifies Ana's senses into timeless euphoria. The nose of the cockpit stretches ahead, drawn toward some distant vanishing point. She struggles to keep the flight stick straight. Her motions seem small, inconsequential and all too slow within the wave. Fluctuant pockets of drag flex and buck, threatening to throw them off into the unknown. The cockpit twists around her, indicator lights blink in metronomic sequence—purpose and pigment slowly materializing in her mind. 

&gt;Hull integrity failing. ""Not yet.""

&gt;||COLLISION: BOW, CELESTIAL BODY DETECTED, AUTO-DROP FAILED||

They make it out of the jump and are in the orbit of Uranus.

**Not out of the woods yet**

&gt;“Those are Warsats.” Jinju breaks the silence, eager to shift her mode of thought far from weird space and gravity waves.

&gt;“Finally, some luck,"" Ana says with relief. ""I bet we can daisy-chain Rasputin into the station’s network through the defense system.”

&gt;“Oh, they’re powering up. Maybe we—”

&gt;Horns of responsive distortion roll across the cabin like a stress wave. Rasputin’s alert pings litter the canopy HUD.

&gt;“Brace!”

They have to deal with a bunch of Warsats shooting them on site. They shoot ""Spikes"" at them to allow Rasputin to hack them and use them to help defend. They are successful and are now near Caelus Station, their destination.

&gt;Jinju emerges from the gunnery apparatus and floats back to the dashboard. Pho and Deim appear from under her shell. “What was that, Ana? Back there.”

&gt;“The Warsats or the freaky gravity?”

&gt;“Either… both.”

&gt;“Your guess is as good as mine.”

&gt;“My guess worries me.”

&gt;“Let’s just pull this data and get home.”

&gt;“Agreed.”

&gt;Ana hangs her head in her hands and muffles a sardonic, “Nailed it.”

Hey man, I don't know about you, but judging by the way things are going off the bat, maaaaybeee this isn't a great idea to be both this far out and be at this station.

Just a thought.

They got on the station, and it's strange. There are 3 biomes, there are greenhouses. Everything is locked under a file named ""Contingency"". It seems this place was never inhabited. It exists as a back up. Guess no one made it, right?

**Now let's get creepy**

&gt;The bay is still: a snapshot of countless possible failures in the face of challenge. It holds only one ship.  The bulbous craft lay broken, dropped from its support brackets in denial of an attempted launch. Reflective hexagonal plates sparkle like space dust as the station faces Uranus' light. Scorch stains blacken the far wall behind the craft's ruined ion thruster.

&gt;""The propulsion system is missing its ion cell. It doesn't look like damage, but obviously a lot went wrong here.""

&gt;Jinju beams light over the fuselage as they float through the ruptured bay in weightlessness.  The reflective hull is filled with Exos. Mannequin cadavers hang frozen on silk threads, surrounded by globular blobs of various fluids. Loose-wire tangle sags around the lifeless many. One or two glides freely within the cabin. Their chest plates share a pristine logo. ""Echo-1"".

Mannequin Cadavers. Human bodies? Are they referring to the Exo's as Mannequin Cadavers? If one of you can tell me I'd appreciate it.

They find a Frame (think Redjacks, Sweeperbot, etc. Those are Frames), crumpled over, dead. Jinju looks into it and finds out this isn't just some Frame, it's the station manager. So Jinju decides to try and get power to the Frame and reactivate it. Maybe they can get some information.

&gt;The Frame sparks to life, looks directly at Ana, and speaks with grating age to its voice.

&gt;“Welcome, Ana Bray! Very excited to see a Bray walk this hall again. It has been a long time.”

&gt;Ana grasps at words. Jinju shrugs, plugs of Light toss in zero-G.

&gt;The Frame stands on magnetized foot cups and dusts itself off, nearly bumping into Jinju. “Excuse me, small servo bot.""

&gt;“Servo b?""

&gt;The Frame turns to Ana. “How may I be of assistance?""

&gt;“I’ll unplug you.”

&gt;The Frame ignores her.

&gt;Ana smirks at Jinju, then looks at the Frame.

&gt;""Walk with me,"" she says, briskly moving deeper into the station.

&gt;The two converse with Jinju in tow.

They get to the main section of the station and are greeted by a sign in large red letters

&gt;Echo Project: Our Legacy Builds The Horizon

So what's the station for?

&gt;Ana stares out the translucent ceiling, wistful as the Frame waits for another question.

&gt;“So those crops in the rings are food supplies for a colony mission.""

&gt;""Yes. Thank you for asking that, Ana Bray.""

&gt;""Yeah. And the colony ships are full of Exos?""

&gt;""Partially. ECHO-1 and ECHO-2 were stocked with Exo unit crews. As you know, their task was to establish and oversee embryonic development at Colony M31, Site-A and Site-B.""

&gt;""If Rasputin got out of hand, they weren't planning on resetting him.”

&gt;""I don’t have access to Clovis 1-12 directories.""

&gt;“They just assumed he would win. The Pillory is a last-ditch panic room.”

&gt;""I don’t have access to Clovis 1-12 directories.""

&gt;Jinju’s iris flicks back and forth between the two. Her tiny Light-leash hums.

&gt;Ana massages her palm. “What was my role in all this?”

&gt;“As you know, your work on the Warmind made you a prime asset to oversee **applicant selection**.”

&gt;“I chose the people in there?”

&gt;Ana watches the ringlet spin, her mind repeating the statement back to her. Artificial night slips back to artificial day as the station's rotation continues.

&gt;“As you know, yes. Additionally, your work on the Warmind, as you know, was vital to the establishment of Clovis 1-12.”

&gt;“Do I know where the candidates came from? Did they volunteer?”

&gt;“I do not have access to candidate profiles.”

&gt;Ana shuts her eyes and takes a steady breath.

Ana is really regretting this decision to come here, and that ""disgusting"" comment is REALLY coming back to slap her in the face.

&gt;“You said I helped with the Pillory stations?”

&gt;“Yes.”

&gt;“How so?”

&gt;""I don’t have access to Clovis 1-12 directories.""

&gt;She nods and lets her helmet slink back to rest on her shoulders. “I think I can piece it together on my own. Is this station linked to any other sites?”

&gt;Her gaze returns to the distant ringlet, lit by the recurring planet-rise. Her augmented eyes pick at details.

&gt;“As you know, Miss Bray, there are thirteen CLOVIS sites that this station is linked to.”

&gt;“Thirteen? What’s the thirteenth?”

Every where it says 12, this Frame said 12, but now there is 13? Well, let's do simple math. 1-12 were satellite sites that were separated from each other so each part of Rasputin was quarantined and cut off from the others. So if 12 of them were parts, there had to be a center for all of it. Cue #13.



&gt;The plant life is still vibrant. Regimented

&gt;“Paragon access does not permit that information.”

&gt;“You hear that, Jinju? We’re all just slaves to circumstance.”

I wonder if that statement will also come back to be a slap to the face? Hmmm.

&gt;Jinju chirps. “I’d like to think our choices matter a little. I’d like to think mine did.”

&gt;Ana smiles at her. “Yeah.”

&gt;“You are a Bray.” The frame pauses. 

&gt;They lack signs of overgrowth. 

&gt;Well kept.

&gt;“So?” Ana turns to the Frame.

&gt;“ECHO project requires a station link with &lt;VERBAL CIPHER ENGAGED&gt; DEAD-ROCK &lt;VERBAL  CIPHER DISENGAGED&gt; resources.”

&gt;Ana eyes go wide. “Jinju disengage that cipher thing.” Over her shoulder, a glint shines from the far central ringlet. Biome 2.

You ever played Battlefield? If you have, you know what a glint in the distance means.

&gt;Jinju glides forward. “What is that?”

&gt;Ana looks at Jinju. “The verbal cipher.” She pauses and traces Jinju’s eyeline to face Uranus. Ana’s eyes adjust to sieve out the glaring brightness. “What’s what?” She puts a hand to her visor and squints.

&gt;An ion lance threads the station from the distant ringlet.

&gt;It pierces Ana’s chest clean through.

Oh Ana, let's plan things better in the future. This had bad news written all over it from the moment they walked through the vault door on Clovis-9 back on Mars. This has been an awful experience. And now you just got sniped in the chest.

Surely it can't get any worse...right?

Now, stick with me here, because details matter here.

Echo-1 was on the chest of those dead Exo's on that ship. Pay attention to the headers of the segments. Also pay attention to what I put in **bold**.

**Echo-0**

&gt;He awakens alone. A fluke. Others hang around Him, **but they remain in the dream**. **Electrical surge prickles through his entire body**. A screen in front of his face begins playing a recording complete with visual aid:

&gt;""Welcome to ECHO-1. Before your departure, you should have been briefed by a Station **Warden** If you don't recall your Station **Warden**, please alert your Crew Captain. Now then, my name is **Ana Bray, and you're one of the lucky few who has been selected for the ECHO Project. The future of Humanity rests on your sho—""**

&gt;The recording is interrupted as emergency sirens blare through the station.

&gt;""STATION HAZARDS: **GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALY | STERILE NEUTRINO BURSTS** | Please remain calm.""

&gt;""OVERRIDE BROADCAST: via ECHO-LINK//:**PILLORY-SUBLOCK**.R.R//:**SKYSHOCK ALERT**: TRANSIENT NEAR EXTRASOLAR EVENT:—

&gt;Power failures wrack the station in rolling thunder. The Exo slumps, lifeless **until its next reset**.

**Echo-7**

&gt;**Alone.** 

&gt;The recording. He finds familiarity in the newness. **The face on the screen seems kind**—

&gt;""STATION HAZARDS: ROLLING SURGES IN WARDS 1, 2, 3. Please remain calm.""

&gt;Thunder. Pain to death. Electro-static purge, triggering a reset. 

**Echo-22**

&gt;He awakens to rolling, thunderous darkness and pain. The screen does not illuminate.

&gt;Barely audible words form from the air:

&gt;""Primary propulsion systems failing. Auxiliary systems near depletion. Planetary impact unavoidable. Distress triggered.""

&gt;Meaningless. **He struggles against chains.** 

&gt;Eons pass. **His bonds will not break. His mind fragments and corrupts.**

&gt;**He wishes he could bleed. He wishes he could die**. He wonders where the **Wardens** are.

**Echo-41**

&gt;Short lives of confusion and pain. He grasps at falling in every direction. There is nothing to grip,

**Echo-89**

&gt;Thunder, again.

**Echo-173**

&gt;and again.

**Echo-390**

&gt;Until one day: 

&gt;He hangs in the futile passage of time.

&gt;**A creeping madness weaves its way in solitude.**

**Echo-877**

&gt;Thunder. Thunder. Thunder. 

The Warden speaks for the first time in many storms. Her twisted promises are fresh to His ear. 

""When we return."" Etched in mind.

&gt;**Wake and sleep. Struggle. Dream and wake. Struggle.** Endless. Innumerable. Stillbirths. **Tomb** spasms. Thunderous pain. Sweet death.

**Echo-2625**

&gt;Thunder, one final time. The storm gives life, but never came to take.

&gt;He slips from rot shackles. Worn with age. Weary, they snap at slightest motion. Untold rotations pass without movement. Freedom?

&gt;He matures questions. A hunger wells up within him.

&gt;He travels the station. From Tomb Bay, to the Mind Shell, to the Sealed Space. In dark, and in light.

&gt;The **Mind Shell** teaches Him the new roads. Teaches Him the majesty of the Rings. **Teaches him the key.**

&gt;He walks the Rings. 

&gt;He tends to His little freedoms. He cultivates. He grows. He does, unknowingly, as He was meant to do.

&gt;The **Mind Shell** tells Him of the Bridge. **Tells him of His ancestors. Speaks of the ""ECHO LINK"".**

&gt;The knowledge does not leave His thoughts.

&gt;He seeks a meaning beyond routine.

&gt;The Tomb Bay kept secrets. He had not returned since He walked the Rings. It is a shallow sepulcher.	

&gt;**Brothers and Sisters dreaming. Never to wake as He had.**

&gt;He digs treasures from their graves. Digs knowledge **from the Prison's many minds.** 

&gt;Picks lies from the bones of truth.

&gt;He drinks the memories of Echoes passed.

&gt;**He finds the Prison's purpose. A Bridge's end. If He holds this end, perhaps the Wardens hold the other.**

&gt;The many minds. The liar's words. Takers. They would know of his escape. 

&gt;The **Wardens** would come to take with fresh shackles.

&gt;He prepares. He learns from the **Warden's** alchemy.

&gt;**He digs through the carcass of his once-mighty Tomb.**

&gt;From hollow basin, He seizes Starlight power to wield from afar. From its flesh: adorns Himself with a cloak of lies to fool. He armors his soul against the Thunder that kills.

&gt;He opens the Bridge at his end and waits.

**Echo-2625 (Present Day)**

&gt;He walks the ring when She arrives.

&gt;**The Warden** rides in with finality and judgement. 

&gt;**A red-light storm at Her back.**

&gt;She had followed the Bridge, as He had hoped. She leads many shells, but only One descends with Her.

&gt;**She brings with Her the Thunder**, and He fears its wicked spark. He places trust to his plated frame.

&gt;He watches Her trespass in the Tomb Bay. Sees Her defile the Mind Shell's grand hall. 

&gt;**The Wardens reap what had been sown.**

&gt;As Wardens always do.  She comes to collect him.

&gt;He raises his Starlight.

&gt;But a Warden is not so easily slain, and She has many allies.

A lot to digest here. I know it's a lot, but it is important not to leave anything out. Let's take it from the top. Echo-1 and Echo-2, their task was to establish and oversee **embryonic development** at Colony M31, Site-A and Site-B. The sites don't mean anything at this moment, their task is important. They were going to rebuild human life, because they expected Rasputin to destroy it all, or let it all be destroyed. That's why the Echo Project was completely independent. That's why it was the Echo Contingency. What to do when we lost, not if.

Ana was one of the main people in charge of the whole thing, and she chose the people here. Now, if they were volunteers the Frame would have probably said. It didn't, and I am pretty sure Ana knew the answer to that before she said it. Sometimes it's better for things to be forgotten.

That being said, she didn't have full access to everything about the project. She had ""Paragon"" level access, she knew who to choose, where the sites were, but not everything about the project. Basing it off that these people weren't here voluntarily, I'd hazard to say they didn't voluntarily choose to be Exo's. This is Clovis Bray after all.

The Frame can't tell her something and requires Ana to have a verbal cipher to unlock it. Obviously, not being the Ana Bray of the Golden Age, she doesn't know it. But we know that the Echo station requires a link to something classified. Frame could talk about sites 1-12. but not 13. Seems classified to me.

Back in the action Ana comes too, but is losing a lot of blood, and oxygen, and realizes she's been shot.

Rasputin is pissed off at this point and literally deletes everything within ten meters of where the shot came from.

While Ana is receiving aid, she is working with Rasputin to figure out where the shooter is. Rasputin realizes the person has Active Camo.

Echo-2625 (that's a lot of resets), decides he needs to make sure the Warden is dead, and moves for the kill.

&gt;A ceiling panel twenty meters from Ana erupts in brittle plastic shards that glisten and spin like tiny neutron stars, catching the last of Uranus' light as the station beings to turn dark. Amorphous form thuds into the floor, shattering tiles in a plume of dust that stretches up into a spire before slowly holding in place. The form tumbles to a stop. It stands between her and the open launch bay and slings a kit-bashed Ion caster aside, depleted. Hexagonal patterns stutter to blend with the station interior as the room rolls into tenebrous obscurity. For an instant, an Exo takes form, and then nothing as its cloaking shroud flashes and re-engages in the dark.

&gt;Behind.

&gt;She spins as the Exo crashes through the secondary entrance at her back. The door snaps from its hinges in a torrent of dust and rackets Jinju into glass. 

&gt;""Jinju!""

&gt;Ana loses track of her attacker momentarily in the darkness before it pushes off from a hard surface, triggering her visor. She spits off rounds from 18 Kelvins. Some find their mark, puncturing the camouflage shroud and revealing her adversary before impotently fizzling on the Exo's outer shell. It covers the gap with surprising speed and catches her gun hand; Ana discharges an arc round; tiny bolts reach across to the Exo’s metal skull in vain as it scorches ceiling. 

&gt;Bones pop in her fingers and wrist.

&gt;The Exo flattens its other hand and stabs toward her stomach. 

&gt;""Die. Warden.""

&gt;Adrenal instinct floods Ana's body. She stops it. They lock. Ana’s vision blurs. She gasps for breath. Muscles quiver in her arms, desperate for oxygen. A spark cinders in her.

&gt;""Get off her!""

&gt;Jinju zips toward the Exo and paddles Pho and Deim onto it with a flick of her shell. The mites crawl under the Exo's exterior plating and send shock-sting bites through its systems, seizing its joints for a few precious seconds.

&gt;Jinju rushes to Ana's side. The Ghost deconstructs itself, orbital shell bits swirl around a core of coalescing Light. She fills the room like a brilliant star, overcharging her wayward Guardian. 

&gt;Ana's crushed bones reforge. Light fills her eyes. Her grip, still holding against the seizing Exo's bladed thrust, liquefies its plated hand to scrap. A glorious crown of Solar flame erupts from her visor and she cracks her forehead into the Exo’s face. It reels, tufts of flame extinguish in the vacuum. Ana kicks away. 

&gt;Solar might engulfs 18 Kelvins. Ana hammers off two rounds of celestial annihilation. They melt straight through the Exo, puncture the station plating, and scream through space for light years.

&gt;The Exo slumps, a molten heap.

&gt;It draws breath.

&gt;“Resilient.” Ana drops to a knee. Barrel trained on the Exo's head.

&gt;She takes a full breath. The Exo’s eyes are unflinchingly locked to her. It refuses to die.

&gt;It points to Ana’s badge with its still-blistering hand.

&gt;“Bray. Warden.”

&gt;She says the only thing the can think to say: “Who were you?” 

&gt;It hesitates. “Echoes.” 

&gt;Her head droops. “How many did you live?” She looks to find his number designation, but it is missing.

&gt;It looks passed her as Uranus' light once again trickles through the station.** “Echoes… grow… Wardens… keep…”**

&gt;“What did I do to them?”

Ana realizes whatever the hell she did was probably so terrible and inhumane that she probably doesn't even want to know. This guy, who lived for eons being tortured, dying over and over again. He hates Rasputin, her Thunder. The Thunder that gives life but does not take. He was a prisoner, and Ana his Warden. He wanted revenge for what she had done, he wanted revenge for his brothers and sisters. Revenge for all the lies.

Ana is absolutely having an awful day. Now it's decision time. What now?

&gt;Ana stares at Echo’s husk. The faint glow of the desk's lit console screen grays out her face behind her visor.

&gt;She sits dead-still in rotation. She could stare forever, if she only had enough time.

&gt;Jinju nudges her shoulder. “I've got the mainframe data.”

&gt;Ana is devoid of thought at the mainframe access console. She watches as Uranus comes back into view over and over again. It dominates the station’s viewing port. She maps the movement of the clouds along the surface, but only ever on the surface, and sees how they differ from the previous iteration on their last spin. She wonders if they are different underneath.

&gt;Stable major chords strum in Ana’s helmet, getting caught in the cracked visor glass.

&gt;She finally speaks, decisive. “Dislodge the other ringlet paddocks. Warsats can tow them back to the Tower. Skim the shadow-networks for anything else they can use. Get some good from this…”

&gt;“Ana, the Warsats could haul this whole station as long as we do it soon.”

&gt;Caelus rotates away into shadow once again, and the planet’s sheen fades from sight. Ana clicks a spring-loaded slot on the desk. It snaps to, bearing a placard of ownership. 

&gt;""Clovis Bray""

&gt;Ana stands. Steady.

&gt;“It’s okay to let some things be forgotten.”

She doesn't want anyone to know who she was, and now she probably doesn't either. She has been trying to find out who she was since she was revived with her ID on her. She thought she had left a positive legacy, played a major part in helping create the single greatest human creation, Rasputin.

Instead, she found out she was no better then anyone else at Clovis Bray. She was no hero. Maybe Rasputin isn't one either, if she was a part of a program made to escape him. Maybe this was all a mistake.

**THIS IS NOW THE PORTION THAT CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS, feel free to avoid it if you don't want to be spoiled. This pertains to my post yesterday regarding Rise of Iron and Felwinter's Lie**

I just wanted to put this in at the end (of a ridiculously long post) because it was something I noticed last night that blew my mind.

Read this: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/lord-timur?highlight=lord+timur

If you read my post yesterday, that should sound suspiciously familiar.

Now go and read this (only the bottom section, with the Dark Age header): https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48809

There were comments about how Felwinter's story was a retcon on his character. The first lore tab is from Rise of Iron's release. This story has literally been there since the start. And now that you know everything about who Felwinter really is, it becomes so obvious. I found it incredible that they actually picked up the exact same moment, and added all the depth. The first one is what Timur saw, the second is what Felwinter saw. Two different perspectives on the same story. Timur didn't know he almost died, that's why it's not mentioned in his lore piece. But they line up perfectly.

I don't know about you, but that blew my mind. Really solid work from Bungie.",161,1585326524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fq01ss/spoiler_ana_bray_and_the_gang_go_on_an_adventure/,DestinyTheGame,3

fpzq34,Hindufury,Say what you will about Trials but it makes Iron Banner feel great!,"The past two weeks of Trials had me feeling kind of low.  the best I could do was 3 wins the first week and I was struggling to get one last week.  My buds and I are getting better at coordination but Trials is hard and it can left me feeling very bitter about PvP.

It is a very different animal from the other crucible modes except of course for elimination.  So IB this week was a nice surprise.  I roll with the clan and I can see that the work put in in Trials doesn't necessarily lead to success there but in IB those skills are allowed to manifest!

It reminds me of med school.  Prior to it everyone in med school is a real smarty but since they're all in an environment of smarties they get stratified.  They're really good at what they do but there will always be a bottom rank and a top rank person.

fpzond,Zuverty,Ritual weapon improvement thing (im bad with title),"TLDR a the bottom 

Ritual weapons are in a strange position, if you think about it. They fill this strange role between Pinnacle weapons and legendary weapons, but are treated more like Pinnacle and less like legendaries, which i think is kinda wrong, since they are significantly less powerful than the first, but also one of the best options, compared to the second.

I guess what im trying to say, is that ritual weapons need to be closer to ""powerful legendaries"" , and that they should NOT be treated as ""weaker pinnacles"" by the game itself.

So, my suggestion is: make ritual weapons REgrindable. My idea is that ritual weapons should be...well, ritual. Once a week, or a month, (or some  other period of time that can fit into a season several times), you can grind for one (or several) ritual weapons to get a guaranteed boost to your Light level (to your weapons, at least). Or make them available to regrind all season, but only limited amount of times. 

Now, this solution might create some problems. For example, since ritual weapons drop fully masterworked, this can used to farm enh. cores, but i think it can be solved by limiting amount of times you can grind these weapons, like i stated above. Or maybe it doesnt have to be solved, since its not a problem, because cores are now much less valuable than they were before.

Timegating might also work. Like, first month you can only grind Vanguard weapons, next month only Crucible, etc. 

Some variation in barrel and mag perks might give this grind more reason to exist (similar to Redrix's Broadsword having random mag perk when you get it from Shaxx's engram, but having a fixed roll when you complete its quest) 

TL;DR: make tirual weapons regrindable, but give them a limit on how many times they can be grinded, and maybe give them some perk variation, like Redrix's Broadsword",11,1585325425,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpzond/ritual_weapon_improvement_thing_im_bad_with_title/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpykqs,movingtreeinc,Question about Trials and Tokens,"What's up friends? Long time lurker here, and I had a thought about Trials I wanted to throw at you guys and get some feedback on. (TL/DR at the bottom)

Would there be any long term drawbacks to Destiny if Bungie allowed players to keep their Trials tokens instead of deleting them every weekend?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been seeing a lot of discussion on Trials with last week's card resetting / token farming and how rough it was for teams trying to get their 3 wins just so they can at least spend their tokens, and it looks like a lot of players are getting demoralized completely out of Trials for it. I feel like if tokens stayed in your inventory, there would be less pressure for folks to grind tokens for their god roll shotgun, and more casual players would have some incentive to try again for their 3 wins next week.

I get that Trials is Endgame content for sure. From a PVE raider's perspective, you're definitely not going to get Anarchy if you don't down the last boss of Scourge, no matter how many hours you bang you head on it. But even if your group doesn't down any of the encounters in the raid, you can still walk away with a few prime engrams and the occasional exotic drop from trash mobs or hidden chests. Not the greatest loot sure, but it's never a complete bust is what I mean.

For me personally, I'm not terribly great at PVP (we're talking barely 1.12 K/D). I was super intimidated by PVP for a long time until I started the grind for Ace of Spades, and I'll be real with you guys, the valor rewards and pity tokens made sucking sting a lot less. I still had to earn Ace, that part wasn't a gimme. But the extra's helped keep me from getting so frustrated that I quit PVP altogether, and now I'm glad I stuck with it. Even now with Trials, I'm motivated to improve my teamwork and skills just to get in there and earn those 3 win and 5 win rewards, even if I never go Flawless

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR, Would there be a bad unintended consequence if players could keep their Trials tokens each week?",2,1585321943,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpykqs/question_about_trials_and_tokens/,DestinyTheGame,1
fpyjgy,LordTyronasuraus,EP Armour Update,"I feel this needs it’s own post, after seeing TWAB at 11pm yesterday and reading the whole thing I thought my eyes were deceiving me. I’m sure many are glad to see the older armour sets getting a seasonal mod slot, it makes them something good to chase.

But I thought I was going mad when I didn’t see       the Escalation Protocol armour on that list. I mean I and I hope others agree that it needs a seasonal mod slot, this season would be perfect to put some life into this armour set.

Cozmo said “Yes” when asked about whether Mod slots are being added retroactively. So there is Hope seemingly. It just feels strange to have a season built around Rasputin and not have EP armour updated to fit it. 

I went to Mars and ran EP wave after wave of 1-7 and then alternating 6/7 for all the armour just to find they didn’t have a seasonal mod slot. Seasonal mod slots these days are 50% of my decisions when keeping armour the other half is 25% the total stat number and 25% the Energy affinity. 

Eliminating 50% makes any of those sets an instant delete, which is a shame if you get high stars on an armour piece. On that note the EP armour drops with Lower stats than some blue items, the highest EP armour I had drop was 51, which is another instant dismantle. 

Now is the time to update the set, within this season. You say you are listening - now is another chance to prove it 


TLDR - Add Season of the Worthy slot to EP armour to make it good pls.

fpyhv6,SoySauce951,You can still play the way you want.,"I get it: you’re dissatisfied with this season and the lackluster PvE content drop. If you don’t like the content, new and pre-existing, then maybe Destiny isn’t for you at the moment. 
If you are a die-hard PvE player, go try a flawless raid, go do a speed-run, go play Gambit (just kidding, don’t do that). At this point, if you’re unhappy, get off reddit and play a different game. Two weeks after a content drop there are enough posts repeating the same thing that if you still aren’t happy, put it down. 

If you are a PvP player, but can’t stand the sweat level of Trials, then play comp on the weekends. It’s still rewarding, and you can avoid Hard Light more effectively.

But I know, you “love this game and want to see it succeed.” Yeah, and trashing it on reddit after the content creators have already shared their calmer and more cohesive two-cents is really going to get Bungie moving. If you can’t be satisfied with the pace they keep, then don’t play. 

Personally, I’ve been going for the Blacksmith title. Running forges has reminded me how enjoyable they really are. I’ve revisited the Niobe Labs puzzle, which was awesome, and I saw a new cutscene that has been in the game for over a year and was still new to me.

Now if your season is being ruined by beaver codes, or other glitches, than that’s another story. I can understand and empathize with having your experience ruined by something out of your control. And I’m sure the employees are doing their best to fix whatever it is from a remote location.

But bounties are not this mandated game function. If you don’t want to ever switch your load-out, and you want to stay in your comfortable little bubble at all times, then don’t pick up bounties!

I’ve had a great time this season just getting faster at raids, trying to get flawless runs, working on my horrible sniping. And in another month, I might get tired. And that’s okay. I don’t need to eat breathe sleep Destiny all the time. If you want to have a good time and know when to stop, then you can certainly have a good time.",15,1585321664,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpyhv6/you_can_still_play_the_way_you_want/,DestinyTheGame,0

---

This last weekend, I was looking at a few of my new Trials weapons and thinking, “Huh, I wonder if these have good rolls. Who do I trust to give me a weapon review with multiple points of view that could help me come to a decision?” 


After some time pondering, I remembered an awesome weapon review from Season of Dawn on the [Steelfeather Repeater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anp5VBGfhmI) Auto Rifle. The strengths and weaknesses of the weapon were explored, and multiple weapon rolls were presented. The review shared the perspective of a Controller user, but also from that of a keyboard and mouse pro. With a detailed overview of things to consider, I was able to come to my own conclusion on a desired roll.


I think it’s only right that this cool guy gets a bit of spotlight in our Community Focus series. Maybe you’ll find a few weapon reviews to help you understand perks, stats, and more! Enter: CoolGuy.


**So, CoolGuy, what makes you so cool aside from these weapon reviews? Who are you, what do you do for a living, and what inspired your callsign? **


&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** Hello everyone, I am CoolGuy. I am a Radiologic Technologist. I have worked in emergency rooms, operating rooms, clinics, and more. In 2014, I came across a game called Destiny, made by one of my favorite developers, and I liked it so much I made a YouTube video using my Xbox. The thought of making a video hadn’t crossed my mind until Destiny, so initially I was just making content as a hobby. Fast forward five years and add an awesome community who supported me and helped me see this as a possible future, and now [content creation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOitB3h99Ur9RzR5ftd2bA) is my day job.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08tfSZ30wX0&amp;amp;t=)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The CoolGuy moniker was given to me back in high school. I always got along well with everyone, regardless of their hobbies or backgrounds. I played videos games, varsity golf, pool, enjoyed all kinds of music and concerts, etc. One day somebody called me a “cool guy” and it stuck. I first got on Xbox Live in 2009; naturally, CoolGuy was taken. Hundreds of other variations of CoolGuy were also taken (MLGCoolGuy, SnipeMasterMLGCoolGuy, C00LGuy, XI CoolGuy IX, etc.). After a while, I decided to let everyone know that ""[I am CoolGuy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAOitB3h99Ur9RzR5ftd2bA)"" (the one and only).


**What brought you to start doing weapon breakdown videos specifically?**


&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** I ended up having a passion for it. I was fortunate enough to be included in the early days of Planet Destiny with Patrick Casey (Holtzmann). For me, his breakdowns really set the bar and, like many now look to me, I always looked to him to help me improve my game. Like we all do, I imitated the style of content I gravitated to as a player so, when I started creating my reviews, I based them loosely on how he broke down weapons.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiF8rf_3B3o)
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The goal with my channel is to put out unbiased information. I always share my opinions throughout, but the ultimate goal is to educate the player and help them understand what something is doing and how it works so they can then apply that knowledge to their game. From day one, it was incredibly important to me that my channel and the comments section provided a judgement-free zone. Your skill level doesn’t matter; we’re all improving daily, and when you better understand the mechanics of the game, it really opens up what’s possible for you however you like to play. At the end of the day, we all share the same passion for games and they’re a hell of a lot more fun when we’re doing well in them. 


**It's been awesome seeing you and your channel grow with each Season. Two weeks into Season of the Worthy, what’s your favorite loadout? **


&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** I’m a bit of a weapon wayfarer, meaning there aren’t too many I find myself solely attached to. I really do use them all—one of the perks of my job I guess – because I’m always hunting to review the new weapons and gear, I’m constantly playing the game in very different ways. If I had to choose, my favorite way to play is as a Hunter with Oathkeepers. Le Monarque and a rampage Duke is the combination. That unlimited bow draw guarantees you always get poison damage. Just hold the bow draw and, when you see an enemy, aim down sights and shoot. With how the total damage works out (poison included), if you land a headshot with the bow, all you need to do is land a shot with Duke. If you land a body shot with the Bow, you need a headshot with the Duke. After you clean them up, Duke will be at Rampage x1 doing 100 damage to the head, allowing you to two-shot your next opponent. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I can tell you no one suspects the Le Monarque/Duke – I take it all the way to Legend in comp.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;A close second favorite is probably anything Chromatic Fire on the Warlock... because explosions.  
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Season of the Worthy did bring me something I will forever be attached to, though. It’s what my friends call the “CoolGuy emote.” I love that it says “CoolGuy looks Cool.”

**Ah, good ol’ Duke. One of my coworkers loves it so much, it’s their call-sign. Of any weapon in Destiny or Destiny 2, which is your favorite?**


&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** My favorite weapon of all time is Ace of Spades. For all of us, there are certain aspects of the game that define what Destiny is for us and how playing it makes us feel. For me, Ace encompasses everything a Destiny Exotic weapon is. It sounds cool. It looks cool. When you land a headshot, you get that fast reload and a cool animation. The headshot final blow makes explosions and then you get to hold extra damage in the magazine after you get a kill. The whole shooting experience is just top notch. I feel like a gunslinger with Ace in my hands. 


**Cayde would be proud of every single word you just said. Brings a tear to our eyes! Where do you find yourself most active in Destiny right now? Favorite Crucible playlist?**


&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** I spend most of my time in the Crucible, the Mars Core Terminus lost sector, and the Tribute Hall. Okay, the last two aren’t by choice, they are just really good testing areas. I am glad Season of the Worthy has taken steps to really address PvP players. Trials of Osiris is something I can’t get enough of. I am already back to refreshing Twitter every second to see what the map is on Friday afternoon. Seeing a high-stakes 3v3 game mode like this come back gives me hope that this is only the beginning and a great foundation for future possibilities.

**Do you have a Last Word to share before signing off? Hah! Get it?! I made a weapon pun! You make weapon reviews! But seriously, any words of wisdom before you go?**


&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**CoolGuy:** I would like to share a true story with you. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Bungie builds worlds that bring people together. I am a testament to that. In 2009, I played my first ever online game, Halo 3. For three months, I never used a microphone to talk in PvP. The first day I did, after a match, the top person on the other team simply said, “Good game.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I told him the same and after that we partied up to play. This was my first ever interaction in online gaming. It turned out we had a lot in common. Later that night I told my wife “I think I met my best friend today.” She said “YEAH okay, gamer.”
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I continued to play different games with him and got to know his friends who lived close to him. I got to know his girlfriend. We talked every day. In 2014, my wife and I needed to move from New York. Long story short, five years later, we choose to move 15-minutes down the road from him and his girlfriend. Now it’s 2020. We meet for dinner, hang out, and even watch each other’s house when the other is on vacation. You know, things friends do. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For some of us, gaming is a hobby. For others, it’s a passion. Some of us game as a release from day-to-day activities. When you’re on Twitter, Reddit, or watching your favorite content creator or streamer; I want you to remember this. We are more the same than we are different, and you might just be playing with or against your new best friend. For me, the course of my life changed with a simple, “Good game.” Be kind to someone, you never know where it’ll lead.


**Thanks for stopping by. Don't be a stranger, and we'll be watching for your next review. Cheers!**

\#1 player: 20 kills, 22 deaths, 0 zones captured.

\#2 player: 19 kills, 10 deaths, 11 zones captured.

WHAT?!?!

No matter how you look at it, #2 player was WAAAAAY more important for his team than #1.

fpxm0y,SirisTheGreat,Y'all really need to stop being so rude to Bungie.,"Warning, this is SUPER ranty. As the title says, y'all are super rude to Bungie. And while there are the occasional post that is reasonable, most of what I see is: ""\*gamemode\* sucks!"" or ""this thing is annoying therefore it is the worst thing to ever exist"" or most commonly: ""eververse bad"". you know, even on the pvp subreddit, the subreddit dedicated to being competitive, is STILL better to look at than you guys, because they're at least reasonable in what they ask or recommend. On the topic of eververse though, bungie still has to make money now that the game is 1) free to play and 2) no longer part of activision, which cut out a major revenue stream and many other dev teams to help them. I get it, you want more cosmetics that you earn, but my god you all act as if bungie is stealing your money. I buy eververse items because I like the game and I like supporting the game I like. they aren't forcing me to buy anything, they didn't force me to buy the armor glows or any other item that's now rendered almost useless. you all act like a bunch of whiny children. Alos, every single suggestion that you guys have, with a couple exeptions, can be boiled down to: ""I like this hard to get item, but I want it easier."" and then when they listen and make item easier, all i hear is not ""thank you"" but ""item is easy to get, make it harder to get"". There's no pleasing you guys. Then, when a new season is announced, people do everything in one day, and complain there's nothing to do, and when things are timegated, to prevent said thing from happening, you also complain that you can't do it all in one go. you always want tons of new stuff, but you want it to never be like what you had before. there's only so much you can add without changing the core of the game.

I know there's more, but you've probably already downvoted me for calling you out, or have some ""um actually here's why bungie is worse than hitler and why you're bad for defending them"" rebuttal you're typing.

Make it easier to hit flying tripmines. Not to easy tho. This ""could"" make a higher skill ceiling. However if it get's to easy we could go back.

Arc
Make flux granades more viable, (Anny ideas?)

Way of the current: when hitting an enemy with Tempest Strike, depending on how manny you hit reload a portion of your magazine from reserves. (would make it easier to follow up with something after you use it)

Void
Make it so that you can change the diretion you are going when using shadow shot(like the straffe jump) (however don't make it so it is a nightmare in mhaham)


Warlock:

Solar
Give the ""well""'sword more health. I hate when it get's destroyed... 

Arc
Make the midd tre's mealey better

Void
""what ever you do DON'T make nova warp OP"" I still have nightmare' s from forsaken launch... (that and one eyed mask and Queenbreaker in Gambit) 


Titan. (warning. I don't play titan a lot, so I might not know how it is on your part) 

Solar. 
Sorry... I think that solar titan is in a good spot (lett me know if u don't think so) 

Arc
Pharhaps buffing flashbabang grande. (I never see people using it) 

Void
Again... Sorry I don't know what could work as a buff without making it broken, I mean... You have a SUPPRESSED GRANADE. 


FINAL NOTE:
I mostly play warlock and hunter. This is way I find it har to say something about titans. And remember this is a list of ""Small"" bufs mostly to add on the skill sealing.

fpwjku,-TwoSixNine-,The current state of 600RPM auto rifles in the consle Crucible,"So I've just gotten back from a few months' break from Destiny and I gotta say this new meta makes no sense. 600RPM autos are too strong on console and either they need to be nerfed, or other primaries need to be buffed. This post is a bit long but I'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute or two to read it and leave some feedback.  

The main problem with Hard Light and 600RPM autos, in general, is that they now have faster base TTKs than any archetype of hand cannon while being the easiest weapons to use. A 0.7 second base TTK on a 600RPM auto and 0.8 second base TTK on a 150RPM hand cannon... what? On console, where it's already hard enough to hit 3 headshots in a row because of bloom, flinch, and a less accurate input method, there is essentially zero reason to use anything but an AR right now unless (like me) you have a strong preference for the hand cannon playstyle. If you're not forcing yourself to peekshoot with Spare Rations in every single engagement, you'd be better off with a Hard Light, and even if you *do* try to abuse peekshooting, chances are you'll get prefired down because these things apparently have 50 round magazines.  

What's even the point of hand cannons anymore? They're supposed to reward precision with the fastest TTKs the game has to offer. Like I said, on console, I don't usually hit a 3-crit anyways and I'm a top 0.5% player... now I can put two headshots into someone and get killed before I can even get a third shot off because the most forgiving weapons in the game outright beat my Thorn. Before the update, my rumble win ratio was close to 90%. Now I'm only winning about 65% of my games. I get stomped by bots because any 600RPM AR can easily outgun any hand cannon at literally any range with the slightest amount of gun skill. ARs are destroying what little skill gap we have left and I see people here embracing it because ""Spare Rations takes no skill,"" or ""hand cannons have been meta for so long, it's time for another primary meta."" Like come on man, SR has only marginally higher aim assist than other weapons in this game and if you miss even one headshot your TTK goes up to 1.2 seconds (God forbid you miss entirely). I don't use Spare Rations but if you think it takes no skill you're flat out wrong.

Hand cannons were *rightfully* the best. People get stomped by good players using hand cannons and aren't good enough to counter them or pick one up themselves, but they refuse to admit it. Instead, they complain that it takes no skill to make themselves feel better about losing. Thanks to this attitude, we have recoilless, 50 round magazine, no-skill-required, low-risk, high-reward bullet hoses dominating the console crucible. Now that 600RPMs are broken, all of those guys can *finally* counter HC players like me regularly and have subsequently been running me down in rumble, because *now* it takes no effort! Simply equip Hard Light/The Summoner/Suros Regime and profit. My Thorn has wet dreams about being able to kill someone as fast as these things can.  

Unfortunately, most people only like the meta when it's good for *them,* not the game as a whole. People who love this new meta probably weren't doing too well in the last one, and 600RPM ARs like Hard Light have given them an excuse to say ""See? It wasn't my fault I was losing! It was the game's!"" And before you say ""Hey, aren't you complaining right now because this meta isn't good for you? Isn't that hypocritical?""  

**No**. This meta makes no sense for the (console) crucible as a whole. The premise of my argument is that a weapon's dominance should be decided by its difficulty to use. The harder a weapon is to use, the faster its TTK should be for those who can use it well. If hand cannons aren't at the top, then Bungie needs to make them easier to use or make the offending class more difficult to use in compensation. It's not a matter of opinion. It's basic balancing and game design. So long as hand cannons are the hardest to use, you would be *wrong* to say they shouldn't be the best.  

Fact of the matter is, though, that unless they get a major adjustment, hand cannons will *always* be the most skillful weapons to use on console and thus should *always* be the most rewarding. Higher skill players will *always* prefer hand cannons and lower skill players will *always* complain that they're overpowered. In any case, ARs take less skill on console no matter how you look at it, so I guess enjoy the meta while it's fresh, 'cause getting Hard Light rounds rammed down your throat at 600RPM by people less skilled than you is gonna get real old, real fast.",1,1585314126,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpwjku/the_current_state_of_600rpm_auto_rifles_in_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

The issue I've found is that the 'new' gear they have added this season weather that be trials armor or the old factions gear is completely useless i have absolutely no incentive to ever equip it because some of these items are 15 to 25 points lower than my current raid gear in terms of stats (m/res/rec/ect.). so other than to look cool why should i ever equip this gear or take notice of it? it sort of seems like a waste of resources re-implementing the armor drops. this bugs me because i'd love nothing more than to make my warlock look like Anubis but whats the point if my stats suffer? Can't we just have the option to use these as ornaments once we have gotten them once? I have been flawless both weeks in trials now and when i have gotten the gear the first thing i check is the stats to see if it's worth my time and unfortunately 58 and 59 is just useless at this point. it was my understanding that this gear was supposed to be as good as the stuff that drops in raids but so far it seems to be about as good as above average world drops. not sure what ways bungie could rectify this without raid content becoming pointless but its an issue i'm having with the game at the moment.",12,1585311740,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpw082/the_issue_with_armor_20_currently/,DestinyTheGame,1

I'm hopping back into the game after a long pause: some context..

I've been with the game from day one in 2014 on Xbox One. Long story short I sold my Xbox last year, and since then have bought a PS4 (mainly to play Spider-Man, no regrets). I left the game after the Forsaken campaign, and in my seclusion bought an up-to-date version of the game on PS4 last night, and transferred across my characters (a feature I wasn’t expecting, really cool!). I’m about 750, and having logged in last night, I found a lot of things which confounded me, the tower seems to have expanded, the drifter moved, the moon available, trials, raids etc. 

I remember this reddit as a close-knit community, and was wondering if anyone could advise me where to begin with all this new stuff, so that I can catch up with everyone else!

I'm speculating that next season we will get a raid, it would only make sense.

fpupdx,TerraParagon,Im sick and tired of spawn killing the AI. Its not fun. The reason why the game feels so unrewarding is because PvE activities are too easy.,"Most if not all PvE activities can be completed with your brain turned off. Im sick and damn tired of spawn-killing the AI over and over again in PvE. This is contrast to Destiny 1 where alot of enemies could OHK your ass if you werent careful. Some of the newer players are now accustomed to the easy nature of the game so a jump back to D1Y1 difficulty will be a stretch too far. And many of D1Y1’s systems were pretty fucked (Bosses were way too spongey)

But you cant deny that those nightfalls with arc burn against Fallen werent fun as hell. They could one shot your ass sure, but you could one shot them back. The difficult (and sometimes brutal) nature of D1 **kept people experimenting** though. There are some new activities like higher difficulty nightfalls that throw in some of the classic difficulty but the thing is, you never have to touch the higher difficulty content in order to get max light. When the game is actually a challenge to players, exotics like Leviathans Breath or Merciless really get to shine at what theyre good at, but when guardians are the mindless god-killing machines that we are *all of the time,* theres not much reason to use things outside of Izanagis Burden. 

When every activity can be completed with your mind turned off, all weapons, no matter what perks they have, feel samey because they ARE the same. No one cares how much damage a Point of the Stag bow does vs a Subtle Calamity if they both one shot legionaries the **exact same way**. Challenging content makes *every* gun in the D2 sandbox unique because their becomes a reason to fully explore every weapons uniqueness.",12,1585305277,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpupdx/im_sick_and_tired_of_spawn_killing_the_ai_its_not/,DestinyTheGame,1

fptrs2,PyjamaLlamaParty,"Bungie, this game now just feels like a mobile game. A bounty simulator with minimum content but regular updates (Seasons) to keep a treadmill going to collect materials","And it just doesn’t feel great to play. It’s a simulated loop where you’re pulling a slot machine while doing chores for bits (literally) and pieces to level something up 

It’s not that the game feels bad. It just doesn’t feel rewarding or satisfying like a looter shooter should anymore because the focus seems to be on making us play rather than keeping us playing

Bounties need to stop being the point of the game and more love needs to be given to the glorious world we play in. Eververse needs to stop being the source of the cool and quirky cosmetics and let us have some for mastering content or feats not easily done. Add some more rng back into the game, sure it can feel bad but it was more satisfying than some of these quests that do nothing but make us re-run year or 2 year old content 

Trials doesn’t seem like it got full love and attention, just a nostalgia trip and a GOTCHU because it’s roping people in to play which will fall rapidly if the farming issue isn’t addressed and if it’s an extreme change, do it soon, not next season 

All this comes from a good place but if you start at Forsaken the downward slide is concerning and making people switch off, not rush back to the game

fptr1d,underpaidgamedev,The Steam Update late last night should have fixed an issue that was causing the mass amount of beaver &amp; anteater disconnects recently.,"For those who don't know, with this season Bungie changed how the game's networking works on PC by utilizing a feature Valve provides to developers called the Steam Relay which is a part of the Steam Networking Sockets Steamworks feature - Steam Relays are a series of servers that you are connected to that then relay your networking data to the game's server. The main advantage of this system are:

* there's a lot of relay servers and not everyone is connected to the same one

* players aren't connected to a game server directly so they don't know its IP for DDoS

* player IPs are likewise masked so people can't DDoS you in P2P games.

* if a relay server is DDoS'd or goes offline Steam will automatically move you on to another relay seamlessly

* these servers are placed in really great locations and Valve has done a lot of stuff to basically make this system provide lower latency than normal routing for most people.

So basically, less ping on average &amp; it becomes relatively impossible to DDoS other players and servers.

There was a problem where in P2P connected games like Destiny 2, the 4th bullet point was not working. If a relay server would go offline than anyone connected to it in Destiny 2 would be disconnected from the game, whereas it's supposed to move the players into another relay server and maintain the P2P connection.

As of the Steam update last night, this is fixed:

&gt; Steam Networking Sockets

&gt; Fixed a bug that could cause a P2P connection to drop if a relay went offline while in use

This should, in theory if the fix works, massively reduce (if not eliminate) the amount of Anteater &amp; Beaver error codes that people have been experiencing since this season started.",12,1585299901,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fptr1d/the_steam_update_late_last_night_should_have/,DestinyTheGame,1

fptf2a,_Malin0,"So Bungie said now that they are split from Activision, that they are ""In charge of our own Destiny"". Looking at the state of the game right now, is this really what they wanted their game to be?","So there was a post a bit ago about how someone is sad that they miss Activision being a part of this game's development, which is, sadly, the same for me.  


I feel like Shadowkeep was the first true ""Bungie"" developed DLC, as well as the latest 3 seasons. Which is painfully obvious, and if you compare Season of the Drifter/Forge/Opulence to Season of the Undying/Dawn/Worthy, it is incomparable. Sure, there have been some good changes, but if you look at the pure amount of *content* we are getting for our money, it's embarrassing.  


It seems that Bungie has went down the rabbit hole of wanting more money rather than supporting their community and giving players what they want. It feels like they are taking advantage of their playerbase by the *insanely* overpriced Eververse store, especially since Eververse is getting way more focus than anything else in this game. I hate to see this game go this direction, but it's *really* hard to speak good about this game when we are *constantly* getting let down, season after season.  
\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is the overview I came up with, which took me about an hour-ish. Like I said, I probably missed some stuff, but point it out and I will edit the post. I didn't want to try and figure out the amount of triumphs added/removed, strikes added, events, etc.

Looking at everything in Year 3, you can tell pretty clearly that the game *did* become F2P, mostly with the season pass tiers, and all of the Eververse changes, to make more money. Which is understandable, to a certain point. Once they got to the point where Eververse was getting more attention and polish than their *paid* seasonal content, it was obvious to me that they didn't give two shits what their playerbase wanted, they just want to make money off of it, which is sad. Also, all of the content has become way more time consuming/time wasting, to keep you in the game longer.

The upcoming September update needs to be massive. It needs to make up for the lackluster 3 seasons we have gotten so far (Undying, Dawn, Worthy), as I am not sure what Season 11 has in store. However, I doubt we will see any *good* changes until then.

Overall, the state of the game is pretty bad, and has been for awhile now. More focus on Eververse than anything else, catering to casual players, underwhelming Trials rewards, dull/repetitive seasonal content, which is going to previous locations and doing bounties, basically. Datto made some good points in his First Impressions with this season, and it sucks to see so many Destiny veterans, so overwhelmingly disappointed with how the game is being handled. I've heard some of the biggest streamers in D2 atm say that they are used to being let down when it comes to this game.

fpt8wm,RealSirAwoken,Opinion: PvP Light-Enabled Activities Cripple non-PvE Players like Myself,"The only reason I’ve played destiny for the last year is for the crucible. My gun skill is amazing. I have all the pinnacle PvP weapons. I love earning them and fighting for them. I can use any archetype or weaponry and still destroy people depending on the meta. I can use any character or subclass extremely well. I’m great at the game. 

However, if I want to play Trials of Iron Banner, I have to level up my light by mainly leaving the Crucible to play activities that are a part of the Crucible. I can’t play Crucible and level up like everyone else, obviously. Therefore, I’m forced to leave what I’d rather play to play parts of the game that I don’t enjoy. 

A possible argument could be that I don’t need Trials or Iron Banner in order to still enjoy the crucible. 
That is true. However, locking off other activities because I don’t play the rest of the game regularly doesn’t award me as a Crucible player. Crucible players are not rewarded for doing such and lose the opportunity to play Trials or Iron Banner. These activities are completely PvP related aside from the loot involved. 

Another possible argument could be that only playing PvP is a punishment for myself since the rest of the game must be enjoyable. 
This can be true. 
For myself, I’ve played every other portion of Destiny from the inside out since the beta back in 2014. In destiny 2, I quit when Warmind released. Forsaken came out and I rejoined the game for the PvP aspect. Luna’s Howl and Not Forgotten were weapons I arrived for and earned. That was my favorite time in destiny pvp since trials of Osiris in destiny 1. 

Another argument could be that since trials of Osiris in destiny 1 was light enabled that it’s only fair for it to carry over to destiny 2. 
When house of wolves was released, leveling up light was simpler. House of wolves also made it very easy to level up light. Destiny 2’s light system is spread out and super Grindy. You have to play the same activities over and over to level up. That’s not new for this game. 

The last argument I’ll bring up that I find to be ludicrous is the one that says: “Light enabled barely makes a difference in gameplay.” 
It makes a difference. It can make an even bigger difference depending on your light. The lower you are, the more damage you take the less you give. That’s a huge difference. 

This seems like a lot of whining and complaining, but I wonder if any destiny players agree with me out there. Does it help trials of Osiris to be light enabled? Does it not help trials of Osiris to be light enabled? Tell me your thoughts. 

For myself, it limits the player base in terms of who will participate in trials of Osiris and who will not. That’s without regard to players who simply won’t play it even while being max light. I’m sure there’s many who will say: “You could just level up your light and stop complaining,” but that will never change my opinion about the matter. I’m leveling up my light either way. 

Let’s see how this goes (finger’s crossed).",22,1585296965,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpt8wm/opinion_pvp_lightenabled_activities_cripple/,DestinyTheGame,1
fpt7br,ACD421,Should Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten be restored to original form?,In my opinion yes given the current state of auto rifles and last word aim assist. There aren't loads of counters to either last word or a spun up suros. Bringing these back to the originality of when we earned them and grinded them out I think would be very fair. They were meta before the nerf plus many sandboxes later where we are in AR meta with LW aim assist lords. It wouldn't really change the tilt but at least we get to use a weapon that is godly from are hard work and very possible at countering considering it was a 180 3 tap if you made your shots.

fpshgl,aaabbbx,Lets talk ornaments - or the lack of them.,"Hi B.

You know the great idea you had at some point for Iron Banner (for example) to drop ornaments instead of armor pieces. 

Or how you later on allowed several items to be equipped as cosmetics (and thus allowing us to delete the items we've been keeping in our armory).

Well.

We need you to do more of it - i.e. to finish what you started.

&amp;#x200B;

For example IRON BANNER:

Iron Rememberance Plate (ITEM) lets me equip the ornaments: 

* Silimars Iron Plate
* Iron Pledge Ornament

Iron Truage Plate (ITEM) lets me equip the ornaments:

* Silimars Iron Plate
* Iron Pledge Ornament

Iron Symanchy Plate (ITEM) lets me equip no ornaments:

&amp;#x200B;

If you put 2 and 2 together, you will notice that I have 3 IRON BANNER Plate Items that I can not equip as an ornament on any of the other pieces, meaning I ""Need"" to keep all 3 items around. 

&amp;#x200B;

In these times of hardship, please do not make it even harder on us by forcing us to play ""inventory micro management simulator 2020™"" and instead make every armor piece we obtain eligible as an ornament on any other item in that slot, so I can finally get below 490 items in my vault.

fpsgpy,JLoco11PSN,Can solo players please have a toggle option to decide if we join matches in progress,"Because it's infuriating being thrown match after match after match into rooms already in progress when you want to find a lobby.

Just look at this bullshit of how many games I am thrown into already in progress, while already having to suffer using bullshit guns

[https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/psn/JLoco11/matches](https://destinytracker.com/destiny-2/profile/psn/JLoco11/matches)

Depending on when this is viewed, 7 of the last 8 games are games in progress and not lobbies.  And no matter how fast you are, the game barely gives you time to react to back out before the game sends in.

There should be an option to decline this, or not be thrown into a room in progress at all that players can turn on and off.  Because after all, if I just need to grind out 4 rotator games or normal games....... I'm all for getting that shit over as fast as possible.  I'll take a fast asswhooping and collect my rewards.

But if I want to work on bounties, or these stupid fucking steps to get a bow, particularly super kills (when you give us 0 super energy joining a game), it's beyond frustrating.  I don't even join, I just change character as I fly into a 33-6 match (because I know what team I am heading to).",4,1585292574,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpsgpy/can_solo_players_please_have_a_toggle_option_to/,DestinyTheGame,1

fps7ve,MeteorValor,"Fine keep hand cannons weak for no good reason, but at LEAST fix 180's!","I have a god roll Trust with Rampage and Dragonfly that before the rampage rework and handcannon nerf would have no problem tearing through PvE. Sure until it was at 3x Rampage it wasn't all that powerful but that was fine. I still in the span of season 7 thanks to menagerie got over 2,000 kills.  
  
Now though? This this is HORRIBLE! 9 rounds in the magazine and it takes 4 shots just to kill ONE enemy! WHAT!?! So that means the maximum I can kill is two enemies not counting any possible kills with dragonfly, which is rare now a days is if I'm lucky enough to not have the kill stolen by a fireteam member because he can kill the enemy in one or two shots with literally the worst rolled hand cannon.  
  
But what about rampage? Wouldn't that solve everything? Yeah you'd think but guess what? Guess what the whopping big number of headshots I need to kill a red bar enemy in ANY activity above a strike? 3. Rampage helped by ONE bullet! And this isn't limited to just this one hand cannon, every single 180 hand cannon I've tried all are TERRIBLE!  
  
I honestly feel sorry for the console players now because if this is the hand cannons they're using no wonder nobody uses them. They're trash garbage now. Honestly rampage should be treated the same on 180's as Huckleberry treats it. It still took two shots to get a red bar kill even with 3x rampage.",43,1585291227,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fps7ve/fine_keep_hand_cannons_weak_for_no_good_reason/,DestinyTheGame,1

fps0ob,Echo1608,Handheld supernova needs to be toned back on the nerfs.,"So, I've been playing around with the handheld supernova since the nerfs. And I really think Bungie went to far. 

Now first thing's first, The charge time is fine, just took some getting used to. The hold time was also fine, just took some getting used to, I just have to calculate how fast I'm moving towards my target.  

BUT....The self damage is just......Oh dear lord why does it do so much damage. If you throw a grenade at your feet does it insta kill you? No. If a titan shoulder charges someone into a wall, does it kill them too. No. If a hunter throws their knife into a wall and it bounces and hits them in the head does it kill them? No.

So why on earth does Handheld supernova do so much self damage? 

I have a theory that it may be a bug, since it is a close range attack it would make sense to not have the user kill themselves. So maybe instead of dealing the self damage based on the attack itself, like a grenade. The game is instead dealing self damage based on each individual bolt. 

I am curious to see other players thoughts and feelings on this nerf. I understand where it was coming from. But this is way to far. I'm getting tired of killing myself when a squad of thralls runs at me a little to fast.

fpru6k,Shadow_s_Bane,"Remove farmable ( repeatable ) bounties from Trials, please.","Bounties is the issues, I get more tokens from bounties than from winning, idea of repeatable bounties in trials is busted.

Trials ahould have been Weekly and Daily only, with wins awarding more tokens.   


1st win awarding 3 tokens, 2nd 4 tokens, 3rd 5 tokens, 7 tokens for 4th win, 9 tokens for 5th, 12 for 6th and 15 for 7th win and 20 from flawless chest.

This way you are actually incentivising winning and not farming, 65 tokens for flawless, 45 for 7wins, 28 for 5 wins and 19 for 3 wins, that's fair and not farmable. Plus if you want decent amount of tokens you have to win.  


3 **additional** rewards for flawless, 2 for 7 wins, 1 for 5 wins and almost 1 **additional** reward for 3 wins.  


i know this will make getting decent rolls much harder, but there is a better way to combat stupidly annoying RNG.

1. Vendor Rolls for Saint 14, for that week's rewards, costting arround 40-50 tokens.
2. Restrict the loot pool from vendor engram to that weeks rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

Hush resets the timer on head shot kills. Increased target acquisition to be close to or match the current TLW.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakneck either increases reload and handling with Rampage stacks or gets Ambitious Assassin.

&amp;#x200B;

21% Delirium is actually fine where it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Wendigo gets a larger mag and can stack more orbs. Seeing Spike Grenades would probably be overkill, but I'd still like to see those numbers anyway jusg to see how high that dps would be.

&amp;#x200B;

Oxygen gets a new, stronger version of Dragonfly and Meganeura stacks 2-3 more times. The new version of Dragonfly would increase the damage of the next Dragonfly explosion depending on the # of enemies killed by the previous explosion. Stacks 3-4 times, 10-15% more damage each stack. Buffed explosion kills do not scale with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Loaded Question causes explosions for every kill instead of just kills with the first shot.

&amp;#x200B;

Redrix gets it's PVE nerf reverted. Gets better sights and handling OR the new Redrix is a 540 pulse with Desperado increasing damage to match a 340, basically just switching a few numbers around. Probably OP in that case, but limited by range and other problems more noticeable on rapid fire frames.

&amp;#x200B;

Recluse gets back it's crit multiplier. MoA body shot damage increased to 27% or 41.5%. Putting the buff in the middle between Rampage 2-3 or Multikill Clip 2-3.

&amp;#x200B;

Revoker gets 1 or 2 more shots in the mag. Multikills have a chance to return 1 shot to the mag from reserves (20-30% tops).

&amp;#x200B;

Mountaintop is fine how it is, thing is a monster in the right hands (as few as they may be on console). The best it can get without breaking it is faster reload on kills with direct hits.

&amp;#x200B;

Luna/ NF get a reworked MH. Stacks twice before resetting the same way. Each stack increases range by 50% of the total and damage by 6.6-7.2% per stack, resulting in a total increase of 9-10. Double the damage increase in PVE, 13.2-14.4% per stack.

68+72.488+76.976. Since the game likes to round decimals up, that is 68+73+77.

Or for the higher buff, 68+72.896+77.792, or 68+73+78 as the game would register. 

This is more of a PVE buff than PVP as it won't kill any faster there, and it will still kill in 2 head 1 body. In regards to it's PVE performance, I can guarantee we all have better handcannons in PVE anyway either for overall damage or for crowd control. Perfect legendary examples that will still outperform it in PVE include the following:

* Kindled Orchid
* Spare Rations
* Seraph HC
* Trust
* Waking Vigilance
* Duke MK.44
* Warden's Law (if they ever fix the damn thing)
* Service Revolver

Exotics include:

* Sturm/ Drang for up to... I can't remember how high it can stack
* Sunshot (clear an entire room quickly)
* Thorn (especially with the buff)
* Ace (for 6 shots at least, but the improved Dragonfly and Funeral Pyre do make up for that, especially with Chromatic Fire)
* Erianna's Vow (keep hitting the head)
* Malfeasance (especially depending on the catalyst if they've changed it to something better and friends using it)
* The Last Word (after the catalyst drops, I'm expecting a 20-35% increase to crit damage resulting in hip fire crits hitting for 82-93 in PVP)

fpql23,NaxxD,Does Golden Gun (Top/bottom Tree) feel Super to you? [PvE],"*Gonna be a long one *

I’m probably going to get hit with a lot of flak here but I feel a certain way about Golden Gun in PvE related content. In PvP I’m aware the two trees excel but that feeling definitely doesn’t carry over into other areas of the game the same way that other Supers seem to. I’m not here to propose ways to break the game or remove the identity of GG but as the title suggests, I’m here to have a discussion. 

I feel as though the Super abilities that we have as guardians is a power fantasy that makes you feel unstoppable and deadly but ever since I’ve played GG in D2 I’ve never really felt that. I enjoy playing GG and I want the super to feel something that i don’t feel is a waste of usage every time I contemplate using it. Nothing is worse than watching your super energy deplete on 6 shot while having to maximize it’s usage on trash mobs, making it less useful than equipping sunshot. It deals negligible damage to bosses if you’re not running bottom tree, a short window of usage (for PvP balancing I’m sure) and a feeling of uncontrolled, rushed usage once activated. GG as a whole feels to funnel into a play style and have the super as a side piece that adds little to round up the feeling of a power fantasy, rather than encourage a play style and throw in some exciting sauce on top. Which is why it’s so conflicting;  the play style feels great but the super doesn’t fulfill it.

I understand PvE and PvP content run completely differently and changes to one can drastically affect the other, GG holds its own in PvP but falls off so badly in PvE. 
The way of a thousands cuts tree was an extreme refresher to making the solar tree feel powerful across both gameplay elements, while remaining balanced. It feels GOOD to use and I’m not second guessing when I should use it like I do with Golden gun (PvE-wise), if I mess up, it’s on me. 

The problems I have with GG top tree’s Super activation is it feels weak af. It’s rare for me the event where I use it well and feel satisfied,  this definitely wasn’t the case in D1 where you had only 3 shots to use, it still felt effective. D1 vets know multiple aspects of the super are gone, the more favorable ones being Keyhole &amp; Combustion. There’s rarely any satisfaction using the super because it just doesn’t do a lot, even with the changes to adding refunds on GG one hit kills. It feels like a glorified sidearm and I obviously don’t speak for everyone with my opinions on this, I don’t want to be ignorant to that but I’m wondering if any of this resonates with you in PvE content. 

Using GG for clearing multitude of trash mobs, doesn’t feel Super, every super does that. Using all 6 shots on a single strong target that isn’t a boss while doing next to no damage, does not feel Super. Using Celestial on anything but a boss doesn’t feel Super and the explosion aspect, more often than not, adds very little value to it. I could go on. The only recognizable value the super grants is orbs for my fireteam so they can use their supers to make all the difference.
If top Tree GG is for clearing low-mid level mobs then make it excel in doing so and have it feel good to do so.

Bottom Tree GG does have its uses and has a clearer Avenue as to what it should be used for, high DPS against stronger targets. The only problem is you find yourself holding onto your super until you reach the boss room, am I wrong, furthermore, with the addition of Line ‘em up and it’s damage increase after 20 seconds you tend to hold onto it to try and maximize it’s potential a lot of the time.

With both trees it seems the underlying issue is you can’t let loose and that is what a Super should be. Maybe I’m speaking well out of place and no one feels like this at all in PvE. Maybe it’s a lack of skill on my end but compare this to the devour tree on warlock and you have yourself a completely different story. The perks are amazing, and the super is kickass! It feels like an exotic tree in comparison to GG’s. It even upholds in PvP, while not as effective sure, it still upholds a respectable level of value. 
As GG users do we even have exotic armor pieces that feed into the Super’s effectiveness or class play style aside from celestial nighthawk? It’s a bit crazy when I’m playing with my mate and he one shots a Champion with a single shoulder charge cus of peregrines, all while having a super great for clearing out all types of ads, whereas I can’t do near as much with my super alone.

I would present some changes and will feel free to do so but this is long enough as it is? I would like to know what u think if you’ve gotten this far...",11,1585283071,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpql23/does_golden_gun_topbottom_tree_feel_super_to_you/,DestinyTheGame,1

&amp;#x200B;

I love the concept of champions in game. They're a mini boss with a slight mechanic that forces people to actually pay attention to what they are using in order to move forward. But having to run double primaries because 8/10 times no one else on my fire-team of randoms has the right mods equipped is mindbogglingly annoying. That or having to switch mid fight because of said scenario.

fppgts,rontourage,"Completing the 100 Seasonal Ranks could unlock an ""armor key"" which, when applied, would allow seasonal mods from that season to be applied to any armor piece.","What the title says.

Use the ""seasonal armor key"" slot to unlock a sub-category mod slot that shows the mods from that season. Keys can be swapped on armor at any time (e.g. Forsaken Key, Dawn Key, Worthy Key, etc), and then players can equip mods from that season. This would prevent the UI from getting too unruly, while allowing people to use the enormous catalog of mods on the armor that they want. 

The current system simply does not allow players to take advantage of our backlog of mods when faced with a challenge where they would be appropriate. Wanting to attempt a challenging encounter (e.g. Master/Grandmaster Nightfall, etc) should not come with the burden of having to grind armor from a past season in order to properly equip ourselves for the challenge.",3,1585278198,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fppgts/completing_the_100_seasonal_ranks_could_unlock_an/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpp1ni,ArynRo,This Week At Bungie,"Insert comment about some boring thing that happened last week.

Check-in with Bungie Help/Sandbox/Crucible/Gambit Team to talk about something largely irrelevant.

Upcoming Hotfix or patch notes:

* Fixed an issue where players were having fun.

* Details on pending nerfs. 

* Reassurance that anything not addressed in the pending nerf section WILL be hit in subsequent seasons.

* Insert reference to latest Director's Cut, reiterating that game design (or ""work"" as the player base calls it) is hard. Blame players for growing too powerful. Don't mention that power creep truly only applies to &lt;100 PC streamers, and ruined zero fun for anyone with a normal job/class load/life/console.

*Obligatory reminder that seasons make life so much easier for the dev team so the rest of us should all be grateful for them too - like this franchise has been free to play since launch.

fArt Section -

Every author's favorite section. Post a tweet, and/or 2-3 vids the community made. Pick whatever is already trending, but make it seem like you scoured the web for it and found a hidden gem.

$$$ Ask - 

Be sneaky with how you present this one. Sometimes its Eververse tweaks, sometimes its corporate partnerships, sometimes its a donation or fund for a good cause/ world crisis. If it is a fundraising effort, you CAN tell the players we will give 1 less lashing to whichever poor sap designed this month's fundraising emblem.

Conclusion - 

Squeeze in one more dad joke, make a reference to whatever rotating bullshit is up next week and how poor/great you are at it. That's an easy laugh. Tease next season of same shit players have already done for half a decade.

fpovut,wearhere,Can we have more anti-barrier mods?,"In the Season of the Worthy, there are all sorts of mods to overload and stagger champions:

* for overload champions, mods let you use auto rifles, submachine guns, sidearms, hand cannons, swords, arc grenades, or warmind cells
* for unstoppable champions, mods let you use hand cannons, solar melee abilities, or warmind cells

But for anti-barrier champions, this season's artifact gives us two options: submachine guns and sidearms.

IMO, these are very unforgiving weapon choices. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr8_JYRBaYQ shows that it takes almost an entire SMG mag to pierce a barrier; and I don't really want to get within sidearm range of a barrier champion, especially if that's a barrier *Servitor* with a bunch of immune ads around it.

This leaves Eriana's Vow, which is a good choice, but with a bunch of limitations (is an Exotic, uses special ammo, is a hand cannon so if I'm also fighting unstoppables I don't feel like running a hand cannon for that too). And if you're with a fireteam (e.g. running Divinity + Izanagi's), you may be able to defeat the champion before it even raises its barrier, but I'm not sure that's possible to do solo (sound off in the comments if you have a way).

But the weapon choices here are beside the point. If you don't want to run an unstoppable/overload weapon, *you don't have to*, because there are melee and/or warmind cell mods for that.

**TL:DW**

So how did your guys' 2nd weekend of trials go? Good? I know every person in the comments went flawless right? Heh. NOT ME.

Just a big ol discussion post about this weekend incoming

Here’s some things I noticed

1. Anomaly
   1. I can’t be the only one that just cant stand it right? Like, maybe its because I didnt play D1 and this is the first time I’m actually playing it? I dunno. 
2. Power didn't really seem to be much of a problem, I was 995 so for the most part people only had 5-10 power on me or my teammates Pretty much all day I’d have to say the average LL was  like 990/1000.
3. Hardlight. Hardlight. Hardlight
   1. Like duh, autos just got a buff of course you noticed it a lot
   2. I dont even think the autos buff was bad, Just tone down the ricochet damage on hard light and MAYBE the clip size? This seems to be the general consensus 

Like maybe 75% of the current ricochet damage and a 40 round mag? maybe?

1. Shotgun farmers
   1. I’m never going to be that guy to hate on another content creator but cammycakes, cmon breh
   2. I know hes just pointing out the most efficient way of farming something
   3. I know bungie probably should have thought about this further cause on Monday I had a HELLUVA time hitting 3 wins
2. card/connection based matchmaking needs a tweak
   1. Is trials supposed to be hard, yes. As it should be. But to be matched up against multiple flawless players in your first match on your card… like come the fuck on.
   2. There should probably be some check/team rating when you queue into a fresh card.

Anyone that frequents/subscribes to this sub understands what’s going on with content. We all get it. 

Yet, every. Single. Day. I see more and more complaints about the same things. I can’t be the only one that is sick of it. 

Can we just all agree to take a break from complaining (or at least make an effort to keep the complaints organized) and simply appreciate that we not only have a game that we can all enjoy playing, but a dev team that is clearly keeping the game operating in a crisis. 

COVID-19 is a very serious threat to the world we live in and the people we love. Thousands, whether tens or hundreds, are likely to DIE. People we know and love will be wiped from the face of the planet due to a virus that didn’t even exist 6 months ago. A virus that surprised the world and has thrown it into chaos. 

In this time of crisis we need to be by each others side. Not bashing the people that are potentially sacrificing their own safety to keep us occupied. 

Dev team. I love you. We love you. Keep safe. Even though it appears we don’t, we absolutely do appreciate your efforts!

Fellow redditors. I’m really sorry if you find this upsetting. I’m sorry if all you care about are the issues in this game. I just want us to see the bigger picture and be a bit more understanding in this dark time. 

But for the love of all that is good in this life. Can we just STOP for a day, a week, a month?!

I’m a 31 year old asthmatic and I’m shit scared of dying. This virus could very likely kill me if I contract it.

fpo1oz,FuckingTyndallEffect,World Drop Seasonal Armor Slots,"In the most recent March 26th TWAB, Bungie details their plans to add seasonal slots to world drop armor pieces.

Great! Late, but still much appreciated.

But then the TWAB goes on to say which armor pieces are getting which seasonal mod slot. If you don’t understand that, basically different armor sets within the world drop loot table will have different seasonal mod slots. The faction armor sets will have Season of the Worthy mod slots, while other sets will have Season of the Dawn/Undying mod slots.

My contention with this is the following; why do this in the first place? Why give armor sets old seasonal mod slots? Why not just give them all Worthy mod slots? Why elevate certain armor sets (as the armor with Season of the Worthy slots will be useful for much longer than the ones with undying mod slots) over other sets if they’re all in the same loot pool?

The easiest solution to this problem would be to give all world drop armor the same seasonal mod slot from the get go, and update them seasonally. 

I know this fix won’t be high on Bungie’s to do list, but at this point I feel like they’re fucking this up on purpose.",5,1585272504,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpo1oz/world_drop_seasonal_armor_slots/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpnxnj,SparkyGol,Bungie's ability to tell the story of Destiny could and should be so much better...,"To preface this; I'm a lore nut. Have been since day one and I'll read every card, book and item description until my eyes bleed. But there's a problem, I'm in the minority,

I have friends who have played these games since September 2014 and have absolutely zero idea as to why I've been harping on about the importance of Felwinter and his potential part in the season, as well as that of SIVA. I've been in LFG groups with people who didn't understand how the Vex of the Sol Divisive and the Black Garden tie in with the Pyramid Ships and Darkness as a whole. I've seen Guardian's in this very sub reveal they don't know who Xivu Arath is outside of being Oryx and Savathun's sister. My point it, Bungie's methods of getting the story out to the average player needs to be more direct.

We need to start seeing more exposition driven cutscenes like those from Shadowkeep with Eris, not just Saint-XIV headbutting Vex or Zavala and Ana pew-pewing Cabal on the Almighty. Even slide-shot type scenes with the main vendor of the season expanding on what we're doing, why we're doing it and what it will lead to would be a huge step in the right direction. I'd also like to see our Guardian ask questions, show an interest in learning why they're being sent in to slaughter another hoard of Hive rather than just blindly following orders. We're the slayer of Crota and Oryx for Traveler's sake, we've been the core of the Vault of Glass, the heart of the Black Garden, we forced most of the Fallen Houses to collapse in on themselves, we wiped out every Cabal Commander in the Sol system and have probably done it again since the Red Legion arrived. All of this (and more) with little more than a few lines, lots of nodding and shrugging while our Ghost waffles on on our behalf.

Maybe it's just me, but I'd like to be immersed into Destiny's story and lore directly, shove in my face and make me care about it. I also want these stories to lead somewhere even remotely resembling an end point because really, so very few of Destiny's plot-lines have actually been wrapped up and if they have, it's usually been followed by a consequence that starts up a sequel to said plot that only adds to the ever growing pile.

So, TL/DR: I believe Bungie can and should do a lot better in telling the story of Destiny outside of written lore through more in-depth cutscenes, voiced exposition-dump slideshows and character interactions. Our Guardian should also talk more, ask more questions and be more of a character than the little light who's only job should be to provide friendly support and rez me when I decide I've had enough of the Iron Banner quest and want to throw myself off the Tower repeatedly for ten minutes while listening to 'Bring Me To Life' by Evanescence...

fpnsvv,OmegaDonut13,Universal exotic Mod Catalyst idea,"Just an idea that popped in my head:

A major, common complaint is that the mod system for seasonal modifiers is too limiting.  You can’t use an exotic hand cannon to get overload shot but any legendary would do.  
My idea:  an expensive (materials not eververse!) purchasable catalyst that works in any exotic that replaces the catalyst slot with a mod slot.  Want barrier breaker on your exotic sub machine gun?  Get the mod catalyst and equip the mod. 
If you have an existing catalyst you can swap for a glimmer cost between the mod catalyst and the innate exotic specific.  

This would open up more builds to end game content, as well as potentially buffing some exotics in pve and pvp.

I remember back in destiny 1 when I had every exotic in the game (year 1 and 2,and 3) I felt special like that was difficult to do, I evenhad the adept raid weapons , but now having every exotic in the game feels normal, right now there is nothing interesting for me to grind to because no matter how hard I grind there will be no reward. I feel like there is no reason to play right now. I used to feel excited and rewarded for: going flawless, finishing heroic raids, getting every exotic, but now there is no reward for flawless, raids feel useless and grindy and exotics are mostly worthless and extremely easy to get.

fpnjp4,Tigerstorm6,"If no new ritual weapons are coming, perhaps it’s time for the rest of the Vanguard and Crucible weapons to be reprised.","With Bungie more or less giving Trials a huge focus and ritual weapons more or less taking a dive, it would be a great opportunity to bring bring back some older weapons from Y1 and add them into their respective loot pools. 

For reference and example: These are the weapons that did not get reprised during year 2 or 3.

Vanguard: 
-Origin Story (Kinetic Auto)
-Positive Outlook (Energy Auto)
-Spoiler Alert (Kinetic Sidearm)
-The Showrunner (Kinetic SMG)
-Eternal Blazon (Energy scout Rifle)
-Deadpan Delivery (Energy Shotgun)
-Double Edged Answer (Sword)
-Wicked Sister (Power Grenade Launcher)
-Permanent Truth (Power Grenade Launcher)
-Curtain Call (Rocket)

Crucible
-Martyrs Make (Energy Auto)
-Autumn Wind (Kinetic Pulse Rifle)
-The Marine (Kinetic Pulse Rifle)  
-Retrofuturist (Energy Shotgun)
-Critical Sass (Fusion Rifle)
-Gentleman’s Vagabond (Energy Sniper)
-Tiebreaker (Rocket Launcher)

These are some weapons that not only had really good stats and such, but they also can help fit many rolls. For example, outside of Recluse, we don’t have a lot of SMG’s with decent perks or stats in the kinetic or energy slots. 

Another example I could give is the lack of any decent 450 Autos in the kinetic slot aside from Tigerspite. I don’t count Breakneck since it still is kinda shite. 

I don’t expect them to be reintroduced in the next season or anything like that, but it would certainly give me more reason to spend both my crucible and Vanguard tokens.",11,1585270531,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpnjp4/if_no_new_ritual_weapons_are_coming_perhaps_its/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpnfxd,Feenix342342,A fun game mode suggestion.,"Just had a thought of a fun game mode. Standard PvP teams 6v6 and it can be played free for all or team based. The game: You all start with a specific (chosen per week) 2 of each gun type (i.e. start with 2 pre-chosen sidearms) then move up to hand cannon then up to scout, then pulse, all the way through the different weapon types. You would even have to have a melee kill and a grenade kill. A kill with the weapon advances you to the next one. First person to advance to the final (whatever it may be) and gets a kill with it wins. Then the next week, Bungie picks a new set of 2 per weapon type and so on.

Campaign missions, overall, are a good way to tell a story but are a huge waste of replayability effort as &lt;10% of them can feasibly be replayable as strikes or otherwise. Moving away from campaign missions and moving towards world-changing events is brilliant. (Though the odd really impactful mission will be appreciated)

 \- Some people dislike this, but making new weapons with less reload-damage perk combos and instead warmind (or otherwise) synergies is a good direction. Slapping ***THE BEST*** perks on every weapon is only going to make the best of the best shine and make everything else completely irrelevant. Having weapons with different purposes (shotguns w/ 1-2 punch vs shotguns for pure PvP range) will add a healthy bump to weapon purpose as well as giving many weapons a desirable chase.

\- Making an infrastructure. Armor 2.0, New gamemodes (Trials), Fixing/Tuning old gamemodes, weapon sunsetting, Emblem trackers, etc. All these things are made so that, in the future, things can be created and put out much easier and much quicker provided they fit in the mold. Less time spent tuning, more time spent adding.

\- One of the most important ones for me personally: keeping active on social media. Though they receive *unending* hate, the community management team is constantly reading, replying, and gathering community info. Every single day I see twitter and reddit replies, and I'm sure replies on other sites I don't frequent. Knowing what's going on behind the scenes - knowing I'm supporting a crew who *cares* over a crew who wants money or my gametime - is vital to my playing experience.

Bungie has created two games that have collected the most of my gametime of any game and have kept me playing and interested for nearly 5 years. That isn't something I can say for many, if any, games out there right now. A dev team can't do that unless they really do care about the playerbase and game.

I have one request of the team. **Be transparent**. I will spend hours, dollars, whatever into a game I know is being cared for by honest people. Do that by answering some of our loudest questions.

Why so much effort into the Eververse shop instead of giving us in-game rewards?  
\- If we were to hear, ""We're struggling with money. We need the EV shop to keep afloat."" that'll be so much better than nothing at all. 

Why so little content? (Something I don't think is entirely fair but a common question)  
\- If we hear, ""We're trying, just uninspired"", or ""We're really struggling with the tools we have available"" that's so much better than nothing at all.

Keep us in the loop. You've been doing this well, keep doing it.",6,1585269841,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpnddn/lot_of_negativity_recently_lets_talk_about_stuff/,DestinyTheGame,1

This converts an exotic that makes close range enocunters heavily tilted in the users favor in an uncompetitive way and turns it into an exotic about avoiding damage and manuvering to close the distance. 

To compensate and aid in this new roll the length between shielded slides should be extended out to 3 seconds and the super energy rewarded on deflected shots re-weighted as currently if you reflect huge chunks of damage or enemy projectile supers you can gain large amounts of super energy instantly.

Its no secret if youve played comp or trials that the tunings granted to antaeus have made it wildly uncompetitive and I think this needs to be changed.",5,1585268727,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpn2j9/a_suggestion_to_make_antaeus_less_uncompetitive/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpmnrd,VolcanicBear,The real reason for the god awful iron banner quest...,"It's to completely bugger the skill based matchmaking, giving everyone a super good time when they're finished with it! 

Think about it - it's an unquestionable fact that Control and Iron Banner players don't like capturing points. So when everyone has got their 25 Spare Rations or Ace of Spades kills, they get to move onto their Definitely Earned, Not Purchased, Recluse kills... All pretty easy, standard fare so far right?

Then they get to move onto bow or fusion rifle kills or some shit, I can't remember the order. A whole ten or fifteen of them, but wait! They're coupled with capturing control points. Here's where Bungie's plan comes into action. The slightly below average player struggles to get kills with these weapons, all the while making sure they still don't capture points because _what fucking losers play the objective, right?!_

A few lucky final blow steals and accidental spawns on top of control points later, and the fools who only play games for fun have finished their Iron Banana quest... free to go back to pointing Hard Light in the general direction of the red bit of that circle in the corner!

In the process, their elo or whateverthefuck had been ruined... Meaning when they actually play with weapons they enjoy, something they might even consider to be their own way, they're matched with people worse than them and get to have a few fun games being massively higher skilled than the people they're fighting.

Then skill based matchmaking promptly realises they're playing solo so puts them against Sweaty McSixStack like it's meant to.",2,1585267159,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpmnrd/the_real_reason_for_the_god_awful_iron_banner/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpme4n,spiderdud3,A suggested fix to sweats farming trials,"Obviously, there has been lots of problems regarding last weeks trials. You had sweaty unbrokens gatekeeping the first 3 wins from casuals, which is clearly the problem.
Here are the problems of trials and how to fix them:

1. Sweats farming casuals
Giving trials weapons curated rolls would stop sweats farming casuals for guns as well as giving casuals an incentive to play for a guaranteed good weapon

2. Little to no incentive for a pve player to play because they can’t compete
Having trials weekly bounties that guarantees gear as well as having random drops at the end of matches would prevent skill creep from happening and a wide spectrum of skill levels playing the mode 

3. Better map selection
I get that Bungie wanted to bring back anomaly, but the map is far too technical for casuals to excel and upset great players on. The map is incredibly complicated and less linear compared to other maps that cause strong players to stomp and gives very little margin for the underdog to upset another team.

If there’s anything else to add please comment, overall I just feel like Bungie is killing trials by incentivizing good players to farm casuals and will eventually die because of it.",12,1585266222,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpme4n/a_suggested_fix_to_sweats_farming_trials/,DestinyTheGame,1

fplsvh,DrHershey,Bungie should permanently remove almost all the year 1 armour sets.,"So we all know how utterly useless almost all of the year 1 armour is. It’s just there in our collections for the sake of just being there and to complete different collection types. In fact since the armour 2.0 introduction and the re-releasing of a lot of year 1 armour sets makes the *original* year 1 armour even more pointless.

At this point the game is 165+ GBs. And it is clear now that Bungie is in no shape to keep such a huge game in even remotely stable state. And now they also are struggling to add more content because of various reasons INCLUDING the ever expanding game size, not to mention year 4 is already being planned. 

So what I propose is that Bungie should take a poll and some feedback from it’s player-base, howsoever they can, and just determine which armour set the players wouldn’t want gone in the upcoming times. Once that has been clarified and decided they should truly just permanently remove all the other armour sets from year 1 permanently. This would also open up space to introduce ‘fresh’ designs rather than re-skinning every other set. 

In my opinion it will only help the game because at this point all that armour just lying in the collections tab (or the game files) is just like that extra stuff you hoard in your room because you feel like it will come in handy at some point but in reality it never does. It just stays in your room, taking space and cramping up the room. That is how all of the year 1 armour is for this game, useless and taking up space that could be utilised for improved content. 

Besides it will also help reduce the game size, further reducing the load on the game. I would comment on removing the weapons too but since Bungie decided they will be retiring older weapons I guess it wont be needed, besides a lot of the weapons, even from year 1, are really good.",1,1585264108,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fplsvh/bungie_should_permanently_remove_almost_all_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

A few clan mates and other people I have met have also reported similar issues, though it does not seem to affect everyone. This, alongside the fact I do not experience this issue with the majority of weapons, makes me certain that this is not a hardware issue.

The third and final perk states that Rasputin resource frames are much more efficient collectors: collection rate increased. For those that can read and understand English, this means you should get more materials more often. Yet, the resource frame only gave me ONE planetary material.

fplgrh,Justin_Fox,Tough titties if your RNG sux ass,"I'm reading a whole lot of people complaining about not getting that last piece to get them to the 1000 level cap, or people getting multiple pinnacles dropping in the same slot. 

I've also heard Bungie are potentially addressing this in future which would make it easier for people to hit the level cap... but I sincerely hope they don't. 

Why?

Well, because as it is right now, there's not a lot of aspirational content in the game. IE: There's not many situations in the game where you feel absolute ELATION. 

In D1, getting a Ghalahorn to drop made you scream out loud and physically punch the sky and jump up and down with joy. That feeling of finally getting that thing that you've been grinding for for ages feels SO good. Money can't buy it! It's like winning big at the roulette table, or beating that final boss in The Surge or Dark Souls. 

From my observations; having absolutely awesome RNG on my main and getting that last 1000 piece easy made for heavy LOLs on our team chat, but getting a whole tonne of weapons at 1000 on my alt instead of that final armour piece definitely had me loathing and complaining UNTIL I finally got it, where I felt elation. IE: Win win, both getting it easy felt good, but getting it after not getting it for a week (or more) felt just as good, if not better (relief!). 

I hope Bungie don't address this IMHO ""non-issue"", as I feel the game is getting easier and easier over time and the power grind (and emotion I attach to it) is one of the few things I still really love about the game.",6,1585262915,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fplgrh/tough_titties_if_your_rng_sux_ass/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpldr8,theyoyomaster,Bungie... STAHP,"Ok, part Bungie suggestion part rant but it's getting ridiculous. 

Bungie, you really need to learn that there are a ton of players, possibly a strong majority, that *don't like PvP.* Seriously. If you take Destiny without the Crucible, it is an amazing PvP looter shooter with good lore and a huge universe/fanbase. If you take the Crucible without the rest of Destiny you have... one of the worst standalone PvP experiences out there. Destiny without the Crucible is still Destiny, the Crucible without Destiny is worthless and you would go bankrupt. SO STOP SCREWING OVER PvE PLAYERS FOR THE CRUCIBLE.

In my first week of (not) working from home, I spent an absurd amount of time on the new season. I fully upgraded the EDZ bunker and happily ground for hours and hours and hours. I am one of the few that isn't bitching at all about the current PvE season, I love the Warmind theme and enjoy the concepts (with just a few gripes like only having short range weapons being viable).

On the other side of the equation, I have never played Trials a day in my life on D1 or D2. I will never load it up or play a single match, regardless of anything you ever do. I do not enjoy PvP Destiny, at all, under any circumstance, ever. Any time you try and force me into PvP, I end up angry at the game and rage quitting for extended periods of time. SO STOP FREAKIN FORCING ME INTO IT. If you spent all of your time working on Trials loot, then why is the *only* pinnacle weapon Iron Banner? Is it because you honestly hate PvE players and want to fuck us? Seriously, PvP and PvE need to be separate. PvP players should never feel compelled to play PvE and PvE players should never feel compelled to play PvP. This season you, yet again, showed that you absolutely play favorites and that PvP is the favorite child, despite being the blah side that has limited appeal and *not* the core draw to your game. Yes, you brought some PvP D1 players back to bump your current numbers, but it's short term gains that will result in an overall loss. My family members that play (and even dabble in PvP every here and there unlike me) quit playing the second they saw Trials announced because they know it brings the worst out in the PvP community and they, correctly, guessed that you would screw over PvE for the entire season to try earn a quick buck with Trials. You have proven them 100% correct.

Finally, I don't even care if you listen or respond because it's too late anyway. As I was grinding every bunker daily bounty and 10+ purchased bounties a day for warmind bits in the first/second weeks to realizing I needed a better submachine gun since ""play your way"" means ""play only our way, especially if it's the worst way #GETSTOMPED"" so I dared to try and get Recluse. 12 comp matches later and I'm now playing the Division for the rest of quarantine. You had me hook line and sinker to play D2 nonstop for the next several months of being stuck at home, and you forced me into the Crucible and lost me completely.

fpld26,eggfacemcticklesnort,Gambit is currently the best game mode in the game (yuck),"Hear me out. Gambit and its associated modes (Prime, Reckoning) are currently the best core modes in the game, in terms of reward systems. I absolutely cant stand playing it sometimes, to be sure, it can be a frustrating experience when the enemy team seems to have an unending supply of heavy and your team isnt getting any. And I wholly believe the bonuses for all roles in Prime need to be reworked. 

However, the lack of Gambit tokens is what makes this mode the best one, and most reminiscent of D1. I dont have 1500 tokens held over from years of playing to turn in at the beginning of each new season. You want Gambit weapons and armor? You have to complete weekly bounties, or upgrade your rank by playing the game. You want Prime weapons? You HAVE to grind Reckoning, or play Prime. There is no token system allowing you to get all of the items in 15 minutes or less. You simply have to play the game mode. This makes the loot feel more special IMO, and when you get a great roll on something, you know you earned it (and had a bit of luck).",76,1585262496,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpld26/gambit_is_currently_the_best_game_mode_in_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpl4m4,Frostyhobo47,Outside of doing low mans and other stuff like that there is almost no reason to run a warlock for pve.,"outside of low mans (doing things with less than the number of recommended players) and other very niche things in pve warlocks basically present no argument for their use. This is based off of many many raids, dungeons, nightfalls completions and is simply my personal opinion. 

**Neutral game and exotics:**

The primary reason people use warlocks in these sort of activities is for lunafaction boots with their rifts/well of radiance; now the this wouldn't be that bad, but when you look at the fact that titans can simply use their tiny barricade and net the same result it really points out the necessity to have a warlock doing this.

Warlocks don't have any sort of exotics that buff certain weapons in any significant manner, so getting some niche combo like actium war rigs and an lmg doesn't exist for a warlock so warlock exotics really affect abilities in some way.

Healing rift, and healing grenades are all good and dandy, however being more familiar with an activity means that you probably remember certain enemy spawns, champions, high risk areas, etc. so with more experience means you know what to expect so healing grenades and quick healing rifts aren't needed that much at that point as well as hunter and titans already having many of their own sources of shielding or healing or turning invisible from passives or exotics. 

Empowering rifts are truly unique and are good at times, but most people that play warlock don't run an empowering rift b/c you can't deal damage when you are dead and healing rift is the only way to help with not dying. Empowering is good, it's more of thing that you switch to for a specific situation instead of being the primary rift that you run as a warlock.

**Supers:**

I was originally going to break this down into each subclass, but then I realized I was basically saying the same thing.

 You need to compare similar supers, for example you wouldn't compare a roaming super to an instant cast super cause they are completely different, one gives the player a burst of damage/buff/etc. and the other gives the player a time period to be able to perform some super actions.

This is how I compare supers across classes:

**Instant cast damage supers**

* Nova bombs (both of them)
* celestial golden gun (technically isn't but celestial essentially makes it an instant cast)
* Blade barrage
* Code of the missile titan

**Instant cast support supers**

* Top tree tether
* Well of radiance
* top void titan specifically casting the bubble only 

 **Damage Roaming supers** 

* All arc warlock supers
* Dawnbreaker supers (top and bottom solar warlock)
* Nova warp
* non-celestial hunter golden gun
* All arc hunter supers
* void stalker 
* Striker titans (top and bottom arc titan)
* All solar Titan supers
* top and bottom void titan minus casting the bubble specifically 

**Misc roaming supers** (basically these don't fit in the other categories, but there are no warlock supers in here so we can essentially ignore these for the means of this topic) 

* quiver void hunter 
* Middle void titan

 

**Comparing within their subgroups:**

For the instant cast damage supers, the singular objective of these supers are to deal the most damage in the least amount of time, and obviously celestial golden gun takes the cake. (As it should, I believe it is the singularly best designed exotic in the game). Nothing even comes close to celestial.

For instant cast support supers, you can either buff or debuff. Since tether is the only debuff super in the game it is clearly the best as well. The remaining two supers are both buffing supers, and with the removal of stacking buffs you can only be affected by the highest buff at a time bubble takes the cake on that one b/c it simply gives a bigger damage buff.

For damage roaming supers, there is a ton here, but their jobs are all basically the same thing, orb generation/add clear, however lets be honest there is nothing in the game where this actually an important role, for raids there are no encounters that take so long where the adds begin to overwhelm you nor any encounters where you have to use your other supers frequently enough where orb generation would be a concern; even then you can just use masterworked weapons to do the same thing. I would generally say that all of these supers can probably perform about the same at this job so I would just say they are all equal at this.

**So what does this show?**

If I replace the groups with the class that posses the super that were the best for their subgroup it will reveal the following 

**Instant cast damage supers**

* Hunter

**Instant cast support supers**

* Hunter (debuff)
* Titan (buff)

 **Damage Roaming supers** 

*  Hunter,Titan, Warlock (all evenly)

&amp;#x200B;

**ok... but supers aren't everything.**

Ok you got me there, I guess I just forgot about all those warlock debuffs like melting point.

Or perhaps the warlock instant reloads like hunter dodges,.

Maybe even all those invisible warlocks I hear floofing around me.

/s if that wasn't overtly obvious that was satire. But in all honesty warlock neutral game is nowhere near the level of power as the other classes, and even if it is you're still basically bringing nothing to a boss fight b/c every super a warlock has gets outclassed by another super.

# Going into pve stuff as a warlock I feel so much less important to the team b/c I can be replaced by a titan class ability usage.

If I haven't convinced you I would like to discuss this with you, do remember I am not talking about low-mans or things of that sort im talking about vanilla raids/dungeons/Nightfalls/etc., just vanilla pve content where you can have a coordinated team.",2,1585261637,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpl4m4/outside_of_doing_low_mans_and_other_stuff_like/,DestinyTheGame,1

Artifact Mods - I like the artifact mod system, quite a bit actually, but I have some problems with how the core mods (antibarrier, overload, and unstoppable) work. Having the mods be restricted to certain weapons hurts the ""play your way"" mentality, and overall restricts the fun I can have during a nightfall, or legendary lost sector as this season has. 

* Anti-Barrier: Honestly don't have many complaints about it, other than if they are on anything that isn't an ar or smg barriers get hard to destroy 
* Unstoppable: No complaints about these, so far everything works fine with them.
* Overload: These are my least favorite mods and champions, Overloads are hard to use due to needing damage to proc and champions teleporting way too much to be able to stagger them. I'd prefer them to be always active, or for champion AI to be changed so they don't continually move around and prevent staggers.

Core Content - I find that it's hard to really complain about the content, I quite enjoy not having so much to do, though I wish there was more to do at some points. 

* Strikes: My biggest problem with strikes is that I don't enjoy running them, mainly because I don't feel incentivized to run them, while content for every single strike would be nice, I understand that's harder to do as Bungie is alone now. But being able to get certain gear from strikes would be nice, let's say I run a Corruption strike, and instead of getting a random blue at the end, I get a reverie dawn piece, or a Dreaming City weapon. I feel like that would make me want to run strikes more. 
* Crucible: I don't have many problems with crucible, though I feel like weapons should be changed quicker than 3-6 months, and that matchmaking needs to be both based on skill and connection, no matter how good I am at crucible, if I'm fighting someone halfway across the world, it's not a fair fight.
* Gambit: I think Gambit has the same problem as Strikes, I don't feel like I am incentivized to do it, and the rewards aren't great for doing it. I don't have much to say to fix it, I don't play it enough to have any suggestions,

Seasonal Content: I'm going to be completely honest, I don't have much to say here, I'm enjoying the seasons so far, and don't have many problems with it, not having 1000+ things to do allows me to play other games, which is nice for a change. 

Welp that's all I have to say, thanks for reading :\^)",2,1585260984,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpkxn9/a_semihardcore_players_opinions_on_these_past_few/,DestinyTheGame,1

Basically, our options are: 

Xenophage + Actium War Rig (Titan) or Dodge Reload (Hunter)

1K Voices

Whisper

Izanagi + one of the good Grenade Launchers (Wendigo, Love and Death, Interference, Swarm of the Raven)

He left out Anarchy + Special Weapon as that can’t be used in GoS. But he makes no mention of Eriana’s Vow with its Exotic Catalyst that gives it 9 rounds in the mag + Auto-Loading Holster. 

Ehroar reviewed it several months ago here:

https://youtu.be/cl9GhLLzNCA

Now, it’s DPS numbers with Catalyst are higher than all post-nerf Special Ammo Sniper Rifles with Vorpal or Firing Line, and it pairs perfectly with Wendigo as both have Auto-Loading Holster.

fpknrx,DTG_Bot,This Week At Bungie 3/26/2020,"Source: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48878

---

This week at Bungie, a new bunker was discovered. 


Doors, once hidden, open on the lunar surface revealing another Seraph Bunker in Rasputin’s network. Guardians have begun exploring it to see what upgrades lie within. And if you’re up for the challenge, there are also new Legendary Lost Sectors available and new weapons to get your hands on.


That’s not all. Lord Saladin is at the Tower and has a new Bow for you to earn along with several opportunities for pinnacle drops. On top of all that, week three of Trials of Osiris begins tomorrow. What map do you think will be featured this week?


***



##World Drops

There were several armor sets added to the engram loot pool with Season of the Worthy. We saw a lot of feedback that, while you were excited to see your favorite armor sets from the past, the fact that none of them had Seasonal mod slots made them feel less desirable and not worth including in your builds.


Good news! We’re adding Seasonal mod slots to these sets in an update next month. The three faction sets will get Season of the Worthy mod slots and the rest of the armor will get either Season of Dawn or Season of the Undying mod slots.


**Season of Dawn Mod Slot Added:**



* Dead End Cure
* Retro-Grade TG2
* Heiro Camo
* Road Complex AA1
* Devastation Complex
* High-Minded Complex


**Season of the Undying Mod Slot Added:**



* Red Moon Phantom
* Mimetic Savior
* Thorium Holt
* Tangled Web
* Prodigal
* Frumious
* Noble Constant Type 2
* Ego Talon IV
* Errant Knight
* Kerak Type 2
* Philomath


All of these sets will be able to use Seasonal mods from the Seasons before and after the Season they are designated above (as explained in a [previous TWAB](https://www.bungie.net/en-us/Explore/Detail/News/48727)).


***



##The Fixings 

We are currently targeting Tuesday, March 31 to deploy Hotfix 2.8.0.2. The main target of this update will be the issue affecting Trials of Osiris challenges not being reset properly. Here’s a quick preview of other fixes coming in this update:



* Fixed an issue where upgrades on the Season Pass where only unlocked for one character and will now properly unlock for the entire account.
* Fixed an issue where the first weekly clear of a Legendary Lost Sector would not award a powerful drop.
* Fixed an issue with Raiju’s Harness that allowed players to hold Whirlwind Guard indefinitely.
* Fixed an issue where Titan Season Pass arms ornament would block first person view.
* Season Pass SMG and Shotgun will now create Warmind cells with Season Pass ornaments equipped.
* Fixed an issue where Sentinel Titans were able to extend Sentinel Shield/Banner Shield by suppressing themselves.
* Fixed an issue where players were not getting the correct amount of planetary materials from bunker upgrades.


Aside from the fixes in 2.8.0.2 we’re also continuing to investigate disconnects, crashes, and error codes being reported since 2.8.0 we released. Currently, we are seeing elevated disconnects from the Tower on all platforms but disconnects from other activities seems PC-specific.


The fix we deployed has appeared to resolve the crashes affecting Gambit, but didn’t help with other disconnects. We have made additional attempts at fixing disconnects that haven’t resulted in a decline in error codes and are continuing to work on new fixes for elevated Beaver, Beetle, Anteater, and Rabbit errors. We’ll give you more information as soon as we can.

[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/132/132994/D2_DPS_Gif.gif)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/hJRJZFS.gif)



Destiny Player Support is constantly tracking known issues in the wild.


This is their report. 

&gt;
&gt;###TRIALS WEEKLY CHALLENGE RESET TIME
&gt;
&gt;Last weekend, Destiny Player Support noticed an increase in reports about players not receiving powerful rewards from their third, fifth, or seventh Trials of Osiris win. Upon investigation, the team discovered an error in the Weekly Challenge reset time. 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Trials of Osiris Weekly Challenges will unlock at 5 PM PDT on Saturdays. At this time, rewards are expected to be reset for players who have been impacted, and rewards will be granted when players reach three, five, or seven wins respectively. In a future patch, we will move this reset to the Friday daily reset.
&gt;
&gt;###SEASON OF THE WORTHY SEAL
&gt;
&gt;We have noticed that players have been trying unsuccessfully to unlock a hidden Triumph in the Season of the Worthy Almighty Seal when meeting the requirements. This Triumph is not currently available to unlock but will be so in late April.
&gt;
&gt;###RASPUTIN BUNKER BOUNTIES
&gt;
&gt;With the Moon Bunker now unlocked, Destiny Player Support noticed some confusion about the bounties Rasputin offered. Weekly and daily Rasputin bounties are only available on the destination where the Weekly Challenge is active.
&gt;
&gt;###CURRENT KNOWN ISSUES
&gt;
&gt;While we continue investigating various [known issues](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179), here’s a list of the latest issues that were reported to us in our [#Help Forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help):
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;* Some players may not receive progress on **Crucible and Iron Banner quests and bounties**. These are caused by connection issues and continuing to play will progress these objectives.
&gt;* **Rasputin’s Daily Seraph Weapon** can only be claimed on the character players were on when Rank 92 of the Season Pass was unlocked – this cannot be claimed on other characters.
&gt;* The “**Lost Classics” Rasputin bounty** does not count Crucible matches in the Classic Mix playlist.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;For a full list of emergent issues in Destiny 2, players can review our [Known Issues article](https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48179). Players who observe other issues should report them to our [#Help forum](https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Topics/?tg=Help).

fpkek0,Mor0nSoldier,"Grinding for Pinnacles is hard as it is, on top of it getting only 2 armor pieces out of 12 Pinnacle Bounties is absolutely disheartening and needs addressing.","To make it worse -- both of the Armor pieces I got were for the same on the same class, both Helmets for the Titan. :/

On top of that how bad of an RNG it is to get just 1 drop in Kinetic slot? Had a similar situation during Season of Dawn's Iron Banner(2nd arrival).

It wouldn't break the game Bungie if you make it so that 2 of the 4 bounties are guaranteed Armor drops and the rest 2 can be  guaranteed weapons. That will have enough ""aspirational loot"" for me as a PvE player to force through Iron Banner.

I loved how completing Iron Banner bounties would grant you specific Armor pieces for each slot during some of the Pre-Shadowkeep seasons. At least there was a reason to grind and hustle through Iron Banner.

But now its just... even more RNG on top of the already existing bad enough RNG.

fpkeds,CDRMoseley,Trials....... Is not fun.,"Now I'm trying to not make this a hate post. And please don't come in here and say ""just don't suck"" cause that crap is old. Also let it be known, I'm pretty casual about this game until recently because corona lost me my job and I wanted to grind light level to play trials. So hear me out.

I don't suck at pvp, on PS4 I held a 1.8 KDA higher then most. I switched over to PC. I'm not as good still learning the M&amp;K but I hold my own, and hold about a 1.5 kda, and also always have the most damage, I would tell you my fight me medals but hey got rid of that counter soooo :/. Like I said I'm no god tier player, but better then most.

Now I still have yet to go flawless, I have yet to even get anywhere near going flawless. I have over 1k elims in trials right now. I've gotten to my 7th game once. And for some reason, after I would hit 3 wins. After that every game just became a total stomp out. I've run trials with lfg groups, multiple friends, PC and PS4. And every time have yet to even get close to getting a card that has gone flawless. And to be honest, it's not fun anymore. I've tried and tried and still even haven't come close. Idk anymore it's not fun to have to reset my card every 2-3 wins. It's not fun to go up against sweaties with 37 flawless cards and get completely shit on in round 2. I find myself not playing because the frustration of getting no progress is really degrading. And I honestly don't know how to change my out come anymore. 

Maybe put people who have gone flawless against people who also have that week. Idk maybe I'm just so fucking bad I have accept that I will never go flawless. It's just frustrating to feel that I'm locked out of experiencing something when I know I have the skills to get there, yet I'm still no where near to accomplishing it.

Sorry for the long post, and I know I probably said the same shit over and over. But that's how I feel.

fpkbho,dillpicklezzz,Rifled Vs Full Choke Testing,"\*\*Obligatory No i'm not affiliated with this person/channel in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of us are waiting for Fallout to release his post-Worthy shotgun findings, but in the meantime, people continue to claim ""Barrel X is greater than Y on Shotgun Z"" without any evidence to back it up. Here's a video from CastleIsLive that u/rjld333 recommended yesterday with results from testing various shotguns and barrels that *seems* like it was tested correctly - [https://youtu.be/-D0zdn47rvI](https://youtu.be/-D0zdn47rvI). Aside from the quirky/weird moments from the YTer, it's a solid and informative video that I recommend you watch all the way through.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: **Full Choke and Rifled are basically tied on Aggressive Frames, although the YTer does recommend Full Choke in the comments below the video**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Edit 1: Rifled is still perfectly fine especially if you're in the air a lot. They were almost the same in results. Full-choke slightly better over the 500+ tests but rifled is still completely ok and I should have included it at the end.",0,1585258921,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpkbho/rifled_vs_full_choke_testing/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpk6ye,Atlas_Zer0o,With the rate bungie stated they can put out weapons will sunsetting create a very specific meta?,"I was worried about sunsetting at first, a hugely unnecessary move that limits the ways we can play. Then with the new seraph weapon system I got a bit more excited hoping to see innovative systems like that.

However with the now infamous ""trials or ritual weapons"" statement I dont see how bungie could sunset weapons and reliably put out even a small portion of that for the undetermined amount of time they are limiting the weapons to. Even all the weapons for y3 themselves isn't much variation, including the y1 rehashes and reskins added.

Will this just create an even more specific meta than the seasonal artifact has? It almost feels like they're trying to create gjallahorn type chases each season by heavily reinforcing what you should use. Any season without a high impact fusion would kill fusions completely, even worse than they already are, not even including seasons like this that have extremely sparse Arsenal's added that are tied to seasonal perks.

Maybe it's me being wary because they somehow fumble every chance they get but I'm worried about endgame come sunsetting, it's going to be very elitist and cookie cutter much like D1 was.",1,1585258492,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpk6ye/with_the_rate_bungie_stated_they_can_put_out/,DestinyTheGame,1

Its not that hard a concept and i wish bungie would not do their ""reinvent the wheel"" on this and just give a plain jane horde mode. Kill hard things in large number get loot, pretty simple.

Now that we know what a horde mode bungie lets talk about your release cycle. Your company constantly is lowering the bar on what you say you can produce yet we have a year at 4 dlcs. Maybe you should try to produce at a slower rate and make content with more depth. You say we have to CHOOSE BETWEEN RITUALS OR TRIALS WEAPONS. Then maybe put some of the EV in the game as unique loot models for armor, ships, or sparrows. You think that constantly having new mundane content that the gravy train will keep going but I think youre endangering yourself longterm as people are unhappy with their product and are just coming for the fix. Youre living off a F2P high thats not going to last much longer imo. Once trials hits a point of normal people and lower end skill players leave trials then your ace in the hole will begin wilt.

fpjlqx,Andrea_102,The story of how a mediocre PvP player finally got his recluse in one night,"Hey guys. I'm making this post both as a celebration, as well as an encouragement to other players that are afraid of jumping into comp.

A little back story, I've been playing Destiny since Day 1 of D1, and for the entire duration of that game I played relentlessly day and night, made amazing friends and practically grew up with it(am 18 now, was 12 when I first started). I have a deep connection with this game and no matter how bad, or frustrating it gets, I  just start playing q few weeks after deciding to ""quit for good"". Back in D1 I was quite a decent PvP player and went flawless more than 3 times a week, but after life stuff happened I couldn't play for more than 8 months and naturally I ended up losing all of my aim, what followed was a cicle of ""this is too much sensitivity, this is too low"" and I finally ended up losing all the aim I developed over the years of playing as a kid, but I digress. What will follow is some of my thoughts on the experience of playing, and getting better at PvP.

I religiously avoided PvP during D2 because I was utter garbage at it, but over the last few months I have been playing R6 and my aim improved tremendously and I figured I would go back to destiny and see how I fared there, especially since the new season was dropping. Shortly after I remembered watching a video from RickKackis about how comp was the best way to level up, but I was hesitant at first. Nonetheless I drop in and I play a few games until I rank up twice, after that I stop for about a week to do some PvE. Last night I went back into comp since I had nothing better to do (Thanks Coronavirus) and in just a few games I reach heroic 2. At this point I didn't wanna leave anymore, even if I had a shitty rapid fire shotgun that couldn't 1 shot enemies even if I begged it to, and even if I hated the recoil on the hard light(I'll get to that in just a sec). I keep playing and playing and reach a plateau. I went on losing streak of 4 matches, I was fuming with rage, blaming everything but myself, at this point it was 3 in the morning, but I set an objective for myself, reach Heroic 3. With sheer determination I got back into the fray and won my next 2 matches, it was intense but I did it.

 The morning after I go back to playing and go on several other losing streaks, between some dude that was obviously getting boosted, guys that definitely weren't any rank close to fabled 2 and some lag. Once again I was enraged, but it didn't matter, I had an objective, and I was gonna make sure it was getting done. But sadly I kept getting tilted, started screaming at the top of my lungs at my teammates, my shitty unreliable shotgun, the enemies and their mothers. I was on full tilt, and I was merely 3 games away from glory. Until I realized that getting tilted wasn't gonna help, so I took a deep breath and went on a 3 match winning streak, consistently landing at the top of the leaderboard. And so it was done, I reached the rank I never expected to reach. I soon after go into IB at 977 light to get the final wins needed to get the triumph done, and finally I do it, and claim my long sought after prize.

Here's what I have to say to anyone afraid that they won't make it. Try it, you never know if you're gonna reach it, sometimes it will be luck, sometimes it will be you getting better as you play, you only get better as you struggle.

Now for my 2 cents on the experience. SBMM is absolute bullshit, sometimes it felt like playing against kids that couldn't shoot back, and sometimes it felt like playing again E-sports team, even if I was in the freelance playlist. Rapid fire shotguns are completely useless, as is any shotgun without a good roll, I think this is slightly unfair as not everyone can invest dozens of hours into farming for a mindbender's ambition God roll, but it is in the nature of the game so I digress. But the main point being recoil on console. This is something I am quite adamant about since I believe aiming with a controller is quite challenging, and having aim assist doesn't make it any better. I'm not necessarily arguing for PC like level of recoil, more of readjustment, or a separate sandbox. Controlling erratic, and strong horizontal recoil on console is an absolute nightmare and I really only noticed it as I played with hardlight, and simultaneously seeing PC gameplay of hardlight. The reason why PC players can snipe with it isn't necessarily because of the better aim, its because the recoil is nonexistent, so naturally hardlight is much more powerful on PC than console, and the fact that we have to share the same sandbox is quite damning. But these are just the opinions of a scrub.

Also, why is Light advantage still a thing on IB? Its unfair and frustrating for the general population, it serves no purpose as it is not a competitive playlist like trials and only serves to make the grindiest of players happy that they take less damage and deal more.

Anyhoo guardians, just keep pushing for what you want to achieve even if the odds are stacked against you. And as shaxx told me many times ""The best thing about being a guardian is that you are never truly beaten"". Don't be afraid of exploiting the meta, no matter the hate messages, and never, ever get tilted, it won't help and it is just a vicious cycle of rage.

fpjhv9,SadDokkanBoi,The Trials' weapons tell a story,"As the title says, all the lore of the Trials' weapons tell a story that connect to one another. The story is about a match that happened within the Trials of Osiris. 

The first team consists of people named Sadhij, Trestin, and Yara. (I'll call them team A)

The second team consists of people named Sola, Crimiq-5, and Katake (I'll call them team B)

This story is fairly long so keep that in mind. Also this story takes the view of both teams so I'll try my best to order it in a way that makes sense. Here goes. 

&gt;*Team A (The Summoner):*

""She awaited signal lock, hands loosely bent around flight sticks, sun to her back. Trestin's sight sank into stupor and stretched far across the outshined lights of distant possibilities. Flanking starlight pushed her jumpship's shadow outward into space. It was what it was, and nothing more.

Mercury hung beneath, buried in a storm of solar wind like a dark pit enveloped by ripe flesh. She hadn't returned in years; previous iterations of Trials and constant exposure to the Crucible had sated her curiosities of quietus. None of that mattered anymore. Not after the Moon. It was over. Finality was coming.

Trestin's return was a pretense for preparation; a living funeral to find conclusion on one's own terms. She had begun to see the sense concealed in wanton dissociation, the seriousness underneath the dressings of the Menagerie, the truth in the word ringing through its halls. It was over. Time to make peace.

""Saint-14 is going to be watching us. No pressure."" Sadhij twisted a faded purple ribbon through the plates of his gauntlet and flexed his fingers.

""No pressure at all."" Trestin mouthed the words, barely producing a sound before Yara's voice cut into the chatter.

""Look alive team. We are the thin line drawn before the Darkness. We are Guardians. No holding back.""

Thin. A line to be swallowed in scope. No holding back.

Burning Shrine… Lock… Transmat firing…""

&gt;*Team B (Exile's Curse):*

""Welcome to the Trials of Osiris!"" Saint-14's booming voice rippled across the Shrine like an avalanche.

Katake felt fear wash over him as he advanced toward Pillar. He had heard stories of great and powerful Guardians using Trials as a proving ground, and now they had a legend challenging them to lead. A time for leaders, but that time was not his. He was far more inclined to rewards reaped from victories, and the security of the Reef. The future discarded both those sentiments with callous indignation. This was not a time to look to the future. This was a time to escape it.

""One of 'em's crossed… peeled off toward C-point."" Crimiq-5 crackled over radio.

""I'm on it."" Katake moved right to cut off the opposing team's flanking advance.

""You're out of my sight-line, Katake.""

He met eyes with a flanking Titan barreling toward him, Shotgun in hand. Katake raised his Fusion Rifle, and it whirred to life. The noise carried, and the Titan leapt into a charged meteoritic eruption. Fusion energy ripped through the crackling bolt to no avail as it descended on him.

Katake ran.

""Crimiq… THUNDERCRASH… HELP! NOW—""

Thunder.

""YES!"" Saint-14's voice boomed.

There was a sliver of his being left after the crash. A root, held on baited hook just below a placid screen. A chaos waiting to be returned to order. Somewhere, a Ghost hummed with patience. Soon the Light would fill Katake again and he would live."" 

&gt;*Team A (Astral Horizon):*

""Sadhij opened comms first. ""I'm flanking. They're not going to know what hit them.""

""Don't over-extend, Sadhij. Trestin and I are pushing A-side. Those damn wheels block our firing lines."" The words flew from Yara's lips with concerned purpose.

Trestin chimed in, ""Crimiq's on their fireteam. He laid me out in Crucible a few weeks back—just so you know.""

""Can't stop the lightning, Yara. I just ride it where it takes me."" Sadhij's smile was almost audible.

""You're a goober.""

""You're going to be a dead goober."" Trestin added.

""If you die, die with honor, Guardian!"" Yara's tone struck a chord in his heart, and Sadhij quickened his pace.

He locked eyes with a Guardian down-lane and charged, Shotgun in hand, whipping a lightning grenade toward Pillar to cover his side. Sadhij heard the distinctive revving of a fusion weapon building power and leapt into the air.

""I hope you're watching…""

Sadhij felt the current surge through him and arc through the air, connecting him to his target. As his opponent's Fusion Rifle let loose, Sadhij surrendered himself to the Light. His muscles convulsed as droves of Arc energy pulsed through his nervous system and overtook him. He was a bolt, screaming across the Burning Shrine and painting the arena in the glow of static glory.

A saintly voice confirmed his strike. A smile split across his face. A rifle fired in the distance. A grounded thud heard by none.""

&gt;*Team B (Eye of Sol):*

""It was Crimiq-5's honor to hold the flank. Sun at his back, there was no better position to provide overwatch in the Burning Shrine. He was the watchtower, and none would escape his vigil. Curt radio chatter signaled his fireteam's advance as he called out enemy maneuvers. Crimiq-5 watched tense bursts of movement and exchanges of fire as his team jockeyed for position.

Sola had ripped through their previous opponents with off-putting ferocity, and Crimiq was ready for this to be their last match of the day. He looked over her through his scope. Sola's silhouette marinated in an eerie shimmer that distorted the air as she moved. He stilled his body and sent a shot over her head to force an opponent back into cover.

""Aiming a little close."" Sola sent a glare over her shoulder into the sun.

Crimiq-5 moved his scope off her. ""Duck.""

His earpiece crackled. Katake's voice drilled into his head. ""THUNDERCRASH… Help!""

Katake's voice screeched out of existence as the lightning overtook him and Saint bellowed. Crimiq saw a bright flash burst from the hallway leading toward C-point.

""Be advised, I'm leaving the perch. Moving to trade for Katake.""

He slid into position and snapped his trusted long rifle down lane. His sights found an unlucky Titan, lightning still crackling from their armor.

""Fate Cries Foul for you, brother."" The shot hit squarely, and the Titan dropped. ""Sorry I couldn't save you Katake. Next time.""

&gt;*Team A (Tomorrow's Answer):*

""Yara slammed a rocket into her launcher. ""These crates really skimp on quantity.""

""Sadhij is down."" Trestin turned to Yara. ""This one's alone.""

The words had barely escaped her when a Warlock brimming with Void Light Nova Warped past them. Yara turned and launched a rocket over Trestin's head. The opposing Warlock concentrated her aura of Void energy into her hand and unleashed a supernova blast. The two projectiles collided; void and flame ripped through each other and burst outward, sending all three fighters in different directions.

Yara groaned as her vision began to clear. Her head sang a familiar tune of disoriented pounding and Auto Rifle fire. Fresh blood ran from rigid shrapnel protruding from her leg. ""Trestin… check in.""

No answer. Yara reached blindly through dust and particulate to recover her weapon, but found only scattered bits of stone and debris. Static streaked through her visor, throwing heat signatures directly in front of her through the swirling dust. She knocked the side of her visor to clear the interference. A violet shockwave pushed away the dust. Trestin knelt a few paces away, beaten. The Warlock bent her glowing hand into Trestin's chest plate, lodging a vortex grenade into her armor. Yara met her eyes and saw the Void overtake her. She did not hear the scream, or the splitting armor. She only saw flickers of Trestin break apart and scatter as the vortex ate away at her.

Yara shook the shock-hold on her mind and pulled her Sidearm. She snap-fired a round into the Warlock's shoulder. The Warlock recoiled from the force and whipped an open palm of malformed Void at Yara, releasing unstable energy that shattered the pistol's frame into ragged scraps. ""No more of that.""

""That was cruel. She didn't deserve…""

""None of us 'deserve.' It's about what you can get."" The Warlock smiled and raised a hand of gnarled Void. ""Brace yourself.""

&gt;*Team B (The Scholar):*

""Sola could feel the Light twisting from her prey's core. She jerked her hand, which dripped with hungering power, and plucked at something deeper. Sola worked her power between her prey's ribs and felt them give way. She dug in, in spite of the pleas, feeling for a grip to hoist their Light to the surface and find what hid underneath.

""So…"" Sola's intent bit deeper, malleable claws that flexed against her prey's Light. They probed through blood and muscle to an umbral center. ""…it's within you too.""

Her prey's scream was silenced as a shot rang out from over Sola's shoulder. It struck her opponent square in the temple, and the body collapsed. Sola's perverse Light dissipated.

""What the hell was that?"" Crimiq-5 lashed into her ear.

Before she could answer, Saint-14's voice burst through the arena's audio channel. ""ENOUGH!""

Sola took a step back. A transmat deployment fired behind her. She turned, perplexed at the massive armored figure that now stood before her.

""I do not know what strange Light you are weaving, Warlock, but this is too far.""

""I didn't realize Trials had gone soft.""

""No… your victory stands. This is not the Crucible. There is no punishment, but I will not allow needless torture of a Guardian.""

""Isn't Guardian-on-Guardian violence the point? Strength through death.""

""You are no Guardian."" Saint turned away from Sola and looked to Crimiq-5 as he approached. ""I hope you know what company you keep.""

Crimiq-5 slung his rifle and pierced Sola's visor with livid eyes. He knelt and extended a hand to the broken Guardian's Ghost. ""I'm not a party to this. Not my style.""

Crimiq's eyes scanned the grotesque scene. ""I'm sorry I wasn't faster.""

Sola could feel Saint-14's Light eclipse her own. His hand clenched into a fist. She stifled as much of her temper as she could muster.

""Fine. You're all as good as dead anyway. Good luck with your war.""

Sola turned to leave.

Saint raised his hand to a swatch mark on his helm. ""Geppetto, recall me and get these fighters back on their feet. This match is over.""

And there you have it. To make a long story short, team B has a twisted ass teammate who likes to torture her opponents.",9,1585256196,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpjhv9/the_trials_weapons_tell_a_story/,DestinyTheGame,1

******

I don't want to make this post, as a PVP sweatlord. I want Trials to succeed. But we have to talk about last weekend. **(warning: long read)**

Anomaly returned to extremely negative fanfare. This week was much, much harder to go flawless for a lot of folks, myself included. I played 100 matches and only went flawless once, thanks largely in part to getting error coded several times but also thanks to my fair share of bad mistakes. But the problems this weekend weren't just connection-related.

Astral Horizon, the kinetic equivalent of Mindbender's Ambition, was up for grabs this week and to get it you just needed 3 wins. Some top teams cleverly decided to not go further than that, resetting their cards every 3 wins so that they would keep their loot pool down in order to farm the shotgun from packages from Saint-14. Effectively, they were token farming, meaning there was a disproportionate representation of top-level players at the early stages of the card.

This ruined the experience for nearly everyone else involved.

#The Map and The Farm

Look, let's talk about Anomaly itself. The map is hard, and a lot of people were saying it's a trash map. I'd argue it's more technical than outright trash, but it's not a great map period.

The map is tailor-made for two things - Hardlight and aping. You could get kills with very little skill involved, just run up to them and shoot them with your shotgun or potshot from afar and let the ricochet rounds do the rest. Given the size of the map as well, it's extremely hard to recover a downed orb if it's not already near teammates. And even then, rushing the orb with numbers advantage usually works because said teammates can't react quick enough to cover off the rush. 

The end result is that Anomaly becomes a map of fine margins, a very technical exercise that can only be navigated by the very best players. It requires above-average decision making, positioning and split-second timing of plays with perfect execution. It's unforgiving as hell and it's stressful to play with people who aren't up to the challenge. It definitely led to tensions between myself and members of my core group of friends at times.

And to make matters worse, all those requirements I just mentioned became prerequisites just for getting 3 wins. 

I already mentioned Astral Horizon and the token farming involved and actively advocated by some of the game's biggest personalities. This to me is the ugly side of PvP shining through - not from the community itself but of the way the system is designed. To blame anyone for the reason things transpired the way they did is incredibly short sighted - after all, when was the last time anyone did the Last Wish raid, specifically the Riven encounter, wholly legitimately?

So, players found a way to farm the shotgun. The players who cared the most about this, i.e. Anyone with an active interest in a kinetic quickdraw shotgun, did the farm. And the overwhelming majority of players entering trials suffered as a result.

The PvP playerbase at large is not suited for technical maps. Anomaly is fine for 6v6 because it's an absolute shitshow and should be treated as such. But it doesn't work for trials, because the majority of players don't know how to play technically. They don't know what it means to thread the eye of the needle or to close down great distances in the blink of an eye. 

Trials devolved into an absolute sweatfest from match number one because of the map, and because of the coveted loot that every clued-in PvP player was lusting after.

#THE LOOT

In Destiny 1, we had this problem with a few maps - Drifter comes to mind. But casuals still played the game mode because the loot was genuinely compelling. You could get armour and weapons from weekly bounties and after games randomly. Flawless got you the chance to get adept weapons, which were primary weapons with elemental damage. These had INSANE utility in PvE as well, so there was incentive for PvE players to go flawless, thus boosting the Trials population. Now in Destiny 2, all we get are shiny pieces of armour. No adept weapons and an RNG token system.

The loot part of the looter-shooter aspect of Destiny 2 has been frustrating since Forsaken. Shadowkeep didn't fix anything aside from giving us energy weapons: the raid and the subsequent seasons have drip-fed us mediocre to average loot. Nothing new has been considered coveted or a must have until this season's Astral Horizon and, I suspect, the Eye of Sol sniper to come shortly.

Which brings me to the larger point - if there's no incentives for the larger Destiny population to play Trials of Osiris, it is dead in the water, and it will go down the same route as Trials of the Nine which led to its removal in the first place.

#SKILL CREEP

I want to talk about something I'm calling ""skill creep"". Skill creep may sound like power creep, but it's quite a lot worse.

Skill creep concerns the skill spectrum and the shifting of the median towards the top end. [If we have a spectrum bar of relative skill](https://imgur.com/py5kLn7), where we put casuals on one end and highly adept players at the other, most of us would fall somewhere in between, with a heavy bias towards the casual end of the spectrum.

If the current iteration of Trials continues, the overwhelming population of players aka the ""casuals"" will feel helpless, overrun and frustrated to the point where they quit, never to return. Suddenly, you've done two things - [you've lost a massive subsection of the population](https://imgur.com/NoM9zeq), and you've now shifted the skill median. [Skill creep](https://imgur.com/ClSVVzs) has now occurred.

The people in the middle, the ""good"" players, are now at the low end of the skill spectrum. They're now under pressure, and all they play are players better than them. They're the new casuals. They quit. [Skill creep occurs again.](https://imgur.com/i7FxPJ6)

Now the great players are the ones on the tail end. In this bracket you're going to find players who are amongst the most visible of the PvP community and considered the eminent voices of the community. These are content creators, streamers or your mate Jack who used to skip school on Friday to play Trials on launch. But now even Jack is frustrated, because he can't compete with the only level of players in the competition pool - the sweaty elites.

Jack's had enough. He calls it quits. [Skill creep has reached its endgame.](https://imgur.com/11suXX8)

Now all you're left with is [a fraction of the initial population](https://imgur.com/x1sz4pF), whose sole mission is to play PvP to the best of their abilities. The players who know every angle, every strategy and are good with every single weapon in the game and don't miss, the players who will take a mile when you give them an inch. PvP is now not fun for even them. It's a job. And that's probably why they keep playing - for the overwhelming abundance of recoveries and paid services that, due to the low nature of the population, they have to collaborate on and throw matches in order for everyone to get a payday. 

Congratulations, you've now killed Trials of Osiris and the integrity of pinnacle PvP.

#THE FUTURE

Look, I'm sorry for being dramatic and I'm not a game developer, i don't know how to fix this and I'm not going to provide solutions. This is not my forte. Analysis is what I'm most capable of.

And I think in many ways, Anomaly was a blessing in disguise. Without such a perfect storm of a terrible map, the shotgun and the Destiny community jumping on the loot farming technique, the issues with Trials of Osiris would have laid dormant for weeks or even months. This week exposed the bad with the game mode in one overwhelming fell swoop.

To dmg, Cozmo and Deej, if you stumble across this post/video I hope you send this along to the people who need to see this. I said this week could be a blessing in disguise, but only if these issues are addressed and acknowledged in a timely fashion. I may be just one voice, but please look around and take it all in - there's hundreds if not thousands of comments on reddit, twitter and your own forums saying exactly the same things as I did.

I hope something can be done for the April 2020 patch, but I understand the nature of game development is tricky, especially in the precarious time we're living in.

One solution I have seen floated around, in particular by TrueVanguard and LogPowerslave of the Destiny Down Under Podcast, is that the token system should be changed so you receive more tokens per win. That would be a good start in my eyes, but it might not be enough.

Please address this, we love trials and we want it to stay this time. It's up to you. 

Thank you for reading.

**tl;dr**:

- problems with loot + token system will have top teams farming for tokens after going flawless
- this creates a hostile experience for casual players who are running into a disproportionate amount of high-level players at early stages of their card
- this will create the problem of skill creep, whereby players at the tail end of the skill spectrum will quit progressively until only the sweats are left
- the end result is that ToO will become the wasteland of recovs and paid services that led to T9's removal in the first place.",1022,1585254960,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpj4nt/trials_is_only_going_to_get_worse/,DestinyTheGame,13

I just played four games where a person left after they died. I'm certain that we could have won at least two of those. 

I know that this has been brought up before, but I think it needs attention again. Too many people are willing to leave over a bad game they had, and obviously the cost-benefit analysis over leaving games most people have is that the amount of points you lose is less than having to deal with playing people above your skill.

The points lost should be made greater for leaving competitive matches. Leaving the first time should enact a 24 hour cooldown on playing competitive matches, the second a 48 hour cooldown, and the third a 72 cooldown, with the fourth time prompting Bungie to enact administrative action on the account.

------------------------------------



**Introduction/TL;DR** 


*Jump to Analysis if you just want to see the analysis.* I'm usually the one watching videos on the latest meta, but due to having to be at home I decided to do some testing of my own. For those who just want a simple thread they read and react to, those two weapons above. There you have it. I won't patronize you, you're all pretty damn in the know and can probably guess how this will work. I thought the same thing, and then I tested them.

I tested them, and then I realized how much has changed. I realized Xenophage is killing it, especially for LFG groups looking for fail-proof strategies. I'm an LFG guy, every raid I've ever done has been with a different LFG group. Every week. All 3 characters most of the time. 100s of raid completions. You could ask me quite a bit about my experience with LFG, and at the end of the day I'm going to tell you it's worth it, but that's another conversation. I say that to let you know I don't have a group of people willing to jump in and be combat dummies, or sit around to help me proc firing-line. Luckily, math isn't hard and on the theoretical front this is pretty straight forward. 

-----------------------------------

**Methodology:** 

As said above I don't have groups to test these things out. I do however have the BD-DPS-SE, Best Damn DPS Spreadsheet Ever, thanks to IAMADragonAMAA, et al. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fjrmf1/the_pve_dpsdamage_spreadsheet_has_been_updated/


I used these numbers basically for all of my theoretical testing. The only actual testing I needed to do was to see what synergy those weapons had with auto-loading holster. To do this, in theory, you want to pair the weapon options with weapons that have high alpha damage, like Izanagi's. You shoot the heavy weapon, switch to izinagi's which is already prepped with honed edge x4 and shoot, then switch back to the heavy which would have proc'ed auto-reload holster. The problem comes from that not happening perfectly. But here is an option that still works, and it still melts:

1. Empty heavy magazine

2. Switch to Izinagi's and fire

3. Reload Izanagi's

4. Switch to heavy and empty magazine

5. Switch to izinagi's and fire

This DPS phase takes 13.5 seconds with the Interference VI, which fits perfectly with the GoS final boss damage phase of 14 seconds, especially considering we're not perfect robots and we lose a little time aiming and being human in general.

The Interference VI with back-up mag holds 7 rounds. Now, before you tell me to use boss-spec, I tested it and you do much more damage with the extra 4 shots, since you're emptying 2 magazines. Datto also states to do this nowadays with this archetype of GL, believe him if you don't want to believe me. For those wanting the actual number comparisons, go to the analysis section. 

For the SS Saw, things were less favorable, I'll say that right off the bat. The entire DPS phase, following the exact same steps, which i found to be the best for maximizing DPS, took 19.8 seconds. This is much longer than the GoS boss phase, but it is suited for other longer DPS phases, and provides additional utility, like being able to kill the cyclopes in GoS in an easy and forgivable way. Remember, I run with all LFG groups, easy and forgiveable is the name of the game.. I also out DPSed people running Whisper and Xeno with this combo somehow, though again with LFG groups lots of folks just don't get it. Which is okay, part of the LFG experience I say. 

For the SS Saw, in order to keep the DPS phase under 14 seconds when I tried this in raids, I unloaded the Saw, shot Izi, reloaded Izi, shot izi, then switched back to the SAW and unloaded whatever I could before the damage phase ended. Doing it this way I averaged the most amount of total shots and damage done, shooting on average 13 bullets of the Saw the second time around before the boss quit taking damage.

A final thing to note, damage values differ based on a number of things, x2 crits for no reason on some bosses, matching shields on lower level enemies, the type of enemy in general...for my testing, as stated, I used the DPS chart, and supplemented that with actual raid runs with LFG. which while not consistent with everyone else's methods, is consistent within itself for the purposes of comparison. 


-----------------------------------


**Analysis**

This is base damage only including what the weapons do, not including buffs or debuffs from any source. 


**Interference VI:**

17,735 damage per shot (full court max distance buff) X 14 total shots = 248,290

Izinagi honed edge X 4 shot x2 total shots = 145,504

Total Damage ever 13.5 seconds = 393,794

DPS in 13.5 seconds = 25,491  

**SS Saw:**

2,206 damage per shot X 84 total shots | +25% Boss Spec Buff | +25% firing line buff = 277,956

Izinagi honed edge X 4 shot x2 total shots = 145,504

Total Damage over 19.8 seconds = 423,460

Total Damage over 14 seconds (GoS dps phase) = 327,481

DPS in 19.8 seconds = 21,386

DPS in 14 seconds = 23,391

**Xenophage:** 

Damage per shot = (13,698 - 14,454) (I got 13,698, Datto is getting 14,454)

Total Damage over 14 seconds using Actium War Rig = (383,544 - 404,712)


---------------------------------------------------------



**Conclusions**


From these tests, which take a lot longer than I anticipated, props to all those youtubers honestly, you can see that the GL god-roll combo used in conjunction with Izanagi's out DPS xenophage given perfect accuracy by roughly 2.5% with the numbers I got. With Datto's numbers, basically it's the other way around.. Xeno is out DPSing the combo by 2.7%. As they say in Wisconsin, it's a horse a piece, meaning the difference is negligible. Now, given you need perfect accuracy this may seem like a silly thing to promote. But, if you are a warlock in a party, and you are not given Divinity duty, likely because there's another warlock in your group already using Divinity, this set-up will allow you to keep up or surpass many peoples Xenophage numbers. Why would a warlock be on Divinity duty? Because they have no auto-reloading abilities like Titans and Hunters. Why would 2 people be on a warlock in a given raid? Because it happens, in fact in 4 different raids I ran with LFG groups this week this happened, and in multiple others people switched off of their warlock because they were afraid to bring bad DPS to the table.. Now they might now have to.


I can say from my own anecdotal evidence, I often out DPS folks simply by getting more shots on target. As I've said, we are not perfect, we miss. I'd also like to note that while doing less damage than the Xenophage or GL+Izi combo, the SS Saw puts up high enough numbers to allow for a 2-phase with good groups given everyone's heads are on straight and you get somewhat lucky; and for inexperienced groups, it allows for much better add-clearing abilities. 


I'd also like to note how easy it is to get the interference VI, the SS Saw is slightly harder to come by, I got lucky and the first one I got after reaching lvl 92 was this roll. I have gotten over a dozen Interference VI GLs to drop, and over half of them have Spike+full court with a favorable mid perk like clown cartridge or auto loading holster. On the note of clown-cartridge, it seems nice and has great utility for solo content, but for boss DPS uses, auto-loading holster provides better DPS across the board when used properly.

fpifzz,blaq1ne,Warlock Changes for Crucible Balance and Survivability on Console,"This is a post about balancing the classes. I have and play all three, but my warlock suffers the most in pvp. The main reason below:

-Warlock’s in pvp on console suffer from a number of things that are already known to most of our destiny community. 

-When compared to other classes, last second ways to escape death are what can grant you a win or a loss. (I.e. class abilities.) 

For example, a titan throws up a shield last minute, instantly giving them hard defensive and ways to recover health. 

A hunter dodges, double jumps, and either attacks or retreats to recover health. (Paired with a plethora of exotics that assist them in that dodge. [Im so much better on my hunter for this reason.])

A warlock in mid gunfight, has the slow animation rift that holds you in place. Is it instant defense? No. Titans were made to be tanks. (I looove my titan btw.) 
Is it an instant health boost? No. Even with maxed recovery, the rift animation is too slow, overshield only start to rise slowly after health is recovered, and health is not instant. (i.e. wormhusk crown.) A couple of shots to the head while you’re frozen and you’re dead. 

= “yes but warlock have a charged grenade that heals you called devour.” 

Once we kill our grenade to use devour, we have one less ability to use against our rushing titans and our gotta go fast hunters. 

So here’s a list of changes to make Warlocks Equal in PVP ability wise and class wise. (As well as some known reiterations) 


—VoidWalker—

Devour:
- consume melee energy to proc devour. (It’s not like warlocks need it 🤣) 
- grenade only procs devour on grenade kills. 

—StormCaller—

Chaos Reach:
Speed up movement speed while in super cast mode, and instantly regain health. (Just like Blade Barrage. Don’t know why this isn’t already a thing...) 

Stormtrance:
- Regain health when casting. 
- Landfall has a greater radius when cast in the air but with reduced damage. (It’s a hit or miss, in most cases a miss. ) 

Arc Web: Still disappears if you die while casting.
Fix it. 

Storm Grenade:
- Speed up the thunder speed by a small amount and it might be useful.
- Either that or allow enhanced chain damage to those caught inside. 
I’m guessing it was designed to be a extreme damage grenade for those caught in it? 
No is is caught. Ever. Unless their dumb. Lol. 

—Dawnblade—
- Is it me, or does warlork Grenades not have the same burn damage as titans or hunters incendiary grenades. 

Someone test it please. 
If not, wtf. 
Warlocks literally control the sun. 
Give them sun damage. Lol.   

Phoenix Dive:
- takes way too long to proc. Speed up the animation by 5%. 

Hope you like my ideas. Even if you don’t, let’s start the conversation. 
Till then, I’ll be running my hunter and titan through trials like everyone else lol.

fpif8s,shaxxisthecrucible,"If we're going to sunset weapons, Bungie should use collections as our trophy mantle so players can keep their kill trackers and favorite rolls. Allow players to replace the collections version of a weapon with their own masterworked roll.","Just an idea that kind of combines two problems into one solution. 

How is this different from the vault?

Well, in a way, collections would more or less become an extension of the vault. What it would do is give these weapons an organized place to 'retire' and it reduces a player's 'live' inventory. This would keep things more manageable for players who might have a hard time letting go of some items. 

So, the idea would be that if a weapon has been 'sunset' a player can take their weapon and apply it to the collections (must be masterworked). This would replace the collection version of the weapon with your own personal version of it and have it masterworked. And at any time you want to bring it out for some old content, it will be right there available to you. 

Hopefully the UI will account for kill trackers and properly display the item for users. 

I think this is a win-win.",0,1585252662,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpif8s/if_were_going_to_sunset_weapons_bungie_should_use/,DestinyTheGame,2

There are a few weapons that make Seraph Tower events a breeze. If you don't see one of these on the field but have it, do your team a favor and whip it out:

WAVE FRAME GRENADE LAUNCHER
The wave frame special GL from last season, Martyrs Retribution - absolutely wrecks. You can 1-shot a whole dropship of ads (8 acolytes and a pack of thrall), especially with how nicely the hive line up *AND the wave goes under Phalanx shields* and can 1-shot them. They want the G - so give it to 'em. Get one with Demolitionist and your grenade is back instantly. I've never run out of ammo, either, because one round does so much. Thermite grenades work shockingly well here too. 

TRACTOR CANNON
Wanna melt those big yellow bar enemies? Hit 'em with the boop cannon and go to town. If someone has a sword, one boop and a few swings and end their whole career. If your team is paying attention, you'll never need to worry about tanky yellow bars camping the tower.

ANARCHY
If the spherical space-Jesus loves you and has granted Anarchy, put that beast to use. It's superman for this tower defense stuff. Make arc tripwires and end packs of scattering fallen - or pop a couple near the tower to melt ads in that are too close. Pop one on an ally to give them thorns damage as they run around.

fphs0m,UselessWidget,Why should I log in this season if my progress will get wiped out next season?,"Incoming COVID-19 social distancing induced rant. I want to vent because this season finally killed my enjoyment of the game.

I've been struggling finding the desire to log into D2 this season, having reached almost 1000 LL last season. I did a LOT of bounties because I enjoyed just chilling out with my favorite loadouts blowing things up for glimmer, shards, cores, and XP in PvE, Gambit, and Crucible.

My favorite thing last season was chasing god rolls, farming ascendant shards to MW the gear I loved, and building different sets using various mods for all kinds of content (Hive mods for moon stuff, Taken mods for some Menagerie and DC, Leviathan mods).

However, the grind to the hard cap was by far the worst part of the experience. Every pinnacle reward was the same - limited in availability and pure RNG, making it impossible to chase items I needed. These rewards never really felt satisfying either, since 99% of the time it was just infusion fuel. When I got my final 970 piece, I only felt relieved that I no longer had to cross my fingers for the right upgrades in the right slots. I know Bungie said that pinnacles aren't a requirement for endgame content, but that doesn't excuse the experience from feeling like a boring, often frustrating grind.

And this frustration comes back with each season reset. Not only are our light levels from the artifact wiped out, but the light level requirements for endgame content are bumped up without any story-backed explanation. Why are the Cabal in Arms Dealer suddenly 1030 when they used to be 980? Did Zahn start sneaking mass gainer into their breakfast smoothies? The day before Worthy, I was a powerhouse of a Guardian. The next day, I hit like a wet noodle.

The seasonal grind game loop is incredibly unsatisfying. I feel zero desire to level up all my armor, weapons, and artifact knowing that the exact same thing will happen next season. I'd much rather focus on getting the god rolls I want filling my vault with kickass weapons and armor.

fph43t,BC1096,"(Spoilers) So here is what really happened during Rise of Iron, and what ""Felwinter's Lie"" was really about.","**Just like my post about The Lighthouse, this is using datamined info. However, this is even more spoiler filled because this is what the season's ending is about.**

**This stuff will be revealed IN GAME, so if you would rather experience it for yourself, please avoid this post.**

Now that all that is out of the way, after I don't know four years, we finally have some closure on two great mystery's of Destiny. Maybe three.

So let's get to our first subject:

**Felwinter**

For those of you who don't know who this is, or only know him as the guy who's name is on the new warlock helmet, let me give you a ""brief"" synopsis.

He is an Exo, that when rezzed by his Ghost was told his name was Felwinter and basically don't ask questions because people are looking for you and they want to kill you. He only remembers the Deep Stone Crypt when he comes back to life, but nothing more.

Time passes, and he becomes a Warlord. Warlord's were risen (guardians but not what we have now, pre-tower, most of them were not the best people) that controlled vast territories, think Medieval times. He was the only Warlord to hold an entire mountain, this mountain was named Felwinter's Peak (which later becomes Iron Lord HQ). Still very shady, we don't know much.

He then links up with the Iron Lords, becomes Lord Felwinter, and taken the Iron Oath. Main points of his Oath, protect people, don't given Warlords/Risen their final death (killing them and their ghost so they can't come back). He does protect people, but absolutely doesn't give a shit about the second part. He kills Iron Lords, He kills Warlords. He has his own agenda and no one really knows what it is.

Lady Efrideet knows Felwinter breaks his oath all the time, but she doesn't really do anything about it because the people he is killing either broke their oath too, or are just all around pieces of shit. The most relevant example is Citan (who's name is on the new Titan Exotic). Citan walked into Wu Ming (The Drifter) and tried to rob his bar of all the food. Felwinter showed up, killed him. Then they meet later on, and Felwinter just kills him and his ghost and calls it a day.

Eventually, we get to the ""Remembrance"" lore tab Bungie posted, where we find out Felwinter's relationship with everyone's favorite Warlord, Shaxx. Now Shaxx was different, he was a Warlord, but all he cared about was protecting his people. He had a castle, and one of the walls got blown up by a Fallen Walker. Felwinter wanted to take the Castle, but he didn't want to have a full assault because a lot of people would die. So he went to meet Shaxx and broker a deal.

He tried to get Shaxx to join the Iron Lords, Shaxx declined because he also thought the Iron Lords weren't great either. Felwinter challenges Shaxx to a duel. Shaxx literally decapitates Felwinter, and they agree to disagree. Then Felwinter decides to help Shaxx protect his people from an oncoming storm, so he can buy time and earn some respect for Shaxx. Also he keeps challenging Shaxx, and loses everytime, including getting decapitated a second time.

Eventually Shaxx and Saladin are about to have a battle, but Felwinter finally convinces Shaxx to let the Iron Lords help him. He moves his people to Vostok Observatory, right outside of Iron Lord HQ on Felwinter's Peak.

**Why is this important BC?**

Because of what was UNDERNEATH Shaxx's Castle. Which is why Felwinter wanted it. Tunnels, Golden Age tunnels. Rasputin tunnels, that held weapons, armor, resources, and a certain type of material that could be a game changer. SIVA.

We all know what happens with SIVA and the Iron Lords. Or do we?

Do we really even know who Felwinter even is?

**This is where things get spicy, and where the actual genuine spoilers come out**

At the end of Remembrance, Felwinter and Lord Timur are in Fallen territory causing trouble. Timur notes that Felwinter has become obssessed with Warminds, Rasputin, all of that. He played dumb when Timur would ask about specific things, like Seraphs.

Then this happens:

&gt;“Have you ever wondered what it is that calls to you in that void of memory,” Timur breathed, “where the edge of the past infects your present?”

&gt;Felwinter was tense with expectation. He felt the world contracting around him until nothing existed but the sidearm in his hand. He heard his Ghost in his helmet comms, whispering: “Wait.”

&gt;Timur strode recklessly ahead. He expected Felwinter to watch his back, and he did. Watched him walk. Watched his Ghost, too. There were a lot of Fallen out here. Anything could happen to either of them. It would be easy to tell this story back home.

&gt;""Don't jump to conclusions,” his Ghost whispered as they fell behind, but Felwinter heard uncertainty in her voice. He adjusted his grip on the sidearm, lifting his hand a little…

&gt;… and dropped it again as Timur turned around. “It’s an itch you can’t scratch, isn’t it? Well, maybe you can.” 

&gt;Felwinter's expression was blank. His finger twitched on the sidearm.

&gt;“You think I am one of them?” he asked as Timur turned back around to lead the way. “That all Exo are?”

&gt;“Lord Felwinter, I know what you are,” Timur said with a laugh in his voice. Felwinter lifted the sidearm again. An familiar dread coiled in his chest. He saw his future changing. Again. He saw himself running. Again.

&gt;He was so tired of running.

&gt;The sidearm was level with the back of Timur's head.

&gt;Timur had a smile in his voice when he spoke next. “I know what you are,"" he said. ""And you are no Warmind or even one of its puppets.”

&gt;Felwinter’s arm dropped and swung at his side, as if all his energy had gone out of him all at once. It was impossible, but he almost felt lightheaded. His Ghost whispered something again, but he didn’t hear it over his own relief.

&gt;“Come,” Timur said. He walked with the arrogance of a man who didn’t realize he’d brushed shoulders with Death. “You must see this.”

Timur thinks Felwinter is hiding something. Felwinter is clearly hiding something, and is literally about to murder Timur, but Felwinter's Ghost tells him to not jump to conclusions. Felwinter is tired of running, and decides this guy has to die if he does actually know.

Timur, unknown to him that he is about to die, says that he doesn't think Felwinter is a puppet to the Warminds and Rasputin. Felwinter is overcome by overwhelming relief, because he doesn't have to shoot his friend in the back of the head because his secret is out.

**What secret is so important that it means he has to kill literally anyone who could possibly know**

He's obsessed with Warminds, Rasputin, the tech, everything about it. He's an Exo. Rasputin was made by Clovis Bray, Exo's are made by Clovis Bray. This season is about Rasputin, and there's a lot of references to Felwinter.

**What does it all mean BC, spit it out?**

Here comes the revelation to all the questions above:

Ana Bray, in what is presumed to be the Hidden room in the moon bunker that is housing Rasputin's AI core, says all of this:

&gt;I'm picking up a transcript of an old communication order.

&gt;Rasputin sent it out to his subminds.

&gt;He identified a threat in Old Russia.

&gt;It looks like there was a data breach of some kind.

&gt;I don't know what it was, but he threw out a lot of firepower.... Dropped a Warsat right on top of it.

&gt;There's a record here of Rasputin executing an order to deploy assault frames.

&gt;A whole army of them... but the target was a single Exo.

&gt;Why would he need all of this for just one?

&gt;There's a Warmind intelligence transcript associated with this spot. It references SIVA. But it... it doesn't make sense to me.

&gt;From what I knew, the Iron Lords went after SIVA themselves. Felwinter wanted to use it to build up the City.

&gt;And I thought Rasputin reprogrammed SIVA to attack them when they entered the vault.

&gt;But this says he gave SIVA a new directive long before that. He was using it as... bait.

&gt;The Iron Lords didn't go after SIVA on their own... Rasputin led them to it.

&gt;That was... easier than I expected. I didn't open that door, Guardian. Rasputin did.

&gt;I think he wanted us to find all of this.

&gt;[Rasputin speaks]

&gt;He's telling a story.

&gt;In a time of great prosperity (the golden age), a tyrant king (Rasputin) sent his son (Felwinter) to live among the people and learn their ways.

&gt;He did so for many years, until a great calamity befell the kingdom (the collapse).

&gt;In the aftermath, the tyrant's son was changed (revived as a Guardian by a Ghost).

&gt;The tyrant's son turned way from his father, and became a warrior (an Iron Lord).

&gt;The tyrant chased his son across fields and mountains and oceans.

&gt;He said, ""If I can't have my son, then no one shall.""

&gt;In the end, the tyrant used his son's love of the people against him.

&gt;He promised him a miraculous technology that could rebuild the kingdom (SIVA).

&gt;When his son came to claim it, he unleashed a plague upon him.

&gt;His son was destroyed.

&gt;And the tyrant looked upon his tyranny and wept.

The SIVA outbreak, wasn't cause by SIVA acting on it's own, or the Fallen discovering it. It was Rasputins own doing, because he lost his own Son to people, and he knew he could not get him back. So out of anger, he planted a trap knowing Felwinter's obsession to learn more about his Father, and his past. Led them into a room with promises of SIVA's abilities to change the world, and slaughtered them.

Saladin doesn't like SIVA or the Warmind because of what happened to his family, his friends. He doesn't know that Rasputin did it on purpose, because he was angry about losing his Son. The Iron Lords were never seen as a threat by Rasputin. Atleast, it wasn't the main reason for killing them.

Felwinter's Lie, the name of an infamous D1 shotgun, was about this. Felwinter probably knew all of this was going to happen, and he was lying about who he really was.

All of this build up led to Rasputin asking for forgiveness, because he regrets what he did. He misses his Son, he knows he fucked up. He is actually trying to redeem himself, to humanity.

Now this leaves us with a few questions, like was Felwinter a Seraph. How does Rasputin have a Son if he's an AI. Exo's used to be humans, but was Felwinter simply created to be a mobile Rasputin? Is Felwinter the manifestation of the cut content from D1 where Rasputin WAS an Exo?

The irony is Rasputin wasn't even made to be the all seeing eye defense system. He was originally just a Golden Age safety AI, converted into a Warmind to control and defend all of human civilization.

SIVA at it's core was never intended to be bad, it really was a game changer. The creators knew it had the potential to do horrible things, and they brought it up to the heads of Clovis Bray, who ignored it, fired them, and continued on. All it took was a simple change in directives for shit to hit the fan.

There are more bits of lore to add to the story.

**Tatarstan**

A conversation between Ana and Rasputin

&gt;""OK, Red. Back it up. These 'Seraphs' you keep referencing—what were they?""

&gt;::They were all things to me. Everything I required.::

&gt;""That… doesn't help. What were these Seraphs for? These files suggest that you built and stored planetary combat platforms for 'seven Seraphs.' I thought the Golden Age was a time of peace.""

&gt;::It was a time of peace.::

&gt;""This is a lot of firepower, Red.""

&gt;::Swords keep peace.::

&gt;""And this armor—even a Guardian wouldn't turn this down.""

&gt;::They protected me. I protected them.::

&gt;""The Seraphs are gone now?""

&gt;::Everything is gone.::

&gt;""So those blades you gave to the Guardians belonged to the Seraphs.""

&gt;::Yes.::

&gt;""You trust them?""

&gt;::Everything is gone.::

**Obsidian Wings**

&gt;Lord Felwinter inserted his hands into the piloting board, and the lights in the ship's cabin bloomed to life.

&gt;""How did you find it?"" he asked his Ghost.

&gt;""I hacked a Rasputin bunker,"" Felspring said, shaking her shell. ""This time along the coast of Varuna.""

&gt;""The drive is fully functional,"" Felwinter noted. ""We can escape orbit with this.""

&gt;""We can get all the way across the system with this,"" Felspring replied.

&gt;The Exo's eyes blazed inside his sleek, black skull. He sat listening to the hum of the ship's mechanics.

&gt;""You've fought this fight a long time,"" Felspring continued. ""We can plot a course around the Warsat network. We'd never have to touch a single planet with a Warmind presence. Any of them.""

&gt;""We've gotten very good at hiding,"" Felwinter said.

&gt;""Yes.""

&gt;""You would leave the Iron Lords to fend for themselves?""

&gt;""Would you?""

&gt;Felwinter released his hold on the piloting board in response, and the ship shuddered and died. The Exo turned his seat around, lowered the landing ramp, and descended, his greatcoat trailing behind him.

&gt;""You've changed,"" Felspring said.

&gt;""So have you,"" Felwinter replied.

There is also ""Absalom Knife"", but I think that is a whole different story. Which the jury is still out on, in my opinion. Short explanation, I and some other people believe in order to save humanity Rasputin killed basically every Human so that the Collapse would end. He called this the ""Abhorrent Imperative"", Abhorrent meaning awful.

Absalom Knife just has the flavor text, ""This is the abhorrent truth: to protect some, we must destroy others.""

Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this thread. I was really happy to see the overwhelming love my post yesterday got. I plan on doing on more regarding Clovis and Ana, and what we learned about them this season.

fpgyy6,i_forget_what_i_do,"Champions, as enemies, aren't fun or engaging. They're examples of terrible scaling and design.","Lets take a look at how Champions function.  In order to do even a modicum of damage to them you need to: alter your loadout to accommodate weapons that you may not have good rolls of, and may not enjoy using, unequip the mod you previously had in place of one to allow you to damage a single Champion type's effect barrier, and micro-manage them in every activity you complete.

Champions themselves have some pretty glaring design flaws that are downright unacceptable for what they're trying to be.  Unstoppable Champions doing just all of the damage, never ceasing to charge you, and being complete bunkers worth of health is not engaging or fun, especially when they completely melt like butter in a microwave the moment you use an Unstoppable effect on them.  They go from being nightmares to defeat to being hardly a challenge thanks to the stun mechanic.  Overload Champions work by taking their current enemy type's abilities and turning them up to 11, spamming abilities while regenerating health if you don't damage them enough.  This becomes a problem when you introduce Overload Captains that constantly go on a teleport tantrum whenever you shoot one bullet into them.  The same can be said for the Overload Minotaur which has a habit of teleporting around to regain its health back.  Lastly we have the Barrier Champion, one of the single most annoying enemy types to fight.  If you don't have an Anti-Barrier weapon on you then there's little you can do against them.  Damage them enough and they go into defensive mode to put up a shield and... regain their health that you took off.  This means that if you're not a fan of the season's current Anti-Barrier mods you're just SOL.  You *might* have Eriana's Vow and you might not depending on when you started playing or started back up playing again.

All of these annoyances compound together with the flat buff to health, damage, and ability spam that all of the enemies receive when turned into a Champion variant.  There are a few stand-out extreme annoyances that I experience when playing.  Barrier Colossi are easily the single most annoying Barrier enemy in the game, sporting insane damage output along with movement and visual suppression abilities.  Overload Captains are the worst for the Fallen, constantly teleporting around and using their Shrapnel launcher to attack you from random angles that you can't predict while fighting to find and damage them a little to stop their health from regenerating.  Unstoppable Ogres are the worst for the Hive.  They get a speed buff for their charge and the eye beam was already devastating on higher-level content, but is now even more destructive for Master and soon Grandmaster content.  The straight scaled buffs that these enemies receive don't make them enjoyable to fight against and it doesn't improve engagement thanks to what I listed previously with the forced loadout switching.  The Champion enemies, especially in high level content suffer from the same problems that Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode suffered from in Borderlands 2 where the game engine and math just couldn't properly handle the scaling of health and damage, forcing players into using weapons and abilities that simply made an enemy actually damageable with the Slag element.  The attacks, health values, and ability spam just *don't* scale well in Destiny.  The goal should be for a player to sit forward and prepare for a fight when they see ""A Champion has appeared"" in the lower left of their screen, not groan in annoyance when it pops up.

The way to fix these issues would be difficult, but I think necessary.  Destiny has always had a problem with enemy variety.  Each enemy faction can be broken down into ranks and each has units similar to each other in each rank.  A Psion is to a Dreg is to a Thrall, and so on.  We haven't received new enemy types since the start of the game or when a new expansion comes out.  I think the goals for Champions should be to rework them into newer, engaging enemy types that aren't the typical Servitor, Captain, Hobgoblin, and Colossus.  We've fought those enemies to death now.  It's time to introduce new, more challenging enemies to face off against.  Instead of fighting a generic Overload Captain, maybe we fight an Archon, an enemy type only seen in a few rare occasions, still utilizing the Overload, Anti-Barrier, and Unstoppable system.  The same can be said for the other factions.  There are tons of options of rare enemies that we hardly ever see or fight against because they've only ever appeared a few times.  At the very least the base goal for Champions should be to offer a new way to challenge the player.  They shouldn't come across a new Champion enemy and think ""Oh it's an Overload Captain.  It will teleport around a lot more because of its ability spam buff.""  When players encounter new Champions we should be challenged to figure out how to defeat it.  We shouldn't already know exactly what to look out for.

This now brings me to the final issue I have with the Champion system and that is the Anti-Champion mods.  They change up from season to season to keep our builds fresh yet that shines a light on the issue of sandbox imbalance. Making Anti-Barrier be a mod only slottable in Scout Rifles and Bows means that in order to complete endgame Pinnacle activities like Master and Grandmaster content you would have to sacrifice an entire weapon slot to a practically worthless effect stick.  We all know that bows and Scout Rifles aren't the primo kings for damage and DPS, so forcing players to equip them only seeks to hobble the player, not actually challenge them.  Seasonal Anti-Champion mods can still be a thing, but we need static, non-exotic methods of Champion suppression.  I think the best way to handle this would be to add Champion suppression abilities to our Supers.  If Champions are made into bigger and badder foes then there would be more of a reason to use a Super on them.  I think each subclass should have their own Champion Suppression effects: Void - Overload, Solar - Unstoppable, and Arc - Anti-Barrier.  This would give compounding effects to the fights, Tethering an Overload Champion to stop them in their tracks, shut down their abilities and increase all damage input towards them.  Launching a Nova Bomb that shuts down the champion and continues to deal damage over time with Vortex or the seekers, etc.  There are many ways that this can greatly benefit the Champion loop and make fighting them a lot more interesting.  It's also important that Exotics be updated to have more Champion suppressing effects so that players that don't already have access to them may acquire them.  Currently the only two Anti-Champion exotics that players can acquire that aren't timed exclusives are Leviathan's Breath and Divinity.  Making more timed exclusive Exotics that have different Champion effects defeats the purpose, so adding the effects to older Exotics would be best as players can then acquire those if they need a Champion effect.

I think Champions are a good foundation to a system that could bring a lot more engagement into Destiny's base gunplay loop, but right now they're just a thorn in our sides that annoy us rather than challenge us.  It's not a fun challenge getting stomped through a wall by a Barrier Colossus and having it kill you from full health because you're on a Master or Grandmaster level activity.  It's not fun peeking out of cover and eating 3 shots from that Colossus and getting turned into swiss cheese because they have a ridiculous scaling damage curve that lets them be so powerful they could shoot through an entire planet if they wanted to.  Champions as a whole need to be better and more engaging.  I think these changes would be a great start to making them more fun to fight.


&gt;Edit: TL;DR: Champions suck, they're boring to fight, they're overpowered in endgame content and they need to be more engaging.  We need more ways of beating them that are static like adding the mod effects to Supers as well as other Exotics that aren't Season exclusive.",5,1585247865,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpgyy6/champions_as_enemies_arent_fun_or_engaging_theyre/,DestinyTheGame,0

What I would like to do is play crucible with my new light friends, or my nephew, or my older brother. But I can't.

All the sweats play Classic Mix because it's CBMM and thus their only chance to not get matched with similarly skilled team match after match. I don't blame them. Every other playlist takes 10+ minutes to find a game and then it's miserable anyway. So, we can't play there.

If we try to play in a SBMM playlist like Control, we face people like me and my friends and family get destroyed. They're miserable and they'd rather play alone. My nephew literally said once, ""I'm going to go play alone. It's more fun for me that way.""

I want to play with my friends. If Destiny is supposed to be an ""awesome action game in an evolving world, that you can play anywhere **with your friends**,"" then matchmaking needs to be tuned.

fpggeb,-GiantSlayer-,Bring back the exotic Kvhostov,"One of my favorite exotics in D1 was the exotic variant of the Kvhostov. Our very first weapon, reforged into something better. Granted, it useless in comparison with all of the other exotics, but the reason I loved it was because of its customization. You could have a scout rifle, pulse rifle, or an auto all in one gun, and you could even change its rate of fire. 

You could imagine my delight as I heard the news that its common variant was obtainable from the New Light mission. And to my surprise, it was a decent auto in crucible even *before* the Worthy AR buff. 

Of course that doesn’t mean there’s no room for improvement. If it was brought into D2 it would have to undergo some tweaks so it wouldnt be as useless as it was in D1, like making the firing mode perks reflect the damage and range of their respective weapon types, and adding lethality perks to its selectable perk pool.

That’s my two cents on the gun. It’s my favorite gun personally (other than Monte Carlo, which DESERVES A GOOD CATALYST BUNGIE).",33,1585246222,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpggeb/bring_back_the_exotic_kvhostov/,DestinyTheGame,4

fpg6ot,kcben01,Bungie can you please fix storm caller upper and lower trees. Please!!!,"In the past 100 + crucible matches that I have complete, i have played as bottom or upper tree  storm caller (busc) and i have noticed something. They are the abosulte worst in regards to all of the other supers. In comparison to almost all other super, the busc is just the worst .
Reasons;
1. Killing potential; unlike most other supers where it pretty much one shoot one kill scenario. With busc, however, you have to stay locked on to your target for upwards of 2 to 5 secounds. And during this time most other players are just pelting you
2. Maneuverability; with most ranging supers, the character gets the addition increase movement speed or is able to move in difficult to track motion, to avoid damage. (To those that will point out golden gunners and hammer titians dont get increased speed or move set, they are able to stay out of most high instant damage weapons. Yes there are sniper.  But they really dont need to worry about apes or other that just fight back because they one shot them.) With busc, you pretty much just travel at running speed (maybe just a bit faster),  and with upper tree you do get blink. But your directions are extremely predictable. In addition, you really cannot hide, since the ult burns so freaking fast. 
3. Health; it seems that when you pop the busc, you dont receive additional resistance. I have been at full health when I ult and have a hunters and titians 2 to 3 hit melee kill me. That's not taking in that I have been deleted multiple time by shoulder charging titians. This is in comparison to other ults were it seems that you get a bit of a resistance buff and are able to eat abit more damage then normal.
4. Super v super; then it comes to a super v super battle, busc almost always loses. I under stand that with single use ult like chaos reach and code of the missile,  they take priority as most time I only see them get 1 or 2 kills at max and you really cannot chase anybody with them. But for other ranging supers, why do they all beat busc every single time! ( yes I have beaten a few other supers, but mostly they were already weak and I got them before they could regen). 

I just want bungie to make the busc just a bit better. Maybe make them be more resistant or have faster mobility. It just seems that busc is weak in comparison to every super . I want to use them as they are fun, but they are pretty much useless in the crucible.",7,1585245393,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpg6ot/bungie_can_you_please_fix_storm_caller_upper_and/,DestinyTheGame,1

Now they have very little purpose for use because they’re basically a Walmart version of 90 RPM’s at this point, can’t shutdown supers, can’t 2 shotkill and they tend to have less range. Any thoughts on this topic?",8,1585243320,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpfigp/do_you_agree_with_the_nerf_to_140_rpm_snipers/,DestinyTheGame,2

fpfhsv,DavidCoultsoft,I think Bungie was (unintentionally) on to something with the Redrix Claymore/Broadsword.,"For those unaware, the Redrix Claymore was the season 3 comp reward for hitting 2100. Now that seems like no big deal, but back in season 3 Comp was HARD and progress was very slow compared to what it is these days. The weapon can no longer be achieved as the Claymore; instead being re-branded as the Broadsword and made much easier to get through generic crucible playtime. Both weapons are the exact same in looks and functionality; only different in name.

Why do I feel like this concept should possibly be revisited?

Because it satisfies two sides to an argument.

Many high-tiered players were left disappointed that the Not Forgotten was basically given to any player with half a penchant for crucible, while many casuals felt as though they were being locked out of a powerful weapon because legend (or even fabled) was an insurmountable climb for the average player.

In the case of the Claymore/Broadsword, something as simple as a name change still gives a sense of accomplishment to the players who were able to earn the weapon in its initial iteration. Hypothetically if we carry this idea over to the Not Forgotten, renaming it the Bot Forgotten before giving it to the community at large, I think that may have been a fair trade. (I'm being facetious but you get my point)

Thoughts on this idea? I think its something Bungie can think about when trying to satisfy two sides of the coin when creating future aspiration driven content.",4,1585243259,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpfhsv/i_think_bungie_was_unintentionally_on_to/,DestinyTheGame,2

fpezow,SaltySpaiden,Can we please allow fireteams of 3 in Rumble again?,"Bungie got rid of this feature mid Year 3 of Destiny 1 and it was honestly kind of a bummer. I loved going into lobbies with two of my friends and trying to play against them along with other strangers. I miss it especially now as I get sick of playing control and sometimes the rotating playlist game modes are terrible (Countdown) or just get boring after a certain amount of time (Scorched). It unfortunately seems like we wont ever see Rift again :( and Rumble is one of the base game modes that is always available

I think the big reason people would disagree with this change would be because people fear that others would team with their friends and make it unfair for the people who were not in a fireteam. My solution to that would be only allow fireteams of 3 to enter into Rumble matches as most activities are already limited to 3 players or 6 players and I feel like having a 4 Guardian fireteam might be a little much since its is over half of the lobby. 

Another reason I could see people say no to fireteam rumble would be that people would farm Crucible Pinnacles/Ritual weapons and exotic quests with fireteam members. I personally dont see this as an issue as most pinnacle weapons will become obsolete when weapon retirement comes around as well ritual weapons are not really hard quests to do. Along with this most people who decide they want to farm pinnacle/ritual weapons do it in game modes like Lockdown or Momentum Control (At least that what I see on LFGs) were matches can go on infinitely or getting kills is really easy. On the topic of exotic quest farming, the only exotics I can think of that require some form of PvP kills are, Last Word, Thorn, and Chaperone (probably forgetting a few) and while having fireteams in Rumble could be used a farm, the PvP parts for those exotic quests for those weapons are extremely short and most people already have those exotics already, so I don't think that it would be that big of an issue.

In conclusion, I think that bringing back fireteams in Rumble would be a good idea. While people could team up or farm kills for weapons, I think that the majority of the community would use the feature to play against their friends and strangers. While private matches do exist, its not always fun to just play against your friends when you could be playing against your friends and 3 other guardians. Hopefully others agree with me on this and give me some of their ideas on how Bungie could bring this back and counter those possible issues",5,1585241663,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpezow/can_we_please_allow_fireteams_of_3_in_rumble_again/,DestinyTheGame,0

fpeutc,Stewbeef12,Bungie I think it's time we had a serious talk about Lord Saladin,"Guys we all love our Iron Grandpa very much. He's got old stories for days and just wants to see the younger generation grow stronger. But his recent behavior is...... Concerning. 


Saladin is no spring chicken, and despite being immortal he is still old. And it's showing. 

When he first returned to the tower after the Red War, it didn't seem weird for him to talk about how his fellow Iron Lords would have handled the Cabal attack..... But it's been 3 years.... And he's still talking about it. Almost like he keeps forgetting he already said it. 


And on the subject of his memory... He seems to be getting more and more forgetful. Remember when he used to have weapons available for purpose with rotating rolls? Remember that amazing Bite of the Fox he once sold? I think when he travels to the tower, he forgets to bring the weapons. It's either he forgets.... Or the discomfort of aging has made him agitated. And that pain is causing him to become cranky. Get to the tower and just throw us 4 bounties. He wants to go home because his back is KILLING him. 


Saladin raised us up as Young Wolves. I think we have a duty to make his older years more comfortable. I think it's time we called Efrideet. I know she's a pacifist but she once oversaw the Iron Banner for a time. I think she would be willing to do it again if she saw Saladin's current state. She can bring back rotating weapon rolls and some new armor. She's young, her mind is still sharp. 


Our Iron Grandpa deserves to spend some quality time at home painting and playing with the Wolves.",34,1585241240,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpeutc/bungie_i_think_its_time_we_had_a_serious_talk/,DestinyTheGame,7

fpdb3o,Bhammer74,"With this new season, there is no FOMO","I started playing Destiny during TTK and I am currently in the top 4% for hours played in D2.  I play PvE but the majority of the time, I play Crucible.

This new battle pass season system is not fun. Grinding senseless bounties from a horrible UI is mind numbing.

Crucible had been fun at times but what always seems to ruin it is overpowered outliers in weapons and armor.  For example OEM, Shards,  Gravitron Lance, Vigilance Wing, Uriels Gift, Erentil, Lunas/NF, and now imo the worst Hard Light.  

Do you even test out crucible before you launch?  Yes HL is fun to spray for a day or two but don't you play and realize how stupid it is? You took one weapon and wiped out hand cannons, sidearms, and pulse rifles.  Then on top of that, you nerf snipers and bring back a shotty with ridiculous range.

Now that you've nerfed HHSN and throwing knives, shoulder charge reigns supreme again.

How can I be killed by the same super twice? I remember in D1 having to wait for a spawn when the map was congested.  Why not wait until the super passes.

The D1 maps that were brought back with the exception or Widows Court and Distant Shore are bad. The new obstacles make the maps not fun.  

Crucible matchmaking....smh.  Don't even need to discuss this.  

IB, the majority of people dislike this activity and only play for the pinnacle gear. Those who do like it are running stacks and steamrolling.  And by the way, it the same gear we already had!

Bungie gets crap for not letting us play the way we want. IB is an example of this. But that's exactly I enjoy it. Without the quests I would use Randy's, Jotunn (don't hate me) every game. In IB I have to figure out which smg works for me. Huckleberry is what I settled on. I saw a ton of Risk Runners too. Oddly, not a single Recluse. IB forces me out of my rut. I try out different weapons, combinations of weapons, loadouts. I enjoy it. 

I enjoy seeing what others are using in IB. I notice which weapons kill me most frequently. Symmetry owned me last season. I haven't been killed a single time by Symmetry this season.

Created as a pair, with [Thorn](http://variate.net/wrkwrkwrk/2019/4/10/thorn), for GuardianCon 2019. Both were awarded as prizes while fundraising for St. Jude at the event. This one came together really quickly, and I was very happy with how the texture and the white color of the weapon came through- that particular part was created with only a little bit of white ink, water, and grey wash applied as the final layer, over a treatment of clear gesso. Overall, it probably only took about 6-8 hours to finish the original. 

Of all the Destiny weapons and armor I’ve painted so far, Lumina and Thorn were practically the easiest to merge with my own painting style. Their natural shapes and gnarly textures go perfectly with the gritty, drippy style that I tend to work in.

Lumina is number 15 in the series, finished in late spring 2019. You can see more details and images on my website, [here](http://variate.net/wrkwrkwrk/2019/6/16/lumina).

fpcron,stfuymfban,Give us a passage card for raid pinnacles. It will let us choose any raid or lair for our weekly raid pinnacle per character. This gives variety. I feel like this is an even better idea than just a rotating weekly raid.,"There should be a passage card for raids. When you have the card, it will let you choose any raid or lair as your weekly raid pinnacle source. This is per character. This gives variety.

Let whatever vendor sell it. It can be purchased on each character. If your titan wants to do Spire of Stars for raid pinnacle then so be it. If your warlock wants to do Scourge of the Past for pinnacles then so be it. It will reset at weekly reset. 

If you choose a year 1 raid or lair, I know that the weapons are year 1 static rolls but the main point is that they are pinnacle drops. You can just infuse them into something you like. 

This will give variety to the raid pinnacles and maybe people won't keep getting 100 energy weapons from Garden of Salvation.

fpco7k,Crusader3456,"No that you can't buy Bright Engrams, can they go back to being a passive way of getting Bright Dust Again?","I'd like to preface this with the bounties should stay. We earn way fewer bright Engrams now than before.  It sucks that you can only earn in 3 specific modes of play that run counter to the new content.  And we know for a fact they can and have implemented a system where an object can break down for either bright dust of legendary shards, looking at you Year 1 Dawning Shaders. But I mean that was the whole reason why it was changed to bounties according to Luke Smith was to prevent buying a ton of Engrams with really money to get the dust.  Don't  believe me? Here is a direct post from them from last summer on the changes:



""Historically, the best way to earn Bright Dust in Destiny 2 has been to buy a bunch of Bright Engrams, shard everything from the engrams, build a giant bankroll of Bright Dust and then spend it when the Warlock Dire Ahamkara helmet shows up the Bright Dust row in the last week of the season. We’re going to change this. 


This Fall we’re changing Bright Dust from a pay- and/or play-to-earn currency to a play-to-earn reward. We’re adding Bright Dust as a reward for completing Vanguard, Crucible, and Gambit bounties. We want all players to earn Dust for playing, not for spending money and destroying a bunch of items in their inventory. After you complete all your bounties for the week, there will be an additional avenue to keep grinding out Bright Dust.""



My biggest gripe with the new system versus the old is that it is no longer passively play whatever you want and earn brightdust. It is play Strikes, Gambit, and Crucible in ways you may not want to to earn brightdust. Bright Engrams no longer fo against Bungie's philosophy given to us. Give us back a passive pure EXP option.

fpcmjp,iMaddLad,Idea for trials,So I know a bunch of people including myself are fed up by all the tryhards in trials preventing casuals from going flawless. My idea is that bungie should make 1 week near the end of every season where anyone with more than 10 flawless runs for that season is banned from playing trials.

fpbwjt,dynamicsearchguy,You can use pikes to block the path enemies travel through during Seraph Tower events,"I remember this trick I shared with this community 2 years ago where you can use pikes to block the path of Vex can travel through during a public event on Nessus because the most enemies in the game don't know how to get around the vehicles ([https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7f0bb1/stupid\_vex\_goblins\_dont\_know\_how\_to\_walk\_around/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/7f0bb1/stupid_vex_goblins_dont_know_how_to_walk_around/)). Well a few weeks ago I noticed that enemies where moving in the same path towards a targeted area like the vex did in the Vex Sacrifice event, so I experimented a bit with pikes again and observed that the same trick works on most enemies (keyword 'MOST').

Here's where I sat those pikes at the EDZ Seraph Tower events [https://imgur.com/a/MFjTmjy](https://imgur.com/a/MFjTmjy)

The first week I tired this method at the EDZ event I noticed it worked pretty well on the Fallen. The second week with the Cabal didn't go as well because unlike the Fallen, they know how to jump over things like say rocks and pikes to get to where they have to go. But on the Fallen it worked pretty well. In the EDZ event there are 4 spawn in areas (the big open area where you land in when you use fast travel, the area in the back with the rocks, the area on top of the hill and the area at the bottom of the hill). With that trick it can allow you to focus in on two areas instead of four at the EDZ event. I haven't tried this yet but I think instead of putting those pikes on top the hill you could put them at the bottom of the hill and right next the big rock that's right there. The enemies at the top of the hill can sorta still fire at you, a path blocked over by the big rock might be more useful because Fallen can't shoot through said rock.

I haven't tried this yet but that trick might be really useful for the Moon Seraph Tower event also. From  what i've seen pike riders don't spawn into area that has the event so you might have to bring them in from other areas. The trick might be even more useful seeing how the Moon event only has three spawn in areas with two of those paths being very narrow. So shoving some pikes in at the top of the hill by the building and back the area in where the caves are could allow a fireteam to concentrate on the foes who spawn in the big open area. Io has no pikes and i'm not sure interceptors will work at the moment.",26,1585230990,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fpbwjt/you_can_use_pikes_to_block_the_path_enemies/,DestinyTheGame,1

fpb8mk,Biscuits-and-Pancake,New Season:Season of the Warden,"Prison of Elders was pretty well liked back in destiny 1, and I am honestly surprised it didn't come back with forsaken. A season dedicated to it would be pretty nice. Heres how it could work:

&amp;#x200B;

Background: Variks the loyal(The Prisons Warden from D1) will come to us asking our help to purge the prison. With the help of some House of Judgment servitors, he has been trying to run the prison since the events of Forsaken. The prison is falling apart however, and he needs our help to try and keep the inmates under control, or they will eventually all escape and be a huge threat to the Last City.

Events: Prison of elders would work similarly to how it worked back in D1. Each day, there would be a new room the would be available, rotating between Vex, Hive, Cabal, and Fallen. Each room would have 3 waves, the first being destroying mines, the second being defusing 2 mines, and the third would be a boss wave. The heroic version of the Prison would rotate each day between enemy type, but would be five waves with a more powerful boss at the end.

Reward System: Varik's servitors would be stationed around the solar system, and we can collect bounties from them daily. Each bounty would involve some objective you could complete in the Prison of Elders that day, and completing it would determine what weapons you could get out of the final loot chest. For example, one bounty might be ""Get 15 precision Vex kills in the Vex room"" and upon completion, you would get a buff that would allow you to get a sniper rifle from the final chest. Each Servitor would have the 3 different weapon bounties each day, and you can select one per day from each Servitor, with them rotating daily. They would all each have 5 daily bounties for the planet they are on too, which would upgrade your level with them. Each level would allow you to take one more weapon bounty each day, with level three being the max.

fpb7wd,GoblinGimp69,Radar should be disabled for Trials,"Taking radar away would make Trials a lot more tense and raise the stakes. Every peek would matter more and rushing through doorways will be riskier but lead to greater payoffs. It's touted as a high-end PVP activity so I think it should have some hardcore element to it.

Also when someone dies you would actually have to pay attention to where your team mate died, or if your team has a mic you would still have to search for the revive instead of the radar blatantly pointing it out. This would also make reviving team mates more challenging and increase tension if you're searching for revives while hiding from the enemy you can't see on the radar.

At the moment revive plays can be pretty predictable and looping around to get that revive isn't fun when the enemy knows precisely which way you're trying to loop back to your teammate. Camping ghosts would be reduced because you would have to actually watch your surroundings and not hard scope someone you just killed.

I've only played like like 5 games of Trials casually ever so this is just my gut feeling, but I like watching high skilled players play trials and I think it would make it more enjoyable playing and watching Trials.

fpb520,DrHershey,How spending bright dust and silver on most of the items feels like a waste.,"As the title indicates. Why I feel that way is because we all know every time a season ends the next season’s engram just re-introduces the previous seasons items as rewards. I hesitate to use my bright dust for two reasons.

1-The cost is too high and not enough effective ways to earn it. 

2-I know eventually a good eververse item will be available as a drop from next season’s engram.

Heck I even don’t feel like using my silver unless I absolutely feel like wanting a particular item. But most of the times the items that have been available so far in bright engrams were things I had bought for bright dust or silver in one of the previous seasons. 

Now I understand not every one of the 3000000 Eververse items of a particular season will be available in the next season’s engram but you can ALMOST predict what emote/sparrow/Ghost Shell they would wanna put in that engram. I can assume there are ways to research online what items are sold the most in each category. That would narrow down the end prediction even more.

You’d get lore information through dialogue and sometimes the dialogue would change from time to time making it even more interesting. In Destiny 2 it just doesn’t have that same feel. The same dialogue over and over again and it’s not even fun gameplay wise because the strike bosses are so easily melted.

It’s sad that the champions you guys placed in strikes are more of a threat than the actual strike boss itself, like what the heck? Buff the strike bosses for crying out loud or something. People remember the names of D1 strike bosses because of how much of an impact they made and how many times we barely manage to beat them.

Upon closer inspection his artifact power level was enabled somehow while obviously nobody else's was. I though it was just a visual glitch but he also appeared red and was harder to kill. Has anyone else noticed this before? I was able to snap a picture of his inventory while in the match that clearly shows the artifact power enabled.

I blanked out his name for obvious reasons. What causes this?

fpa8ec,LeoKuan,This is the best season of Destiny 2 for me,"  I have always been a pvp player, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy pve, I like the puzzle-solving part of it. Things like raids, dungeons, secrets, that's what I play pve for. But things like grinding public events, or playing the seasonal arena over and over again is not how I like to spend my time. I usually only play those activities to keep my pvp gear up to date.
  I've always wanted for Destiny to separate pvp from the pve grind, and I'm glad to see that my wish has finally come true. After the first week of power level boosting, I don't have to grind anymore boring pve content. There's no new good weapons for this season imo, no new mods like powerful friend that greatly impacts pve. I CAN FINALLY JUST PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME. And with the return of trials, this has truly been a dream come true season.
  For the time being, I only log in to play trials, when trials is not around, I don't feel obligated to grind the game in fear of missing out of some new meta weapons or mods. I know this was probably not a design desicion they made, but they have created a great season for people like me, who just want to be left alone and play pvp.

fpa74e,MagicMisterLemon,Banshee-44 should have a weekly rotating selection of Weapon Bounties and Seasonal Mod Slots,"Title.

I despise having to donate 100 weapon parts to get an Engram for a 1/10 chance to get a Good Bone Structure. Last Season made it possible to grind out Black Scorpion-4sr specifically through a legendary bounty, and boy, if it didn't feel great to be able to grind that thing out through means other than turning in 100 weapon parts and watching your postmaster fill up with garbage. Turning in things for an Engram does not feel rewarding or fun or special or like anything at all

If he would offer three or four weekly rotating weapon bounties offering the Foundry stuff, I would check on him weekly to see if I could get a god rolled Uriel's Gift or Good Bone Structure. A bounty system could also make Weapon Telemetries useful in some capacity. Right now they just kind of sit there...

Anyway, another problem I've encountered, and this is something others have complained about as well, is that World Drop Armour cannot obtain Seasonal Mods. The obvious solution would be to make Seasonal Mod Slots something that you can infuse your armour with. Then it wouldn't matter if a piece with great looks, high stat rolls, and a stat spread that you favour can't obtain Season of Dawn mods, because you can just infuse it with the corresponding mod slot and **badabingbadaboom**, now it can. 

Where Mod Slots could be obtained should be determined by their mods. Seasonal Mods could be offered by thematically related Vendors or Banshee-44, while Raid Mod Slots should drop from their corresponding Raids. Perhaps the system behind Gambit Prime armour could be updated too. Having 60 pieces of armour per class, of which 2/3rds look identical, is a bit much. But Gambit needs some tweaking in general, so that should probably be included there

fp9zwc,maxmurdoch,A potential fix for 3rd person peaking in PvP,"**For emotes**

1. Prevent players from cancelling emotes that loop once, and force a minimum number of seconds (3?) for emotes that loop forever. This way, if someone 3 peaks, you have a window to push and kill them during the emote animation. Teams might use this as bait, but a well placed grenade or (in this meta -\_-) some hard light wall bounces will give a team a big upper hand if an enemy 3 peaks. 
2. Only allow emoting if the entire opposing team is dead. This would probably produce a rise in toxicity though.
3. Only allow emoting for the first 3 seconds of a game, or during the pan-down of the camera on the team at the beginning of quickplay, or the pan-out of the teams at the beginning of comp.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rather emotes were disabled in PvP but Bungie seems reluctant to do that.

**For swords**

Unless the sword has ammo, it shouldn't be equippable. When it does, the user can 3 peak. That's a natural perk of a sword. The trade off is... that you have a sword.

&amp;#x200B;

**For abilities**

Do nothing. All class abilities provide a brief window of 3rd person view. This is fine as it uses a class ability with a cool down rather than something that's always usable and cancellable.

fp9wju,MirrnOfficial,A Bad Raid Loot Idea,"Before I begin I would just like to say this idea probably sucks.

Basically, on the weekly reset, you will receive a certain number of “Raid Keys.” You can redeem one of these keys at any chest in any raid encounter to receive a pinnacle drop, regardless of whether or not the raid you’re playing is dropping pinnacle gear. If you do not want to redeem a key at the end of an encounter, simply don’t open the chest. 

This idea requires that raid chests no longer automatically drop loot, and instead gift it to those who open it, similar to how the Menagerie chest works.

I am also well aware of the fact that Last Wish does not contain any chests. To fit the idea, it would just spawn in chests at the end of encounters.

So for instance, let’s say you’re grinding for that god roll Ancient Gospel. Instead of just going off a hope and a prayer to get it the one to three times you run Garden of Salvation per week, you can simply replay the third encounter over and over, redeeming one key every time (still trying to figure out how repeatability would work). 

Another example would be let’s say you want a drop from the final Crown of Sorrow encounter and the 3rd Scourge of the Past encounter. Simply only redeem a key on completion of both encounters.

I understand this system will never be implemented but it’s just a nice thought experiment.",4,1585221974,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp9wju/a_bad_raid_loot_idea/,DestinyTheGame,1
fp9vu6,Douger77,I am losing trust in bungie to balance pvp.,"I have been playing this series for a long time. Since year one D1, and I have fanboyed this game always defending bungie, but I have reached my breaking point. The song and dance is old bungie and I am losing interest in doing it. D1 always felt like it was getting better and better, but D2 just feels like it gets a few good things and a crap ton of bad ones added on top. I dont even want to get into how much of a joke this season feels pve wise, but I am getting fed up with the lack of understanding balance in pvp. I play both pve and pvp but I play pvp way more.

Damage fall off range for primaries is still trash. Instead of saying it is trash I will give fair arguments. Some of my favorite D1 weapons are blind perdition and hawksaw, they would be equivalent to the lightweight frame pulse rifles in D2. Just to make sure I am not crazy, I booted up D1, sat in a 10 minute queue and did a little pvp. I can definitely achieve a 3 burst from much further ranges in D1 than in D2. The weapons felt much better in D1 than in D2 as they had a wider range of perks that could really get the stability super high. Lightweights dont even have a range where they hit 27 a headshot like they did in D1. Every weapon had a range where they hit max damage and it fell off from there. It is nowhere near as steep as it is in D2. You would lose literally one damage per shot on these pulses, and then it would drop to 25 per shot, and so on. The damage fall off range and curve is still not satisfying in D2.

Scavenger perks have no place in pvp. The game is a one shot kill spam simulator because scavengers perks ruin the special ammo economy. The formula for forsaken was nice, you got 2 shots and one per brick. Scavenger perks just make special spam more obnoxious as they essentially double the economy and it gets out of hand fast. Why not just abuse special ammo when I get an extra shot more then I started off with, in fact if it takes me two shots I just break even.

Heavy ammo spawning every round in comp is still there when it shouldn’t be. Heavy ammo spawns in 6v6 is still too much, should only be once a match. 

Ttk forgiveness is still not there for all weapons. Still too many archetypes in the game that require near 100% headshots for optimal ttk. The auto rifle buff was a flop, instead of just giving them ttk forgiveness which is all they needed, the easiest to use weapons now are the most lethal, does that sound familiar lunas howl and not forgotten? 

Instead of subclasses keeping their uniqueness and strengths, everything became a roaming super and the shutdown supers are some how still worse then their D1 versions. One and done supers used to feel good, things like nova bomb, but they were nerfed down in D2 and are just shells of their former glory. Some of the roaming supers are just repetitive aka arc strider is just arc strider no matter which tree you use. Middle tree can block but there is no difference with the staff attacks. Sentinel titan suffers from the same thing, top tree can be ward of dawn, but middle tree just gets a bigger block, and bottom tree just gets an extra shield throw. Plus what is even the point of code of the commander in pve. 

Ability damage is down. Not saying bring back one shot fusions but some abilities had their damage gutted and usefulness just taken away. Hand held super nova was just a noob friendly version of scatter grenades (from when they actually did something). Really dont even get why hhsn was added to the game instead of top tree nova bomb over charge making scatter grenades one hit. Scatter grenades can be outplayed easily. Instead of giving the one and done super a good neutral game you gave it to the roaming super, which is a problem for nearly every class. Why do roaming supers get superb neutral games and the one and done supers get a joke of a neutral game. Ability damage doesn’t need to be sky high but enough to where if I combine them with my primaries, I can add another layer of counter play to special weapons

My pvp experience is lost to special, lost to special, lost to special, lost to special, lost to hardlight ricochet wall spam, lost to special, oh he’s still in his super, lost to special, and finally lost to a primary. Special weapons dont even need a nerf. The lower ability and per shot primary damage just makes trying to outplay them much harder. When a counter to a special is to use a special we have a problem. I will still consider sidearms special even if they do take primary ammo, they kill miles faster than any other primary. 

Sorry for the long rant but geez this special simulator since forsaken is getting old. It’s not that I even find specials broken, I just find it ridiculous primaries are just secondary weapons while your special weapon is your main weapon. Special means special for a reason, you should be using them at the right moment and time, not have a game that rewards you for running around with them non stop.

I still prefer D1 pvp to D2, D2 is no where near as satisfying yet. D2 has added some nice changes to pvp, but it came at the expense of adding some bad as well.  Also does anyone actually prefer this node system over the old system for subclasses?",17,1585221872,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp9vu6/i_am_losing_trust_in_bungie_to_balance_pvp/,DestinyTheGame,1

Seeing dmg04 post about his new loot on Twitter while the community is crying about the most terrible connections in crucible as of date is just infuriating. 

Let's make this clear, the pvp experience is GARBAGE right now. Absolute alpha-product garbage. The amount of laggers is at an all-time high, random disconnects occur now every second match (especially when playing with friends across regions) and the quests are tedious, uninspired and exacerbate my impatience to get out of a playlist as fast as possible.

I then take a trip to my triumphs to check the progress on the flawless title. Not to any surprise, the ""This is the way"" requirement had 0/4 of the necessary maps cleared checked off. To make it worse the second flawless run I did I got the ""safe harbor"" achievement no worries. I'm done getting mad at this game, just please fix this so my time this week is actually rewarded.

fp8fr2,-TwoSixNine-,A case against the current state of 600RPM auto rifles on console,"So I've just gotten back from a few months' break from Destiny and I gotta say this new meta makes no sense. 600RPM autos are too strong on console and either they need to be nerfed, or other primaries need to be buffed. This post is a bit long but I'd appreciate it if you'd take a minute or two to read it and leave some feedback.  

The main problem with Hard Light and 600RPM autos, in general, is that they now have faster base TTKs than any archetype of hand cannon while being the easiest weapons to use. A 0.7 second base TTK on a 600RPM auto and 0.8 second base TTK on a 150RPM hand cannon... what? On console, where it's already hard enough to hit 3 headshots in a row because of bloom, flinch, and a less accurate input method, there is essentially zero reason to use anything but an AR right now unless (like me) you have a strong preference for the hand cannon playstyle. If you're not forcing yourself to peekshoot with Spare Rations in every single engagement, you'd be better off with a Hard Light, and even if you *do* try to abuse peekshooting, chances are you'll get prefired down because these things apparently have 50 round magazines.  

What's even the point of hand cannons anymore? They're supposed to reward precision with the fastest TTKs the game has to offer. Like I said, on console, I don't usually hit a 3-crit anyways and I'm a top 0.5% player... now I can put two headshots into someone and get killed before I can even get a third shot off because the most forgiving weapons in the game outright beat my Thorn. Before the update, my rumble win ratio was close to 90%. Now I'm only winning about 65% of my games. I get stomped by bots because any 600RPM AR can easily outgun any hand cannon at literally any range with the slightest amount of gun skill. ARs are destroying what little skill gap we have left and I see people here embracing it because ""Spare Rations takes no skill,"" or ""hand cannons have been meta for so long, it's time for another primary meta."" Like come on man, SR has only marginally higher aim assist than other weapons in this game and if you miss even one headshot your TTK goes up to 1.2 seconds (God forbid you miss entirely). I don't use Spare Rations but if you think it takes no skill you're flat out wrong.  

Hand cannons were *rightfully* the best. People get stomped by good players using hand cannons and aren't good enough to counter them or pick one up themselves, but they refuse to admit it. Instead, they complain that it takes no skill to make themselves feel better about losing. Thanks to this attitude, we have recoilless, 50 round magazine, no-skill-required, low-risk, high-reward bullet hoses dominating the console crucible. Now that 600RPMs are broken, all of those guys can *finally* counter HC players like me regularly and have subsequently been running me down in rumble, because *now* it takes no effort! Simply equip Hard Light/The Summoner/Suros Regime and profit. My Thorn has wet dreams about being able to kill someone as fast as these things can.  

Unfortunately, most people only like the meta when it's good for *them,* not the game as a whole. People who love this new meta probably weren't doing too well in the last one, and 600RPM ARs like Hard Light have given them an excuse to say ""See? It wasn't my fault I was losing! It was the game's!"" And before you say ""Hey, aren't you complaining right now because this meta isn't good for you? Isn't that hypocritical?""  

**No**. This meta makes no sense for the (console) crucible as a whole. The premise of my argument is that a weapon's dominance should be decided by its difficulty to use. The harder a weapon is to use, the faster its TTK should be for those who can use it well. If hand cannons aren't at the top, then Bungie needs to make them easier to use or make the offending class more difficult to use in compensation. It's not a matter of opinion. It's basic balancing and game design. So long as hand cannons are the hardest to use, you would be *wrong* to say they shouldn't be the best.  

Fact of the matter is, though, that unless they get a major adjustment, hand cannons will *always* be the most skillful weapons to use on console and thus should *always* be the most rewarding. Higher skill players will *always* prefer hand cannons and lower skill players will *always* complain that they're overpowered. In any case, ARs take less skill on console no matter how you look at it, so I guess enjoy the meta while it's fresh, 'cause getting Hard Light rounds rammed down your throat at 600RPM by people less skilled than you is gonna get real old, real fast.",0,1585214088,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp8fr2/a_case_against_the_current_state_of_600rpm_auto/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp8907,ZeroMats,Titans are virtually useless in PVP,I think this game is getting to the point where titans need twilight garrison. Any warlock or hunter with half a brain can easily unengage from a fight where as titan have nothing to disengage. The wall is great but I get melted before I can even get it down. Everyone shits on titans and for good reason. The subclasses only allow for brainless head on aggression which doesn’t work in this current sandbox (shoulder charge on 2 different subclasses). Bungies lack of balance in pvp has made it so its virtually impossible for me to compete on my titan on console unless I sit in the back of the map with hard light and a snipe and tbh I hate that play style. I like to be semi aggressive where I can pop in and out and get some shots in to help my team secure the kill but like I said once I engage there’s no way to unenage if I’m certain I can’t win a gun fight. Warlocks didn’t need a dodge at all but of course they got one so why have titan mains been asking season after season for twilight to come back? Because titans are the only class with out a get out of jail free card. I don’t even care if it’s on an exotics but there is no point to not bring twilight back with the way this game is currently. For a company that “listens” to its community in sorry to say that the last two seasons have been a far cry from what we as a community want. Don’t even get me started on the lack of original content or how bad trials is to play. Ball after ball bungie had dropped and they don’t seem to care one bit except for keeping the micro transaction store stocked weekly with funny enough ORIGINAL content.,30,1585213064,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp8907/titans_are_virtually_useless_in_pvp/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp85wy,KvngCra,Armor 2.0,"So I finally decided to take a look at all my armor and get some things figured out and realized just how abysmal this entire armor system is. When not just make it so all armor, excluding year 1 armor, I’d able to equip all seasonal mods. You really have to have 3-4 sets of armor for no reason. I should only need two. One for PvP and one for PvE. If you need a 3rd or 4th then it’d have to been for multiple builds, but for simple players like myself, who use a Lucky Raspberry build in PvE, I only need one set. I switch armor and I’m good to go. Bungie, what we meant by make it so all seasonal sets can equip all seasonal mods is exactly what we meant. Not release a new set of seasonal armor and ONLY THAT ARMOR can get those new mods. It’s bad enough upgrading and infusing things is this game takes every resource in your inventory, but it’s not easy for new players who have no guidance or players like myself who don’t get to play a lot, to get our hands on legendary shards or upgrade modules. I’ve never payed much attention to how all of the armor works but now that I am, it infuriates me. Now I see why Aztecross what ranting so much about. It’s like we ask for one thing and get the complete opposite. No one really feels like sitting down and grinding the Ordeal 24/7 for a new set of armor that’ll last us 90 days. By the time most of us finish getting the resources and armor we need for all the activities, we have 30 days left in the season. This is ridiculous. 

Another thing I wanna bring up is star distribution on legendary armor. I have War Mantis gauntlets with a 71 star total. I struggle to get legendary armor with a high 50 or low 60. That shouldn’t even be possible. And please, can we have an option to refund the stat points on armor and redistribute it ourselves. I should be able to take the 72 star points I have on my Gemini Jesters and put them where I please. There’s too much RNG to this armor system and it inhibits players from being able to participate in activities. It’s not a grind at this point. It’s just annoying and boring.

fp78wn,Ammboz,Why I am not happy with Shadowkeep and the seasons,"First of a bit of perspetive, Iam a 48 yo german who plays way to much games, watches too much netflix and doess too little excercise for his own good during his free time from work.

I bought my PS4 because of destiny 1, Im loved this game since day one. Sure there where ups and downs, as every game with a long lifecycle has, but currently Iam a bit unenthusiastic and sad because the game is not as I hoped it to become after, imo, glorious Forsaken content. And its not because of the repetiative grind, the try hard from bungie to find balance between both THE Hardcore and ze casualZ or the PvEs and the PvPs and all that stuff. Its because a lack of a greater story arc for so long now.

I endured Destiny 2, tried to slosh through the cesspool that was osiris and slowly climbed back through mars to the forsaken expansion and rejoiced in it. It was imo wonderfull, you had a full storyline with another storyline opening up week after week AFTER you completed the OG content! For a few months every week there was something new to do, it was awesome (at least in my memory) and so I hoped for shadowkeep to be a chip of the same block!

Alas it was not. I thought that shadowkeep would explore the storyline after you played through the meagre story quite speadily over the course of several months, releasing new content during the seasons with a new storyquest or an activity that furthers the shadowkeep storyline as the main Storyline that was culminating in the arrival of the Darkness some year or two later. all the while the seasons where means to both give us additional content and slightly progress that main storyline, like seasons beeing big sidequestlines all the while the greater storyarc would enfold acros the time of those seasons.

As it turns out, it is quite differntly. We get small repetative content with a few missions here and there that hint at possible great stuff hapening, but it allways seem to be happening juuuuust out of reach.

And this coupled with the absolute lack of further shadowkeep content really annoys me.

I played the first seasons vigoriously, even got my first title there. than I started with the st. 14 seasonal content - and simply burned out. I havent touched the - and if Iam hearing correctly - SIVA hinting""new"" content allthough zavala, ana and rasputin really are chars I like (allthough I am sad that the og actress of ana was changed due to ... timeconstraints or some such). And I do not see me gertting into it again, cause, and now after all this time ranting I get back to the point - Iam dissapointed that shadowkeep really wasnt a great story spanning at least a year of content like Forsaken did with the revenge for Cayde and the big dreaming city content.

To every guardian who enjoys the current content, may it stay that way!

For me, I guess I sit the rest of the paid for content out.

fp78u3,al-Malok,How to fix the skill imbalance in trials (Sweats stomping noobs),"Right now there's this sort of dilemma in trials of it being a high-skill pinnacle pvp playlist which makes lower-skill players feel excluded. On one hand, if you make all the sweats fight each other after you go flawless it ruins the experience while if you allow them to continue resetting their cards and stomping noobs you get this flawed awful experience.

The solution? Loot. Always loot. Incentivise players continuing their card even after hitting 7 wins. Right now we even have triumphs for gaining wins after your 7th win but why bother unless there's loot behind it? Bring back the Scarab Emblem. Sure you're going to be going against sweatier players, high stakes. What does that call for? Higher rewards. 

Maybe reward 6 tokens instead of the usual 3 for wins after 7.

Maybe an exclusive ghost shell (with actual good perks) which drops at a low chance when getting wins after 7.

Maybe ornaments for our trials weapons which makes them look cooler than they already are.

This way, the lower skilled players would be somewhat unbothered and left to fight each other at the lower win tiers, while the higher skilled players would refrain from resetting their cards in order to earn better loot and at a faster rate.",11,1585207332,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp78u3/how_to_fix_the_skill_imbalance_in_trials_sweats/,DestinyTheGame,1

I just need an outlet to vent. Very frustrating that I got my friends into trials only to have them stomped into oblivion and then left being unable to even turn in their tokens for a drop. Why no bounty drops like in D1? I understand that I could just lfg for a flawless card but let's be honest lfg is a crapshoot and unreliable.

fp7332,chamelion47,I know ppl wont like this but i wanna talk about titans which titan mains wont like what im going to say,"I can go into more detail but ill keep it simple since i started playing d2 in s2 I personally think titans are the most horrible class to go up against in crucible and gambit pvp modes in general and most of you will have seen the crayon memes and they’re pretty accurate as ive never seen any non toxic titan by that i mean....


Uses their knee as a free kill button
Uses their shield bash as a free kill button
Uses their fist as a free kill button 
Uses their hammer swing as a free kill button
(And chases people down with them)

Uses a busted high damage pvp shotgun always
(Cough cough broken mindbenders ambition thanks bungo btw its totally not broken and toxic)

Uses a one eyed mask (always and nothing else) which bungie has REBUFFED

Bungie:
So dev team what now
One eyed mask
What about it
Lets take away the damage buff
Ok and replace it with what
Getting a kill heals you WITH AN OVERSHIELD
Good ideas thats not making it meta again at all

Sits around corners and camps

When using a sniper (rarely as they use shotguns) aims down sights until a kill is achieved so all anyone sees is a massive red glint

Teabags after a kill

Thinks a barricade will prevnt death all the time
For example when ever i see a titan and they put up their barricade to PrEvEnT dYiNg they don’t realise that you can just jump over it and then they proceed to die as i have clapped them this parts less annoying but funny as the barricade doesn’t help them and it just prolongs their death 

But the worst part about barricades
CITANS RAMPARTS
Why bungie its a cool idea but these crayon eating idiots will slam a citan barricade and you cant do anything but run away or die as they can shoot you but you cant shoot them and don’t bother saying ooh just shoot it the hp on the barrier is lowered
Yes let me just stand there and shoot a barricade while the crayon idiot shoots me and i die they’ll think what was that idiot doing standing there trying to shoot me doesn’t he know what a barricade is.
😑😤

Now for grenades i want to make everything so detailed here but you’re already reading an essay i tried to simplify most of this (sorry everyone) ill happily go into more detail if asked.
So grenades i wont bother talking about how all 9 grenades are broken and i hate them so lets choose one


Drumroll please







The magnetic grenade
-magnetises on when close
-explodes twice
-can be buffed to chain react
-is a free kill button
-requires 0 skill
-makes the crayon idiot fell good that they were so skilled when they weren’t
-cant counter (you also cant counter titan melees)

Now supers
Arc-
Fists of spam attacking to get a free AOE kil

The i can fly and insta kill anyone that i touch and kill anyone where i land AND THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AS I CAN FLY AFSTER THAN THEY RUN

Solar-
Spam hammers which explode and explode again

A maul which creates a moving fire blast/shockwave which according to science can go through walls the test results say thanks bungie i love being killed through walls

Void-
Ok team ill throw my shield even though i dont see anyone aaaaaaand theres the free kill because the shield ricocheted off every wall in the map until it homed onto someone

All shield are the same but middle tree can block damage an do more damage when shooting through it that blocks all damage meaning if you see it Just accept death

Ill stop here as i feel like I’ve gone on enough i know titans disliked this but i feel like a lot of people would agree as I’ve spoke to people who agree as bungie needs to nerf thing like one eyed mask and hooray now crouching pings you and maybe lower melee damage so that a fist or knee will lower you to super low health not an instant kill if you’re at full health and possibly reduce mindbenders range for everyones sake as warlocks and hunters use it as well and theres no skill required (cough cough what i call shotgun rushers they see you from 50m away and run straight at you with a shotgun its not like you can shoot them and they die before they reach you) and fix titan grenades do ANYTHING about citans maybe reduce health even more not the timer

Anyway i tried to keep it short but i failed I understand there is a lot of outraged people on this sub and i don’t mind just wanted to hear opinions and maybe bungie notices doubt they’ll care though and for any of you who wants to trash talk my main class its hunter so go ahead😂 i want to hear opinions im not here to say all titans are idiot (although thats what it seems) but i fell that titans are the no skill class for apes who lack brain cells.",69,1585206447,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp7332/i_know_ppl_wont_like_this_but_i_wanna_talk_about/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp6zq2,KantoLegend_,I Enjoy Iron Banner When I Can Play How I Want.,"So I usually play Iron Banner quite a lot every season, lots of exp and light gain to be had, let alone it having some of the coolest armour in the game. 

However, as many people have noted, IB is a bit of a drag to play nowadays. The obvious reason for this is the quest, as most people, including me, hate having to run weapons we're not used to, or just types that aren't running well in the current meta. 

Light level mattering doesn't exactly help either, meaning many are playing with guns they don't like while being at a level disadvantage too. 

This all being said, I've been average/underleveled this week and completed the quest on all 3 characters. Now that I'm at a decent level and can use my ideal loadouts, I've been having a good time with this rewarding activity. 
Just a shame I had to put in 45 games over 3 characters to get to a point were I can compete without stress.

This mode can be fun, and has very cool rewards, but I wish it would focus less on using specific weapons, and at very least, take out the 'final blows' specifier so that the quest was less awful. 

TLDR: Iron Banner is fun when I've had to spend days leveling and grinding the quest, but it needs to change and focus on the gear, and fun. Quest should be less strict so that players can actually have fun during it.",11,1585205987,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp6zq2/i_enjoy_iron_banner_when_i_can_play_how_i_want/,DestinyTheGame,1

Iron Banner has been such an awful experience every time they release a quest for it. You are hiding engrams through a quest that is just god awful to grind through. You make us play SMGs, Fusion Rifles and Bows.. why? Why can't I play the game how I want to, in order to reach a reward. Why am I being forced to use weapons that are just outright horrible to use in this meta, to get access to the IB loot pool.

Why not make ambiguous bounties that require kinetic weapon kills, special weapon kills, or energy weapon kills, etc etc? 
I just don't enjoy the grind EVERY time an IB quest comes out... Is it just me?

Also, I finish this god awful grind on one character, and guess what ... I gotta do it on ALL other of my characters ... It's such a weird structure set up for you to feel bored and repetitive.

fp6ios,NaCl-Incarnate,Bungie has done it again...,"This is an PvP opinion and not a fact, feel free to disagree and communicate your thoughts in the comments.

First we had what was once arguably the most broken exotic in Destiny, the One Eyed Mask.  Now Bungie had the wonderful idea of giving Titans a F\*\*\* you button in the form of Antaeus Wards.  I originally didn't want to make this post because it would bring attention to this exotic and cause all of the Titans to start running it,  however after the small buff it received last patch more and more Titans have began to use this abomination.   Here is a list of reasons why I think Antaeus Wards need a rework, afterwards I will give my thoughts on what the rework could be.  

**Reasons why Antaeus Wards are too strong in the current sandbox**

1. The cooldown is way to short for the effect it provides, this being immunity while sliding, as well as the ability to reflect projectiles (aka 90% of the way to damage other players in PvP)
2. The ability of the boots have no place in a FPS like Destiny 2
3. They make shotgun apes more powerful, being a shotgun ape is already very powerful in casual PvP, having Antaeus Wards will allow you to win every shotgun engagement you get into, and if you don't win immediately after the first shot you should still have the advantage as you are at full HP and they are weakened by your shotgun.
4. They give snipers free peeks and shots into lanes.  Peeking a lane should be risky if you are not 3-peeking,  When you slide out of cover and ads down lane to either get a pick on someone who is hard scoping or to see if someone is there you should be in danger and not have the ability to say F\*\*\* you to any bullets coming your way.
5. The only counter is to disengage and attack when they aren't sliding (jumping, not looking at you, after a slide where they are in the open and faraway from you so you don't eat a shotgun to the face)  \*Now some nades can work against the sliding hooligan including lasting AOE grenades like voidwalls, spike, and solar/vortex (these are on cooldowns way longer than Antaeus Wards)
6. Sliding is such an core part of Destiny 2 PvP that giving Titans a damage nullification on every other slide unfair to classes playing against them that can't use this leg technology.
7. They look wack, gonna be honest not the most fashionably piece of Titan boots that they have in their arsenal.  

**Ways Antaeus Wards could be reworked to make them more balanced and usable**

1. Replace existing perk with new perk related to sliding,  Increased slide distance, increased sprint speed after sliding, as well as improved handling(similar to Ophidian Aspect).
2. Or, Increased slide distance, provide improved shoulder charge (more damage/range), sliding provides improved ability regeneration (Frostees?) Sliding increases sprint speed for a short duration.

There could be many other ways to rework these Exotics, and maybe they don't need a rework at all.  However currently they seem objectively overpowered in PvP playlists as they counter most of the ways to interact with your opponents(bullets)",0,1585203421,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp6ios/bungie_has_done_it_again/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp6hv7,Shmen8980,Why is Borealis still so bad?,"I mean, why? 

The idea is solid. A sniper that can switch to any element type COULD be a great idea. But it has multiple problems. 1, the reload speed to too slow. If I am using void shots and I want to switch to solar, 2, it takes 2 full reloads to switch over. At that point, you could have just used a kinetic weapon and achieved the same affect. (I’m over exaggerating), and 3, it really is not that great for shield damage. Same as any other sniper really. Who uses snipers for damaging shields anyways?

So, heres an idea. Rework borealis to automatically switch element types. How would this be done? Lets say you are currently set to solar bullets and you aim at a shank with arc shields. The gun would automatically switch over to arc shields with no need to even reload. Also, since its a special ammo weapon, would it not make sense for it to deal more elemental shield damage then it does?

The same sort of thing should be done with Hardlight. Although in both cases, it probably shouldn’t be instant. A good 2 seconds of aiming should be good enough. 

The only real balancing issues would be the fact that it would make nightfalls a joke. So maybe unshielded combatants could take less damage?

If this is too complicated then at the very least the animation should be made into the slap animation Cerberus has.",16,1585203294,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp6hv7/why_is_borealis_still_so_bad/,DestinyTheGame,1

**That’s not how trials works.**

Trials is meant to be a pinnacle test of skill. Yes there is the people who have been flawless an ungodly amount of times, we’ve all seen them. But that’s just apart of trials. 

**TRIALS IS NOT MEANT FOR THE CASUAL CROWD**

It makes me mad when people say they couldn’t get to 3 wins. Play better. Learn. Get better at the game. I’m an average player but eventually I got past 3 wins and even went flawless. Trials is for the super great players, the good. And those who say,”THE RICH ONLY GETS RICHER.” Is not a valid argument. This is a **LOOT** game you get  **rewarded** for doing hard activities. If you can’t earn something you don’t deserve it.

Yes, the token system is flawed, but can easily be fixed by adding adept weapons incentivizing flawless.

In trials you are meant to sweat games aren’t meant to be easy. You will lose. Hell you will lose a lot. Trials is and should always be for the best of the best.

fp670y,losingbrain,I Looked at Destiny 2's Reviews and I Noticed Something Odd...,"[A weird spike at the end of November](https://imgur.com/k4vBQYk) of positive reviews that makes up almost a *quarter of the total reviews for Destiny 2 since its release on steam.* 

I tried sorting into reviews from that time, although only 10 were view-able. Although, I did find 2 reviews that seemed slightly fishy: [Exhibit A](https://imgur.com/ZN9KmWU) and [Exhibit B](https://imgur.com/vkW8IHd).

The first example admittedly isn't the most egregious example, although its short from an account without much play time, and it is about the politics of the Activision split.

The second example seems much more damning to me, for a player with only 30 minutes of play time on Steam, they sure seem to have a lot to say about the release on steam/of shadowkeep even though they only played for half of an hour during an almost 2 month period.

I hope I am wrong about this, but it is very strange to me that there was a huge surge of positive reviews on a seemingly random period of time (unless I am forgetting something that day that would immensely boost review numbers?), and it looks like someone was review botting. Who it was beats me, and even though Bungie looks like the biggest culprit, I wouldn't peg them as the type of company who would do this. I don't even see any clear reason to do this as there has only been one time period where there were a lot of negative reviews was the launch day of Shadowkeep, and still there were plenty more positive reviews. Obviously this isn't the most important topic right now, but I hope this gets some attention.",12,1585201687,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp670y/i_looked_at_destiny_2s_reviews_and_i_noticed/,DestinyTheGame,1

I went back to Destiny 1. I’m a nostalgic 🥱 tbh like all of you elitists out there. But I really appreciated the positive changes that have be made in Destiny 2! Like weapon mods!

And now I’m wondering 🤔 if we’re going to see more weapon mods in Destiny 2 that aren’t attached to a Season Pass? And if we can see potentially better take on Artifacts? 🤔

Remembering Rise of Iron (my all time favourite D1 DLC release 😁) and it had Iron Lord Relics! (Or Artifacts? Correct me if I’m wrong 😓) 

So can’t we have a return of something of that sort once year 4 comes around? 🤔

Or perhaps a bow specific mod that grants you radar while aiming down sights? 🤔 Or perhaps something similar to what the Shotgun, Machine gun, and Sword have in gaining super energy upon a kill? 🤔

fp55ss,ImJustStatingFax,Bungie fix your close range hit registeration in this game,"Recently I made a post about Melee hit registeration, but then I discovered thats not just it. By playing more literally almost all Close Range Combat ability is glitched. Melees, shoulder charges, Swords (Yes the ones Bungie wanted to make viable), and EVEN supers.

Literally all of them just whiff and dont do damage at all sometimes. And it is seriously annoying when that costs you Competitive Match or a High Risk High Reward part of the game. Dont believe me? Here are some videos proving it:

Delirium was and still is one of the best room-clearing machine guns in the game, and only got better when Killing Tally wasn't touched in Shadowkeep.  And, of course, Hush.

Yes, it's annoying getting bow kills.  But Hush solves the #1 issue of bows, their rate of fire, without actually breaking the game.  It's powerful in the gamemode and role it was designed for, but can also punch up against majors due to bows having high damage, and is even decent at boss DPS in a pinch.  And, y'know... it's a nightmare in Crucible.  If you get good with Hush, you can be the god-king of corner peeking.  I don't run into many people using it in Crucible, but when I do, they're always top of the lobby.

I don't think that's entirely fair as I'd wager the majority of their responses are limited in what they can and cannot say so it's not surprise that they avoid certain threads like a plague *cough* EVERVERSE *cough* and when they do dip into a negative thread they get downvoted to high hell.

If there's an issue that everybody hates universally but Bungie doesn't want to change it, boss stomps for example, I feel like the CM's just get sent out to take the brunt of the anger and frustration so that the people who actually make these decisions don't have to.

I'm not even sure what my point is here I just wanted to get this out there because while I don't necessarily agree with everything our CM's say or do I don't think it's entirely fair for them to bear the burden of our salt like they do.

In my opinion, Destiny 2 lacks replayabilty. Meaning that sometimes when people are bored with the season content or crucible they have nothing to do. In Destiny 1 sometimes people would goof off and replay  story missions for the fun of it.

All in all, my suggestion is to let us be able to choose what story mission we want to play. Daily heroic missions no longer give any type of reward so the whole playlist is essentially useless.",6,1585188943,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp3cjj/bungie_what_is_the_point_of_daily_heroic_story/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp2my7,Plummyr,The only FOMO I've experienced is from bugs that still haven't been fixed nor been addressed in months. Missing out because it doesn't work is more frustrating than because I didn't have time to play for it.,"Iron banner quest. Couldn't tell you when it's ever worked. Even yesterday and today, I play and make no progress. Weapons that don't count towards completion. Using different types of weapons to finish another weapons step. Would love to turn in my bounties, but the last two iron banner events, I can't get any progress to count, so I just give up. Would love to have a sweet new bow to put into my vault, but the game literally doesn't work on this still.

Izanagi burden. Still don't have it. Still can't open the lockboxes, even after the rework. I've given up on this one to be honest. I've restarted it, still nothing. It's been removed completely from my quest log, started it again, still get stuck at the same part. Sucks getting gatekeeped from raids because I don't have it, because the game keeps gatekeeping me from even getting it.

Taken Sparrow. I've got all the eggs collected. But no Sparrow, still. It's been so long that usually I forget I was supposed to even have it. And that's after it took so long to get the statue for wish ender fixed to even get the bow.

Glad I upgraded Rasputin to collect resources, pretty stoked to get 1 planetary material a day when I can just harvest a single point and get 5x as much. Glad that one got tested before release. 

The only fear of missing out I experience, is when content doesn't work, and then never gets fixed. Or it gets fixed, but it breaks even worse. Or it gets fixed after a season ends. And each season I ask myself ""how was this not discovered before?"". Did no one test the iron banner thing before releasing it? Again? What about this seasons banner quest? I can count on the quest to not work, more than I can for it to work. Did the izanagi quest get accidently taken off the to do list somewhere along the line, months ago? I'd rather you not release something until it works, than release something no matter how much I play, I can't obtain because it's broken. I'm not a no lifer. When I get the chance to participate in a season or expansion, I want to experience it along with my friends. But getting held back because my game gets a bug, not knowing when or if ever it'll get fixed, is worse than missing out because I simply didn't have the time to play.

Tldr: the only things I miss out on are the ones that don't work. Release things fixed, fix them timely, or please, don't release them at all.",2,1585186120,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp2my7/the_only_fomo_ive_experienced_is_from_bugs_that/,DestinyTheGame,1

Thank you for this amazing game. Thank you for the memories that I will always have. The laughs, and kind people helping me along the way. We love this game with a passion, which is why we constantly make posts about ideas. Some of them are constructive, and some of them are toxic. But we can all agree that we love this game, which is why we make those posts. 

We appreciate all you do, especially during these difficult times. Instead of taking a vacation, you guys are working your hardest from home, providing content for us. And from the bottom of my heart, I thank you. Your work ethic definitely needs to be recognized more often. 

Even if you release controversial content and changes, I can say that I still appreciate the work you put in to expand this amazing game. 

Sure there are issues, nothing is perfect. But now you’re listening to the community, and making positive changes to make the game better for us. 

I hope you guys are good in health. Don’t push yourselves too hard.

To the readers:

Let’s show Bungie some appreciation during these times. They are working from home, providing content for us. Now, I know there is controversy behind said content, but just look at it like this:
Bungie is working from home, they are investing money into the game for us, even if it’s not the greatest (according to some). They are still trying to manage the game from home. Communication and recourses are at an all time low because of this. We should give them a “thank you” every now and again.

I'm a casual player who first got into D2 at launch for a short time, then picked it back up with Shadowkeep and have played regularly since (with a few burnouts from Season fatigue here and there).  I also have been lurking on this subreddit since I got back into the game.

Anyways, introductions aside, I had a thought for (per the title) ornaments related to Exotic Armor.  This is just a towerthought at best, and it'll never happen.  But for discussion's sake, why not?

So, (*methods of acquisition aside, as we all know the sentiment on EV*) what would your thoughts be on ornament sets for ""regular"" class armor that were themed after Exotic armor?  Like a helmet, chest piece, gauntlets, and mark (I'm a Titan main) themed after Dunemarchers or Peacekeepers?  Basically a set to match the aesthetics of an Exotic for the remaining gear?",4,1585179026,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp0qg1/a_thought_on_exotic_armor_ornaments/,DestinyTheGame,1
fp0qcq,hstevie,"Working from home is boring, so I came up with a few things that could be more interesting for boss fights","I go to this subreddit everyday seeing people complain about how they love getting stomped 8 miles away trying to use shotguns on bosses, so I thought of a few gameplay changing stuffs to actually let people play the way they want.

Take Valus Thuun for example: he stomps the shit out of you or just straight up one shot you when you are peeking from corner, that sucks. But what if we can break his armor, or stun him with a specific element to a specific spot to prevent him from doing some certain actions like stomping, calling cabals, using his weapon, etc...? Or add some environment interactions to immobilize Valus, like shoot a cabal ship flying over his head so it drops down on him? To be more specific:
- You can use arc to overload a power core nearby, causing an emp explosion and make Valus's firearm unable to use for a few seconds. He then will change to his melee weapon to chase you around without sending you flying face first to a wall (cuz if he trying to kill you with a melee why would he do such a blunder?). When using a melee Valus will move more often and is harder to hit with a sniper, so it's gonna be easier if you use shotguns or even swords for an epic sword fight. Of course snipers are still usable, it's just harder to hit a running cabal with a weak point with the size of a peanut.
- You can use anti-barrier mod to break his leg armor, crippling his movement, making him more vulnerable to long range weapons but still very lethal since he still has his gun. He would then calls out more cabal reinforcements and drones to create an immunity shield around him and you would have to shoot them fast before he recovers and start moving again. For this encounter, it would be safer to use mid to long range weapons to destroy the drones behind covers without exposing yourself too much. 
- Shoot down a cabal ship (I'm not very sure about this one though cuz it seems a little too much). The ship would crashes right on top of him, unfortunately there is another boss on that ship, so you would have to fight a half-health Valus and another boss with lower base health and damage, or a few champions if that makes more sense. 

Here's another one: Hashladun. Basically the boss fight is just shoot everything in the room until the damage phase. Pretty lackluster for a boss fight, but here are my suggestions:At the start of the boss fight, replace 2 wizards guarding the door with 2 wizards creating (or funneling, sorry I'm not very familiar with lores) a void orb. Kill the wizards like normal but the orb is now interactive. As the first immune phase begins, Hashladun calls out 2 more wizards and a bunch of hives. Eliminate them as usual, but if the wizards stay alive after a designated amount of time, they would then go immune and continue funneling the orb, second damage phase starts. The second immune, the wizards have finished their job, the orb becomes a crystal that strengthens Hashladun. She would gained a new skill set, making her harder to kill and more dangerous while also, invulnerable. She would move around more often, creating slow debuffs, shooting tracing arc projectiles more. Your mission is to destroy the crystal while trying to stay alive. After the crystal is destroyed, Hashladun will no longer goes immune anymore and will be stunned for a brief moment, then everything else would go just like the normal strike version; ogres, knights, thralls,... These are your options for the encounter:
- As the first 2 wizards die, take the orb and throw it at Hashladun after she goes immune to break her shield for a few seconds. Then she would make another orb by herself along with the 2nd phase wizards. While they are trying to make the crystal, champions would spawn and protect the wizards. Killing the wizards with the matching shield element will cause the orb to explode and Hashladun would be stunned again. Since there are no more wizards in the 3rd encounter, the strike goes back to normal, Hashladun still has immune shield. For this encounter you would have to deal with more champions and knights.
- Instead of killing the wizards with a matching element, just kill them normally so the orb wont explode. The enemies would start trying to kill you instead of protecting Hashladun and the wizards. Kill the champions, knights and ads then go grab the powered orb and throw it at Hashladun, creating a huge explosion, dealing void damage to its surrounding. If the orb hits Hashladun, she would received damage and no longer be able to go immune, strike goes back to normal. This one doesn't require you to fight head on with the high tier enemies, if you can grab the orb and throw it at Hashladun, the enemies nearby will be killed by the explosion.
*The pros*
- Harder versions of the strikes mean more challenges and triumphs.
- Pinnacle reward for completing a special version of the strike and and also reaching 200k score, so you would have 2 pinnacles from a single run if you are skilled enough.
- Special loot for completing special versions of the strikes (shaders, emblems, weapons, ghost shells, sparrows, ships).
*The cons*
- Take more time to complete.
- Requires high level and good teamwork.
- Harder for solo players.

So those are just a few thoughts of mine. I was working from home and came up with them on the spot so there are probably a lot mistakes, but the main idea is for Bungie to change the way bosses work, so we can play how we want, the way we want, and also making strikes more interesting to play.

fp0bbc,KyroKN,"Sunsetting COULD work great, but some things REALLY need to change to pave its path.","I've been thinking about it quite a lot recently, I've heard people opinions, seen rants and heard different viewpoints, and I think it could work, but Bungie needs to fix their shit.

  
Sunsetting could be horrible. We could lose all our well-earned top tier weapons, we could be forced fed weak rolled weapons, we could be stuck in a game cycle that constantly fights with us to keep us farming for new, uninteresting weapons, and eventually kill our drive to farm for weapons; something Bungie has said they want to do the opposite of.

  
But there are also upsides. Sunsetting could mean Bungie could make a Fatebringer-Black Hammer-Gjallarhorn 2.0, a fantastically fun and busted loadout perfect for just about all PvE activities, eventually being left behind in an old sandbox, leaving a literal legend in its wake. Think, we still talk about Gjallarhorn almost six years after its prime. This is the REAL ""you had to be there moment.""

  
If Bungie wants to make the sunsetting idea work, we can't just keep reskinning and recycling weapons. At some point, we're just farming for the same weapon we had perfect access to seven months ago, this time with, maybe, a new perk. They would need to make a whole new weapon release. This would likely entail a vendor reset, many new armor sets, and weapons (think Taken King). 

This is something I've heard many PvE players ask for, but we need raid weapons to be legitimately interesting weapons. What we have now is just new models with the same perks and similar stats to every other weapon in the game. Look back to Destiny 1. Raid weapons were static rolled, low drop chance (and sometimes) miracle guns. Fatebringer, Praedyth's Timepiece, Black Hammer, legendary weapons that incited more excitement than literally any drop in Destiny 2 currently. Remember how people lost their minds when they FINALLY got that Black Hammer? When they got their Fatebringer? Reactions people might have now for raid exotics are the reactions we used to have for legendary weapons. Bungie can make powerful weapons like these again, without fear that it will permanently shrink the viability of every other gun, they can simply sunset these weapons and create a new set of weapons that give you the drive to go for them.

Pinnacle weapons can come back. Why shouldn't they? Bungie could simply send them to the shadow realm as soon as they become problematic. Recluse has consistently been the no-brain choice for PvE because of its ease of use, if it was sent away and replaced with a new set of pinnacle weapons that are just as, if not more powerful.

Sunsetting isn't inherently evil. But doing it wrong could permanently blight the enjoyment of Destiny 2. It needs to be done right or not done at all.",1,1585177524,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fp0bbc/sunsetting_could_work_great_but_some_things/,DestinyTheGame,1

fp09a8,Kamex45lol,(RANT) Destiny 2 is a recycling fest and the temporary content is very annoying,"The last additions that Bungie brought into Destiny 2 were either brought back from Destiny 1 or from earlier expansions. The current season and the one before gave us temporary features and activities that should have been left in the game. The Seraph Bunkers and the Upgrade system is a pretty cool idea, but I ain't farming for something that is gone for good in a few weeks. The fact that all of that is temporary doesn't motivate me at all. But I digress.

Let's take a look at the newest exotic weapons: Fourth Horseman, recycled. The quest was pretty boring and seemed pretty lazy. 
Tommy's Matchbook, kinda recycled. It's basically Touch of Malice.
Devils Ruin, the quest took me 20 minutes and bungie basically handed it to us, it's not even that good tbh.
Bastion, still haven't completed the quest because it's just stupid grinding without any purpose or Lore behind it and I heard that the weapon is bad. 

Compare these to stuff like Thorn: Yes its recycled from Destiny 1 but the quest and the grinding made sense lorewise and it was pretty challenging. It also took us through almost every section of the game. 


I really hope that the next season will be something new and fresh. I hate the concept of temporary content and I also hope that bungie changes that module. This season was the last one that I got with the collectors edition of shadowkeep, so if next season is full of temporary and super grindy content I will quit destiny until they change their module.

fp08l6,Shmen8980,How to “properly” run the Hardlight meta in your loadouts,"So i’ve been seeing a lot of people who are confused about how people are doing so well with Hardlight, even though they can’t seem to get any kills with it. So I figured I would give some tips to help improve your usage of the weapon! 

1. Get that catalyst. You will probably not notice that much of a change, but the catalyst reduces the recoil a little bit. You can get it from strikes/nightfalls so get grinding

2. You may have noticed that shooting people using hardlight is not causing them to flinch and miss their shots like normal. This is most noticeable when your trying to pop someone using hardlight with a handcannon or scout. This is actually because one of the seasonal mods is enhanced auto rifle flinch resist. If you want to do better with hardlight, equip that mod.

Now, fortunately it is likely that this gun will be nerfed in some way sometime soonish as the infinite range tied together with the auto rifle buff has had some...... unintended consequences.

I miss the game that destiny was going to be. Adventure, explore, fighting for what seemed to be humanity's last stand, victories that made glory righteous, Story. 

I miss the game that gave me friends that lasted years, the game that said we could go to that mountain. Where's the large open worlds? The worlds we currently have serve only loot injected, mind numbing chores.

What happened to Destiny? Was the plan always to be this way? I don't believe that for a second. You can hear it in the music, you can see it in the artwork, and you can feel it in the gameplay. This game was to set the gold standard 10 times over.

Destiny 2 has given me many hours of enjoyment and many hours of depression. My game time is fueled on the belief of the game I saw many years ago.

I believe Destiny Year 1 gave us that feeling. It's called discernment . Humans arent stupid, all of us, any of us can sense that feeling, Hope.

fp01b6,SpiritMoonvale,Weapon/Armor reclaim from collections idea,"So with the discussion about collections not mattering when the weapons we care about can’t be reclaimed due to random rolls, here’s my idea.

With weapons, we could have it be that collections will only show the curated rolls, just as they do now (mostly). When you get the weapon for the first time, unlock its curated roll and you can claim/reclaim it from collections at a tier 1 masterwork. I say this because the bungie roll isn’t always everyone’s god roll. But it does at last supply the person with usually a decent roll of a weapon. If they like it, they can fully masterwork it themselves. 

As for armor, I mean, we already have armor 2.0 with rng perks replaced with selectable mods and now with changeable elements too. So now that only leaves the only random trait being the stats. Just do the same as exotic armor, give it a fixed stat roll and make it claimable. Do the same for the pre 2.0 armor as well so that it’s compatible with 2.0. 

These changes would then also give people the ability to reclaim armor and weapons from previous seasons that may no longer be available to earn again.

fozfn1,VonZant,"Iron Banner Tips, for Solos and Whoever"," Dont know why but I love IB.

Ive played IB solo for the last two seasons and had about 6k kills there per season and made it to Diamond both times. I'm just an average pvper but like IB.  Part of this post is because I want to help people. The other part is because I am tired of losing matches that are winnable.  This is mostly geared toward solo players. I'm on my phone. There will be typos. In no particular order:

These are general tips. There are exceptions to everything. But these help.

Assume your teammates will not play objectives. Assume you must win the game single-handedly.  There are Many people that do not care about winning. Simple truth. 

Dont turn in your pinnacle bounties until you need the extra light. Make sure to do it before reset though. 

You will get mercied. Learn from it. You can beat 6 stacks. Do it.  You can win games even if none of your teammates play objectives. Do it for them. You will lose games where you are way ahead. Pay attention.  You can win games when you are way behind. Make it happen. 

Saladin's ""Now they have complacency"" line is no bullshit.  Dont slack off when you are ahead or you will lose. 

You only need 2 zones to win the game. If you are ahead, stay with 2 and defend them or pressure (but do not capture) the third. If you are way behind or running out of time or way ahead its ok to go for a 3 cap (sometimes).

3 capping can lose you the game even if you are ahead. No matter if you are hunting or hunted, Once ""The Hunt"" has 5 seconds left before it ends, IMMEDIATELY run to the nearest zone and stand on it before the hunt is over. If you don't, and the other team does, they can get their own instant 3 cap.  These kind of swings happen all of the time in IB. It can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.   

If you are defending and getting pushed, throw a duration grenade in the zone before you die. The amount of double and triple kills I get from a lightning grenade I threw just before I died is silly. This will delay their cap and hopefully allow teammates to arrive. 

Do not cap A on Burning Cliffs or B on Burnout unless you are super far ahead and are trying to mercy.  Honestly, not even then. There are other examples of undesirable zones, but those are the most infamous. You can get trapped and farmed and lose easily. 

5 or 6 people standing on a zone to capture it is absolutely useless. If you see 3 people capping or defending a zone - run somewhere else. If you are defending a zone and 3 more teammates walk up, run somewhere else. 

""Somewhere else"" should always be near another zone. Defend yours, pressure or cap theirs. Look at the nameplates on the HUD. If you see 3 friendly names by A, turn around and run to B. If both zones are defended, run to the enemy zone and pressure it. If you see 3 guys capping a zone dont run and stand on it to cap too. Immediately turn around and run to the next zone that needs attention. 

On pressure:  Use the radar.  Float near an enemy zone. Don't have to die foolishly (although I often do) but if you just ping the radar there and get 3-4 people to stay behind and chase you around, then HOPEFULLY your teammates will have an easier time defending or will push to capture a zone. Honestly, this one single thing will win you more games than anything else. WARNING:  If you have decent teammates that can defend, and you do this the whole match, its possible to win but end the game with low kills and/or captures.  You might get hate mail for this. Screw them. You contributed and made their job easier, even though they don't know it. 

Predict. Dont go where the shit is happening if you arent close. You won't make it in time. Go where it isnt happening. Because it will happen there next.  And sometimes you will get a free cap or lay down some grenades or smoke for clutch defense.  

Having 8 captures doesn't mean you helped win, and having 0 doesnt mean you caused your team to lose. Undefended zerg captures can rack you up a bunch, but if you never cap a contested zone or back cap a zone, its not really helpful. Or waiting for your teammate to push and clear a zone and then die alone and then go cap the zone he earned you - that ain't cool.  Again - 3 people at a time on any zone is plenty. And its possible to have 1 or 0 caps but pressure the entire time and contribute. 

At the start of the game, Treasure and Beautiful people and snacks galore all spawn at B. But only at the start of the game. If you stop with all of your teammates at A, you will never see these wonders. I think in my entire career Ive only ever capped the starting zone once or twice, and that was because the rest of my team (much to my delight) ran past it.  On some maps conceding B or not pushing the opposite zone can lose you the game in the first seconds. 

You must be willing to die. The amount of triple caps and comebacks and last second wins that come from standing on a zone in the face of 3 enemies pushing you until you cap it in the second before you die cannot be counted.  Seriously. Sometimes you just gotta eat the grenade. 

If you allow a single titan behind a barrier or Warlock in rift or sneaky Hunter to cap a zone while you are taking 35 meter potshots at him - you deserve to lose. Push him. Often they will back off or get delayed long enough for your teammates to arrive. 

I'm sure there is more, and I'm sure people will disagree with some.

foz6yg,Griffintowers101,"Suggestions to revamp armour and shader previews, as well as cleaning up the emblem and finisher spots in the inventory.","Whenever i look at a piece of gear i don't have in collections, i typically like to look at the full set to see how the armour fits together and what it would possibly go with. Thing is, there's no option to do that unless you already have the full set yourself, which means you'd likely have to search for the full armour set on the internet to see what it looks like, which can end up being even more of a hassle.  


For instance, today, i wanted to look at the CoS armour for the hunter. I can preview every piece individually, but not the full set. I took to Google to find an image of the set, and while yes, i found the set itself, all the images were of the set with a shader on. Not what i was looking for.  


What i suggest is that you can preview each piece of armour individually (how it is now), but inspecting on the bar stating the name to the side of all the armour pieces will display the full set, and it would display the same sort of thing as if you were inspecting a shader.   


I also suggest that when previewing /  inspecting an armour piece / weapon it could show all shaders and allow you to preview them on the full set, or an individual piece. Doing this in the main inspection interface also solves the shader problem, where it could work on the same lines as the mod / ornament system, where you don't have to pull a shader from your collections, they're just all available and you can select which one you'd like to preview/equip. This works the same for transmat effects.  


My third and final suggestion is to add a emote wheel-esque system to emblems and finishers. It works on the same principles as the emote wheel. No more deleting and re-acquiring emblems / finishers, just a place where you can view and favourite / equip them. This is the issue with items that have massive amounts of variations; there's not enough space to have a convenient way to view and equip them all. I wouldn't expect this to work for Ships, Sparrows and Ghost Shells however, due to the fact that each is unique with perks and customisation options such as transmat effects and shaders.  


Feel free to voice your opinion on my suggestions, as they could be improved to suit a larger audience.  


TL;DR: Make full armour sets available to preview in collections, put shaders and transmat effects on the same system as mods/ornaments, make an emote wheel sort of system for emblems and finishers.",0,1585173609,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foz6yg/suggestions_to_revamp_armour_and_shader_previews/,DestinyTheGame,1

foz39h,Mirayuki-Tosakimaru,Consider Making Boxed Breathing the “Burst Damage” Perk (for PvE),"With Firing Line (when in a group) and High Impact Reserves (when solo) on a sniper rifle like Tranquility having so much more damage per second compared to Boxed, the perk feels rather lackluster for making you stay hard scoped for more than a full second to get around a 7% increase in damage per shot.

You could, as some people suggested, revert the nerfs to Boxed, but then we have three similar sustained damage style perks (which IMO would be a bit stale)

I enjoy perks that do something a little bit different, and I think Boxed Breathing is an opportunity to give some diversity to sniper rifle damage perks.

Something akin to the current difference between Izanagi’s and Whisper would be great: where Whisper is good for sustained damage and Izanagi’s is good if you just wanna slap that champion really hard.

-Firing Line for Max DPS when in a group

-High Impact for slightly less DPS when solo

-Box Breathing as the “I really want that Major dead right now” perk

Obviously I don’t want to make the perk so crazy that it makes Izanagi’s obsolete, but I think that having a more consistent major killer (especially in more difficult content) would be nice.

There are two ways we could go about balancing this so it doesn’t just totally outpace the DPS of the other two perks:

-Small Damage Buff: 
Give Boxed a small damage buff and leave the rest of the perk the same

-Eggs in One Basket:
Extend the length of time it takes to proc boxed breathing, but make it worth it by increasing the damage by some larger amount.

I know it seems petty, because it was just a small mistake and the reason why I just thought it was funny at first. After thinking about it some more, they can just as easily write the smallest part of a code wrong without double checking it and it could snowball into a bunch of different issues that affect the game. If they test out new content like they do their spelling before releasing it, it’s no wonder why the new content is always screwed up and seems as if they didn’t try. There was a time when I was pumped for weeks waiting to play all the new content being released and now I spend that same time wondering how many mistakes and problems is the new content going to have.

This seems to be a very minor bug, but also a very unexpected one since the whole function of this exotic originally only triggered with finishers.

Note that I haven't tested it with any of the finisher mods equipped as I generally don't like the idea of giving up my Super energy for anything, but if you do use these mods you might want to double check that they are still triggering when you have Severance Enclosure equipped.

Aside from the bug I've been having a TON of fun running bottom-tree Striker with this exotic.  Public Events and Lost Sectors (even Legendary) I can just run through and punch-bomb everything to death.  It's really a great exotic now, at least when using a subclass that you can always have your melee ability up.",3,1585172227,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foysgs/severance_enclosure_has_a_minor_bug/,DestinyTheGame,1

foyput,KaveKanis,Endgame PVP content (Trials) should NOT require PVE grinding,"Veteran D1 player here whose absolutely favorite aspect of Destiny is Trials of Osiris. However, as a PVP-centric player, I can't help but feel ostracized this season with the power level advantages that exist in Trials of Osiris.  


Before saying that D1 Trials also had power level enabled, I'd remind you that the power level grind in D1 was VASTLY different and MUCH easier to climb/get to max light level. D2 now makes leveling a weekly CHORE that spans over several weeks (for most casual players). As someone who was super pumped to play Trials on the first weekend, I was super bummed by getting absolutely stomped by 1000+ power players who had the time to grind to max level in the 3 days prior to the event. Despite being an above average PVP player, I stood no chance and quickly lost any incentive to keep playing and facing vastly over-leveled teams.  


I am a physician working on over-drive right now and do not have spare time to grind out PVE activities to inch my power level in order to be competitive in Trials. Even if I did, I wouldn't want to since the PVE activities on current offer are the same boring, repetitive activities that have been in place for the past few seasons.  


I enjoy Destiny for its competitive end-game PVP and feel like it's currently locked behind an UNNECESSARILY tedious and repetitive PVE gear grind.   


I urge Bungie to reconsider how it approaches ""grinding"" in hopes of placing less emphasis on grinding repetitive activities to increase power level and placing more emphasis on grinding for gear stats and god rolls.",16,1585171968,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foyput/endgame_pvp_content_trials_should_not_require_pve/,DestinyTheGame,1
foypat,HandsomeOaf,[Crucible] On Metas in General (Console perspective),"I'm gonna be honest, I think auto rifles are a little too strong in PvP right now. Not just hard light, though it's the worst offender. The problem is that it's a continuous stream of damage at a rapid pace, and it is incredibly forgiving to use an auto rifle. You can miss a ton of shots, maybe hit no body shots, but you'll probably start out with body shots and work your way up to the head. 

I want to emphasize the point here, I don't think weapons with so much ease of use should be as strong as they currently are. It feels a lot like Uriel's Gift meta in vanilla D2. Granted, now we're not getting killed across the map by an auto rifle (most of the time). 

I know a lot of people on here really like this meta, and hate hand cannons dominating. And I want to say, it's just a pretty small-minded thought that hand cannons shouldn't be meta, just because as an individual, someone finds them annoying. 

I'm not trying to say that hand cannons SHOULD be meta, they have been way too potent at times in the past. 

What I will say is, the meta shouldn't be auto rifles. I think they should be taken down just a smidge. We were very close to great weapon balance in vanilla D2, though the ttks were too slow across the board. There have always been just a few outliers and other than them, the crucible has been balanced.

We can tell Bungie was worried about making autos OP, which is why it took so long for them to get to this point. I hate to say it, but while they aren't OP, they're pretty potent for a weapon that requires less skill than most other primaries in the game. 

What are your thoughts?


tl;dr I don't think auto rifles should be the meta when it really doesn't take much skill or practice to perform with them. I'd be satisfied if they were just sort of off-meta or something.",14,1585171917,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foypat/crucible_on_metas_in_general_console_perspective/,DestinyTheGame,1

foyn9n,Meatloaf_Hitler,"I, a father of 4, have finally earned my Komodo FR4!","Hello, all! I am so excited and am ready to tell you all about my journey! It all began after a day of work. I was tired, and bored with this season. So, wanting to see something new. After looking at shaxx, I noticed the ""Komdo FR4"" Linear Fusion Rifle. It looked unique, and I loving my Linear Fusion Rifles, Decided to go for it. I had looked at the quest, and to my suprize, I saw it needed headshot kills.

Now, I may like LFR's, but I was not good at going for headshots. I could get maybe 1 a game if I was lucky. That didn't sway me, however, so I called in my friend Trevor (We'll call him Trey, for short) to get the headshots. He was really good at the game, so, I knew he could do it. and after a day, he gave me back my profile. And WOW! He not only got my headshots, but also my comp score as well. In a token of appreciation, I let him bang my wife, He, being a very nice man, said he didn't want to, and had to be somewhere else already.

I thanked him, went to see my kills needed. Thankfully, I only needed 5 more. So after grabbing my arbelest, I was off to classic. I had to be quick, as my wife was gonna be home soon, and that meant her and are daughters would wanna watch TRHWoBH. In my first game, I got an impessive three kills. However, I only had 12 minutes left. So I quickly get into another game.

And here it was, my last chance, my only push, to get that komodo. It was Midtown, and I went left. The first thing I saw was two brave guardians rushing me. BANG! the first shot hit a warlocks chest. BANG! the second hit his legs, securing my first kill. Sadly, the second guardian killed me with his no skill Khvostov. Angered, Panicked, and Ready to finish it. I once again peaked left. Seeing the same guardian that killed me last. I lined up the shot, and BANG!, the shot missed! the guardian, a Crayon eating titan, started shooting me with his Khvostov again. I panicked, and shot off a round, when I heard it. the noise of a defeat. I looked at the feed and sure enough I killed him!!

I left for the Tower immediately, and I could barely contain my excitment! I would have my own Pinnacle Weapon!!!! I landed and went to shaxx. And I got it, I finally got it! The best part was that just as I turned off my system, my wife and kids came home so no-one knew a thing.

I'm so glad I could share my expieriance with you guys! I can't wait to try it Next week!!!!!!!!!!!!!",7,1585171721,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foyn9n/i_a_father_of_4_have_finally_earned_my_komodo_fr4/,DestinyTheGame,1

With each season there seems to be a new exotic or two. In regards to non-quest exotics, can they just drop randomly or be rewarded from Xur after the season is over? Similarly, what about quest exotics?

With the return of the Fourth Horseman, you have to purchase the season pass to even acquire the quest. After the season is over, will it ever be obtainable again? Similarly, with the Devil's Ruin, I completed the quest during the season, but can others who have just started playing ever get the gun?

I already have the exotics from the last two seasons past and I haven't eyed Xur religiously, so I yet to confirm if such random drops or sells were the case.

foxm9s,Ratzkid,Iron Banner &amp; Class Balancing Changes,"Update 2.8.0.2: Iron Banner and Class Balancing

With this week's Weekly Reset, Lord Saladman comes back to the tower with the Iron Banner! Our favorite time of the season is watching gaurdians rage to networking issues, so we decided to make some quick tweaks for this week's iron banner as well as some class adjustments found only in IB.

Due to community feedback, we decided to up the latency on player connections, to better screw over both parties and add a feeling of increased difficulty.

Here are the details:

Enemy Hunters now have the ability to rubber band all over the map, with no cool down.
     - We feel that the Hunter Dodge is not powerfully enough, there fore we added the rubber band ability to all skill trees

Enemy Titans can now shoot through walls.
    - we can all agree sense the One Eyed Mask nerf, that Titans have been underused in PVP

Enemy Warlocks no longer take damage.
    - We decided to bump up the warlocks resistance and health, you must now land 3 consecutive headshots to be able to do damage.
    - Also warlock base recovery is 1,000 now. This should allow shotguns and snipers to be ineffective on warlocks

Spawn points on Vostok have been fixed.
     - With these changes, you will only respawn in a sniper lane every other respawn, instead of Every. Single. Time.

Also the Iron Banner pinnicale bow in now way shape or form is easy to find the quest for, because we hid it. Good luck!

In addition to the above, one random person a game, when using Hard Light will have the ability to shoot 5000RPM for the entire game.

foxdz4,destinyvoidlock,Destiny as a series has added more content to the game at every expansion but has continued to shrink the game every time,"Destiny 1 came out with a ton of content in the first year. Its systems and its narrative were completely lacking.

The taken king came out and invalidated the rest of the game except the new expansion. It fixed so many systems and arguably put Destiny in the best shape the game has ever been for a couple months. It also invalidated the rest of the endgame activities and content. The game was a better game but there was so much less to do. There was one relevant destination. The story was a lot better but much shorter.

What happened in year 3? We got Rise of Iron. It was an even shorter campaign. It invalidated the previous endgame (challenge of elders and kings fall). It added a lot of content but shrank the relevant content, again. This was remedied during age of triumph, right at the EOL of Destiny 1.

Destiny 2 launches. Again, the main problem with it was the systems and storytelling. We can also include the sandbox here. It added a bunch of content throughout the year and was a pretty full game after year 1. 

Forsaken launched and invalidated the previous content in the game. It created two new destinations and overhauled all the systems. It took great steps forward in storytelling as well. It made only one destination relevant and made all the others chores. It did, however, remove the previous raids/raid lairs from the end game. What broke from the pattern here is it came out with a BUNCH of new things to do that added to the endgame where we lost stuff. We got two shorter raids. We got forges. We got the managerie. We got a ton! We even got a brand new core activity, whether the community loves gambit or not! For the first time, it made sense to invalidate the previous year because we had a lot to do by the end.

Finally, Shadowkeep launched. It invalidated all previous endgame content. Forges, managerie, 6 raids/raid lairs, and the dreaming city. It added the moon (which is a much less interesting destination), nightmare hunts and one raid. It gave us shallow seasonal activities, which are a public event at their worst and a managerie-light at best. I would not consider either of them truly ""endgame"" so much as something to do. We will have one more of those. Instead of letting those stack up throughout the year, they disappear when a new one does. Shadowkeep's systems have been improved but we have less relevant things to do than at any other time in destiny 2 history.

Whats the point of this? Its to show how Destiny 2 is currently in the worst of both worlds. We continue to grow the size and scope of the game while continuing to minimize whats useful and relevant to most players. As the game grows, we need to have at least the same amount of things to do, definitely not less.

TL;DR
Every time a new expansion and new narrative gets added to Destiny, the relevant game gets smaller and the actual game continues to grow. Bungie needs to find the size of the game that the community wants and make sure that they don't invalidate too many activities that are otherwise fun and engaging.",1,1585167476,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foxdz4/destiny_as_a_series_has_added_more_content_to_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

Unfortunately, I think there are bows that are better at both. My favorite bow is the Vow. With Rapid Hit and Archers Tempo, It allows me to stand out in the open and fight to the finish against most weapons. It can also spit out arrows like I was trained by the League of Shadows. For starting an engagement and switching weapons, I can put on something like Hush that has Opening Shot or Subtle Calamity.

Point of the Stag shoots slower than the Vow and isn't as good at starting engagements as many other harder hitting bows. The only reason I would use it is for Vorpal Weapon, and pray it kills a super before it kills me.

fowwic,vivereFerrari,"We should have a way to make the returning faction armor RELEVANT by being able to attach mods to it, with a system called MOD CONVERSION","Bungie you made an excellent and very popular decision by bringing the faction armor back! Unfortunately, the news that *sounded* so great when you announced it turned out to be *not* that great once it went live in the game. (That's not the first time this has happened, but that's another topic)

Honestly, what's the use of faction armor returning if it's completely irrelevant? What, we can wear it when we are messing around in strikes or flashpoints? But with regard to the current season endgame how is it relevant? Come on guys, **the whole POINT of this game in this seasonal model we are on is to utilize the** ***current season endgame content*****, whether it's raids, artifact, pinnacle/ritual weapons, etc.** 

The faction armor has been some of the most popular armor in D2's history. Its arguably the best looking armor from Year 1, especially with the various ornaments applied. And, people like the nostalgic idea of the factions from D1, with everyone having their favorite between Dead Orbit and FWC, and New Monarchy being forgotten about, left to plot their coup d'etat against Zavala and the Vanguard. LUL. 

We need a way to make this faction armor relevant. My suggestion, since you guys proabaly will not just add a mod slot, is that you **give us the choice to add a mod slot to it**. 

Call it **Mod Conversion**. We pay a combination of **glimmer, legendary shards, gunsmith materials and enhancement prisms or ascendant shards** to convert the faction armor to a season of our choice. So once converted, it will accept **3 sets of mods just as current armor does**: the season of the armor, the season before and the season after. 

This would provide even further incentive for players to grind in a season where there is not much PVE content, and would give us a reason to collect more prisms and shards (it would be nice to see the cap on those increase to something like 100 and 25 respectively, but again, thats another topic)",1,1585165928,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fowwic/we_should_have_a_way_to_make_the_returning/,DestinyTheGame,1

fowsye,T-Bowl,"Just expressing my everlasting regrets, nothing to see here.","Hi whoever made it beyond that title.


So I've started Destiny a little bit after New light. Around November I think.
Played a bit of Undying season and was not too impressed but a lot of other things were going on since I was just starting the game.


When Dawn came around, I was ready. Got the season pass and slayed that season.
I loved the armor and since I have yet to see one with higher rolled stats, I've started masterworking it because it came to my attention that seasonal mods were being extended to other season.


However during Dawn I did not play around too much with the ""Charged with light"" mechanics.
I got a few mods for it during the season but I did not really try to build something. I started to get into it with the ones I have and it is pretty fun, got enough that I can stack and then spend stacks so the mechanic is flowing. 
But! Here is the regret:


I did not take the protective light mod.


Which is too bad cause I would love to have it right now (cue waterworks)


Anyway, it has come to my attention that:

Seasonal armor will be previous current and next season mods.


So my season of Dawn almost fully masterworked armor will be limited to Undying (don't have any mods) Dawn (the few I have at least are fun and usable) and Worthy.


I haven't bought the season pass and haven't been playing the new season.


Should I get that season pass to get the mods that'll go on my fancy armor ? 


I like the principle of warmind cells but I don't wanna be stuck with only one set of weapons to make it work...


I've got one mod that creates them using Seraph weapons and I have only the weapons from the free part of the season pass.


Anyway, if you made it here it'd be great if you could tell me what you would do down below?

Here's some perspective: I played Shadowkeep through December and then took a couple months off, basically sitting out Season of Dawn completely. I was mostly just a bit burnt out on the game and wanted a break. No big deal. 

Season of the Worthy comes around and I hear trials is coming back, so a couple weeks ago a couple of my buddies and I hopped back in. And it was cool! ""Hey, there's a couple new exotic quests, sweet! Hey, we still never did the dungeon in Shadowkeep, sweet! Hey, auto rifles rule now and I'm having a ton of fun with Suros in crucible, sweet! This Warmind Cell mechanic is interesting, and I heard the shotgun on the season pass is good, sweet!""

\^\^\^ That's basically been my experience coming back to the game after taking a season off. It's been fun. Of course there will always be a ravenous section of the community that will find this approach totally unacceptable, but I am totally happy to spend a chipotle burrito's worth of money every few months to keep up with the game. Destiny is much more ""take it or leave it"" these days, and for people like me who sit somewhere between casual and hardcore, that's working out pretty well.",26,1585164071,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fowc6c/seems_that_a_ton_of_people_are_forgetting_that/,DestinyTheGame,1

fowb2y,BC1096,"(Spoiler) The Lighthouse isn't what it seems, and it's a big deal.","This is a lore post, using some datamined stuff because we have to wait a while for all the pages of the new Trials book to drop.

Now, the first entry is still one I haven't quite figured out. Because of the way it is written. At first I thought to just read what was in brackets, but it still doesn't make much sense.

At face value it is talking about the Lighthouses and the Vex, and Mercury.

Anyway, it starts with Osiris and Sagira having a conversation in/on one of the many lighthouses on Mercury. Osiris finds himself very curious about their construction and purpose.

This is all interrupted when the Osiris fan club shows up. Osiris tells them to leave, they insist, he tells them they could stay at this Lighthouse, they say they want to follow him where he goes. Finally he tells them to research the place, and in turn they would be helping him in his endeavors. They agreed and took up shop.

Osiris is kind of uncomfortable, either because he doesn't like these people, or he is uncomfortable about where they will be. ""Repressing a twinge of discomfort, he looks up to the spire.""

Cue everyone's favorite follower, Brother Vance. He was going to the cults ""church"" in a place somewhere near the Lighthouse (most likely the Lost Sector on Mercury) but could also be literally anywhere else, since there are thousands of these things.

What's important is what happens when he sits down.

He feels different, and he hears something. Whispers. They were coming from a passage somewhere in the room. He heard footsteps coming from there, and he smelt ""ozone"" which...typically isn't a good sign. (Context: When Taken spawn or are present somewhere, as well as the *thing* that attacked the Black Armory place, all smell of ozone, in other words it's not good.)

Out comes two guardians draped in gold. One smelled of warmth (no idea how that works) and the other of ozone. They both came from that passage.

Vance and Sister Faora have a back and forth about the Light and the City, and the Traveler. She says she was given new words from Osiris' ""divination"" and that she knows why they are here. She says that this is where the new Collapse will start. And that their goal is to study and figure out how to use the Light on this planet (or these structures) to defeat them. That they are going to be the saviors of mankind and the Traveler.

Now pay attention:

We then get into Vance's journal. He talks about how Sister Faora really likes him and how he interprets Osiris' texts. That he can see things that others cannot. He ends the entry with something interesting, 

""She has opened my mind to the consideration that my condition is a blessing rather than a curse.""

Vance then talks about what the meat of this story is about. What the Lighthouse is doing, and what it is.

The cabal attack, the two guardians that are with the cult repel the attack. Vance finds himself listening, he hears them pop supers, all the gunfire, but then two distinct and unmistakable noises. Two hums, one smooth and warm, the other sharp and cold.

The Spire creates these noises when Leanna, one of the guardians, gets killed. She gets revived, no issues. He thinks it's a coincidence. But then the other guardian, Eremac, gets killed, and it happens again.

The Spire is making noise, singing, to the death of guardians. Not when the Cabal or unfortunate cult bystanders died, only guardians.

Vance feels the need to know more.

He tells Sister Faora and she agrees to help. She has the Warlocks kill themselves over and over, and Vance stands on top of the Spire listening with a few others. He is the only one who can hear it. And once again, he heard it everytime they died.

I wonder, what is a good way to experiment with a bunch of guardians dying over and over? Oh right, Trials of Osiris. The perfect test. He also comes up with the idea of making them pay for entry, so they can fund their research. He knows they will come in droves for the rewards, so he is basically paying them to kill eachother. A lot.

Vance and a repurposed Red Jack watch a match go down. Over the course of the match the combatants become more and more ruthless. The more aggressive they got, the more noise he heard. To the point where he was listening to a crescendo. The Spire was absolutely loving it.

When a Guardian literally unloads every. single. round into a defeated Hunter, the noise hits a spike. But when the Guardian was done with the body, he then turned the gun to the opponents Ghost. And pulled the trigger. Luckily the person was out of bullets.

Ch3-5ka, who we will refer to ass Cheeks (lol) from now on, who is the Redjack, tells Vance this is fucked and they need to save that Ghost before that person kills it.

Vance couldn't careless and focuses on the match recordings. He analyzes movements, fights, everything.

While this is happening the now crazed Guardian loads one into the chamber, and is about to play russian roulette with the Ghost. Ghost revives the dead Hunter, Hunter pops Golden Gun and kills the lunatic Guardian. 

The Spire then produced a different hum, a very deep one. Vance is brought to the point of smiling at all the noises, he's playing them back in his head. He's so excited to share his discovery with Osiris. 

""I heard the Light bend. The Lighthouse reached out to that Guardian when they died… and their Light reached back. They are harmonious.""

Cheeks was having none of it and was pissed off, 

Cheeks says, ""Anomaly detected. There has been a transmission from the Lighthouse. Uplink time: 0.00019 seconds.""

Vance says it was nothing, Cheeks asks what to do about the match, and Vance says to give it to the team that the lunatic guardian was on. Because the other one revived himself, which is cheating. Ignoring the fact that the other guy literally tried to give the Hunter his/her final death.

Vance then hears sass in Cheeks' tone, and tells it he no longer needs it services.

**Now this is when it gets spicy**

Vance goes to visit Mara. He asks Mara to clear the room, she does. He then says

""I've discovered something quite disturbing, yet wholly revelatory. As you know, we've been running the Trials for some time now. On Mercury there exists a spire, one of many, that we've called the Lighthouse. Inside, a two-toned note resonates whenever Guardian death occurs. It's a strange and almost imperceptible sound, but I hear it as clearly as I hear your voice today. The tone tells me…""

Mara, cuts him off

""…that Guardians have dangerous potential within them.""

Vance is then surprised because she apparently already knew this. 

Then Mara says this,

""We know this truth. We are Awoken. We are balance. Brother Vance, I would advise you to finish up your Trials with a defter hand and to destroy all records of your findings. You've stumbled onto something too grand in scale for your comprehension. Keep this to yourself.""

Destroy everything, tell no one. What Vance found is something HUGE. Vance is a bit confused and down, and asks for clarity. Mara then drops some real shit on him, ""I cannot offer you any clarity. The Universe will reveal all when the time comes. There is, however, something you can do for me.""

And leaves him with a message for Osiris. Doesn't say what. But Osiris and Mara do talk a bit. (read below for what the message is)

Vance ignores her request to stop doing research. He knows he is the only person who can discern these noises, and he now describes the songs, as the ""Music of Death"".

""The music of death. I always make sure to be near, so as not to miss a note. Each one brings a new revelation, answering a question, raising another.""

He tries to be as close as possible to death so he doesn't miss a thing. 

He realizes Cheeks knows too much, and decommissions it. He does this so this knowledge has no loose ends, it just between Him, Mara, Osiris, and the Light and Dark. 

Ghaul attacks the tower, captures the Traveler, and everyone loses their light.

Unfortunately this happened at the exact moment a guardian dies in Trials. However, this is the first final death that he has observed. The Spire responded in a new way.

""The Lighthouse spoke to me, but changed its key. A D-sharp minor, if I'm not mistaken. Previously, I had been presented with only a harmonious two-toned note; the implications, as I made clear to Queen Mara Sov, could not be overlooked. Today, I am presented with a defining note that substantiates my theory and validates everything our founder stood for.""

And then we get the lore reason for why Trials of Osiris was stopped,

""When I speak now, everyone should listen, for I alone hold the truth. As it stands, I have no further use for the Trials and will be discontinuing the tournament indefinitely. I have what I came for. All I need now is council.""

Vance goes to meet with Osiris. To tell him of his discovery. He imagines that Osiris will be very happy and thank Vance for his discovery.

It doesn't go that way. Osiris tells him that his research is...

""dangerous enough to destroy every man, woman, and child in existence. You're meddling with forces outside your grasp,"" Osiris reprimanded. ""I warn you here and now, remove yourself from this Lighthouse. Find a simple life. Start a family. Write music. Leave Mercury and this fool's errand behind.""

Basically Osiris says the same thing Mara said. Stop. Get some help. This is beyond you. Stop.

Vance is basically heart broken. He leaves, Osiris and Sagira talk. Then Vance comes back and tells Osiris that he also had to deliver a message from Mara.

""Plant the Seed.""

Osiris then reacts differently,

""I don't know what she means, but she said you would."" Vance offered, apologetically.

""I believe I do,"" Osiris replied, placing his hand on Vance's still-heaving shoulder. ""Thank you. This is quite useful. Well done.""

Then, we end with this:

&gt;Vance stood in the old Lighthouse, frantically assembling the Infinite Simulacrum: a machine formed from bits of simulation seeds and connective Vex architecture to mimic a pocket forest. Textured notes and schematics derived from Osirian lore guided his hand. He heard stories from passing Guardians of increasingly frequent coronal mass ejections. Vast bursts of charged particles whipped into space and furled around a gravitational monster buried from sight and sense in the roar of the star-wind. Passage to Mercury had become more dangerous for the uninitiated. These unnatural motions were heralds of speculation, and he had read the signs. He knew the prophecies by heart and mind and intention.

&gt;Ruin.

&gt;Something new |and so very old| emerged, brother to a shriveling star: An angular |hungering patient yawning deep| shadow reached across Mercury. Uncounted |known| spires fell under its grasp |with uniform relief|. Dulcet tones brought low under lightless breadth and the weight of dark |salvation| hummed beneath the shadow. Their echoes spilled out |awakened| and flowed over crumbling spires |in conversation|. One singular spec of illumination blinked into being, |an end| seen by none, and then |many| spread as the shadow did. The old Lighthouse |spire's collective| beamed |rose| and flared as shadow overtook it |to meet the underbelly|.

&gt;Vance |the implement| could hear |their inspired voices| weeping, not with tears, but in the |voracious| low |ceremonial| hum he had come to associate with death. He closed his eyes |and saw what was to come|.

&gt;This day had many names.

&gt;None would suffice.


The darkness is closer then you think. 

Now when I read this, I thought it was the end of this story, but it actually isn't. 

The ""Saint's Vocation"" ship has a message from Osiris to Saint-14.

&gt;Saint,

&gt;I regret that we must once again part ways so soon after your return. Knowing you are there to watch over the Trials assuages my concerns and is the only reason I feel comfortable departing on this urgent mission. **I must leave you with a monition, though. Be forewarned, the former custodian of the Lighthouse was delving into dangerous territory. The Lighthouses are not what they seem. They may bring a ruin upon us that we have no answer for.** They may also be innocuous, but you know their architects as well as I. Lean toward caution. I urge a careful eye and ear. Their final intent is not known to me.

&gt;I will return. I look forward to our reunion. Stay vigilant.

&gt;Yours, in time,
&gt;Osiris

Going Flawless might not be a good thing, so don't feel bad about it. We are feeding something that will bring us our demise. Saint knows it, Osiris knows it, Vance knows it, and now we all know it. Got to get those drops though!

So why keep it going? Only time will tell.",543,1585163966,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fowb2y/spoiler_the_lighthouse_isnt_what_it_seems_and_its/,DestinyTheGame,1

fow4bq,JLaH_YT,"When Weapon Retirement happens, we need more independence on how we can customize our guns","Armor 2.0 is honestly very good for allowing customization in our armor but armor is only about 20% of the game. Destiny is about our guns, and we need more customization to make our Guardians be in our play style.

(I’ll use HandCannons for an example) 

If Weapon retirement happens weapons should have:

• Selectable Sights
Every gun should have choosable sights that should each vary in how they look, not like HandCannon sights where two sights are going a red dot and one sight might have different lines on the side

• Selectable barrels
Hand-cannons either have choosable Sights or barrel perks. If we could have both, it would allow Guardians to get better god-rolls, more range, more stability for console, and more handling for PC.

•Magazine Perk selection can stay the same 
...BUT more varying perks or buff the underused perks. When was the last time you felt that you felt Alloy Magazine kick in. Alloy Magazine could work where less than half the bullets in a magazine the faster the reload but if there are more than half of the bullets in a gun, the slower a reload. 

•Column 3 and 4 perks
Buff them, auto-loading holster shouldn’t be able to roll on primary weapons, make perks that people would want to try. Guardians don’t want more damage dealing perks, if anything we want more perks that will try and change our gameplay. No one wants another way to gain damage, people want perks that will change their gameplay. Range Finder was good because it increased everything you would want with range and zoom. Zen Moment is a good perk on Console which is why people see Dynamic Sway Reduction such a good perk now because it’s an alternate to Zen Moment and fits into an auto-rifle playstyle of firing constantly without stopping and why people were very surprised when rapid-hit was on the ‘Sacred Provenance’ of all things.

TLDR:
All guns should be able to customize...
•Sights 
AND
•Barrels
•Magazine perks should get a buff
•Buff some underused perks in (current) Columns 3 &amp; 4",0,1585163327,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fow4bq/when_weapon_retirement_happens_we_need_more/,DestinyTheGame,1

&gt;You gain a bonus to weapon damage \[10%\] against enemies that are near Warmind Cells. *Enemies affected by Power of Rasputin are highlighted, even without aiming with a Seraph weapon.*

&amp;#x200B;

The thing to note is that seeing how the actual mod acts as a buff to weapon damage, this can stack with all Debuffs (Tractor Cannon, Melting Point, Tether, Divinity). Here's a damage breakdown of Power of Rasputin and Tether.

fovjio,WarTornProphet,Players should get compensation in comp points for disconnects during comp.,"There should be some form of compensation in the form of points, or really anything, to make up for players constantly getting disconnected.

I, personally, am scared to launch into comp for this exact reason.

Myself and, I am sure, many other players would have many more points if it weren't for the serious server issues plaguing Destiny this season.

Bungie developers needs to work out some way to differentiate actual disconnects from players leaving or cutting off their internet. Or possibly give players ""X"" amount of times, per season, in which they could leave/disconnect before they actually lose points.

fouohb,MrBlackJaQ,"I think the Season, and Bungie, would benefit from each season having a Free to Play element and a paid element for season pass holders.","I'll first say I love Destiny and I'm more just airing my frustrations for a game I want to love, see thrive, and see become bigger and better each year.  I'm sorry if this comes off as ranty instead of constructive.

A the title suggests, I think the seasonal structure needs a bit of a remodeling to encompass more then it does.  I think the Free to Play players would enjoy a game where each season calls for an additional public activity that only lasts the season but allows you to farm for a portion of the rewards available that season.  The paid portion allows for season pass holders to play a new event/matchmade game mode with the ability to acquire ALL of the seasonal loot in the game.  For this example I'll take the current season.

The Seraph Tower would be the free to play event and play as it is, allowing players to play a public event type activity to gain the loot from the chest at the end.  The first chest would drop seasonal loot, like the armor set and maybe one or two weapons, and the second chest could be an encrypted chest that can only be unlocked by encrypted warmind bits.  In order to get encrypted warmind bits you need to turn a bunch of regular bits intoan encrypted bit but the only way to do that is to have the season pass unlocked.


The paid, matchmade, activity could have been the Rasputin Bunker.  In this activity a team of three breaks into the bunker and clears it out, then hordes of enemies try to come into the bunker to retake it.  Eliminate the targets and kill the final boss that comes in.  This could even have played like Prison of Elders or the Black Armory Forges where you may need to complete small objectives in the bunker in order to continue.  On top of that you can add a, ""Legendary mode"" to make the challenge harder and cut off matchmaking so you need to go in with premade fireteams.

Overall I think the Seasonal Activities needs a free to play aspect for players to get their feet wet in the season, incentivize the F2P players to actually buy the season pass, and for season pass holders to feel like they paid for something that the free to play players didn't get in terms of loot and activities. Add the free and paid seasonal rank up loot and that'll be a cool 10 investment per season.",2,1585158507,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fouohb/i_think_the_season_and_bungie_would_benefit_from/,DestinyTheGame,0

fougl2,thecactusman17,Trials fix that keeps a pinnacle PVP mindset while promoting casual player investment,"I'm a casual player. I had such a bad Trials experience this last weekend (aside from some very respectful, patient, and kind clan and LFG players who were completely awesome despite our failure) that I may quit the game. Not just PVP. The whole game.

That being said, I think I've identified the problems of this mode from a casual perspective, and they're all the result of a terribly structured loot system. The existing system punishes casual players but allows no opportunities to improve their experience within Trials except by consecutive wins to the milestone rewards.  I also encourages the best players to endlessly farm the lowest card tiers for easy tokens and rerolled top-tier weapons vie Saint's engrams. We're going to change that without fundamentally altering the game mode or the focus on wins, and we're going to do it with a Consumable. Introducing to you:  the Mark of Perseverance.

The Mark of Perseverance is a consumable that has a chance to drop a piece of non-powerful Trials gear previously available in the season or unlocked in your loot pool. It only triggers on a Trials Win and the Mark of Perseverance disappears when the gear is earned.  The chances of a drop start low and go up the more games you win on a single Trials card, with the lowest chances at your first game since application and increasing steadily with each subsequent win on the same card (for example, starting at 11% on game 1 and increasing to 66% on games 6+). If a new card is started, players still keep their drop rate but it won't increase until players exceed their previous win rate or the consumable is reapplied.  Players purchase a Mark of Perseverance with Trials Tokens just as they purchase the Engrams now - though maybe at a reduced cost as players will still need to continue playing matches after acquiring it. You can't just start with it, you have to EARN it by demonstrating your effort to win and completing matches good or bad.

Remove Saint's engram for tokens.  We don't need it, it clogs up the lower tier games with extreme sweat as players farm tokens.  We need to push serious gear farmers to the really sweaty tier of Trials, making a worthy set of opponents to challenge top tier players.  We are instead going to have him sell Marks of Perseverance for tokens. This rewards players working to improve themselves, can only be acquired after playing several games or completing weekend bounties, and lets players invest their tokens each weekend without punishing players who didn't make significant reward progress during this week's event. It also safely allows Bungie to remove tokens each weekend because players can save Marks for future weekends instead.  The pool always increases as each new piece of gear is introduced, preventing players from effectively farming for a single item by holding back on wins.  The most consistent way to farm a specific item is to win it at the 3-5-7 and Flawless, but you can also hope for a drop via the Mark.

As far as Flawless/Adept weapons, I think Bungie already successfully demonstrated how to do this just last season.  Going flawless should add an additional perk roll to the final perk column of the weapon similar to the Season of Dawn weapons with the late stage season pass upgrade.  These Adept weapons would have two perks in the final column, increasing your chances of a good roll and giving a minor but important difference to the weapon that didn't make them automatically superior to no-Flawless drops of the same gear. Add a different cosmetic skin and you have a system that provides unique gear for Flawless guardians without creating an immediate ""rich get richer"" scenario.",6,1585157778,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fougl2/trials_fix_that_keeps_a_pinnacle_pvp_mindset/,DestinyTheGame,1

foucuo,TurquoiseLuck,Seraph Towers on the Moon are much more fun than EDZ,"Sincerely, good job here. The event on the moon is actually fun.

In the EDZ all the enemies felt like bullet sponges, and sometimes they seemed to sneak in to the zones with no chance to stop them. The yellow bar enemies were tough to take down and overall it felt like a much bigger grind.

On the Moon however the enemies feel more responsive and fair. With a good LMG you can mow them down in their hordes, which is much more satisfying, and the knights take a much more reasonable amount of damage to kill. Also they don't teleport or jump around, unlike the Fallen and Cabal, so you can actually play it like the tower-defense game mode it was intended.

I think that's a better balance for the hive; lots of enemies but manageable HP bars. Routes that you can see coming and deal with effectively.

Here's hoping the next bunch of Seraph Towers are as good.",80,1585157423,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foucuo/seraph_towers_on_the_moon_are_much_more_fun_than/,DestinyTheGame,1

fou6p0,TheChunkMaster,"Bungie, as long as you're blindly nerfing weapon types because a lot of people use them, why can't you at least do it faster?","It seems to take Bungie at least a season to roll out even the simplest of weapon changes, and it's becoming clear that they just blindly nerf whatever weapons are being used the most instead of employing common sense (like with the recent sniper nerfs) with their balancing changes. As a result, we often end up with months-long, even years-long, periods where certain weapons that were simply competent at first are now absolute trash until Bungie's next sandbox update, and even then they may fail to fix the problems they created. 

Bungie, if you're going to wantonly make simple changes to the sandbox, then why can't you roll out these changes sooner? If you're going to just react to a more prominent weapon archetype by nerfing it, then why can'y you reach faster than a few months? It's clear that you're not really using the data you have (at least not properly), so don't bother wasting time to ""review"" that data and just crank out the changes, however good or asinine they may be, the week you feel they need to be made. 

In short, Bungie should stop reviewing their weapon data so much since it's clear that it doesn't improve the fixes they implement and just slows them down. Personally, I'd prefer Bungie to be fast reactionaries instead of slow ones, because this way, if they screw up on balancing changes, they can react to that screw-up and patch it up in a more reasonable time frame.",0,1585156857,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fou6p0/bungie_as_long_as_youre_blindly_nerfing_weapon/,DestinyTheGame,1

It's time to change the strategy, Bungie","I know it is not a consensus opinion, but due to the circumstances that a large part of the world population experiences, it would be good for Bungie and other publishers to bring CBMM back to all playlists. 

Before you hit the downvote hard, let me explain my point, the problem has been getting worse with every Iron Banner that passes, having reached the point that yesterday, in an attempt to do the Iron Banner quest, adding the SBMM and team balance problems to the fact that worldwide internet connections are collapsing due to intensive use, I had the worst Destiny pvp experience I remember, having faced 6stacks of high skill players from the other side of the planet , completely lagged, in more than 90% of my games.

I believe that not everyone has this experience, because apparently I am in the top half of the algorithm that Bungie uses to do the matchmaking / team balance, but in the times we live in, when the internet that we all use is being overloaded, it would be good to bring CBMM back in all playlists.",86,1585156386,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fou1ud/sbmm_team_balance_is_not_working_as_expected_its/,DestinyTheGame,1

fotzd2,brunocar,Champions are bad game design.,"Everyone in this god forsaken subreddit complains about recycled content, but I never see anyone complaining about the real problem of said content, the ONLY thing added this season beyond numerical increments to the levels of enemies on any new activity, is champions, which are supposed to be interesting to fight but all they are is annoying, not for one reason, not for 2 reasons, but WAY more than that, essentially everything around them is terrible:

- The mod situation: why in hell would you equip anything besides anti champion mods on the corresponding weapon types right now? there is no reason to try out different things or hunting for every weapon mod if you are new because they are literally worthless, anti champion mods aren't there to improve your effectiveness against champions, they are the difference between tickling a champion thats 20 power levels below you and being able to kill a champion 20 power levels above you, its a binary, either you can kill them or you don't, so either weapon mods are a glimmer sink for where you have to swap mods in an out for each activity, or they just restrict choice.

- Nothing interesting: champions aren't engaging to fight, they are just old enemies with their stats buffed that can do their annoying move more frequently, be it the flash missiles for colossi or the teleport for captains, it just comes down to either standing still dealing as much DPS as you can or chasing them to make them stand still so that you can do the former.

- No challenge: the champions arent hard to fight, if you have mods equipped they are hardly any different from upper rank enemies, hell, the sniper legionary in the arms dealer nightfall is more interesting to fight and its literally just that, a legionary with more health and a sniper rifle.

- Frustrating synergies: fighting more than one champion at a time makes a boring task into a frustrating one, 2 captains make them impossible to track as they are indistinguishable and move too quickly, a servitor and a captain is annoying because the DPS the captain deals doesnt let you kill the servitor protecting it, etc, etc. essentially all combinations of champions are less challenging and more annoying.

TL;DR: many thing in this game need to be adjusted, but champions either need a complete revamp or they need to be removed outright, they add nothing to the game.",22,1585156166,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotzd2/champions_are_bad_game_design/,DestinyTheGame,1

Trials was supposed to be brought back in a new and fresh way, but has only been sacrificed to keep player numbers up in a completely hollow season.

I have gone flawless both weeks so far but have 0/4 towards the triumph. Some friends I spoke to that also went flawless had 0/4 , others had 1/4. The blessed ones got the right progress and are at 2/4. I wanted to post this to get some feedback on whether this is happening to you guys &amp; if Bungie knows of the issue at hand.

fotkzk,slaggindragon,About Bows,"Hello all!

I've seen a few posts here and there either praising or diminishing the value of the bow weapon class. Much of it is simply ignorance (if innocent) of what the bow is capable of. 

The Iron banner quest this week (which I assume is where the bow posts are coming from) sees its own bow as a reward for one of the quest steps. It's a pretty good one too with a 612 draw time and tempo/vorpal. It's no accuracy MW God rolled 612 subtle but it's a great bow to really get the feel for how bows work in PvP and otherwise until you get a better rolled subtle or accrued. 

I highly encourage anyone interested in running a bow, already running a bow or even a pro with the weapon to check out the guide below.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CruciblePlaybook/comments/fkgm0k/an_indepth_guide_to_using_a_bow_in_competitive/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

This guy hit unbroken with a bow and can show you how effective they can be to use(with the right roll or exotic) and how terrifying it can be to play against for your opponents. I highly recommend you read this guide before simply vaulting your bows and declaring them useless. He's also incredibly nice and streams often for those interested in watching how he plays. 

I was once someone who posted my distaste for the weapon  and now it's really all I use. Sure you're not gonna be able to sit back and just pull your hardlight trigger to win, but a little bit of skill goes a long way with the bow, one of the only truly balanced weapon classes in this game. Soon you'll be taking other people's lunch money, and buying them a bow with it.",13,1585154831,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotkzk/about_bows/,DestinyTheGame,1

fotkgm,ImJustStatingFax,"In a fast paced game, where every class is fast, only 1 meter buff to Warlock's melee is not enough.","Title, there's nothing much to be said.   


Warlocks always suffered the melee problem since D2. Their melee speed fell significantly behind the other 2 classes. After alot of times of complaints about that, Bungie finally decided to give them a buff. Every Warlock was happy, until they announced the buff will only be 1 fucking meter range. The Crucible is so fast, any class can easily close the gap, 1 meter isn't even much in D2, a game where invisibility, Gemini Jesters, Antues Wards, Top Tree Dawnblade, Hunters overall, and other things are a thing. They need more than that, or something else, here is my suggestion.  


1- Just equalize between all the classes in range and speed

2-Give them a 2-2.5 meter buff instead of only 1.  


That's my opinion. Because Warlocks STILL have the disadvantage in every melee duel, 1 meter isnt enough.",4,1585154781,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotkgm/in_a_fast_paced_game_where_every_class_is_fast/,DestinyTheGame,1

fotjq3,The_Louster,My thoughts on Weapon Retirement,"With Season of the Worthy out, Bungie introduced the concept of weapon retirement that they will be implementing down the road. Some people are for Weapon Retirement, while others are against it. I’m part of the latter.

I took the time to watch several YouTubers including Datto in order to understand those who support WR. I cab see the logic behind it. Bungie wants us to use the new weapons they come out with and they want to get rid of the stagnant weapon loadouts/perks in pinnacle content. However, I firmly believe this can be fixed with rebalancing and reworks of weapons and perks. Have a weapon that’s too strong or weak? Just nerf or buff it appropriately. Rampage or Kill Clip is top tier? Make them more situational. Rampage can work against minors, Kill Clip against majors, and Vorpal Weapon against bosses (and maybe a tiny nerf in Crucible). Voila, a rework to current perks that will still make them viable, but not the definitive perks to use. Maybe add more damage perks for variety (like one that increases damage when you do melee damage or get a grenade kill, or increase reload speed when using your class ability).

Another thing all the supporters of weapon retirement also keep bringing up power creep, but do not explain what it means. Is it weapons steadily getting more and more powerful? Because that’s not a thing. We see buffs and nerfs all the time throughout Destiny’s history, which have created many different metas.That’s not power creep, that’s power SHIFT. If we had power creep, then most weapons would be tearing through enemies like Recluse by now or have more range than Dust Rock Blues and Mindbenders.

This weapon retirement however is forced power creep. Granted it’s for pve, Trials, and IB only but the point stands. In the new endgame content (which everyone would be striving to play with friends), the many weapons collected over the years are now worthless. Sure, you can go into old patrol areas and use the outdated weaponry. What about the potential new areas they might add? You won’t be able to use your old weapons in those anymore because the area will conform to the new power level like they did with the moon.

And how will they replace all the old unique weapons? What will be the point of doing the old raids, Forges, or Menagerie if all the gear is just a collector’s item? Are they going to add new pinnacle/ritual gear to grind for each season to replace the old ones (Python, Hush, Recluse, Redrix, Randy’s Komodo, etc). If not, then there’s no point to do the quests.

This weapon retirement overall just appears to be a super lazy solution to throw out the best weapons currently in the game without addressing them. I can only hope Bungie is going to address all these points when WR is finally implemented. Who knows, maybe they already did and I just didn’t hear it or missed it in the videos addressing WR.",8,1585154713,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotjq3/my_thoughts_on_weapon_retirement/,DestinyTheGame,1

fotirz,Soleceon,Updated my document on every weapon perk in the game to 2.8.0.1. Hope some of you find it useful!,"Got tired of having to look around between numerous different videos and sites to try and find information on perks in game, and got tired of seeing constant misinformation and even a complete lack of numbers for perks as well. So, I decided to do something about it and make this guide.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X4xq4dwtfOGa2ane-GfJNtGGtKH0lOslm1-6RXo6xrE/edit?usp=sharing

This guide does NOT have info for the exotic perks in the game, nor does it have the info for the Pinnacle perks as they aren't on any other weapons beyond just the one (Master of Arms, Killing Tally, etc). I DID however include any magazine or barrel perks that I felt were prudent to include in here because of a notable effect on function in game, but excluded numeric (+5 range, -10 handling, etc.) and scope perks as they're numeric and sort of relative to each individual weapon. I did however go over Zoom and its effect on the range for guns.

Anything that isn't attributed to someone specifically I either ""knew"" already and went out to double check and gather information on or was tested from start to finish myself. Testing methods and all that jazz are towards the bottom.

Some perks are just plain funky in how they operate or are difficult to get exact numbers on, so I recently pivoted over to doing a ""Grade"" system for the potency of perks as many times the values for how much a perk boosts things like handling or reload speed can vary massively % wise between different weapon archetypes. Was working on this fairly late at night so I might have missed something here or there. If you've got any questions feel free to ask!

If there's any info in here that's missing and you'd like to add in, or if you can show is incorrect using a proper method, please do reach out to me so I can edit the guide to be more accurate (I'll give credit where credit is due. Don't pass others work off as your own.)",28,1585154625,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotirz/updated_my_document_on_every_weapon_perk_in_the/,DestinyTheGame,1

fotgok,Razyel_Kain,"Hey Bungie, here`s an Idea you should think about...fix your damn servers","This is a rant which is partly aggravated due to trials and Iron Banner launching this week. I am getting sick and tired of being punished by Bungie for having good internet connection

Just so everybody gets a clear idea what I am talking about, I live in Scotland. While Scotland does not have the best internet i am lucky enough to have a 350Mb connection and a Netgear Nighthawk gaming Router connected directly to my device. Why am I mentioning all this? Not to brag, but just to explain the setup and the gear i am working with. Back in my home country, I have the same Nighthawk router but a 1gb line (very cheap, roughly 12 Euro/month)

First of all, I have been living where I am for the past year and  I have played quite a few Multiplayer FPS games (Destiny 1, Apex, Battlefield, the former H1Z1, Dayz, etc, you name it, i might have played it)  and so far the only game I have issues with is Destiny 2

What are my issues? Other player\`s connections. My connection to steam is great. Average Latency is 40-50ms and to destiny when I am PvE\`ing is 65-75ms. I rarely get a latency more than 100ms. Even with downloading/streaming on other devices, it stays in the 65-75ms range.

Enter Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner where connection is skill based, which means latency is not factored in, or if it is it\`s hidden. Which means i have to play against Telly McTeleporty from godknows where who might or might not be playing on a Potato Connection. 

In the last 2 weeks of playing trials and Yesterday\`s IB, i have experienced it all. Hits not registering or Killing hits that register are displayed with a delay of 2-3 seconds (What i mean by that is - headshot with a sniper, nothing happens for 1-2 seconds then the enemy player drops dead. 2-3 seconds later i get the notification in the lower left corner of the screen)

Players teleporting or lagging so bad that they dissapear for 1-2 seconds, yet somehow they manage to kill me.

Random disconnections from the server mid game, or mid strike, or mid-gambit because reasons.

So yes, I am starting to feel like i am being punished by Bungie for the fact that i am on a good internet connection. Do not get me wrong, i do not blame the players who play on a bad internet connection because they don\`t have a choice and that is the only option they have. I blame Bungie for being cheap when it comes to servers quality. Let\`s face it, when it comes to server issues, Bungie is King/Queen of Fux-ups. Remember Shadowkeep launch?

To end this, I am not a PvP player, I play mostly 10 games/week for the Bright dust and when IB comes around, and i am quite an average player. I would like to play more PvP but issues like this and the lack of decent rewards makes me steer clear of PvP most times

So yeah, whomever from Bungie reads this (if they do). Here\`s an Idea. How about you fix your damn servers. Especially now that trials are back.",13,1585154429,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fotgok/hey_bungie_heres_an_idea_you_should_think/,DestinyTheGame,1

Most people use aggressive snipers for example while the other versions are untouched except for fun pve play to mess around. 

Same goes for shotguns. Just a few were/are used but there are so many others. Then it becomes which one people like to use rather than damage output. Perks would still matter so as to continue looking for the perfect gun, but then it stops being about trying to find the perfect ""named"" gun and it's about all weapons. Thought there's so much focus on trying to find out the meta every season that it becomes tiring to keep up and be disappointing that the gun will be nerfed in a few seasons (or not, jottun..). But if all guns had equal dps, wouldn't it diminish broken weapons, allow for making solutions that are up to people and not one standard. Of course you still need a sniper for GoS but would be fun to use other snipers than just aggressive all the time.

So in comp, the matchmaking system is dogshit. A lot of times I get a 5 player game which results in a 2v3 for me or the opponent. There is also no skill based matchmaking whatsoever (at least from my experience), either our team stomps or the other team stomps. This is very frequent and for me, it is usually my team that is getting stomped. This is very annoying for me as I get to 4500-4700 and my hard work is immediately destroyed and sometimes it isn’t even our teams fault cuz it’s a 2v3. Bot to sound like I have a god complex but most matches, I have to carry my team. For example, in one game, I got 20 kills and my teammates got 5 and 6. Of course we lost that game. In trials, I get god teams all the time that are above my skill level. Many godly teams also farm tokens by resetting their cards over and over again.

fosnc3,ku_man23,"Hard Light needs adjusted, not completely nerfed. PvP is in a decent place","I'm a PS4 player for context so I cannot speak towards PC. I've a pretty active PvP player and have played a ton of trials so far. Many people have been calling for Hard Light nerfs and I get it. Nobody likes getting killed by a laser show when trying to get to the lighthouse. I am going to suggest an adjustment to HL and give my thoughts why I think so.

The only thing I suggest doing is decreasing the mag size. Having so many shots in the mag is pretty nuts especially when spamming around corners. I know people want the ricochet to be nerfed but THAT IS WHAT MAKES THE GUN EXOTIC. Exotics should FEEL POWERFUL. It is so cool that HL is actually good and viable after years and years of it being a meme. Decreasing mag size, I feel, would help with the spam issue and stop the pre-firing issue. 

I think PvP is in a great place (not perfect) in regards to weapons. ARs are good now, 150 rpm HCs can challenge and beat ARs in the right range. Pulse rifles have their place in the meta depending on the map. Shotguns seem fine and I have mixed feeling around snipers.

Overall, I'm having a blast playing PvP for the first time in a long time. Please Bungie. Don't nerf ARs.

fosmbr,maxmurdoch,A fix for stacked teams farming tokens in Trials,"**Problem**

At the moment, good teams reset their wealth card often so they play worse teams at the beginning of their cards. As matchmaking is partially card-based, this means more casual PvP players are having their cards ruined early. This circumvents one of the design goals of card-based matchmaking, which is for matches to get progressively harder. In time, I expect this will turn a lot of people off of trials.

**Fix**

Remove tokens. Instead, give rewards at the third, fifth and seventh win of every card. Doing this means resetting your card would be less efficient, because you'd only get loot every 3 games.  Rewarding loot on the 5th and 7th games encourages teams to stick with their cards, because their loot per win goes up (as it should, given the games will be harder, depending on how well card-based match making works) and they get closer to flawless, which rewards more loot still.

1. My first guess is that we might get updated D1 locations (Dreadnaught, Venus, Cosmodrome/Plaguelands and D1 Mars area) which would truly make it ""like no other time in Destiny"".

2. My second guess is that it will be the beginning of a game wide update similar to D1 Age of Triumph. Where literally everything in the game will be updated to current power with updated rewards. Of course this time the D2 ""Age of Triumph"" era would last a lot longer than the D1 Age of Triumph era if this were the case.

fos0s1,SgtTryhard,I think Bungie is doing to Destiny what Oryx did to Nokris.,"For those who don't understand that reference: Bungie is trying to pretend their time with Activision never happened. Forsaken was the last season developed by Bungie and Activision together, and we all agree that it was awesome(I know, it wasn't perfect. But still, it had more ups than downs). Lots of good systems were invented, including Pinnacle Weapons, D1-style kinetic/energy/heavy ammo system, and the Dreaming City and Last Wish raid.

And when Bungie decided to split with Activision and released the ViDoc, they first mentioned the ""Evolving World"" Development philosophy. I think by this Bungie wanted to recreate the Dreaming City; even to this day, I think it is the perfect example of this philosophy; The way the Dreaming City was corrupted after the Last Wish WFK, the 3-week curse cycle, and the hidden ahamkara eggs/bones, the ascendant chests and challenges, you name it.

But instead of starting from the Dreaming City, Bungie went ""Nah, let's start this over."" and practically abandoned the Dreaming City altogether(Remember when the Blind Well dropped powerful gear?), and started developing the Moon as their starting point. Don't get me wrong, the Moon was beautifully designed with its unique atmosphere, but it wasn't really good compared to the Dreaming City. If Bungie wanted the Moon to be the next Dreaming City, then they were too hasty on that. With how close the Shadowkeep's story was tied with Darkness, they should have done some more lore development with the Dreaming City; Savathun, for instance. Savathun is the biggest candidate for the final boss of D2, and the perfect opportunity for her appearance was on the Dreaming City. Bungie themselves even acknowledged this when Gladd actually did the 999-power level Solo Shattered Throne. I'm not exactly a lore nerd, but I know enough that if Savathun decided to show herself, the perfect place for her to appear would be in the Dreaming City.

Back to my point. As Bungie progressed over SotU, SotD, and now SotW, they're removing the Forsaken-introduced contents bit by bit. Pinnacle Weapons were replaced with Ritual Weapons without their unique perks, which is now in the brink of being removed altogether. Curated Rolls were suddenly gone. Eververse bounties were gone. It's as if Bungie intentionally wants to pretend Forsaken never happened. Pinnacles and Curated Rolls had their flaws, but we still grinded for them because they were worth it. We do not want to grind for 7 enhancement cores and some legendary shards; We want to grind for weapons that are actually fun to use and fairly good.

And yes, I know Bungie doesn't have enough manpower to do all these things anymore. But Bungie isn't even trying anymore. The outrageous amount of FOMO and bounty grinding, and Eververse monetization system is so disappointing that I don't think Destiny is going to be good anymore.",8,1585149480,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fos0s1/i_think_bungie_is_doing_to_destiny_what_oryx_did/,DestinyTheGame,1

Now I know, from a previous thread, that Bungie only keeps things high on their todo list of feature requests if there is a pretty strong and consistent feedback loop on wanting it. I can't remember the context or find the thread, however something else was previously being mentioned as not having high priority due to a percieved drop off in 'Complaints/Feedback'. A brief search on collections and random rolls provides a large volume of threads on the matter, of which here is a small section from recent months. This is at least some indicator that the levels of desire for updates to collections really hasn't dropped off in any meaningful manner. So I don't see this as being the reason for the relegation of the issue to backlog.

I understand that the previous comments did not represent any solid commitment to making changes to the collections aspect of the user experience. It heavily implied it, but never explicitly stated it. I'm just curious as to why it stopped being something actively looked at, and more so if it isn't being actively looked at why Bungie are unwilling to take the desire out back and put it out of it's misery if it's flat out unfeasible. If there are technical limitations, man power limitations or any other form of limitation that essentially rules out this feature request, in the short to medium term, set our expectation through transparent communication with the community so we (I) can stop living in hope you might improve this area.",3,1585148867,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foruiw/hey_cozmodmg_id_love_to_know_when_did_random/,DestinyTheGame,1

Is it better than Hard Light? No, but maybe you want to use a different Exotic like Chaperone or Wardcliff Coil.

Is it better than The Summoner? Probably not but not everybody has one. And maybe you don't have a Gnawing Hunger with a great roll either.

The good things I will say about Galliard:

* Can roll with Quickdraw/Outlaw and Kill Clip
* Has amazing recoil with a Counterbalance Mod equipped
* Is that 600 rpm archetype like Hard Light, Summoner, and Hunger

There's not really a reason to go grind for one, but maybe you're like me and have one that's pretty good just sitting in the Vault from the Black Armory season. It's what I use in Crucible if I want an AR but feel like using an Exotic kinetic or heavy weapon, for the time being at least, because my Gnawing Hunger rolls aren't impressive and I haven't stepped into Trials yet.",26,1585147801,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/forjp7/dont_have_the_summoner_or_gnawing_hunger_galliard/,DestinyTheGame,1

force3,Crusader3456,The New Seasonal Mods and Exotics This Season Have Made Me Combine 2 Feedback Pieces into One with a Unique Twist.,"Felwinter's Helm, Monte Carlo, and the Seasonal/Artifact Mods create a very powerful build (and an extremely fun one at that). However, it falls short in game because of several reasons, many of which have been the source of feedback for months (if not longer)

* Monte Carlo has no Catalyst preventing it from making orbs on double kills, reducing potential synergy from ability refreshing mods based around orbs. This hurts primaries more than specials more than heavies.  Why are Exotics still being shipped without Catalysts 2 years into the existence of catalysts? I get that they have to play catchup with tons designed while the concept of Catalysts was in its infancy and early growing pains into more synergistic effects, but that should not be at the expensive of new Exotics. In my next section I discuss how the anti champion mods in general need to change.  Perhaps the ones with intrinsic anti champion effects could resemble my ideas there.


* Monte Carlo Carlo can't equip champion mods like all other exotics.  This has been feedback for a while now. Thid makes most exotics feel useless in Endgame and as a result this build in its entirety feels useless in endgame. But some exotics were designed to be Anti Champion intrinsically.  That's great, but it doesnt make the game play or feel any better, in fact it puts a huge limit on any future builds because they exist. Great conceptual thought that was horrible in practice.


* Champion Mods being restricted to only a few archetypes of guns makes endgame feel extremely limited even when ignoring exotics.  You want me to go unlock a mod for every weapon type for every champion type I will do it. It adds more progression for me.  But what about the artifact ones? Make them more potent. If regular versions do 1x damage to barriers, overload for 5 seconds, or give 1.5x damage on Unstopables, make the Seasonal mods double. Or make the Seasonal mods cause special effects when they stagger a champion.  Don't limit us with the Artifact, buff us with it. 



Right now in order to use this build in an Ordeal I am forced to use double primary to get past the limitations of the current system in place killing my DPS and fun.  Some might say it is balanced. I say it's boring and limited which leads to not having fun.



In the end what is my TLDR? We hate being limited on what we can run whether it be all the hyper specific requirements with bounties, anti champion staggering, or just as simple as missing benefits from lack of catalysts.",0,1585147041,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/force3/the_new_seasonal_mods_and_exotics_this_season/,DestinyTheGame,1

Still have a bunch of naysayers who say it's the player's connection and not Bungie's fault but whatever, can't convince everyone all the time. 

Yesterday I ran Garden with a LFG group and came across a unique situation which might give some people insight or help Bungie figure out whats happening. 

All 6 of us grouped in orbit, no problem. Load into GoS and one person gets Beavered. We wait after the Vex gate for this guy to try to rejoin 4 more times but getting Beaver or Quail. 5th time he gets in, I get Beaver. I load back in, he get Beaver. He loads in, I get Beaver. 

Something in the game didn't like the two of us connecting. Checked networking. Both of us using Moderate NAT and UPNP enabled so there should be no issues. 

We tried something else. Both of us left the FT, he loaded into GoS and I tried to directly /join on him and the game said ""Unable to connect to target player"". It literally did not allow the two of us to connect. 

We both restarted, he loaded into GoS, I joined onto him directly, and the remaining 4 people joined onto us. Ran GoS wih zero errors. 

This is likely what's happening in other event instances where you directly interact with other players. The more players, the more likelihood this will happen like in QP or IB where the game doesnt like someone connecting with any one of the other players so one will get kicked and in that case it's a one and done where we were able to force trying to reconnecting as much as we wanted.",34,1585146751,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/for9rr/a_beaver_explanation_unique_situation_showed_some/,DestinyTheGame,1

for1be,Dawgboy1976,It’s incredibly disheartening that Bungie hasn’t responded to a single post about the state of the meta (PvE),"There are a lot of issues with the meta right now, but 2 of them in particular were made based on fundamentally flawed criteria. Those nerfs are:

Nerfs caused by auto-reload that need to be reversed now that it’s gone (box breathing, trench barrel, Sleeper Simulant, shotguns across the board PvE damage-wise, possibly others that I’m forgetting so l please let me know in the comments)

Sniper damage nerf that was wildly uncalled for and purely a reactionary measure instead of an actual attempt to balance the game.

These nerfs have no business remaining untouched and it’s clear that the player base knows it. We have been incredibly vocal about this, but not one post on these topics that I’ve seen has garnered a Bungie employee comment explaining the fundamental issues with these nerfs, or at least acknowledged that they come from flawed bases. This is really disheartening as a PvE player because it feels like Bungie just doesn’t care. I want this game to be in a good state because I love it and I love playing it, but Bungie’s radio silence on this issue sends the message that they don’t have any intention of even looking at reversing these nerfs.

And the argument of “it would take man power that could better be used elsewhere” is bullshit. What are we getting this season that is more important than balance updates? 3 shitty reskinned obelisks? A public event that isn’t bad but isn’t anything particularly interesting? 50,000 Eververse cosmetics? PLEASE give us SOME glimmer of hope that you might be working on these issues.

for145,Ramikyn,Combat Bow's need new Perks,"Bows need new and more interesting perk choices. Outside of some wacky builds or a quest forcing you to use them I rarely see bows in PvP or PvE. Here are some perk ideas that could make using a bow a bit more interesting and please share any perk ideas you might have.

&amp;#x200B;

New Perk Ideas.

***Slight of Hand:*** Landing a Precision Hit gives all your weapons a temporary boost in stow, draw and ready speed. I get the quick access sling mod already does this for stowing bows but this perk could also apply a quick draw and snapshot effect to your other weapons. Basing this idea on the whole Bow/Eriana's Vow build. 

***Lob Shot***: After Landing a Fully Drawn Precision Hit your next arrow gets a boost in damage if NOT fully drawn. Basically land a head shot, aim up and try to lob an arrow as fast as you can at your target and that arrow will have the same damage that it would have if fully drawn. If Bungie let me pick 1 perk to add to bows it would be this one. 

***Arrow to the Knee***: None Precision Hits add a 2 second debuff that causes the target to take additional damage if crouched, sprinting or sliding while the debuff is active. To be fair I just want to see a perk named this but could be a fun perk, especially against ape nation.   

&amp;#x200B;

Perks currently in game that could be interesting if they were Bow perks:

***Backup Plan***: Basically the same effect as you get on Fusion Rifles, super fast draw time for a short period after swapping to your bow. In all seriousness this would be an amazing perk on bows. 

***Box Breathing***: Bungie could tweak this perk for bows a bit, maybe it allows it to 1 shot head shot in PvP but the accuracy stat is reduced so head shots are harder. I would also make it so the perk doesn't activate until your bow is fully drawn and looking down the sights for 1.5 second. Also the perk only last for 1.5 seconds so that you would need nearly perfect timing to take advantage of this perk.

***Full Court*** (***but reversed***): Okay this one is out there (pun intended) but hear me out. Normally full court gives a damage buff starting at 10 meters and maxing out at 50 meters, however that might be a bit busted on bows so I say reverse the buff. You get max damage between 0 to 5 meters and then the buff falls off every 5 meters after that. The idea would be that the higher impact bows fully drawn could 1 shot body shot up to 5 meters and 1 shot head shot up to 10 meters if Guardians are low resilience. This might sound busted but some shotguns can kill up to 8 meters and The Chaperone can 1 shot head shot lot further than that.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway just some ideas to discuss. I understand that if you add perks that are too strong it devalues any weapon that can't roll with it but with weapon sun-setting around the corner maybe we can see more interesting perks that truly change how we use a weapon.",21,1585145845,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/for145/combat_bows_need_new_perks/,DestinyTheGame,1

for0qq,sarsante,Why IB/Trials armor are better than Raid armor?,"This affects mostly high end pvers, if you don't care about min-max your builds or have the proper stat distribution this is not for you, please don't reply stuff like I've a 30-30-30-30-30-30 build and it's perfect.

First and foremost let me make clear exactly what I'll talk because I know some people will say but the season pass, or world drops... The subject here is farmable armor with seasonal mod slot. Prime engrams don't have seasonal mod slots and you can't farm season pass, you claim the pieces and like it or not the fixed roll that's what you'll get. In pve we can get high stats from master NF but said stats are rolled in exotics, so most of them end up not used and you can’t have 4 exotics armor pieces in one build.

I understand certain weapons being locked behind pvp such as recluse, randy's, mountaintop. Basically if you want them you go there, get the quest done and that's totally fine. Then I read on this sub people talking about 64 stats from trials, I play 24 IB matches and I get after match drops better than raid drops including a 66 stats chest.

I go check my vault and I found 1 pair of boots with 64 stats from GoS which I've 38 clears. Not a single one piece higher than that from any raid, in +70 clears considering checkpoints or +40 full clears.

Loot comparison here: https://imgur.com/a/XqPDvfB

I want to ask why is it a thing to have better armor to drop from pvp than pve? Why doing the high end pve activities I can't get the same loot quality as doing pvp? Why don't both drops have the same quality?

foqnu4,OverlordPrime94,Please name the next season: season of torture,"&amp;#x200B;

This new season and season pass (repetitive bs items) is worthless. 

The real reason its name season of the worthy is because you should really be worthy to calmly deal with Bungie's decision so far.

Iron Banner quest is a real torture. Nobody cares about capturing point, they are just going around and shooting stuff to get the quest done with.  THIS QUEST IS SHIT. Easy content that does not require any development effort. Recycled material. 

Who's the guy that says enforce that stupid quest. WTF man.

Crucible is another nightmare this season.

Seraph Tower is boring and Repetitive. Can't find enough people to do it. Worst fireteam is lock at 3 people.

Their is no real purpose of upgrading bunker's. Most perks are meh.

foqjhg,WebHead1287,Spinfoil hat theory: Season of the Worthy IS Luke Smiths current vision for the game and that's terrifying,"So like the rest of you I am not exactly having the best time with Season of the Worthy (Bounties). I hate to beat a dead horse, because lets be honest it's dead, but the future of Destiny seems dire right now. Why am I so concerned? Because in the latest directors cut Luke specifically mentions making old content what the season is about. That he wanted to move away from season activities that pull players out of the core content (Strikes, crucible, Gambit). Now a lot of youtubers will mention that there is no way they have had time to correct their trajectory to adjust for the failures of the first two seasons. Personally, I am a little worried that they have and this is the result.

&amp;#x200B;

Think of what you guys have been doing this season. You have been doing bounties over and over and over but what have these bounties been forcing you to do? They've been sending you back into the core modes that I mentioned above. This is not fun. Why is it not fun? Well we have had almost all of the content we are having to play since the launch of D2. If this is the future of Destiny and Seasons I have to say to Bungie, please rethink this. This is not fun in any way. I do not have the answers for what you should do to keep players engaged but this is far from it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I am being a little paranoid here but the more I think about it the more it seems like this may have been the vision Luke had to get players engaged in core activities again and that is troubling.",11,1585144000,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foqjhg/spinfoil_hat_theory_season_of_the_worthy_is_luke/,DestinyTheGame,1

foqas1,TheWagn,HOT TAKE Titans - bubble is not your only super,"Alright Titans, put down the crayons for a second and hear me out before you downvote. Also, obviously you want to run bubble for raid encounters with a dps phase. You have been regulated to a bubble bot for that and nobody is going to let you do anything different. With that said, here are my thoughts on bubble this season. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my bro and I ran some master ordeals and nightmare hunts for pinnacles last night. A common theme was every single 3rd person we got off lfg was running bubble titan. Very creative. One would think this is the best/safest build for when you are under leveled, but it's actually not very useful at the end of the day. Especially when you have a well of radiance on the team. 

We also noticed throughout the entire night that the bubble never made a single difference. Especially now that bungie messed up the super and it only makes 1 orb, it is even more useless. It is essentially just a damage buff in the best case, or a death trap in the worst case. WoL is the best damage buff in the game, sure, but it comes with a plethora of downsides. 

Bubble cons:

\-You can't regen the super during it's activation like WoR with phoenix, resulting in much fewer supers

\-You can't shoot out of it, so you can easily get trapped in there when ads approach and you can't do anything to them

\-The overshield saint 14 helm provides is SUPER WEAK it will instantly be shredded by ads if you step out on master level content. Once we are higher level it won't be so bad, but it is definitely not very strong

\-Your health does not regen faster in the bubble so you can't be aggressive and push with it. You have armor of light so it looks like you are full, but under that is probably your red sliver of health. You just have to stand there are regen like normal based on your recovery. 

\-If you die your bubble goes bye bye. 

\-It is bugged currently and only makes 1 orb

&amp;#x200B;

So bubble only really does 2 things. Provides a damage buff slightly stronger than WoR, and can be used as a panic button super to get a rez. The sad part is (in some situations) you don't even want to rez someone with the bubble because then you will both be trapped in there. You would rather just pop the bubble to ensure you survive then let them respawn somewhere safer. 

In its current state, bubble is just a worse WoR. If you could regen super by getting WoL kills, keep the bubble up if you die, or actually have a powerful overshield upon exit, it would be quite good. Or if it wasn't bugged and actually made a decent amount of orbs...

Bubble is still great for lower level content where you can smash through everything with melees and aren't really threatened by super powerful ads that can challenge your bubble. Let me offer some alternatives for master level content this season. Titans are actually a really powerful class, but as soon as they gave WoL back everyone just devolved into bubble bots and I find it quite sad, honestly. 

Middle tree sentinel - extremely powerful neutral game with the chain explosion grenades. Also has a much better panic super option with banner shield that makes you neigh unkillable, mobile, and able to generate a ton of orbs for your team. If you run ursa you can still easily get back 60-70% of your super as well. Not very helpful for boss dps since you can't shoot at the same time, but it fulfills the roll of protection super and orb generation much better than bubble. Also you have a crazy neutral game to slay out ads. 

Bottom tree sentinel - paired with doomfangs the super becomes the single most powerful ad clear in the game imo. You have the tankiness of sentinel and a shield to help you survive, and can chain shield throws for almost infinite super. You can easily clear and entire room even on a master ordeal. You make a good amount of orbs, and delete tons of ads putting pressure on your team. Also you can even finish up your rampage with a push on a champion. The melee hits do great damage to them. 

Those are 2 great options just for sentinel. There are many great builds on sunbreaker and even striker this season with all the arc mods and warmind cells. 

Try something new out titans. Put the bubble down for a second and explore your sub classes and other exotics. They are super strong!",14,1585143037,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foqas1/hot_take_titans_bubble_is_not_your_only_super/,DestinyTheGame,1

After playing about ten games I've ran into it 80% of the time.  It's pretty heartbreaking to run into an opponent who has their artifact enabled while mine is disabled.  
I've not seen any proof of what causes this.  The thought some had about joining mid game doesn't appear to be always be true.  

I'm not close to max light and my artifact isn't giving me 20+ levels.  But I'd still rather have the artifact enabled and deal with a 10 to 15 point disadvantage than a 20 to 30 point one.

foq82o,shyyie,"Some warlock paths still feel rather lackluster, here's how I'd change some.","For a while now, some warlock trees have felt pretty lackluster when compared to other classes and even other warlock attunements. Trees such as the Attunement of Elements and Attunement of Flame need a rework akin to that of the incredible Attunement of Sky rework back in Season 9, as all AoF has going for it is the super, no neutral game at all. I've seen AoE get some more use inside of pvp lately due to the arc souls, but that's all that tree has going for it as well. I feel like they should have their own Neutral game gimmicks that also slightly affect the super so that they can be on par with the others.

For AoE for example, what about playing heavily into the arc soul/rift gimmick it already kind of has, like give benefits for being in a rift or, casting your super with full ability energy (like top tree storm's transcendence perk) giving you 2 shoulder mounted arc souls for the duration of your super, or being able to fire arc soul projectiles instead of the traditional tickle fingers.
Personally for the Attunement of Flame, I'd want to see a debuff-based tree with perks such as destiny 1's Viking Funeral make a return.

And then there's devourlock. The problem with the Attunement of Hunger, isn't that it's underpowered, but rather boring to play compared to other paths. 
How I'd change this is by not changing the perks themselves, but adding exotics that play off of those perks, such as outlaw-like reload speed while devour is active, or an overshield on initial grenade consumption.

I'd like to hear some feedback on this, as I want to see these subclasses be, at the very least, fun to play let alone be viable.",1,1585142718,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foq82o/some_warlock_paths_still_feel_rather_lackluster/,DestinyTheGame,1

fopynk,Hajoaminen,Season after season the Iron Banner quests require you to be a detriment to your own team.,"How many seasons has it been? I can’t recall, it’s been that many, and still the Iron Banner questlines require you to change your loadout (in a power enabled sandbox, remind you) to use weapons that are awful in this sandbox. For example this season’s quest asks you to use SMGs and bows, which are both in a pretty bad place in terms of PvP. The people running basically anything else just steamroll through entire teams that are trying to eliminate them by shooting peas at them. Throw the stricter-than-necessary SBMM into the mix, and the outcome is nothing short of awful. Four kills with an SMG per match really doesn’t help my own team at all. I’ve rarely had less run in PvP. Maybe season 4 glory grind tops it, but it’s close.

Also, what is wrong with the matchmaking? I’ve played around a dozen and a half matches of IB since the reset, and every single one of them has been a steamroll. Either your team stomps or you get stomped. For a matchmaking algorithm so strict on skill, it’s doing a pretty abysmal job at it.

Anyway, this is just my two cents. Hope they get their matchmaking and quests sorted out eventually.",781,1585141636,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fopynk/season_after_season_the_iron_banner_quests/,DestinyTheGame,1

fopghm,-GiantSlayer-,Exotic weapons need to be more valuable in champion activities,"[As this Youtuber pointed out](https://youtu.be/QQkNVFXKogs) Exotic weapons, one of the things that make up our power fantasy and help express our identity as a player have limited use in champion activities because only a fraction of all exotics available have them. This isn’t just limited to old, year 1 exotics: new ones such as Bastion and Tommy’s matchbook are also only usable in heroic strikes, crucible, gambit, and legacy activities.

Patrick Casey has given a few ideas on how to fix this, such as giving intrinsic anti-champion capabilities to all exotics (which would understandably take up a lot of time and resources) or giving exotics mod slots (which would be terrifying in PvP). 

I would like to suggest a third option: Create a “seasonal” or “champion” slot for ALL weapons. Basically, make a second mod slot exclusively for champion mods. Of course this doesn’t mean make EVERY weapon usable in champion activities every season. The champion mods available for that season would be usable there, so for this season you could put overload rounds on, say, Monte Carlo or Suros Regime.

This would add value to exotics not specifically designed for champions while retaining the anti-champion exotics’ value because they can be used across multiple seasons without having to adhere to the current season’s weapon focus (Ex. Eriana’s vow can be used even though there’s no Barrier Hand Cannon mod).

Of course, this idea can undergo some tweaking. Should champion mods be limited to primaries? Would enabling certain exotics to be used in these activities make them too strong? Those are questions I don’t have the answer to because I don’t see the full picture, so I’ll leave that to the people who actually know how to develop a game.

fooorb,So_Rexy,Bored running strikes/patrols? Try this.,"I do only play this game casually and was looking for something to spice up the grind.

The idea: No HUD, Sword only.

You can enhance the experience by collecting all of the sword mods in the Artefact and Arc armour for the Regular mods. More ammo drops, more ammo per drop, more reserves, super energy on Sword kills, Disruptive Blade and passive guard. All of these are useful.

I run as many of these as I can. I don't have Increased Reserves or Passive Guard yet but it's still doable.

The sound design on this game does not receive enough credit. Enemies moving, shooting, throwing grenades and charging into melee to specific boss noises and even your abilities charging and your teammates in strikes. I've been guessing what weapons they are using based on the sound. It really is something.

And the music. Some of it really makes you feel so powerful as you charge at a boss five times taller than you. All while the other Guardians hang back, standing in a well, doing what they always do.

Even if this season is particularly Grind heavy or if the loop is just boring now, it's important to remember that games should be fun. And I hope you have fun trying this out.

(Word of caution, with the HUD turned off, your Ghost no longer tells you when a teammate has been killed. The voice line must trigger when the warning flashes on your HUD.

I believe I have only missed 1 quest and that was last Season's because I wasn't around much in the beginning of this year. I am a player that actually despises PvP but I love to play Crucible for some odd reason and I always enjoy Iron Banner even though I get tired of it quick. Every Iron Banner prior to this, even with all the metas that have come and gone, I have enjoyed! I've been playing Seaosn 10's Iron Banner for the last 2 hours now and I can't stand it. I'm LL 1000 without the artifact and being 1 shot by everything like a noob. I can't seem to get a kill with any weapon I own and I keep getting hit by shotguns... *so many shotguns.* 

I have had better Survival/Trials/Crucible/IB matches when I'm HALF ASLEEP than I am now. I just really don't understand it. Maybe it's because of the recent nerfs to Hand Cannons and Snipers? But I just don't feel the enjoyment in this Iron Banner and I'm just getting more and more frustrated for some reason for the first time in 6 years of this game mode. Hell even the Jotunn meta Iron Banners where I was 50+ light below everyone else was **more fun** than this, and I was being shot in the face with fiery balls of death!

foobvm,iamdanrathbone,Community Made Armour (Ornaments sets or pieces),"There are some amazing and talented 3D artists modellers and designers out there in the world. Many who at the moment are struggling with loss of income and the world going to hell. 

My thought was that you could put a call out to 3D artists etc to design/create new armour sets or pieces (ornaments) and have this armour sold in the eververse store with a large proportion of the income going to the artists themselves. Something like an 80/20 split.

- This would free up Bungie to focus on additional and key features for the game. Not having to focus and putting in a huge amount of resources on creating new armour. 

- Increase community engagement with the eververse store. (I would spend silver on a cool community made item, to support that artist). 

- Be a platform for these artists to promote themselves to employers and future projects.

I swear they're no longer listening at all unless it concerns some game-breaking bug or somehow improving the cash cow that this game has become.  


As a suggestion how about this for the quest.  
\- Capture Points in Iron Banner  
\- Kill/defeat enemies in Iron Banner (Gain bonus progression with the chosen weapon types: ratio 2 to 1, assists also grant progress but at 50% the rate of a kill)  
\- Play and complete matches of Iron Banner (Wins grant double progression streaks can boost this not sure to what degree)  
\- Kill enemies with your super in Iron Banner  
Steps **aren't separated** and can be done all at the same time.  
As for when the rewards drop you'll get a set of them when the quest is complete.

folec8,Think-Painter,Incredibly disappointed in Bungie.,"I grew up playing the halo game’s. They were my first and favorite!
I was so excited when bungie announced D1 that the day they announced I ran out and bought a ps4. As soon as I possible could I preordered and I put a ridiculous amount of hours into it. (Was really hardcore about it) then d2 comes out, and I did the same thing. Rushed out to preorder, played it nonstop... but it just wasn’t the same. So when it came out on pc, I bought it there and was much more happy, but still wasn’t fully on board. They kept putting out dlc’s and I kept buying on both pc and ps4. Eventually I had spent over $300 on destiny 2 alone. Then they release it as a *somewhat* f2p game. We get NOTHING. All of us who have at this point put years and hundreds of dollars into this game/company.... we get nothing for that. 
I’m not even mad, just disappointed. I’m so saddened I haven’t touched the game in months. I hear it’s a lot better now, and I really hope that it is.

After having had the void grenade stuff a couple seasons back and having recently got the mod Power of Rasputin from the Moon seraph tower event, I figured I would test to see if it stacked, just in case.

The mod reads: You gain a bonus to weapon damage against enemies that are near Warmind cells.

I took a 995 sniper into the Tribute hall against the ogre and stood the same distance for each shot. I have no opening shot, etc mods, but I made sure to reload, make sure no other buffs were active, etc before each shot to the ogre's face.

The results were:

* With no cell or tether: 14721
* With cell: 16194 (10%)
* With tether: 19138 (30%)
* With tether and cell: 21005 (42.6%)

So not only do they both apply, but it looks like it is multiplicative as well. We brought it into a lost sector on Titan to test too, just to make sure. Couple it with being able to reliably proc a warmind cell with Tyrant's Surge, and it feels like things could be interesting!",42,1585113928,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foktzi/seasonal_mod_power_of_rasputin_stacks_with_other/,DestinyTheGame,1

Now, I'm not talking ""oh my team is all potatoes and theirs is all gods"" I'm speaking purely from a fireteam composition standpoint.

I'd say roughly 2/3 matches have placed an entire team of solo queue players against a team of a 4-6 stack.

fokds6,iblaise,"Iron Banner, despite it’s flaws, feels WAY more rewarding than Trials of Osiris.","Let’s do a little comparison, shall we?

- Iron Banner rewards four Pinnacle sources a week, which can be easily earned with enough persistence even if you’re less skilled than others. Trials of Osiris rewards only two Pinnacle sources and two Powerful sources, the former of which requires you to win seven matches, and one of which requires a flawless run.

- Iron Banner Armor is far easier to earn and grind for. Completing the Quest, while a bit of a slog, earns you a full set of Armor which more often than not will have a decent point spread on it. You can also continue to earn Armor as drops and turn in Tokens to earn even more potentially. Trials of Osiris Armor can only be unlocked if a certain gear piece happens to be in the weekend rotation, so if you haven’t earned any pieces, then it’s impossible to earn a full set within one weekend. Up to this point too, some Armor can only be earned by going flawless.

- Iron Banner Tokens are far more plentiful. You get five per win, and three per loss, compared to Trials of Osiris requiring a Wealth Passage just to earn five per win, but always getting only one Token if you lose. The Bounties are weighted heavily in Iron Banner’s favor too, awarding a whopping 200 Tokens compared to a measly 18-28 (depending if you do the repeatable Bounties too). This not only allows you to earn more Armor and Weapons from Packages, but you get more chances at Enhanced mods too.

Sure, Trials of Osiris has some advantages, mainly that it’s around every weekend, and the Weapons and Armor are better/cooler. This is just my personal opinion though, and I’d much rather slog through Iron Banner than have an amazing Trials of Osiris card which doesn’t reward you with much in the end.",202,1585111695,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fokds6/iron_banner_despite_its_flaws_feels_way_more/,DestinyTheGame,1

Let me begin by acknowledging that this is an old quest, and that I am a Destiny filthy casual. Now that we're all clear, for the love of everything holy, please tone down the final strike. 

I do enjoy a challenging strike, but when 3 1000+ guardians go in to be repeatedly one hit by thralls in the final encounter, it's enough to drive a person insane. I had to quit before I wound up buying a new controller for myself.

For example you could have a personality that changed the way your character held their weapon in the character select/inventory screen, and maybe also changed their walking/sprinting animation. You could have ones for Spy, Gunslinger, Virtuous/Knight, Aristocrat, and some sillier ones too if they were brave enough.

fojpii,DivisionPete,"Emblems, Emblems Top Ten Emblems!!!!","OK,

I know the fix is coming right around the corner but, the question still remains why? Why.....Did they touch emblems in the first place? Lot's of different guardians placed the emblems up with pride! Showing off achievements or as in the case of some rare emblems like ""Heavy As Death"" pain. It's a key effort to stand out and show off in the tower or right before a six guardian raid activity.

Destiny is at heart a collection show off type of looter shooter game. Just look at the direction of most of the assets in Destiny 2 now.  The coolest sparrows and ghost shells are for sale in the Ever-verse store front. This is not a complaint in anyway. I for one understand if you want to grow as a game you have to make money and that's the bottom line. That said do you.... Make as much money as you need but when you see a feature in the game nobody has issues with just leave it alone.

I know they addressed this before and asked what types of tracking we would want back. So I have a top-10 list my favorites.

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""Grizzled Wolf "" Iron Banner- I have over 1000 packages turned in was all that for nothing??
2. ""Heavy As Death"" Crucible- 2,500 kills over guardians over 100 light of me was all that for nothing?
3. ""Visage Of Skorri"" Iron banner- Tracked Iron banner rank-up's.
4. ""You Are Worthy"" Trials of the Nine- Tracked flawless tickets.
5. ""Obsidian Dream"" Black Armory- gifted to you once you help out Ada-1 (No Spoilers)
6. ""Savior Of The Past"" Saint 14- Do you remember what we had to do for this? I'll remind you we put in codes after code after code.
7. ""Saladin's Pride"" Age of Triumph- Reaching level 5 in the triumph record books.
8. ""Glory To The Emperor"" Leviathan- Leviathan Prestige clears.
9. ""Crown Of Sorrow"" Crown Of Sorrow- Crown of Sorrow clears.
10. ""Restorative Light"" How much did i donate to the empyrean Restoration event? I honestly can't remember because you took that away!

&amp;#x200B;

foj6fi,Triggerthreestrikes,Destiny horror,"A recent post inspired me to write this idea. A horror styled mission, to amplify what should be a feeling of dread in the darkness’ rapidly approaching arrival.

Mission one: a quest that sends you into the arcology to find more on savathun. Everything seems to be going well. Talking to Ikora and Eris, maybe ghost makes a joke while you breeze through the festering halls. 

Then Ikora and Eris stop talking.

No, not “WhAT UR brEAkiNg uP!!1” just stop talking. Dead silence. Ghost notices, and says they’re still connected... why aren’t they talking. It’s also about here that hive enemies aren’t as numerous, with the waypoint just telling you to keep going down. Farther, Farther. Eventually ghost just starts talking to you. Little mild chit chat to ease nerves. 

Then he stops talking. No more enemies either. This is also where you realize there’s no sound. 

Nothing. Just silence. You shoot, but there’s nothing. Menus still make sound, so players know that their speakers/headphones aren’t broken. 

The mission has you go a short way where you find (mission objective here)

That’s when the lights go out. Ghost doesn’t comment, he just lights himself up and you decide to return, passing an unassuming rock.

When all hell breaks loose.

Ogres, acolytes, knights, wizards, thrall, EVERYTHING just swarms you. So you run like hell, shooting everywhere, in almost total darkness, the eerie silence long since gone. A status effect only marked as ??? Drains you down to a low health, keeping it there.

Once you make it out, Ikora and Eris express their relief, while dropping bombshell number one: Savathun wanted them to have it. Meaning bombshell number two: the hive LET you go.

foisss,CashusfromITG,"Bungie clearly does not want to remove the Basic 2 Round Gambit mode so let's make it a 2 team, 2 round Solo Challenge mode for Guardians.","Gambit Prime is fine as is and can stay a 4v4 experience, but let the basic version work as a place to master the mechanics and play as a solo player.

Basically 2 teams of almost in-direct 1v1v1v1 competition. 

2 teams of Guardians still load into both Gambit Maps same as usual to kill enemies. You still collect and bank motes to lock the bank and send blockers to the Second teams map, but there are no invasions. It's just a straight up battle against you and 3 other Guardians on your side of the map. 

You cannot directly effect Guardians on your side of the map, other than stealing motes from each other and ignoring revives (sort of like today! Lol). So loadouts that endorse high defense, quick kills and fast play would be a must. The score should be extended to 100 and enemies should spawn in a bit faster to compensate. 

When you die, you still drop all of your motes. And reviving dead Guardians on your side of the map should net you some motes in the process. 

Or

You can skip the revive, and let them make the run from the spawn area giving you more motes to gather on your own. 

Once the Primevil shows up, teams work together to kill the escorts and the boss same as before. But the team that finishes first gets extra XP and maybe a chance of getting some upgrade materials. (this gives incentive to help your ""team"" even if you haven't done well during the mote collecting phase) 

This runs for 2 rounds, giving 2 chances at being on the top of the leaderboard for your side of the Gambit match. And giving 2 chances at getting upgrade materials. 

(the more rounds you win could even increase the gear dropping from tier 1 to tier 2, but this is just an idea) 


We then track dps per Guardian during the Primevil phase, Motes deposited, Guardians resurrected and blockers sent to the Second teams map. This hopefully could be calculated into an efficiency statistic that could help select a winner of Gambit for each team, and an MVP of both.

Everyone gets drops but, both winners get some higher level legendary drops based on their score and number of rounds won. The MVP gets an extra drop.

foi9hs,Sir-Shady,New or Old Seasons?,"Okay I’m gonna say it... 

The new seasonal model isn’t great. Ever since Shadowkeep and Season of Undying launched the seasonal model has been going downhill. I understand Bungie is working with way less resources and they’re doing good for what they have but it’s not doing it for me, my clanmates, and other people I’ve talked to throughout the community. So let’s talk about some pros and cons...

The Pros: 
- The overarching storyline is great. I’m very excited to see where this goes and what implications it has for the future, for example the potential return of SIVA which I am 100% with.
- Events like saving Saint-14. This was great. We had heard about him in lore and he had been hyped up and for good reason. This is how you introduce a legendary character into the game. (Looking at you CoO)
-The weapons and new mods they’re adding are generally good. Several sundial weapons (Steelfeather, Line in the Sand, Breachlight) have found their spots in my inventory, and the Warmind Cell mods are great 

The Cons: 
-The exotic quests... Need I say more? How many exotics do I get by doing 10-20 heroic public events? 
-The disappearing lackluster activities. While Sundial improved upon Vex Offensive it wasn’t anything amazing. The final boss (Inotam?) was a fun encounter that was different which was nice 
-Theres also something else that I can’t put my finger on. No I’m not being sarcastic but I just get the feeling that there’s no life in the game. When I think about it I feel like there’s some huge gap that we’re all missing that the game could use but I really don’t know...
-we need a secret mission soon. These bring players in and hype the community. I’m a believer that we’re getting a secret mission on the Almighty to get the Collosus Minigun (perks in the database “Shield of the Collosus: Ramping up this weapon protects the user with an arc shield”)

I understand the cons list is more of my personal gripes but looking at this compared to the seasons following Forsaken it’s kind of laughable. They’re not horrible in any way based on Bungie having less resources, but they could be improved upon. 

Let’s discuss in the comments I want to hear what the rest of the community has to say. By no means am I saying “oh the game is shit now, fuck Bungie”. I’ve just been getting bored lately and I’ve been realizing how ‘dead’ the game feels.

foi55t,l3g10n_99x,Eververse? Never[again]verse maybe,"So start of the new season, I figure I like this game, been playing it a while, I wanna do something and give a little money to the game since I haven’t really ever done it before and this new seasonal armor looks sick. (For warlock and hunter, anyway). I buy a pack of silver, snag the warlock armor, the hunter armor, and the Raider Flux ornament, bc it’s badass. 

Now, here I am 2 weeks later I log in check the store to see what’s new this week and imagine my surprise when I see the new set of armor and RF ornament for brightdust.... seriously..... 2 weeks??? 

To be clear: I’m not saying I don’t want everyone to get some cool things for the game for free (real world free), I would love more cool free things. Butttt if I pay real world money to get the armor/ornaments and try to do something to give back to the game and the shit is free 2 weeks later, it kinda feels like a slap in the face. 

I want the ace and austringer ornaments as well but I won’t be buying them with silver bc as soon as I do they’ll come out for free. On the contrary, I would pay real money for a beloved ornament (or a couple others) yet that’s no where to be found, except the bright engram loot pool. If you haven’t seen the odds of it actually dropping, they’re pretty slim. It doesn’t make any sense and seems like they could care less. 

In a long time of gaming, I’ve never felt more like my voice / opinion doesn’t mean a thing.

Here are traits you could’ve put on a ritual bow.

Triple tap: imagine just for a single arrow you can have an instantly knocked arrow. Would cut down the time between firing arrows.

Fourth times the charm: essentially an alternative to ambitious assassin because it wouldn’t work on a bow.

Boxed breathing: I forget how much damage boxed breathing buffs but damn that would be sick if a bow could one tap. Would make a world of difference.

Kill clip: watch them scream

Swashbuckler: a bit overused on newer weapons but whatever there is none for bows.

Backup plan: I’m not sure if this would work like the current or previous iteration of backup plan but on a bow I would like to see this.

Clown cartridge: there is no cartridge or magazine but whatever just give us 2 arrows to fire quickly.

foh6v3,JaegerDeus,Ideas to make bows more relevant,"Point of the Stag is a perfectly fine bow.  


The issue is that bows really aren't that great. There's not much you can do with a bow that you can't do as well or better with a sniper. The bows that stand out (aside from glitched Wishender) are the exotic ones with a bit of a hook, Le Monarque and Trinity Ghoul.  


Here's a crazy idea: What if tagging somebody with a bow shot temporarily nerfed their mobility? Like having an arrow stuck in you, it'd be tough to move around. So it would reduce your run speed slightly from whatever it is with your current mobility score, maybe nerf or eliminate your double jump... it would slow the enemy down. Make it almost a support weapon, leave an enemy more vulnerable to team-shooting.

I'm just spit-balling ideas for making bows worthwhile, particularly in PVP. I just don't think they offer much right now...

Add any ideas you have.",15,1585098070,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foh6v3/ideas_to_make_bows_more_relevant/,DestinyTheGame,1

fofri6,PinoShow,Can you remove traction and make it an option for controller?,"Having to pay a 3 cost mod on every pair of boots because otherwise I feel way too slow and gimped isn't fun.
It's gotten to the point where even at around 7 sensibility if I don't have traction on I feel like I'm turning around molasse.

Sprinting and trying to turn without then is incredibly slow, and in PvP (and PvE) once you get used to it you won't turn back.

And with the reintroduction of Trials it's even more of a problem, as with a 4 cost general scavenger mod and 3 cost traction mod you can't even equip a +10 stat mod without masterworking your leg piece.

And to add insult to injury exotic boots require 3 ascendant shards to get to level 10, only allowing for mobility, discipline, resilience or strength mods.

Intellect and recovery, 2 of the most important stats in trials and PvP in general require 5 and 4 points respectively, so even if you wanted to have Intellect + traction + sniper scavenger you'd have to chose one to discard, as sniper scavenger is a 3 cost mod (also, why is shotgun scav a 2 cost mod alongside with fusion scav?)


Just make traction an option and remove the mobility bonus from it if that's what's stopping you to make that change...


It's one of the most arbitrary decision in this game: have an issue and make the player suffer to overcome it.
It's the same situation we had in D1 with sprint lock and the introduction of the Memory of Jolder artifact mod.",6,1585092802,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/fofri6/can_you_remove_traction_and_make_it_an_option_for/,DestinyTheGame,1

“Shhh, it’s alright, everything is going to be fine.” the hunter whispered to the boy. His ghost flitted around, doing his best to alleviate the boy’s pain.

“What’s your name bud?” the hunter asked.

“Drew.” the boy replied. He couldn’t have been older than eight.

“That’s a good name,” He could see the boy’s eyes starting to droop. He was drifting to unconsciousness. The hunter drew his hand cannon. 

“Where’s my mommy?” the boy asked.

“She’s in a better place. Don’t worry. You’ll be with her really soon.” Drew smiled at the hunter and the hunter smiled back. Then he was asleep. A bark of gunfire echoed through the field. He would never wake up. 

The hunter set about burying what was left of Drew, alongside the other refugees he had failed to save. Nine graves. Nine people dead because of him. Nine new notches on his armguard.

What about these weapons makes me want to grind them and use them more than the ones I already have? They are all the worst archetype of weapons in their respective classes. It would've been alot better if they all had the seraph rounds perk as an intrinsic trait on the weapons. I know alot of people are saying the weapons are good bc of the armor mods from this season and the warmind cells. Yes that is a cool synergistic mechanic on these weapons. However it would've been alot better to have that along with better traits or maybe some new traits. Or by making the weapons desirable archetypes. With sunsetting probably right around the corner, bungie needs to work on their ability to make awesome desirable weapons in this game. The trials weapons are by far the best in this season. They are all the top archetype and have good perk pools. I'm hopeful that Bungie can step it up in the loot department sooner rather than later. If september drop rolls around and we still are seeing the same issues then the future might be bleak for me and this game. I want it to succeed. I want it to be the best it can be.

foezsj,Shmen8980,Proposed fix for ticket farming,"Ok, so we know that ticket farming is a problem right now as it makes us normal players get steamrolled by sweaty try hards. So how would this be fixed? 

My proposed solution would be to lock rewards on the ticket. If you get 3 wins but you reset the ticket, you won’t get anything. The only way you would be able to claim the rewards would be to either A. Lose 3 times, or B. Go finish out your wins. 

Pros:
Sweats would either have to throw their last three matches, which would honestly work out for us since we would win more matches, or they would have to actually go the rest of the way through their tickets. 

Cons: 
Makes farming weapons slightly slower (which is how it should be anyways, these weapons are supposed to be endgame), we would run into more throwers which some people do not appreciate, and could possibly maybe increase matchmaking time

For people leveling, armor can be tough to come by, we swim in energy weapons. The only thing harder to get than a certain armor piece is a heavy weapon.. at least in my experience. Not really looking for agreement or disagreement, just a simple answer.

foe1h1,Daemon7861,My idea on how to balance the different types of Hand Cannons,"So right now, 150s are fat and away the best archetype of hand cannon in PvP. My suggestions below aim not to nerf them, but to buff the other archetypes accordingly:

140s: This one is pretty simple, just give it the ability to kill with two shots to the head, one to the body. I think previously this was frowned upon due to neutering 110s, but this is fixed below.

110s: This will sound crazy at first, but hear me out. First, decrease the range at which they do maximum damage significantly (down to 15 meters or less). Then, smoothen out the rate at which damage drops off, so that it isn’t so steep like with other Hand Cannon archetypes. Then, increase the damage to 102 per headshot. This will allow 110s to kill in two headshots, provided you can aim them well, however, they will only be able to do so within very close range (for a primary). Outside of that, they will need 3 hits to kill.

I’m open to discussion and any further suggestions, I don’t currently have any ideas for 180s, but these are just some thoughts on the other archetypes.",1,1585086783,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/foe1h1/my_idea_on_how_to_balance_the_different_types_of/,DestinyTheGame,1

They showed up as red to me and I thought, no way I am that under leveled. Turns out that they were 1013 and 1012 in IB while everyone else on their team was normalized. Took screenshots and hovered over their power level and it indeed said 1000 + 12 and 1000 + 13.

It seems like every match im in theres at least one on my team that gets error coded out.  With me it seems like its ever 2 or 3 games.  This isnt an issue that can be resolved next season, it needs to be hotfixed asap.  This problem started with season of the worthy and its just going to keep growing until something is done.

The Ana bit in the bunker was I guess enhancing some of the storyline, but I think there needs to be a bit more flesh on those bones.

fodnxy,sylverlynx,"Bungie, if this is what ""content"" has come to I think I have to bow out.","The mindless grind of the last 2 weeks afforded me enough Warmind bits to fully upgrade the Moon bunker today.  Then I paused and thought ""What does all of this allow me to do?""  

Grind ""new"" Lost Sectors?  Grind a ""new"" Seraph Tower event?  Grind bits more efficiently to dump on more redundant drops of a few drip-fed, mod-reliant weapons and boring armor?  Stretch that out for a few more months and, nah, I'll pass.

fodmer,Dhcifnebdxi1,"Destiny as a community, Destiny as a game, Destiny as a lack luster bounty grinder","Destiny was one of the first FPS games I have ever played, I started in Taken King and have played thousands of hours since. I know that this is said a lot but my friends and I have been playing together in Destiny since year 1 of destiny 2 and have all been playing since Destiny 1. While I say this like it matters I have seen everything Bungie has to offer since the best Expansion all the way to the worst. Everyone at bungie is talking about how they lost a ton of staff by splitting and are having to invest(or in some cases Not invest in certain activities) while Bungie and the community as a whole spun the split between Activision and Bungie and Activision being the bad guy, we are currently 3 seasons into Bungie’s destiny and I have to say this.

Bungie is a game studio that has been cutting corners on their content for months, bringing back old exotics is great, but bringing them back then nerfing them is literally completely ridiculous. Bungie says they are testing the game and testing guns but if you have to nerf every gun that has a semblance of imbalance then obviously they didn’t properly test the gun or the way the buffs worked
Example: OEM the reason the OEM was the best exotic for Titan was tracking. What class uses tracking? Hunters, if a Titan has tracking then was is the point of a hunter class to begin with. If you need hunter tracking/wall hacks, then give titans wall hacks then obviously that is not fair. Or balanced IDK a which studio 
Example 2: every exotic that has ever nerfed that was brought from Destiny 1 of you bring it back TEST IT, don’t just play with it for a few hours this is a fundamental flaw in the system
Ever verse: being free to play destiny needs an income base, I believe it should be ever verse or seasons, if ever verse items start costing $10 USD for one set of armor then I might as well just buy the next season, while that price is ridiculous for 4 ornaments it’s also ridiculous to pay money for something that is just requiring you to grind for 100+ hours a week to complete, to think that an event like the seraph bunkers are timegated &amp; to think there are 3 of them. I am burnt out getting the Earth bunker to level 3, not max level, level 3. COME ON

I’m going to go controversial here and say that Activision was the good guy in this situation, yes they were forcing Eververse and yes they were cutting projects for future stuff, but at the end of the day they forced Bungie to get stuff done and forced them to meet certain requirements, I have never had to grind this hard in a game that advertises being accessible to EVERYONE lemme know how you feel if you got this far... sorry

fodmd6,Nterstellardeity,"Dear Bungie, can we talk a bit about Iron Banner Matchmaking","I know you have a lot on your plate Bungie, but.. I just spent 5-6 mins matchmaking only to finally get tossed into a match where the team I joined was getting stomped 19-73. I ran in to find an opposing titan in super, I died, respawned and match was over by mercy ruling. 

As I type this, I have been 9/12 in matchmaking for well over 5 minutes. This skill-based matchmaking isn't working for me. I don't mind how sweaty the matches get but its the waiting in between matches that bothers me. 

If it's possible to look at the matchmaking, please do.
