fsof9b,Sydwase,Looking at transferring servers.,"Looking to transfer off a high population legacy server to a medium population server with available housing, preferably on a NA data center.  I’ve been on the same server since 2.0 and I’m looking for a change. The server I’m on was great for doing extreme/savage content, could fairly easily get clears with party finder, but that’s no longer a priority for me as I’m more interested in playing casually these days.  My house got demolished during a break from the game and I’m not interested in camping one again, took 13hrs of clicking last time. 

Can anyone recommend a server with a decent player base with available housing?",5,1585699061,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fsof9b/looking_at_transferring_servers/,ffxiv,1

Well recently a friend wanted me to try it with them, and I figured it might be more fun together, so sure. I obviously couldn't do another free trial on my first account (and I also couldn't remember the login at the time, but that's been resolved), so I set up another SE account under my 2ndary email.

And, after getting to lvl 35 WHM, now I'm pretty sure I want to buy the game lol. But I'd like to buy it on steam, since there's a sale on the dlc going on. I want to keep my character, though. I can't seem to get my steam account to unlink from the original though, as [it gives me an auth error](https://i.imgur.com/7ueS34V.png) (tried different browser too).

The launcher started patching, and it failed.  


I've tried changing my DNS to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) /  [8.8.4.4](https://8.8.4.4) and 209.244.0.4 / [208.244.0.4](https://208.244.0.4)

So what happened: I was doing MSQ roulette (Prae) and when we got to the suiting up part of the dungeon, one of the players was just standing next to the mech so I assumed they didn't access the panel at the bottom of the lift. So I let the person know and told them step by step what they needed to do to progress.

A few people from my FC then started telling me that what I did was somehow ""toxic"" and ""bm"" following up with stuff like;' ""if someones wrong you just leave them be"", ""if you try to teach someone it comes off as bm"" and ""until they mention that they're lost, that's when you help"". Their logic was that some people have been banned for taking the initiative to help someone and that its ""japanese etiquette"".

I have a tremendous fear of letting the debate down which leads me to never even attempting it in the first place. I haven't done any difficult content in FFXIV since my last static in 2014 with T1-T5.  

what is it like doing the pickup group in Savage content for new players?  Is voice chat typically a mandatory?  How forgiving are groups when it comes to people messing with mechanics people they are new to them?

My current gear situation is mostly HQ ilvl 480 crafted gear, with a few pieces of 490 tomestone gear, and I'm maxing my 450 tomestones every week to slowly upgrade this bit by bit. 

Materia wise I got to a comfortable SkS and then maxed crit.

I'm not in a position to do savage or ultimate content, as I don't have the time or flexibility to find a static and I definitely don't wanna be a drag in party finder by not having the time to practice.

Now, as a former WoW transplant (mostly during vanilla) the saying was that once you hit max level you could ""finally start playing the game"". Which, in hindsight speaks more to a poor leveling experience and less about the endgame.

Anyway, I just got through my first dungeon and... omg I’m exhausted. It felt like I was trying to wade through all the visual stimuli to figure out where my next pull was going to be coming from, and thank god I had an aoe attack to fall back on because I couldn’t tell you where one enemy ended and the other began - let alone tracking where the hell my teammates were. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to get rid of some of the unnecessary visuals? I’d love to go for a minimalist vibe where only the ABSOLUTE essential information was shown, but I have no idea where I would even start.

fryqzp,ComebacKids,Class Popularity Statistics - Make Your Bets!,"Over the last couple of months I've been keeping track of which classes people are playing. Very simply, I log how often different classes show up in my parties. 

I've seen things like the FFXIV Census: https://ffxivcensus.com/ but don't think it really reflects class popularity in terms of what people are playing for dungeons/trials/raids. 

Also, the statistics I'm keeping are from me doing daily roulettes and story dungeons as I progress (finished Stormblood last night!), so this isn't like fflogs which tracks the most popular classes in endgame raids. My data simply reflects which classes people are choosing to play when they do non-endgame stuff.

I'm planning to compile all this data, create some nice graphics, and post it here next weekend - but I'm interested to see which classes people *think* are the most played versus which classes actually *are* the most played. Seeing how player sentiment matches up with reality could be a cool statistic all on its own. 

Anyways, what I'd like you the reader to do is: 

1. rank the DPS classes in order of popularity

2. rank the healer classes in order of popularity

3. rank the tank classes in order of popularity",21,1585600663,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fryqzp/class_popularity_statistics_make_your_bets/,ffxiv,1

Basically Lalafell are drawing me in for a number of reasons

1. Their design makes me think of old old old school Final Fantasy, with the little sprite characters. 

2. I think all armor looks super cool on them. 

3. Plainsfolk are generally outgoing and talk a lot, which I relate to on a spiritual level, boi. 

My concern is probably stemming from how gnomes are treated in WoW. They’re a joke race, at best. I don’t even wanna get into what the worst case scenario is for them. What’s the general... I guess “feeling” towards Lalafell in FFXIV? I also plan to RP, if that helps.

frrdvg,Syzygian,Living Shadow Question,"I haven't played in a while - I see Living Shadow has an actual potency listed now.   


This potency doesn't make sense though - If LS' attack potency is 300, it should be doing roughly the same as combo'ed Syphon Strikes. For me, LS always does about 10K and some change per attack, while my Syphon Strikes do about 2K less (8.3-8.7K) in spite of also being 300 potency.   


So my question is simply why is this? Does LS calculate damage differently? I remember it being a meme to call it a DoT - but does the game consider it to **actually** be a DoT in terms of, say, skill speed?  


Or is the tooltip simply wrong? I've read people saying that it is actually 400 potency, which would make more sense - that's not what the tooltip says though, and several minor hotfix/pseudo-patches have come and gone since I started playing again where they could've fixed stuff like that.

frno40,SideShow117,Starter lvl50 gear?,"Hi all,

**To start with the question:**

Is there any starter lvl50 gear you can easily buy with some Gil or very easy currencies to obtain some armor/weapons that at least brings you up to around Ilvl50 so i can properly continue the MSQ and do some entry lvl50 dungeons?

**Background:**

I've been scouring all over for some tips where to start around with lvl50 gear. I've found plenty of guides and all but they specify the end-gear route for ARR (which are good guides!) but they don't really fit the bill what i'm asking. My apologies if i overlooked something.

With the insane XP boosts you're getting from ""Road to 70"" and the Preferred server, I'm about to hit lvl50 but i'm barely on the lvl35 quests in the MSQ. I've already leveled two other jobs to lvl40ish continueing the MSQ when i can do them on the alts but it's honestly getting a little extreme.

Because of this insane progress, my armor and weapons are an absolute mess. I'm running around with lvl20 armor slaying lvl40 monsters which is honestly not ideal, and especially in Dungeons it's starting to become a real problem.

The guides and information start from the ilvl70 gear and assume you have a natural progression with around an ilvl of 50 when you've reached lvl50. Due to the insane XP, this is no longer true.

Therefore the normal route is ""blocked""

* GC gear and up (i barely have seals, cannot buy the endgame due to rank requirements).
* Ironworks gear (I cannot get the tomes because the ilevel is too low to start the required dungeons)
* etc.

Hope this question makes sense, thanks!",28,1585560700,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/frno40/starter_lvl50_gear/,ffxiv,1

I know now that i am having major issues with weaving I knew what weaving was but have been doing it wrong. I also see that i need to work on my DoT upkeep but not doing it to early, i also see that i need to work on keeping things such as divine benison on CD. If anyone can help me with advice I would really appreciate it, especially when it comes to weaving because i know i should be dpsing when healing isnt needed but my weaving is horrible so any and all advice on that topic would truly be helpful.

Im leaving links to both the logs and my character so if anyone can help they can take a quick look and tell me what im doing wrong.

frn4c3,Edartle,Healing in Stormblood (and potentially shadowbringers),"Hello, I am currently a level 68 scholar (I started playing a few weeks ago) going through the MSQ and for the most part I have been having a great time. In order to get to level 69, I have been spamming Doma Castle, and have run into a bit of trouble. The tanks during this dungeon have been doing a pull that takes all of the mobs from the big armor guy to the trio before the first boss. What has happened all but one time follows:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I put down sacred soil
2. I use excogitation on the tank
3. I spam physick a bit then lustrate after the excog goes off
4. I use dissipate and continue to lustrate 
5. Everyone dies

&amp;#x200B;

I usually use whispering dawn in there somewhere before dissipate, though I did forget a few times. The everyone dies step usually comes after I have run out of aetherflow stacks and all the mobs are still alive, but sometimes before if I was stupid enough to try using art of war instead of physick and I run out of aetherflow stacks really fast because the tank is taking so much damage. My main question here is whether I am missing something, should I be able to heal through all this damage at my level/ ilevel? I have full doma castle gear at this point, but when I first got to the dungeon people were dying even faster. Sometimes this is not a problem, the tank just doesnt do as big a pull and we move on. Other times I have been flamed and asked if I knew what I was doing (and if I was even using heal skills?) and this has been fairly discouraging and made me seriously consider whether or not I should keep playing as a healer, even though I enjoyed it immensely up until Stormblood. I figure that this sort of trend will continue into Shadowbringers, I have no delusions there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, I wanted to ask why it is so much harder to heal through these adds than it is to heal through the boss because that is what initially caught me really off guard. In earlier dungeons I never really had any problems, but I usually had to do a lot more healing during the bosses than I did during the adds between bosses. But during these Stormblood dungeons I frantically try to keep the tank alive during the adds and then the bosses are all snoozefests where I spam broil and occasionally excog the tank or succor the dps. It just seems backwards, Idk.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the somewhat stream of consciousness, I have just been really caught off guard by these newer dungeons and was hoping a few more veteran healers/ tanks had some advice for me.",48,1585557596,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/frn4c3/healing_in_stormblood_and_potentially/,ffxiv,1

frk4ce,sciencecomic,"Gave the game another try. Long rant, but in the end, I think I'm enjoying the ride!","Preface: I first tried FF14 when there was a free period before the big Reborn re-launch. Not gonna lie, I hated it. But since then, everybody I know plays it. So it constantly kept me wondering.

Flash forward to quarantine. I've been getting an MMO itch, but WoW is in a weird place, and I don't really have the budget for a monthly sub right now because haha no work. But somebody on that subreddit said ""I'll be playing FF14"". So I grabbed the free trial. 

I was mostly interested in gunbreaker, because I've also had a serious ""I need a certain amount of gunslingers in every game I play now"" itch as well. But since they're a shadowbringers class, I figured I'd play rogue like I usually do. 

Folks, it's been rough. I spent most of the time thinking ""I should just play WoW"" because of how clumsy the actual rogue part of the class is. What is up with stealth? And getting yoinked out of it on boss pull??? I've pretty much taken Hide and Tricky Strike off my bars. I unlocked Ninja today and thank god it seems really cool. If I can't play as Roland Deschain in an RPG, I'll take fucking Naruto.

Are all the starter classes so bland? Since I'm capped at 35 for now, I figured I'd level another class/job like Dragoon. Or maybe finish off my monk since I have a lvl 20 pugilist. 

The combat, interface, and design is still super weird to me, but you read it here, it kept me hooked. I want to keep going. I haven't even touched crafting yet. I feel like there's still so much to do even in this trial period. I'd love to hear what folks think of my weird experience with this game.

**TL;DR** This game is bonkers, and I'm still looking at it funny. But I just put in a whole weekend of gametime and I'm still curious for more.

Thanks for reading this as I decompress and reflect on the game. Any classes you folks like? Machinists seem cool too, I like the Wildstar Spellslinger/Engineer feel they have. Sadly I don't think I have access to them right now.",22,1585542032,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/frk4ce/gave_the_game_another_try_long_rant_but_in_the/,ffxiv,1

frjwdm,GrizZ_09,Help me pick a main!,"hey y’all,

i’ve been leveling as summoner which i’ve been having fun with. visually though, i really like how bards look (but also summoners are neat too). i’ve always played casters/ranged in WoW and raided mythic.

i know i’ll eventually end up playing both but i guess i want to know which is more wanted in raids and are more likely to get a spot? i want to know because i really want to focus on one class and put the majority of effort into that class until i feel comfortable leveling different ones.

i know this game is way different and everything is viable but i want to pick a class as my first one where i know i’m more likely to get a spot if i can execute and play well.

this may be a stupid question so sorry in advance but any insight would really help.

frehky,NexzuisZS,Charter customizations really need an update. Please up vote so we can hopefully get it soon.,"So I have been doing some fantasia's and used about 4 on my characters. Spending some time in the creation screen. We really need some more options. Like the faces, a butt slider, maybe even sliders for legs etc. 

I have played a lot of MMO's and I have seen some great customisation adding a slider for everything, really brining uniqueness to your character. 

Now I have to compliment the game on the glamours and gear, emotes etc. But please Yoshi add a butt slider ans some more, faces and other sliders. It is really starting to feel dated., Also some more hairstyles etc.

Anyway I love the game. Just really would like more detailed customisation. Sliders in the place of fixed choices for noses, mouths and Jaws. MORE faces and a butt slider. Man the butts are like no where, but you stare at it all day 🤣

It helps with the immersion for me.

I got all of my crafters to 50 except culinarian and I had a blast!!! Now that I’m working on getting all of my battle classes to 50, I’m not having that much fun...

Almost every party I get in DF, at least one person is disrespectful, ie. running ahead and pulling, ignoring mechanics (I know some are acceptable), just making another role’s job harder in general. It’s honestly really exhausting getting party after party like that.

I’m sad because I really hope I’m just having terrible luck and this isn’t really what the community is like as a whole. :( I wish people would realize and think about how there are new players every day, playing/learning classes and doing dungeons for the first time.

So I turn to you, fellow redditers. If you had to pick, what would be your nominations for the most thematic abilities for each job? Let's say max 3 per job.

For me: 

DRG is easy. Jump in it's various forms. That, and using spears/polearms.

BLM is all about the explosions. Big flashy elemental spells dealing damage.

I've been playing on my free trial account and recently decided to buy the Shadowbringers PC download off Square Enix website (not Steam). I first encountered an issue with checking out my purchase while logged into my Square Enix account. The check out box would not appear unless I logged out of my Square Enix account and just checked out as a guest (lost member points that way. Not happy about that). Customer support seems to be down temporarily so I am not getting any help from them. I went ahead and purchased Shadowbringers as a guest and received my game code via email. Now I am at the point where I'm trying to input the game code into the Mog station but I keep getting a invalid error message. I double checked all characters to make sure it wasn't a simple mistake of putting a 0 instead of an O. Still not working. It states that when I buy the Shadowbringers xpac it includes Heavensward and Stormblood (no mention of Realm Reborn). I'm left believing I need to buy Realm Reborn and to transfer my trail account to an full account before I can input my Shadowbringers game code?

My setup is very annoying in a dungeon since I use the QWER keys with control and shift. This makes it hard to move around using abilities because when I press shift or control, my character abruptly stops moving.

I was wondering if anyone here had some ideas for a Gunbreaker hotbar? I tried finding some examples but I sadly didn't find anything that fit my playstyle. I am using a full-sized keyboard.

I've downloaded the trial version of the game and started a mage. I'm currently at level 5.

I love the music, animations, general art style, and I like tab targeted MMOs. 

However, so far I've found the game in general to be mind numbingly boring. I'm just running around from one npc to the next, occasionally fighting. I can't even read the dialogue anymore because I'm just too bored with it. I find it very tedious.

Does this change? Is it worth pushing through? I like to fight in these games, not read a bunch of quest text for hours. I don't mind reading, but I'm not a fan of reading in video games  It would be much better for me if it were voice acted. The combat seems really slow as well. 

Not trying to attack the game or people who play it. I just want to know if this is going to get any better or if you guys think I should cut my losses. 

my favorite MMOs are/were Shadowbane, DAOC, Warhammer Online for reference. I liked WoW before WOTLK as well.

fqu6zb,GreasyBud,MSQ for ARR is Terrible. Like game breaking bad.,"Im not talking about the story (which isn't that great to begin with but personal preference is a thing).

*but the gameplay*

oh. my. god.

my friends and i just started the game last week. we are all quarantined this week, so we figured we'd bust out a new MMO.

and we love the game. the combat is great, dungeons are great, and theres tons of content that we havent done yet but are exited to get into.

but oh my god. we have to teleport to one guy, talk to him, teleport back, kill a guy, teleport back, turn in a piece of meat, repeat.

we are on the AAR 2.0-2.5 grind and my friends are about to quit the game. 

with the ""road to 70"" buff we are all 54-56, and still have 96 more of these quests to do. 

ive been told the story/gameplay gets better with heavensward, but like, i dont know if we can even make it there at this rate.

theres no real point doing dungeons, fates, or anything because we cant actually progress to the new content without the MSQ progressed.

It is utterly *insane* to me that this is what is expected of new players. 

we dont want to buy the skip because we want to actually want to level up and learn how the game works (and i actually do want to see the story of the other expantions) 

but we are just so... demoralized...

fqrpyb,Tkwan777,Mini rant on BLM,"Why is BLM so confusing to play? None of the other casters are anything close to this amount of micro management. Just about every level range changes something intrinsic on how you dps for the class. There's just so much to focus on as a BLM. You have to watch umbral/astral and make sure they don't fall off, keep an eye on your enochian, polyglot charges, thunder dot, thunder and fire procs, watch your mp, time your ley lines to match with boss mechanics, triple cast and manafont properly, and then while doing all of that, do boss mechanics properly. 

Even AOE is a pain. Why do we have to cast single target skills to move into aoe skills? Why can't they just give fire 2 and freeze some decent potency so we can actually combo those with flare/foul. 

Speaking of the lower level fire skills, why does only fire/ice 3 refresh the astral/umbral, but fire/ice 1 clears them? 


The black mage is just a completely chaotic class. I get that the point of black magic is controlling chaos, but it doesn't translate well to a fluid fun game play. 

In my opinion, the micromanagement needs to be decreased, or the BLM just needs to be made into a magic fortress where it can survive most mechanics while focusing almost entirely on its kit.


Feel free to disagree with me. I have many classes at 80, but I'm just a newby BLM, and these are my thoughts on it as a fresh lvl 80.",25,1585426907,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fqrpyb/mini_rant_on_blm/,ffxiv,0

fqq964,ShadesGuide,(SG) Battle Voices Videos + Update on Things to Come!,"# What the hell is ""Shade's Guide""?

What’s up, guys. My name is Shade and I make super in-depth guides and helpful videos for FFXIV.

My biggest guide (by far) is the **crafter leveling guide** on my website. Here’s what it looks like:

[Covers leves \/ Ishgardian Restoration for all crafting jobs Lv 1\~80](https://preview.redd.it/wujdmcap6gp41.png?width=2540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98711a41c3225ef04e992b35e70ad4607eb1041f)

(This post isn’t really about this guide, so if you’re interested in leveling up your crafters, please check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/elx3ub/sg_v30_complete_guide_to_crafter_leveling_leves/) I made back in January—it has a ton of info about this guide!)

&amp;#x200B;

Two weeks ago, I uploaded a **video guide on the System Configuration menu** ([Youtube video link](https://youtu.be/9mDkGbcoti8)). It's gotten some very nice feedback, and, since then, I’ve been busy as hell with more Youtube things.

&amp;#x200B;

My upload schedule is **every Saturday at 9AM PST**, but I didn’t actually upload a video last week due to some major technical difficulties (in OBS / Premiere) that have since all been completely ironed out.

(After all of these little issues, I’m definitely going to make a video about settings in OBS / Premiere and Youtube compression in the future...)

&amp;#x200B;

# New Video(s)

Since I didn’t upload anything last week, I stayed up all night so that I could upload **two** videos today.

[Youtube video link](https://youtu.be/MXkOzje65a4):

[They SOUND as burly as they look... mostly!](https://preview.redd.it/9nlc3z6z6gp41.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=81699983ffe8a771592e7992bab2553056382f95)

[Youtube video link](https://youtu.be/JmbPLgs--tM):

[I spent WAY too long in gpose for this thumbnail](https://preview.redd.it/qbsoht607gp41.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af44c9f2e7fb4c27362b60fac0ba0a38d50cbc7a)

These videos are much simpler than my System Configuration menu video, but I think they would be very helpful to people interested in making (or fantasia’ing to) a fem Roe or a Viera anytime soon. (You hear combat voices constantly when fighting, but there’s no way to preview (in-game) what those voices actually sound like without actually making new characters and fighting.)

I’ll be covering other races (**cat ladies are next**) in the coming weeks. If there’s a particular race/gender you’d like me to cover sooner, please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I’ll be making **another massive guide video**—on the **Character Configuration menu**. That video is going to take at least **a few weeks** to make, and these smaller videos help me keep the new channel growing in the mean time. (The Almighty Algorithm **demands** consistent uploads.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, that’s what I’ve been up to!

…That, and Animal Crossing! &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

PS – Now that all of the video recording / editing technical issues are taken care of, I can finally get to updating my crafter leveling guide (and my website). Sorry it’s taken me so long!

&amp;#x200B;

PPS – Totally off-topic, but **FAR MORE IMPORTANT** than anything else in this entire post: If you aren’t already... GET HEALTHY IMMEDIATELY!!

Take some vitamins! Eat right! GET PLENTY OF SLEEP (not like me)! Do what you have to do to keep your immune system strong AF through all of this shit!

&amp;#x200B;

As always, if you have any questions / comments / suggestions / whatever about any of this stuff, please let me know!

&amp;#x200B;

And seriously… take your vitamins!

 **Frequently Asked Questions**

*“What is Rival Wings?”*

Rival Wings is a large-scale PvP battle with powerful goblin-made war machina involving up to 48 combatants. Participants are divided into two teams “The Falcons” and “The Ravens” both comprised of six light parties each.

The first team to destroy the core located on the opponent's base will be declared the winner.

*“How do I unlock Rival Wings?”*

Players can unlock the mode “Hidden Gorge” by completing the quest “Earning Your Wings” which can be obtained from the NPC Softknox at the Wolves' Den Pier (players must be at least level 30 and have unlocked a job to start the quest).

*“What are the rewards for participating?”*

Players will receive EXP, Wolf Marks, and Allagan Tomestones for participating. Those who emerge victorious in Rival Wings campaigns earn double the reward along with achievements that reward unique titles and special mounts.",9,1585415013,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fqnz7c/revival_wings_gathering_hidden_gorge_3282020/,ffxiv,10
fqnurs,k2i3n4g5,Hotbar Help Please,"Hey all, so this isn't that big a deal but it would be handy. For stuff like Role actions I want them to be on the same hotkeys between jobs so that I always know where they are and don't have to shift thinking between jobs. I also have all my Tanks ranged move on the same hotkey but I'm guessing that will have to be checked manually. So my question is does anyone know an easy way to copy moves between job hotbars, like a macro or something so that I know Rampart is always on the same hotkey for example. It's just annoying jumping between jobs to keep double checking lol",4,1585414612,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fqnurs/hotbar_help_please/,ffxiv,0

&amp;#x200B;

it was a super fancy piece, very official-looking, using the pencil-y/watercolor style that a lot of the official event illustrations have. It depicted a ceremony of eternal bonding ending (i think?) and had a wedding couple on the big wedding chocobo. There was a lot of lace.

fqe576,brianx2000,Static diamond frost strat (w/ clips this time),"Finally tested and works surprisingly well. This strat uses fixed positions puddle positions for each player (clock spots basically) which means it's near impossible to screw up puddle placement. For uptime, these puddle placements are barely out of melee range, and the party's safe spot is directly in the center under the boss. Only the healer flare needs to get knocked out to a cardinal.

&amp;#x200B;

Help us fight off the phishing scammers who prey on players.

&amp;#x200B;

For some time now, there have been phishing scams using similar official URLs on twitch, youtube, etc.

Since 3/16, they've been doing bad things on twitter this time.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The URL is very suspicious.

You'd think no one would fall for such an apparent trap.

However, there are some people who get stuck.

Please tell your friends about it.

There is a flip side to these sweet words.

I understand that you want to take it easy, but it's not fun.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Their modus operandi is shouting out twitter URLs in the game.

After a while, I will delete the twitter post.

So, even if you have your twitter URL reported in-game, you may not be able to check it later.

So, if you can tell us both the twitter URL and the suspicious URL, it will help us to eliminate them.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Please cooperate with us in reporting scammers and spoofing on twitter.

&amp;#x200B;

These kind of things happen if you've been playing FF for nearly 7 years! (O\_o) So in case you too have a screenshot problem\* try this script! You can even setup another script to run *this* script every time you start FF14. :)

^(\*(which is mostly just a problem because it takes so long to dig thru everything and find the one you want to see again))

    @echo off
    set year=%date:~10,4%
    set month=%date:~4,2%
    set day=%date:~7,2%
    set today=%date:~10,4%-%date:~4,2%-%date:~7,2%

    if not exist %year%\%month% mkdir %year%\%month%
    if not exist %year%\%month%\%day% mkdir %nowdir%
    mv *.png %nowdir%

Put that in your screenshot folder and run it as needed. Maybe a weird post that fits better on Stackoverflow or something, but hopefully that will help someone. :)

fq9t36,Justjeff777,I genuinely almost like everything about this game after 1+ year except two things. Gear ( stats/materia ) and skill rotation.,"I have tried alot of MMO's and this the fourth one i genuinly enjoy and put alot of time in. First on to pay a sub, second one i pay a monthly fee ( f2p but usefull perks ). I will leave the names out of the other MMO's.

FF XIV is a great game. Story, msq, sidequests, dungeons, FC, raids and whatever. I love the Savage modes and it feels nice to clear all eden Savages ( 5 to 8 ) on a night once or twice a week ( besides corona i got others things to do like most ). Strats, boss mech, trying new ways to boost dps uptime etc. All fun.

But here is where i get a bit annoyed. After talking with several people in game, on discord, forum, youtube, guides etc. I cant find anything in regards of a softcap on stats or different type of possible rotation.

For the stats/gear. If you take the average lvl 80 SMN for example ( since i am focusing on it now ) with BiS and melding at least 90% will have the same stats. You can always try to tweak here and there to your own liking but the margine is thin. Doing other type of stats will harm your damage output alot so you are almost forced to be the same stat wise as the other SMNers out there. No way to play/try something different without screwing yourself or your party. 

I wish there a softcap so you experiment on maxing crit or maxing skill speed to see how it goes. If anyone has this info somewhere ( not the x point means 0.0x% crit ) of possible softcaps i would be delighted as i feel i am not able to creat a different playstyle. 



The same goes for rotation and skills. The way the skills work you are forced to use a certain rotation or skill followup to 1 specific skill. You can not use different combo's, try to mix it up etc. You must always use a certain skill to use the other one for the best ( or the normal/usual ) amount of damage.

By a death, interrupting and whatever your rotation can be salvaged later on but you lose so much dps. Not because you suck but your rotation is out of wack for a few seconds.

Also trying to do something different somehow people notice during Savage i am doing it, i dont even wanna know how the fuck they do that, give comments, get angry, ' there is already a SMN rotation. Look it up.'


TL:DR. Your forced to use the same stats on gear and same rotation as others playing the same class. Makes it monotone and is kinda ruining it for me as you cant try new things.

Is there perhaps some strategy or trick I'm missing? My DRK is lvl 64, and I only just finished the initial Heavensward story (hoping the post-game isn't as long as ARR's before I can jump into Stormblood, and eventually Shadowbringers).

As much as it pains me, I'm wondering if I just need to abandon the notion of even getting the original Dark Knight gear, or at least until I finish Shadowbringers, which is likely to be several months from now.

fq9iwb,TosinABossSi,Why are ninjas so weak?,"Games never get the concept of ""glass cannon"" high risk/high reward characters correct. Ninjas are supposed to be execution heavy high cpm type jobs. There's also the risk of messing up a mudra, though it becomes almost a non-issue with enough practice, still the risk is there, and when it happens, it's very detrimental to your damage output. There's too much work for relatively little payoff as a ninja compared to other jobs.  

SAMs are so much easier compared to other jobs, and they are amongst god tier dps, undoubtedly the top 3 highest dps jobs alongside with SMN and BLM.

I also don't really understand why summoners are so strong as well, maybe someone can enlighten me on this since I don't have a summoner. But please be absolutely honest and explain without sugarcoating, and saying something along the lines of ""because muh main class, it's obv the hardest to play"".

Black mages, I can understand.

fq8s2x,mpajovin,Question about Cure III,"Hi!

I have got Cure III the other day and I think I have a problem with it. Maybe I'm just don't understanding how it works.

In essence, when I use cure I or cure II to another target I can see the green numbers appearing on the screen with the amount of life I have cured.

But, even if I'm just should to shoulder with the target, Cure III doesn't do anything. I have tried with the same target all the cures and they worked except for cure III.

I know it is an Aoe spell, and that I have to take into account the radious, that is way I tried to do it very close to the target, but no matter what i tried, it doesn't do anything.

Also, if I cast Cure III to myself it works, my life increase and I can see the green number. It only cures me, but at least it does something.

Someone knows if I'm doing something wrong? I mean, obviously there is something (probably stupid) that I'm not getting.

fq7013,Zenthon127,"Auto-demolition timer being shut down is a great move, but it's gonna make existing housing problems on non-JP servers infinitely worse","Let me preface this by saying I am no longer in the housing race.  I got my Small on 5.2 launch day and have no plans to upgrade soon (not that I even *could* until Ishgard launch).  But regardless, I sympathize with the players that want to get into the market......because they can't.

Previously, at least here on Aether there was a small influx of properties every week that would go up for sale due to auto-demolition (at least outside of like, Gilg).  Outside of new wards this was your *only* shot at getting a house - the 2-to-5 smalls a week that would be available at random.  With housing demolition gone, there are no houses.

Let me put into perspective how bad this actually is.  I'm on Midgardsomr.  We're on the smaller end for Aether, with Preferred status atm, but we're still in the realm of a medium-size server.  RP presence is virtually nonexistent.  We're far from a Gilgamesh or Balmung housing nightmare server; getting a small was a difficult but reasonable goal.  But we're already at very near capacity, with no more than a handful of smalls available at any given time.  There is exactly *one* open plot on this server right now, a small in the Goblet.  Once that sells (within the next 12 hours, likely) there will be *zero purchasable housing* for the next several months.  The entirety of Aether will be at this point probably within a week, two at max if Adamantoise is particularly slow.

Please SE.  Non-JP servers needed more wards or instanced housing already, but the timer shutdown just turned the situation from bad to actually, legitimately broken.",10,1585346904,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fq7013/autodemolition_timer_being_shut_down_is_a_great/,ffxiv,1

fq52sa,AzureXanyr,Hrothgar Naming Conventions Thought,"I know how the Hrothgar name themselves with the surname. The Helions saying that they are in service to a Queen, the Lost saying that they are no longer in service/Lost their Queen. My question/topic of discussion is multi-fold, in a sense.

TL;DR Version: Could a Hrothgar's Queen be a different race from himself, and if so, depending on the circumstances that create this situation, could a Lost call himself a Helion once again? Would the new Queen's forename be used as the Hrothgar's surname, as in Hrothgar custom?

Full Discussion, and detailed thoughts, version:
Does the Queen absolutely HAVE to be a Hrothgar? Like, for (insert reasons here) could a Hrothgar have a female of a different Race as his ""Queen"" and therefore use her name as his Surname? Compounding on this with two related questions if the answer is 'yes': If a Lost was to claim another race as his Queen, could he then, by Hrothgar conventions, consider himself a Helion again?
Using one of my own characters as an example for my next question. My main is a Seeker of the Sun Miqo'te named A'riaki Tohka. In Seeker naming convention, her actual given name is Riaki, with the A denoting what tribe she originates from. So if (my Hrothgar) was to pledge himself to her as his Queen, would he take Ariaki as his surname or Aa'riaki, as it seems that people outside Miqo'te culture don't know their names' full meaning?
To be clear, I'm not exactly planning to do this with my characters. At least not the idea of mine being in service to mine own. Maybe a friend's character or an NPC? I'm just curious if I could reasonably call ym character Helion if he doesn't have a Hrothgar Queen, but instead a Queen of a different race.",7,1585341159,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fq52sa/hrothgar_naming_conventions_thought/,ffxiv,1

Quick question.

Does this mean there’s still some mystery over the optimal route for samurai, and there’s room to make it your own? If so, how would the rotation vary?

I've always wanted to give an MMO a honest and dedicated try. One thing that bothers me though, is that on top of the fact that I'm scared I won't be able to make friends playing the game(especially as I have no friends irl who play this game), that it will be even harder to do so on PS4 if I don't have a keyboard to chat with.

Wow, what a journey! I started FF14 last April (for the third time after two brief attempts to get into it some years earlier) after chatting with some friends about playing it. I don't think I ever really expected to stick with it, and certainly not to see my way through three expansions, but here I am. From dragonboi to catboi. What an awesome game.

FF14 saw me through a lot of stress and upheaval last year, as I moved across the country to start a new job in a city with my partner.  It's been something my friends and I can always chill out on, and I have to say, after not giving a *single shit* about the storytelling in ARR, I've been enraptured with the narrative from Heavensward onward.

Now that I'm through Shadowbringers, though I have a bit of catching up left to do with the patch content, I can finally dive fully into my favorite part of the game: *wasting all of my gil on fashion*.",6,1585318084,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpxj8x/from_start_to_finish_just_under_a_year/,ffxiv,1

fpx0bl,lerdnir,"I thought you might get a kick out of my Monster Hunter guild card - my """"RDM"""" Hunter, and my Palico dressed in the Moogle costume from the XIV Behemoth crossover. I think it's Vercool!","Hi - I hope this is ok for me to post here. I had a skeg of the rules and I don't *think* I'm crossing a line, but if I am, I do apologise! Lmk.

[Anyway, as the per title, this is my guild card in Monster Hunter World.](https://i.imgur.com/fgCUPyK.jpg) I thought you might want to see.

For context: you might recall there was a crossover event between XIV and MHW that added Rathalos to the former and Behemoth to the latter. You could get some cool equipment in MHW as a result - an insect glaive (basically a vaulting pole with a bug friend) and armour set that I'm to understand looks like the Dragoon artifact equipment (I lean more towards DoM classes and am only passingly familiar with ""lol DRG"" memes; ie, I've never had much cause to find out, and I've never seen a ""wild"" XIV DRG, so... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ), and a costume for your AI-controlled cat buddy that makes it look like the XIV version of a Moogle - it floats around, and the usual mewling voice clips are replaced with bubbly ""kilo"" noises and everything.

Behemoth is designed for multiplayer, or can be soloed by players better than I, and I don't play enough MP to justify shelling out for PS+, except for XIV, which (as you know) is subbed to directly (though I hit the trial level cap and haven't activated my ""Complete"" Edition yet - I want to get the most out of my free month and I've not had the time, but I've been instructed to stay in quarantine for my own safety until at least June, so maybe now's the time...). 

Anyway! As I've not beaten Behemoth, I'm missing some key materials rewarded on successful quest completion that are needed to make the DRG armour. However, I did get enough mats to make the Moogle costume for my cat friend, through part breaks, shiny drops, and a specialist tool for the cat friend that lets you steal mats even if you fail the quest.  

There's also an armour set you can make by defeating enough monsters in the arena - for the arena quests, you can't take your own equipment or items, and have to pick from one of five preset loadouts, which might not offer weaoon classes you're any good with. The armour you get to craft is called the Brigade armour, and, you can also unlock an additional version that functions kinda like a Glamour! Admittedly, in its default state, it's, iirc, black with gold trim and beige linings. But that's where armour pigments come in! I thought it was the right shape to pass for an RDM outfit, so I dyed it red! I thus present this to you here, and I hope you like it!

**TL;DR:** A friend on Siren got a kick out of my MHW guild card ft. an ""RDM"" and a Moogle, and I hope you do too!

I've rambled on long enough, so if you've put up with me for this long, thank you for reading, and I hope you have a nice day!

fpwdl9,BubbaKushFFXIV,Can the Savage PUG Community Please Stop Adding New Strategies.,"Can we please just pick a single strategy for each fight? Trying to learn multiple strategies for the same fight is ridiculous and is partly attributing to why PF groups can suck hard.

Last night there were several PFs up telling everyone that Ilya and Forsaken LR strats are garbage and everyone should do uptime.

This shit needs to fucking stop.

You want to know why people suck at LR? It's cause they need to remember 2 different strats and now you wanna add a third?

Look I get it, uptime is probably really good for your parse but I don't care about parses when it comes to just getting my weekly clear , book, and loot. It doesn't matter if you kill the boss 30 seconds earlier or kill it at the last second, a clear is a clear.

At this point in the raid tier the average raider at E8S should be at least i490 with a i500 weapon. DPS should not be an issue where we need to use these uptime strats just to get our weekly clear.

If you want to utilize a new uptime strat to boost your parse then create a parse/speedrun group. Don't try to confuse more players by adding another strategy, you are just making everything worse then it already is.",64,1585313419,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpwdl9/can_the_savage_pug_community_please_stop_adding/,ffxiv,1

So last night, while we were progging E8S, our ST got DC-ed midway into add phase (maybe around round 3 of adds). He was holding the top aggro before the phase transition because we needed to swap after Double Slap. When we got back, we broke the boss until we reached Mirror 5 part (gaze mirrors). You can check it our clip [here](https://www.facebook.com/685204951662303/videos/530461507897660/) until Wyrm's Lament. (Advance apologies for it being on Facebook, to those who might now like the platform.)

Unfortunately, we weren't able to exploit this to reach clear because: 1) our ST was registered as disconnected from the game during Mirror 5, so aggro turned to me at a bad moment; and 2) most of our static has only seen until Mirror 4 (knockback mirror).",0,1585274986,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpoot2/we_broke_e8s_boss_last_night/,ffxiv,1

fpo0fe,FoolishYoungling,Twitch viewership,"I'm new to this game, and community (which I've seen this game has a lot of) is probably the most important part that keeps me wanting to grind out a mmo. It's a big factor into why I maxed on OSRS. When I look at WoW and OSRS twitch viewership, both seem to have passed their ""prime"" but both pull a bunch of viewership for around a week with new content. 

I understand that OSRS also has a guy called B0aty carrying their game on twitch, and WoW always has 1 or 2 people with 1k+ viewers playing their game when Asmongold isn't live. Still, their current viewership (especially WoW) is a lot higher than FFXIV on twitch. In fact, I never see FFXIV in the top 20 viewed games. 

So why is that? Why does this game that is so much fun, is heavily community driven, growing and expanding, and now a top 3 MMORPG (for now and seemingly a long time ahead) not seen as good content to absorb on streaming?",8,1585272364,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpo0fe/twitch_viewership/,ffxiv,1

fpkvv8,Mambouna,Are we the baddies?,"So I'm playing through the free trial right now and don't want to bore you too much, so here's what's up.  
Are we the bad guys?  
Two examples from the last few hours of play:  
1. The dungeon in the Ul'dah region has the players quelling the rampage of giants set free from a long sealed cave. Here's the problem. The people who contract the player to kill off the giants are the descendants of the company that colonialism-style enslaved the giants with brutal mind-control to work the mines for them. Then, when the giants rebelled, they made the mines collapse, trapping the giants in the deep for three hundred years.  
And now, hundreds of years later, the company wants to reopen the mine and because the long trapped giants who were brutalized by their ancenstors are in the way, the player is contracted to massacre them. How the hell are we the good guys in that situation?  
2. A primal mind-controls a few of the players' companions in a quest. After defeating the incarnation of the primal, the scions decide to EXECUTE the controlled followers. They were fighting for the scions when they were controlled, and the only reason they were controlled, was because Thancred messed up big time and didn't arrive with reinforcements until everything was over.  
So to recap, the scions want to kill their own allies, who they failed to protect and support when their need for help was greatest.  
The justification for that is that the mind-control supposedly can't ever be broken. So what? The scions are a secret organization of incredibly powerful individuals. They don't seriously expect me to believe that they couldn't safely care for those poor souls after they failed in their responsibilities for them, right? And saying that the mind-controlleds' very existence strenghens the primals, so what? Then it's the scions' duty to work twice as hard to make up for their own shortcoming of the past to cope with those dangers.

fpj0wl,BlackmoreKnight,Cash shop mounts over time,"With the release of the new spriggan mount on the cash shop, I was curious if the oft-stated complaint of ""it's happening more often lately"" held any truth. So, thanks to collection sites, I was able to look through the list of cash shop mounts and the patch they were added on. I am excluding former seasonal reward mounts in this list, as well as collector's edition mounts (If you want to add those in just add 4 to the final total). I am also excluding ""Amazon promo"" mounts because really anyone that wanted them just got gametime they'd buy anyways.

Shadowbringers: 2 (Spriggan, Magic Carpet)

Stormblood: 8 (Fatter Cat, SDS Fenrir [Technically Fanfest too], Indigo Whale, Red Hare, Nezha Chariot, Cirtine Carbuncle, Aquamarine Carbuncle, Panda)

Heavensward: 4 (Fat Moogle, Bennu, Red Baron, White Devil)

ARR: 1 (Sleipnir)

So, yes, we can see a trend towards more cash shop mounts over time. What's notable though is that we have less cash mounts in ShB at this time than we did in Stormblood. By 4.21/4.25, Stormblood had 4 cash shop mounts, right now in ShB at the same time we only have 2. Will we see more later to make up the difference? Maybe. There is a Red Carbuncle and a Peacock mount in the files, so we can probably pre-emptively move ShB up to 4 cash shop mounts. They're just not available in-game yet. If we account for that then the two are equal at this point in time, but my initial look was just at what you could actually get immediately.",17,1585254612,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpj0wl/cash_shop_mounts_over_time/,ffxiv,0

Roommate saw that post and wouldn't shut up about it until I agreed to make it... and now MANY months later, while I'm stuck at home, I finally got around to it.

I know it's kinda lopsided and not that great, but it's the very first thing I ever needle felted. I know how to crochet, but my hands can't do amigurumi, it hurts too much, which was a big reason I refused to make this for such a long time. 

Also, the leaf was wet felted. I love wet felting, it's always a lot of fun! And it's extra great right now keeping my hands in soapy hot water until they nearly fall off, haha.

Looking at it now I think the biggest changes I would make is a lighter color for the feet and arms and a larger body or smaller leaf.

BLUE MAGE (DPS/TANK/HEALER)  
\- I was wondering how to fit this job into its own category and also bring some variety to the existing standard jobs, I came up with the blue mage being able to pick a role, and have different skills depending on the role. Kinda like how an Arcanist can become both a Scholar and a Summoner. This way, Blue Mage can be used for current and upcoming content.   


TIME MAGE (HEALER)  
\- A random thought that occurred to me while playing Dota 2, with Weaver's Time Lapse and Oracle's False Promise. They can ""Rewind"" your hp to heal, and ""Stop"" for mitigation. I don't think Haste and Slow should included though that would be too strong imo.

fpg8ft,Irxsh,Whats with the 2.1-2.55 hate?,"Seriously? Ok let me start off by saying I HATED and i mean hated 1-50 for 90% of the experience, it was dull, boring and uninspiring in every way except ending quests and some other ones that I wont go into detail about because this post isn't focused on that.

I've been playing for about 3 weeks now, I am completely in love with this game, I have no lifed the f\*\*\* out of it since I started playing, and im almost at HW which is said to be the best DLC story wise, and **DARK KNIGHT AAAAAAAAA**, but anyway..

I dreaded the infamous '2.1-2.55' quests, a journey only the strongest of willed people could surpass, at least thats what it was made out to be... I agree the starting quests where you go about moving the HQ of scions, can get pretty dull, but the following storylines were actually quite fun? I am just about finished right now, couple more quests to go but, I feel this is misleading in a way for a new player, I was almost tempted to buy a skip at end of 1-50 because of all the shit I read about these 100 quests, and the fact I had a terrible time for the most part during the 1-50 experience. That shiva fight put goosebumps up my back, when everything froze and she does that clap thingy, its so cinematic, idk how to explain well but godamn, it flowed so nice with the music.. And Ramuh, my god, not on the level of shiva imo but still, cool as shit.. Also even just the intertwining storylines about betrayal and uprest in cities, its interesting, it has me wanting to know what happens next and what not.

So basically all in all, the premise of this post is if someone like me is out there right now, reading reddit posts about how bad the early game is, and how much more dreadful 2.1-2.55 is, its really not that bad **\*IN MY OPINION\***, its actually quite good most of the time and I enjoyed it.",115,1585245551,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpg8ft/whats_with_the_21255_hate/,ffxiv,5

So I just started over from scratch on the Cactar server. 
I haven’t played in a few years and went on a different server than I use to be on (idiot move on my part forgetting my guild would still have taken me back but i wasn’t thinking)
Anyways! I’m looking for some new friends to play with so If anyone’s interested or just wants to help me get back up to speed I’d love it!",1,1585231870,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpc4zu/starting_over_on_cactar/,ffxiv,1
fpc28c,Gesugao97,I quit Blade and Soul for FF14 and it was the best decision I could make,Im posting to Reddit for the first time and Im a newbie in FF14 so please be merciful and dont kill me right away.If necessary I offer my Boyfriend as a replacement. ;) Ive been playing Blade and Soul for 4 Years and now Im putting it on the line after NCSOFT screwed the community at the 4 year anniversary. It was my first MMORPG so FF14 is a whole new world for me and i fell in love at first sight. In BnS its commonplace that you get flamed for every little thing and the community is extremely toxic. In this community i havent experienced this until now I have only met friendly people. In my first Dungeon i walked around partly confused and people were waiting for me so I love the community already now. Ive been busy testing the free version for few days and bought the full version with LvL 30 (LvL 36 at the moment). Im trying to get information with YT Videos and Im on 2 Discord server. As a newcomer you cant geht the good information so it would be nice if you could help me. Im sure there are Discord server for different areas and if there is a Discord Server only in german I would love to join it. What can you recommend about YT videos and what should I do once I reach Max LvL. To be honest the game confuses me a lot because its much more complex than BnS. For example I was also confused that a Clan in FF14 has a diffrent name. I will also join people as soon Im Max LvL because only together we can have adventures. Im really looking forward to experiencing all the adventures with you.,20,1585231599,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpc28c/i_quit_blade_and_soul_for_ff14_and_it_was_the/,ffxiv,1

fpbdr4,Lostsoldier20,Tank Role Actions Guide," [https://youtu.be/g1Y\_nwxa4c4](https://youtu.be/g1Y_nwxa4c4)

So  my next 1-80 is gonna be Warrior but as everyone knows... Tank Role  Actions are kinda VERY tied to playing the role. Yeah sure True North is  cool and all... but your literal first defensive cooldown is a role  action. As is your second. Stun and Interrupt are good skills but hard  to make use of well. Arm's Length slow effect is barely known.  Provoke... is apparently fucking broken now and is enough for you to  tank a low level boss now. No other skills needed.

So  before I actually do WAR, I want a secondary guide to tie into it. My  1-80 guides are long enough without adding 15 minutes onto it for  something I'd need to add to all 4 tanks. So I can just do this instead

Also the vote for what's after WAR is still going!

fpalp0,AlexAverage,Problem with accessing Shadowbringers,"Hi! Little backstory here. I played FFXIV some years ago with ARR, Heavensward and Stormblood installed. Now with the quarantine and all I jumped back in, but with another PSN account and a new Square Enix ID because I couldn't access to another free trial period with the same account.

This PS4 is activated as a primary console on both accounts so I should be able to use the same library. Today I bought Shadowbringers on the new account so I could upgrade my free trial to the real deal. My purchase is showing in the PS4 library, but I can't see it neither in-game nor Lodestone.

fpalme,wwzxc,Is FF14 worth playing for someone who has never had anything to do with FF?,"Hello good people,

I recently got a lot of free time ( as probably a lot of people do these days ) and I want to get into some good mmorpg. I've heard a lot of good things about final fantasy, but I am very curious whether or not it's something for me.

I came from WoW, which I played for a long time, though I wasn't competitive or anything, but I just found that can't enjoy it any longer due to the direction the game is going and the ongoing elitism within the game and generally crappy atmosphere, so my concerns are as follows:

1: how are novice players generally received in dungeons and raiding? Are they being supported or just being shat on, like in WoW ? 

2: as far as I understand, MSQ is a necessity to unlock main features of the game and you generally can't skip it. Is the story somehow related to every other FF game/content or is it a standalone and someone who knows literally nothing about FF can still understand and enjoy it? Is it worth the time it takes to read it, as I've seen it's not voice acted?

3: how's the PvP in this game? Does it even exist? 

4: how's the community in general? Friendly, chill, toxic? \^\_\^

I appreciate everyone who takes time to reply :) Thanks!",112,1585225386,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fpalme/is_ff14_worth_playing_for_someone_who_has_never/,ffxiv,1

I started playing this game roughly to days ago and have just reached lvl 25 and completed the second dungeon. However I created my character on the wrong server and cant transfer it due to having bonuses. Would it be worth it to start again with a brand new character on my desired world or just play the game through with my lvl 25.

fp89k7,Oograth-in-the-Hat,What really grinds my gears...,"What really grinds my gears is people who run these mega sized Free Companies and treat their fc mates, **especially** new players, as live stock to just farm fc points. I see these people up in their level 20s-50s or even higher who are still new to the game, and still know next to nothing about what they're doing. Examples are people who don't go updating their armor when its 10+ levels below their class level, people who are dying or struggling through new areas because they don't know about summoning their chocobos to fight with them or heal them, people who go through dungeons and don't know about their class abilities and just do whatever, and more and more.

If you find out about a person playing on a console, inform them they can hook up a computer keyboard so they can talk to other people, and if you are now finding this out inform others.

If you see a random new player, teach them about some aspects of the game. If you are one of those FC owners who run these giant FCs with hundreds of players and you do **NOTHING** for the new player you just scouted, you are one of the worst kinds of players in my experience. I've been scouted by giant FCs before and I've been there knowing absolutely nothing about the class or game. And the worst part about that is...we don't realize we know anything.

fp4lh3,Lostsoldier20,Tank Role Actions Guide," [https://youtu.be/g1Y\_nwxa4c4](https://youtu.be/g1Y_nwxa4c4)

So my next 1-80 is gonna be Warrior but as everyone knows... Tank Role Actions are kinda VERY tied to playing the role. Yeah sure True North is cool and all... but your literal first defensive cooldown is a role action. As is your second. Stun and Interrupt are good skills but hard to make use of well. Arm's Length slow effect is barely known. Provoke... is apparently fucking broken now and is enough for you to tank a low level boss now. No other skills needed.

So before I actually do WAR, I want a secondary guide to tie into it. My 1-80 guides are long enough without adding 15 minutes onto it for something I'd need to add to all 4 tanks. So I can just do this instead

Also the vote for what's after WAR is still going!

Ich habe mir mal gedacht ich poste hier meine leveling macros rein für angehende faule Crafter.

Die macros sind hauptsächlich gedacht für Ishgard, keine Garantie das sie bei anderen Rezepten funktionieren.

Ich habe immer erst bis lvl 50 gelevelt bevor ich die Ishgard Items gecrafted habe das ich auch einen hohen Sammlerwert erzielen kann.

Groß ist nichts zu beachten vom Gear her, bis auf halt schon auf das aktuelle Level abgestimmt und nicht mit lvl50, 30er sachen an haben.

Ich persönlich habe mit Level 60 und 70 das Gear für die Handwerksscheine benutzt.

lvl60 - Frohehalde für 550 Gelbe Scheine

lvl70 - Bei jedem Scheinewechsler für 750 (Handwerkskönig für jede crafter klasse also nur ein mal kaufen)

Werkzeuge hab ich mir meistens vom Markt Brett geholt oder einfach das von den Quests benutzt.

Obwohl es wahrscheinlich effizienter wäre da auch bessere zu holen.

Schmuck habe ich mir keinen besonderen gekauft bis auf lvl 70 wieder die Handwerkskönig Accessoirs.

Was Buff Food angeht habe ich so gut wie nie was an (weil ich es immer vergesse) aber wenn dann Purpurrote Bete-Suppe oder Blut-Buillabaisse &lt;- wenn hp zu low sein sollte extrem gut.

Übrigens bis lvl 50 Crafte ich nichts anderes als mengen von barre, Leder, Stoff etc. variert ja nach Beruf. Und die Klassenquests nicht vergessen :)

foymrx,Birdoligno,Character Rename Issue,"I just purchased a renaming service on the site, got a message from my card provider stating that the purchase was successful, but I got disconnected from MogStation and, upon relogging, received a message that the payment might not have been processed. Payment History doesnt show this purchase, and I didnt receive the rename prompt when I logged again (this one is fine as I know the renaming service might take a while to process ingame)

&amp;#x200B;

MogStation keeps disconnecting me every time I change into another page, and apparently I cant ask for support in the site because Im not in the US (it requires a Zip Code and a State, neither of which I have to provide)

&amp;#x200B;

Ive read I have up to a week to request support with purchases, so before I panic, how long should I wait for the rename to prompt me, and is there any other way to contact support? Other than phone, because Im not exactly willing to deal with international bills

I logged into my account after a few years about a month ago. It told me that there was suspicious activity. I contacted support, they said I should reset my password. After some messing around with the security question, I finally was able to do so.

I log in. After clicking around about 3 pages, it asks me to log in again. My password doesn't work. Okay. Reset again. It's reset. Log in fine. Get about 3 clicks in, and I'm logged out again. Password doesn't work.

I've been through this about a dozen times. This doesn't even take into account that it's not recognizing that I have a license for the game (which I'm fine buying a new one since it's the same price with all the expansions right now as just getting the expansions I don't have). But the frustration around my password is to the point where I don't want to give them any money and I'm actively considering not buying Final Fantasys on the Switch because screw this.

fonv6a,Diego2112Gaming,Bardic Performance and Guitar as a MIDI Controller with Bome Translator,"So I've seen the tutorials on using MIDI keyboards. Straightforward, easy enough. That's cool. Love it.

I can't play keyboard, nor do I have a MIDI controller keyboard.

What I DO have is a rather sizable guitar collection, a USB interface, DAW, and fairly decent tech knowledge. Anyone know anything about Bome Translator Classic presets for guitar that could work for FFXIV? I've got everything set up to where the game recognizes my guitar as a valid input, and to where I can even make some noise on it--but the MIDI preset I found for keyboard doesn't quite fit the guitar neck (shocker, I know).

If no one does, that's fine, I can probably work it all out, it'll just take a while, and I figured if the work's already been done, might could save some time and get to jamming that much faster.

fonej5,Asylsson,"Seriously, don't be these guys !","**Warning : Very long post ahead (TL;DR at the bottom)**

Here is a little background first : I want to say I enjoy this game since mid-late ARR 2.1. I was one of those who would skip every CS after reaching 50 when I began the Raid scene. I don't know anything about HW nor SB. With the release of Shadowbringers I promised myself I would watch the MSQ and so I did. And OMG it was glorious ! So much that I regret not doing it earlier because I didn't get a few references or wouldn't know some PNJ names which ruined it a little. 

I decided to take a second shot at the game with a brand new avatar on another server. I used the opportunity to switch from PC to PS4 too for other reasons but it's an important detail for this post because with a new game license I began the game as a green sprout (not sure if I would have gotten one with another avatar on the same game account ?).

With the huge bonus exp. (Road to 70 buff) I quickly understood I had to share it among a few jobs so I leveled a tank, a healer and a dps in parallel. I also allowed the tooltips to pop, not because I need them but just as a reminder for when I can start to use something. And this is what caused my first of all concerns about the community nowadays. Everything went fine until...

**Sastasha**

I tagged as a healer. The ""*There is a first time player in the party and you will be awarded a bonus after completion*""-message pops. There were 3 tooltips which popped as well and caught me off guard. Anyway even if I wanted to read them, there was no way I could have done it....the tank had already pulled. Not one and not two packs. He pulled everything from the start until the first shell with the fire thingies. I personally don't care because at this level there is not anything else I can do apart from spamming Cure to keep him alive and start throwing stones when the pack shrinks. But it hit me because I am a *supposed* new player and I thought it could have been stressful for a real newbie to handle this since it's the first dungeon and the tooltips may contain important information.

The rest of the dungeon went on the same as it began, shortest usual way to the bosses, skipping the unnecessary rooms. Again, I'm not complaining. I know how it's usually done. But to give you a comparison from 6-7 years ago, the first time I really did this dungeon I remembered the tank saying in party chat something like ""Oh it's your first time ? Do you want a full map run ?"". The healer agreed to do it too. It was awesome !

**Copperbell Mines** and **Tam-Tara** went exactly the same way with the tanks pulling as much as he possibly can. Then comes my absolute favorite...

**Toto-Rak**

I know...you hate it, I hate it and I'm sure over 90% of the community hates it as well. Sucks to get it in your low level roulette but hey it's part of the game. This time I was a DPS and the tank was a first time as well. I'm pretty sure the other DPS and the healer tagged together, you'll see why soon. After killing the first two packs the tank decided to take the left room instead of going right. Now I know a few ways to do Toto-Rak. Most people ignore the left room, other take it. I don't really care. What I have never seen though is the tank heading left with a DPS (me) and the healer going right with the other DPS to continue the dungeon. No message in the party log, nothing....just let the sprouts die (they didn't !). And sure enough, every time the tank went the wrong way or pulled unnecessary mobs the two parasites went on with the dungeon. The tank was only healed if he happened to be at the right place. I was fuming...but I didn't react, I never do. I don't want to risk a ban for poorly chosen words because of idiots. Reddit isn't the same though. I don't care if I'm banned here so I'll tell you : If you were one of the two players there : Fuck you ! You are ruining the whole game experience from a new player who was still learning to tank and was doing a great job at it tbh. If you don't want to waste time in Toto-Rak I suggest you leave right away and eat your penalty.

**Haukke**

This one went like first three dungeons except :

1. The mobs hit (relatively) harder
2. I had to spam Cure II on large packs

What's the difference ? Well there was a BLM and like every good BLM he was AoE'ing which sounds logical, right ? But if you're a healer you also know that at this level with both tank and BLM AoE'ing the pack as a whole will uniformly go down meaning most mobs stay alive longer and the tank is gonna eat harder damage. You'll also know that spamming *Cure II* to keep the tank alive will get you oom real quick so you'll want to use *Lucid Dreaming* early. But tell me : How is a new player supposed to know that ? Why do you pull door-to-door when the healer has the only sprout and you got that ""*first time bonus*""-message ? Again, I don't care because I can handle it like any healer with some experience could. But the minimum would have been to ask the healer first if they're ok with that. The party chat exists for a reason. Do you want to know what really killed me in this dungeon ? It wasn't the huge packs of mobs. It wasn't the last Boss who was pulled while I was watching the (short) CS...no, it was that after the dungeon and the loot distribution the tank stayed a few more seconds to try and get a commendation. Unfortunately the game doesn't allow me to give you a finger so you'll just get nothing instead as pitty as it sounds. Just go and let me walk backwards to get that full map achievement.

This was my new experience so far. I really don't know if I would have played FFXIV for so long if my first real experiences would have been like the ones I got this time. I think the community is becoming toxic but maybe I was just unlucky. The road to 80 is still long; Let's see what happens next. Before you ask, as a HL player, I always tried to help new players when doing a roulette like I was helped when I joined the game a few years ago. It's really interesting to see the PoV of new players nowadays though.

TL;DR If you see a new player in dungeon, try to take things at his pace and don't ruin his gaming experience",69,1585128507,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fonej5/seriously_dont_be_these_guys/,ffxiv,1

fom1nq,Nightgrieve,Data Acquisition assistance (Zonureskin treasure maps),"Hello all, I had a few ideas tonight I wanted to test to see if we could figure out a way to predict the doors in the ShB treasure map dungeon to a degree.  Ideas for conditions to test came to me at different points throughout the night so some of my data is incomplete.  I'm wondering if the mobs &amp; order of their spawn plays a role in what door to select and am wanting to collect data to test my theory.  I was putting together a spreadsheet tonight and would very much appreciate help with adding data to it with everyone's experiences.

Questions to answer:  
1. Where did the portal spawn?  
2. What room number?  
3. 1st mob to spawn?  
4. 2nd mob(s) to spawn?  
5. Did the 2nd group spawn to the right or left?  
6. 3rd mob(s) to spawn?  
7. Did any special mobs appear? (Trickster/Keeper/Numbered onions)  
8. Did rainbow light save you from a bad door?  
9. Which door allowed you to continue? (Type the opposite door if you were ejected)  


So far this is a compile of my data (please feel free to add to it)

myself the friend, the damned honest stalwart ally, whereas you could not even hold your tongue the moment someone didn't proceed through older content in your unique way; you tried your hardest to denigrate me in a single message, just for your own pleasure, just for your own ego after one teensy tiny wipe in our thorough tapestries as Warriors of Light in the beautiful world of Eorzea... let us first begin by addressing this sanctimonious tone, deconstructing your demand, which begins with you barking that I ""cast stone""-- ignoring the rest of your inanity, this alone is an insult to any healer who has struggled to mount and overcome the class quests, these students of nature who, through the act of teaching (much like I intended to teach you, until your lack of defensives and AoE awareness and your message staved me off, and created an extremely rare instance where I, as a white mage of considerable, interminable kindness, wanted nothing to do with you), become more aware that every spell wrought by conjurers and white mages contains a bond between the elements and ourselves, such that one would not ""cast stone,"" or even ""use stone,"" as these are both misrepresentative of the relationship, no, for we would befriend the stone, trust the stone to do our unspeakabke act of harm because every mender, myself included at the zenith of generosity and kindness, in a time of extreme strife, like in a story duty or a warmup guildhest, need to inflict pain to resolve a situation that may cause more pain if let untreated, and this ethical quandary attacks the very nature of the elemental bond itself, as it is even when healing, as our every communication to nature is a resonance beautiful in its activity, yet ultimately put towards the fruition of violence, a sad fate for something so beautiful unlike your dreary outfit, but a necessity, for to progress in action we must take action ourselves, yet hear my clear on this: I will not take ensure the superfluous abuse of the rock element just to satisfy your poorly-worded command, which I cannot believe you really did make at me, using such language as ""cast stone,"" as if the world and the things it were made of are so simple, simple like tanking, which is apparently as of yet exceeding your bandwidth as proven by your inability to dodge AoE markers from giant stone heads, in a sickening display that makes sense in the content of what I am dealing with now, this terrible interaction, so poorly reflective of the community, of nature, of the very idea of harmony--and secondly, you said ""on"" the bees--which is simply embarrassing, for ""on"" is a general indicator of a buff or debuff, while my violent spell stone (which I rarely consider due to its elusiveness towards our Earth) is a damaging spell intended to inflict a flat sum of harm against an opponent in order to stop their rampage, to provide succor to those suffering by returning pain to the sufferer, instantly and directly accosting the foe in a way that this word should be ""at,"" not ""on,"" a correction that winds up putting in full view your total incompetence, and revealing that your demand to me was made in earnest of looking better yourself, perhaps fulfilling a void left in you by inattentive parents (which in turn made you careless of your own warrior of light, placing them in avoidable harm), rather than an eager plea to improve the experience of you, our two teammates, and myself, the latter two of which are now greatly bemused by your desperation, so chew on that: your desperation to make ""mommy"" and ""daddy"" love you by shifting the blame for our wipe onto me has failed, because in you inanity you forgot to use proper language, a real pathetic display--and, even at the end of your barked order, ""the bees"" raises a few questions—you must be unaware that TWO BEES spawn at a time on the normal version of Sunken Temple of Qarn, a rather, if I may say, mediocre dungeon whose mechanics should be clear and memorized by the second run, the third run if you are slower than the normal player (no offense), and I believe you may be (really, no offense, it’s just how it is) because you were hit by an Aoe from the head, the HEAD, if you really want me to cast stone, why not on that enemy whose circular AoEs, ones you have seen all throughout your career—at least, let me check your search info… oh dear god, you really have THREE DPS classes at level 80, and you are now leveling a fourth, meanwhile the queues and the game in general STARVE for healers, and yet you keep relying on us, and keep pushing us around, despite you not once stepping into our shoes, and I’m sorry if I sound cross, but that is utterly unacceptable—and it must have take a redoubled effort for your addled mind to forget, stone, this spell that abuses the elements, can only hit ONE bee at a time, thus making it moot, although even I had holy I would not use it, as that puts me into danger.

fofc9z,Birdoligno,Crafting and Inventory,"Hey guys
So I recently started the game, and took the DoH classes to see how crafting works in the game (honestly, my favorite crafting system)

The Active Help stated that crafted equipment would be automatically added to the Armory, but instead all armors and arms I crafted were added to the common Inventory (which I discovered because Im lazy and I normally just click the ""Recommended Gear"" button whenever I get an item that might be an improvement lol)

Did I miss something? Is there an option in the config that changes this behavior? Or is the Active Help description wrong?

Thanks in advance!",5,1585091311,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fofc9z/crafting_and_inventory/,ffxiv,1

fod2tp,Anngerr,"South America Data Center, show your support!","Hi, i'm here to talk about how much i love this game, and how i believe that our region, South America, deserves some love.I just wanna start saying, that I've been playing games for few decades now, and i believe most of you would agree that FFXIV is the best MMO right now, at least from my point of view. And to enjoy the best this game can offer, a decent ping is something that really make the experience way better.I play from Brazil, and here we have 230ms\~ on the best connection in american servers. It is not unplayable, but after some years, we would really hope that a South American server would become reality.

You know that time when a guy  keep dying to the same mechanics over and over, no one likes having this guy, also no one likes being this guy. And sometimes this guy is not bad, he just lives too far from the Data Center, and its safe to argue that saying ""Well just look for another game"" doesn't feel right.

As a lover of this game, as much as you, I'm asking you guys to help and show some support getting attention from Square Enix, to hopefully play this game on a better quality. I know it sounds too hopeful, but i gotta do my part.

I've seen our community, and we are great, and its a pleasure to make part of it. Cheers!",31,1585083610,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fod2tp/south_america_data_center_show_your_support/,ffxiv,1

So I was expecting 30 more days of subscription but my SE account didn't took notice of it and just kept the days I had left for the 1st free month.

Do you think I can fix this ? If yes, how ? Or, the fact that the Complete Edition also has ARR included caused the offer to be cancelled ?

fo3unz,MarsAstro,Shadowbringers music and Blade Runner,"One of the somber and emotional tracks in Shadowbringers is called [""Tears in the Rain""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQp9_IHra7k). It's often played when Emet-Selch relays the tales of the old society of the Ascians.

At the very end of the game, as we defeat Hades, he has one last request for us: ""Remember us. Remember that we once lived"". It's a plea to not let the memories of those grandiose things from the Ascians past be forgotten.

In Blade Runner, the film adaptation of the novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", there's a famous impromptu line at the very end of the film. Right after saving the protagonist Deckard, the dying android Roy Batty says: 

""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like **tears in rain**. Time to die.""

fo394n,BDLane,Billed in spite of a time card?,"I need some help. I have been VERY short of cash this month, so a friend gifted me a 60 day timecard. Yay, that should let me play for another couple months!

Apparently time cards do NOT change the time Squeenix will force a bill on you? As of two ish hours ago I got billed a full subscription fee in spite of the active timecard (in theory... it claims the code is redeemed..), and says I only have 30 days remaining on my sub - the billed time as of a couple hours ago.

Needless to say now my account at the bank is going to/has already bounced, and I'm screwed on that front, but I can't imagine there's much to actually be done about it. But what the hell happened to the gift of 60 days??? Why did it just EAT my time card?!? Why did it force a payment through IN SPITE of the time card??

I am very upset right now, obviously. I can't find any information on why I was billed in spite of a card, or what happened to the card because I can't even find a RECORD of it.",9,1585047623,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fo394n/billed_in_spite_of_a_time_card/,ffxiv,1

fo2vse,Ziggybee,HW White Mage returning for later expansions. Weapon Question,"Hi I'm on the later 3.x Main story quests to start Stormblood.

My problem is that I left the game while in process to upgrade my Awoken into Majesta.

It will require me several days of grinding the tokens and Poetics (not to mention the later materials to further evolve it) required and I'm feeling that, from a progression point of view is a waste of time (I will prolly do it for glamour, taking advantage of roulettes, but at the moment I'd like to enjoy the story and progress into the later expansions).

Don't ask me why, but before leaving the game I completely discarded the option given by the Main Story of acquiring the Augmente Hailstorm Cane (il 240) that now, in retrospect may have been a wise choice to have.

My question is: what options do I have (mostly by drops and quests) to acquire a better Main Weapon for my WM to end the il200+ quests and content?

I guess that starting Stormblood I'll have the usual quests with equipment upgrades but at the moment the Awoken staff is getting me behind in terms of healing / attack power and I'd like a more smoother and safer gameplay (especially when grouping).

Other equip is not an issue since I was almost topped on everything else il200+",1,1585045662,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fo2vse/hw_white_mage_returning_for_later_expansions/,ffxiv,1

fo2s3c,dizzyteacup,Mouse and Keyboard VS Controller on PS4,"Hey there!

I’m just reaching out to ask everyone for some opinions on whether they prefer controller or mouse/keyboard for PS4.

My fiancé just joined FFXIV tonight with me so we can play together, so I am ecstatic! He is playing on PS4, and he’s currently trying out mouse/keyboard. Both are Corsair pieces—not sure which model.

I noticed while watching on his screen that he has a ~ 0.5 second delay on his movement inputs on keyboard. Mouse is fine. On PC for me, character responds immediately to input and turns or steps. For him, he has to hold the button down to start movement and it’s hard to make small/precise movements. It doesn’t make the game unplayable, but I definitely think it’s going to make things hard for him in higher level activities, and it puts him at a disadvantage dodging AOEs since he has less time to react. It also has slow inputs when typing in chat which makes it hard for him to send messages.

Are there any settings we should take a look at to correct the input delay? We did already go into PS4 settings and change the rates to short/fast on keyboard and that helped a tiny bit but we still have a noticeable delay.

And if there are no suggestible fixes for this, what is the consensus on controller for gameplay? I’ve seen some people that like it, but it seems a little overwhelming to me? My fiancé is planning to main Black Mage, so is that a viable rotation on controller set up?

I’ll be grateful for any advice! Thanks guys!",26,1585045108,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fo2s3c/mouse_and_keyboard_vs_controller_on_ps4/,ffxiv,1

I'm still with the free trial atm, but I can see myself upgrading to the full game. 

I installed the game onto my old hd, and I'm thinking I might want to change the install location to my new ssd to improve load times. How would I go about that without losing my character (the game says it won't save my character to the FF14 cloud)?

Should I be making new characters anyway? Like, have one magic guy from the magic race and one melee guy from the muscle-race? Or is it ok to just stick with my catgirl and level her up in everything and call it good?

Is it possible to individually select the size and location of the individual pieces of the hud? It seems that there was an option I found, but fiddling with it doesn't do anything. The Thaumaturge has a big damn thing covering up the mission reminders on the side of the screen. Can I change that?

fnzxep,unlimitedblack,"Set during 5.2 MSQ quest ""A Whale's Tale""...","\[This is a work of fan-fiction that takes place during the most recent MSQ, while Urianger and Thancred convalesce in Sullen. Posted here purely for your enjoyment.\]

Urianger: When last didst we find time to idle ourselves, for want of duty?  
Thancred: Time on this godsforsaken star has truly been little more than a blur to me, until recently. I don't know how you've kept any of it straight.   
Urianger: Ever hath I taken sleep only when mine eyes demanded. Though heedless art we all of the turnings of this star, full certain am I that we hath not had the space of a drawn breath in years.  
Thancred: Too long, in any case.   
Urianger: ...  
Thancred: ...   
Urianger: ...  
Thancred: You and I both know you never speak without a reason, even if you make up for rarity with quantity. Say what you mean to say, since we've found our 'drawn breath' for the era.  
Urianger: A tale hath I for thee, my friend, though hard-pressed am I to tell it.  
Thancred: No time like the present. Besides, it's been long enough since you've regaled me with one of your tales.  
Urianger: Mockest thou mine habitual reticence?  
Thancred: The only thing I'm mocking is my own failure to listen to you properly over the years. You spend enough time learning to read between the lines of fast-talking swindlers and thieves, and it dulls your sense for when a story is much longer in the telling, as is your wont. That said, there are only so many hours in a day now, so get on with it.   
Urianger: Mayhaps thou hast noticed in thy travels, though with great rarity, a personage of striking familiarity might appear? Someone who seemeth woven of the selfsame cloth as thou mayest have known in the star of our provenance?  
Thancred: Once or twice, perhaps. I don't usually forget a face. And Ryne, for all of her possession of Minfilia's spirit, doesn't have the same face. I found portraits of past Minfilias in Eulmore, and even if I assume the artists knew what they were doing, all of them had a feature here or there that was proof they weren't m-... our Minfilia.   
Urianger: Only once hath I met such. And yet, t'would seem the gods saw fit to echo, even on this unfamiliar star, the clarion song of mine unique misfortune.  
Thancred: ... oh no. Not Moenbryda?  
Urianger: As though she stepped from mine own memory, save for the mark of our august order. Meldia was her name, a scholar and a warrior both, and no less. Whilst I dwelt in the Crystarium as the Exarch's guest, with all my vigor did I plumb the depths of his libraries in my search for knowledge lost of this star and its troubles. There didst she find me, this time a refrain of the first.   
Thancred: I don't like where this tale is headed.  
Urianger: Pray heareth the rest. Upon our meeting I found mine thoughts adrift whensoever I needed focus. The inquisition of who she was, how alike she was to mine bosom companion lost, did ever halt my power to seeketh out the knowledge we required. Yet I couldst no more unveileth the truth than I couldst be false in the mirrored light of she whom always knew me best. Further I could not bear to be in her presence, for my shame of all I did fail to utter her twin.  
Thancred: So what happened?  
Urianger: Full too long didst I deliberate the perfect argument to offer, and yet the gods were merciful, to allow me this meager penance. I didst tell her truly that she was far too like a companion that fate did shear from the tapestry of my life; that to see her pained me, and that no salve could cure so timeworn and deep an ache. Surely thou knewest enough of our moon to full well realize her answer.  
Thancred: Well, once she realized you were serious and not blustering, which for her I know would take a spell, Moenbryda would say ""the only way to know for sure is to test my hypothesis!"" And then she'd have some exceedingly clever plan she made up on the spot to solve the puzzle of your pain and her want for your companionship in one fell swoop. Ever the problem-solver.  
Urianger: Just so. Canst thou imagine my shock when, in this first instance since I did meet this mirror of our friend and did weather again, as before, her frequent and most energetic attempts to gaineth my attentions, she didst fall silent and speak not a word?   
Thancred: Well... to be fair, we know she's NOT really Moenbryda, so expecting the same answer from her simply because she looks the same or mostly the same would be a mistake.   
Urianger: Just so.  
Thancred: ... and godsdammit at last I realize why you're telling me this story now. Ryne is not Minfilia. None of the others that Minfilia ever imparted her powers to were ever truly HER. But I feel like I've already learned that lesson. I've been pretty good about letting Ryne make her own choices and take her own risks.  
Urianger: Through much tribulation and great damage upon thy soul didst thou finally reacheth such a conclusion. I confess that the Twelve in their generosity did grant me such a message by a shorter path, for verily didst Meldia did, at last, unfurl her own tapestry before me. As I did lose my dear Moenbryda to an enemy most dire, so had Meldia lost too a companion that, by her words illuminated, didst resemble myself in some small way. That treasured comrade didst follow the headstrong Meldia into a battle most unwise, and in rescuing her did he find himself wounded cruelly by a sin eater. Indeed, Meldia's scholarly pursuit didst begin in earnest to seek a panacea for the fated blight that afflicted her ally, yet it came to naught. And that tale endeth in a manner thou knowest.  
Thancred: Okay, this took a turn I did not expect.   
Urianger: In pursuing mine self, Meldia didst seek atonement, and yet in hearing mine tale she didst uncover the selfsame truth I saw illustrated before me as hers reached its conclusion: fate and destiny doth weave a legend all their own, together a bard as enigmatic as the audience whom they doth seek to enlighten, and no scholar however learned can do more than guess at destiny's whim. We two hungered both for the same repast, of a chance to recapture an arrow let fly long ago. But no magick exists that can effect what seemeth so a simple thing.  
Thancred: ... well, at the very least tell me how this story ends, since I clearly shouldn't make any guesses at it.  
Urianger: A meal we shared at the Wandering Stairs, a toast we raised to those we hath lost, and then did we part our ways. Ere long I departed for Il Mheg to continueth mine studies. I hath not seen her since, nor hath she sought me out. I pray that she is well, and somewhere perhaps she enjoys the night that the Warrior of Darkness hath returned to the First.   
Thancred: Well... that's... good, then?  
Urianger: Doth something of the end of this vex thee?  
Thancred: So you're not telling me this story to teach me a lesson, but instead telling me this... why? To show how we both ended up in the same place of missing someone we cared for deeply and yet also have to let go of their memory?   
Urianger: Just so.   
Thancred: Well... it's nice to know I'm not alone, for once. Thank you, Urianger.  
Urianger: So too do I thank you, Master Thancred. It doth hearten me to share this chapter with one who beareth similar wounds.",1,1585029046,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fnzxep/set_during_52_msq_quest_a_whales_tale/,ffxiv,1

is there such thing as housing items moving on there own when no one is supposedly around?

a dear friend of mine said they logged into a very decorated room of there house apparently strewn all over the place (I was sleeping when this happened) they only had me and another friend on there shared estate settings and we both had permission to move/place things but we had absolutely zero reason for wanting to do something like this.

I dont understand how something like this could happen (and im really trying not to suspect the other friend in my panicked state). the only other thing I can think of is the house makes extensive use of housing glitches so did the game for some reason try to correct something causing things to get thrown everywhere for some reason?

And I gotta say, replaying the earlier part of the game with someone whose brand new to Eorzea is amazing. They point out some many things that I remember falling in love with when I first started, but have since become normal and kinda fade into the background. Mechanical things like how the game actually plays fairly well on controller. Aesthetic things like the beauty of Gridania and the Shroud. And of course how cute the Moogles are. I love the power of the world building and storytelling that this game has that even from the beginning, when you’re still a lowly new adventurer who’s doing a lot of “fetch this, kill that”, you still can find things that draw you into the world and make Eorzea come alive. 

On a side note, what are some things to make sure I introduce them to? We’ve only been playing a few days a bit at a time, so we’re still in Gridania, but I want to make sure I don’t miss anything good.",12,1585013669,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fnweru/discovering_eorzea_anew/,ffxiv,1

fnp9o1,StuckInTheK-Hole,How's warrior for soloing old raid content compared to paladin?,"One of my favorite things to do in this game to relax besides gathering is soloing old raid content, although I really haven't done much of it yet. I hear a lot of people say paladin and warrior are pretty great for this purpose but I don't like paladin nearly as much as I do warrior. Those of you who are really familiar with soloing old content, how do the two compare in your personal views?

fnp6fl,SativaLover6969,I’ve played everyday since beta.,"The game has gone downhill since 2.3 

PF has become trash because everyone is cliqued up and everything happens privately. And those private groups are the most toxic things in the game. They talk shit about each other behind each other’s backs to the point It feels like high school. 

Normally I can complete all 4 savage raid that release within the first month. In party finder. But this season I’ve completed 3. Shiva has people so retarded I haven’t completed it yet. I myself can one shot the fight without mistakes, but I’ve yet to find a group who can, after many hours of trying different groups. Most of the time it ends up with waiting a hour or longer for the party to fill up, for someone to either leave within 5mins or the party disbanded before even going in. Everyone is so blacklist friendly I’ve been blacklisted for no reason as some scape goat to the parties issues. 

The game is full of whining kids who are full of emotional problems. The game is full of people who just want to play dress up and house. The games raiding scene is absolutely dead. 

I can’t wait for the day FFlogs is deleted and ACT is actively gamegaurded because most of you dumb players don’t even know how to use it correctly. You have people looking at dancers dps saying it’s low when their partner was dead most of the time.  You have people looking at fflogs and seeing green and blues but don’t realize it’s based of the % of people cleared...

fnlyzx,nnnnnemo,skills requiring targeting not going off in party instances?,"since this popped up only yesterday I'll still have to follow up tomorrow to rule out more possibilities. i've also sent a bug report but thought i'd try to get a few opinions here while I wait. so far I've been a DRK in these scenarios, for reference. 

22/3: 
saw in a unsynced grouped instance(Seiryu EX) that apart from very specific moments(between mechanics and auto attacks) I cannot use skills that require enemy targeting, even if I had the enemy targeted and was within melee distance. 

-This includes the single target damage rotations, damage off GCDs, Provoke, Interject, Low Blow. The AOE damage rotations and Salted Earth went off fine, and I could shirk/damage mitigate fine as well without any lag. IIRC I could cast The Blackest Night with a '/t &lt; 2 &gt;' macro on my co-tank during that.

-I ruled out keyboard problems by using a mouse to click the skills instead: that didn't work. 

-Had to log off so I couldn't try more.

23/3: 

Logged in, tried out a Normal Raids DR to see if it was a one-off occurence. It happened again, and since I was a Steam player, I reinstalled the game through Steam.

-after reinstalling, I went to test if there were any targeting problems through a training dummy in the housing districts. Skills went off fine. Then I went to do Seiryu EX, solo, to test if I could cast skills in instances, and skills went off fine there as well. 

-Deciding I may have solved the problem, I went to do Trials DR, and landing in a party for Garuda(hard), only for the problem to happen again.

Now that I'm away from my computer there's a few things I'm gonna test next time I get the chance: 
1. Try healing, and see if my damage spells happen at all. 2. Install the game on a different computer to see if it's related to problems on my current computer.

fnhrkx,Barrelgod1,Is this game right for me? I usually don't like MMOs.,"Hey guys, I've been on the fence with this game off and on for a while now because I'm not totally sure of I'll like it because I've never really liked MMOs that I have tried in the past like WOW and ESO, and i don't want to make a big investment if I'm not 100% sure.

Why I'm interested:

I love Final Fantasy in general and this game looks so beautiful. The graphics, the animations, the character design, etc. It all looks incredible.

A few of my friends also play this game and seem to really seem to enjoy it but they tend to like MMOs anyway.

I'm a total sucker for job/class systems and ff14's looks super interesting. It's why i love games like FF, Dragon quest, and D&amp;D.

I don't mind grinding, i actually kind of like it. I have thousands of hours logged into the monster hunter franchise which is exclusively about grinding for loot.

From what I've heard, the community around this game is super positive and helpful.

What makes me unsure/why I don't like MMOs:

Combat: Probably the biggest killer for MMOs for me. When i hit something in a game i like to feel some meat behind the blow or the spell. Hurting an enemy in God of War, Doom, Monster Hunter, or even in turn-based RPGs like Darkest Dungeon, Divinity, Persona, or Fire Emblem feels awesome, almost like you can feel the weight behind it. I just don't FEEL this sensation when I played MMOs, i just felt like i was hitting things with a pool noodle even if i was dealing a lot of damage. 

Information Overload: I feel like a lot of MMOs just dump everything in the game onto you at once and it leaves me without any sense of direction. I often find my quest long full of random quests I don't even remember taking and just sit in my backlog, and on top of that the rewards for doing them often feel like they weren't even worth my time. Like maybe i get a couple of scraps for a piece of armor that'll be weaker than what I'm currently wearing by the time i make it. Sure there's usually a tutorial but as soon as that ends it's like 15 messages from the game that are each 10 pages long with a wall of text on each page of information and events.

I'll be playing on console: before my inbox floods with the master race, don't worry i have already ascended to PC. I did years ago, but I only use it for single player games since pretty much all my friends have ps4s. I know there's crossplay but i wouldn't play it on my PC anyway because I just can't play games that require reacting quickly on mouse and keyboard. So i was wondering if the experience is really bogged down or suboptimal if playing on a controller.

Thanks in advance for your opinions guys, I really want to get into this game but I really have to be sure if i wanna spend any money on it.",4,1584959412,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fnhrkx/is_this_game_right_for_me_i_usually_dont_like_mmos/,ffxiv,1

fngle2,AspirantCrafter,Gunbreaker's theme,"So, I don't get Gunbreaker and it's making it hard to play it.

Paladins  fight with sword, shield and magic. They destroy their enemies and protect their allies, but also fight between themselves to raise one paladin as the ruler above all others, or else the conflict of their souls ends up destroying one another.

Warriors fight with a giant axe and they mostly shake off the damage they sustain while rampaging in a berserker, aether-powered rage - a rage so mindless that the warrior risks losing themselves in it, becoming no more than a beast. 

Dark Knights wield giant swords to hunt and punish the wicked, powering their offense and defense with the powers of the darkness within/their emotions. They risk being consumed by that same darkness and losing themselves.

But Gunbreakers are... I don't know. Their weapons are small, they don't have a shield, they were supposed to be a royal guard that were the vanguard against the garleans and their powerful firearms but I don't really get their theme. They feel like a DPS, and they look somewhat like a DPS too. What are their tanking theme? What makes them able to sustain damage? Do they risk something doing that, like the other tanks? It's all technology plus aether manipulation? They look so uninspired, IMO.

fnd3df,Vesheryn,Right mouse button double clicking on single press.,"Is anyone else having a similar issue as this? Basically, when I right-click the game has been registering it as multiple presses. It doesn't happen all the time but seems to occur more frequently when I am around other players. It has been making it near impossible to move while keeping both button pressed since I would be moving and then suddenly do a stutter step or stop entirely. Sometimes I can't even move the camera with right mouse. I have tried reinstalling drivers and checking and unchecking different options. I came across old threads on Reddit and in the forums that seem to cover the same issue however none of them have definite answers and they are all pretty old. This does NOT happen with any other game and the mouse is only a few months old. 

I am currently using a Logitech g502 Hero mouse. I am pretty confident that it is NOT a hardware issue. My main evidence for that is that it noticeably gets worse if I am around more people and it eases up when I move away from them. Also, the buttons work normally everywhere EXCEPT in FFXIV. 

At this point it has actually been negatively affecting my playing to the point I can not run my healer since moving my camera also is causing misclicks. 

If anyone has any ideas or solutions I would be happy to hear them. At this point I am debating getting a new mouse to see if SE just hates this one and/or it actually IS defective. Again I want to emphasize that this is ONLY happening with FFXIV.",5,1584933881,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fnd3df/right_mouse_button_double_clicking_on_single_press/,ffxiv,1

fn9hl9,Beegee7730,Square Enix's stance on illicit activities,"So lately there's been a lot of discussion over people using third party tools to automate playing the game, AKA botting. With the completion of the first phase of Ishgard rankings a lot of accusations have been thrown around on users automating their gameplay to gather large amounts of points in a short periot of time.

There are two major users of bots: RMT and gil farmers who sell the items/currency on the black market, and casual players who use bots to automate the more tedious parts of gameplay.

Whilst Square Enix do issue bans for botting, the numbers are relatively small. Every week they [release numbers](https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/0e9bad55fb40314bf0d40009202f4b362bd219ab) on how many accounts have had actions taken against them for RMT or other illicit activities. In the above link a total of 19 bots were actioned, with 3 terminations and 16 temporary suspensions. Whilst I don't know how it is determined that accounts are botting, as of October last year there were a reported 1.18 million active accounts. I think it's fair to assume that less than 0.001% of active accounts are botting each week.

Everyone has seen the hoardes of ARC/BLMs teleporting around low-level zones blasting away mobs, and this seems to come in waves with hundreds of players appearing at once, usually in off-peak times. Lately they are even more blatant, teleporting to aetherytes or walking out of bounds.

Square Enix seems to mainly focus on the RMT and gil farmers when banning users, however there is blatant bot use from casual players, too. If Walking around the world it is not uncommon to see players travelling between gathering nodes on set paths, performing the same actions in sequence with very little variation. I've also noticed bots doing relatively inconsequential content - The most obvious being the ""Leap of Faith"" GATE in the Gold Saucer. The bots are very obvious - They are inaccurate, often jumping to their doom or deliberating on their jumps, standing on the spot and turning left and right. The most recent addition of the new GATE zone has made this all the more obvious, with many players simply jumping off the edge at the first hurdle.

Square Enix clearly do not support third party tools when playing the game - This has been reiterated multiple times in live letters, and emphasised with the changes to waymarks to restrict automatic tools. Obviously world first raid content is used to reflect the game as a whole, with many potential players watching the streams to gauge their interest in the game. If Square Enix were to ""allow"" these tools it would reflect badly on the game. However once a player has created an account one of the first things they will be greeted with is hoardes of faceless characters nuking everything within a 5 mile radius of the city states.

Will Square Enix ever counter this blatant abuse of the ToS? Do you think it actually impacts regular players, or is it just a harmless way to make the game less grindy?",18,1584919326,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fn9hl9/square_enixs_stance_on_illicit_activities/,ffxiv,1

I use Steam Link through an Android device and by controller is connected through the device.  I can use Steam Link find and the controller is caught - I play plenty of games this way.  But FFXIV doesn't catch this - I assume because the controller is connected through Android and not the PC.

Is there a way to utilize Steam Link and have FFXIV register the controller?  If not with the PC version, would having a Steam copy of FFXIV register the controller through Steam Link?",5,1584916833,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fn8tm1/steam_link_android_and_controller/,ffxiv,1

 Sorry for the way I recorded it, it was the only way of getting it on camera It was a one time thing that I could never replicate again. I just happen to notice at the right time I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So what do all of these mean? Here's a summary

1. Initially it seems that the longer you've played FFXIV, the more likely you'll enjoy the game regardless if you enjoyed the story or not.
2. BUT after dissecting it to each expansion, we see that  

   1. Enjoying ARR is not significantly associated with enjoying the game overall. People enjoyed the game even if we took out their experience of ARR.
   2. Enjoying HW and SHB is SIGNIFICANTLY associated with enjoying the game. Enjoying HW means you're 1.6 times more likely to enjoy playing FFXIV. Enjoying SHB means you're 1.4 times more likely to enjoy playing FFXIV.
   3. Experiencing STB suggests that you're more likely to NOT enjoy the game (LOL). But it's not statistically significant.

The code for this can be found at:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmk0fw/ffxiv\_survey\_for\_ministudy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmk0fw/ffxiv_survey_for_ministudy/) 

&amp;#x200B;

So why did I do this? Well, it's because our resident gatekeeper u/Angelicel decided to state the following.

&gt;there's plenty of people that play for the gameplay alone

\&gt;Then FFXIV isn't for you and I'm sorry that you think it is. I'm not going to lie to you and tell you the story gets better because if you don't like the story in ARR then you're better off not playing

Then proceeded to goad me into proving them wrong

&gt;I'm sure it's easy enough to find a sample size large enough playing this game purely for its game play and not the story.

\&gt; Then do it.

Turns out, we're both right. The first 50 hours of ARR is NOT necessary to enjoying FFXIV, however HW and SHB do matter a lot. Thanks for participating everyone!",46,1584907715,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fn68ed/ffxiv_minisurvey_results/,ffxiv,1

This post is about how my interactions have gone in light of my mental illness. 

I have borderline personality disorder with shades of bipolar disorder. Put simply, I have the mood swings you'd expect and also a lot of issues with anyone or anything even remotely resembling trauma I've gone through during my childhood. This disorder is the result of not having been able to get through those traumas that stunted my personality's development. That's why I can seem childish or abrasive at times. That's why I haven't lasted at a job for longer than four months. That's why I haven't finished college. 

You see, for me, the future looks hopeless and many situations feel hostile even when they aren't. I tend to project my expectation that I will be treated as worthless scum and I genuinely believe most people who know me would celebrate over a video of me cutting my wrists and dying. My disorder and its part in my interactions with others fuel these beliefs and solidify them, making any improvement seem impossible. Sometimes, I'll lash out when I don't mean to or my mood swings and outspoken nature will cause me to admit to things too heavy for others. Sometimes, I'll use morbid metaphors to try to explain my feelings. Nobody wants to deal with that in a game or otherwise. And so, I believe I should simply give up on everything that would allow me to have a meaningful life.  Now, most people will probably say I'm trolling, looking for attention or sympathy, or even that I'm trying to make others look bad. I'm not. But because I am the way I am, it's more difficult for me to get along with others. Because people come to this game to escape from reality, most do not want to deal with me. I would try to escape from reality as well, but the problem with that is a person is still himself or herself in a game as in real life. Playing a game does not mean you are now someone else entirely. Sure, one could endlessly role-play in the game, but that doesn't change the fact that it's the person, not the character, making those choices. In this way, one cannot escape from oneself in a game. I wish I could. 

So, because of my disability, I've been referred to using some pretty nasty things. People tend to react only to the face value of things. With someone like me, it's better to get to know the person despite that because often the face value is just a mask to hide what's going on. In my particular case, I'll seem angry but will be hurt, sad, depressed, frustrated, upset, and/or in despair.   
I know I'm not the only person who plays this game and has borderline personality disorder. I know I'm not the only person who plays this game and has a mental disorder of any type. As with real life, getting to know people means getting to know their difficulties. Sometimes, people come with unique rules to interact with them, like being patient with autistic people as they try to communicate or being comforting to the depressed because they can't always help it. 

I'm not trying to say you shouldn't play this game if you can't deal with people like me. It takes all kinds to make a world, after all. I am saying I wish people would be a little more understanding, though. I realize being on the Internet promotes negativity and indifference due to the supposed power of anonymity. But just as people have rallied around causes like Team Trees and defending communities against COVID-19, we should also try to remember that we are playing with other people, and other people may not always be what we might consider ""normal."" 

That's all I truly wish for.",37,1584880368,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmz8l2/my_experiences_with_ffxiv_and_mental_illness/,ffxiv,1

I just recently started playing on brand new trial account. I am super into the game, leveling like madman :)

Reaching my 30's, so I am preparing myself to upgrade from Trial version to Complete edition. (EU server btw)

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what product, and in a which way should I choose to upgrade. SE store page is a mess, really hard to choose right option.

\- 1st option: Via MogStation - option to upgrade to Complete, and transfer my character. Cost of the full game is 39.99 Euro (so it says)

\- 2nd option: Purchase currently discounted game via store for 19.99 and enter the code manually.

&amp;#x200B;

Would the 2nd option work and let me migrate my trial character? Does the complete edition cover some gametime also?",5,1584875829,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmydgi/trial_complete_upgrade_question/,ffxiv,1

fmy8j6,lo_lee_pop,New player! Need help ;-;,"Hello! I’m sorry idk if i’m doing this right, i’m pretty new to reddit and ffxiv (MMORPGs in general) and i’m looking for advice and tips :”))

I’ve started playing last week and I’ve instantly fell in love with the game and the healer role bit recently i’ve been getting anxiety over dungeons and trials due to two reasons:

1. Not being a good healer

I wanna become an effective healer but i know right now i SUCK at it, i want to become good but i tend to overheal (i panic easily because sometimes tanks go from full health to under 30% and that just drIVES ME INTO SPAMMING CURE)

I know healers are supposed to dps as well but i usually forget to do that when my eyes are always on the tank’s health bar. 

I also seem to get left by the party a lot, i always find myself trying to catch up to them then i see the tank getting hurt and some dps as well and im not even near them and i just p a n i c 

Any advice on that? ;-;


2. Being a first timer on everything

So one of the reason i really fell in love with ffxiv is for the lore, i take my SWEET SWEET TIME reading through the cutscenes but by my second dungeon i had people getting annoyed with me because i was still in a cutscene. From then on when i go to dungeons i skip everything and i just :(((. My next msq is a trial i think ? I have to fight titan and ive been holding it off for two days because im just afraid of not doing a good job i wish i knew what to do or how ro do my job right 

Sorry if my questions probably sound stupid. any advice harsh or not is appreciated :((( sorry if i sound like a noob because I honestly am, i’m not really a gamer, my only experience with games are mobile MOBAs",81,1584875070,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmy8j6/new_player_need_help/,ffxiv,1

fmwvuj,dracoeques,Would anyone happen to know of reliable resoures when it comes to the order of leveling for your DoH/DoL jobs to be most practical?,"It seems like the MSQs and dailies wlll power level you to max long before Shadowbringers is ever over (or started), and while you start getting your DoW/DoM job up to the minimum required level to start either of those usually seems like a good time to start experimenting with DoH/DoL. 

My question is: Is there a reliable guide that has a good strategy for leveling them in cooperation with one another? 

For example: carpentry is often one of the first trades suggested, but they actually rely on a lot of ""ingredients"" that botanists can gather. So I'm looking, essentially, for a guide that might say, ""Because you'll need plant x for Carpenter, you'll want to start with Botanist. But at Level 25, Botanist stops being necessary for Carpenter, so if you prefer Carpenter, feel free to focus on it for a while. You won't need anything else from Botanist until Level Such-and-Such, but you'll also need y from Weaver (which will need to be level 15 minimum)."" 

Do these exist? This is just my effort to find a good online manual so that I don't fritter away all my money unnecessarily on ingredients at the marketboards, and also an effort to maximize my playing time. 

Thanks so much for your thoughts.",7,1584867122,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmwvuj/would_anyone_happen_to_know_of_reliable_resoures/,ffxiv,1
fmwmqa,sillieranimal1,"Need the thoughts of people who played Stormblood during Patch cycle, and those who played through it all at once. Spoilers abound.","I ask because I need to see if my ungodly hatred of Stormblood is justified or not.  I started FF14 2 days before ShB came out so I played all the way through to ShB without having to deal with a patch cycle, and Stormblood honest to god almost made me quit the game by itself.  What I want to know is, if you liked the expansion, why, and if you disliked it, why.

I have many reasons why I hate this xpac so I'm just gonna list them out, and feel free to call me out on anything thats too unfair.

Lyse is a terrible character and having her be the center focus was just mind numbingly boring and aggravating.  From just being in-competent through the entire story, and even into the patch cycle she continues to just be a screw up and she forgives everyone of their horrible transgressions.

Gosetsu and Yotsuyu's characters had a pretty good send off but then their character arcs are completely nullified at the start of 5.X.

Gotsetsu completes his heroes journey by sacrificing himself to save his ward and complete the foreshadowing you see in the highlands of him contemplating his own death and the meaning of it.  But no, him and Yotsuyu make it away scott free after being crushed by 20 tons of ruffle and drowning to death.  also make it off a deserted island, some how.

Then Yotsuyu was brought back because this is a japanese game and every single evil person needs a redemptive arc because they were sad once in their life, which justifies the thousands of murders they committed.  Like fucking come on, I swear at the end of 6.X Zenos will have a redemptive arc and become one of the bros.

Now this one might be me, but I dont like anything from Gyr Albania or Othard.  Gyr is just another desert like thanalan and suffers from fallout 3's single colour palate of brown.  And the far east is just ye old japan but shittier.

Zenos is a shitty villian to rival the stories shitty main character.  Zenos' entire character is that he's bored.  That its.  He doesnt care about anything in the story except fighting you and thats only halfway through the story.  He's literally the writers edgy OC please do not steal character.

I have so many more thoughts but I'd like to keep this somewhat short.  Also lets try and keep thoughts to the main story, not Omega stuff cause thats secondary.",29,1584865597,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmwmqa/need_the_thoughts_of_people_who_played_stormblood/,ffxiv,1

I've just joined FFXIV after 12y of WoW, and I'm looking for some context comparative to my experience.

What I'm looking for is someone who transitioned like I did, whom can clarify me of the main differences and cliff warnings to someone in this game transition.

What are the common pitfalls a TBC+ player would fall into?

What are the things a WoW player would tend to ignore that are actually relevant?

In-game community guidelines behavior that might differ?

In WoW the activity I must enjoyed after a break was spending a couple hours remaking my UI to my current preferences/priorities, is there any way or recommended add-ons to do this?

Particularly the player interaction during the latter was great, it started out by a veteran player asking if there was anybody who was doing this for the first time. So I went through the cutscene in the first turn and lo and behold, all the veteran players were sitting and waiting for the new people to finish the cutscene. 

As someone who’s never liked MMOs cause I hate the competitive toxic BS that plagued them and I’m more of a fan of story driven games, I’m very surprised by my experience so far with the player base in this game who seem to genuinely want to help new players learn and grow.

Thanks to everyone who’s letting people like me get to experience the story without the added pressure of feeling like I have to skip stuff.

fmtf76,Ziloren,Question about 'Tales of Adventure',"I own all the expansions, but have only completed the first one so far and have not yet done the massive amount of quests required to unlock Foundation, and with it access to the Astrologian class.     
     
However, I was wondering if I could purchase  "" Tales of Adventure: One Astrologian's Journey II ""  and have instant access to the Astrologian, without having to unlock the area it is from yet.     
     
 I think I read elsewhere that someone claimed to have done so, but I think they also bought the story line unlock to grant access to the area.. but did not yet meet the character level required to pick up Astrologian legitimately.  So I wanted conformation of if the area/story needed completed to that point before the Tales of Adventure: One Astrologian's Journey II would work.

This feeling has just gotten stronger after seeing all the wonderful artwork and screenshots of people and their groups hanging out and just having fun. 

I've considered if maybe RP would be a good way of find a group of my own but I'm really not quite sure where to even approach the ""task"" from. 

I know this might come off as a bit sad that I have trouble finding friends but any advice would be welcome, even if it's just how you managed to find your ""pack"".

fmrpb0,Leidiriv,"Since Chemist is such a popular idea for a new healer, I decided to try and flesh out a kit for it myself","note: to keep things from being confused with Alchemist, I renamed the class to Medicus but at its core it is still Chemist.

Story: In an effort to prove Pureblood Garlean supremacy, certain factions among the Optimates endeavored to create a method of sustaining troops on the battlefield to phase out the need for savages to wield magicks. Luckily for those attempting to push into Garlemald, the designs for this equipment were intercepted by Populares spies and distributed to the Garlond Ironworks to better arm the Eorzean soldiers.

A question that I do have is: should I try a dps character in heavensward? 
I've always played as a tank (warrior and more recently I've been leveling up a DRK to 50) because I like the fast queues and I get a feeling of importance while doing group content. So, I'm a bit worried about the queues as a dps, and the fact that it may be more difficult to level it up than a tank.

I've always leveled up my tanks through the daily roulettes. Is there a more effective way to level up a dps?

fmfa1n,OlivinePeridot,AMA - XIV Climbers (Deep Dungeon Solo Rankers and Speedrunners),"Hello Warriors of Light and/or Darkness!

As a subreddit, we have invited a few community figureheads to use our platform to answer some of your burning questions in the past, such as [MrHappy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/a81uhy/ama_mrhappy/), [Ariyala](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3psv48/ama_ariyalas_ffxiv_toolkit/), [Aetherflow Media](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/azvt92/ama_aetherflow_media/) and [The Balance](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcg6uc/ama_the_balance/). Today we're inviting a group of renowned streamers from the Deep Dungeon Solo Clear and Ranking/Speedrunning community, XIV Climbers!

Deep Dungeon is a unique type of content in Final Fantasy XIV. Not only can it be wicked difficult, it encourages and rewards solo play with [ranked job leader boards](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/ranking/deepdungeon/). But a Lone Hero is never truly alone - in the shadow of Heaven-on-High, a budding community has emerged to uncover the secrets of Deep Dungeon and help each other overcome them. These guys work tirelessly to clear both Heaven-on-High and Palace of the Dead solo on every single job, stretching their kits to the limit and rationing pomanders like the last roll of toilet paper. And when one false step can end a 200 floor climb and a single job adjustment can completely change the meta, there's no doubt these guys know what they're doing.

Allow us to introduce the four streamers that will be participating in this AMA:

**u/Allythia** [[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/allythia)]

Hey there! I'm Allythia and I often run and occasionally stream Deep Dungeon solo.

I initially had interest in soloing back in early 2018 out of a general curiosity and it ended up becoming a passion of mine. After clearing both Deep Dungeons on RDM, I made a goal to beat out the impossible and clear both of these on every job, but I took a long hiatus not too long after HoH was released due to a number of disconnects that killed my overall motivation. I ended up coming back last summer after seeing a couple of people streaming unconventional jobs which reignited my passion, and I've been running consistently ever since.

Here's my own personal accomplishments with my journey thus far:

* World 4th PotD
* World 1st HoH
* World's 1st and only Tank HoH Solo Clear pre-ShB (WAR)

Other notable HoH clears and world rankings: I have cleared 15/17 jobs solo, everything outside of SCH and AST, with World 1sts on RDM, WHM, MNK, DRG, DNC (my main &lt;3).

Other notable PotD clears and world rankings: I have cleared 13/17 jobs solo, everything outside of WHM, SCH, AST, and BLM (world record at 189) with world 1sts on DRK, WAR, SAM, DRG, MNK, DNC, BRD.

**u/Angelusdemonus** [[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/angelusdemonus/)]

Hello everyone, I am Angelus Demonus. I stream on twitch predominantly deep dungeon solo content on almost all the days I go live. 

I started doing Deep Dungeon Solo almost right out of the gate back in 3.35, and most of my motivation came from the fact that they had a leaderboard... so I was in it for the competition and a place on said leaderboards. Once they started to introduce the solo achievement for clear Palace of the Dead Floor 200, I dedicated much of my time working towards a solo clear; this was around the time RDM had been introduced and learning that RDM had a very good kit to potentially solo. Regrettably, I had given up on the quest for a number of months until the release of Heaven on High which rekindled my interest in clearing. Since then, you can find me almost always in a deep dungeon instance most of the week, haha.

My accomplishments in solo deep dungeon include:

* World 6th ""Lone Hero"" HoH Solo Clear
* World 14th~ ""Necromancer"" PoTD Solo Clear
* World 1st Gunbreaker HoH Solo Clear
* World 2nd Dancer HoH Clear
* ""Necromancer"" Title on all 3 NA Data Centers
* 9 different classes solo cleared in HoH (PLD/WAR/DRK/GNB/MCH/BRD/DNC/SMN/RDM), 11 times total (2 on RDM, 2 on GNB)

I've also heard a ton of feedback on my videos on twitch/youtube of people watching them and getting success on their own attempts. It's been pretty awesome seeing overtime how many people have been learning and trying deep dungeon solo, and more importantly seeing people getting their clears, and I hope I hear more of your stories in the future!

**u/Fahros** [[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/fahros)]

Hey dudes, I’m Fahros. I’m a full time partnered streamer on Twitch, and I’ve recently fallen in love with competitive Deep Dungeoning in FFXIV. I used to stream PuG Savage Raiding and the occasional Ultimate, but I have found a new love climbing the leaderboards of HoH and PotD. I haven’t been at it as long as some of these other guys, but I’m working hard to not let that hold me back.

I’ve done pretty good for myself with the time I’ve had with the content. My accomplishments include:

* I’ve Cleared Heaven on High solo 4 different times with the 4 different tanks.
* 5th Place worldwide score for Warrior Solo HoH @ Floor 100.
* Former world record holder for team score in HoH.
* 4th Place worldwide score for Blackmage Solo PotD @ Floor 170.
* 5th Place worldwide score for Gunbreaker Solo PotD @ Floor 180.
* Working on my first PotD 1-200 solo right now.

All of which have been done live on stream, and I’d love to see you there for future runs! Cheers!

**u/Maygii** [[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maygii)]

Hi everyone! I'm Maygi and some may know me for writing the [Palace of the Dead](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV_SIs5L9kD_NHO2ZsU4Tw8R6iQ4v1RC5fZPQqK6cD8/edit) and [Heaven-on-High](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YVBSTOgJO-xOAB6YyKZEZRikjXFPle6Ihf_E7VdmQnI/edit) guides :3
Deep dungeon is the most interesting content in the game for me by far - while raiding is nice and all, fights in raids are more or less static and just need a bit of memorization, but in Deep Dungeons, you never know what to expect and often wind up in scenarios that require split second decision making. It really drew me into the game back in Heavensward, when soloing seemed like an impossible feat - which was my motivation to conquer it! I wrote these guides to be able to share my experience with others and get more people involved in soloing, as it's one of the most exciting pieces of content in the game that more people should give a try!

While I haven't run through as many jobs as some other soloers nowadays, some of my notable achievements include:

* World 2nd Palace of the Dead Solo (on RDM)
* World 1st non-RDM Heaven-on-High clear (BRD)
* World 1st SCH Palace of the Dead Solo

I don't stream too often but when I do, feel free to stop by!

Nier Automata

Planetscape Torment

Final Fantasy XIV

Some background: I'm a HUGE final fantasy fan, and recently tried but couldn't get into Divinity: OS2. I have these other games to try, but   wasn't sure which to give a shot next. I also loved Xenogears and the   Metal Gear series, as well as the Chrono series. I prefer jRPGs.

I've played pretty much every other FF, and wanted to try FFXIV, but I heard the ARR/base game are a slog and the real meat is 100 hours later once into the expansions, which just seems like a massive time investment for a game that's an MMO and may not entirely be focused on story. For me, the story is really important.

Basically at this point trying to decide my next game and time investment, so hope to hear your guys thoughts, thanks!",18,1584779515,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fmbx01/how_would_you_compare_ffxivs_story_to_these_other/,ffxiv,1

fma205,djensen1997,[END-GAME DISCUSSION] NA PF: We can do better regarding e8s!,"Look, NA, I know we all want to greed, I'll be the first to admit I'm greedy af but we have to stop with this uptime mirror mirror 4 strat.  It is too risky for the minor reward we get out of it. Honestly, how much extra dmg are you as a tank or melee going to do to the boss if you don't move during mirror mirror 4? Half a GCD? Maybe a full GCD? And all of this while also continuing to use Forsaken and Ilya strat, the latter having been denounced by the very person who created it.

PF pugs require a strategy which has uptime in mind from the conception of the strategy in order to maintain uptime, which is why even though some tanks and melee are capable of keeping uptime in Ilya or Forsaken, most party finder players are not able to.  So instead of using one of those strategies, why don't we all take the time to learn one one of the bowtie strats such as [Xenosys's Bowtie Strat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBNXo8RrwJo).  Switching to this strat will give the average melee and tank 3-5 extra GCDs over Ilya or Forsaken strat while also boasting more consistency than the ""uptime"" mirror mirror 4 strategy that has been used in pf until now.

Also, moving the boss does not equal a loss of uptime, using [this mirror mirror 4 stragegy](https://ff14.toolboxgaming.space/?id=13896689574851&amp;preview=1) which puts the boss in a place such that if you have the ping and reaction time required to pull off the current ""uptime"" mirror strat, you can still flex that, but if you do not, you are only punished with being push across the arena, a knockback that can be dashed out of btw.",28,1584768520,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fma205/endgame_discussion_na_pf_we_can_do_better/,ffxiv,1

fm9t2o,crabbyconnorbomb,Game is ignoring existing files and completely reinstalling.,"Since I'm gonna be home for a while due to this....shall I say.... worldwide situation right now, I figured I should install the game onto my desktop, which is also more powerful. But, as my life usually is, easy tasks always take longer than they should.

For some odd reason the launcher is straight up ignoring the existing game files. Since downloading 20 some gb of files would take hours for me, I did what any sane person would do and copied the entire 20 some gig ffxiv folder from my laptop onto my external hard drive, then I copied that folder from my hdd onto my steam folder on my PC. Keep in mind that the location where I put the folder is   
 the same where the game usually gets installed.

I then hit install on steam, and steam clearly saw all the files, it downloaded 19 mb for something, and said ready to play. Now the F'n irritating part (And the reason I am making this post): After I launched the game and signed in, lo and behold it's beginning to download the files....that are already there. We're talking a 30 gb download file it was trying to do.

 [in this image](https://prnt.sc/rk0md0) is the game folder that steam clearly sees but the launcher annoyingly doesn't. The folder size is the same as what it's trying to install. Has anyone else done what I'm trying to do before and know how I can fix it. (Without having to redownload everything please!)

TL:DR: Having trouble copying game folder from another pc.",2,1584767190,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fm9t2o/game_is_ignoring_existing_files_and_completely/,ffxiv,1

fm8xg9,Teinya,FFXIV Appreciation,"After a slow 2-3 months beginning, and a faster-paced subsequent month, I no longer have a main story quest to immediately pick up. It feels good to have finally caught up, but at the same time, it's saddening that I have to wait for the next patch to continue the story.  
I have never been more invested in an *MMO*'s story and its characters. The story progression has been both humorously entertaining and emotionally heavy. The character growth is existent and well developed which is rare for the genre. Shadowbringers especially brought a unique theme with it that I thoroughly enjoyed. The new Trust system helps so much with the immersion while also allowing newbies to run things blind with no consequences from others.  
All-in-all, it's been an amazing journey these past 4 months, and there's still so much left to do. Just wanted to voice my appreciation for the game as I sit here in my newfound feeling of accomplishment and void in my heart. For those who'd like to share, I would like to hear your own experiences and impressions about the game - I'm especially keen on seeing some perspectives from veterans.",4,1584762900,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fm8xg9/ffxiv_appreciation/,ffxiv,1

fm50qm,Atoozee,Question/Rant about Square Enix very strange (and horrible) customer service.,"So, I wanted to purchase Shadowbringers, and I saw there was a 50% sale, so I deciced to take the opportunity.

I did not realize my account was stated as ""Standard (Steam)"" in the mogstation. So, I bought the non-steam version of Shadowbringers. To my knowledge there was NOT a clear indication that there were was a difference between steam and non-steam users.

I know I'm technically in the wrong here for not doing enough research, but as a company they should make their purchases more clear to avoid further confusions like this..

Currently, I'm contacting their very horrible customer support system to try to get my money back, or get the correct version of my purchase. 

If that fails, (which I think it might, considering my experience with Square Enix so far) I want to know if it's possible to switch my game from Standard (Steam) to just Standard?

I realized that i have to feed him the fruits in an spesific order, so i found this calculator  [https://ffxivchocobo.com/](https://ffxivchocobo.com/)  and followed its structions in order to change it from Ochi Green, to Sooth Black.

Im pretty sure that i followed the feeding order perfectly, however the bird instead changed from ochi green, to hunter green.

I main healing, but I usually stick to White Mage. 

Below is my current hotbar layout for straight up keyboard usage. 

The bottom row is 1 to =  
The middle row is shift + 1 to =  
the top row is alt + 1 to =  
and the side cluster is set up to use F1 to F4 and then my limit is on ctrl + g

My new computer arrived today and after setting it all up and reinstalling the game I fired it up.  Ul'dah was popping with details I didn't really know were there and when I stepped out into Central Thanalan and saw grass, shadows, and the detail on the surface of the water for the first time I was blown away.

Firstly, is this free trial level capped? Or is it X days? I can't find anywhere in the client or in-game that tells me when the free trial ends, and idk if I'm missing content for not having the full version.

Then, I'm also confused about what to buy exactly. I've seen that you can buy the game, but also that there's a monthly suscription... Mind explaining how that works exactly?

And finally, I'm really enjoying the game but I'm a mostly PVE enjoyer. Problem I've had on some MMORPGs is that endgame is very PVP oriented, and I end up getting bored of it because what I enjoy most is PVE (dungeons and such). So, is there enough PVE content to keep me satisfied?

fly2tb,Riyujin26,TEA gear question - ilvl sync is 475 - 470 VS 480 ?,"We plan to try TEA ""soon"".

I'm doing a bit of preps, I've read that it's generally better to take the previous gear for melds because they get removed from ilvl sync down.

However for this one the sync is 475, and only the weapon has a ilvl 475 (edengrace).

If i take ilvl 480 I should be able to get more raw stats (cap à i475) than the ilvl 470 right?

&amp;#x200B;

Which one would be best then?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand :

\- ilvl 470 = less main/sub stats BUT you keep your melds = good for substats optimization

\- ilvl 480 = more main/sub stats due to ilvl sync down to 475 BUT you can't adjust your substats",10,1584722278,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fly2tb/tea_gear_question_ilvl_sync_is_475_470_vs_480/,ffxiv,1

I'm completely new to this game so forgive my stupidity...

Me and a friend started play FF14 this month and I started as a lancer and he started as an archer. We did this to start in the same area.

I was hoping I could be a marauder long term but have no idea how I go about changing/adding classes.

Any advice or help would be appreciated on this.

So my question is, at what point does Summoner really start to feel good? I'm also constantly debating with myself If I just wanna finish the MSQs with Ninja or take my Summoner through. I'm struggling because right now Summoner doesn't feel too great while Ninja does, however I know that summoner will be really good later and I just wanna summon Bahamut and Phoenix lol.

flruem,No311,FFXIV returner questions,"Hello! 

With the current quarantine, my plans of returning to FFXIV (after not having played since Heavensward) have become a higher priority.

I have, however, not kept up to date with any developments. I was wondering about a few things:

1. Since I haven't played for so long, I was thinking of going through the story again. To that end, I could start a new character. However, I have some sweet stuff on my old character, as it is a 1.0 Legacy character and I am somewhat attached to it. I know you can switch worlds and am willing to do so. I the phantasia exist and have one. Is there also a way to reset all your levels and the story mode?
2. I do not have a computer, but as there are by now more than a handful of games I want to play on Playstation, I wanted to go the PS4 route (I'm not waiting for the PS5 due to reasons). What stuff is absolutely necessary for the optimal FFXIV experience on playstation? I have a USB mouse and Keyboard. I do not have a headset.

If you have any other tips that would help, I would love to hear them.

Thanks,

Someone who has frankly missed FFXIV for the past few years. (I'm serious, I've even kept up to date with the soundtrack.)",25,1584694783,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/flruem/ffxiv_returner_questions/,ffxiv,1

I have done full reinstalls of everything, down to the OS.

I have tried both versions of the logitech software, the gsuite and the gaming software.

The only fix is unplugging the mouse and plugging it back in, and this issue only presents itself with FFXIV.

flpgbu,nublargh,"Expert crafting strat (stats, action priorities, demo video)","First: the video

https://streamable.com/0vr9l

using this strat i've consistently made 25k~32k points per hour, averaged out over 80 hours of crafting.  

Not everything will cap out, some will straight out fail.  
Maybe you can spend more time on each craft to increase the chances of capping, but the precious time doing that could've been spent running 2 and craft instead.

I'm sure that this isn' the best method there is and that more crafters will come out with their own strats since the ranking period is over, but it's served me well allowing me to accumulate over 2 million total points during the ranking period.

Stats used in this video:  
2510 cms  
2549 control  
555 cp
(before buffs)

Buffs used:  
HQ Blood Bouillabaisse  
HQ Cunning Craftsman's Syrup  
FC action In Control II  
Specialization Soul Crystal


strat:

```
progress opener:
  open with MuMe, Rapid Synth (with MuMe buff), Veneration, Rapid Synth (with Veneration buff)
  this puts you 1 Basic Synth from completion with 2510 cms.
  if you don't have 2510, you'll need 1 more Basic Synth

  if rapid keeps failing and MuMe buff falls off, quit.
  if rapid keeps failing and step count is above 15, quit.

  if Pliant comes up during MuMe buff, only risk 1 Manip, ignore the rest until the first Rapid is done.
  if Pliant comes up during Veneration buff, take it (Manip or MM as needed).

  after pulling off the first Rapid, get Inner Quiet up
  if Good comes up and you've already pulled off the first Rapid: Tricks of the Trade
  if Good comes up and you've already pulled off the first Rapid and Inner Quiet is up: Precise Touch
  if Sturdy comes up and you've already pulled off the first Rapid and Inner Quiet is up and durability ends with 0 or 5: Prudent Touch
  if Sturdy comes up and you've already pulled off the first Rapid and Inner Quiet is up and durability doesn't end with 0 or 5: Basic Touch

then it's prudent spam:
  - if condition is good and IQ is below 10: Precise Touch
  - if condition is sturdy and durability ends with 0 or 5: Prudent Touch
  - if condition is sturdy and durability doesn't end with 0 or 5: Prep Touch
  - if condition is sturdy and durability doesn't end with 0 or 5 but not enough durability for Prep: Basic Touch
  - if condition is pliant and durability &gt;= 30 and no Manip (or Manip at 2 or below): Manipulation
  - if condition is pliant and durability &lt; 30: Master's Mend
  - if condition is centered and durability is above 30: Hasty Touch
  - if durability is below 20: Master's Mend
  - if condition is normal, IQ stack is at least 8, and you have enough CP (and durability) for finisher, 4 more Prudents, and Innovation: Innovation
    - during Innovation, if condition is good: Prudent Touch
    - during Innovation, if condition is sturdy: Prep Touch
  - otherwise, if condition is good: Tricks of the Trade
  - in all other situations: Prudent Touch
  - if durability is above 11 and there's not enough CP for Prudent: Hasty
  - if there is only enough durability for finisher but there's some CP to spare: use Observe while keeping enough CP for 2 Observes during finisher

keep 74 CP for finisher: Inno, GS, Byregot's Blessing

during finisher, when Inno (with at least 3 turns) is up but not GS and you have spare dur or CP (from Manip or Tricks) use Hasty/Basic/Prudent.
during finisher, when Inno and GS are up and you have spare CP, use Observe (up to 2) and try to land Byregot's Blessing on Good

Can this strat be used with lower stats?

Definitely yes, but you'll just end up with lower points per hour.  
You'll get fewer capped quality crafts, you'll fail more, but don't worry about the RNG, randomness always flattens out over a large sample size, and the final metric that you should care about is points per hour.",26,1584681935,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/flpgbu/expert_crafting_strat_stats_action_priorities/,ffxiv,1

fldb4u,Bodymindisoneword,Having a problem and lowering my graphics advice requested. ps - Am I crazy?,"Here is the rub, my NVIDIA card is old and occasionally I get a disco's due to a fatal error. I also have a very jumpy screen when around large crowds of other players (think near the Aether Crystal in big cities). 

This is not the problem nor the sanity question. 

Now doing higher level dungeons the boss mechanics are multiple and often times more than one is happening at the same time. 

I rock at grids, cones, circle aoe's, linear telegraphed mechanics but there are two problems. 

Explosions and swipes, I swear I get out of the telegraphed zones albeit sometimes just in time and others by a good measure and yet I get hit. 

I tried to compensate and get as far as possible but sometimes they appear right under you and go gotta hull ass. 

I play with my Husband and I started to suspect this may be another way shitty graphics (maybe CPU) are affecting my game. twice last night while in a duty I was out of the telegraph swipe on my screen and NOT on his screen. ???

I realize this sounds like I am making excuses so I am looking for three things. 

I lowered all my settings to normal, off, or as low as they can go and I reinstalled my graphics card. Is there anything else I can do?


Is there a place I can practice getting out of dodge outside of a duty? (golden saucer?)

Am I simply a poop player lol. 

This only became an issue when the mechanics included swipes and explosions other than the duty with giant book that opens and closes, even on the best PC I would hate that fight.",17,1584636749,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fldb4u/having_a_problem_and_lowering_my_graphics_advice/,ffxiv,1

fl8rn5,eikeleele,PvP in FFXIV,"Hi to everybody!

I just joined the community to ask a basic question about PvP but first the background:

In the past I played a lot of WoW (~7-8k hours) but i barely played BfA because I can't stand decisions of Blizzard and the game is not the same anymore. I have to do so much stuff I don't like and invest so much time to keep up competitive play that I quitted that month. 

So I searched a lot of reddit posts and videos on YouTube and heard a lot of positive feedback about FFXIV. I also want to play PvE but my main focus always was PvP. I heard the PvE combat system is the best but PvP has its own system and that is really simplified and FFXIV does not shine at PvP because of that. So PvP is not that great and feels repetitive pretty fast.

Is that still the case? Are there any changes in progress I don't know of? Opinions from experienced players? Maybe comparisons of WoW?

Thanks in advance!",48,1584618678,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fl8rn5/pvp_in_ffxiv/,ffxiv,1

After DPS-ing for a bit to get my feet wet with the game, I'd like to test out healing and/or tanking. However, I'm playing via a controller and I'm noticing that my default settings on my D-pad don't seem to do what I hear it should do online.

I've heard it said that up/down and left/right cycle through your allies or enemies. But whenever I use any of those directions, my targeting seems to cycle through both enemies *and* allies indiscriminately. Sometimes every second in a battle counts, and I'm spending too much time reacting to whether the target I've pulled up is the right one since they're all mixed in together.

Is there a good fix for this? 

And, as a follow-up question, is there any rhyme or reason to which enemy it pulls up first? For instance, if you press up, is it supposed to bring up the first allied party member while down brings up the last?

fl1m57,volstedgridban,Aetherochemical Compound #666 can eat a dick,"Seriously, what does it take to catch this fucker?

I have spent a total of at least 12 hours sitting in this pond of chemical sludge trying to catch the little bastard, and no dice.

I've burned through at least 80 HQ Cordials.

I've only actually hooked him like 7 times in those 12 hours, and he's gotten away every time.

I used fiend worms to try and catch the Platinum Fish, because that's what ff14angler.com and garlandtools.com both say to use.  But I only hook a Platinum Fish around 35% of the time with the fiend worm bait.

So I tried swapping to a versatile lure.  Which is exactly as effective as the fiend worm (which is to say, it isn't particularly effective).  

I have tried popping Patience II + Fish Eyes to get a better chance of HQ Platinum Fish.  Under optimal circumstances, where I will hook as many HQ Platinum Fish as I can within the 2m 20sec time window of those two buffs, I can hook **3** HQ Platinum Fish.  So a maximum of three attempts to hook the Aetherochemical Compound 666.

And that's only happened twice.  In 12 hours of trying.

After I spent a few hours fruitlessly blowing through HQ Cordials to no result, I changed tactics and just started doing the Fish Eyes buff and relying on the RNG to pop an HQ Platinum Fish.  This was just as ineffective as the other way, but was much more frustrating, so I didn't stick with it.

Normally when I get a Heavy (!!!) tug while I've got Patience II running, I use the Powerful Hookset.  But Garlandtools and the Carby fishing site both say to use the Precision Hookset.  So I tried that too, and it didn't work either.  The fish still got away.

I'm at my wits' end.  Advice and/or prayers on my behalf urgently requested.",30,1584582207,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fl1m57/aetherochemical_compound_666_can_eat_a_dick/,ffxiv,1

3rd guy NUKE fast. 4th guy NUKE.

I got 4th guy to 25% with **50% echo.** 

So yes in theory you can. if I had to guess phase 3 being don't get 3 stacks and go to last fan. A bit simple. Also that stack thing HURTS.

fkw0ki,anonvalisanon,Get Alternative Contact Info for Your FFXIV Friends,"Hiya -

Lots of bad stuff happening in the world right now. Lots of fear and anxiety, lots of bunkering and waiting. Lots of necessary life adjustments because of RL disruptions.

Many folks don't know others personally in online games, but still have friendships in them, often spanning the world. Get Discord info or an email or a phone number or something so if bad stuff happens, word can get to your FC/friends and people aren't left wondering, worrying for the worst. If you're in a (few) Discord(s) already, you're probably good. Not everyone uses that service or stays logged in if they do, though.

(FYI: Discord has ramped their capacity recently specifically to help with communications, so that may be all you need!)

We don't truly know how much our friendships impact our lives until those friends are gone or radio silent. Even if it's just having to move somewhere temporarily or being carer for a relative, etc, there's so much happening that any assurance that our friends are well is a good thing.

Story:

A DPS in my old WoW guild was in a bad spot several years ago, had taken hiatus from the game abruptly. A bit later he was texting a worried guildmate with concerning stuff, and by Googling the area code of their number and then calling the PD of that county, was able to get an officer to his house for a check. He got super pissed and caused a lot of drama and quit the guild (and then the game), but he was alive to do so. We never learned if he was acting out or not, but no regrets.

Anyway - we live in quite interesting times and if you have friends in online games, consider taking steps so they know you're okay - they will/are likely worry(ing) about you.",4,1584561540,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fkw0ki/get_alternative_contact_info_for_your_ffxiv/,ffxiv,2

Botanist -

/gs change (Botanist Gearset #) &lt;wait.1&gt;

Will never see you out of the stage

Failing once more to escape the prison

Falling back into pieces again

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk5lscNzIio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pk5lscNzIio)

If I am a DPS and not getting the tether for tower, the way how Forsaken strat work is that those without tether would be at Cardinals. If I got the North tether for say, I would be going South and vice versa if I am south. After the first tower explode, the DPS not baiting the orb would stand at the cardinal tower and the South &amp; North players baiting the orb would stand on the tower and after the tower explode they will pop the orb.

I can't compare myself to other classes because they each hit differently at different skill and ilvls. I can't compare myself to others of my class, because their gear my be better, or they may be a more skillful player, in which case I'll fall short anyway.

fkpt0m,TychosofNaglfar,How has your view on each Scion changed from ARR through Shadowbringers?,"Greetings, fellow travellers. Are you passing through from boredom of self isolation or quarantine? Rest a spell and share with me your thoughts on something fun: The Scions. I want you all to list each Scion and your initial feelings on them and then your feelings now. For me?
 
Papalymo: Starting as a lancer, he and Yda were the first I met. I thought and still think they had the best dynamic as they felt like a real duo. I also forgot his name and when my friend asked, I called him Papa Coolio which I continue to do till this day. Now he is truly in a Lala's Paradise... I began to really respect him by the end (especially having the stones to shunt me away and onto the ship.) He started off as just ""The straight man"" and evolved and ended as the stern father of the Scions in my eyes. Rest in peace, Papa Coolio.
 
Yda/Lyse: Again, met her first because of my start and she actually sort of annoyed me. The ditzy ones usually do... But she was fun, she had so much damn energy and her smile when fighting just brightened my day. The bubbly little sister of the Scions... Until she turned into Lyse. Jesus Christ, the tonal shift in her character was so sudden. It went from ""bubbly little sister"" to ""bossy and moody little sister."" I guess losing Papa was hard on her...
 
Thancred: I liked Thancred from the moment I met him as we both had similar hair and class (until he swapped like 9 times) and he had this Balthier-esque suaveness to him. Needless to say I thought of him as the older brother of the Scions. Honestly, he's the only one that hasn't really changed my outlook on him. I guess most people think of him as a dad now with Ryne, but to me he's still that same uber capable older brother that you can rely on to sneak into the enemy territory and nick some information and crisps for you after bedtime.
 
Urianger: I NEVER trusted this big lanky bastard. From his hooded appearance and indirect manner of speaking to the weird side glare that Minfillia gave him upon his introduction (was I imagining that? It's been a while.) Also never doing most of the ex primals in those days, he remained a huge mystery until it turned out I was RIGHT not to trust him. I didn't like him all the way until Shadowbringers where he begged for forgiveness and promised to stick with me through the end. In that moment it made me realize how important his friendship with the WoL is and how much we mean to him. Creepy, but sincere uncle Urianger ended Shadowbringers with more of my respect than ever.
 
Y'shtola: I loved her dynamic with Thancred, but the entire Titan questline made my eyes roll and her snappy attitude just wasn't helping. I liked her, though. The bossy older sister of the Scions until Heavensward and on. I was sort of worried about her and how she seemed to harden and what that meant for her. Well it turns out she was just becoming the hot mama of the Scions. Seriously it went from ""meh"" to ""Holy shit she's attractive and just threatened to bend me over her knee."" I also enjoy how she's a lot more straightforward and goal oriented than most. Keeps us on track in a stern yet strangely arousing way.
 
Alphinaud: He was absolutely fucking insufferable to me. His know it all BS made me want to powerbomb him through the fucking floor. I even got a sick kick out of his Crystal Braves betraying him... Then they cut off my main bro Raubahn's arm and I felt like shit all around. Heavensward and on, he's really humbled up and it gave him so much more personality. Of course it could've always been there and my eyes were too busy glazing over to see. Now I enjoy being with him and his sister and even sometimes wanna protect him from her. The maturing little brother of the Scions.
 
Alisae: Didn't do raids, so I had no clue she'd pop back up. That being said, her ""this is useless, I'm gonna go get results"" attitude is something I approved of. And now? Oh boy. She's the most aggro Scion and boy do I love it because it's soooo different and fresh than the others. No diplomacy, no sneaky infiltration, just a kick to the bollocks and a face full of fire! Also I think it's absolutely adorable how much she idolizes the WoL. I see her as a spunky cousin of the Scions since she really hasn't been around me as long as the others in my mind. Sorta like Scrappy Doo, I guess.
 
Minfillia:... I got nothing. Sorry. I really felt nothing and no connection to this character. Her passing only struck a chord with me through the sorrow it caused to everyone else around me. I even feel kinda bad typing that =/
 
 

 
Well, there ya go. That's my take on the Scions and thanks for reading through. I'd like to hear yours and whar you think/thought of them all. Please. Isolation is lonely and my queue times are long.",81,1584539413,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fkpt0m/how_has_your_view_on_each_scion_changed_from_arr/,ffxiv,1

fkmb3s,Zero8000,"FFXIV on Steam stuck at ""Preparing files for install"""," Hello there. I'm a relatively new player, started out last month as a Gladiator, and decided to take up other jobs such as Pugilist (because I do prefer a DPS-based class) and Arcanist (because my crew needed a healer, and I'm told Scholar's a pretty fun one). I started out via the free trial, and bought the game when I got to around level 15 with the Gladiator job. However, Steam for some reason doesn't recognize the free trial files as... well, game files. I figured out I could play anyway via the exectuable in the Free Trial folder, but it's a temporary solution as the game still believes I'm in a free trial, as one of my friends ended up discovering shortly after.  


Now, I deleted the Free Trial files completely. But I am now faced with a different problem. When trying to install the actual full game, it... doesn't work. Much like the title says, it's just stuck at preparing the files for install. I already turned off my antivirus to no avail, and I'm fairly certain my drivers are up to date, as I did so like a week ago due to an unrelated problem.

fkm8sd,dracoeques,Personal preference question: maxing out jobs on a single character vs playing as alts,"Hey, everyone. Sprout here.

Quick question:

Is there anything to be gained by maxing out jobs for a single character (achievements etc.)?

I ask because I'm conflicted right now in how to approach this game. Personally, I love customization in MMORPGs. Distinguishing yourself for me gives a game a lot of replay value. Given the races, archetypes, jobs themselves, starting world, grand companies, free companies, personal chocobos, etc, etc. the game has a lot of potential.

So I'm tempted to do multiple playthroughs with different characters in different jobs, but beforehand wanted to check to see if there are extra fun things in the later game I'd be missing out on if I didn't max out every job (or almost every job).

Where does your own personal preference fall? Do you stick with a single character or do you design several?",13,1584520007,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fkm8sd/personal_preference_question_maxing_out_jobs_on_a/,ffxiv,1

I use mopi mopi for my parser and am having some unusual issues after today’s updates. My act is parsing just fine but the overlay will not register anything it just sits on the home screen. I’ve made sure that the loop back IPs are the same and ACT isn’t blocked through my firewall and is set to Admin. 
Anyone have any idea how to fix this? Very frustrating.

fkjq4y,darkstrx,Why even play if you're gonna just be a jerk?,"I've never understood the mentality of people who need to be jerks for no reason.    


Doing weekly normal raids.  On E8 normal.  Duty commences, I'm tanking, I pull as soon as it drops.  See the other tank has started a countdown after I have engaged the boss.  He provokes off of me and proceeds to take over tanking.  I'm fine with this, as I can focus on just hitting the hell out of the boss and not really worry about positioning and the like.    


At phase transition the other tank says, ""Next time don't pull before the timer""  So now I'm a little miffed because there wasn't a timer until after pull and this is normal mode.  It's not that serious where you need to start slinging your srsbsns e-peen around.  So I say, ""Chill.""  To which I am met with  ""Lmao. Okay, kid.""  


I responded and it was met with more goading and we finished the run and before quick exiting he says ""Must be so great to suck at paladin. LUL""   


I don't get it.  I don't understand the mentality that you have to have to be a complete prick.  Especially on a run that was otherwise perfect.  I'll take partial fault for responding, but christ.

1. all participants must make/use a new character, any race/class with the exception of arcanist and marauder; just needs to be level 1 with nothing else

2. meet a race attendant as soon as you are able at either the ul'dah or gridania main aetheryte

3. once race begins, participants will make their way to mor dhona

4. they will receive a relay item that they must hold onto

5. for next leg of race, make way to opposite aetheryte - if you started in gridania, head to ul'dah and vice versa

6. hand in relay item to attendant. there will be a prize for first, second and third on both sides, and possibly consolation prizes for other participants.

7. give attendant your character name/server for who you want your prize to be given to and you will have 1 hour to claim it on that character.

Not sure if this matters, but I'm on Malboro in the Crystal data center.",7,1584473227,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fkbd86/green_leaf_race_event_idea_feedback_welcome/,ffxiv,1

fk8n9n,Son_of_Ssapo,(ShB spoilers) The video game crossover you didn't know you wanted! (Stellaris) [Meta],"For those of you who don't know, Stellaris is a Space 4x strategy game from Paradox where you can custom build empires and alien races with certain attributes and government civics. This is an empire I made back when I finished ShB, but it wasn't ever going to be complete until the DLC that just dropped today! The DLC adds Origins, a mechanic where you can select one of several pre-game scenarios, like starting on a half-broken Ringworld or as the vassal of a decadent, yet overwhelmingly powerful ancient empire, etc. The one to make this crossover complete is Doomsday, giving you limited time to vacate the planet before it inevitably explodes.

https://preview.redd.it/py0j4kbob9n41.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25021b20f584c24e9a8fb2ff234e6d338df23f3e

All assets are vanilla/unmodded, so I had to sorta twist the in-game logic to make things fit mechanically. For example: Spiritualist/Theocracy is mainly a gameplay path to unlocking Psionics and the end-games Shroud mechanics rather than any specific religious idea (the Shroud being a metaphysical dimension you interact with late in the game to gain boons and flirt with. . . dangers). Empire traits work on an axis which then determines which government type and civics you can get E.G. Fanatic Egalitarians cannot have Oligarchic government types and must use pure Democracy which the Ascians were not. Efficient Bureaucracy lets you have slightly more infrastructure while Shadow Council makes it far easier to micro the government. Species attributes are also required to be balanced so you can't just make the perfect life form from the get go (that's what gene modding is for ;) ) so I went with reduced population growth speed and reduced habitability on other worlds in order to get greatly increased lifespans and research bonuses.

My general lore idea behind this is a ""what if the Ascians chose not to make their sacrifices"" but it is pure fan-fiction, of course.

If you have the game or might want it and like this empire idea, my game is fully current on DLC but to make this you should only need the Federations expansion for the Doomsday origin and the Lithoid species pack for the Crystalline shipset.",6,1584464130,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fk8n9n/shb_spoilers_the_video_game_crossover_you_didnt/,ffxiv,1

I play a Paladin, and usually my queues are pretty good, but for certain things it takes forever to the point I can't actually do them anymore.

Extreme Garuda took about 2 hours to queue for, and I was lucky I even got it since I was laying in bed and had forgot that I kept my game running.
I still haven't been able to do Extreme Titan yet for one of my blue quests because the queues seem to be endless. Additionally the Raids mentioned in the title seem to be even worse. I've looked on a couple other threads about it, and it seems that it's because synced is too difficult to try and do?

fk6gn8,durrburger93,The worst story pacing I've seen in my life,"I know this has been said hundreds of times here already but I'm trudging through MSQ just now after getting the game recently and I can't believe how bad this is. It legitimately looks like it was made by people who've never played a game other than Final Fantasy in their life. 

I saw the Noclip documentary which basically did confirm that devs were completely ignorant of any improvements made in gaming in the past 15 years but I can't even fathom how bad 1.0 was when things are the way they are now.

I'm at the Titan arc now (30-40) quests and the plot is impossible to take seriously. Here we are dealing with a supposedly huge threat but let's run around for 20 quests assembling a stupid banquet so that adventurers who dealt with the threat previously consider us worthy enough to tell us how to beat it, the thing that also affects them and everyone else.

It's so abrupt every time they shift from important to meaningless garbage that you develop a radar for it. Every single dialog is written as inefficiently as possible, why say anything with a sentence that you can soliloquize about for 5 minutes. This seems to be a trademark of Japanese storytelling and I get the cultural differences but why doesn't localization appropriate the dialog instead of translating it word for word? 

I get why it was made like this in 2 years they had to save the game but WHY is it still like this 7 years later? I refuse to believe it's difficult from a technical perspective to just rip out 70% of MSQ filler and drastically improve the experience. Either that or just tie things like dungeons and everything else to levels instead of the story. 

I guarantee if this exact same situation was taking place in WoW the players would physically throw shit at Blizzard HQ for all the minute things they complain about. But here many players still defend this with the ""it's a story based game GTFO if you don't like the story"" zealous attitude that I guess SE doesn't consider it a big deal enough to fix...",69,1584456394,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fk6gn8/the_worst_story_pacing_ive_seen_in_my_life/,ffxiv,1

This game is so addicting for me. Reason I stayed also is because the community are nice. They are willing to help if they can. (Novice network I won't recommend it though for some reason so many mentors are entitled to themselves but it's a good way to get people for trials if you are short of people) I just started shadowbringers and Crystarium is so huge and beautiful.

I got other experiences I wanted to share also but wasn't able to screenshot them. But I'm sure everyone also had this experience just wanted to share mine. 

TL;DR I love this game

fk2rhc,Deariusibt,"New player here, just have a few questions.","To preface, I have experience in MMO’s, mostly Guild Wars 2.  I understand damage rotations, class roles, and general team tactics and composition.  I just have a few questions for some of the more basic elements of the game outside of dungeons and am also looking for some general advice on things that I might have unknowingly overlooked.


1. How important are ‘trash’ quests?  Should I be doing every quest in an area or are Fates/Hunting log the better way to level up my first character?  I just learned that blue quests unlock content and am wondering if any have prerequisite quests before they appear.  I also know to get class quests done ASAP.

2.  What is the best way to upgrade my gear as I level?  Should I invest time in crafting jobs or just buy it off the market?

3.  Somewhat related to the last question, is crafting my best route to some early game Gil until I progress further in the game?

4.  Are there any settings that I should change in the menu?  I know that a lot of that is subjective, but is there a certain setup that is more optimal or will improve my experience?

fk0u2a,RiddermarkLord,"Official Lyrics to Shadowbringers Crystarium theme #2, nighttime (Knowledge Never Sleeps) - directly from the vocalist, Amanda Achen.","[The vocal component of the Crystarium night theme ""Knowledge Never Sleeps"" has been inspiring to many listeners](https://youtu.be/nmGF2iif0mM?t=185) but the lyrics have never been officially released - or at least not where I could find it, and I searched everywhere.  The many educated guesses seemed close, but I wanted the ""official"" words....

I recently asked the vocalist Amanda Achen what the lyrics she sang were, and she was kind enough to reply.  Here it is, for the historical record:

***Stand tall my friend,***  
***may all of the dark lost inside you find light again,***  
***this time, tumbling, turning, we make amends,***  
***eternal winds from the land ascend***   
***here to lift us that we won’t end!***

As proof, Amanda posted these lyrics as a reply under one of the top comments in the YouTube video linked above, so this is straight from the vocalist's mouth....

If you want to hear this part of the song in game, go to Crystarium at night time (after completing the level 71 Main Story quest ""Warrior of Darkness""), and wait about 3 minutes.

(they're not sprouties btw). But still I'm usually chill and I don't mind wiping if the healer is willing to learn. I give them advice nicely but unfortunately most of those of whom I encounter have bad attitude. I mean, please tell me how can you have the courage to say "" I know how to heal. "" or ""I do my job you do yours."" after wiping 3 times in a row at first pull with me a PLD using all my CDs and spamming clemency?

fjyedj,Aurelius2625,"Stand in my damn star, and yes, you will be rescued.","For the uninitiated out there, Earthly Star is a 720 potency heal nuke that has the highest single hit potency of any heal, except healer LIMIT BREAKS. It's free. It's large. 

Had a Qitana Ravel where I, as an orange parsing, two time ultimate tank main (who knows the value of healer uptime, heals, and resource usage) had a neanderthal fuckboi he thought he was hot shit and wanted to ""learn me somethin'"". 

Idiot tank proceeds to IGNORE THE PREPLACED STAR at the END of the pull where there are no more mobs, and you literally can't go forward to the gated mob before killing them all. There's a space after where I placed the star, but it was clear there was no more to pull. 

Idiot tank proceeds to rage when I drag his dumb tank ass back to the star and has the AUDACITY to say, ""Place your star better"" ""you fucked me up"" ""the fuck are you doing?"".

Excuse me? The FUCK are YOU doing? You are literally a moron, full stop, if you don't stand in it. If it's placed in the wall, then forgo it. But if it's in the MIDDLE of the room where it's easy as fuck to stand in...stand in the star. 

I asked to be kicked, or to kick the tank. The simp DPS kicked me, which is fine, I got another instaque, but not before reporting his ass for how he raged at me. 

The communication beforehand at the start of the dungeon: ""Please stand in my star, it heals a lot"". 

Literally, that's all I fucking said. 

What I got in response? ""Selfish healer"". LOL WHAT THE FUCK? You press THREE BUTTONS on tank. What the hell did I ""mess up?"" (His dps was ass anyways, so I don't know what the hell his problem was, he certainly wasn't doing any damage to speak of). 

The lesson: no, your healer isn't probably ""Just a healer who doesn't know how hard it is to be a dps/tank uwuuu"". Get in my damn star or be rescued. If you get pissy with me, one of us is leaving, and I have no problem who it ends up being.",12,1584416192,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fjyedj/stand_in_my_damn_star_and_yes_you_will_be_rescued/,ffxiv,1
fjydi9,Sines314,So many useless spells!,"So, learning to play Black Mage, and I've noticed something kind of odd.

They have FIVE useless (or near useless) spells, at least at max level. And I thought Summoners Physic was a bit odd. Let's go over them, shall we?

Sleep. A relic of an earlier time. Maybe there's a Thaumaturge or Black Mage job that requires you cast it, so it stays around because of that. And I do hear it's useful in Eureka, and any future Eureka-like content too, I suppose. Makes a bit of sense, especially since the other two caster DPS get a healer unique ability in Raise, that Black Mage would get Sleep. Heck of a lot more niche though.

Scathe. I guess this isn't completely useless. If you need to move for a full GCD, and you have no instant-cast procs available, AND you don't have Sharpcast up (or if it'll expire in the next 4 seconds), then it's a DPS gain over doing nothing. But honestly, the odds that you'll notice that situation and actually make use of it are outweighed by the chances of just fat-fingering the spell. So off my bar it went.

Blizzard 2. Okay, what the hell is this? Freeze is this spell but better in every way except for MP cost (and the MP cost of Ice spells doesn't really matter anyway) and cast time (but it's not so low to give you a clip-free oGCD). Honestly, Freeze could just be renamed Blizzard two and exist as a trait upgrade and nothing of value would be lost.

Blizzard 1. Useful as a filler spell if the ticks don't line up your way in Umbral Ice, and neither Thunder or Foul/Xenoglossy is available. That's pretty darn niche, though I guess it'd come in handy the higher and higher your spell speed gets, such that the mana ticks not being in your favor makes a filler cast more and more necessary. Not as niche as Scathe, but still pretty niche.

Fire 2. This spell actually gets a lot of time in the sun. I believe before you get Enhanced Freeze / Umbral Hearts, your AoE rotation involved only finishing with Flare, rather than just going straight for it, and Fire 2 occupies the meantime. But still, off it goes when that happens.

Now, none of these spells is truly useless. Mostly, they serve purposes in leveling up, which simply get heavily outdated as your kit progresses. And while B1 and Scathe have niche uses at max level, Fire 2 pretty much doesn't, as far as I can tell (maybe if some adds join in after you've burned up all your Umbral Hearts on Fire 4, and don't want to go straight to Flare?) but since it exists alongside Flare in a rotation at some levels, it can't simply be made into an upgrade. Blizzard 2 though just seems a relic of an older day, back when Fate Farming involved spamming it like it was going out of style, and everyone could use it. It really could just be flat up replaced by Freeze and nothing of value would be lost.

Anyway, just me rambling with some thoughts. Black Mage is in an odd position compared to most classes since it relies almost solely on GCDs, many of which serve in a more free-form non-rotation based mana manipulation system, which causes certain abilities to see less and less use as you level up. Other classes don't have the same problem, because their GCDs are all much fewer and serve either as part of a static rotation, or as an alternative to usual actions (I'm thinking Reprise and Ruin 2 here, which are basically just ""I really need to move right now and I've got no instant cast right now"").",23,1584416080,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fjydi9/so_many_useless_spells/,ffxiv,1

One of my favourite has been ‘The bond between brothers’ a level 63 quest from The ruby sea. I don’t know why, it’s simple and non essential, doesn’t unlock anything and has no real impact, but I love the dialogue with Mahiwa’s eldest son. After you act dismissive of him he recognises that maybe its that same behaviour his mother has been trying to teach him to stop having, and realises maybe it’s that behaviour that causes his brother to fight with him.

fjp8bm,damesane,Problem with Sq. Enix support/payment,"Hello everyone, first time posting here, so excuse me if this isn't the place for a ""support"" question.

My subscription ended recently and since I don't have an automated payment plan set up I decided to renew it a couple of days ago. Unfortunately, my payment was not accepted at first, but I thought it had something to do with that extra ""$1"" charge that doesn't really get charged so I added the extra money to my card and tried making a payment, but it didn't work. I found that pretty weird so I went to my bank account and it seems like the subscription tried to withhold some money that never went through or something like that, so I'm missing money that I never spent.

I tried to go to support with this, but I had to give them my name, email, dob AND security question (which I don't remember) and as it turns out, you need to know your security question in order to *change* your security question, so I'm pretty much unable to contact them. Has this happened to anyone else here? Will it eventually resolve itself (miscommunication between the bank and their system) or am I pretty much screwed?

Is there somewhere with a TLDR off tank guide for the various raid encounters? Obviously there's lots of vids, which i'll check out, but i'd love to have a quick ""here's what you do"" for fights that i could just chuck up on my other screen as a reminder before starting an encounter.

What I am curious about is how did they gain access to my information? I am studying cyber security so I know about the general don't enter information, click on suspicious e-mails, ect. This is the first time I've ever fallen victim to a hacker. My username for my Square Enix account is vastly different from any other username I've used. My password has been changed to be MUCH more secure than before. I have also changed my e-mail password associated with the account. (That e-mail did not see any login attempts) Brute force was not an option because of how my password was and FFXIV login attempt timeout.

I do have a theory though, and it may be incorrect. I was experiencing an error receiving the digital certificate that the FFXIV launcher receives (Error code: -2146697211). I entered my information quite a few times to, what I assume, was an insecure connection to FFXIV. Is it possible someone could have been monitoring traffic to Lodestone for unencrypted information?

dungeon literally feels like it is 10 minutes long with a decent tank, freest levels i ever got in FFXIV. i don't understand the hate for this dungeon lmao the exp awarded from this dungeon is so nice

like even back in the day during 2.0... u could slave away at fates for 40min - 1hr for a single level.

fje1xr,gallotoro,Today I had the best experience I've had in years in an MMO,"Okay, so be me, a guy with a Trial Account. I'm currently taking my time and doing the MSQ on my pace. In some places I've encountered some mobs that overlevel the current level of that zones. So I was going on my way to do one of my MSQ and I find a big mob in the area. I click on him to see which level is and its a level 50 mob. I'm level 22 Archer, so let's try to don't go near him. I had a keybind to the F key to ""Confirm"" when talking to NPC's and make the talks faster so in an accident I press that key while I had that mob targetted. I shot at him and he runs after me to kill me in one hit.
This was the first time I died in this game and had no idea what happens if I die. So, okay, I had to come back to New Gridania and then go back to that place which was far... Things didn't seem well.

One player that was passing around while that mob killed me stopped by and he told me: ""hey, are you okay?"". He was a Pugilist and tried to help me and find a way to revive me, but he didn't had any healer class to do so.

And then, magic happened.

I was there, dead, wondering how should I come back and this player starts talking to me, about which are my current class I'm leveling, and if I'm closed in my house due to COVID-19. And we started talking, and talking, and talking. We talked about anime, about videogames, about animals, about the situation with the COVID-19, about gobernments, about how this MMO brought us the opportunity to met and I was really joyful while talking with him.

This was the first time in years that I've had the opportunity to met another player which I had nothing in common in that context while playing an MMO.

We continued talking, me there dead and he sitting at my side.
Talking about our lives, what we study (and surprisingly we are studying the same lol), what we like and how we want to play this game till the end and go to experience that together.
This conversation lasted more than an hour.
Another player joined us suddenly and asked one of their guildmates to come and resurrect me, and then we have taken a photo together:

https://imgur.com/gallery/dUsidG0

We shared Discords since we cannot add together as are both Free Trial players but as soon as we reach level 35 both concluded that we'll buy the game.

I will never forget this experience. Thanks to the SE team that devoted to create this amazing game. I'll definitely stick with FF XIV for a long time and I hope it to be one of my favourite games and my favourite MMO since WoW.",105,1584328168,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fje1xr/today_i_had_the_best_experience_ive_had_in_years/,ffxiv,1

fj7osl,Derfas13,To Soken about new boss music,"&gt;&gt;The music for certain instanced dungeon boss battles introduced in patches 5.0 and 5.1 has been adjusted.

I find this decision horribly wrong...
Not only this remix is Bad... I guess like all Dissidia NT music (is it cursed?).
But now it also completely ruins experience of hearing normal version first time at 3rd boss of Holminster Switch...

I just did The Grand Cosmos and 1st and 2nd bosses were so wrong with this music...
And i checked Holminster Switch after it just to confirm my disappointment...

It's ok to have it in Anamnesis Anyder and next new dungeons in future, but please, please revert this change for old 5.0-5.1 dungeons.

fj6m9r,zerasu,Housing Question / Relocation,"So, I have a medium FC house (on Balmung) that my best friend and I were the only ones who actually contributed in. Now, the FC is completely deserted, and I have mild regrets about getting a FC house instead of a shared Personal one, because we can't really leave the FC for a more active one without losing our house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, we all know there aren't any available houses on Balmung, least of all Mediums. Being that relocating is the only sure way to get a house-- which would leave us with the same predicament-- it seems we're pretty much screwed.

&amp;#x200B;

In that optic, what could be our best option? At first, I thought I could somehow find someone to do a trade, where they could relocate to my spot and I could purchase theirs, but I do believe that would leave me with an invisible timer and a very high chance of losing the spot to someone else. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there ANY way at all that we could fix this? Or are we completely shit out of luck and forced to stay alone in the FC for the foreseeable future?",8,1584299389,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fj6m9r/housing_question_relocation/,ffxiv,1

Since we're having a small thing at the local registry office, we've been told we need songs for: 

 ♫ Prior to the ceremony as guests arrive (might be able to play more than one, up to 3) 

 ♫ Entrance (this one will not be played in its entirety)

fj1sws,KusanagiKay,Poll: Which raid design do you prefer?,"I made the exact same thread on the OF, but just thought it might be a cool idea to expand it to reddit.

I am curious, what people liked the most - just general design-wise. Because of this I've made a strawpoll:

https://www.strawpoll.me/19536507

Explanation of what I mean with each design style:

Coil of Bahamut Style:    
Raid Instances start with a medium-sized dungeon with several waves of adds (some with mechanics). Final boss of each tier starts at or right before the boss room. Boss room cahave any shape, sometimes very odd.

Alexander Style:    
Raid Instances start with a miniature-dungeon with only a few waves of trash-adds (no real mechanics). Final boss of each tier starts in the boss room. All savage instances start at the boss room. Boss room is always round or square.

Omega / Eden Style:     
All Raid Instances consist of only a boss fight in a circular/square arena, both in normal &amp; savage.

Curious to hear your opinion.",27,1584281189,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fj1sws/poll_which_raid_design_do_you_prefer/,ffxiv,1

fj0w93,kewickviper,Road to 70 results: 70+ on all DoW/DoM and DoL/DoH after 45 days.,"This post is heavily inspired by: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/eubmuy/road_to_70_my_experience/ so before I start credit to dx96 as without his post I doubt I would have been inspired to do this. In light of this I'm going to structure my post in a similar way to his.

**The results:**

https://imgur.com/TpYnLU9

I was able to get all DoW/DoM and all DoH/DoL jobs to 70+ in exactly half the duration of the road to 70 buff (45 days). I also beat ShB and got my lvl 80 main a set of the 480 crafted gear as a present. To achieve this I did play a considerable amount, somewhere around 10 hours a day on average over the 45 days. You may have noticed that some jobs are actually over 70. This is because while levelling AST at 69 I decided to queue for an MS roulette and got praetorium. Because the buff was still active and the exp from that dungeon is insane I managed to skip over level 70 entirely. I tried this same strategy with pretty much every other job, however I got castrum something like 6 times in a row and so if it wasn't for poor RNG a lot of my jobs would be 71 instead.

**Main Scenario Progress:**

Originally I was expecting to get to Shadowbringers before doing anything else as that's usually what I do on mmos. However after realising the road to 70 buff only lasts 90 days I instead changed my goals to maximise the use of this buff. I would recommend focusing on the MSQ to at least Stormblood before attempting any of the other steps as it makes things much easier.

**A Realm Reborn**

I started the game in the typical mmo fashion of accepting every single quest I could find and completing them all to hand-in in bulk. Due to the buff however I quickly realised this was a bad idea when I was already level 20 before even getting to the level 10 MSQ. By the time I got to level 15 and could leave I was already over level 30 on my main and decided to pick up a few other side jobs to level as well. My original main was arcanist because I really liked the look of scholar and always like playing healers for fast queue times. This was a great decision once I hit 30 as I could do the quests as a summoner and then queue for dungeons as scholar for instant queues. To start with I was watching every cut scene and reading all the dialogue but at around 20-30 MSQ I started skipping and eventually by the end I was skipping virtually everything except major cut scenes. I finished ARR in about 30-35 hours and the post game stuff in another approximately 10-15 hours. For the post game stuff I skipped absolutely everything just to get through it and went back and watched them afterwards before starting heavensward. During ARR I was generally 7-10 levels above the MSQ at all times on my SMN/SCH and I also levelled a paladin up to around 35-40 and a ninja to 30. In general while running the MSQ you will be 5-10 levels ahead of the MSQ at any point right until the end of SB, thus it might be worth levelling a dps and a tank/healer at the same time here to get more bang for your buck. Ideally you want to quest mostly on dps because they're harder to queue for and queue for the MSQ duties on tank/healer because otherwise you waste time in long queues.

**Heavensward and Beyond**

From Heavensward on wards I did not skip any MSQ cut scenes and read every piece of dialogue available. This made the content significantly more enjoyable but meant it took me around a week to beat HW. In between beating the main portion of HW and the post game quest lines I picked up all the jobs and levelled them all to 30. Once arriving in Stormblood I took an extended break and spent most of my time getting every single job to 50+ and spending a little time on crafters with ishgardian restoration. Once that was completed I continued on with the story however I found that during HW and now in SB playing as SCH/SMN was ruining the cut scenes for me. The armour on this job always looks awful in my opinion and whenever there's a battle you just get a book out which looks stupid and ruins any cut scene you're in. Because of this and because it fit with the theme of SB I switched mains to Ninja while also levelling paladin as well to have instant queues for MSQ duties. Once beating SB I took another little break and levelled a couple of other jobs to 70 while doing the post game very slowly. At this point I picked up Red Mage and decided I wanted to make this my main in Shadowbringers. Since there's the trust system I wasn't reliant on levelling a tank/healer for instant queues so it was perfect. By virtue of just switching mains and playing around I already had SMN/SCH, NIN, PLD and RDM at level 70 before starting Shadowbringers.

**Squadrons:**

As you'll see in my levelling method I made heavy use of squadrons. Outside of running premade dungeons with good teammates I believe squadrons is the fastest method to level when you have the road to 70 buff. The reason is because for things like quests, leaves, fates and logs it acts like a 100% buff however for kills it also doubles all your other buffs so you can get over +500% xp bonus with all the other buffs and rested xp. Since dungeons are already a very fast method of levelling this just makes them insane and heavily weights them against all other forms of levelling.
	
Because I knew pretty early on I was going to be using squadrons a lot I unlocked them as soon as I possibly could. As soon as grand companies became available I started working on collecting seals and completing the hunt logs to rank up until I hit 2nd lieutenant and could unlock my squadron. I then used: http://ffxivsquadron.com/ to keep track of my squadron and to solve the squadron missions so I could always do the highest level one to level up the fastest. Luckily for me my challenge log popped shortly after unlocking so I could get a few new recruits and start running squadron dungeons right away.
	
**Roulettes and Beast Tribe Quests:**

Although the vast majority of my levelling was through squadrons I don't want to underestimate how good daily roulette's and beast tribe quests are for levelling. They are probably the largest xp/hr things you can do in the game. I would highly recommend looking up how to unlock all the roulette's and the beast tribes and get into a habit of spending a few hours every day doing them. Without doing this every day it would have taken me significantly longer.

**Levelling Method:**

The method I used to level was very similar to dx96's with some slight alterations:

* 1-18: (~1 hour) Start by doing your job quests and also the first two pages of your hunting log. I would kill anything with the hunting log symbol while doing the quests then look up on the wiki if there are any in the area nearby. If you have a high level friend another thing you can do is go to a high level zone with them and tag mobs while they 1 shot them. 1-20 takes around 30 minutes then.
* 18-20: (~15-60 mins) This is the first of the awkward levelling spots. If you're a tank/healer it's worth doing a quick level roulette or dungeon or ask your fc to help. Otherwise I would do either leaves or fates to bridge the gap.
* 20-50: (3-4 hours) Do your lvl 20 job quest then start running squadron with Halatali then doing each of the following until the next unlocks: Toto-Rak -&gt; Brayflox's Longstop -&gt; Stone Vigil -&gt; Aurum Vale. At 30 you're going to want to do job quests and upgrade your job. Gear up with drops from the dungeon but its not that important since your squadron will be doing most of the work anyway. This can be quite slow at the beginning but once your squadron are levelled up and you have the level 5 abilities it goes much faster. Drzemel hold and the level 50 dungeons are not worth doing in my opinion.
* 50-53: (1-2 hours) This is the second awkward levelling spot. Catch up with job quests then again do either roulettes, dungeons, HW beast tribe or fates. A daily run in the praetorim will basically get you to 53 in 45 mins. If you run out of options running Aurum Vale here until 53 is not actually that bad and probably preferable to the other options.
* 53-61: (3-5 hours) This is the most grindy section, you're going to want to do squadron runs of only Sohm Al. You unlock the vault at 57 but you get at least 5 mil an hour doing Sohm Al which is more than you get with the vault and has much less chance of you wiping due to dumb squadron ai. As always make sure you're running daily roulette's and beast tribe during this section to make it go faster.
* 61-70: (4-6 hours) You want to run the highest SB dungeon available. Generally each run will get you 50-75% of a level. 3 Runs of each should comfortably get you to 70. 

Squadron members I used were mostly: Conjurer, Maurauder, Arcanist and Archer with Archer being replaced by dps job and all on offensive level 5 spec except tank on defensive. Generally because the AI's stats are broken the fastest runs are playing as either healer or tank. When playing as tank be a little conservative with your pulls as the healer ai seems to only start casting once you're below 50% and if they're casting something else they won't cancel to save you. The ai doesn't really use aoe skills so there isn't much point in doing large pulls anyway. As healer it's pretty much a cakewalk as everyone has huge hp pools and you tank is way over geared.

You may notice that I don't make any mention of palace of the dead. I really did not like it and had some really bad experiences with groups wiping at floors 30 and 40 which made me give up. If you wipe in PotD then you lose all the xp and it is a complete waste of time. For me the risk that I might get a bad group was too great and the xp from farming 1-10 was too low that I stopping doing it after about 4-5 times. I assume the xp is much better when you're farming 51-60 but I didn't have the patience to get there and with the buff don't being as effective here I didn't see much point. Given this I haven't unlocked the SB deep dungeon heaven on high and can't comment on that.

**Gearing**

* For 1-50 I stuck almost exclusively to dungeon gearing. I kept most of the pieces around until every job had passed that point then I turned them into GC seals. By the time I got to my last few jobs they already were fully geared out for the dungeon before even starting it.
* At 50 I generally got ironworks for most jobs and supplemented here and there with HW crafted gear and rewards from MSQ. I got at least the ironworks weapon on every job.
* From 50-60 I just used gear from Sohm Al and from the half dozen or so vault runs I did before abandoning it in favour of Sohm Al.
* At 60 on my paladin, ninja and scholar I got the shire set and this was good enough until 70.
* From 60-70 I used a combination of the gear from dungeons, rewards from MSQ and crafted/vendor gear.
* At 70 I got the scaevan gear for every single class. Given I was running most of the roulette's every single day for 45 days I easily had enough poetics to fund this.

**Crafter and Gatherer Jobs:**

For crafting and gathering I levelled them in a pretty similar fashion to dx96 however again with some slight differences. I also relied heavily on GC turn ins, especially starred ones however at a certain point I realised I was spending 2-300k gil a day just doing all of these or I would waste 3-4 hours gathering and crafting if I wanted to make them myself so I changed my strategy. I made heavy use of https://ffxivcrafting.com/ to look up materials for recipes. Note for most of these I never bothered doing the job quests past 20. One of the first things I will do before getting them to 80 is lookup all the items for all job quests and hand them all in, in bulk.

**DoH:**

* 1-22: (~1 hour) I just did a combination of the job quests and crafted one of every item from 1-20 on my crafting list. For the majority of these the materials can just be bought from NPCs or for very cheap from the MB. This generally got me somewhere around 22-24
* 22-40: (~30 mins) For this I did a couple of GC turns ins but did it mostly through ishgardian restoration turn ins. I figured out roughly how many materials I would need then went out and gathered them or bought off MB if cheap enough which only took maybe 1-2 hours, then used a macro to craft all the materials on each job which took maybe an hour.
* 40-70: (~10-30 mins a day) If the GC turn in was starred or the HQ version was cheap on the MB I would buy that on a daily basis. Each day would catch up lowest job with beast tribe. Spent an hour or two over a few days doing ishgardian restoration to catch up the rest to 70.

**DoL:**

* 1-39: (~2-3 hours) For Mining and Botany I just did the job quests until around lvl 40ish. I found that just by spending my time gathering the materials for the job I would get enough xp to accept the next job. This got me to around 38/39 I believe so I stopped after that.
* 39-70: (1-5 mins a day) I did this almost exclusively with HQ GC hand ins. With only a bit of searching it was very easy to find cheap prices on the MB for these hand ins.


**Bonus Blue Mage Section:**

As you can see I also got blue mage to level 60. I don't however mention this at all in the section above and that's because I did 1-60 in around 45 minutes total. To do this you use the same method I talk about in the 1-18 levelling section above. You tag high level mobs then get a high level friend to 1 shot them. For blue mage you get around 200-300k a mob depending on the chain bonus and it goes very quickly. I spent maybe 2-3 hours one day getting BLU skills as well.

**Conclusion**

So that's my experience with the road to 70 buff. I would say that it's definitely possible if you play somewhere in the region of 5 hours a day for the 90 days. It's probably possible with even less play just you have to be a little more efficient with your time than I was. The buff is absolutely outstanding for levelling alts and when you get to 70+ and start running ShB content you really feel how much of a difference it makes.",11,1584276832,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fj0w93/road_to_70_results_70_on_all_dowdom_and_doldoh/,ffxiv,1

fiztw7,Aethlin,Some additional questions on starting High-end content as healer,"Hi, I returned to FFXIV around the start of Shadowbringers, after leaving the game due to reasons around 2.1, and, while I've toyed some with the idea before, I'm now back to the point where I'm really looking into doing the newest extremes/savage raids. I could use some help and advice on the following things, though, cause what I've found so far on these topics is from around Stormblood, seems to contradict between sources, or is just generally vague.   
As the title suggests, I main healer (about evenly divided between sch and whm).

\- What would you recommend starting with? Cinder drift ex or eden's verse savage? Or should I start with the eden's gate savages and/or the 5.0/5.1 ex trials and move up from there?   
I've tried the latter, but I have trouble finding groups, either I end up with a group full of people who haven't cleared yet and we make it to enrage at best, or I can't even join because I haven't cleared yet. The gear I can get from the former high-end (5.0/5.1) content is either worse, mostly the same or very close to what I already have (eg, the eden's gate savage weapon being 475, rather than the 470 one I have.)  
Just to throw it out as a point of reference, my healer ilvl is 473 atm, and I can kill the dummies with at least a few seconds to spare for cinder ex, fulmination savage and furor savage, and I get to \~4% on iconoclasm savage. (Not sure how much that says for healer, though XD)

\- When it comes to melding, would you recommend I wait and see how it goes first, meld just the (currently) highest ilvl gear or meld as much as I can as soon as I can?

Any other advice for going into the high-end content (as a healer) would be appreciated, though chances are I've already found it while searching myself.

Even when Lahabrea was spouting his boring exposition at the end, he was screaming his battlecry nonsense mid cutscene while also trying to deliver a speech until the last 30 seconds of the cutscene when the victory music played. I don't think I've ever seen a more confused party. Did these two players just force skip them with sheer willpower of unskippable cutscene hatred or something?

fipmdt,Tristen895,Found a bug in data backup and a fix,"IDK if it was just me but this morning I decided to switch PS4's to play in my living room instead of my bedroom so I used the character/client data backup to transfer my settings. Well the game downloads backup files that overwrite the regular setting files the thing is the backup files arnt temporary and the game was loading both backup and regular data files cause my game and system to have a huge delay on everything actions, menus, share/home button, loading icons, everything! 

I deleted the backup files and the game now works fine, I honestly have been trying to figure out why my game was doing this all morning and can't believe that was the problem. I had restarted my ps4, and deleted save data and the game to do a fresh install.... But it was just a bug with backing up setting, might also be with mentioning I transferred data between a old gen PS4 and a slim PS4 but this is the first time I've encountered this problem twice in one day after a fresh install!!!",2,1584220285,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fipmdt/found_a_bug_in_data_backup_and_a_fix/,ffxiv,1

fil8ij,ShadesGuide,(SG) COMPLETE (Video) GUIDE to Settings - System Configuration Menu," It’s been almost exactly two months (again) since [my last major update](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/elx3ub/sg_v30_complete_guide_to_crafter_leveling_leves/). This is a big one for me again—I’ve been extremely busy.

&amp;#x200B;

# What the hell is “Shade’s Guide”?

[This is the sort of guide I’ve been known for in the past](https://preview.redd.it/7hhev65p0om41.png?width=2540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee7d526dea5503c646c7f9ab067dceb615d7e8ad)

***Until today***… this is the only guide I’d published: a spreadsheet-based **complete crafter leveling guide** **(all jobs Lv 1-80)** that I host on [my website](https://www.shadesguide.com/). It fully covers leveling up via crafting leves and Ishgardian Restoration collectables and shows you exactly how and where to get every single item necessary. It’s been extremely well-received so far, and I’ve been very happy to see that it’s helped out so many people.

*(Side-note: I’ll be updating the Ishgardian Restoration data very soon. Apparently, some exp. values changed in 5.2)*

&amp;#x200B;

# “Until today”

[So symmetrical...!](https://preview.redd.it/ft6ez7hx0om41.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f41b76307e476de320b2addaebfb4f1eb721b6f1)

A few minutes ago, I published my first Youtube video guide for FFXIV. It covers **the entire System Configuration menu** (the one with all the sound and graphics settings) at the same crazy level of detail as my crafter leveling guide. It’s also **very heavy on visuals** and was written/designed to be as **beginner-friendly as possible**!

&amp;#x200B;

**Here’s a link to the video:** [https://youtu.be/9mDkGbcoti8](https://youtu.be/9mDkGbcoti8)

&amp;#x200B;

If you’ve ever wondered about any of the settings in this menu or if you know of any **new players** who might be confused by some of the stuff in there (like… **Parallax** **Occlusion**!), please feel free to check out this video and let me know if you have any questions at all.

&amp;#x200B;

# The new Youtube channel

I’ll be uploading a new video to [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusWnSa2CfgUnEPkLdWiMow) **every Saturday at 9AM PST**.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I’ll also cover the **Character Configuration** and **HUD** **layout** menus and then jam them all into a “Complete FFXIV Settings” playlist. The next few videos I upload to this channel will be much shorter than this one, though—making a video this long and detailed every week would **literally** kill me:

[36-minute video made with over 70 tiny clips](https://preview.redd.it/og17t1c11om41.png?width=2557&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de0176a5fc61e249077bcb2dd1993a3a7a5b08f)

I’ll still be updating my website and adding onto it over time, but most of the new guides I make will be going on the Youtube channel.

&amp;#x200B;

# The other new Youtube channel

I’m also making a **second** new channel strictly for Let’s Play videos.

And here’s the first Let’s Play I’m starting:

[I heard some people in this subreddit might like this game](https://preview.redd.it/quj9ta6v0om41.jpg?width=2560&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dff32e0573f8a371fc466467a5788c8d03915a00)

I’m playing through from start to finish on a brand-new alt. Unlike my guide videos, these will all be recorded with live, unscripted commentary.

New uploads to [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIIO-6OR3xWipDdE28IWHVw) will come **every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 9AM PST.**

I've already recorded 2 1/2 hours of the LP, and the first video will be going up on **Monday 3/16**.

(These videos require about 10,000% less work to produce, so I can pump them out much faster. Plus, it’ll give me plenty of B-roll footage for guide videos.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hell of a lot I want to accomplish with all of this stuff, and getting things going on Youtube is the next major step for me. (#goalz)

**Thank you guys for all the support and feedback you’ve given me over the years. &lt;3**

As always, if you have any questions, comments, or whatever about anything, let me know!

fif1ln,PM_ME_YOUR_BOOK_IDEA,Something really needs to be done about the housing system,"Been trying to get a house for a long time now, but these past two days really take the cake.

My bf and I are on the Gilgamesh server which has numerous issues right off the bat, like the Goblet having a whole ward to one clan, and the Mists having half a ward to one clan too.

But there are just fundamental issues with the buying and relocating system as a whole. It is insane that people can be at a plot for 8+ hours (especially for those of us on ps4 who can't macro) to attempt to buy their first house and someone who already has a house can just come up whenever and take it out from under you.

My bf was at a plot for 10 hours, and we saw someone we had seen before come up and relocate. Where had we seen them before? At a house a few days ago where he had relocated then, too. Why can he relocate multiple times so quickly and reset timers so often? 

Not to be defeated, my bf tries a plot in Limsa and I wait at the relocator's old plot for 8 hours. A neighbor literally two houses down relocated to the plot I was at and his friend taunted everyone that was waiting there for being ""too slow"" to buy the plot like we had a choice.

I head to another plot that just became available in the goblet and I see a clan of lala's waiting there. They get the house about an hour later, which was fine. I was just happy to see that there wasn't a relocation involved. Except, the plot is quickly vacated because they immediately relocated to the plot in Limsa my bf was waiting at.

Why is this allowed at all?

***Proposed solutions:***

1. Instant relocations should only be available in the first two hours to minimize wasting everyone else's time. After that two hour window, relocation can still happen, but they have to wait until the house is available for purchase for everyone else.

2. Relocations should not be available until one week of owning a house has passed. Likewise, each subsequent relocations must be at least a week apart as well.

3. When a house becomes available, for 24 hours, anyone can apply for ownership. When the 24 hours is up, the plot will be given to a random person on the application list.

4. Players can only apply to one plot at a time. If they don't claim it in 24 hours, the plot goes back up for sale.

This would let players have an actual fair rng chance and let them eat, use the restroom or do anything else but press buttons for hours upon hours! I'm not jaded or anything, lol.",21,1584172729,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fif1ln/something_really_needs_to_be_done_about_the/,ffxiv,1

FFXIV was the most recommend one but I always had that idea the FF is weeb game so no thank you I'm not gonna play it but as someone very desperate as me want something good to play I said what the heck let's give it a try.

And I just ignored all the part of the game that I didn't like. Like the weird names and some of the races looking and start play. And it was great fun I actually had fun doing quests. 

I didn't like that most of the cutscene don't have voice over. I hope that change in the high lvls. Please confirm if that true.

I start doing quests and since I am a completions guy who want to do every thing the game can offer  I start to do every quest I can find and still have fun.

I also wonder right now I have no idea what the story is talking about I am at lvl 20 and I did part of the MSQ but still have no idea.

fi780f,Made4542,Final Fantasy XIV's Top 5 Flaws,"I made a post of this on gamefaq's XIV board in a topic about the game's flaws and I feel this should be said. Those that are easily offended by this post...sorry but well it's on you if you choose to read it. That said, I love FFXIV and this is in no way saying this game is terrible but it has some very obvious and some serious flaws  that need to addressed. You've been warned. Enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

There's alot of flaws in this game has but I'll list the top 5.

\#1. Housing System(shouldn't have your home you spent a ton of gil on be auto-dem'd cause you don't log in enough. The limited housing issue can be fixed if SE and Yoshi-P get off their a\*\*\*\* and overhaul it. Using housing as a means to trap players into a never ending subscription is weak and greedy exploition of a already flawed system).

 \#2. Gear Progression(The gear progression in XIV sucks a\*\*. It's basically using a single player FF based gear system for a MMO based FF game. Single player progression systems ruin the longterm use of gear in a MMO. I mean yeah you can use old gear as glamour, but that's the only use it has, and the relics are also part of this problem. FFXI's gear system is what a MMO gear system was supposed to be. Gear should have longterm use. Sure, make new gear, of course, but old gear should still be useful even if it's situational).

FFXI gear, wither it's weapons or armor had bonuses on them that helped specific things about the job, like giving BLM gear a Magic ATK Bonus+ or a Elemental Magic+ bonus or giving Healer gear a Cure Potency+ bonus. But XIV gear is so basic it's shameful for a MMO. If SE wanted this to be a single player FF then they got what they wanted, but paying monthly for a MMO using a single player system is asinsine and a waste of cash imo.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3. The Overworld Sucks(If I wanted to walk inside of a painting, I'd travel through FFXIV's overworld. Seriously, the graphics for some of the areas is beautiful but the overworld has no real threats, no challenging overworld monsters, no interconnecting caverns(FFXI had alot of interconnecting caverns like Gusgen Mines, Gustav Tunnel, etc), and honestly it feels artificial. Eoreza is beautiful...but that's all it is. The challenge, the actual thrill of travelling the overworld is nonexistent and for a modern FF game, let alone SE's second FF MMO to follow FFXI's successes, it's a shame).

&amp;#x200B;

\#4. Where's the Dungeons?(Seriously...where are they? I'm not talking about DF dungeons I'm talking about ACTUALLY dungeons. The DF ""Dungeons"" are so bland they put me to sleep, like walking in a museum. Dungeons are supposed to dank, dark and interesting to explore places. For FFXI players...remember that dungeon underneath San D'oria's Castle? The one with the leeches? The monsters were challenging, exploring the dungeon was fun and it was a fun place to level and explore).

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I go to Central Thanalan and happen to pass by the entrance to Cutter's Cry...I feel sad as f\*\*\* that I can't just walk in and zone into Cutter's Cry from the outside, instead I get c\*\*kblocked and forced to select it from a DF menu to access it....\*sigh\*

&amp;#x200B;

\#5. Isolationism is REAL(This game is a loner in of itself. The players as well. Where as FFXI forced you to group with people(I mean hello it's a MMO...DUH) to get stuff done and make friends, FFXIV is the polar opposite. While it does force grouping to an extent, the majority of things are done solo, as if playing a single player game. Back in FFXI, if you were a frequent face on your server and always did events with people, they'd eventually come to know you more and friendships were forged.If you screwed up alot or you became a issue for alot of people...like leeching off their parties for example, you were exiled or not invited to stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

FFXI had a real neighborly aspect to it and if it was a small server, eventually everyone would know your name. And in order escape the people you offended, you mostly were resigned to move to another server.

&amp;#x200B;

DF dungeons, raids, roulettes in XIV(especially if solo) force you to group with random people, but after your done whatever it is your doing...you never really see them again).

&amp;#x200B;

Yes adding friends from other servers and World Visit exists now, but before that and even now the game feels like a ghost town most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

fi4bqf,FederalSheepherder,Want your server's Stockpile to fill up faster? I have a plan for that!,"Not all that interested in scripts or the leader board rankings? Just wanna help out? Hate the idea of expert crafts? Just want your server's Stockpile to hurry the F\*CK up? Dont worry! I have a plan for that! 

&amp;#x200B;

And its just \*\*Two Steps!\*\* That's right! \*\*Two Steps!\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Using the lvl 80 crafting macro to craft the regular lvl 80 items takes about 3 minutes to craft a total of 5 items. Each netting you 125 points toward the stockpile. Equally about 625 points every 3 minutes. Roughly 6,250 every 30 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Using a simple Two Steps (Trained Eye &gt; Careful Synthesis) on literally any other level you can craft 7 items a minute, 21 every  3 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

\* Lvl 20 crafts nets you 48 per craft, 336 per minute, 1008 every 3 minutes, 10,080 every 30 minutes.

\* Lvl 60 crafts nets you 69 per craft, 483 per minute, 1449 every 3 minutes, 14,490 every 30 minutes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my math might not be 100% correct on this cus I might be a dumb hoe sometimes. But theoretically this is a much faster way to fill the bar and spawn the fates at not a complete \~\~gobshite\~\~ hour

fi1btl,Sylversakura,4th Ranged Physical Class: Beastmaster,"So, I'm relatively new to Reddit so go easy on me, but I just had an epiphany of what a new ranged type class could be.  Beastmaster.  Weapon type: whip.  It can vary from the others by having various pets to control, similar to summoner.  I don't know what all the specifics would be, but I feel like it would give an interesting ranged type.  Plus it always confused me that none of the ranged types had pets, but the casters did.  And yes, whips are canon in final fantasy lore.  And beastmasters did have the proficiency to use them as well.  I don't know, what do you people think?

fhwipa,bobbybouchey88,My 5.21 expert crafting rotation.. long steps but high success,"As the title says, this is what I got on paper for how I complete 5.21 expert Ishgard restoration turn ins. This is just what I do and have helped people struggling to even hit the turn in minimum. I hit cap almost every time, at the sacrifice of a higher step count. I don't care for negative critiques, but please feel free to comment with anything helpful, if I've missed anything, have any questions, or if this helped you. It's guaranteed to work if you follow the guide closely. Don't deviate on anything until you've got it down for sure. 

I use specialist (easily worth it to switch to build rank points for the week). Prior to food have 2492crafts/2502control/553 CP and use HQ Popotoes Au Gratin and HQ cunning craftsman syrup (not necessary). 

All eyes are on Status condition

MuMe opener (if at any point you get Pliant, stop to use Manip) &gt; Veneration &gt; (If Normal, use Inner quiet) If Sturdy or Centered Use Rapid Synth &gt; You only need 1 successful buffed Rapid Synth then move on to normal rotation for Quality (let the veneration buff die - THEN once you get a 'Centered' Proc, use an unbuffed Rapid Synth to get near cap - its important to go out of order for this to benefit from a Centered proc)

Now the rest of rotation for quality.. Inner quiet if you haven't already

Follow forever:

If It's Good &gt; Use Tricks of the Trade

If its Centered &gt; use Hasty Touch

If its Sturdy &gt; use Hasty Touch

If its Normal &gt; Use Observe

If its Pliant &gt; Use Manip

If you have Pliant while Manip is up &gt; Use Waste Not 2 (unless Manip has 1-2 turns left, it can usually be a gain to repop it) 

If you have Pliant while Manip and WN2 is up and you don't want to refresh them, Prepatory Touch becomes worth it

In the occasional event you have Manip and WN2 active, do not Observe Fish. WN2 makes Normal status OK to use hasty touch still, but again avoid WN2 per the rotation unless it comes up. It is only worth it to use WN2 if you got it cheap and with Manip already up. 

If youre down to 15 Dura and still no Pliant for Manip, then use full price Manip

Obviously don't kill the craft when you pop Manip at low durability and get a proc, you may have to Observe to get out of dead spot for more condition buffed hasty touches. 

Tricks of Trade gets priority casting even with Manip/WN 2 up as you've only paid 44/45 CP for them with Pliant and you dont use WN2 at all if no Pliant. So 20CP is 50% of their 8 turn cost.

Get to 45k quality with that, then need 74CP and at least 15 dura for finisher of Inno &gt; GS &gt; Byregots

There's fancier finishers for sure but this is the five fivehead way and I'm stickin to it.

Hope this helps. Good luck, have fun!",80,1584088841,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhwipa/my_521_expert_crafting_rotation_long_steps_but/,ffxiv,1

I've tried logging in multiple characters in game, Checked the lodestone (Oh Hey they like this website and stuck around) , tried incognito mode Cause I heard that could help, even tried another browser completely.  The only place they don't seem to exist....is mogstation. The ONLY place that I can buy the optional items that I want.   


Frustrated I go to the support center, Where after entering the problem, I'm told all about mogstation Items, that I can buy (but I can't cause I DON'T have any characters!) and offered help with my retainer services, and shown the full EULA agreement.....  NONE of which have ANYTHING to do with the one search term I put in... ""Characters missing""  


   Email sent, and resigned to suffer without my new dance I wanted, or my story skip.  when suddenly BRAIN STORM... I'll buy it as a gift code, cause I don't need characters to do that!!!

fhw1yb,Eper,[Discussion] Why is the FFXIV market so volatile?,"I've played many MMOs that have a player driven market similar to FFXIV. However, this is the only game I've played that seems to have major problems with market crashes and inconsistent item sales. In games like EVE, OSRS, and Escape from Tarkov, if a player puts up a stack of a material at -10% general market value, It will be bought up almost instantly.

However, In this game it seems like players doing that will consistently crash the market, and the items will now be worth less in general. Has anybody else noticed this? What factors could be contributing to this? What could be done to fix it?",29,1584085614,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhw1yb/discussion_why_is_the_ffxiv_market_so_volatile/,ffxiv,1

How do you wish it will be like? Coz frankly, I personally feel if it’s juz Ishgardian architecture, those big tall slabs of concrete with cathedral-like structures, it’ll be rather dull/boring.

My take (wish list if you will):

\- I think there’ll be a snowy weather for the district, not juz in Christmas season. But maybe there'll be permanent snow on the ground?

\- Floating plots? There’s a lot of floating island/rocks in HW. Will they make it to the housing? Will be cool though.

I live in a third world country and usually y get around 110-130 ping for most NA server based mmos I played before (in a pretty consistent way too). To my surprise I have found that my latency to the ffxiv servers is sometimes around 140 ms, sometimes around 150 ms and sometimes as far up as 250 ms. Thanks to the queue system ffxiv has this means that the game is still playable even at 250, but I find that when ping is low I can double weave oGCDS and when it is high I lose this ability without clipping my GCD (I tested while keeping the same SKS), which is pretty aggravating. Is it normal that ping varies so wildly in FFXIV or could I have an issue on my side?",5,1584065192,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhs6t2/question_about_ffxiv_and_ping/,ffxiv,1

But after reading I knew stuff like that Allagans are the ones who made the two moons and captured bahamut in one of them. What I still don't get is..

fhnykn,Jet_Sett_Run,How do I contact a living breathing GM.,"Just shy of three weeks ago I opened a ticket over accidentally purchasing the wrong item with Tomestones of Allegory. I opened a ticket requesting a refund or item exchange and was gotten back to almost immediately. I followed each of the steps provided to me and finished with discarding the item and was told to await a GM to contact me in game. Around one week ago a GM messaged me while I was, unfortunately, AFK. He messaged saying he would like to talk to me and then said since I was AFK I should simply contact a GM at my own convenience to continue forward with the process. Now it has come down to the past week of me opening tickets and a bot simply responding to them saying nothing of value and no way for me to contact a GM. I have opened a ticket on their support website and it said I would need to contact a GM in game, again an automated response. If I open a ticket in game it says to wait for the refund to be processed through the mog mail, once again the same automated response every time. I would be content to wait however I have specific instructions from a GM via in game messaging to contact a GM at my discretion to move the process forward. I am incredibly frustrated and have no idea how to move forward now. Any help is appreciated.

fhnewm,Leutgard-,Login/Client Issues,"I decided to reinstall XIV last night and noticed that while the client seemed to be working just fine, the patches were downloading at an unusually low speed (11 Mb/s instead of the usual 50 Mb/s+) for the entire process. I closed the client once it finished and waited until today to actually play it again, only to find the client almost entirely refuses to function at all. Before I attempted to fix anything, I would be greeted with three different types of error messages, [No.1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589566326360506379/687759596772786194/Screenshot_11.png), [No.2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589566326360506379/687759600396795962/Screenshot_12.png), &amp; [No.3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/589566326360506379/687759603047333999/Screenshot_10.png), the client taking 30 to 60 seconds on average to respond to an input, if at all. Before coming here, I decided to look for possible solutions on the support webpage and on Google and have done the following according to the information and instructions I've found:

&amp;#x200B;

* Fully uninstalling FFXIV, also deleting any files relating to it in My Documents such as .cfg files, and the remains Steam left behind.
* Rebooting both my PC and internet modem, and performing a DNS flush after.
* Using Steam to change my download region and repairing my Steam Library.
* Ensuring that Windows was up to date and that Internet Explorer was at least on version 11.
* Ensuring that active scripting was enabled under my internet options.
* Using ipconfig /release and /renew commands.

Having done this, booting XIV now only brings a dark grey screen, repeating error message No.1 before the client closes itself. What is the next course of action I should take?",14,1584046432,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhnewm/loginclient_issues/,ffxiv,1

And if you want to get more use identical cast and for more quality patience 2 is good.

fhiz54,Kiba_Azure,Is the content in Shadowbringers too short term and too short lived?,"After messing with the new Ishgard content the past few days as I'm sure many of you have; a question has been nagging at the back of my mind for months, is the brand new content in Shadowbringers designed to burn like a roman candle and whither away next expansion? It certainly feels that way, at least to me. This has nothing to do with the patch staples such as raids or trials, but the, mostly, brand new side content.

Let's go down the list, shall we?

&amp;#x200B;

**Fates** 

The region levels for fates was an interesting concept that has surprisingly been supported in each patch, but even with a handful of new items the number of players grinding fates after launch is fairly small and that number will drop to almost nothing after the expansion. This will be horrible for new players that desire those items in the future as they will have to primarily solo grind their way to these items. Even if they attach part of the relic grind to fates, I would not expect more than a small percentage of players to do this content post expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

**Blue Mage**

The buffs to the majority of their kit and the new spells breathed a bit of life into the poorly designed class and many players briefly jumped into grinding the spells out. That did not last long in the slightest and I hope anyone that wanted their Morbol mount acquired it because PFs for blue mage spells or full BLU parties are gone. I hope you have helpful friends or a blue mage discord if you wish to do this content now. With level-sync required for the Morbol this content will likely always be relatively challenging unless future spells break mechanics further. Will blue mage be updated in the future? Most likely, but the content is very flash  in the pan. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Onsal Hakair**

PVP in FF14 will never be particularly popular and this new map has been no different. There was a brief surge in frontline que times, but with no new items to acquire with wolf marks most players will not even attempt the roughly 300 matches it would take to acquire 100 wins for the mount. Outside of prime time the que times for frontline are already back to 30+ minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ocean Fishing**

This is fantastic leveling content with a few fairly heavy RNG based rewards locked behind it. This may be a decent source of yellow scrips going forward, but as more people get their shark mounts I would expect the number of people waiting at the dock to dwindle. It might be very difficult for new players to do high score runs in the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Ishgard Phase 1**

This content was already dead within a month of releasing and little more needs to be said on it. Thankfully for newcomers, the rewards are currently still available in phase 2.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ishgard Phase 2**

The newest content to be brought to the game has brought in a hefty dose of grind. It still has most of the same flaws as phase 1 for longevity, but the kupo of fortune RNG may keep players doing it slightly longer. The ranking titles will not be a good enough carrot for most people to sustain this long term and by its very nature it would seem this content will die in the future once the entire restoration has been completed. It is very likely they will retain some method of earning scrips for new players, but this content will absolutely not see veteran players returning to it post expansion.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this temporary content that SE seems to be pushing this expansion? Do you think it was worth the loss of something more permanent such another iteration of Palace of the Dead? Or maybe you wanted some other smaller scale content instead?",16,1584030299,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhiz54/is_the_content_in_shadowbringers_too_short_term/,ffxiv,1

fhiwrf,prok_chop,Shiva - E8S Light Rampart - BOPG Sharingan Bowtie,"Hey all, 

I've seen almost every group in PF strat doing Ilya strat. Although it's simple and avoids having to adjust chains into a bowtie formation, it's a sad sad existence when you get an orb tether as a melee. 

I wanted to share the **Light Rampart** strat my static have converted too which allows **very good if not full melee uptime** during the mechanic. The movement is pretty minimal too which benefits our casters + healers too. 

I would say its straight forward to pick up as long as you don't greed while learning the movement. 

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

The strat requires the '**chains'** role to form a bowtie. If everyone chained starts on their own tower, it should only require the tank + 1 dps to swap places if you don't already have the bowtie formation. 

We have our team start in the formation below and have the tank adjust with a dps if necessary.

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**Strategy Overview:**

**Chain / Tower gang**  
1) Make a bowtie and stand max melee to **avoid baiting 1st cleave**

2) Take 1st tower and move around orbs to 2nd tower

3) Take 2nd tower and move close to boss to **bait 2nd cleave** (in a similar fashion to how orb people take 2nd cleave in Ilya strat.)   


**Orb Tether gang**  
1) Go to edge of boss hitbox on the side **OPPOSITE** to where your orb is (on cardinal)

2) **Bait 1st cleave** then **move to the intercardinal clockwise**  
3) Disengage momentarily (its possible to do this between GCDs as melee) to avoid orb before balls shrink.

4) 2nd Towers resolve + orbs shrink. **Take your orb and avoid 2nd Cleave!**

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**tl;dr:**

Ilya strat makes orb melees (+maybe casters?) super sad and here is a possible alternative.

fhiuwl,Riyujin26,"I just switched to controller and I need to stick with it, I have questions regarding Limit Break Macro &amp; controller in general","Hey, I'd like to use a macro for LB so I can use Right Stick to trigger it.

I have questions now:

Is /ac ""Limit Break"" working? Simply written like this, without &lt;t&gt; or anything else.

I'd like to know if it works for the 3 cases :

\- Melee (does it automaticly casts on target or do i need to add &lt;t&gt; ?)

\- Physical Range (I assume it's the same as melee but from afar, never played ranged DPS yet)

\- Magical Range (I want control over the location of the LB)

Otherwise I'm open for any tips considering this, or the controller in general, if you have advanced details. I love the WXHB honestly, the ability to display &amp; use 32 actions without bar switch is awesome! But I use them using L-&gt;R or R-&gt;L because I don't like double taps, which prevents me from using another 2x8 since WXHB and L-&gt;R / R-&gt;L both refer to HotBar 8.

Since there is no place to test LB in a training room (I wish there was), I could hit trial&amp;errors through DF in dungeons but if someone already knows and could spare me this hassle I'd be glad!",10,1584029886,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhiuwl/i_just_switched_to_controller_and_i_need_to_stick/,ffxiv,1

fhf8eh,OriginalSkill,Getting carried in savage (PF),"I’m new to endgame raiding and discovered that I was consistently getting carried by 1 or 2 guys scoring 90% or more.
I read every single guides and trained on that dummy until me eyes started bleeding and it’s now quite decent according to the dps tool. 
However in a savage fight my rotations get broken up. And I drift off. (Sam). 

I’ve been trying my best for 3 weeks without significant improvement except a purple once in extreme after 10 runs I start to wonder if I shouldn’t just quit since I can’t do endgame. 

I cleared e5s 3 times and e6s twice (0 luck 0 drop)
I’m hesitating to go into e7s practice and be deadweight. I am now also scared to go into reclear and be deadweight (I got kicked and blacklisted once eventho I didn’t fail my mechs because of garbage dps I assume.)
I now understand that without other players pulling higher than required dps I wouldn’t even clear anything. 
I’m also kinda feeling guilty for not contributing much for the clear. 
Joining a static is out of the question since everyone asks for logs ...

fhexcb,Laciole,[NINJA] Let's fix SHUKUCHI please,"Hello,

I want to talk about the nin spell Shukuchi here, which allows us to move from a point to another ""quickly"". 

As you know you have to clic on the floor to use the ability, unless you use a macro such as 

    /micon Shukuchi 
    /ac ""Shukuchi"" &lt;t&gt; 
    /ac ""Shukuchi""  

to jump directly onto your target. 

That's cool. However, I have a huge beef concerning the spell.

Why in the world is it possible to aim Shukuchi (say you play with a mouse on PC), out of range ?! 

(And all those abilities you have to aim on the floor by the way, sacred soil, asylum etc.) 

I mean if you don't want to jump anymore, just right clic to cancel the ability. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Can we have (hi Square Enix o/) a **range cap** on the ability ? Which means if I keep dragging my mouse on my screen as far as I want, it won't go over the maximum range of the spell.

Especially compared to other dps gap closer abilities, isn't that one clunky as hell ? Yes yes you can aim the landing location, that's cute and I loooooooove it, except you have to clic 10 times in a row to get to the exact maximum range, plus while you're moving you're also eating some of this distance as well because the animation takes time. Oh and while you're doing all that people are actually dpsing, you're not.

Opinions ?

fheb7r,lostlight,Easy change class buttons with clean hotbars [Guide],"Pick a hotbar number that is not used, eg 6.

Character Config &gt; Hotbar settings &gt; Display:  make sure 6 is ticked.
Character Config &gt; Hotbar settings &gt; Shared:  make sure 6 is ticked.

Pick a crafter class where you have a lot of unused hotbars, eg CUL. Temporarily you might need to display an extra hotbar here, i picked 7. While on CUL, fill it with your crafter gear sets. After it's ready, you can hide it but remember it was CUL 7.

Go to User Macros and create a new shared macro with these commands:

/hotbar copy CUL 7 share 6
/hotbar display 6

You can place this macro on a shared hotbar (different than 6), and place your shared 6 hotbar near it for a nice effect. Then whenever you want to change to a crafter just click the macro and pick a class, it will go on/off.

See video for example. You can do the same for combat classes, filling hotbar 7 of a different class, eg ALC 7 or BTN 7 etc and making a new macro with the new address.


I've seen similar guides here but i hope this makes it easier.",13,1584009393,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fheb7r/easy_change_class_buttons_with_clean_hotbars_guide/,ffxiv,1
fheaua,Deuxclydion,Updated Diadem visual reference,"Slightly less quick and dirty version.  Thanks to everyone who commented on the previous thread.  No further revisions planned unless some drastic new tech is discovered.

[Image link](https://imgur.com/caKrk8L)

Explanations where necessary:

Mob locations on the old NM isles are now more precisely marked.

""Green"" mats can only be harvested during special Diadem weather.  This applies to both the MIN/BTN items and the special Diadem fish.  

""Chained nodes"" are just clusters of nodes which spawn when the first node in the series is harvested and guarantee node bonus conditions at the end of the chain.  For a more in-depth explanation, see [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhb5be/advanced_guide_to_diadem_farming_map_of_all_nodes/) by u/inippropriate as well as [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b_OFeQkAlAzaCjN4k9IBeIuxo_NvnmE0v9Bo6I9RHTI/edit) by u/hakul

Mob info includes the drop table on the right and the crafts which use it on the left.  Individual crafting materials are only used for a single level of crafts (e.g., if an item is used for a level 70 ARM craft, it will also only be used for level 70 crafts of any other discipline).  

The fishing arrows show the tug strength of the particular fish as well as any mooch requirements.  /u/Alberto-Balsalm has put together a fish table [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wEGuZVumHHRqheBWKgLXVfFgUm-RBD-NnCHVS8wDV8/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true).",12,1584009332,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fheaua/updated_diadem_visual_reference/,ffxiv,1

#See [this map I made](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/570487167680249877/687520082901073935/DIADEM_MAP_BTN.png)! 

This map is useful if you are trying to targetfarm certain items. i.e. if you really need logs, then certain areas are *slightly* better to loop over, instead of circling around the entire map. (see the center of the image for stats on each path).

See the text at the top of the image for a brief explanation. In addition, the timed weather nodes do not affect the active nodes on either of the paths.

I recommend fully charging five bazooka shots, then visiting one of the lower islands, since the mobs spawn in handy groups of five down there. More efficient, movement-wise.

There is nothing inherently red or blue on each path, I just picked those colors.

This is only for Botanist, I haven't done one for Miner but it should work the same way. I used icons for the starred materials, so if you're trying to target farm lower tier materials, you'll need to figure out which items share the same node with the given starred items. Node bonuses (i.e. +1/+2 yield) seem to be entirely random, but I haven't attempted to make sense of it.",46,1583989324,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fhb5be/advanced_guide_to_diadem_farming_map_of_all_nodes/,ffxiv,1

fha1gs,narett,How can I hold a static together?,"I know this is quite general. This question could apply to any MMO, but since FF14 is the one I play, I figured I'd ask here.

How can I hold a static together? Through both Stormblood and Shadowbringers, I've found statics I've joined seem to leak people. The ones I've been in via my FC have been more consistent, but sometimes scheduling conflicts force me to find statics outside my FC - which are normally made up of people for whatever FC across the data center.

Perhaps I'm asking a question that can veer into psychology. Individuals are their own people, and folks may think a static isn't for them or something RL comes about. However, there has to be something a raid leader (or person at least organizing the static) can do or at least look. So far, I've only stuck with looking for people in the Recruitment subreddit and the Primal FFXIV discord's recruitment and pf channels. Here, I've been trying to make sure I find people who align with the goals I have in mind, but that's about 50/50 (or lower) at this point as far as success go.

I have an obsession with fashion in MMO's (as do 99% of those who play lol), and my question is, which race generally looks good in all types of gear? I'm assuming its Hyur, since thats probably the base race the developers use to design armor? Or I could be wrong. But I'd like to hear the community's opinion on this. Reason for this curiosity is, I do plan on at least playing or trying to play a lot of classes (or at least one from each specific type), once i'm experienced enough and have the main shenanigans done, and I want to look good while doing so.

fh5rb5,FaZe_NoSkills,"Newbie here, please forgive in advance","Hi there as stupid as it sounds I’ve never heard of this game and never played any FF14 although got FF7 on pre-order, so I seen an advert for this game on YouTube while watching a video, the video stated you can do anything, be a hero, get married, live a normal life etc. and was greatly intrigued. So first I did a bit of research, this game is an MMORPG, I’ve never played any MMORPG, never played WoW, Skyrim. I’ve watched a few YouTube videos on this game but none of them actually explain anything if I’m honest. Just a bit of background I play on the PS4, I play a variety of games from Assassins Creed, God Of War, Witcher 3, Persona 5, Middle-Earth etc. to games like A.O.T, COD, R6 etc. I have a wide variety of interests and mainly play by myself, I’m an introvert and do get uncomfortable speaking on MIC at times out of shyness/uncertainty etc. None of my friends have played/have this game.  Also I live a very boring life, work Monday-Friday and weekends so I mainly play on weekends, weekdays after work I just binge Netflix/YouTube.

So my first question is what exactly is this game and what’s the purpose?

Is there a story mode, if there is how long does it take?

After story mode what do you do, playtime?

Which edition should I pay for the PS4, I have PS+ and have read you need to pay a subscription charge so how does that work?

Trophies, easy or very hard/unobtainable?

Playing solo/Playing with randomers experience?

Finally is the game worth getting for PS4 in 2020? I know I’m on a FF14 subreddit but what I mean is is it too complicated/too late for a person like me to get into?

I know I’ve rambled on and if you’ve read all of this I thank you very much. I do apologise in advance for my lack of knowledge and if I do sound like an idiot.",25,1583965947,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fh5rb5/newbie_here_please_forgive_in_advance/,ffxiv,1

fh18li,StopFapForever,Whats the point of the game?,"Hi there.
I've been playing for arounr 40 hours the game and I have a question. I'm a huge fan of Final Fantasy, Been playing them since I was a kid and finished like 8 different ones. 

I have however a few doubts because im very disappointed. 

1) I joined FFXIV as it was advertised as a mmorpg, so I though it was something like World of Wacraft, Metin2, Lineage2Revolution.

So far the only thing I've been doing are the main quests and I'm level 50. Msq level 40.

I dont get the point of the game. Is it just doing story quest and random dungeon with the duty finder? Thats all?

2) I've read that there is no way apart from atc to see others people damage. Is not the point of any mmorpg becoming stronger day by day? And how can you become stronger if you dont see how much damage you do compared to others? 

3) What can I do to enjoy more the game apart from really boring msq and dungeon? There is anything that is worth playing? 

I'm getting quite bored and I dont honestly see the point of this game. 

4) Equipment: what are the colors for? like green and blue that's all there is? 
Any legendary gear to craft or something interesting about? One of the biggest challanges in final fantasy XII was crafting legendary equipment. 

5) Gran companion.. Im in Malestrom.. Apart that I cannot do any bounty quest and I dont know why... is anything interesting in ranking up? Is it usefull for something? 

6) I've read you can hire npc both to do dungeons with you and also other missions, but i cant find a clear way of doing it. 

7) Final question... again, whats the point of the game? There is any world boss or daily event or anything that looks like this is a mmorpg? I remember I played gw2 for 2 weeks then I reached lvl 80, gear was maxed and there was nothing else to do so I quitted.",59,1583949169,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fh18li/whats_the_point_of_the_game/,ffxiv,0

fgze51,Jcorb,"So, my sister is REALLY into decorating in-game houses. What would be the best places for her to show off her creations, and potentially advertise decorating others' houses for gil?","My sister is an interesting sort of gamer; she rarely plays *any* video game, but now and then, she plays one and is *obsessed* with it. I bought her FFXIV last year (along with a character boost), and she loved the Housing stuff, but couldn't justify the $15/mo. Since I plan to keep my sub going regardless, but don't play *that* often, I just gave her my account info so she could decorate my house.

Well, she honestly did a bang-up job with it, and apparently put in *hours* of work, just on little details. She's mostly held back by the fact I didn't have much gil to work with.

It's kind of great being able to share something like that with my sis, though, and it clearly makes her happy, so I'm thinking about just having her create another character on my account and maybe boosting it for her so she can have her own house (unless, is there any way to transfer her old character to my account? since I technically paid for it?).

She gets a kick out of it apparently, and I guess has all these ideas for ""themes"" she would like to do. It made me wonder if, maybe there's a sort of market for someone coming in and decorating your house for you? And if so, it would be cool if she could earn her own gil, to fund her making her own house cooler, too (especially since, while I didn't mention it, she basically spent like 4 years worth of my gil decorating, because I don't know how to make money quickly, lol).

Any suggestions or advice I could pass along to her I'm sure she would appreciate!

anyways, i'm a WoW refugee. i played up until legion and have taken a sort of hiatus from MMO's and have been playing fps games mainly, but i heard this was the best one to get into and i wanted to give it a shot.

i'm the kind of person who likes to get to endgame quickly but also like knowing the lore and by the time i get to endgame, i like to feel like i know the aspects of the game really well. i was a mythic raider in WoW but can't find the urge to go back to that game.

this game really looks to be more in depth. i guess i just want some pointers on leveling, classes, and kind of what i can expect from playing this game. i want to get to endgame quickly while also feel like i'm not missing out on anything so quest advice would be helpful as well. 

also, i don't really have any friends that play this game since they're all still on WoW or quit MMO's in general, so some friends to help out would be nice too!

fgy7cu,nineteen_71,Frustrated with crafting and end game.,"Am I the only person frustrated with end game content lately? I feel that since shadow bringers a lot of end game content outside the MSQ has been centered towards crafting. I’ve been playing since ARR and I’ve never felt this way before. It’s so frustrating for me because I played WoW for several years and I found that crafting system rather intuitive and easy to grasp. It felt like something you could do to make money and to help improve yourself for end game content, not the end game content itself. Does that make sense? It never felt like a requirement. Crafting was for enhancing your character and selling/making goods. 

The last time I played WoW was warlords of draenor. Maybe crafting has changed in MMOS and I’m just out of touch. I quit WoW because I love final fantasy and the MSQ story telling. However, lately I’ve been finding myself playing less and less after finishing the MSQ. 

However, In ffxiv, it seems literally like a full time job to grasp and achieve success with crafting. Either I need to start crafting or come to terms I’m missing out on content. It’s frustrating to me that many objects and new game mechanics are locked behind crafting. For example, the new umbrellas, Ishgardian restoration, hairstyles, etc.  

Do you think they devs are being super heavy in pushing content for crafting lately? Am I the only one?",8,1583937790,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgy7cu/frustrated_with_crafting_and_end_game/,ffxiv,1

fgwlaq,Chillyputty,Considering switching main classes again,"I was a tank from ARR to HW and mid HW to SB E1-4 I was a healer main (primarily SCH). SB was my breaking point it seems. I couldn't focus on the fights or feel enthusiastic with the game when more than half of my GCDs are broil or ruin2 if moving. 

I went to SMN a class which after I cleared previous savage tiers I was able to play and play what seemed to be quiet well. This content tier I am sub 50% parse even in week 4 on E5-7. I have read the balance discord's information numerous times and used xivanalysis to get concepts of where to improve. I realize now that I am just not cut out for this but, it puts me in a bad situation. I likely wouldn't do better at BLM and they also require a different set of gear since SPS tiering has changed with this gear set. I cannot find any enjoyment in a class if my performance is so poor.

I have the funds and time to at best try one thing different. I could try tanking again it just seems less viable due to being late in the tier already. I have considered dancer because it allows me to retain the muscle memory learned from a ranged dps. Or I could try going back to scholar again which the WHM I regularly pug with would love but, I don't know if the time away from healing I have spent will be enough to really make it feel better. 

I pug savage everyday with a group of 2-3 others everyday for minimum of 3 hours a day with a GNB WHM and NIN. Sorry if this wall of text was hard to follow seems to be a ramble.",10,1583930825,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgwlaq/considering_switching_main_classes_again/,ffxiv,1

I'm planning to level up my Gunbreaker next but I'm wondering how to properly use defensive cooldowns without ""The Blackest Knight"" being there to save me.

From what I can see, the only defensive skills the Gunbreaker has are Camouflage (10% reduction), Rampart (20% reduction), Nebula (30% reduction), and eventually Heart of Stone (15% reduction) on level 68. Maybe I'm just overthinking all of this, but how does one deal with Tankbusters?

Legendary fish takes a while to catch, be patient! if you get a throw/hook that takes 20ish sec you are probably about to catch one!

Desynth Tip! 

If you desynth fish you will get materials that you get when gathering as a Miner or Botanist! But it all depends on the fish you desynth, From what i know the Vampiric Tapestry, Blind Manta and Gobbie Mask all give Miner materials! 

So most likely the Tupuxuara, Rhomaleosaurus and one more gives Botanist materials!

&amp;#x200B;

Legendary fish gives 50 scrips each and around 175 points

while the 1 star fishes gives 40 scrips each and around 1500 points each! These fishes can be caught randomly from !! pulls or mooching, atleast thats what ive noticed (may be wrong)

&amp;#x200B;

fgqk9l,PassingGamer,FF14 Patch 5.2 Crafting Basics,"I initially started working on this to help my Free Company on Malboro as a resource for the players taking up crafting fresh, or trying to get a better understanding of how it worked overall after the changes.  Regardless of my initial motivation, I am putting it on Reddit partly for easier access, and also to let a wider range of players have access to it since it may be of use to them.  May you all find enjoyment in your gaming choices.

So you want to start crafting, or just want to get a better understanding of how it all works.  This guide will lay it out in a way that tries to explain the basics of crafting.  This is not intended to tell you how to expertly craft level 80 3-star items, but rather build a foundation of knowledge to support you learning how to craft things without just copy and pasting a macro.  Partly as a result of my own missteps learning crafting when it wasn't quite so easy, I am aiming to help people have a broader view of crafting.  Getting too boxed into thinking you have to do things a set way will limit the flexibility of thought needed to adjust to circumstances, or take advantage of unexpected procs.

&amp;#x200B;

**To start out, let's discuss the purpose of crafting.**

The point is to actually complete the item, or you will likely lose your materials.  Getting a HQ high quality/collectability result is great, but if it breaks you don't get anything.  Therefore the way I approach anything that I am unsure of is to get my progress to 1 step away from complete before working on quality/collectability, that way I can finish it at any time with a single action.  It really comes down to doing the math, since the game already provides you with good information about the costs and results of the actions.  Also, having level appropriate gear, with materia to compliment what you are lacking is important.  30 minute food buffs are also of great help, and can be stacked with 15 minute tea buffs.  These are typically more important after you reach level 50 with a deeper pool of stats.  Also keep in mind that the difference between your level and the project level will affect the performance of your actions.  If your level is higher you gain an advantage, but if it's lower you are at a disadvantage.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Second is your resources and lifelines during crafting.**

**Resources** 

These are the durability of the project, and your CP crafting points.  Actions that increase progress or quality directly will lower a set amount of durability, which can be mitigated with certain other actions.  Many of them will also cost CP if they have increased output or grant short term buffs to other actions.  You should always be mindful of what your durability and CP are during crafting, and you will notice that the resource you run low on the quickest in most projects is your CP.  One nice thing I've found is that as long as your last action completes the project, it doesn't matter if the action would have put durability negative.

The game checks things is this order for the most part.  Do you have enough CP to execute the action?  Is the project complete?  What is the remaining durability?  Is there an action that restores durability after each step?  Therefore if you have 5 durability left and use an action that requires 10 or 20 that finishes it, then it won't bother to notice that you went to zero or negative durability and break the project.  Unfortunately in this situation if you don't finish it with a durability restoration buff on, it is still going to break prior to the restoration due to the logic flow of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifelines** 

These are the information that the game provides in the crafting window or crafting log, and the calculations window you can open in the lower left of the craft window.  This will show you exactly what progress or quality increase you can expect from specific actions under your current buffs and material condition.  Using this information can greatly improve your ability to plan what actions to use.  Some actions with a higher output become active under good or excellent status, but only the quality actions benefit from increased effect or penalty of project status.  The calculations will appropriately reflect the impact of the status.

These are the impacts on output of quality actions under the 4 possible status.

**Normal** 100% of base action

**Good** 200% of base Quality action, returns to **normal** on next step

**Excellent** 400% of base Quality action

**Poor** 50% of base Quality action, comes immediately after an **excellent** proc (can use Observe to skip or Progress action which is unaffected)

In the crafting log are several helpful functions.  While the recipes are already broken down into level, craft, learned books, and special recipes.  You can also use the **search** function to quickly find a particular recipe.  By right clicking on an item you can also get a menu with 2 breakdown options for total materials needed.  The first of these is **Recipe Tree** which shows all materials needed broken out in steps for sub crafted materials.  The second is **Raw Material List** which is a simple total material list.  Using these can allow you to more easily plan what materials you will need, and potential sub materials that need crafting in order to complete the final project.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Normal crafting versus collectables**.

**First** of all not all items are able to be made as collectables, as they are only used to turn in for crafting scripts.  Normal crafting uses assorted materials of either normal or high quality to make a standard item.  Using high quality ingredients will give you an initial boost to the quality value at the start of the project, which relies of variables for how much impact it has.  These are your level, project level, number of ingredient that are high quality.  Some projects, like furniture, do not benefit from quality at all, so don't waste resources on it.

**Second**, collectables are turned in to either Rowena via the Collectable Appraiser or to special weekly spots for custom deliveries, which are unlocked by a chain of quests with a handful of potential projects.  The main differences are that Rowena takes in collectables made from normal materials, which you can make collectable by toggling the Collectable Synthesis buff.  Whereas custom deliveries use special vendor sold materials near the turn in location for their construction, but are limited to 6 per location and 12 per week total.  If you complete a collectable without reaching the minimum required collectability, you have the option of completing it as a non-collectable where it treats it as a normal %chance of high quality result.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Actions and buffs.**

There are 4 basic types of actions that you will gain for use in crafting.  **Progress, Quality, Restoration, and Buffs**.  I'll break down what these cover as I see it.

**Progress gets the finish done:**

Basic Synthesis

Rapid Synthesis (some risk with high progress)

Brand of the Elements (used after Name of the Elements)

Careful Synthesis 

Groundwork (greater progress with higher CP cost)

Focused Synthesis (used after Observe)

Delicate Synthesis (also increases quality at the same time)

Intensive Synthesis (increased progress when good/excellent proc)

&amp;#x200B;

**Quality gives a higher grade result but higher CP cost:**

Basic Touch

Hasty Touch (no CP cost but risk of failure)

Standard Touch

Byregot's Blessing (increased output based on Inner Quiet stack size consumed)

Precise Touch (increased progress when good/excellent proc)

Patient Touch (Gambler's lure, double inner quiet when successful, halves it when fails)

Prudent Touch (lower durability cost if Waste Not is not active)

Focused Touch (used after Observe)

Preparatory Touch (greater quality with higher CP cost)

Delicate Synthesis (also increases progress at the same time)

Trained Eye (restricted first step only use, max quality if recipe is 10 levels lower)

&amp;#x200B;

**Restoration covers both durability and CP reduction/replenishment:**

Master's Mend (restores durability at cost of CP)

Tricks of the Trade (restores 20 CP, only available with good/excellent proc)

Waste Not 1 and 2 (reduces durability wear at cost of CP)

&amp;#x200B;

**Buffs improve the performance of actions:**

Inner Quiet (stacks up to 11, grants increase to quality actions)

Observe (passes single step with no action, and activates 2 special actions)

Veneration (increases progress actions 50% 4 steps)

Great Strides (100% boost next quality action within 3 steps \*best result with higher inner quiet stack and followed with Byregot's Blessing\*)

Innovation (increases quality actions 50% 4 steps)

Name of the Elements (increases effectiveness of Brand of the Elements 3 steps)

Final Appraisal (prevents accidental project completion once for 5 steps)

Collectable Synthesis (changes quality value to collectability value on collectable projects)

Muscle Memory (restricted first step only use, increases progress 300% of stat and increases next progress action 100% used within 5 steps)

Manipulation (restores 5 durability after completion of a step for 8 steps \*durability cost will occur before restoration\*)

Reflect (restricted first step only use, increases quality by 100% of skill then activates Inner Quiet with 3 stacks)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*Finally* here are some examples of the interactions of buffs, actions, and restoration with examples of procs.  Please remember to always keep an eye on your Durability and CP numbers.

**Progress starter:**

Muscle Memory, Veneration, Waste Not, \*options\* Rapid Synthesis (risky)/Basic or Careful Synthesis/Groundwork (greater durability cost)/good or excellent proc Intensive Synthesis.

*This will provide a burst of initial progress toward the completion of the project.*

**Quality starter:**

Reflect, Waste Not, Innovation, \*options\* Basic/Standard/Preparatory Touch or Precise Touch with good or excellent proc

*If you are confident about your ability to complete the project without boosts, and aiming for increasing quality.  This would provide a boost to quality at the start.*

**Quality finish:**

\*with Inner quiet stacks\* Innovation, Greater Strides, Byregot's Blessing

*This will greatly increase the effectiveness of Byregot's Blessing for a burst of quality/collectability.*

**Proc advantage:**

X action, \*excellent proc\* Precise Touch, Observe, Focused Synthesis or Touch

*This will take advantage of the increased impact on touch actions, and bypass the poor step, while taking advantage of the other low cost skills that activate from Observe.*

**Durability preservation:**

They are reassured by other players that there is plenty to do but Im having trouble finding specifics. I am personally into raiding and doing dungeons which is why I would like to max lvl (currently lvl 61) and do end game content with others. Overall I feel like there is a lot of content in ARR and Heavensward that I have missed. Any reccomendations on what I should be doing as an alternative to MSQ?

Some jerkwad out there set up a scam-site meant to trick folks who may not be aware of this sort of thing - such as *children* \- into giving them their account details. Their bald-faced lie is that they're a new ""merching"" guild that can get players **30 million** gil a day which... well, that's just an absurd claim no matter how you spin it.

Now I know I might come across as a little silly even pointing out something this obviously point-blank scammy, but please bear in mind that not everyone will know how to suss out something like this. People get bamboozled by these sorts of gross shenanigans every day such as, and I don't think I can stress this hard enough, *children*... and also me from like five years ago.

There is no profit to make honestly.  On the other hand when 5.2 or any previous patch is releasing with new crafted battle gear you can see how it's totally different because of the gear (overmelding) and crafting book restrictions. Something along the line of experienced crafters don't undercut each other. One can argue that a cheaper marketboard is better but I'm not really sold on that.

 I'm from bryn, play DRK and SMN (and WHM if you have a deathwish.) I like collecting mounts, glamours, minions, and big swords. All of my armor is jet black and I refuse to apologize. Au Ra are my favorite race. I started the game around the start of havensward, then took a break at the start of stormblood and came back near the end. Most of the time I spent isolated with my partner or alone. We had a friend show us the game and he gave us alot of misinformation and lies and we enjoyed it more when we got to play on our own and found classes with liked.  My experience with the community has been terrible so far, and lets just say I've had my fair share of gaslighting FC/LS leaders. I don't trust the fc listings because usually when they label themselves casual they arn't actually casual (or chill. or drama free. oof.)  we have our own personal FC for storage and a shared house but we're willing to leave if we find one full of people we're comfortable enough with.

fgln08,thatnigakanary,Should I give this game another chance?,"Context about myself; I'm a 10 year+ WoW player and the only FF game I've played besides this is 10 which is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. Just saying this so you guys know I'm familiar with the grind of mmos and rpgs in general.  I really do want to love this game, trust me. I also know WoW's story is pretty bad and the only reason people like it is because they grew up playing Warcraft which I have never touched in my life

&amp;#x200B;

Around 3 or 4 months ago I bought all the content there was for this game, made it through the entire original content and then boosted past the rest of that garbage nothing content between expansions because it almost made me quit. I would personally give it like a 2/10, but that's besides the point. The next expansion with the dragon/dragoons, I absolutely loved. I forget the name but I know you guys know what it is. 8/10.

&amp;#x200B;

Then the next expansion rolls around and I would probably say it was by far the worst part of the game for me, but I somehow made it through with lots of discord calls and movies on my 2nd monitor. Definitely not a great experience for me. Literally 0/10 because I don't remember a single thing about it since I tuned most of the story out once I was 100% sure I had 0 investment in whatever was going on. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point I had probably over 100 hours in the game or so, and just had such a bad taste in my mouth that I couldn't enjoy the last expansion. I got around halfway through it before not being able to play anymore and regretfully quit. I seriously don't know what it is about this game and its story, but I would call it the opposite of engaging. I don't want to hate on it at all because like I said I really do want to love this game because it's amazing in every way I could see except for the story. I think there's just something about a lot of the dialogue scenes being insanely long and also insanely stiff and dry. I felt like the characters were just saying things that didn't matter at all even if they did.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone could give me some reasons as to why they enjoyed the story, if they didn't at all, or even tell me I'm just a retard who doesn't like good stories even though that's definitely not true.",15,1583876444,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgln08/should_i_give_this_game_another_chance/,ffxiv,1

Cue the Auger. Stephanien has been holding out on us. This bad boy with a cast time of just around 3 seconds does a whopping ***2.96 million*** damage in a single charge, and he gave us 5 charges to load up. That's 14.8 million DPS any old botanist or miner can just freely wander around with tucked away on their back. An 8 man party of gatherers could, in just 15 seconds, unleash a whopping 118,400,000 DPS on an unsuspecting target, and a full alliance a mind-boggling 355,200,000 DPS. 

But you say ""oh those are just numbers those don't mean anything."" So lets add perspective. Your average fully faceted gatherer has around 18,700HP. If they took a single hit from an auger, it would kill them *157 times over*. We don't need white auracite. We just need everyone armed with Augers.

The legendary fishes are super slow to catch, but if you get a hook that takes longer than15-20 sec you usually will get one!  No mooch required and will be caught on !!!

&amp;#x200B;

Desynth Tip!

Different Fish gives different type of materials!

Currently a bit unsure on which gives what, but im certain that 

Vampiric Tapestry + Mantra + Goobie Mask all gives miner materials 

and that Tupuxuara and Rhomaleosaurus give Botanist

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13wEGuZVumHHRqheBWKgLXVfFgUm-RBD-NnCHVS8wDV8/edit#gid=0

Much of this information was gathered from this post thanks to /u/CuriousBlackMage:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgexg1/diadem_fishing_spots_some_information/

A few things to note:

There are 4 skyfishing locations (Blustery, Calm, Swirling and Windswept).  Each of these locations has a rare green fish that is catchable during specific Umbral weather.  They are worth 50 scrips and 175 points.

Two of the skyfishing locations (Blustery &amp; Calm) has a rare fish that can be Mooched with a Cloud Cutter that are worth 40 scrips and 1580 points!  The other two locations (Swirling &amp; Windswept) has a rare fish that appears to be a straight catch and are worth 15 scrips and 150 points (not sure if the type of bait matters or not).

Bait for the regular fish does not seem to matter though different baits at different locations appear to have different cast times.

The other two fishing locations are lakes that appear to just be for leveling.

Once you get your fish approved in Ishgard you can desynth them for lots of Grade 2 Approved crafting items.",17,1583870431,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgjzol/diadem_521_fishing_guide/,ffxiv,1

fgj0c0,TheLightningCount1,Why do people think shielding is healing?,"Can people explain this mentality? Shielding is not the same as healing. Yes shielding does mean less healing needs to happen, but thats beside the point. 

You cant claim you spend 30 minutes exercising if you chose not to eat a piece of cake at lunch. 

On top of this, lets look at GCD usage for shielding vs healing. 1 OGCD and 1 GCD to shield a party. If the damage is heavy enough or if another raid wide goes out after that, then 2-4 GCDs and 1 OGCD will be needed to heal the party up before the next Raid Wide. 

Lets look at a real example. End of E5S. Ramuh will spam his aoe. SCH can shield the first, maybe 3rd one, on this but the vast majority of the healing will need to be done by the WHM. 

First AOE goes off, Medica 2 Asylum thrown down followed by a medica. (Med 1 has higher base healing than Med 2 so spamming 2 is a waste.) If I can ACTUALLY get everyone close enough I can just use Cure 3 but good luck ever doing that. 

Grab orb and second one goes off. Pop Temperance. 

PI plus Rapture. Med 2 and Asylum still up. Will drop before next AOE. SCH shields and next AOE goes out. Med 2 followed by another Rapture. 

Temperance drops

Shields go out again. AOE pops and we ignore the healing as the next attack is enrage. No reason to heal up the damage. 

The shielding helped mitigate damage, but did not heal any of it up. Its annoying and I wish FFLOGS would stop posting shielding as healing. Its not.",73,1583866942,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fgj0c0/why_do_people_think_shielding_is_healing/,ffxiv,1

fgiokm,unlimitedblack,A very basic map question,"So the top level of the world map lists the following zone categories, in order:

* La Noscea
* The Black Shroud
* Thanalan
* Coerthas
* Mor Dhona
* Abalathia's Spine
* Dravania
* Gyr Abania
* Hingashi
* Othard
* Norvrandt
* ???

You can see how these correspond to how we come in contact with these various areas: La Noscea, the Black Shroud, and Thanalan are where the starting cities are located, Coerthas is a mid-level zone (before giving way to additional content in Heavensward), Mor Dhona is a 45-50 endgame zone, Abalathia's Spine and Dravania are regions added in Heavensward, Gyr Abania is where we start Stormblood, then hit Kugane in Hingashi before moving onto Othard. Norvrandt is obviously Shadowbringers content.

fgf5kb,LoucyndaTheMage,Am I doing this right?,"So I’m a bit conflicted. I started playing FFXIV a year ago today. I had stopped after about 2 months while I was moving. So I’m just now getting back into the game. 

I’m familiar with MMO’s as I played WoW for 10 years but I don’t feel like I’m playing this game to its full potential. I feel like I’ve missed a bunch of information somehow. For example, it took me forever to find out what to do with Poetics after I got them until I finally sat and googled it after an hour. Then I had to buy a weapon, but some extra stuff, then take it to a guy near Gridania to upgrade it? With me being so new and having a mentor help me, I would have never known to do that if I didn’t have help. Did I miss a quest that tells you how to do that? Or is that just common knowledge to do that after so long? 

All these blue unlockable quests. Am I supposed to do everyone of them? Or are some more needed than others?

What is materia and what am I supposed to do with it? Is it max level stuff that I shouldn’t worry about at lvl 60?

I love the game so far and am completely invested in it, I just feel like I need some guidance. 

Thank you for any help or tips you may have for me.

[https://imgur.com/a/Jko8peS](https://imgur.com/a/Jko8peS)

Not the best I know, was a bit low on time in the instance, but hopefully at least this gives a starting point.

Skyfishing spots seems to share on the fishies, except what you can catch with the moochable fish cloud cutter.

At spot 1, its the Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilder's Skyfish. (Someone told me in the instance I was in, haven't caught myself yet, so confirmation needed).

Spot 2, its Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilder's gobbie mask. Light '!' tug.

Spot 3, seems it exist for leveling, didn't caught any special fish there.

Spot 4, Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilder's Rhomaleosaurus (medium '!!' tug). Its where I caught a green fish, Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilder's Cometfish during the fire weather, using Diadem Ballon Bug as a bait. Straight catch, no mooch.

All of the Artisanal fish can be double hooked, it gives two.

fgd04j,Laciole,HUD - Display action/item HELP !,"Hello, 

I have an issue concerning my HUD on PC:

I want to remove the skills description from my hotbar because even though I mostly use keyboard shortcuts it happens to me to clic on spells from time to time, and the description box overlaps some other spells and I can't see what's underneath. Makes me miss clic the next one etc... you get the idea.

I removed the skills description using the setting in the picture below, but here's the problem: it also removes the items description when I hover over items in inventory, character log etc... 

1. If I fix the position of those 2 in a corner of my screen (where it doesn't bother me much) it's all good for the skills description but what I don't like is the items one is also fixed. Meaning, if I open a window on the left side of my screen and hover over an item, the description is on the other side for example. Not so intuitive to me.
2. I've tried to play with the HUD layout by right-clicking the ""action description"" box so I can completely hide it (name appears violet when it's off), while still keeping the item description box locked to my mouse. Which is great...however ! If now i want to check some gcd cooldowns or other things **via the skills log** (say I meld materias, compare gear effect, want to check a skill potency etc.), the description is also gone there ! 

So it's all or nothing. And toogling on and off all the time to check an ability is a pain in the butt :)

**Hence my question:** is there a way... to keep the items descriptions (inventory, character log,...) locked to the mouse position when I hover over it, to remove the skills descriptions to appear on the hotbar, BUT to keep them in the skills log ?

(I've also played with opacity but I don't like it it looks like something is flickering)

My main problem is my gear, I'm using the Landking's Gear and that seems to not be good enough to do the higher levels nodes and to farm the White Scripts. 

So it seems that I have to update the gear, the problem is that I'm completely broke and I don't know how to make Gil in this game. Everywhere i read and everthing people tell me:

1) is to farm the newest unspoiled nodes (i suppose that those are the highest level ones), and should I farm ephemeral nodes? if yes should I farm the ephemeral nodes from previous patchs?

fga54t,iBelias,[Discussion] Idea to redo the Glamour Dye System sometime in the Future,"Hi Guys! Maybe some of you can relate to the following situation:  
You see an Armor you dig, want to glamour it but you notice the sections that are dyeable  
are completely off, not what you imagined. or you dye said Armor, yet a certain color persists and you cant get rid of it, ruining your desired outcome.  
Sometimes, if you dye Glamours, all partitions of said Glamour become this weird one-colored thing with different tones of the same color.  


In Other MMOs, its possible to dye different parts of the same equipment to get a more unique look.  
FFXIV is still my favourite MMO, but i would totally LOVE when Yoshi-P would consider reworking the Dye System to allow us to dye armors in multiple sections.  


I Know, maybe this isn't Possible with the current Spaghetti Coding going on, or maybe this is silly, but i thought about making this Petition to maybe reach Yoshi-P, so he may notice and aknowledge this wish. Maybe, sometime in the Future, they could work on something similar. Sry if this sounds stupid or if my English is bad, tried my best.

I'm new so I get it, people die and I die too. And my log parses aren't great (just finally hit a 40% parse in 475 gear?) But seriously there was a SCH spamming Pys. and people that place clouds all over the place or don't stand in the right spots.

I have gotten spammed so many times by mentors joining some sort of chat network.

fg89ay,Pr1nceFluffy,I've learned a lesson today. Check the player's search information before possibly wasting your time being nice.,"Just went to bed after a painful experience in Cutter's Cry. I'll partially chalk it up to my patience and kindness, because I missed so many red flags from the two griefers I played with.

Tank and Healer were both playing dumb. In hindsight, too dumb for being synced Lvl 40 in the dungeon. There was all sorts of red flags being thrown between them, including simple things such as not using Party Chat, and the healer not having a job stone. (CNJ instead of WHM)

After wiping more than ten times and giving out tons of advice like the patient player I was, I checked their search info. They were both level 70 in their respective classes. It was a huge waste of time, and they were basically in control of the griefing since they were Tank and Healer.

The silver lining is that was the first time I've experienced this problem in my 9 months of playing.

fg82pi,nasurak,Why I uninstalled this game after 3 weeks despite loving it.,"I tried this game back when it was released at 2.0 ARR and had a lot of fun with it.  The game was new, everyone was friendly, and I had a great time.  Financial issues forced me to leave the game, and I recently re-purchased the game for PS4 and PC along with all of its expansions, excited to get back into it.  The graphics, music, presentation and story are all fantastic.  I was a huge fan of FFXI and FF in general, and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the world and make friends.  But, as soon as I made it to Heavensward, things changed.

Last night I unsubbed and uninstalled.  Why?  My experience with the community.

I heard that this game has the friendliest community of any MMO, and back in 2013, it was.  Trying to re-learn the game, ask for help, make friends has been such an absolute nightmare.  I rarely talk in game, except to say that I'm new and to please take it slow.  There is such an emphasis on rushing as fast as humanly possible through every encounter that I never get the chance to actually learn any of the mechanics, even when I ask my team to please take it slow.  

I made several positive posts, and a few questions, and every single post on this subreddit was immediately downvoted hard by ""Gatekeepers"" until the rest of the users come in and upvote submissions.  It was very disheartening as a new person in the community to have every single post and question downvoted to 22% approval within minutes, and creates a very unwelcoming environment.  And I see this for every single post, regardless of quality, until other users come on and upvote good posts to &gt; 60%.  Why is this necessary to downvote a newbie showing off their character, or someone showing off their artwork, or someone just beaming about how much they love the game?  Why are all of these posts immediately downvote bombed? 

I took a lot of time before entering my first dungeon to read guides, read posts on here, on r/talesfromDF to see what the main sticking points are, how to be a good WHM, how to be a good teammate, and for the most part, it has helped a lot, when things go well.    

However, the second that anything goes wrong in a run, that's when the belitting and blaming starts, either directed at the healer or the tank.  Multiple times in sub-40 dungeon roulettes, I have had tanks rush in, wall to wall pull, refuse to use a single mitigation ability and then die, while everyone then blames the sprout healer for not being good enough to keep the tank alive.  I didn't have holy, benediction, or any other emergency tools, there was nothing I could do besides cure spam and apply regen, but I got ""WTF THIS HEALER DOING???"" from the dps, and I decided to leave the duty.  I had several more experiences like this from over pulls, stun mechanics in boss fights - people lose their temper after a single death, it puts such anxiety on new players that I just don't even want to play.

When NPCs say that the story is about to go into a dungeon or trial, I get a lump of anxiety from thinking about duty finder and wish I could just go through it solo.

The first two times it happened, I got very upset.  I thought I did something wrong, so I took the time to study other class's skills and class abilities, and paid attention in my next sub-45 dungeon roulette, and sure enough, the tank refused to use any mitigation on a large pull, died, and flamed the WHM.  It was the 3rd or 4th time I had people go ""this stupid whm"" in three weeks, that I just uninstalled the game and canceled my sub after my last run in stone vigil.  

Not once did people offer any kind of advice or help, they just immediately jumped to the blame game.  Each time this happened, I quit the duty and logged off, and my interest in the story and lore has carried me through these bad experiences.  I was considering just playing the game with all party chat muted, like how I played League, but ultimately decided that it just wasn't worth the stress.",16,1583813460,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fg82pi/why_i_uninstalled_this_game_after_3_weeks_despite/,ffxiv,1

fg5vua,iSmackiNQ,[Spoiler]Missing something from the trailer...,"Hello everyone, 

This is a very short/dumb question, but here goes...

So a while back when I was watching the trailer for 5.2, I recall seeing parts with Cid and Mikoto. I believed that I had experienced all of the new content from this patch (besides Savage/Extreme, not my cup of tea) besides those events with them.

Can anyone give me a hint on where I can start the quest for that? I don't even see anything about it in the patch notes. Is this something that will come at a later patch, if so any ideas which?

For what I'm talking about, it's these scenes from the trailer: [https://youtu.be/tM3-wh-zUJI?t=130](https://youtu.be/tM3-wh-zUJI?t=130)

fg5u0a,metroidcomposite,The Tank level 1 trait (Tank Mastery) and its misleading tooltip.,"I've been told that the tooltip on the ShB level 1 trait, Tank Mastery, is poorly translated, but I never looked it up myself, so looking up the original Japanese:

&gt; 自身の被ダメージを20％軽減させる。
&gt;
&gt; また、ＶＩＴの上昇に伴う最大ＨＰの上昇量と、ＳＴＲの上昇に伴う与ダメージの上昇量に対して、Tankロール固有の補正がかかる。

And then feeding this into Google Translate:

&gt; Reduces damage taken by 20%.
&gt;
&gt; In addition, a tank roll-specific correction is applied to the increase amount of the maximum HP with the increase of the VIT and the increase amount of the damage caused by the increase of the STR.

A tank role-specific correction for how VIT translates into HP; and a tank role-specific correction on how STR translates into damage.

What is this correction?  [Well...we do actually have the numbers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpfKYmf31FpES3IHOrl3H8phU4Np8FChH4B4lP1ZE08/edit#)

* VIT for tanks **x 31.5**
* VIT for non-tanks **x 22.1**

* Damage for tanks: **115 ×**
* Damage for non-tanks: **165 ×**

HP multiplier from VIT is increased on tanks, damage multiplier for strength is decreased on tanks.

However, the English translation does seem to be causing confusion.  Here's the English translation:

&gt; Reduces damage taken by 20%. Furthermore, grants a bonus to maximum HP based on your vitality attribute, and a bonus to damage dealt based on your strength attribute.

The English translation sure makes it sound like the trait increases tank damage.

Maybe the English tooltip should be fixed?",32,1583803510,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fg5u0a/the_tank_level_1_trait_tank_mastery_and_its/,ffxiv,1

I have 2 characters in 2 different worlds in the game. One’s a Thaumaturge, the other a Gladiator.

Is it possible to send gil from one world to another? And can I do it, if possible, without both characters being active at the same time?

I play on a PS4 with controller. I’ve tried using the party finder in the system, but I suppose because both aren’t on at the same time It doesn’t show the other character.

My Gladiator is just starting out and has hit lvl 30 and it’s become rather difficult to get gil. My Thaumaturge, on the other hand, is at lvl70 and has over 1million gil and I’d like to help my Gladiator out!

fg3rsx,Superflaming85,A certain major event in 2.5 makes a lot more sense with the information we learned in 5.2.,"So, way back in 2.5, a major event occurred in the setup for Heavensward. The Warrior of Light went to the Keeper of the Lake and met Midgardsormr for the first time. At this meeting, Middy sealed away the WoL's Blessing of Light, power given to us by Hydaelyn. 

This is one of the first notable moments of the Echo and the Blessing being shown as two very different things, and even at the time some people were confused as to why we still had the Echo even though we lost the blessing. 

So why didn't Middy seal away the Echo, too, if it was also a gift from Hydaelyn? 

Enter 5.2, which reveals that the Echo is tied to fractured Amaurotine souls, and that what we thought was cause and effect was inverted. The Echo isn't a gift from Hydaelyn, it's what allows you to hear her in the first place. 

And that's why the Echo wasn't sealed away by Midgardsormr! It's something we naturally awakened to, and isn't directly tied to Hydaelyn!",83,1583795118,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fg3rsx/a_certain_major_event_in_25_makes_a_lot_more/,ffxiv,1

fg35g3,emforay216,Rant about the new Frontline map (PvP thread),"I've been playing Frontline a decent bit since Heavensward, and Rival Wings when there's that once in a blue moon chance to actually play that. I've always been into RvR type PvP, and these modes are the closest thing to that in FFXIV. Imo, Frontlines as a whole have gone pretty downhill since they removed Slaughter, which is basically just a Frontline that allows you to actually PvP the entire time (I miss it so much). The HW Frontlines aren't too bad though, at least they somewhat encourage PvP, and the maps are good sized so you're not fighting in front of someone's spawn usually if a team fight DOES break out. Hell, Shatter actually has a very nice amount of teamfights with its big crystals.

Now, onto the map of the hour, Danshig Naadam... this map is just terrible. The main issue, imo, is its size. It's WAY too small, maybe it would work in 24-man Frontlines but guess what they did with those when they released this map? Honestly, I think this Frontline would be pretty great if it WERE 24-man, by default, always. At least the size would make somewhat sense then. Also, teamfights feel terrible when they actually do happen. First off, the only arguably good teamfights that happen, are in the middle area of the map, where undoubtedly they were designed to happen. Teamfights aside from that? Almost always one team facerolling the other, or one team will get pinched in a matter of seconds because it probably doesn't even take 30 seconds to go from one end of the map to the other. The objectives the map has i'm not too crazy about either. Seize was probably my least favorite objective before this, and that's the system they decided to go with for this map as well. Also, as if decent teamfights weren't rare enough, objectives spawning literally force you to break it up to go cap that objective, can't tell you how many times i've gotten to a teamfight and 5 seconds later my team disappeared and the last few poor saps who thought this was a PvP mode get steamrolled.

So, in conclusion, if it were up to me I would probably double the size of the map and make the objectives something your team needs to stack on, opposed to 1 guy going to pick it up, kinda like Secure. That could work for B ranks, but idk how I feel about Bs and Ss having the same amount of effort to get. Also I think Rival Wings is very fun, much more fun than Frontline, so I hope the Discord server stops its delay of it because I think most people who enjoy large-scale PvP have just about had it with this map. Make a Rival Wings roulette for the love of god.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Map way too small, limits the good part of Frontline. Good teamfights rarely happen outside of mid. Objectives should be changed, recommend having to stack on them like Secure. Getting this map everytime is tiring. Rival Wings roulette pls.",6,1583792729,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fg35g3/rant_about_the_new_frontline_map_pvp_thread/,ffxiv,1

I just started playing this amazing game and started getting my friends into this game. 
I was curious if I end up getting a 2 player mount (I am eyeing the Indigo Whale on Mogstation) can I help someone who just started playing the game with it, this person has zero access to mounts and is still level one. 
I’d like to know before buying it - I also have 10 Gold Chocobo Feathers and I am waiting on 5 more for Twintania, I know I can get the Amber Draught Chocobo as well as a 2 player mount but I’d rather wait off on that.

fg0ak4,kkl4261,LB1 on the first comet during Ruby EX phase 2?,"It's a JP strategy that comes up during the first week of 5.2 patch release. Basically, melee uses LB on the first comet the tank is holding to speed up the kill

During that time, the item level of everyone is just around 470 (occasionally 480 crafter) and a lot of time tanks didn't survive long enough for DPS to destroy the comet, causing a wipe. So it is suggested to use LB during that part. During my first few raid practice, I (DRG) didn't use LB on the comet and the second tank almost always died. That was when I started using LB1 on the first comet to be safe. I have been using LB1 on comet during the first week of release. Right now, I only use LB when DPS died before the comet thing because everyone has higher iL now.

However, there was a time when 2 DPS died right before the comet and I used LBs on both comet because there wouldn't be enough damage. Then the boss enraged and we couldn't pass the DPS check. Then the tank screamed at me ""DON'T USE LB ON A FUCKING STONE"" and quit.

So I am wondering if the EN community is aware of the LB on comet strat and what are your thoughts on it?",21,1583782309,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fg0ak4/lb1_on_the_first_comet_during_ruby_ex_phase_2/,ffxiv,1

ffzua7,gigaBiteGirl,A few account related questions.,"So I am finally getting into FFX!V and can't wait. I have an old account I have barely used but i think FF7 on Steam might be registered to it and maybe I played a tiny bit of realm reborn when it came out but I can't be sure.

I have a few problems with the account, mainly that I can't change my own name in it, like my actual real life name. Also I would love to be able to change the ID name itself as right now it's something I just never use any longer.

Thing about my name is that I am going to change it soon and I don't want my account to not have my real name. I could make a new account I guess but then i have to ask, can you have several accounts under the same email? Will me making a new account make me unable to play FF7 on steam?  
And If I bind an account to my PS account can I unbind it later?  


Basically some anxiety over this but the biggest issue for me is the name. Do I have to wait until I legally change my name before making a new account with my new legal name or can I change the name somehow?",9,1583780704,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffzua7/a_few_account_related_questions/,ffxiv,1

ffxltt,BladeOfThePoet,"Useless Math Time! MCH, Wildfire, and the Nabriales","I came across an image showing a Dancer's buff timer being over 400 seconds in the Chrysallis fight, because of when Nabri boy starts messing with time and all active effects have their timers multiplied by ten, and I thought ""Wow, imagine the Wildfire you could hit with that""

So out of nothing but curiosity I got to trying to calculate that. We're going off the probably wrong assumption that it'll increase both Wildfire and Overheat's timers to 100 seconds 

Starting off with potency, Wildfire's increases by 200 for each weaponskill landed while it's going. With the aforementioned assumptions, you can land 66 Heat Blasts in this time, meaning a WHOPPING 13200 potency!

Now, damage! As I have NO idea whatsoever what the potency/damage formula is, I recurred to the god ol' rule of threes, using Air Anchor's numbers for it. My air anchor without critting or direct hitting is about 25k a pop for 700 potency (data is iffy at best so will do more tests). So we do 700/25000=13200/x, do the math, carry the one, get a headache cuz math, and we get...

Roughly 470,000 damage in one good blow!

ffr8as,Drakereinz,Should I macro?,"I come from playing MMOs that have much fewer buttons to press. I consider an MMO that I played for more than 6 months to be one that I got adequate at. My MMO chronology goes like this: Runescape, Endless Online, Ragnarok Online, Aion, more RO, Tera, Blade and Soul, more RO, and now FF14.

I’ve played a lot more than that, but not for long periods of time. The 2 MMOs that I got the best at were Tera, and Blade and Soul. Both of these games didn’t have very many buttons to press, but the combat was still very complex because of the nature of action combat.

Now that I’m playing FF14, I feel like I’m having a really hard time finding proper buttons to press, because I never really had to press more than 12 buttons and use modifiers.

Right now my hotbar is 1234QERFZXCV, then on top the exact same with shift modifier. On the left I have 5 macro buttons on my black widow that I use for numpad skills, and on my mouse I have 4 buttons, 2 of which I use for skills, 1 mount, one extra, and one I use for shift because I have a really hard time pressing shift and another button at the same time while I’m trying to move in a fight.

I misclick a lot, and I have a hard time hitting those 5 macro buttons on the left. I’m using them all for role skills.

I play a dragoon, and I don’t even think this class has that many buttons to press compared to most. I can’t even imagine playing a healer in my current state.

Do I need another modifier? I could use all of my mouse buttons as modifiers, but I feel like I would still misclick a lot.

Or is there an easier way to micro manage 30+ skills in this game? Should I be using macros of some sort instead of taking up so many hotbar slots?

I’m really having a hard time... and I’ve been playing MMOs for over 15 years. I never played WoW for longer than a couple months at a time though, and I never got to max level with a ton of skills to press. Even at lvl 50~ on WoW I started having a hard time managing button presses.",34,1583740127,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffr8as/should_i_macro/,ffxiv,1

I am a new player interested in playing FFXIV, and yesterday was my first time trying to start the game after successfully installing it through Steam and updating it without a problem. Unfortunately, I can't get the game to work whenever I have DirectX 11 Support enabled. The game window opens, but I'm quickly met with this error message that's in Japanese, which is strange since my client is English/NA. The message has a list of dxgi.dll files, and will close if I close the error message or click OK. The link below is a screen shot of the error message.

I found there was a wealth of information^(\[1\]) through the cumulative efforts of Reddit^(\[2\]) and the Discord^(\[3\]) communities, but found myself constantly swapping between tabs and resources to access said information.

So this project started out as a way to aggregate all the information for myself, to view, at a glance. From there it expanded into what I hope is a useful guide and reference.

For folk who are set on a specific task, you can find your route and choose what your specific objective is for that voyage (points, 5-star fish, white scrips, etc) via the landing page (seen in the post image).   


For example, here is the 5-Star Fish Guide for the Rhotano Sea Route (Night, Day, Sunset):

Meanwhile, more experienced anglers or those who'd like more substance presented to them at once can garner almost all pertinent information from the ""Fishing Flow Chart"". Here's an example of it:

ffneom,FireMouse56,I need help: I can't download FFXIV directly (not through steam) as my Square Enix account is linked to steam because I played the free trial on steam.,"Sorry for the long and unclear title but I don't know the best way to word it with just one sentance.

A few months back I tried FFXIV for the first time via the free trial on steam. I have now purchased the complete collection (for Windows), but I bought it directly from the Square Enix store rather than Steam (apparently it's not so good to buy it through Steam because it makes account related issues much holder to solve). I have the product activation key and everything, but when I downloaded the launcher and attempted to log in, it failed and says ""This service account does not have a valid FINAL FANTASY XIV license for this platform or your subscription has expired. To register a license, please visit the FINAL FANTASY XIV: Mog Station"".

Going to the Mog Station, it says that my account type is: Free Trial (Steam). From there I can click ""Upgrade to full version""

Here's a screenshot of what comes up when I click that.

![img](dmwng6ioyjl41)

I'd like to be able to transfer to Windows, but as you can see, Steam is selected and all other options are greyed out.

I then click ""Enter Registration Code"" at the bottom hoping I can enter my product activation code so it changes my account type 

On that page is a yellow box that reads "" For Steam Free Trial Account Users:  
\- A Steam registration code is required in order to upgrade to the full version of FINAL FANTASY XIV. Registration codes enclosed with the standard Windows version of FINAL FANTASY XIV cannot be applied to your account.  
\- Steam free trial accounts cannot be transferred to the PlayStation®4 or Mac versions of the game.""

This part appears to be the source of my issue and I'd like to know if there is a way to solve it. The only way I see to get passed this is just to buy it again but through steam, which I of course don't want to do. It says ""Registration codes enclosed with the standard Windows version of FINAL FANTASY XIV cannot be applied to your account."" but why not? And more important, is there a way I can change that? Or am I now forced to buy and play through Steam simply because I once played the free trial through Steam?

ffmyzd,DeepSleepr,"No tank swap after ""Change of Heart"" in Cinder Drift Ex 2nd phase??","just as the title says, aren't tanks suppose to swap side and provoke the other add if both are still alive?

Since I was short on 2 totems, though I do quick  Cinder Drift Ex farm. Our PF reaches 2nd phase and we get to 2 adds, blue &amp; red Nael. DPS wasn't big since both adds were still roughly around 15% HP, boss casts change of heart, and we all get swapped debuff. I run to the other side before the Change of Heart cast end and cast provoke on the new add. Suddenly my co-tank PLD starts typing all capslock on chat:

""DONT PROVOKE MY ADD YOU RETARD""

Wipe happens since 2 adds are tethered.  PLD begins rant about me tank swapping and blaming me for the wipe. Other members begin to question when was ""no tank swap"" a new pug strat, one by one people leaves party, and before PLD leaves he leaves a comment that it's all my fault.

Even if I don't swap adds, I won't be able to do any damage to add to hold aggro.  Am I suppose to use Provoke and hope I hold aggro with that before DPS/Healer steals aggro?",158,1583717633,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffmyzd/no_tank_swap_after_change_of_heart_in_cinder/,ffxiv,1

ffiyhq,Arizato,Friend can't access trial character after buying the complete edition,"Hello!  


I've been an avid player since the ARR launch and I suspect this might be some kind of mogstation error because several friends I've recruited to the game have had trouble things up for the right account and whatnot. But this takes the cake:  


A friend started playing the trial a week ago, had lots of fun in the game and decided to buy it today. So she got the complete edition, logged into the same mogstation account she used for the trial and got the full game. When I tried to invite her to my FC, send tells, etc the game told me she still is on the trial. So I told her to reboot and relog into the game for good measure. Still nothing. On the next step I visited her with my laptop and checked her account through her PC. She can still log in to the account on her computer, and play on her trial character. However, when we tried to log in to my laptop we can't find her character anywhere. I made sure we had the correct Data Center and World, yet there was nothing.   


Next, we tried to access Mog Station on that very same account. On both her PC and my laptop Mogstation says she has no characters.  


Yet when she logs in to her account on her PC it still give her access to her trial character. I made sure to even retype the account name and password without saving the account name to make sure she was using the same account.  


Mog station says she only has one service account. I've had other friends having an issue with accidentally setting up a second service account when they've registered their game, giving them several issues. But I can't find any trace of her trial account or her character on my laptop, nor mogstation.

ffbz62,StopFapForever,A few questions from a newbie,"Hi there. As I started yesterday the game, I have a few questions, thanks in advance to everyone for helping me.

1) I am at level 30 and I've done all the missions from my guild, but I'm still not able to become a Summoner.... what am I missing?

2) I just saw a guy wearing a ring with 30% exp bonus under lvl 50. I am lvl 30 and I would really like to get that.
I've checked in the open marker but seems to me there arent any on sale.
Do you know how can I get one?

3) I'm doing the lvl 20 missions from the main story but I still dont have the mount.
Is the mount mission a side mission that I have to activate in some way?

4) Blue magic... whats that? I see the option in the menu... are those skills you acquire for killin special mobs? Are any usefull?

5) I'm really really struggling with targeting enemies during a battle. I play with dualshock ps4 controller...
If I press the arrow it selects allies as well. If I press X it selects whatever is around.
I've tried to change a few options and commands but nothing works

There is any option to auto target the closest enemy? And after you have killed one just target or auto target the next closest one?

Thank you very much!",26,1583670995,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffbz62/a_few_questions_from_a_newbie/,ffxiv,1

ffbmuw,Wanzer-Reznaw,Would you prefer to see more varied Beast Tribes and Primal Fates or do you like the current status quo?,"Good Morning everyone!

Just as a question, since it's been sitting on my mind a lot lately.  Back in ARR and Heavensward, every Trial Fight baring Ultima/Nidhogg and Cape Westwind, was a different Beast Tribe's god, the Primals/Eikons or what have you.

In Stormblood we got 4 Primal Fights, Susanno, Lakshimi, Tsukiyomi and Shinryu, as of Shadowbringers we don't appear to be getting any Primal fights unless the plotline throws a curve ball at us.  By the looks of it, the ""Weapons""  are going to be Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald and ""Diamond""  based on the hair colors of the kids if the cutscene is anything to go off of. 

With the raid tiers we're reimagining/hashing the older primals but I wouldn't exactly call them ""primals"" anymore, but YMMV on that.

In my personal mindset, it makes no sense for the Eorzeans (the typical spoken) to be the only Pantheon driven group on the continent, so where are the other beast tribes that worship different gods or just other groups that worship different Gods as well?  I'd really love to see more summons or new creations come to life for the game.  Not to mention the expansion to the lore.  

Example:  Back during the ARR beast tribes, it was fairly obvious that the ""Blue"" Amal'jaa were a borderline monastic tradition focusing on self-improvement and martial prowess.  What were they're religious practices if any?   They had clear disdain for Ifrit after all. Could we see a sect of them split off and begin summoning their own deity?

Are Sahagan/Kojin the only seafaring beast tribes? (I will not count Namazu at the moment since they seem to only reside in waterways near major settlements).  Can we learn more about the Lupin and their culture and the possibilities of their own pantheons?  Lastly, do you all believe the Garleans have their own Beast Tribes up in their lands (aside from the Hrothegar), and if so, what do you think they are or look like and what could their worship practices be to and for?",18,1583668891,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffbmuw/would_you_prefer_to_see_more_varied_beast_tribes/,ffxiv,1

ffatzm,DarthDragon117,Should I basically start over with a new character?,"So some background info: I started just prior to ShB last year and made it to the end of Stomblood's initial story(ie killed battle hungry guy who fused with a primal). I got most of my jobs into the high 60's and a few low 70's. I played for a few months and stopped due to irl schedule and self restraint after realizing I was addicted(over a thousand hours over a few months). 

Yet I have been thinking about the game everyday and want to rejoin. However, I would like to experience the story and initial challenges again, especially since I have some knowledge of the FF universe now. Not to mention I thought it would be fun to write out a story/fanfic type thing based on my experience(with some alterations, obviously I would exclude stuff like replaying dungeons and irl chat).

I don't mind replaying content, as I find it refreshing in any game where I start over. It's like watching a movie a second or third time, you notice new things, you understand it more, you pick up on foreshadowing etc. Besides, I haven't played since early Fall of last year, I'm sure some things have changed. Finally, and I know there are potions to change this, but when I started I was on the demo with limited customization and couldn't bare to change my toon when I upgraded.

So tldr: Should I start a new toon and relive the glorious journey or drop feet first into my now almost foreign albeit advanced character?

ffardo,level99cynic,About Amaurot (ShB Spoilers),"Just completed the 5.0 MSQ. Great story, but a bit confused about why Emet-Selch couldn’t just save Amaurot himself back in the “Final Days”?

I ask because the level 80 dungeon “Amaurot” is supposed to be a recreation of the doomsday events faced by the Ascians, right? The idea was that if we could prevail in this dungeon, we would have bested the doomsday event. But when we do prevail, Emet-Selch says we were still not good enough because if he were to use his full powers, we would be no match. Surely this means that by extension, his full powers would have been enough to beat back the doomsday events of Amaurot himself.

Am I missing something here? Did the story suggest somewhere that the monsters in the dungeon were not as strong as the actual monsters that appeared in the Final Days? Or did Emet-Selch maybe get way stronger since then?",16,1583662824,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ffardo/about_amaurot_shb_spoilers/,ffxiv,1

ff9jy7,jWILL253,Two Story Concerns [SPOILERS],"[Pre-5.0 spoilers, you've been warned]

***1. Was the attempted assassination of Nanamo Ul Namo ever addressed before we traveled to The First?***

I ask because when I went into an inn room, I decided to watch some old cutscenes. One of the ones I decided to watch was the framing of the Scions for regicide against the Sultanate. And, if my memory is correct... this whole thing kinda went nowhere. Sure, it served as a great lead-in for Heavensward by making us refugees on the lam, but the actual treason committed by the Monetarists has seen to have gone unpunished. And that would be one thing if Nanamo actually had died. But... she didn't. And she knows it was a ruse by the Monetarists to gain power in addition to keeping her from abolishing the monarchy like she was planning to do that very night. And yet, seems like the Monetarists are better off now than they were prior, now that Lolorito is profiting off of Ala Mhigan labor.

***2. I don't think Varis was being mind controlled at the parley, like some had suggested.***

This is my favorite scene in the game just due to how insane it is. Just goes off the rails at a coin flip. But I've heard people speculate that Varis wasn't donning the clown makeup by choice, and he was being be bodysnatched/mind controlled by Elmet-Selch or Elidibus. 

But one of the other scenes I watched was Cutscene 3 of ""Prelude in Violet"", where - after ES reminds Varis is his place as nothing more than an enforcer made to carry out whatever the Ascians want to do - Varis shoots him, and says that man controls his own destiny. Then ES pops back up in a new body, and proceeds to remind Varis that their goals are essentially the same: to restore mankind to its rightful place. And during the parley, Varis not only passively acknowledges that his goals are essentially the same as the Ascians, but also reveals to the EA that Garlemald was founded by an Ascian. Then he suggests that the only way the Ascians can be defeated is if mankind were back in its ""perfect"" state. So, we can safely assume the Ascians &amp; Garleans have the same means to the same ends, but different motives. 

Varis was in his right mind, and the ""disturbance"" people referenced with the lights flickering seems to be nothing more than a display of cinematography that sets an uneasy, tense stage for the wild shit Varis was about to say. Personally, I think people were so caught off guard by Varis using seemingly logical reasoning in the first half of the parley (even though his reasoning is really just ""WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY"" and no one thought to leave the Pirate Queen out of the emperor-bashing party), then pulling out his swastika arm band in the second half.",36,1583654357,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ff9jy7/two_story_concerns_spoilers/,ffxiv,1
ff9fd4,Athcear,Speculation for 5.2 trailer scenes that we haven't yet gotten (Spoilers for 5.2 thus far),"Reviewing the 5.2 trailer, we see a lot of stuff about Ruby, Eden, and the MSQ quests including ""Ardbert"", Gaius, the new dungeon, Zenos, and the star shower. There's nods to the beast tribe quests and ocean fishing. And then there's two things we haven't seen yet. One is the bazooka wielding person, which Yoshida said in the last live letter is from the new Diadem, and we'll see it soon once the new Ishgard restoration elements come out soon.

The rest, we must speculate, comes from the new Citadel, and the upcoming relic weapon quests. This is where we see Cid and his Au Ra friend, and we're attacking a Garlean compound... and then the Scions arrive. So, let's us speculate. Are we going to get some more MSQ quests in 5.25 to bring the Scions home? Lots of 5.2 involved wrapping them up and saying goodbyes. They're still in their First clothes and appearances (Thancred's eye appears to be fine and he's clean shaven), suggesting that maybe they're not back in their bodies? Is this perhaps a diversion and the Scions are avatars from the Trust system? Is Cid coming to the First somehow? If the Scions do indeed return to the Source in this content, will they simply seem to vanish for someone who doesn't play it when they get to 5.3?

For myself, I think 5.25 will involve new MSQ, and it will bring the Scions back to the Source. I think it will be quick and will introduce the Citadel, but the Citadel itself will be side content. I think the template was laid out with the first quest of 5.2, where we were introduced to Ruby Weapon, and then sent on our way.

Any possible help would be appreciated. I'm not sure if this is a GM issue or not?? I thought I would ask here to see if you guys can see if I'm doing anything wrong before possibly contacting them. If they can even do anything that is.

ff63zk,Kabooa,Primals Speculation,"Apologies if this has been done before - search results didn't really show anything tackling this exact thing.

So while in another thread, I started typing out this wall about what I thought a thing was, namely the true name of an Ascian.  As far as I know, we've only the one.  Hades, holding the office of Emet Selch.

While we cannot really extrapolate more true names from just the one, I say we don't let that stop us.  So hear me out.  Here's the claim.

Primals as we know them on the Source are the Ancients recreated through mass communal Creation Magic.  Though we think of them as Beastman gods, not all of them fall within the Beastman themselves.

With 5.2 we have learned a thing - The ""Echo"" is just the soul of a sundered Ancient being awakened.

We also know that with SuperEcho, Zenois capable of taking over other beings.  In other words, he replaces their will with his own.

You know.  Like Primals do when they temper people.  The greater being taking over the will of a lesser.

It might seem kind of out of place to call Shinryu a 'lesser being', but I'd argue there's no reason to believe an Ancient couldn't create something similar.  There's several ways we can justify this, but all of them are speculation, so I ask that you, for the sake of this argument, accept that Zenos Resonant &gt; Shinryu.

It also explains why the Echo offers resistance - It effectively puts you on the same field of existence.  Awakened Ancient vs Summoned Ancient.

Further, we know that the Ancients stored ""Concepts"", for them to review when using Creation magic.  While I have no way to prove this, when the ship and Dragon Daddy crashed into the big ole Lake and ""released"" the primals, could that not have been due to a long undiscovered Concept storage being broken open?  What if the ""Concept"" that was stored were the Ancients who sacrificed themselves to Zodiark, and would serve as the template for the promised resurrection?

""Let us cast aside false pretense and titles, and reveal our true faces to one another!""

*Becomes an FF Summon*

Speculation of the true names of the Ascian Office holders is kind of hard to do without a second one, but I don't think Hades was chosen lightly, nor just to serve as fan service.

In the FF Verse, Summons are generally larger than life, ranging anywhere from natural magic beings to worshiped gods that stand above the rest of the inhabitants.",24,1583635181,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ff63zk/primals_speculation/,ffxiv,1

ff5ibm,HisShadowX,Is the Mentor program discouraging people from tanking?,"So I’ve been playing since 2013. I come back every couple of years well this year I remade a character and leveled a DPS and tank to 80 since 01/01/2020.

What I noticed as a tank during my lower levels the DPS players who queued to leveling did not want to get treasure or do the entire dungeon to level.

I also noticed even though I was at max gear at the time during the 30s, 40s it gets weird with tank gear during these levels and DPS users who literally examine everyone and act as sort of a backseat driver would literally try to boss around the entire group.

During my runs I noticed I got some good advice but there were way to many not giving advice but causing issue after issue when there was none.

I would be in leveling parties were we wiped 4 times because no one knew what they were doing or someone messed up but no one would say anything.

But get a DPS backseat driver mentor into the group even if you don’t wipe they will try to tell everyone what to do and demean them for a while. 

I’ve seen tanks and sometimes healers literally quit because it became to much.

There needs to be a report function for these DPS backseat drivers who are not helping but coming into the group and causing a flame war sometimes or problems where there are none.

If we haven’t wiped and we have a DPS mentor typing in all caps like a Marine Corps Drill Instructor all it’s doing is demoralizing the party.",44,1583632412,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ff5ibm/is_the_mentor_program_discouraging_people_from/,ffxiv,1

So this thought just crossed me this morning, How come that Gaius didn't keep the Ultima weapon in Gyr Abania? It feels like that would had been a much more secure area for such a important weapon for the empires plan.

Now, as i am writing this, i haven't done much of research due to simply just wanting to go to bed as soon as possible so sorry if i miss some details but the only reason story wise is that Gais was confident that nobody could have breached the praetoriums defenses and simply didn't feel threatened but still.

fexb1i,Eldiablo_90,The fastest way to do the last 4 groups in Anamnesis Anyder,"Hey, so me and my friends farmed some items / tombstones and run Anyder a few times and wanted to test something:  


We found out, that the fastest way to do the last 4 groups is as follow: After the second Boss, hit the frist group but ignore them. Run down the ramp, ignoring the chest and kill the two sahagin that would summon from the crystalls with focus dmg. Normally, you would have killed those two without spawning an extra group. If one of the players is running towards the chest, you invest to much time cause they start summon as soon as you reach the bottom of the ramp. After you killed the two sahagin that will summon, run straight to the next group /still having the first group without summoners on your tanks ass) and bomb all of them away. After that, regroup and start together attackign the last group, focusing one after another in order to stop all 3 of them to summon.  


A tip for random groups:

You cant really do that, but... let your tank engage the last groups how he sees. If he ignores the last group, he has a plan. He wants to focus them one after another. You can easily stop 2 of the 3 from summon that giant beasts which have so much HP, its more time consuming bombing than away, than hinder the summoning in the first place.  
If only one player is racing towards the last group and triggers the summoning, you have made the run longer than wating for a group engage. You want to speed up things and pull for your tank? Thats one thing, but its funny how often i see other DDs or heals increasing the time of the run, cause they think its faster to aoe bomb those 2, if not 3 behemoths that will spawn.",22,1583598012,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fexb1i/the_fastest_way_to_do_the_last_4_groups_in/,ffxiv,1

fewd1a,Sines314,Personal Opnions on AST vs. SCH?,"So, did Scholar during last raid tier, and decided to try out Astrologian this tier. However, while I started to like it more as I got hang of Sleeve Draw, once I spent some time against Ramuh, I started missing some parts of Scholar. Most notably during Chain Lightning, where Seraph sitting in the middle to help out everyone would be great, while I dropped Excog and Aetherbond on the tanks so that I could basically ignore healing. I kinda don't feel like there's any time where I'd really miss an aspect of Astrologians kits for the fight. About the only exception is Nocturnal Benefic + ED+CI for panic heals.

However, I also haven't felt there's a hugely great time for Neutral Sect in this fight, and that's the one really big thing I'd miss.

At any rate, I was thinking about switching back to Scholar, but wanted to hear what it was people like about Astrologian.

I have come to realize that who ever stole my account actually did not sell any of my items or send any of my money at all. I contacted square enix support in hopes I could cancel the rollback before its to late as quite a bit of time would be lost, however it has already gone up the chain and to a completely different department.

My question to anyone who has had to utilize the character rollback function before is: Do they send out a final confirmation before hitting the ""rewind button"" where I could decline and cancel the rollback all together?

feoz1a,roxieh,"Hello, I have a very specific healing question. [No Spoilers]","I'm a fresh level 80 WHM - hello! I play on a controller hooked up to my pc or laptop.

I've been trying to practise using Rescue. I used not to even have it on my bar (lol), since I now understand its usefulness I've been reminding myself to look for opportunities to use is and get it on my muscle memory, which has been pretty successful so far. 

However for the first time I am experiencing a skill block between controller and KBM. 

For KBM users, if someone is out of position you can simply click on them and tap the key bind for Rescue. 

For controller users it is... Not that simple, in my experience. There's no way to select an ally who's, say, far away from the group easily (to my knowledge). In order to perform a successful Rescue I have to notice someone needs rescuing, identify which player it is - normally by their username and this is always unique - then I have to find their username in the party list, then I have to mash up/down on the D-pad to select them and then I have to muscle-memory rescue. This takes seconds and they are usually dead by the time I could complete it. In contrast, KBM users can do the same thing in two actions. 

Am I doing it wrong? Or is it really this unintuitive on a controller, and should I learn KBM to compensate as I wish to be a top tier healer?

I tried just about every in game setting, inspected my computers hardware, monitored cpu, ram, and GPU usage and everything was functioning perfectly. I discovered tonight however, that limiting my FPS to 30 solved all frame rate issues. It’s not ideal but the game is stable now and in a playable state.

Just thought I would share Incase anyone else out there is going through the stressful motions of trying to fix this problem and hope this helps.

fems9v,Pandalishus,“Defense” has me nervous about tanking,"Returned to the game after leaving mid-HW. Decided to boost a PLD and really enjoyed leveling to 80. Got a pretty decent feel for the rotation, got familiar enough the the PS4 controller to not derp too much, ran all of the relevant dungeons in Trust “mode,” bought some Neo-Ishgardian gear, unlocked CF... then rolled DNC. After a few moments of wondering why I boosted a tank only to chicken out right before really jumping in, I realized it’s because I don’t have a solid handle on defense. More to the point, I’m not at all sure of what my job is relative to the healer. 

Before quitting FF14, I was a full-time healer, but I always had tanks who knew what to do (or I assumed they did), so I just made sure I was a solid healer and it worked out (played at a pretty high level, in fact). Now, I realize I’m NOT a tank who knows what to do defensively, and I’m concerned about stressing the healers and/or wiping the raid. So, a few questions:

-Tank busters aside, am I supposed to be rotating defensive CD’s, or are they there to be used for said tank busters (or when it all falls apart) and otherwise left alone?

-Am I sufficiently tanky at the appropriate gearscore that if I respond to mechanics correctly and not losing aggro, I’m “doing it right?”

-I liked healing for quick queues and not having to be the leader. I traded the stress of keeping everyone for the “boon” of just being to follow along. As a tank, I’ve traded, haven’t I? Now I need to know the fight pretty well, but my “job” is less stressful (take big hits, don’t die)?

-Are people still pretty forgiving if I announce that I’m a new tank in chat?

-Other advice you might see fit to give.

I’d love to transition from being a reliable healer to a reliable tank, but I’ll be damned if it’s not (unnecessarily?) daunting.",9,1583539330,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fems9v/defense_has_me_nervous_about_tanking/,ffxiv,1

felqij,Lycharz,Need help for Yukkuri TTS announce me twice my cooldowns," Hi !  

Having installed ""ACTSpelltimer"" and ""TTS Yukkuri"" I encountered a problem.  I made sure that Yukkuri announces me when one of my personal cooldowns returns (Example: Embolden, Acceleration, Manification etc ...) 

 When I am out of combat she announces me well in TTS the recovery of my cooldown.  On the other hand, in combat she announces me all TTS 2 times. 

 I looked a little in the various options of ACT but I can't find anything referring to that.  Could someone tell me how to make sure that even when I'm in combat she announces the TTS only once and not twice?  

Also, I also noticed that on the spelltimer the cooldowns also appear in duplicate, one with the mention ""none"" and the other with the mention ""you"" while I when I am not in combat, the cooldown do not appear in duplicate  I show you the screens of my configuration. 

 Hope someone can help me :)",0,1583534838,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/felqij/need_help_for_yukkuri_tts_announce_me_twice_my/,ffxiv,1

felmjr,KodiakMoonwolf,Ruby Weapon fight plot hole? (also spoilers if you've not done the fight yet!),"(Ok so first off sorry in advance if i've done this wrong, my first proper reddit post!)

Ok so got what I think is a little in lore plot hole here and it's one that's just started bugging me and I needed to at least ask someone about it, figured it might make a little discussion!

So in the Ruby weapon fight it's got the attack Optimized Ultima, which as the weapon project talks about, is obviously based on the data gathered from Ultima weapon..but as far as I can remember from the fights with Ultima...Gaius didn't know that the weapon contained the power of the ultimate magic in the heart of Sabik...of Ultima...

So consider the Praetorium was basically vaporised, my question is this...how do the Garlean's know and have data on Ultima? 

Yes I'm probably overthinking it (I do that.) but I figured it might be interesting to see if anyone has an answer/theory...or as my friend is always reminding me as part of the MST3K mantra 'then just repeat to yourself, it's just a ~~show~~ game, i should really just relax!'",19,1583534375,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/felmjr/ruby_weapon_fight_plot_hole_also_spoilers_if/,ffxiv,1

feidvj,unlimitedblack,FF3 Connections with Heaven-on-High,"Quest: On the Shoulders of Giants

* The Onishishu Master's appearance and coloration match with Luneth's default palette in FF3DS. 
   * Additionally, he specifically mentions Princess Salina and Desch, whom we know are linked with Princess Sara and Desch from FF3. 
* The Master states that his friends gave their lives to spare the world Allag's fate. We know that Allag was destroyed by the Fourth Umbral Calamity (the Earth Calamity) and that is what removed the Crystal Tower from the surface of the world. 
   * We also know that Salina and Desch survived that calamity, since it was AFTERWARDS that Salina transferred the Royal Eye to Desch so that he could pass it on to his descendants, leading ultimately to G'raha Tia. 

Contextual details: 

* The legends associated with the tower (which admittedly were fabricated by the Onishishu to protect the tower) discuss the notion of it supporting a heavenly location from which the gods descend. This could be an interpretation of the Floating Continent from FF3, and the Tower of Owen (which Desch was the guardian of) that supported it. 

Bosses: 

* A few floor bosses in Heaven-on-High re-use models from the Crystal Tower raids, which in turn are inspired by the art of bosses from FF3.
   * Kenko is Cerberus
   * Suikazura is Scylla
   * Onra is Xande

Questions: 

* On the presumption that the Onishishu Master IS Luneth, what happened to Arc, Refia and Ingus? 
* When the Master references the sacrifice of his friends, is he referencing the deaths of Salina and Desch? 
* The Master stated that his friends gave their lives to prevent the world from suffering Allag's fate, and looks to the sky while mentioning Salina and Desch. This could be interpreted to mean that Luneth and his crew aided Salina and Desch in doing something to prevent another calamity, and that he founded the Onishishu and took over Heaven-on-High to ensure that there would always be heroes who would be around to do the same.

I opened up my computer and cleaned out dust, my fans are working everything seems to be fine. I updated my drivers because i was missing an update. That didn't fix it.

fe782m,Diego2112Gaming,"So Had a Thought About Iceheart [spoilers for Heavensward MSQ, mention of DRK questline NPCs]","I think I flaired it right? Not sure. Anyway...

OK, so we all know who Ysayle is, and we (hopefully) all love her (I know I do). We all know who the original Shiva was, and what she did as regards to Hraesvelgr.

Consider: Midgarsormr strips you of the so-called Blessing of Light. You spend most of Heavensward trying to get it back. It's only after Ysayle's sacrifice the connection is completed again, and, oh, what's this? Suddenly the crystal grid has what looks like the overlay of a snowflake on it! What's more, certain sidequests dragons will comment how you ""Smell like Ysayle.""

Why does this matter? 

Simple: Shiva sacrificed herself to Hraesvelgr for peace, essentially merging her essence with his. He continually comments on her ""Soothing presence"" throughout your dealings with him. Ysayle sacrifices herself to save the Warrior of Light, and it's my belief that some of her aether merged with theirs at that point (this is further supported by the Anima questline--which starts with you going through Snowcloak in the dungeon phase, and the weapon is created at Helix, near where she died--but that's neither here nor there--that's a whole 'nother topic, really), helping reestablish the WoL's connection with Hydaelyn, and helping bring about the peace she so desired.

Ysayle is to the Warrior of Light as Shiva is to Hraesvelgr. 

Now, is any of this confirmed? NOPE! It's all speculation on my part, in no small part due to my absolute adoration of Ysayle, and the fact that I wept nigh inconsolably when... anyway. Point is, it's another angle to come at it from, one that I'd not seen explored, and one that hit me like a sack of bricks last night while I was talking with my wife about a screenshot involving a certain character in the DRK questline that... well, from a distance, seeing them, you can't help but think of her.

Consider this one person's headcanon that you can take and run with, if you, like me, are a fan of Ysayle. If you're not, eh, well, no harm no foul.",33,1583464288,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fe782m/so_had_a_thought_about_iceheart_spoilers_for/,ffxiv,1

fe6inh,TheWanderingWitch,PSA: GM Item Restoration doesn't work if the item dropped to the floor from your inventory being full.,"Context:

Cleared E6S with my static tonight, then got the tomestone and head piece assigned to me for loot. Unfortunately, I forgot that I had both done an expert this morning and hadn't had time to clean out my inventory (I had 2 slots left),  and I forgot that clearing gives you a token which takes up inventory space.   As a result, after I finished rolling on my assigned loot, I got the headpiece and the tomestone hit the ground to everyone's panic and dismay.  

Naturally, I did the thing that anyone who still have an item restoration attempt would try to do after panicking.  Contact SE, and ask if they can restore the item, giving screenshots, logs, and so forth.   However to my dismay... I received the following response:

https://imgur.com/a/rxJPpeD

...So yeah.  That's going to sting for prog for a bit.  

Tl;dr:  SE won't restore items if they drop to the ground from your inventory being full.  Also make sure you sell whatever shit you get from Expert before you go into raid.  (And please petition for an inventory space notification before you roll on loot.)",9,1583461058,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fe6inh/psa_gm_item_restoration_doesnt_work_if_the_item/,ffxiv,1

fe4v74,CursedFloofe,Playing on EU datacenter as NA player-- Crafting and Latency questions,"Hi all, I've been considering swapping over to an EU datacenter (Chaos, to be specific,) from the Crystal datacenter (NA.) I made an alt and haven't noticed any latency at all in the open world, but was wanting to hear from others about latency-- would I be able to comfortably heal Normal Edens? Shinryu? Or would I need to stick to dps. Also, crafting. I'm an end game crafter with spiffy macros and am a bit worried if there is latency that might alter them-- in teamcraft I recall seeing and being able to add lag countermeasures through extra wait time between actions, but was hoping to hear from folks in similar situations, if possible. Anyhow, advice, opinions, and stories are appreciated. PS-- I searched for NA/EU questions and mainly found posts on EU folks playing on NA datacenters. I imagine it would be similar but just wanted to hear first hand on this reverse.

I also looked at all the classes and fell in love with Samurai aesthetically and it being able to dish out a lot of damage but then the wait time was super long. I then decided to test other characters and landed on what I wanna main... Dark KNIGHT! Oh boy this class looks great and the view on tanking made me realize how fun it is to lead your party into battle! Also the job story line is quite interesting so I won't spoil anything.

In WoW and SWTOR every class has multiple talent trees. For an example priest can be played both offensively and as healer. 

And here comes my problem. I fell in love with White Mage VFX but for the love of Narnia I can't find any post or video about it being used as damage dealer in dungeons and raids. Is it support only class? I know it's not melee but it is so beautiful.

fe2hgt,TotallyABrobot,How's my big explanation of all of the combat Jobs in FFXIV so far?," (note: I was explaining it to a FFVII fan)

Paladin - Holy boi, sword and shield. Lob your shield, and can heal  itself or a party member, attack a single enemy or a group of enemies  around you.

Warrior - Two Words: FELL CLEAVES. Big ass axe. It's basically able to not die. But it's somehow worse than Paladin. 

Dark Knight - EDGELORD ACHIEVED! Combine MUH DARKNESS and a big  fucking sword, there's nothing you can't brood and sulk to death. Perks  include: losing your soul and punching moogles. Also has an amazing  questline.

Gunbreaker - Do you like Gunblades, Squall Leonheart or Lightning?  Yeah, it's that, but a tank. Best Tank DPS by far. Has the flashiest  melee attack combos. With explosions and spinning, you look dope.

White Mage - basically the best healer, it has big heals, and big  damage (compared to the other two healers), and their AoE can stun foes.  And then there's Misery, a big fuck off button that at item level 465  can crit for ohhhhh, just about 70,000 damage. As a healer. Oh, and best  heals over time, in my opinion, with Regen and Medica II (MII is an AoE  HoT, at that). White Mage just...doesn't stop delivering.

Scholar - You are a fairy slaver, don't deny it. I know this one the  least, but it just...no u's damage. Prevention is sometimes better than  healing. It has a fuck off fairy that lets you DPS more by doing your  job for you. My least favorite healer.

Astrologian - I hope you're ready to d-d-d-d-duel. You best believe  in the heart of the cards to buff you party with MORE DPS oh yeah. And  it can switch between healing over time and preventing damage, on top of  those DPS buffs. Still salty they axed card diversity but ehh, better  than no cards.

Monk - you're Goku. You punch things fast and have a jumping  Kamehameha! fuck off beam. A class I barely know shit about, unlike  Scholar.

Dragoon - Hey, you're Cid from FFVII, but with an infinite +DPS mode.  And more Jumps. And a fiery explosion. Chain your Blue Form with your  single target attacks and Jump for a big fuck off AoE attack that can  turn you into a rage-y red form for an extra jump and 3 AoE attacks over  30 seconds. My favorite Melee DPS.

Ninja - what are you, Naruto? You big fuckin' weeb. You can Naruto  run and it has combination attacks, where if you put in 2 skills, you  get a different attack/ability. If you fail that, you get a cute bunny  thing on your head. Can't start the game as this, unfortunately. You  gotta get to Lv10 and do your Lv10 class quest and go to the Rogue guild  to unlock it. Oh, and you dual wield daggers, because you're a fuckin'  weeb.

Samurai - basically mobile, melee Black Mage. You have the damage to  back up you being a selfish asshole and no one can tell you otherwise.  The other weeb DPS. You just gotta chain together three sign thingies  then you can do a big fuck off attack. It's fun, imo. And you, of  course, use Katanas.

Bard can buff the party, and back in 2.0 was basically a mage. Now  the attacks are all bow and arrow related. Always use Peloton because  move fast.

Machinist uses guns and robots to hit shit hard. Coffee button is a flamethrower AoE. Unlike Bard, it's simple.

Dancer uses dual ring blade things called Chakrams. You hit a button,  and your single target attacks turn into colors, basically and you hit  them if they light up and if you don't suck you do a lot of damage, buff  the parties damage, among a few other things I don't know about yet. It  can partner up with a party member, and every buff and skill you use  that affects the party around you is also done around them. It's got a  shield skill (like Scholar's damage reduction), I think. It also has a  heal skill, which is an AoE on you.

Black Mage - EXPUROSION! Seriously, that's all you do until you run  out of MP, then you become a laughing sto...I mean, an Ice Mage. You  swap between flinging Fire and slinging Ice, basically. But you wanna  use Fire IV because it's a big fuck off EXPUROSION button.

Summoner - so you fight elemental gods, called Primals and when you  beat them, you get a smaller version of them to assist you. The 3 basics  are Ifrit, Titan and Garuda. Ifrit is for single targets, Titan is  useless now since Summoner pets can't be targeted but it's the tank of  the three, and Garuda is an AoE spell caster. After awhile, you can  summon Bahamut, and after that, you can summon Phoenix who basically  ????'s you. I don't know about Phoenix but it's pretty to look at. And  Bahamut has Megaflare, spammable. So yeah, that's a thing.

Red Mage - twice the magic for twice the fun! Some of the spells have  long cast times, so you just cast a shorter cast first. After that,  instantly, be it a revive, a heal, or a big DPS spell, you cast it. Dual  Cast is broken, basically. You can heal, revive and do good damage, and  it all goes off of your main stat, Intelligence, so healing won't be  like, 7 HP healed. My favorite caster.

Blue Mage - basically the Enemy Skill Materia, but as a Job. You  can't bring them into every duty, dungeon, trial or raid, but it's the  meme job because you can kill yourself. And teleport spam.",29,1583443844,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fe2hgt/hows_my_big_explanation_of_all_of_the_combat_jobs/,ffxiv,1

I fear the Reaper’s forespoken wrath

Taught to fear the Reaper (fragile creature)

Fear the Reaper I’ll find no peace

Voices tell me to let it go and I

Locked in the ice

Cast aside endless lying

Steeling my soul

Fearless and cold

I will learn how to fight Her

Again and again and again and again and a-

fdzjb8,Iulianos_Valentinus,Constant DC (90002),"Hey guys,

I've recently started playing FFXIV (few weeks back) and fallen in love with it. Maybe a bit too much, seeing as I'm already in Shadowbringers :') The game's absolutely great!

I've seen a few 90002s (90Ks from now) before, maybe 1 every 3/4 days if I was unlucky. But recently, the frequency increased. It began when I started 4.5, but was doable. However, it became significantly worse with the start of Shadowbringers, to the point where I've had at least 2/3 DCs per hour. Today it became unbearable, with 5 90ks in less than 25 minutes while doing a leveling dungeon.

Now, I'm not here to ask you for technical solutions or anything, because if I want those I should go to the Technical Support of SE. No, the reason I made this thread was to ask if anyone else has had these issues, specifically starting around the end of SB.

Reason why I'm asking? Curiosity. Even if half of you were to have the same, it'd mean nothing to SE, but it would give me some ease of mind knowing I'm not the only one :)

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: has anyone else started seeing more 90ks since the end of SB/ start of Shadowbringers?",0,1583432605,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdzjb8/constant_dc_90002/,ffxiv,1

fdzeby,Papaya_Dreaming,My ingame marriage is on the rocks because I neglected to heal my husband on unsynced Rathalos extreme,"We had a long conversation today with our characters seated at the Quicksand in Ul'dah. He is extremely unhappy with my behavior--already knew that, becaus he is often given to histrionic moments of ""where has my little heal slut gone"" or ""I wish you healed me more."" These tidbits pop up completely out of the blue, but i cannot help but exacerbate the situation because I've found an addiction solidly stronger than love itself. When he opened a trade window and ""attempted"" to trade his ceremonial ring back to me, I knew that my problem had grown into a monster I wasn't going to stop myself. I needed to seek help. And this is my first step--coming clean... the confessions of a DPS healer. 

Every time I waste a cast on a GCD healing spell, for those 2.4 or so seconds, I feel like complete garbage. Like I should not exist. I now see myself as a DPS with faster queue times. Every single fight I've done in progression raiding, I add dissipating my fairy into the rotation--like an addict squeezing a few more drops of delight out of the cap, I literally slobber over the opportunity to throw out three more energy drains. By Selene, youre just a thot in the way of my 450 potency. Using them on lustrates or indoms is the equivalent of taking a vibrant green puppy and tossing it into a dumpster. In dungeons, I make sure to right click an enemy to get auto attacks in between the art of war casts. I can't remember the last time I hadn't set my swift cast to broil. 

At first, my husband tried to force me off my mindset by sending my reddit links and forum articles, where the ""healers heal"" mentality is on full display. 

Those only exacerbated my situation. I laid awake at night imagining *never* hitting a damage spell in dungeons. What a frightening life. It is not for me. 

I think the day he really started to give up on me was when we got into an E3N. After finishing the fight, I had let out a joyful shriek: I had hit a 1 percentile healing parse and we survived the fight. My one heal was a lustrate on myself because moving out of the AoE would have lost me a broil. 

Then, things came to a head because my husband wanted me to be his little heal laborer in an unsynced trial, to farm the mount. We had one friend with us to supplement DPS...

Our friend mounted the Rathalos in the phase where the big old elephant creature comes our, while we tried our best to deal with the hulking, angry DPS check. Of course, I felt a wave of arousal hit me at this opportunity to deploy everything in my arsenal! Meanwhile, and ""allegedly,"" my husband was at half health for six full seconds before the elephant attacked. And it killed him. 

Despite us successfully completing the trial, my dejected partner left our group call and said he would like to take a break. 

I agree, and try to head out to my favorite spot to do my three hours of Scholar DPS practice, the training dummies at Falcon Reach. While I'm there... I see someone. It's the person I paid real life to marry and share a mount with. Now on a different mount, the Rathalos... flanked by an astrologian. 

I couldn't believe it. I finished my DPS rotation and asked what the hell was happening. My husband, caught in the act, just said he found himself a new pocket healer..  an ASTRO. A class built around giving other classes damage? How subservient can one person get?!

And that's when he told me to stop throwing a tantrum in our FC chat and to meet him in Ul'Dah. Hearing my actions explained back to me, it put a seed of doubt in me that these minute-faster clears were not worth this marital anguish. Seeing him there, hurt and confused by my behavior, it made me realize my pursuit of damage had led me to causing the highest damage of all: harm to my beloved. 

We tried Ratahlos extreme again, and beside biolysis, I only spammed succor and adlo in the first phase. His health never went below 80%, despite him getting smacked by every single tackle. When the elephant came, I just sat there and spammed six separate lustrates on him the second the agro line appeared. He was so happy. 

Afterward, I went to my bathroom and puked, then passed out in the puke for four hours. Damage withdrawals. 

Alas, here I am. Stuck between my symptoms, and the need to change. Lo, is there any recourse for a freak like me? Perhaps I should retire for good, just go to begging for commendations in Guildhests... it would be well-deserved to take this rabid hrothgar out back. 

Unless one of you can help. Though I doubt it will do much, any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please save my relationship and 14 healer career.

fdyqa4,Giraffesaretoocute,DPS classes,"Hello!

I have recently gotten into FF, and I have mainly been healing. Now I have decided to branch out and try dps. I have looked around for some dps guides, to see which one would really fit my playstyle and it seems like none of them have been updated for Shadowbringers.

I took a look at FF logs ([https://www.fflogs.com/zone/statistics/29/#aggregate=amount](https://www.fflogs.com/zone/statistics/29/#aggregate=amount)) to see which does the most damage, and it looks like SMN. I tried leveling that, but my goodness the pet abilities just make the class so clunky and awkward. 

I was looking into BLM because I heard it was a dps god, but again, according to FF logs ninja even does more damage than it haha. Does not really seem worth it to not have any support abilities if I am not going to back it up with that big dick dps.

I just don't want something that is boring, or too easy to play. I am up for a challenge, maybe something that is easy to learn but difficult to master. I would like something that is okay to quest on, preferably a class that does not take a while to ramp up their damage, like monk, although if monk is okay for questing I might just have to pick that (even though a bad tank seems to turn me off of the class completely x\_x)

Any info on the damage classes at 80 is appreciated, I am really just looking for some insight! Thanks!",16,1583429511,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdyqa4/dps_classes/,ffxiv,1

As in all 14 parts rejoined back into one being. What would that be like? What would happen? And more importantly:

Would we suddenly get one of those masks that adorn Emet-Selch, Elidibus, Lahabrea and the rest? The one that appears and disappears on command. And if so I would love it if it was blue instead of red as a change of pace and interesting detail.

And when it happens, do we suddenly gain all of our memories as an Amourotian? (Amourite?)

And if we regain our memories do we suddenly change personality? Or do we just figure out what happened all those eons ago?

Would there be distrust in the group? They've been effectively working with an Ascian sleeper agent. If at all. It's been strongly suggested that the WoL was the 14 member of the congregation that governed Amourot but is also a defector. Why did they defect? I'm assuming they disagreed with the summoning of Zodiark.

Again this might never happen and most likely won't but I would love it if it did as it would be an interesting development.",25,1583428419,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdyg9b/what_i_would_like_to_see_albeit_unlikely_and_very/,ffxiv,1

fdv1dl,DynamiteGazelle,Account creation is a mess.,"I have been trying to create an account for 3 days now. 

I attempted to create an account, but when i entered the code I was given for confirmation, there was an error that said ""you cannot use this function"" and sent me back to the first account creation page. So I tried to start the process over and was told ""an email has already been sent"". However, there is no way to enter my confirmation code again because getting to the confirmation page requires getting past the first create account page, which I cannot do because I already used my email.  
I then tried to login but it said my username/password was incorrect. So, I tried to reset my password thinking maybe my account had somehow been created. I received the email for password reset, but there was no confirmation code in the email. Just a link to the normal login page.  
You can only get these emails once every 24 hours so I had to wait a whole day to start the process over. The next time I tried the same exact thing happened!  


I just want to try out this game. It looks fun, but man their system just seems so archaic. I mean, I it's not my first rodeo lol, I've made accounts before.

fdspbc,_LadyOfWar_,"Applying the o11s ""Hands Strat"" to e6s's Conflag Enumerations--Giving the DPS an Easy Way to Adjust","A lot of PFs do not really have a decisive strategy for this mechanic outside of ""try to stand with your tether partner in an area different than  the other DPS"".  Let's face it, seeing those DPS tethers during the conflag phase is a real pain, people assume wrong, and 4 DPS constatly struggle to spread their 2 circles and get exactly 2 DPS in each without overlapping and killing a healer, a tank, or themselves.

In reality, we can use the same strategy in o11s to simplify the process; PFs already use a simpler version that ""anchors"" one DPS to a specific ""area""  (west or east assuming the MTQ cardinal spread).  Assign the 4 DPS in your group as follows:

DPS #1 is ALWAYS west.  He/she NEVER moves from this positon.

DPS #2 is ALWAYS east.  He/she NEVER moves from this positon.

DPS #3 STARTS west, but will ADJUST if there are 2 enumerations in the same cardinal direction.

DPS #4 STARTS east, but will ADJUST if there are 2 enumerations in the same cardinal direction.

Thus, assume DPS #1 and DPS #2 are the recipients of the enumeration cirlces.  Congratulations, you are all set!  Ditto if #3 and #4 receive them, or #1 and #4, etc.

However, assume DPS # 1 and #3 receive the circles, leaving 2 enumerations in the west.  **In this case, DPS #3 and #4 make the simple adjustment of switching places.**  This will satisfy the condition of having one circle west, and one east.  I repeat, DPS #1 and #2 NEVER move.

I hope this helps some PFs get this chaotic adjustment mishmash under control and allow people to get to the final phases of the fight more often.",4,1583399688,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdspbc/applying_the_o11s_hands_strat_to_e6ss_conflag/,ffxiv,1

I have a screenshot but I don’t really know how to edit it to make it more readable. 

It happened while running Grand Cosmos for Expert Roulette. I don’t get the new player notification or anything. At the last boss, the healer dies pretty early to what I’m guessing was the blue fire DoT (I don’t know the name of the attack). I simply say, “to get rid of the dot you set furniture on fire”

We end up dying of course because we don’t have a healer. So right before we try again, I try to be helpful and just make the reminder “But yeah, red marker try to avoid the furniture. Blue marker, go to the furniture” 

The next attempt goes alright, she doesn’t die to the DoT. But suddenly the MCH from the same server as the healer goes “refrain from saying anything negative to her again or we’ll have problem” 

And I’m just really surprised and for some reason the healer is dead again and so is the MCH. I have no idea to what. I say “Umm what. I didn’t say anything negative. I was just saying a mechanic in case it was forgotten.”

I decide to leave after that because I don’t think that kind of attitude should be tolerated. I just wish I had been playing tank so it would’ve had a bigger impact, but either way the Expert Roulette queue isn’t a big deal. It’s crazy to me that anyone can even misconstrue what I said as negative. What bothers me the most is probably that they’ll go on continuing that attitude, being overly sensitive about completely neutral comments. How do they even stand being in the real world? Are they that insulated? Are they that insecure?",651,1583389516,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdr59p/so_im_glad_people_consider_the_community_of_this/,ffxiv,1
fdr0zl,Paikis,GC Squadrons and why they're better than a PC group.,"So after leveling all my healers and ranged physical from 20 to 60+ with GC squadrons, here's what I've learned.

**Class selection.**

ACN is king. Why? Because they will AoE (quite potently) and their pets will instantly attack things. They will also cast Physic if the tank (or you) are low on health and their bubbles apply slow, allowing you to almost not have to heal. THM is actually pretty bad, because they like to stand around for a few seconds before they do anything. ARC is OK, but it's hard to get them to use their AoE because it seems to require them to be in melee range, but they wont actually run into range. They also like to stand around instead of attacking. All the melee are good at killing bosses, but they generally wont AoE and most of your time in dungeons is spent killing trash. Again, they tend to stand around when a fight starts as well. It wasn't uncommon for my ACN to have a trash group half dead before the melee dudes would even have ran over to the pack.

You don't have an option for healer, so Conjuror it is and for tanks you really want the circular Flash over the cone Overpower... Overpower misses. A lot.

So, pick up a pair of Arcanists, a Conjuror and a Gladiator and don't look back.

**Tactics.**

You will start with all your guys on Independent tactics with no option to change it. You also start with only rank 1. These are both *BAD*. Obviously you want Offensive on your damage, but you can go either way with your tanks (I prefer Defensive). Healers should be on Defensive at all times. The real kicker here though is the ranks. A rank 5 Offensive will do 60% more damage, while a rank 1 Independent (the starter) will do only 4% more damage. Having double rank 5 offensive DPS is worth more than an extra squadron member. 

So how do you get the different tactics? You run your squadron through dungeons. This means that while you're leveling your first class with them, they'll be pretty bad. If you're leveling a healer, then you'll have to baby your tank and things will take a while to die. If you're leveling a tank, then you'll have to play defensively (Healers seem to heal late when not set to Defensive) and things will take a while to die. And if you're leveling a damage class then you'll have to AFK longer between packs (haha!). But once you've leveled their tactics it's like an entirely different game. 


Just for fun (LOL) I want back and ran some dungeons with the rank 1 Balanced tactics on my other squadron members after doing the same dungeon on the maxed ones. It's night and day. I ran The Vault in 14 minutes flat with my maxed squad with a GLD and 2 ACNs. It took 28 with the newbies (NIN, LNC, the same GLD).

**That's a lot of setup. Why not just run it with people?**

Because DF queues take time. Your queue was 5 minutes (fast for a damage class) and I'm half way through the dungeon. Because people make mistakes, or are learning their class, or are new to the dungeon, or have poor gear. All of these things will make the dungeon take longer. Squadron members are always on point. So what if they stand in an AoE? It's not going to kill them. I think I've had 5 or 6 times that a squadron member died while leveling 6 classes to 60+.

Squadrons are faster (after you've got them leveled) than all but the most optimised PC groups, they wont yell at you for doing bad damage or if you're leveling DPS, for straight up going AFK for entire packs. They also only occasionally require healing.

If you're only ever going to play the classes you already have leveled, then don't worry about your squadron... but if you're going to level multiple other classes, get them. Train them.

fdq5yj,Vaonari,Job boost / main scenario skip question,"Gonna preface this and say I have a main character that's been through the entire story since the beginning of 2.0 and have multiple jobs at 80.

Now with that said, a few friends of mine are playing on another server / datacenter and I don't want to ditch my current FC / friends to go join them. So the questions I have are

1. Is it worth both story skipping + boosting a job? Or is it better to boost a class and skip all the story?
2. Do I get gear from boosting a job or only the accessories and was it always like that?
3. Is there an actual recommendation for boosting a job such as a tank or healer? (Which one specifically I should say)

Something that is very few buttons.,"Hello I been watching some videos of FF14 for a while and it's looking awesome fun. I don't quite have the money right now to buy the game out, not sure if I can just play Sub on the Base game (trial) or not. 

Anyways my biggest question before getting into the trial and such is class that I can play that has the least amount of rotation / actions I guess. Clicking something multiple times not too bad it's more the constant multiple actions both on Brain Fog level as well as hurting my wrists / hands can be a problem.

I got a chronic pain issue and heck even my thumb once and a while goes out of order.

I also noticed the game supports gamepads and that is quite cool. Not sure if there is a recommended one to get might add that to me Christmas list if the price is fair. Something that works well (matching in game buttons and such).

Anyways any suggestions would be great.

fdpdcw,SlyeYce,I love BRD because it helps me with my amnesia,"Hear me out, I feel like this sounds a bit weird for people in general. But hi, nice to meet you.

I started playing the game a while ago and loved every seconds of it- in fact I stuck with BRD as my main for the whole time. I absolutely love it. And the music feature, I love it even more.

Now I'm no musician, I have no instruments irl. And I've got major amnesia from my past due to (many) traumatic events. It's really hard to remember anything from then unless a song is attached to it. I won't remember events, but I'll remember a song that was playing during it. 

This is where BRD gets into my heart, because sometimes, I start remembering a song from my early childhood, or even just the melody, I dawned on me that I could learn to play it with the harp or the lute, and so I started doing so. So far I know two of them, I just very recently remembered about one and I'm slowly learning it on the harp.

I never thought a game could help me that much actually, and I wish I could thank YoshiP for it. I doubt he'll ever see that but, thank you YoshiP, something you saved is also saving me in the most unexpected ways.

On that note, had anyone else here have something similar? I would love to hear.

fdm5ag,Lotdinn,[Ocean Fishing] PSA: Ocean fishing is a NON-cooperative activity,"...And the Nash equilibrium isn't quite there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the drama about people jumping boats early and controversy about the ""optimal"" skill usage I felt like some analysis is in order.

I'm excluding the achievement parties (octo/shark/jelly/seahorse) from the scope of this discussion as they're premade and suffer less from all the miscommunication.

And here's the ocean fishing spreadsheet in case someone hasn't seen it yet, all the data referred to in this post comes from here, essentially. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brCfvmSdYl7RcY9lkgm\_ds8uaFqq7qaxOOz-5BfHuuk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1brCfvmSdYl7RcY9lkgm_ds8uaFqq7qaxOOz-5BfHuuk/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

So, what's the necessary components of getting a high score?

1. Get on a good route (very hard to get 16k otherwise, for 10k and the mount not really needed).
2. Proc several Spectral Currents as a party. **NOT NEGOTIABLE**, whatever you do outside of spectrals won't matter if you don't get a single spectral current on the trip. ^(note)
3. Get any lucky with Double Hooks and, **in niche cases**, Patience for the points.

^(note) Southern Merlthor SC is the worst of them all points-wise and is there to balance RNG out since Southern is present in every single route.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are under an impression that points you score outside of spectral currents remotely compare to spectral currents ones, go check out the spreadsheet, this really needs to be taken out of the way before anything else. They still matter, just FAR FAR less than just having a spectral in the zone, let alone DHing 2-3x for 800 (1600 if lucky) points a pop.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the perfect scenario for scoring points given all this?

&gt;!To use patience 1 outside of Spectrals and get some points for HQ fish while \_someone else\_ procs a spectral.!&lt;

A takeaway from this? The perfect *fair* strategy - that is, treating all the participants equally - involves everyone (assuming lvl 71+) pretty much letting all fish go and only using Surface Slap and Chum until a spectral happens and fishing with patience1 on happily ever after.

The Nash equilibrium mentioned at the start of this post, however, dictates something slightly different - that if some people start using patience *before* the spectral they do get more points than otherwise long as a full duration spectral still happens. At some point, it hurts everyone as more and  more people switch to this strategy (as the spectral becomes highly unlikely at all), so it's optimal to keep trying for spectral for all the others who don't get any points for that.

It results in some gain for one group of people (patience users) at the expense of the other group of people (spectral proccers). The situation is further complicated by that people start feeling intimidated by the entire ocean fishing endeavor and think that there are some expectations in place and they can't just go in, do their own thing and take in the scenery and that's just not cool. That eerily reminds of all the ""no dps healers"" holy war which lasted for years except, unlike combat content, there's no set goal in place!

&amp;#x200B;

To wrap it up - it is normal to do your own thing while on the boat even if all you want to do is /gpose. SE didn't put anything in place (and probably wouldn't) to narrow down the scope of objectives. Don't go full griefing mode though and do that just to ruin everyone else on the boat (obviously).

\[From my very limited experience\] you need about 30-50% of the boat actually trying to proc a spectral to get into a shiny high score land, bit fewer than that to get the mount. For this reason and due to scaling, small boats are still preferable because that way you can ensure enough people hunting for spectrals.

If you look around and see 7x lvl80s without a Surface Slap buff before the spectral, either give up and go with the flow or take it upon yourself to try for a spectral for your party. 8x people not trying for spectral are off even from the Nash equilibrium, you'll get more points on average^(note) even if it's you switching to the spectral chasing mode.

^(note) There is also a problem of ""average"" vs ""average chance to score above X"" and it's much more complicated. Don't think there's enough data on this but gut feeling still tells me you oughta pop at least some SCs.",12,1583365488,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdm5ag/ocean_fishing_psa_ocean_fishing_is_a/,ffxiv,1

I came from the MMORPG Blade &amp; Soul which I really enjoyed and loved since the beta release in 2015 (?). I played really much MMORPGs before but Blade &amp; Soul was a bit different for me. The combat system, the raids, the story and the community. I enjoyed kinda every part of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm that person, that also spends money to something I enjoy. I also paid some money for Blade &amp; Soul in the past. May it be costumes or some stuff which helps me to improve my gear a bit... But that's the thing where the P2W aspect kicks in. You can literally stand there and grind for something you really need, while some people just transfer some money and gain exactly (or better) stuff that you just got from grinding for couple of weeks/months. Thats the wrong direction.

&amp;#x200B;

**The problems always got bigger and impacted more and more of the game.**

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I can clearly say, that the company will milking the cow until the game dies. Over the last months/years the P2W aspects got stronger and stronger, that F2P player don't even have the chance the catch up with their Gear. The last ingame-events were a absolute disaster which increased the gap between rich and poor incredible. The communication between developer and western publisher is horrible. The whole community let them know that it's really bad what they do. They promised us a engine update to UE4 almost 2-3 years ago. Right now, it's just on the korean test servers with huge amount of bugs, performance issues etc. And I believe, the western server will be dead before the engine update will reach the western live servers. This list could be so much longer, but I suppose that you understand what I mean.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved on right now and looked for some new opportunities on other MMORPGs.

&amp;#x200B;

I tested a bit BDO (because really much people left Blade &amp; Soul for it). I enjoyed it until I realized that the lategamecontent fits not that what I want from a MMORPG.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I thought about Final Fantasy XIV and checked it's current state. **I really liked it.**

&amp;#x200B;

All people I met ingame and had nice conversations with were really kind. 

The graphics and the engine are pretty smooth.

And it's not really P2W.

&amp;#x200B;

Those are the most important aspects for me to play a game.

&amp;#x200B;

I would still hope for Blade &amp; Soul to turn to the right way, but I guess it's too late now. And that might not happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading \^-\^

fdl983,MrCombineSoldier,The Tragic of Vauthry And The Sympathy For Only Certain Villains,"^(I will preface this by saying, no, Vauthry's actions are not excusable; however, the same people that seem to excuse the Ascian's millions upon millions of murders seem to vilify Vauthry more than Emet-Selch himself due to seeing Emet as a ""tragic"" character.)

&amp;#x200B;

I previously [did a write up on Zenos](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/f9fjvy/a_retrospective_look_at_zenos_yae_galvus_after_52/), and felt that there was more about Shadowbringers that people seem to ignore. When people think about the story of Shadowbringers and the tragedies that come with them, it seems as if little people actually think about that of Vauthry. In the case of Emet, his story is well known and highly discussed among the XIV audience. At this point everyone is aware of the story that became of Amaurot and the ancients. Its highly regarded and people are very sympathetic for him. However, I rarely, if ever, see people discuss the tale of Vauthry.

&amp;#x200B;

Before his birth, Emet-Selch approached Vauthry's parents and bestowed upon them an offer allowing them to stay in power. The offer was to imbue an unborn child with the power of a ungodly Light Warden. Even before his birth Vauthry was used as a tool to not only further his parents plan, but the ascians as a whole. [Raised as a ""God,""](https://files.catbox.moe/fgcdog.png) Vauthry saw himself as nothing less than so. He had no reason to doubt himself, he and he alone had the power to control the beasts that were destroying civilization and the entire world of the first. Vauthry was born as [""man and sin eater both,""](https://files.catbox.moe/6c4uki.png) a higher form of those who remained after the flood of light. In his eyes, he was a hero, and those who opposed him and Eulmore [were the villains.](https://files.catbox.moe/ihy0m3.png) In Vauthry's dying breathes, he still believed this. He never saw himself as evil, not once in his entire life. He was a God, he was hope, he was righteousness. And there were those that rightfully believed in him, [believed in someone who has become MORE than man](https://files.catbox.moe/cafr19.png). People are not perfect and [""Man \[are\] flawed creatures""](https://files.catbox.moe/y16dnx.png) that will do nothing but further the First's descent into destruction. People are very sympathetic about the fallen world of the ancients, but people are quick to forget how much death the Flood of Light caused. Being a reflection of Eorzea, Norvrandt is the only surviving relic of what used to be an entire planet. To put it in perspective of Hydaelyn, Othard, Hingashi, Ilsabard, Meracydia, Thavnair, The Old, and New World were all wiped from existence. This left the people that still remained alive on the First hopeless, and for some, even Vauthry's feeble attempt to hold onto civilization spoke with them. Vauthry's life was [rigged from the start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TyY_hx0qn0). He was a tool used by the Ascians to further an inevitable plan, he could have done everything right as still would have been used to harbor the light warden that consumed him and lead to his demise.

&amp;#x200B;

Not only was it rigged for the character of Vauthry, it was the same for Vauthry's in-game model. Compared to Emet, Vauthry isn't anything to admire. Vauthry has an ugly, grotesque outward appearance and a much less romanticized voice. There was a comment I saw a while back if you switched the models of Emet and Vauthry and kept everything the same, things would have ended out very differently how people perceived the two. Its very interesting looking at how a characters motives can be seen in one light or the other. In conculusion, Vauthry was an awful person who was dealt a bad hand before he was born. The tale of Vauthry is sadly forgotten or ignored by those who want to praise Emet. Thanks for listening to my TED talk about Vauthry, though this may die on New, hope to see some interesting discussion in the comments.",174,1583361833,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdl983/the_tragic_of_vauthry_and_the_sympathy_for_only/,ffxiv,1

fdkw19,Renathras,"Fresh level 80, ready to gear up? Time for a 5.2 update!","The last one seemed to help a lot of people, so while I'm sure there will be some saying of nay, let's do this again to lay out the process.  First, the quick bullet points for those that don't like a lot of reading:

Bullet point format:

1) Finish MSQ!!  Ideally up to 5.3, but you might need to get some gear upgrades for the later dungeons.

2) Dungeons for ilevel 430(5.0)/445(5.1)/455(5.2) gear.  Your first goal is to get to ilevel 425 so you can enter Eden 1-4.

3) Eden 1-4 once you have the ilevel for it (again 425).  Run 1-4, then run Eden 4 three more times to get a total of 4 weapon tokens.  After that, you can run it to fill in more slots or move on to Copied Factory if you have the ilevel for it.  Copied Factory requires ilevel 435, so that's your next goal here.

4) Copied Factory for 460 left side pieces (excluding belt) and for Manufactured Coins to upgrade your Pantasmagoria pieces.

5) Upgrade your Eden 4 weapon.  Buy/Upgrade any Phantasmagoria gear you have to get to ilevel 455.  Remember you can upgrade one of these pieces for each Copied Factory run/Manufactured Coin you get for downing the NieR 24 man's final boss.

6) Eden 5-8.  Make sure to do these at least once per week,  ESPECIALLY Eden 8 as the weapon token is the most time gated factor of all.

7) Buy Allegory gear (490) to fill out slots.  Note that Eden 5-8 tokens also provide 490 gear.  The Allegory gear should be upgradable in 5.3 with whatever the Manufactured Coin equivalent will be from the next NieR raid, which will probably also drop left-side armor pieces of 490 ilevel.  Note that until 5.4, these will be limited to only one per week, though.

...you should try to be capping on Allegory (450 per week limit) each week.  Running a single Expert roulette per day gets you 90, so doing that alone for 5 days will cap you for the week.  You'll also be getting 10 or so per Eden 5-8 run, and some here and there from running other stuff (if you get in on a Hunt Train, you're looking at a bunch there, too.)

8) If you get to 470 and want to do so, try running Ruby Weapon Extreme and Eden Savage.  I highly recommend watching a guide video on YouTube first, though... :D

.

ALTERNATE PATH) Spend money.  You can buy 490 pieces with gil, though they're still a bit pricy for a new player.  Feel free to check your local Market Board.  You can also buy the older 450 or 470 pieces to fill out holes in your gear, since they may be quite a bit cheaper.   Again, check your local Market Board/crafter friends to see what's on offer.  If you go this route, it should get you to 455, and you can start on step (6) above, or if you go all out for the 490s...you're still going to want to farm Eden 8 for the weapon token and probably get Allegory pieces since those upgrade via Eden Savage/and probably the 5.4 24 man raid, but all 490 gear would have you raid ready for Ruby Ex/Eden 5-8 Savage, so go ham.

.

""Less bullet points, more words?!"" you ask while simultaneously exclaiming?

Eh, okay.  :)

If you have money, as always, you can buy the crafted gear.  If you don't (or don't want to blow it), then the path is still MOSTLY the same as it was before.  Overall, you can run the 80 dungeons for gear (the first 3 give 430 accessories, the 5.1 drops 445 gear, the 5.2 one drops 455 gear).  You can still run Eden 1-4, and they're totally farmable.  Running E4 (Titan) 4x will give you 4 weapon tokens that, with 1,000 tomestones of Phastasmagoria,  you can turn into a weapon (more on the specific steps of doing those exchanges blow.)

The big changes with 5.2 are that (a) now Copied Factory is also totally farmable, with you being able to roll on the loot as much as you want (drops 460 left side armor pieces aside from the belt), and this  includes getting the Manufactured Coins from the final boss of the run, that (b) new crafted gear of ilevel 490 has been added, and that (c) Eden 5-8 have been added (which are not ""farmable"" in the sense  you can only get one item token per boss per week and 1 weapon token from the Eden 8 boss per week - you CAN run them as much as you want and pass on the tokens you don't want, if you want to gun for a specific piece like boots or chest or whatever, though; but you can only get one TOKEN per boss per week, so keep that in mind).  With the Manufactured Coins you can buy upgrade pieces that will turn 460 Phantasmagoria  tomestone gear into 470 gear.  This includes your weapon that you got  from running Titan and 1,000 Phasma.

As always: Finish the MSQ first, then unlock Eden 1-4, you only need 425 ilevel to run it, and can farm it for 450  gear and your 460 weapon tokens from Eden 4.  At the least, unless you're ready for Ex fights, it's the best way to get your weapon.  If you don't have the  ilevel for Eden 1-4 yet, run the 80 dungeons until you do, and you can always buy a piece of Phantasmagoria tomestone gear (I recommend rings first, since you have two ring slots) to help out.  Even if the loot drops aren't upgrades, the Pantasmagoria is, as you buy 460 pieces with it.

Once you've unlocked Eden 1-4, run them all at least once for the clears, then run Eden 4 three times more so you have a total of 4 weapon tokens.

While you're doing this, you'll be getting Phasma tomestones.  Make  sure to save 1,000 for your weapon (or 300 for your shield and 700 for  your weapon, if PLD).  Once you've run Eden 4 (Titan) 4x, you don't need to keep running it (unless you want the extra tokens for alt Job weapons) and can just run whichever Eden 1-4 fights are easiest for you.  You can roll need on everything with no penalty for Eden 1-4, and you should be able to fill out most/all of your accessory/belt slots by doing so.

Somewhere in here, you should get enough ilevel to start running Copied Factory (ilevel 435).  Doing this is good once you have your Eden 4 weapon since you can use the Manufactured Coin from the final boss to upgrade it to 470, which is a pretty nice boost.  Each run gets you 1 coin, and each coin can upgrade one piece of 460 Phasma gear to 470.  The loot drops are the non-belt/accessory armors, are 460 ilevel, and should be nice upgrades.  You will EVENTUALLY want to replace these with Pantasma pices which you can upgrade, but they're nice stopgaps to fill in holes.  Note that the NieR gear ITSELF cannot be upgraded.

OF ALL STATS, WEAPON DAMAGE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ALL.  This includes healers/casters, as your spell potency also scales with weapon damage.

The goal is to get to 455 so you can run Eden 5-8 at least once per week (again, this is the time gated part, so you'll want to get at least one token per week from the bosses, and at least one clear of Eden 8  per week for the weapon token).  You can continue farming roulettes, Copied Factory, and even Eden 1-4 for tomestones and to shore up stubborn holes in your gear.  Remember that Phantasmagoria 460 pieces can be upgraded to 470 with Manufactured Coins.  So if you're capped on Phantasma and have a NieR piece like gloves or pants, ""side-grading"" that to the 460 is fine since you can then upgrade it to 470 with a Manufcatured Coin.  Eden 8's weapon token drops, since you can only get one of THOSE per week and you'll need 7 for your 490  weapon, are a high priority.  So if you have a super busy week, you should try to at least knock out one Eden 8 clear, even if you can't run the others for tokens or cap on Allegory that week.

The NEXT goal is ilevel 470, as this is required for running the new  Ex ""Primal"" (Cinder Drift/Ruby Weapon) and Eden 5-8 Savage.  So for this, you'll be upgrading all your gear to Phantasmagoria gear (460) then upgrading it with Manufactured Coins into 470 pieces, while  spending the new tomestones (Allegory) and Eden 5-8 tokens to get 490 gear.

...keep in mind that on about week 5/6 that you're farming Eden 8,  you'll want to start saving Allegory so that in week 7, when you get  your seventh weapon token, you'll have 1,000 Allegory tometones to put  with it to get your shiny new 490 weapon!

And keep in mind that Allegory gear will likely upgrade into 500 gear in 5.3.  (The non-weapon pieces: The weapon is usually a patch later, as this lets Savage have exclusive access to weapons a bit longer.)

.

Important terms:

Tomestones of...

...Goetia: If you have any of these left, go to Mor Dhona.  One of the three NPCs at the Tomestone desk there will convert them to Phantasmarogia for you.  You can't buy anything with them anymore, so just upgrade them.  (Incidently, the guy on the right is the one you get Ruby Weapon EX weapons from, NOT the guy in Eulmore...)

...Phantasmagoria: These are your bread and butter.  Use them for your weapon (costs 1,000, or 700 weapon/300 shield if PLD), and then use them to shore up gear holes with 460 gear.  The gear you buy with these upgrades to 470 pieces with Manufactured Coins.  This can also be thought of as the ""lesser tomestone"" or ""lower grade"" tomestone for patches 5.2 and 5.3.

...Allegory: You can only get 450 of these per week, so try to cap each week if you can.  You get them from running roulettes (look at the rewards to see which roulettes give them) and the final bosses of Expert dungeons, as well as Eden bosses, etc.  These can be used to buy 490 gear, which will be upgradable in 5.3 to 500 gear.  Remember you'll need 1,000 of these on week 7 of your Eden 8 farm to get your weapon, so plan ahead!  This can be thought of as the ""greater tomestone"" or ""higher grade"" tomestone for patches 5.2 and 5.3

(The tomestone vendor is in Eulmore, second from the left, on that long row on the big open balcony.  His name is Aymark &lt;Tomestone  Exchange&gt; )

Eden's Gate: Eden 1-4

Eden's Verse: Eden 5-8

Armor token (Eden) exchanges:

4 chest tokens = 1 chest item  
4 leg tokens = 1 pants item  
2 glove tokens = 1 glove item  
2 helm tokens = 1 helm item  
2 boot tokens = 1 boot item  
1 belt token = 1 belt item  
1 accessory token (looks like a ring) = 1 accessory item (can be traded for ring, bracer, necklace, OR earring)

(The  vendor for these is in Eulmore, all the way on the right.  It's the Kobold named Yhal Yal &lt;Eden Relic  Exchange&gt;.  You can browse his items once you unlock him (shortly  after unlocking Eden itself) to verify what tokens you need for what and plan out what you want to purchase.  Antiquity items are 450 Eden 1-4, Golden Antiquity are 490 Eden 5-8.)

.

Got your 4 weapon tokens from Eden 4 and 1,000 Phantasmagoria tomestones?  This dance can be a bit confusing for first timers, so let me walk you through it.  Note you will do this same thing with Eden 8 weapon tokens, just you'll need 7 of them (probably lowered to 4 in patch 5.3) and Allegory tomestones instad.

You'll go to Eulmore once again for this.  Go to Aymark again, this time to the ""Phantasmagoria (Other)"" list, and buy 10x of Mowen's Tokens...UNLESS YOU ARE A PALADIN!!  Each cost 100, so 1,000 Phantasmagoria gets you your 10.  For PLD specifically, ONLY BUY 7.  This is because you need only 7 for the sword.  You spend 300 in the DoW Phantasmagoria item list to outright buy the shield.  So buy your 7 and then buy your shield for 300.

With Mowen Tokens in hand, next go to Yhal Yal and to any of the first three (Edgengate Antique Exchange) options.  Buy the item at the very bottom, ""Lightweight Tomestone"".  Again, they each take 4 sword tokens to buy.

Now you have all the pieces!  Go to Fathard &lt;Token Exchange&gt;, the vendor between them in the middle of that long row of vendors.  (This is also the NPC to see if you are trading Titania/Innocence/Hades Ex tokens for gear).  The option you want is ""Deepshadow Gear Exchange"".  Here you trade in 10 of the Mowen's Tokens (7 for PLD) and 1 Lightweight  Tomestone and get...your ilevel 460 weapon!

While you're chatting with Farthard...

...look under Glorious Gegaws.  Note the top three items cost one Manufactured Coin to buy, and read the descriptions of them.  The first is used to upgrade your weapon.  The second to upgrade armor (helm/chest/gloves/pants/boots), and the third is for accessories/belts.  When you're ready for an upgrade, buy the item for what you're trying to upgrade, and go to the NPC at the left end of the counter.  This is where you'll exchange them.  Again: Remember to remove any materia before doing so, as it will be lost otherwise.

.

That should about wrap it up.  Hope this helps folks new to the max level game and gets you well on your way to knocking it out of the park!",56,1583360373,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdkw19/fresh_level_80_ready_to_gear_up_time_for_a_52/,ffxiv,2

fdh1l0,misterfrond,Question for Healers: Would you trade DPS auxiliary role for a support role?,"I've always found DPSing as a healer rather dull, maybe a bit stale, and a bit jarring. When I'm healing its of course required to be tuned into the fight, but the refreshing part to me has always been playing a class where I am focused on my party - how are they doing? are they making mistakes? how can I support them?

Spending any minute I'm not healing spamming a 2-button DPS rotation seems to take away from that for me.

Other MMOs, notably FFXI, had support roles where you would spend the majority if not the entirety of your time focusing on maintaining or accessing a buff, while off-healing as able.

I think we went in this direction in 3.0, a bit, with some of the early concept for Astrologian. It's been significantly walked back since then but I think there was an early notion that while WHM and SCH would be dealing damage with their free time, AST would instead focus on buff management (cards) contributing similar amounts of damage to the party by enhancing their party members instead of doing it themselves.

How do people feel about this kind of gameplay? Is doing your own DPS more rewarding? Would you rather be playing a buffing minigame or casting longer-cast spells that buff the party instead of spamming Dia and Broil?

Personally I would really enjoy spending my non-healing time boosting my party with appropriate en-spells, debuffing enemies, or granting bespoke buffs that require a little thought and management to keep up. Especially if the net DPS gain, at the end of the day, was the same as spamming a rather narrow set of healer DPS spells.

FFXIV is never going to have ""buffer"" classes like some games with its trinity approach, but I think that support functions over dps functions on healers would be a welcome alternative.

&gt;So I dunno if this thing has been suggested earlier but I seriously dont understand why SE can't add this thing from patch 1.0. We should be able to see which slot of your Armoury Chest is preventing you from switching between your jobs.  
Yeah, you can sorta see it already because the item cap is 35 so just free your slots that are 35 already you say. But its not that simple, I for example have almost all of my slots at 35 but for some reason, some of them affect ability to switch and some dont. So when you are hitted with this notification ""Insufficient Armoury Chest space"" you have to clear out your every 35/35 slot in order to find out which slot is affecting your ability to switch. And this is not convenient at all. There should some kind of indicator, something like: Insufficient Armoury Chest space in Rings, Wrists, Hands etc"".

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-QXEPeH0_efez-MSBEatRUS5zqU2Bcn_2fikWdeH_nk/edit#gid=1089026467

When I saw the full results released for the NHK poll I decided to translate it so I could discuss it with my friends.  Emet-selch's popularity is certainly universal, it seems!

I think an organized poll of this magnitude is pretty great, but I hope that if there's ever something like this again it can get responses worldwide.  Some of the results had graphs attached to them that broke down demographic data of votes (gender, age bracket) but another poll that shows popularity according to geographical region would be super interesting.

It took me a little bit of time to get this done, so I thought I would share it here in case anyone else is interested.

I've been a Final Fantasy fan since the first one released on the NES in 1990.  I lived in Japan 20 years ago but I haven't had a chance to use much Japanese for the last decade.  I wouldn't consider myself a fluent speaker but written Japanese is still a-ok for me.  It was a fun undertaking to use my knowledge of the FF series and to take on a small translation project for the first time in a very long time!

Hope you enjoy it :)",62,1583328470,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdczpv/i_made_a_translation_of_the_nhk_fan_poll_its_cool/,ffxiv,1

fdb9qs,Rerrison,Labyrinth of the Ancients always draw whiny people.,"So I figured out this mysterious phenomenon, that when you queue up for Alliance Raid roulette and get the Labyrinth, there are particularly more number of people who whine at a single mechanic failure. 

Ancient Flare tops it all off. They bring up some toxic macro to salt on the party and never stop whining and complaining. The thing is, if I queue up for just 4 ppl dungeon, I mostly meet nice and supportive people who, in the early stage of my gaming, made me have good impression on the community. 

I wonder if this is a specific thing about the Labyrinth, or just a general Alliance Raids thing. My guess is that simply the possibility of meeting toxic people goes up as Alliance Raid include more people, but still the amount of toxic people I see at raids is quite mysterious since FFXIV is known for quite nice community.   


p.s I hope they remember that there will always be newcomers in the game, and as long as they're playing an MMO newcomers' mistakes are just natural. If you don't like it, just go play Sekiro or whatever, no one will bother.",74,1583318756,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fdb9qs/labyrinth_of_the_ancients_always_draw_whiny_people/,ffxiv,1

fdautj,bobdole4eva,Advice on Shadowbringers Endgame,"Hi good folks,

I'm hoping for a bit of advice and/or guidance about the endgame content at level 80. For a bit of background, I have been playing FFXIV since 2.0 (I technically played the beta for 1.0, but as I didn't then buy the game for obvious reasons, I don't count that) and played each main story plus some dungeon and trial content as they happened. 

However, despite having played for so long, I never took part in any Savage, Extreme or Ultimate content. This was for a number of reasons...the friends I joined the game with were also happy not to do those things, I also had varying degrees of interest and free time. Point is, I don't consider myself particularly good at the hardest content. With that in mind, I am slightly apprehensive to go into Eden Normal or anything above it.

My questions are thus, is it possible or plausible to take on 5(?) levels of Eden Normal in duty finder rather than party finder? Is tanking drastically harder in this content than the story content (I've never actually done a tank swap, despite knowing the theory)? Also, how much of an advantage will being over geared give me, as this is something I've never really known. I know the entry level for Eden N is 425, my current ilevel on my Warrior is 473...will I likely feel a difference in difficulty compared to those who ran it fresh when it came out?

Sorry if these seem odd questions, I just don't want to load into the raid and be a massive drag on the group, especially as a tank!

I haven't played many MMOs before, however I've done some research into how the game plays and wanted some living input that isn't targeted towards meta players so I can jump into endgame asap and perform at an acceptable level. In most team oriented games, I favor off tanks, prioritizing dps builds that can't really die with competent play (mostly cuz I'm pretty stupid) and in watching some end game guides on Youtube and doing some reading I'm not really picking up on anything that plays like I'm used to so am looking for advice on the best way to play tanky DPS, what races, classes, jobs, and anything else important to developing proper endgame builds.

fd8wzk,Emperormaxis,Having Trouble Healing,"I'm not sure if this is the place to ask, but. 

As a healer, (white mage) I have an extremely difficult time keeping the tank alive. Not sure what to do. (Current content)

I'll run through a scenario;

Tank pulls a group of mobs, I cast regen on them. Then they run along and grab a second group of mobs. Not supposed to be a big deal. 

Within 5-10 seconds, I have already used all my cooldowns (tetragammation, assize, divine benison, benediction) and the tank's health is very rapidly falling. Medica II isnt enough to keep them afloat, even combined with regen, so I am forced to resort to spamming cure over and over, which often isnt enough. 

What am I not doing to keep the tank's health up? Am I supposed to spam cure? I'm not sure what other buttons to press. This has been a dilemma for me since stormblood. I just can't keep up with the damage the tank takes.

I really want to play healer, but it feels like I dont have the reaction time to do it properly, and I must be missing something. Can anyone help?",27,1583303105,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fd8wzk/having_trouble_healing/,ffxiv,1

fd5dyz,PrincessPeachyPom,(Eden's Verse Spoilers) Furor Strange Noises/Talking?,"So recently when the patch installed for 5.2 with the new content, sometime during the month my sound effects started to fade? First it started with Ramuh's horses that give knockback (their neigh's were silent), then the new shark mount (Hybodus) wouldn't make a noise after a while (the swishing sounds of the waves or the summoning horn wouldn't make a noise) and just tonight, Shiva in Eden didn't talk, or make any ice sounds.

During the ending of the raid, Gia also was mute during the cutscene. Her smashing the ice to break us free also made no noise. At this point? I thought I gotta reinstall to hopefully fix my sound, I told my FC mates I would do it after stream.

So we get to our last raid for drops, Furor.

Everything seemed normal, some sounds were missing but nothing major just no fire sounds. But when Ifrit and Garuda merged to Raktapaksa, I started hearing strange noises whenever the boss would do the attack Radiant Plumes. At first my friends thought I was messing around or even going mental.

We got out of the raid and I didn't get my weekly drop so we went back in - I turned all my audio down except for voices up high. I heard the voices clear as day, and so did the rest of my stream at the time. I even had someone clip it for me.

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/561545379](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/561545379)

\^ the full clip is here, it's a very long clip but it starts to pick up with high audio around 14:30 if you want to skip to that.

Honestly we all came to the conclusion that my sound files were just REALLY fucked up and maybe moved around somehow?? But it sounded like a fucking creepy pasta when I first heard it I was honestly just shocked lol

I'm betting this is either audio from another language or possibly cut audio? But I'm wondering if anyone else has heard this before? Or is it just me? Please lemme know if anyone can translate it or possibly give me an explination? Thanks all! (Yes I plan to reinstall my game soon and hope this fixes the sound effects issue!)",11,1583285747,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fd5dyz/edens_verse_spoilers_furor_strange_noisestalking/,ffxiv,1

My PC detects the controller, and I can use it in the start menu and other games perfectly fine.

FFXIV however also detects the controller but no input seems to work from it the vast majority of the time. Occasionally I boot up the game and it works, but most of the time no input is doing anything. Gamepad is enabled, and it even shows up on the dropdown menu, but no dice.

Sometimes it works if I change the Steam Input Per Game setting to Forced On. Then it'll work.... once. Then the next time I play, it doesn't work again, even though the setting is still on. I have to launch the game, see it doesn't work, change to Forced Off, close the game, launch it again, change back to Forced On, close the game, launch it again.

You think it unfair that you are subject to wipes? That your uptime will be sacrificed for the clear? Look at me! I have fought a thousand *THOUSAND* of your lockouts! I have crafted with you, fought with you, learned with you, wiped with you! Made diagrams, and yes called the entire fight. 

For eons I have measured your worth and found you wanting! Too weak and feeble-minded to clear *any* fight! Have your recent spats with Ramuh and his lightning taught you nothing? Have you not learned that your ignorance and frality beget only endless wipes?  How long do you mean to perpetuate this farce? How much more must I endure your bumbling ignorance?  

Let us imagine that the days of living liquid return to us, and all statics face true annihilation.  Do you honestly believe that you could clear the fight? OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T!

Moat of them got bored because of the slow combat and the story not so appealing till much more later.

I think it will be better to extend the free trial to level 50, to make new player:
1- get the story 
2- get better overview at the combat system, as more skills are unlocked.

Also to prevent abuse all restriction are kept when free trial.

    What a krill
    With darkness and no bites through the night

    What a tug on my line
    But you’re not biting!

    On my line, there’ll be no one else
    Fine! ...sand is what I'll make from you! (Bait Eater)
    I’m still catching bream, Bait Eater!
    
    Someday you bite in the rain,
    And someday you mooch off a bullfrog
    It’s ordeal, to wait for your window
    For the day we see you caught!

fczu3h,Quagmiresire,The mandatory 2.X MSQ grind sold me on this game.,"I know everyone is sick of hot takes on the mandatory 2.1-2.5 MSQ progression, but I just finished this part of the game and wanted to add a little positivity to the discussion. If I'm totally off base please feel free to downvote me into oblivion.  In short, I loved these quests,and the fact that I couldnt skip them to go straight for Heavensward made me feel like I was playing a real roleplaying game as opposed to the traditional theme park grind of most MMOs. 

I popped over to FFXIV from WoW after it became obvious that Blizzard wasnt going to fully support the most recent expansion after it flopped. I dont hate WoW or anything, and I'll definitely be back, so dont want this read as some sort of circlejerky anti-WoW post.  Anyway, one of WoWs major design choices that in my opinion has really held the game back was the decision in 2009 to make it so only the most recent six months of content was relevant.  WoW blasts you to max level in a period of weeks and then dumps you straight into the most recent raid. That is how the game has been since the middle of Wrath of the Lich King. I always disliked this because it felt like the game was making itself seem very small in the short term interest of congregating all players around the newest shiniest content.  The experience feels like being asked to start at episode 65 of a TV series with 66 episodes rather than starting at episode 1. For me at least,  satisfaction is derived not from being caught up with everyone else, but rather from knowing that I still have 60 more episodes to watch. WoW is such a huge game and it's a real shame that it trivializes more than 90% of it's own content.

FFXIV has not done that to me, at least in my experience.  Requiring me to play through all these MSQs is the exact opposite of the design philosophy described above. I dont feel like missed out on ARR by not playing it when it was current. I got the full experience of not just playing the story but also nearly all of the group content at the level for which it was originally intended. When the word Heavensward flashed across my screen for the first time it felt like I had reached a real milestone. ARR was not just some obstacle in my race to endgame; it was a f*cking journey. Like in a real RPG. Not being at endgame has not at all hindered my ability to socialize, make friends, and group up either. Honestly, I hope I never reach endgame because I dont want this journey to end.",258,1583263314,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fczu3h/the_mandatory_2x_msq_grind_sold_me_on_this_game/,ffxiv,1

fcziex,unlimitedblack,Jobs in Cinematics,"Let's review. 

The 1.0 cinematic is... a bit all over the place really, because Ardbert is an Archer, Lamimi is a Thaumaturge (with... Protect?), Cylva(?) is a Gladiator, and Blanhaerz is a Marauder. While J'rhoomale and Nyelbert show up in the initial part, it's not clear what their jobs are since we don't see them in combat. 

The 2.0 cinematic cements Team Ardbert into the roles we see them in as the Warriors of Darkness later: 

* Ardbert: Warrior
* Blanhaerz: Paladin
* Lamimi: White Mage
* Nyelbert: Black Mage
* J'rhoomale: Bard

Heavensward shows Ardbert swapping from Warrior to Dragoon (and shows us Estinien to boot). 

Stormblood shows us Ardbert as a Monk, as well as Lyse as a Monk in Dancer garb. Later we see Ardbert as a Samurai. Yugiri (whom we recognize as a Ninja) and Gosetsu (whom we recognize as a Samurai) also appear.

Shadowbringers really leans into Ardbert's job changes, because after the intro, he cycles through ALL of the jobs he held previously, in order (Archer --&gt; Warrior --&gt; Dragoon --&gt; Monk --&gt; Samurai) before popping into Dark Knight. Meanwhile, Thancred shows up as Gunbreaker, Urianger appears in his Astrologian gear, and Y'shtola appears in her Matoya garb (which leaves her actual job ambiguous, since she still seems to use conjury AND thaumaturgy). And Lyna shows up as a Dancer. 

So where does this leave us in terms of jobs that haven't shown up in cinematics yet?

Tanks: All four tank jobs have appeared in cinematics, though Ardbert/Derplander has only appeared as two of them.

Healers: White Mage and Astrologian have both appeared in cinematics. Scholar has not. Notable Scholars among prominent named characters include Alphinaud.

Melee DPS: Three of the four melee DPS jobs have been displayed by Ardbert himself, and Ninja has made a cameo in the form of Yugiri (though we didn't see her do anything). 

Physical Ranged DPS: Dancer and Bard have both shown up in cinematics. Machinist has not (unless you want to count Cid, which I guess technically?). Other notable named Machinists include Hilda.

Magic Ranged DPS: Black Mage has shown up via Nyelbert (and technically Y'shtola). Summoner, Red Mage and Blue Mage have not. Alisaie is a notable named Red Mage, though we don't have any specific summoners to call on (aside from the partial-Summoner element that Alphinaud brings in) or any Blue Mages of significance. 

So, jobs that haven't appeared yet:

* Scholar
* Machinist
* Summoner
* Red Mage
* Blue Mage

Jobs that have appeared but haven't really been showcased are:

* Ninja
* ... no, really, that's it. Urianger only shows off cards as Astrologian, but between that and talking about fate that really tells you all you need to know about the job from a fantasy standpoint.

If I were to speculate about what'll happen in 6.0's cinematic, it's a pretty decent possibility that we see some of these other jobs showcased. It's also a distinct possibility that we see whatever new jobs are coming in 6.0 shown off as well, since generally speaking the cinematics have more recently been doing that (Samurai was new for Stormblood, Gunbreaker and Dancer were new for Shadowbringers). That said, this correlation isn't perfect: Dark Knight was a new job in Heavensward but wasn't really showcased until Shadowbringers, and while Dragoon was a major focus of the Heavensward cinematic, it was a launch job for 1.0/2.0, not an expansion job.

So there's some stuff we can guess at given the past as prologue, but it's always possible that something really unexpected happens. We'll just have to see.",32,1583262105,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcziex/jobs_in_cinematics/,ffxiv,1

fcyhuc,Dante00000,Just completed Copied Factory for the first time. Holy Shit.,"I'm already a huge fan of NieR and especially Automata, so when I first started playing the game right near the end of last year, I was seeing a lot of buzz about the NieR raid, but I didn't think anything of it because I was still a new player getting through Realm Reborn and it seemed like a distant dream to ever even think about raiding. Well here I am today, having completed it for the first time on my newly max level Dancer and I have to say, it's incredible. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's not very often we get to see the style, aesthetic and mood of a game put into another game (I mean, how often does that really happen?) but I really think the FFXIV team 100% nailed the look and atmosphere of the NieR universe, it stands out as different than what we usually see in Final Fantasy bc it's metallic and gritty, and expansive in an uncomfortable way, not in the lush expansive fields way. 

&amp;#x200B;

And holy shit, the ongoing story with 2P and 9S was incredible to see, along with seeing all the robot enemies from Automata make appearances as boss fights and trash mobs. I raided a little bit in World of Warcraft but nothing in that game ever made me feel like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

fcyava,CivilizedPsycho,I had the strangest experience last night in Limsa.,"I had the craziest experience in FFXIV last night. I've been told not to go to Limsa after 9pm, but I did, and this is what happened.

So I'm in Limsa and I'm about to teleport to the South Shroud to do a fishing quest, but I get interrupted by a trade request.

This random woman stopped my teleport and traded me 1 Gil. I played it up and thanked her for her generosity and did the stepdance emote, she starts showering me with coins.

Then a tall man in an afro runs up, named Bobobobobobobo runs up and does a trade request as well.

So Bobo trades me an item called ""Coke"" and a Lalafell runs up and asks ""did you just give him what I think you gave him?""

This lalafell then asks me to cry for him, so I do /cry.

He IMMEDIATELY trades me 500k gil.Another person runs up and everyone starts dancing, announcing that we are the anime squad, while the original woman showers us with coins. She then traded me a random fish and a few more single gil.

That was so bizarre, it was the highlight of my night. Hysterical.

fcy4ri,LordJunon,Any Mass Effect players? I came up with a weird theory combining both games.,"So I've been playing through the mass effect trilogy for the 6th time, and this time I thought of a weird lore theory that combines both universes, I posted this on twitter, and i'm gonna xpost it a couple places on here and facebook but it seemed like something fun:

(Pardon any spelling mistakes or things like that)

Amarout was destroyed by the reapers. It just makes sense, the patterns of destruction and fear are there. And when Emet Selch greets you he even says..

“The Fabric of our star began to fade, and its energy begat malformed beasts” (sic) 

Well malformed beasts are reapers, and this could of been 100s of thousands ago so it could of been one of the early cycles, and reapers could of looked differently back then..

and when you get to the first fight he also says “Just as prayer brings forth primals, our dread manifested it self” (sic)

Well, dread last time I looked thats basically indocrination.

then after the second boss fight, you are transported to above the star.

Emet then says “We saw the star fading we had to weave its laws anew” (sic)

reapers can destroy stars, so this could of been part of their invasion.

The final boss could of been an early form of the Harvester enemy.

And when you look down you see the planet exploding much like Earth/Palaven/Thessia when they get attacked in the game. 

Anyways, thats my goofy theory, something fun to think about in this weird times, I've been thinking about this for a while (and when I saw Amarout it was the first thing I thought of, but now that I've been playing through ME again, this goofy thing popped into my head.",10,1583256915,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcy4ri/any_mass_effect_players_i_came_up_with_a_weird/,ffxiv,1
fcxst2,harukoa,Am I the only one that just absolutely sucks at Anamnesis Anyder?,"No story spoilers but dungeon mechanic spoilers.

For some reason I cannot get through this dungeon without dying once, making it more stressful is the fact I play healer, so generally if I die, we all die. It's not the mobs that get me, rather the bosses and their mechanics. The second boss I find myself screwing up on less now, mostly because the pattern is easy to remember and I started paying attention to the names of the attacks, but the first boss I have yet to not die too. Maybe I'm just a dumb bitch, when he does the mechanic where the AOE bubbles are thrown down and the arrow starts moving around, I find myself panicking because my dumb lizard brain says ""AOE BAD"" but running through them to a safe spot away from the arrow is what I should be doing.

fcv9lx,Sinnafein,Is there any better way to find decent pugs in FFXIV?,"So, I'm going to be honest, PUG'ing in FFXIV without tools like [Raider.IO](https://Raider.IO) is toxic as hell and I don't know what I can do about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I play FFXIV as a secondary game which leads to me not having a static; thus I have to PUG a lot. I managed to finally get my Ruby Weapon clear last Sunday (week 1) and it was one of the worst and least fun experiences I'd ever had in any game.... but I stuck it out, figured that once I got seven people who weren't braindead I'd get my clear and enter the world of non-braindead clear parties. Oh, how naive I was. I forgot that, unlike in WoW, people can clear on one class then use their duty complete status to run it on alts.

&amp;#x200B;

Legitimate... if I, as a DRK tank, outDPS one more god damned RDM or BLM I'm gonna lose my shit, tell them they're trash and just eat my ban. Say what you want about the ""toxic"" environment created by WoW's elitist community... at least it created the phenomenon of ""skill creep"" meaning that the average level of people is so so so sooooooooo much considerably higher than FFXIV. (That isn't to say PUG'ing in WoW is good, it has its own issues...)

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, how do you guys find successful PUGs? I can' seem to find non-retarded DPS to save my god damned life and, as a solo player, it's very very frustrating.",20,1583245425,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcv9lx/is_there_any_better_way_to_find_decent_pugs_in/,ffxiv,1

fcuqkm,hornager,Wall to walls in dungeons,"Recently had a discussion regarding this beet subject with my FC and I wanted to see what the opinion on wall to walling is from the playerbase. 

In case you have never heard of wall to wall, it is when the tank does pulls from the first possible time they can  to a physical barrier where they must stop ( literally a wall ). What this allows is for fast but harder dungeon clears, as everyone needs to be doing this job right. The tank needs to be cding , healers topping them off and DPS need to AoE everything. 


Personally, as a both a tank and a healer, I really enjoy doing wall to walls, as they let me run the dungeon fast and add some excitement to what I would consider a grind. As a tank, having all the mobs and surviving is satisfying,  and as a healer, healing wall to walls and making sure everyone survives is fun. 

I do  not advocate forcing wall to walls, bit you should talk with your group and see if you can attempt it. I know some people dont like the wall to wall mentality this game has, as it causes them more stress than they would like, and I can totally respect that. 

That being said, what is everyone opinions on wall to wall pulls ? Love them, hatem , or "" 1 group at a time= the best time "".",39,1583242992,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcuqkm/wall_to_walls_in_dungeons/,ffxiv,1

I recently put a post here about starting the game and I was told to take it slow and take in the story. A bit of background, im a competitive raider and PvPer in most games I play, I’ve reached top 10 EU kills and I tend to play 12 hours / day theorycrafting strats and raiding. 

This leads to me rushing so fast through content in MMOs that I don’t even understand the relevance of any fights or what I’m actually doing, just for the achievement and accomplishments, which worked fine for a few years. 

I decided to start FFXIV again after being burned out the first time round, there’s so many quests and I just didn’t feel anything which spamming ‘Skip Cutscene’ and missing all the text. 

This time round, I’ve decided to read all the story quests and take it slower.

Oh.
My.
God. 

I have NEVER felt immersed in a game before, but a character in the MSQ died recently and I physically felt upset. I actually didn’t want to continue the quest which was to move their body.

fcsnc8,brainburner1d10t,Clearing Ahead of Static/Weekly Chests/Yes/No?," TLDR; I'm hitting enrage in E8S and I really want to clear it today. However, my static meets tomorrow and it isn't a sure thing whether or not we'd clear E7S and the next meet up time is Sunday.

My plan is to finish E5-7S then prog/clear E8S immediately today.

For other statics out there, would you kick out a member for progging ahead of the group and getting the E8S clear and also finishing the other three floors before them for the week? (Making it so that they'd either get only 1 chest or have to replace a member)

Keep in mind it would only be this week and next week I'd just chill since I'd be content with having cleared and loot isn't too important to me. (Also should note they told me not to deny them on chests last week as well and I listened, to the detriment of my progging).",26,1583231187,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcsnc8/clearing_ahead_of_staticweekly_chestsyesno/,ffxiv,1

You think it unfair that you are subject to wipes? That your uptime will be sacrificed for the clear? Look at me! I have fought a thousand *THOUSAND* of your lockouts! I have crafted with you, fought with you, learned with you, wiped with you! Made diagrams, and yes called the entire fight. 

For eons I have measured your worth and found you wanting! Too weak and feeble-minded to clear *any* fight! Have your recent spats with Ramuh and his lightning taught you nothing? Have you not learned that your ignorance and frality beget only endless wipes?  How long do you mean to perpetuate this farce? How much more must I endure your bumbling ignorance? 

Let us imagine that the days of living liquid return to us, and all statics face true annihilation.  Do you honestly believe that you could clear the fight? OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T!

I like that fact that their power is grown with knowledge and that they use a book to cast spells.  It’s just a cool lore.  Gameplay wise, I like the complexity of the rotation and the cool summons.  Reminds me of doctor strange.  I think if we are talking Myers Briggs, then this class also clicks with me as an INTJ.

fcngwb,Alkrow,Please help me with choosing my class.,"Sorry in advance if I'll annoy some of you. I get it that those post can be annoying but I really need help and wasn't really sure where to ask.

First of, I played a lot of Gw2 (like weekly raid full clear and daily fractal cm's, most liked class weaver) and some wow. So I basically have some experience in mmorpgs in general.

Ffxiv I started with a friend of mine, he was playing black mage and I played paladin.
We both played to level 64 and then I had to take a break because of personal life, and he just played to lvl 70 and waited for me.

The thing is now, I would like to swap back to playing dps because that's basically the role I love most in those games, and I want to experience raids etc. First as a dps, because if I fail at that it won't be as bad as if I fail as a tank while learning the basics of those raids etc.
I'm gonna admit I had a hard time going forward blind as a tank with tank swapping and all of that stuff because I'm generally new to tank. And even though people were amazingly understanding and sweet trying to explain mechanics and stuff I felt bad

So I looked around and basically the 2dps classes which looked coolest to me were either dancer or summoner. It would be really cool if you could try to help me decide between those 2.
Things like, will I be able to get into groups with the class, How high is the skill ceiling, etc. Would generally help me a ton.

fcn8ao,Euthorix,New character or new game plus?,"Hello,

I just recently got into FFXIV and made the mistake of skipping all the cutscenes, all the story dialogue, everything. Now that I am level 54 on my main job, I am starting to regret that decision and am wondering if I should keep playing this character, skipping cutscenes, etc until I have the ability to do new game+ (I currently do not have that option) or if I should just outright make a new character?

Basically, I am concerned if I try and start following the story from where I'm at now (Post base game credits, I believe) that I will get confused and in a way spoil things for myself, at the same time I don't know how much more I have left until I can do NG+. 

Additional question, does NG+ involve everything? There was a goofy quest line I did that rewarded me with an outfit and a wind up butler looking guy that I kinda wish I paid attention to.

So, ideas?",11,1583200575,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcn8ao/new_character_or_new_game_plus/,ffxiv,1

fci8hu,chobotong,DX11 game crashing issues,"Hey all.

So I've been playing XIV for about 2 weeks now and I'm in the middle of stormblood. Yesterday, during a 2 hour play session, I made it to the azim steppes and my game crashed at the loading screen with no error message. I've been dcing instantly upon logging in with my toon thereafter. To clarify, I did not install any new software or update any existing software throughout that play session.

I've tried switching to dx9 and this lets me play for about 10-15minutes before I dc again with no error message. I've been doing this for awhile and reached a quest with a cutscene that just won't load at all, even on dx9. As such, I'm completely unable to progress the MSQ since running the game with dx9 just leads me to an endless loading screen for the cutscene whereas dx11 crashes the game the moment i log in with my character.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried:

\- Reinstalling the game;

\- Creating a new character to see if for some reason this problem is character/zone specific;

\- Ensuring that the game is run as admin;

\- Compatibility mode from windows 8 to windows 7;

\- Updating all my drivers; and,

\- Checking for updates on windows and running said updates.

&amp;#x200B;

None of these have worked for me so far. Does anyone have any experience with similar issues?

fci49m,unlimitedblack,Guy (FF2) and Gau (FF6) as Bearers of the Echo,"Okay, come with me on this journey:

Krile (FF5) was said to be ""able to speak the language of beasts"" which is how she could do cool things like chat with moogles and wyverns. In XIV, Krile Mayer Baldesion mirrors aspects of the FFV Krile's design, but also wields that same ability to understands beasts by possessing the Echo. Tenzen, a key character in the backstory for the Four Lords narrative in Stormblood, possessed this power as well, leading the Scions to speculate that he possessed the Echo as well.

Guy, one of the core party members of FF2, was also supposed to have this ability to understand beasts. And Gau from FF6, while not directly stated to have that ability, seemingly has it to some extent by virtue of his ability to mimic the abilities of monsters through his Rages. 

An element that these two have in common from their narratives is that both of them are effectively orphans who were raised in the wild, which owes to their awkwardness and plays into their affinity for animals in general. Guy, while physically intimidating, has a gentle spirit, and text for FF2 characterized him has being ""simple"" in his speech, suggesting a lack of facility for human speech. He is, however, adopted by Maria's family (which had already adopted Firion) which gives him a perfectly fine home to grow up in until the Empire comes and wrecks the place. 

Gau's father goes insane and casts the boy out as a child, leading him to be raised by the monsters of the Veldt. Similar to Ultimately Gau attaches himself to Sabin's quest to fight the Empire and save the world, but comes to think of the heroes as a new family. 

Another thing that's common between Guy's and Gau's narratives is that they both come from games where the conflict isn't directly related to the Crystals. Both, however, deal with the conflict between Light and Darkness in different ways:

* Guy, Firion and Maria ultimately kill Emperor Mateus, who rises as the Dark Emperor. In Soul of Rebirth, we see several of Team Firion's allies in the world of the dead fighting against the ""Light Side"" of the Emperor, and it takes defeating both sides to truly bring the threat of Mateus to an end. 
* Gau and the hero team in FF6 contend against the power of the Empire and ultimately the Warring Triad, but finally have to fight against Kefka, who has wrapped himself in all of the imagery of Light, even as he harnesses it as a destructive force that gives him dominion over the world. 

In both cases (though somewhat delayed in the Soul of Rebirth case), Light is something that is as dangerous and threatening a force as Darkness. So the notion that Guy and Gau, as Bearers of the Echo, would be forced to fight against the Light, either directly or indirectly, strikes me as interesting. 

This isn't intended to be speculation about future crossovers with XIV -- more just a matter of certain threads coming together and a cross-analysis of the games that, through the lens of XIV, creates an interesting scenario in my mind.",6,1583179892,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fci49m/guy_ff2_and_gau_ff6_as_bearers_of_the_echo/,ffxiv,1

fcgyl3,bigguccisosaxx,This game is fun!,"I started playing 2 months ago and so far made it to heavenswars lvl 57 MSQ. Before this I played GW2 and before that a very little bit of WoW.
I have to say this game is on another level.

Ok, main story absolutely sucked up until near the end of ARR. However, not skipping cutscenes and paying some attention to characters really paid off. I'm very much enjoying the story now.

I really like dungeons, trials and alliance raids. They are fun. Unfortunately I had to do synced 8 man raid and lvl 80 guys just carried me.

But my absolutely favorite thing are high end trials. Couple of them I first did through duty finder to finish the quest quickly and it was very unsatisfying. However, I just love doing them through the duty finder. It's a challenge, dynamic, fun, and always different experience. Since I'm a healer and queue for 5 trials at the same time, queue time is very low.

Yes, 50% of the time the trials fail, but this doesn't make the trials any less fun. I love having this challenge and seeing how it's easy or impossible based on the random group I get. It's just ton of fun. There are so many things I like about this game, but high end trials are number 1.

With the expansions and stuff, I can see this game giving me at least a year, maybe more of absolute fun. Was definitely worth getting it!",14,1583175523,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcgyl3/this_game_is_fun/,ffxiv,1

Unless you're an NPC.

NPCs are allowed whatever the heck they want.  Two 4 star cards?  Sure!  A 5 star and a 4 star?  Of course!  Any combination is open to you!

fcg6uc,gistofeverything,AMA - The Balance,"Hello Warriors of Darkness!

As a subreddit, we have invited a few community figureheads to use our platform to answer some of your burning questions in the past, such as [MrHappy](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/a81uhy/ama_mrhappy/), [Ariyala](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3psv48/ama_ariyalas_ffxiv_toolkit/), and [Aetherflow Media](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/azvt92/ama_aetherflow_media/). This time, we have invited a few key members of [The Balance](https://discord.gg/thebalanceffxiv) to do an AMA with us.

For those not aware,  The Balance is a learning hub and repository of resources for players of all walks of life. They pride themselves in the currency of their resources and the testing rigour to which they are subject. They have role- and job-dedicated chats allowing players to socialise and ask questions of each other to seek clarity, and they actively encourage and help all of their users to be the best players they can be.  

Below is a short introduction from each of the staff members that will be participating in the panel:

* u/theholl0wstar \- I'm Skye, I play on Gilgamesh. My IGN is Skye Minami.    
I'm one of the two founders of The Balance - Back when it was just called the 'FFXIV Job Server' (yes, that was its initial name). I don't do much of day-to-day moderation anymore- I prefer to let the mods handle most situations unless I feel the need to step in because the punishment wasn't quite what it should have been. I mostly tend to take care of the ""background"" things. Picking out mentors, making new tools to ease the lives of our moderators, etc.     
I'm also a trash dragoon player who lives in party finder so, some of you may have seen me there. 
* u/flowerpetal_ \- I'm Lyra Rose. I'm one of the three Head Admins of the Balance, and have previously been a Ranged as well as a Crafting/Gathering mentor. My role at the Balance is basically that of a creative director - I oversee the creation of Balance resources, check over guides and pins, and create encounter guides. In-game, I raid every tier, I have many many alts and I co-lead the Lighthouse FC on Gilgamesh. 
* u/BongoCatFFXIV \- I am Bongo Cat from Ultros and moderator of the Balance. I like catgirls and gacha games.  I began playing FFXIV at the end of Sigma and really got into raiding shortly after I began playing. I'm mostly a PLD one-trick but have been trying to break that these past couple months. Most of my time in the server is spent shitposting, but when I do actually do mod stuff, I like to spend time in the tank channels and other general channels within the Balance. I like to talk a lot. 
* u/pomegranated \- i'm alice, i play on sargatanas   
my ign is unpronounceable so I don't even try myself.. I am a filthy casual raidlogger and I don't really help with anything but I exist and people listen to me sometimes... most recently I have been telling people to read pins and resources over in blm channels 
* u/lindfeldt \- i'm sierra, i currently play on tonberry.   
trans uni student and journeyman raider. also a big female au ra enthusiast. ast then smn main in creator, brd main all of omega, and now gnb main. i help with the active moderation of the balance channels and assist with gnb theorycrafting whenever it is needed, and i also spend some of my free time curating gnb resources for the balance.    
most recently i have contributed to bis number-crunching for gnb in particular and am currently in the process of updating the general gnb guide for patch 5.2. 

Feel free to ask The Balance any questions you might have. We'll leave this open for questions until the rate of submissions slows down a lot. Each of the staff members have been given a unique user flair to help more easily identify them as staff members of The Balance.",290,1583172632,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcg6uc/ama_the_balance/,ffxiv,1
fcg6t9,pablm4,BLM vs SMN balance,"Bored at work so let's chat about the current balance between BLM and SMN. In this tier, median SMNs are performing pretty considerably better than median BLMs, but top tier BLMs are still a step ahead of top tier SMNs. I'm curious what people think of that balance given the rotational, mechanical and utility differences between the two classes. Do y'all think BLM needs a potency buff or its mana shift utility back? Maybe another instant proc to deal with movement? Do you think SMN is overtuned?

As a BLM I've always been cool with SMN doing great damage because of how much more mechanically difficult their rotation is and their rez utility, but I've also seen lots of people saying that serious groups have no business taking a BLM if a SMN is available.",25,1583172628,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcg6t9/blm_vs_smn_balance/,ffxiv,1

fcfs21,Krazy__Tom,"After buying the base game on Steam, will it upgrade my existing account with the DLC the base game comes with?","I got the game many years ago through a friend before the game was on Steam and I only played the free month and the account doesn't have Heavensward and Stormblood.

I would like to get back in the game but play through Steam.

I read I could buy the Steam version, not use the registration key, and log in with my existing account. However, like I said, my existing account doesn't have the 2 DLCs that the base game comes with when I buy the Steam version. 

I thought about cancelling my Square Enix account and making a new account through Steam as it will have the 2 DLCs in the base game where as my current account doesn't have them (as far as I know). When I went through the process of cancelling the Square Enix account, I was warned that, if I wanted to create a new account, I couldn't use the same e-mail address or the account ID.

I would prefer to not use a different e-mail address or ID.

So, if buying the Steam version could upgrade my existing account with the 2 DLC, that would be great. However, if I buy the game and find that can't happen, that would mean I would have wasted money and time. Steam specifically states that the game CANNOT be refunded. I haven't bought the game yet.

Please let me know if what I am asking is possible.

If there are any alternatives to achieve what I am trying to do, if this is a lost cause, please provide your knowledge. Just remember the main goal is to play through Steam. I am willing to adjust, I just want to make sure if I can do these things first.",12,1583171058,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcfs21/after_buying_the_base_game_on_steam_will_it/,ffxiv,1

The only explanations I can think of is that either Echo-jacking an incarnate summoning (when the summoner physically becomes the primal itself) is impossible, or that Shinryu was a special case that was uniquely weak willed due to its one-dimensional nature as a mindless incarnation of destruction. Either way, the implication I get from this is that Zenos’ plan to take control of Zodiatk or Hydaelyn and have the WoL do the same with the other was doomed from the start.

fcdsny,seaniewalsh,What FFXIV song really pulls it all together for you?," [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saYCZ9jzLEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saYCZ9jzLEA) 

The first time I played the &gt;!Titantia trial!&lt; I was blown away by it's song. Not only did it feel super unique in the world of video game music, but it just pulled me in so hard immersion wise. It felt like the kind of track that the boss would actually generate to make the fight more enjoyable within the game world. I especially love the sweet sounding vocal element, which lyrically remind me of some Red Hot Chili Peppers esque lyrical gibberish.

What about you? What song do you have on repeat via Youtube right now? What gets your blood pumping when it turns on? Or brings you into the fantasy world of Eorzea?",102,1583163422,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fcdsny/what_ffxiv_song_really_pulls_it_all_together_for/,ffxiv,1

Some are probably just MSQ-based, but here we go for as far as I know or guess:  


Sultana: Probably MSQ?  


First Sword of the Gladiator's Guild: Probably or rather most likely Gladiatior Questline  


A culinary magician: Most likely Culinary Questline  


Ul'dah's top songstresses: You probably had to do the Event last year for this one  


A legendary aesthetician: There is this Level 15 Quest in Limsa with him, but I can remember he was also in another Questline... but maybe the Level 15 one is enough to get  Jandelaine  


Little Dragon Friend: You need to complete the Sidequestline ""When Mother Calls"" in the Dravavian Forelands from Gullinkambi at 16/23 for that option to appear. Just did that and it worked.  


Someone with deep pockets: The Namazou Sidequest which starts with ""Perchance to Hanami"" at 30/18 in Yanxia. At least it should be this one, since the Namazou in question appears there. Probably linked to the unlocking of the Beast-Tribe anyways, but can not remember anymore.

fcap75,druiddesign,Adventure Ideas,"I like to do random things of adventure sometimes just for the sake of interactivity with the game world.  Does anyone have some unique suggestions?

Some of my favorites:

\- Make random armor sets, find adventurer who is appropriate level for them and (usually) a sprout, give them armor set.  Combat, or crafter/gatherer stuff works.  It's useful and very appreciated always.  Finding the person to give it to can be a challenge which is what makes this an adventure :)

\- Pick a quest hub and people watch.  It's super interesting to just see the game world activity.  Might be boring to some people, but I like it. You get to see some interesting glams in random places other than duty finder (looking at you MSQ roulette)

Is there a general rule of thumb people follow when levelling their gatherers because there is just too much specific time-locked shit and I can’t figure out an even semi-efficient way to go forward.

A couple of examples, I was curious what the little red pins scattered around the map indicated. I scoured the internet for it, and turned up no information about what they represent. Not even acknowledgement that they exist. The closest confirmation I got was ""map red pins ffxiv"" coming up as a suggested search term, confirming others have looked it up as well.

Currently, I'm in Ul'Dah and there is strange music playing I've never heard before, and I could be mistaken, but there seem to be a lot of cherry blossoms around town I never noticed before. Nothing online about it, and digging too deep starts uncovering spoilers.

While I do understand that  killing the same mob with different exp bonuses (153%+ vs 173%+), I used this number to calculate the base exp of the mobs, and it turns out to be different. As an example, killing the first mob in Great Gubal Library with 173% bonus gives me 15552 exp, while at 153% bonus gives me 14410 exp. Respectively, the calculated base exp for this mob is 8990 exp and 9418 exp.

I'm interested in whether if this is due to mobs giving less exp the more outlevelled you are for that dungeon, as these two runs of the dungeon were done on my DRK at different levels.

I started trying to clear Hades EX on Saturday last weekend out of boredom, but ended up getting super obsessed with beating the fight. After 7 days of trying, since I took Thursday off, we finally beat him this Saturday. Super fun fight, didn't get any important drops but I wasn't in it for the drops, I was in it to kick his ass. 

Ended up building a discord of roughly 30 people by now for raiding on Crystal data center over the process of this whole thing, so I met a bunch of friendly people, had a great time. Not proud to say it but I neglected more than a few homework assignments for this too. So this week, I'm catching up on school work, then it's into the Eden Savage raids (in order for the sake of mental health lol) with my group. If anyone plays on Crystal data center and wants to join the fiesta, shoot me a message, the more the merrier after all.

Im so fecking bad its embarassing. I struggle so hard to keep everything in line with BLM and do the movements. DPS is beyond shit and it felt not good.
So i tried something else and started Redmage. Just 62 now but it feels so insanely chill compared to BLM? There is nothing i have to keep an eye on. Just pressing the glowy buttons and do some stabbing if the manabars are right and damge seems very good.

fc836h,-Zextras-,Constant crashes prevent me from playing -- What else can I try in order to fix it?,"Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I started having issues with the game when I noticed my frame rate was around half whatever I set the cap to in the in-game settings. This means if I set it to cap at 60 then the game would run from 20-30 but if I set it to 120 then the game would run at 50-60. I decided that the best fix for this issue would be to set it to ""uncapped"" *(at which point it would give me \~190 FPS which caused unnecessary heat, therefore noise making my fans run louder)* and use Nvidia Control Panel to cap it at 60 instead, this worked until about 2 days ago I have started having issues with the game randomly crashing, some times with an error report and other times without.

&amp;#x200B;

[**This is the error message I am receiving.**](https://imgur.com/a/xsFgxLX) 

&amp;#x200B;

I have found many other people with the same issue but none of the fixes seem to have helped at all. The things I have tried so far include:

* Reverting all settings back to default, including those in Nvidia Control Panel
* Disabling Steam overlay
* Disabling Windows Game Bar and DVR
* Disabling Discord overlay
* Disabled G-Sync
* Played in both DX9 and DX11 *(The error stays the same but instead just says ""ffxiv.exe"" instead of ""ffxiv\_dx11.exe"")*
* Disabled fullscreen optimizations in the windows compatibility menu *(*[*seen here*](https://imgur.com/a/ctpdvld)*)*
* Used DDU to wipe all GPU drivers from my system before installing only the most recent
* Tried in windowed, windowed fullscreen and fullscreen
* Reinstalled the game

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional information that might be helpful:

* I always have iCUE, MSI Afterburner and Discord running
* I have tried all fixes one at a time to try and narrow it down
* I have tried a mixture of some fixes as well as all together
* FF14 Is the only game with these issues
* I run the game through Steam
* I play the game with MAX settings
* Temperatures rarely go above 60c even under load *(such as in busy cities with many, many players)*
* **The crashes are completely random.** Sometimes I can be playing for a couple hours before it happens and other times it can happen within 5 minutes of launch. Location, work load and temperature seem to have no determinable effect on when or why it crashes.

fc7dy2,TosinABossSi,Concerned about 50/60/70 dungeons/raids.,"I just beat the base game for MSQ. I've done Castrum twice and Praetorium once, and everything dies so fast that they didn't present a challenge, and it was difficult to appreciate the experience of the fights. This got me concerned for future dungeons/raids.

I would like to do literally all the dungeons/raids for levels 50/60/70. I think the duty roulette is an incredible idea as it allows new players to do dungeon/raid content with older players, and using the item sync level as balance. 

However, there are a lot of experienced players who are decked out in very good gear, and the item sync level can only do so much. 

My question is: How frequent and difficult will all future dungeons/raids be up to 80? Will the majority of them be a similar experience like Castrum Meridianum and Praetorium?

Also important bonus question: If I chose a very specific dungeon, like say Stone Vigil (Hard), will I ONLY be able to play with players who have queued up for that exact dungeon? Or will the duty roulette disperse the players to help fill my group if my waiting time is too long or...?",34,1583127336,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fc7dy2/concerned_about_506070_dungeonsraids/,ffxiv,1

ARR's story is the number one deterrent I've had to get friends to play the game. They play for a few hours, if I'm lucky days, and can't seem to get into it.

fc0grk,HyurNational,(Spoilers) Elidibus' Plan,"He is holding the First hostage.

Option A

The Scions leave the First to help contain the destabilized Empire, which threatens to spill violence throughout the world. Zenos is back and extremely dangerous, per Estinien's report. Elidibus is then left alone to be able to continue to lead the new Warriors of Light on a doomed mission to ""save the world"" that he intends to Rejoin with the Source. Without resistance from the Scions, he will inevitably succeed.

Option B

The Source is left to Zenos and his new Ascian friend's devices, who may run rampant and cause immeasurable suffering with a decentralized Empire and its varying Legions fighting for dominance, while the Scions are stuck in a stalemate against Elidibus, who uses his influence to set the Warriors of Light against the Warriors of Darkness. All of which makes the process of getting the Scions back home harder and more dangerous, especially if the Exarch's efforts are disrupted.

Either way, Elidibus gets what he wants. The First's Rejoining or his people's greatest enemy since the Final Days weakened by taking down his support network.",34,1583096044,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fc0grk/spoilers_elidibus_plan/,ffxiv,1

fbxvey,exosion,"Μy experience with the story so far, and my thoughts, WARNING huge spoilers up to 1st part of Stormblood (and a Full Metal Alchemist reference)","I played PLD up to 50, then RDM, healed all grp content as AST for fast queues

I am at the point right after beating Sharingan Zenos/Shinryu 

**I will complain a bit but dont get me wrong, game is amazing**

So the ARR slogfest was... boring to say the least, its unfortunate that in order to fully experience the game and connect with the characters you have to watch at least some key parts

I understand they plan to fix that, but most likely they will just trim some back &amp; forth and not overhaul the story

The ""Red Banquet"" was amazing by itself though, the ""side quests"" of investigating the missing weapons that led nowhere and the setup with the vial was a nice misdirection as I thought there would be follow up, nope.

Telehi straight gets murdered and I loved that

**Heavensward was a massive improvement overall, my few complaints:**

Haurchefant death was good although a bit predictable as was Moenbryde, its like they where setup to be dramatic martyrs

Ysayle death was ok'ish

The female dragon surviving corrupt Estinien attack during the peace ceremony ""with just a scratch"" was meeeeh (off screen mention too)

It would be amazing to setup an angry Hraeslver and his trial to overcome 

I felt that Estinien should have died at the end also with the whole self sacrifice fitting (awesome scene opportunity to reveal his face too)

Aymeric actually surviving all the way to the end was suprising 

I lol'd at the dinner where the WoL was staring the wine butler, after having already two back to back incidents 

**My major complaints up to that point:**

Everyone of the Scions including Nanamo (she SHOULD have just died there wth) surviving the banquet made the entire banquet cheap imho

Thancred became more cool and Y'shtola  ""blind with benefits"",

 seems like no one other than Matoya noticed that

**On to Stormblood:**

Not much to say, the best parts where: 

Ilberd death and cutscene with Omega was VERY good

Papalymo ""sacrifice"" (not sure he is dead as it was offscreen) and Yda/Lyse reveal was good too

Zenos was meh at first (typical anime villain) but eventually he won me, his phrase ""Time between the seconds"" has a nice ring to it

I would prefer a different look though

Doma areas and pacing where very nice, the normal combat/area music was very repetitive though, mainly cause Gyr Abania has the same combat music too for some reason and Kugane and other areas have same rythm

I feel underwater stuff was underutilized too, but I am not done with Stormblood yet

Susano fight good, had a whipe due to dps, game gets serious :)

Nadaal (tribal proving grounds) was awesome

Ala Mhigo dungeon Zenos fight surprised me, so far it was the ONLY part in entire game where we wiped not once but 3 times till we get it right


**And now my major complaints**

Does anyone important actually die???!!!

Conrad death was ok but expected

The dude who died fighting Fordola (forgot his name) too

The fact Gosetsu (and Yotsuyu but mainly him) survived ruined what emotions where built up to that point

Y'shtola survived the Zenos slash too and Krile was just enjoying a nap apparently

There was a part where you fight a monster screaming ""come get medicine"" and after defeating it and leaving the room the camera panned and focused on its dead body for some intriguing reason

I was half expecting a Full Metal Alchemist ""Edward..."" moment that never came (would be awesome though)

I mean I understand plot armor but ffs really, there is so much potential for well played drama here

At this point I stop taking deaths seriously tbh",7,1583085912,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbxvey/μy_experience_with_the_story_so_far_and_my/,ffxiv,1

My other 80 class is astrologian, but I don't like healing unless I already have some experience with these fights. 

I like ninja, but that I knew there was never much hope that I would get good enough for difficult content. Luckily the class changed a lot recently, but it's hard for me to say how challenging the class is atm.

Another class I happened to like and already have on level 71 is dragoon. Still need some more Pratice with juggling the different OGCD skills but it seems manageable.

As for spell caster, summoner is supposed to be really tough, so not for me and Red mage doesn't really appeal to me. I do like black mage and I know it has a easy rotation, but is hard to master, which scares me a little away from the class. Since I currently have no plans to do savage content, I'm fine with not Bron 100% optimized, but I also don't want to feel like a burden on the team.

I heard dancer is pretty easy, but I know little about this class. Machinist also seems interesting, but I don't know much them either.",15,1583082777,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbx2tr/struggling_with_monk_looking_for_a_new_class_to/,ffxiv,1

I decided to leaving raiding behind and don't complete savage content anymore but I do like extreme content, I like the whole DDR routine as I'm fairly good at repetitive content. I've learned to do extreme content either with some friends who already know what an asshole I am or *unplug my keyboard* (I play with controller).

Crafting is my main thing though and since the beginning of time, as far as I can remember a lot of my crafting has required tome items and this is why I'm thankful. I can now farm the latest dungeon as much as I like and lash out as much as I like at Thancred, Alisaie and Ryne any fear of backlash and still get my tomes at the end of the dungeon.

fbufrb,BigArseTrees,"Failed to buy house, where did I go wrong?","Hi all. Me and friends recently made our own FC and began our house hunt. We got to rank 6, got the gil, found a plot. This plot was in Gridania, amazing view, location, everything. We learnt the hard way about the crappy housing system, so we camped by the post for over 8 hours until a friend made a macro so we could actually sleep.

I was given temporary master so it was in my hands to make sure it all worked. I gave to the gil to the friend with the macro, made him officer and enabled permission for officers to purchase land.

Well I wake up this morning to find that it shortly became available after I went to sleep and that it wasn't letting him buy it due to his rank. Needless to say, a random had claimed the spot some hours after and now I'm left feeling like an absolute let down and heartbroken. I had a gut feeling before leaving that I should've made him master but I didn't want to upset our leader by doing that. 

Double checking and officers definitely had permission to buy the land. I'd also read that officers can indeed buy the FC house as long as we're rank 6 and they have the permission. So...what exactly went wrong?",10,1583071382,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbufrb/failed_to_buy_house_where_did_i_go_wrong/,ffxiv,1

What if, similar to Dalmasca and Ivalice on The Source, different Final Fantasy regions/worlds existed as their own separate approximations on each Shard? 

While the FFX Spira obviously wouldn't be in FFXIV, just like FFTactics Ivalice wouldn't exist in FFXIV, it would be interesting if an FFXIV-ified Spira was the southern region of the Eastern continent, equivalent to where Ivalice would be on The Source.

When i would be doing stuff solo in the world i'd just press shift + 2 so i dont have to keep holding control to reach skills on hotbar 2.

But on my more recent alt this function thats on by deffault is not on at all and i can't seem to find it in the settings anywhere. When i press shift + 2 it does not change to hotbar 2 but rather uses the skill thats on the second spot of hotbar 1. 

I've breen through the settings so many times now and i really can't seem to fix this issue im having. Does anyone know how to make it function like described?

Is it unrealistic to expect a clear on a first lockout? I mean you already watched a guide so you should know how to do all those mechanics perfectly.

Game looks cool and i have few questions

Does it matter if i use the launcher or steam version? Because steam complete edition is cheaper compred to the one in sqaure website?

What will i get from the complete edition in terms of ingame comtent? I see some races and classes not abailable to me because its locked?

Which eu realm is better to join?
I heard some servers got the exp buff(until lvl70) and players say the buff is great but i will out level most quests because of it so i need a realm without this buff?

I can decide on a starting class-sadly the only one handed sword class is samurai which is locked until lvl 50 -/- does it mean i need to open a random class and then change it to samurai at lvl 50? I also wanted to try Bard/Archer but they say its one of the weakest for raids and other content.. so i'm not sure what to do.. maybe dragoon! But they use spears and not 1handed swords

fbrb4x,Throwaway-When-Done,Are there any guides for mounts and minions that are organized by the order in which they become accessible?,"I've been enjoying the vast, vast amount of resources online for FFXIV and I've had a question pop up. I've come across lots of great glossaries of mounts and minions, many of which share how you unlock them.

However, there are so, *so* many of them that I'm a bit overwhelmed. Reading through the As alone can take up quite a bit of your time, only for you to realize you don't have access to any of them yet.  I'm wondering if there are any guides out there that organize the mounts and minions by the order in which they become available (for example, putting the coeurl kitten minion higher up on the list since that is available early into the game) instead of alphabetically.

[Here's](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Guide:Progression_and_Level_Locked_Content) a handy example of the sort of the thing I'm interested in (if incomplete). 

I wouldn't be averse to a guide that includes things beyond mounts and minions that I should be sure not to miss. Mainly looking to maximize my play time by doing side quests that give good rewards and unlock fun things, though I completely understand the completionists who enjoy doing everything. :)",2,1583051935,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbrb4x/are_there_any_guides_for_mounts_and_minions_that/,ffxiv,1
fbr4q9,Abalieno,Seeking details on Main Scenario simplification (because I don't want it),"I want to experience everything as originally intended. Ideally this condensed main quest coming next patch is kept optional, but I'm sure it won't be and that part of the game will be gone.

But I don't have a lot of time to allocate to the game, so even if I'm trying to put some hours here and there I don't think I'll be able to get very far before next patch arrives. This is quite stressful. 

I'm just level 15 and trying to keep up with two jobs at once, and also enjoy side quests, gathering and everything.

So, I'm wondering if there are some more specific details about how this is going to work. How much is going to be removed, to what part of the game. I've read long ago it's mainly between base game and Heavensward, but maybe it will be more widespread, or be progressively extended.

If only I knew this was optional I could play A LOT more relaxed, and have more fun.

I've tried to adjust slightly so I'm standing a bit behind the line/safe spot as it seems I'm not getting pushed back far enough to avoid the trample. But even that's not consistently helped me avoid them or i just get knocked off the edge.

fbp65k,Ethanator72,An odd problem where I lost progress?,"This is my first post and if I place this in the wrong spot or mark it wrong, I'll do my best to fix it. So I've tried looking up this problem for  a little while now (past few hours) but haven't had any luck finding anything on it. I made my character a while ago (months ago) so that's when I first started playing but then got distracted with other games and life related things so I put the game down for quite a while, but I began picking it back up again with some friends today. I logged in, figured out some friends of mine are on a different server so I transferred server and all that was fine and good BUT I seemed to have lost progress somehow but I don't think it's related to server transfer because my character didn't change before or after the transfer.  


I can't say for sure where I was, but I'll do my best to describe what I do remember, but this is from memory so it may be vague so my apologies if it sounds ridiculous and I don't have names as I never really got very far (max i got too was around 30). I remember having my chocobo (no not the chocobokeep, I mean the one you get from the grand company as I remember I joined originally), I remember doing a haunted mansion theme dungeon in a forest area, I remember fighting Ifrit as part of the story. These are what I remember immediately but I'm sure there's more.  


I'm not sure why this happened and I checked before the server transfer (diabolos to gilgamesh) and I didn't lose any progress in the transfer because my character was the same before as it was after when logging in for the first time today. I've been playing a majority of the day and I just fought ifrit again through the story and I'm about to choose my grand company again, but I'm wondering if there is a way to get my progress back other then doing it over. I know its an odd problem and I don't imagine there would be anything to do but I'm out of ideas and wondering if this has happened to anyone else.",4,1583038398,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbp65k/an_odd_problem_where_i_lost_progress/,ffxiv,1
fbovpb,sillieranimal1,Is there a curse that makes it where you cant find a decent party for literally anything semi-challenging?,"I've been trying to gather a party to do Hades ex for the last like, 2 weeks.  I'm specifically dps the entire time because I do not trust myself to tank, and people have tanked longer than me and can do it better.  Yet no matter what party I make, I've never had a single party were everyone knew what they were doing. 

The very first party I ever had I made it to the final phase but we wiped and people had to leave, I've never been able to make back there in TWO WEEKS.  Two weeks of party after party and apparently no one on Aether except for a select few can actually beat the god damn thing.  Its gotten to the point where I honest to god should just wait for the next xpac so I can just unsync it with the bads.

This is kind of a rant but I need to know if I'm the only one who is experiencing this.  That you're basically just baby sitting 7 other idiots who DIDNT EVEN BOTHER WATCHING THE VIDEO.

I limit my FPS at 60 and can maintain stable FPS regardless of which settings are used, although I typically play on low just to keep my machine happy. I’ve never had any issues with performance and this seems to be one of the most optimized MMO’s I’ve ever played. However, since patch 5.2 my FPS has been sporadically spiking from 60 down to 20 and it happens quite often making the game unplayable. I have about 200 hours played and have never experienced anything like this until now. Just curious if this is something that has happened on my end or if this is perhaps a known issue.

Like last time, this version includes a bunch of refinements and additions in addition to including all the latest 5.20 game content.

We've overhauled gathering logs to include closest Aetheryte and map coordinates, and fishing logs have been redone to more closely match the logs in game (thanks AngloWarrior#3952).  We've also updated the Achievements tabs to match in game order to make it easier to update your progress each patch, and added an all new Travel section to track things like mount speed increases, Shared FATE ranks, Chocobo Porters unlocked, and Aether Currents (credit to Hot\_Cellar#9583).  Finally, this update also includes a rework of the Relic Weapons tab which is now included under Collectables.

As with each version update, there is a [change log](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zaM-XWPjVQdWjznj78UWk8JFimny32w5) available as well which highlights which tabs and cells have changed from the last version of the spreadsheet to this one.  This should help make things easier for anyone who was already using a previous version of the spreadsheet to update your tracker without having to re-enter all your data on the new version.

Links to older versions of the change log are available on our Discord.  Feel free to [join](https://discord.gg/NR86BUN) the project discord server or find us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/FFXIV100) as well!

fbmofl,MortaLPortaL,Considering buying FFXIV.,"I’m wondering if this would be a worthy purchase or not. I used to enjoy playing destiny 1/2 until 2 came out. I had so much trouble making friends, doing raids and group specific activities. Will I have any issues like that in this game? I’ve been playing FF for as long as I can remember, and I’ve seen some gameplay of this and it looks neat. I am unsure of the grind, because in destiny 2 you’d have to do the same events 20-30+ times to get a specific item and hope it has the roll you want. Is that something similar to FFXIV? 

My main concerns are; finding friends, getting things done and enjoying the game. Also If I did purchase, what should I look for and avoid as a beginner.

fbl82s,YukikoJJ,E5S 3-Person Chain Lightning Strat,"**Disclaimer: If this is something that is already being done, please let me know so I can delete this post, thanks :)**

So, I've been seeing a lot of parties on pf and a lot of groups in general doing the 3-person strat on pf, but people tend to die because they get too close or too far and they usually do it having one group east and the other west, which is annoying for healers (I assume).

Anyways, my group decided to do the 3-person strat but we changed it a little bit so we could get heals and have the minimal possibility of error.

https://preview.redd.it/3ax0yz5b7wj41.png?width=1102&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0467405d6e4bba1655c82108ac719ffbdbe3dd6

If you look at this picture (proportions are not perfect I know T.T), you will see you can put both tanks at north and just chill while the party goes to their group SW or SE. The only people that move are the ranged. That makes it so the only people responsible of movement and passing the chain are them. This also allows AoE healing to reach all people doing the mechanic. 

The passing goes H-M-R, with ranged then moving to south and then back north to wait until next pass.

Here is a clip of our first attempt doing this strat:

[https://www.twitch.tv/daintysquid/clip/FunSuspiciousOilChocolateRain](https://www.twitch.tv/daintysquid/clip/FunSuspiciousOilChocolateRain)

fbkj87,ShadesGuide,Shade's Guide update (Feb 29 2020),"# The crafter leveling guide:

Back in early January, I published a major update to the crafter leveling guide on my website:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/elx3ub/sg\_v30\_complete\_guide\_to\_crafter\_leveling\_leves/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/elx3ub/sg_v30_complete_guide_to_crafter_leveling_leves/) 

I've got some things to add to it (thanks for all the feedback, btw!), including the changes to Ishgardian Restoration collectables that the 5.2 patch brought. They'll be added soon!

&amp;#x200B;

# Youtube things:

Then, I made this update post last week to share my progress on my FFXIV settings video, which covers the System Configuration menu:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/f8i29z/sg\_ffxiv\_settings\_video\_guide\_in\_progress\_will\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/f8i29z/sg_ffxiv_settings_video_guide_in_progress_will_be/) 

It's coming along very well, but the release date has to be pushed back 1 week... because having to suddenly wake up at 4:45 every morning to help a family member with a something turned out to be a lot more exhausting than I'd anticipated. That SHOULD be over with now (thank GOD!), so I can finally resume my normal work schedule.

[It's about 31 mins long and VERY beginner-friendly](https://preview.redd.it/vb5qq9fdsxj41.png?width=2555&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3a739ec382f4b60717fa6ce2233a463e5bc0da3)

The new upload date for this video is **SAT March 7**.

After that, I'll be releasing videos **every SAT at 12PM PST**.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll get to the **Character Configuration**, **HUD layout**, and eventually probably share my **Keybinds**, too and stuff all of those videos into a single ""ALL THE SETTINGS"" Youtube playlist.

This particular video has taken a massive amount of time to complete to this point, so I'll need to be careful about which videos I choose to make to keep up with my 1-per-week upload schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as soon as I'm done with this video, I'm going to start my Let's Play FFXIV series for my second Youtube channel:

[Protipz: Attractive thumbnails are important](https://preview.redd.it/q0s89u0esxj41.png?width=841&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86cdcab2c8966dc24c17d8c83a1838bd4a055af7)

I'll be uploading these videos... maybe 4-5 times per week, at **12PM PST on weekdays**.

These videos will require WAY less time to edit, so I can produce them much, much faster. Plus, it'll give me plenty of B-roll footage for my ""Guide"" videos.

&amp;#x200B;

So... that's what I've been up to!

I just wanted to share this with you guys since I'd originally said I'd be uploading a video today. (Sorry!)

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any questions, comments, or whatever else, let me know!

fbh3rp,Hakul,Eden's Verse (Savage) PF strat terms,"This is mainly for those new to PF and people in statics trying to practice / do weeklies on PF and are not used to the terms used in PF. 

**Eden's Verse: Fulmination (E5S)**

TN / True north: The position picked at the start for Fury's Fourteen will be fixed no matter where the boss is.

Boss Relative: The position picked at the start for Fury's Fourteen is based on where the boss will jump to, to keep melees always in front of the boss / healers at the back for melee uptime. 

CL triangle: The party splits into two groups (also chosen before the fight) left and right of the boss and the chain passes in a triangle between healer, melee and ranged. Tanks are kept out of the chain mechanic.

CL clock positions: The party picks clock positions at the start of the fight and the chain is passed to the person on the left. 


**Eden's Verse: Furor (E6S)**

Tethers: This is for Hands of Flame tethers from Ifrit and Raktapaksa. 90% of the parties will handle this as T/H spread north, DPS spread south, but does not apply to the last set of tethers that come with enumeration, which are handled in your intercardinal spot. 

Conflag spread: Mostly DPS west, T/H east or the other way. 

Conflag DPS in/out/in: DPS will start from the side of the boss they spread before and dodge aoes into the boss, then step back, then back in. **Make sure this is discussed in the instance, not always written in the PF desc**

Conflag DPS across: DPS will start from the side of the boss they spread before and dodge aoes while running through the boss. **Make sure this is discussed in the instance, not always written in the PF desc**

Conflag enumeration groups: Some groups keep static waymarks for north T/H, south T/H and one DPS (his tethered partner follow him to the same waymark) and the last 2 DPS adjust, some wing all 4 DPS. **Make sure this is discussed in the instance, rarely written in the PF desc**

**Eden's Verse: Iconoclasm (E7S)**

Crossed tethers: https://i.imgur.com/RQN6xcD.png

DPS are spread like in the image, first left tether goes top right, second left tether goes second right, first right tether goes top left, second right tether goes second left. T/H stay mid in 2 groups  It's the safest for DPS positioning. 

Not crossed tethers / Fox strat: https://i.imgur.com/hO1vV7O.png

DPS go on their corresponding side, but **must land on the very edge** or they will clip / kill another DPS. Easier to understand but much stricter positioning.

Ilya strat: https://i.imgur.com/VkN8wux.png 

Seriously don't do that unless you absolutely hate your DPS and hate uptime.

Adds will either be teleport ahead or teleport to the other add, if it's not listed in PF it might be discussed in the instance.

**Eden's Verse: Refulgence (E8S)**

Light rampant uptime strat: https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/f86jwe/e8s_light_rampant_uptime_strat_for_pf/

Light rampant Ilya strat: https://youtu.be/jA0SMoZXjJE?t=589 (no tl;dr because he likes to talk a lot)

Light rampant orbs across: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y_1zRP8hUH_Js32dYFhIZYx1tjnM3kucBEBqB8ys7qg/preview (under fight strategy)

This is what is used on Primal, so if the other DCs have a strat used in PF and not listed here let me know and I'll add it.",72,1583002335,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbh3rp/edens_verse_savage_pf_strat_terms/,ffxiv,1
fbh15x,FFXIVkittycat01,Not sure if I should start over with a new account. Very torn.,"I started playing FFXIV in 2014 when I lived in Canada with my ex husband. I now live in the USA and I'm staying here.

My account is locked to Canada and it can't be changed. My account is also locked to a PS4 account which is also locked to Canada. 

I don't have anything on that PS4 account that I care about. 

I have only 2 jobs at 70 I believe. I have a lot of other jobs at 50-60. I know nothing about the main story, but I wish I did. I have no friends on either account (FFXIV or PS4). I already made a new PS4 account for my new PS4 but I'm debating on making a new FFXIV account or just using my old one. I really don't care about anything on the FFXIV account except my pony mounts (I have all of them and the special horse), my wolf from the one water primal and the Titania EX fairy dragon.

fbgv9k,CeeDubzz,My best experience yet as a new player.,"This will probably be wholesome for you veterans out there. 

So I’m just reaching Heavensward MSQ and I’ve been maining WHM, LOVING IT by the way. Yesterday I decided to knock out some of my Extreme trial quests. So I queue for Shiva EX. 

We wipe a couple times but we have a mentor in the group explaining things pretty well. So probably about the third attempt Shiva is probably 1/4 HP left and the group starts wiping. It’s just me, a tank, and a couple DPS left and I start panicking trying to keep everyone alive and get off a Raise somehow. Suddenly I see the mentor say in chat “Healer LB3”.

I have used LB before but never 3. The first thought was maybe I should raise one more before I use my LB3 because I assumed it was just a party heal like it’s been before. Whatever, I bust it off anyway, and to my surprise the whole squad is back in action and I saved the wipe and got the clear. 

During the fight I keep thinking to myself “this music is pretty tight....” and I was even going to look it up afterwards. Loot rolls come around and there’s the Boreus whistle. I roll a 95 and win the mount. I hope on that bad boy and what do you know, it’s the Shiva EX phase 2 music. I was so stoked lol.

Anyway, just wanted to share my first awesome experience with the game with the rest of you guys. Seems to be a lot of new players and the game can be pretty confusing at first but don’t give up.",1,1583001406,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbgv9k/my_best_experience_yet_as_a_new_player/,ffxiv,1
fbgu5p,DaiTenshu,What QoL changes/buffs would you give to your favorite/main job to enhance your enjoyment?,"As my favorite job is Dark Knight, I can think of 3 things that aren't exactly damage buffs but I would feel would greatly enhance my experience with the job. Of course while it would be ideal if all 3 QoL changes could happen, I would be more than happy if just one of these things were made into reality.

The first change (most prioritized) would definitely have Living Dead be tweaked a bit. From a thematic perspective it sounds like a really cool clutch move; in reality it is clunky and stress-inducing. If I have an invuln that could potentially kill me, I would love it if either the health requirement was lowered (50/75%) or Walking dead lasts at least 2 secs longer than HG (ideally 5, not because I'm jealous of PLDs or anything).

The 2nd change I would enjoy is if Abyssal Drain had a charge counter similar to our gap closer. Just 2 charges would suffice. While stormblood drk was far from the best tank, it was imo the most fun tank when it came to dungeon runs. Doing massive pulls and never dying thanks to Dark arts abyssal drain spam while having a delicate balance of health, mana, and blood. I would be lying if I said I didnt miss those days, but having 2 charges of current abyssal drain will be more than satisfactory for me.

And the 3rd change (least prioritized) is giving more reward to using The Blackest Night correctly. As much as I love/adore this skill, I get annoyed when people point out that TBN is at best dps-neutral (which, admittedly, is true) and at worse, a dps-loss (also true). So maybe if TBN does pop, the next edge/flood should not be just free, but also a guaranteed critical direct hit or just guaranteed crit and also (completely optional, doesn't need to happen if 2 charge abyssal drain comes true) heal for a portion of damage dealt. To me, nothing is more satisfying than mitigating a tank buster with TBN and then slap the boss with a ""NO U"" with a big fat number.

Sorry if this came out long, but I honestly believe that if any of these QoL changes I would be way happier with these than if DRK just got some potency adjustment (which I obviously won't complain about if that happens instead). What about you guys? What QoL change do you believe would make your main/favorite job more enjoyable? I genuinely want to know and hopefully others would have similar ideas to said changes.",82,1583001278,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbgu5p/what_qol_changesbuffs_would_you_give_to_your/,ffxiv,1

fbghp5,RuneiStillwater,The Qitari history choose your own adventure frustrates me. (spoiler-ish),"So we know so little about the Ronkan lore as is... I accept that as the story teller not wanting to throw out all the details too fast as it gives them room to adjust and push out things here and there as this expansion continues. But the Qitari ""choose your own adventure"" is kinda... ""meh"" to me.

I went all in that the beginning history was not great. After all early empires tend to make the most mistakes and it's not unlikely that the Qitari suffered from ""Excuse me sir, do you have a flag? No? Oh dear me your now a colony!"" levels of empire building. But that doesn't mean that things didn't improve over time. So I went with the father's idea. And the quest affirmed my choice. I figured I'd chosen right.

Then the Viis subject came up and I figured once more that things did not go well, and the quest affirmed I'd been right, but it also tossed out that it was the Qitari that showed compassion that spared the Viis in the end. And that made me think about it a bit... that in the end the Qitari had turned the other cheek which is interesting.

Then came stage three and the new player hit the field with the ""fishmen"" which are the Namazu. I was presented with two choices... one they played nice and shared in a time of hardship, or they went murder hobo. A deep part of me thought it was very possible the Qitari, out of desperation, massacred the Namazu much like what nearly happened with the Xaela in the steppe's through the cut-scene's the player gets to see. But it nagged at me that the Qitari showed compassion to the Viis when their kind were being slaughtered and eaten by amazon bunnies and I figured that would have stuck with them if I was right about the second stella. So for the first time I choose the boy's view. Which jeebus my OCD hit when the new stone was blue rather then red.

But out of curiosity I looked up a few things and it seems that even the quest log dump doesn't really elude to it one way or another. In one source it seems it always affirms whatever you chose. And as someone that respects history and what it can tell I'm actually really frustrated with how this quest line works. Yeah it's a game, but should they really just be ""restoring"" these works on the whim of the warrior of darkness's call? Yeah they are short lived, but this is their history.... more care should be put into it! Not ""Well we can't decide so this random stranger that saved our bacon shall cast the deciding vote!"" I just wish there was more of a ""research"" phase to determine this bit of game lore. Make it feel more like an impact and choices matter and not like the most recent seasonal event where you just choose whatever to dispense your rewards. sigh. I don't know I'm just a lore nerd that likes to learn about the game.

fbe2wq,WickedSnake,I Just Want to Commend Natsuko Ishikawa and Her Work,"\~ kind of \~ new player here   


i skipped the MSQ, and played through Heavensward  


I thought both were mindnumbingly boring   


I skipped Stormblood because I watched the cutscenes, and did not find the story to be all that entertaining   


I have REALLY fuckin enjoying Shadowbringers   


The story is so much more personable, it slows down at points, yes, but it has yet to be stretched thin, which is my #1 complaint with the MSQ, and HW stories.   


My second complaint would be that the MSQ, and HW stories were extrospective, while Shadowbringers, as where I'm at right now, in the game, is much more introspective.   


There is much more of a focus on the characters, which I prefer.   


Admittedly, I am not a fan of the ""save-the-world"" plotlines, generally, especially when they're not character driven.   


With that being said, I hope Square, and Natsuko Ishikawa continue to put out good content, like this, Natsuko Ishikawa deserves, and has earned not only her place on the FF14 team, but a CUSTOMER, a FAN, and praise.   


What I would like to see in the future is full voice acting, as it is quite troublesome for me to read through all of the text, due to a problem with my eyes xD  


I would also like to say, what I also enjoy about Shadowbringers (so far) is that its content is focused, and is steady. The story is always at the forefront, and progressing. There's no padding. The padding is what turned me off of the MSQ, and HW.   


I am not sure how Square feels about spending the money on producing expansions like this, but I hope they continue to do so, because it is very fucking cool imo to have a full-fledged story, that isn't a mindless level grind, like WoW, or the MSQ, AND endgame on top of it.",9,1582990251,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbe2wq/i_just_want_to_commend_natsuko_ishikawa_and_her/,ffxiv,1

fbajzi,Chris_7941,Should Superbolide keep HP of recent healings?,"I think we've all seen plenty of memes about GNBs using superbolide just as they received a cooldown heal which immediately nullifies the advantage. While it's all fun and games in the post game I feel like in the action this gives a lot of people a lot of unnecessary stress so I wondered if there was a solution to that while keeping the skills' intended risky nature.

The best I was able to come up with was the idea of Superbolide's HP burn ""ignoring"" recently incoming heals. For that I would use a 1 second window, to compensate for lag or a player's slow reaction. This means that, for example, when a white mage casts Tetragrammaton to restore 50,000 points of health, and the GNB activates Superbolide less than a second afterwards, they will be left with 50,001 HP.

I think the window is strict enough to prevent players from abusing this in some way, and it would primarily fix the frustration that stems from poor communication, particularly in PUG raids where the lack of voice comm makes writing ""I am going to activate Superbolide"" a time-consuming and therefore irrecommendable tactic.

I am aware that Square Enix and the FF14 developers do not read the subreddit. However I am posting this here as well as in the official forums, since I am curious about your opinion on the suggestions and there is (or at least seems to be) much less active discourse in the official forums.",13,1582970964,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fbajzi/should_superbolide_keep_hp_of_recent_healings/,ffxiv,1

fb9x6q,Tibies,Anyone encountered issues after transferring licenses ? (ps4),"Hi, 

So here's my issue, i asked Square, to transfer the licenses of FFXIV, including both expansions, from old SEID &amp; PSN account, to my new SEID &amp; PSN account, long story short, they did, however, now when i try to log in, the game asks me to register, or log into my FFXIV account (the same screen you receive when you start FFXIV for the first time) i receive the following error ''this ffxiv license is already linked to this psn account, please log in with a different account'' 

Which leaves me unable to play the game :/. Sadly, support is very abrupt on mail, and takes them at least two days to get back to me, and even then, when i asked about my collectors edition items, and if they would stay intact, i never received an answer :(. 

Did anyone else happen to have the same, or something like issue, and how did you fix it ?. I've already emailed support again, but will have to wait until after the weekend most likely.

fb9vt7,SmeagolOfThePrecious,"I don't know why anyone hasn't said this before, but my sources point to them being an Ascian. (LATE SHADOWBRINGERS MSQ((NOT POST)) **SPOILERS**","Yes, I'm talking about Ran'jit. Now, hold the phone before you bash me into Oblivion. I have several pieces of evidence as to why I believe this.

1. Ran'jit is literally hundreds of years old. There are multiple times in the msq where it is stated this man is older than the normal amount of years of his kind. Seriously, what the helll?

2. Ran'jit states before the final battle that he is not controlled by Vauthry, and acts of his own free will. This means that Ran'jit isn't eating meol like all of the other idiots in Eulmore. And of he is (which I highly doubt), it isn't working in Vauthry's favor.

3. Ran'jit is incredibly powerful. This man can summon some powerful things in battle. Not only does he dabble in the arts of creation magicks, he also changes to a very dark and altered form with a scythe in his final battle in Eulmore. The effects we see coming off of him aren't unlike that of an ascian. The only difference is that he wears no mask, and has yet to admit he is an ascian, if he is one.

4. Emet-Selch prefers to work alone. Note this. We never see Emet-Selch and Ran-flipping-jit at the same time. It's like they are avoiding each other, which possibly could be due to the fact that they wish to not interject in each others plans. It would be counterintuitive to hurt your buddies plans if you're working on the same goal. You know, to resurrect Lord Zodiark.

5. THE THUNDERER ((An Ascian boss theme that has ONLY been used for Ascians in MSQ; NOT including side content use)) plays for Ran'jit's final battle in the vanilla MSQ. Now, this is either simply a play on the fact Ran'jit likes to use electrical attacks, or he's an ascian.

WAKE UP PEOPLE. OPEN YOUR THIRD EYE. Ran'jit is defeated, but he isn't dead if he's an Ascian! He will return if he is. Sure, he isn't a paragon, but he might just be one of the titled offices of Ascians, if not a very powerful lesser Ascian.",31,1582966346,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fb9vt7/i_dont_know_why_anyone_hasnt_said_this_before_but/,ffxiv,1

fb9uhr,cinderlux,"Discord idea, maybe? Assuming it hasn't already been done. D:"," 

One thing I've noticed in the XIV Discord community is that all the servers have many many members and upon first invite it can get very overwhelming, especially with all the different roles and channels etc. I've noticed it's also nearly impossible to meet new people on these channels because people are already so close-knit. (No shade! Just an observation, I have met my fair share of fun people through discord. :3)

Anyway, I had an idea for a server that would work on a much simpler side - basically, several moderators would be enlisted in roles such as mentors (Crafter mentor, Dancer mentor, Raid mentor, etc etc) and any new member that joins would go directly to maybe a sprout role and from the online list they could directly message someone any question they perhaps have in mind?

It would of course be quite time consuming potentially replying to so may messages, and it would require the mods to be open to direct DM's from lots of people. Or even so if there's a better way for it to work perhaps we could smash our ideas together?

fb91c0,syphons,Amaurot: was it really perfect?,"Would you call ""perfect"" a society that made bloodthirsty animals just for funsies?

If Akademia and Anamnesis have shown us anything is that their creation philosophy was basically ""we do what we must because we can."" It could be argued that the most important way of interacting with the world of FFXIV we have with the game is through beating stuff up and that's what we're offered, but quests can involve so much more than that! 

And even when they do, say, by testing out a toy, we have it result in destructive forces that shouldn't exist.

fb7klz,GabrielCeleste,Souls and Rebirth,"How exactly does the process of aetherial reincarnation work in this world?  I ask this because I've been kind of stumped on a possible flaw in the lore's logic in this regard that someone might be able to shed better light on.

We do know certain things about souls thanks to some significant revelations in Shadowbringers.  The Ancient Hythlodaeus said that he ""recognized the color of our soul.""  This would naturally imply that someone he knew in his time had a similar ""color"" to their soul, and that we are likely a future incarnation - either in part or in whole - of that person to the point that the soul seems at least recognizable if not identical.

However, this draws into question the greater implication of whether the aetherial cycle keeps a soul intact or not.  In a cycle where Hythlodaeus can discern our soul's color as distinct from others, it would imply that it hasn't been tainted through myriad cycles of rebirth, death, reconstitution into the aetherial sea, and rebirth yet again.  One of several things must be happening here:

1. The Aetherial Sea manages to keep all aether unmixed in order to reincarnate it at a future time in a very similar or identical form to that of its predecessor.
2. The Blessing of Light has a side effect of maintaining purity of aether for those with the Echo.  Of course, this possibility is somewhat marred by the recent revelation that all people have the innate capability of opening to the Echo if given proper stimulus.
3. Only souls originating from the Ancients are capable of maintaining purity, but children produced thereafter are all crafted from recycling aether.
4. We just got lucky and had a recognizable soul after all this time.
5. Some other explanation I haven't considered yet.

However, as reason #3 starts to delve into, you have to start asking yourself what happens when the population increases?  Is there a well of untapped soul aether with enough dormant souls to cover all future population growth?  Are souls being ""added"" each time a new child is born that wasn't present in the past?  Are people virtually identical copies of their past selves, or does each new life represent a completely new combination of random aether that happened to be the Aetherial Sea?

It's kind of a catch-22.  On the one hand, our soul is recognizable to someone thousands of years ago.  But on the other hand, from what we know of the workings of the Aetherial Cycle, we should sort of be a conglomeration of aether from things that perished before us, which would render us no different from any other soul... just a muddy mix of thousands of colors.

Is this a flaw in the lore?  A loophole?  Or am I just mistaken?",17,1582952010,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fb7klz/souls_and_rebirth/,ffxiv,1

fb7crr,Kolby_Jack,The Ascians and grief. [5.2 Spoilers],"I was listening to SotR earlier today and an off-hand comment by Mr. Happy about how Elidibus seemed ""dead inside"" got me thinking about the three unsundered Ascians and how perhaps they represent the different ways people grieve. 

First we have Lahabrea, who strikes out against the sundered with glee and satisfaction in causing us as much harm as he can. He's not dumb about it like Nabriales, but he clearly feels nothing but spiteful rage for the sundered people. Maybe he represents the grieving person who lashes out at those around them, whether they deserve it or not.

Then we have Emet-Selch, who represents the bereft, someone wallowing in sadness and self-pity. That's obvious enough, especially as he tries to hide it behind a veneer of sarcasm. And to cap it off, he fades away with a sorrowful plea that he and his loved ones be remembered.

Elidibus is much harder to get a read on. At times he seems to hate us, at times he seems to not mind us. In this latest patch, he seems like he just doesn't care about us beyond the thorn we are in his side. We aren't worth fighting, and we aren't worthy of remembering the lost. Maybe he represents the grieving person that just completely shuts down, emotionally. Going through the motions, surviving, but the world has turned completely gray for them. 

I dunno, I'm just wondering where Elidibus character will go from here, what his resolution will be. Food for thought.",62,1582950850,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fb7crr/the_ascians_and_grief_52_spoilers/,ffxiv,1

fb39h6,fairtradesloth,Best Game Ever!!,"My first post on this sub and I just wanted to say that I am head over heels in love with this game. I grew up playing Final Fantasy. FF6 was my first RPG ever and still one of my favorites. I remember the first time I played FF7 and the graphics just totally blew my mind. I've loved every FF I've played, and it's easily my favorite franchise.

I stopped gaming when I got out of college for almost a decade. The last FF I had played was 12. Witcher 3 pulled me back into gaming recently when I built a PC. I've never played an MMO before, and though I had heard of FF14 I didn't pay any attention to it at all (literally knew nothing about it except it's an MMO) because I had no interest in online gaming like that. Then I saw the Shadowbringers trailer pop up on youtube. I was fascinated, so I started reading about FF14 and was downloading it by the end of the day.

This morning I completed Patch 2.0, heading into the fetch quests that tie ARR to Heavensward next. I know that it gets a LOT better - I've read enough to realize that, and I gotta say it makes me so excited because I LOVED ARR! Sure, it's slow to start but honestly? That was totally awesome. I actually care about my character...they've designed it so well. I never thought I'd care about a player-made character but I do. The world is so gorgeous and gigantic and there's so much to do. I'm still overwhelmed. I've done very little outside of MSQ and I am standing here reveling in all that there is to come. I'll be playing this for years.

I'm not sure if I'll keep trucking through the MSQ right now or take a break and maybe level a 2nd job. I'm a summoner right now and really dig it. I'm tempted to try scholar or something at least but I'm also tempted to just wait until my summoner gets to level 80.

Anyway the best part is aside from knowing the MSQ gets a lot better, I know NOTHING. Not a single thing has been spoiled for me. Every day I'm greeted with twists and turns that I didn't know were coming. It is so exciting and I'm so happy to be part of this world with you all. Oh, and speaking of which, you're all so freaking nice! I goofed up in the final dungeon of 2.0 this morning and was expecting people to yell at me, but did they? No! They helped me and encouraged me and I got a bunch of player commendations even though I feel like I sucked. What an outstanding community this is.

You've heard it all before but I just had to say how much I love this game, and wish I had discovered it years ago honestly. But it's all good, because apparently SE isn't slowing down and there are probably many years left of FFXIV being an active world to be a part of.",8,1582931037,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fb39h6/best_game_ever/,ffxiv,1

That seems to have all completely changed in SB and I no longer have any idea what the purpose of summoner pvp is.  Can someone help me out or point me in the right direction for up to date summoner pvp guides? Or maybe just help me understand what I’m looking to do,1,1582926358,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fb28bv/pvp_questions_for_summoners/,ffxiv,1

BUT.  That one dungeon just screws me over in every way.  The trash pulls, the first boss running to the corner, and those god damn cannons on the 2nd boss.  I have never been so trash at a mechanic in my life, to the point it is flat embarassing.  At one point, I got mobbed on my cannon and couldn't do anything and died.  We wiped twice, but finally got through the awful cannon minigame but then our tank died to the trash pulls right after, and I just felt like crap and quit.  

I go from getting commends and accolades to 'wtf is this idiot whm doing'.  I tried spamming the dungeon last night just because I struggle so hard, and I failed it twice.

fayd50,MorrisonOdd,{SPOILERS} : Ruby Doomsday 5.2 Quest...Ending?,"Just finished the Trial for Ruby weapon. (A little late but whatever.) And I'm not sure if anyone's discussed this or not...

At some point right at the end of the quest after finding out about The Orphans affiliation with the creation of the Omega Weapon and Milisandia's death to Ruby Weapon. Valdeaulin, the Elezen follower with Severa, tells Gaius that he's sure the encounter with his children has sparked some memories of his time in Garlemald, and that he **will** kill him if he thinks of ever returning to his masters. ((I'm like, they already went to Garlemald...even as far as Gaius charging into the throne room and watching Varis 'die' and feel sorry for it.))

1st question: Has Gaius suffered some sort of Amnesia, it seems obvious but is it ever mentioned? I mean, what he went through in ARR, he seems to remember all of that what with the WoL and the Ascians...but maybe not before that?

2nd question: Who is Valdeaulin? Other than some follower, I thought that these people Gaius met up with and travels along followed him out of respect or for him wanting to hunt Ascians. At least maybe Severa, but Valdeaulin's behaviour is sketchy. Just that one line...now he seems untrustworthy and scary. Who the hell are these people? 

I'm so confused. I admit, I might have missed things here and there, and if so can someone please explain. Thx.",25,1582911351,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fayd50/spoilers_ruby_doomsday_52_questending/,ffxiv,1

Designing a house for others (FC mates) in my opinion is easy.

However personally? I always struggle what I would want in my personal estate, sometimes I visit other houses for inspiration too.

fasa3k,Dynahazzar,[ShB spoilers] About Astral and Umbral elements,"Hi

I've been researching lore about the elements recently and it made me wonder about the astral/umbral alignment.

As I understand it, each element can come in either Astral (chaos, movement, energy, change) or Umbral (order, stillness, exhaustion, stasis) form. The common (and only as far as I can tell) example that's given is how Astral Fire would be a roaring inferno while Umbral Fire would be a debilitating desert heat. That's nice, but what about the other elements? I tried to think of different aspects of everything and I didn't go very far (I'm not a very creative person).

In your understanting, what could be the different manifestation of each polarity?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

||Astral|Umbral|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Fire|Roaring blaze, devouring brasier|Desert Heat, Oven|
|Earth|||
|Ice|||
|Water|Raging Sea, Tsunami||
|Wind|Tornado, Cyclone||
|Thunder|Thunderstorm|Electromagnetism? Maybe Ceruleum?|
|Light||The 1st|
|Darkness|The 13rd||

&amp;#x200B;

So, as you can see I'm not exactly inspired and I'm pretty sure some things are pretty wrong, but that's ecatly why I'm proposing this to you all.",20,1582882540,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fasa3k/shb_spoilers_about_astral_and_umbral_elements/,ffxiv,1

Before that i had played WoW as my main game where no one realy cares about it.

Now coming back into it and seeing more and more of the community have a instant gag reflex about it is pretty annoying.

Why shouldnt i be able to kick people from my group if they are bad? Why shouldnt i chose who i play with based on their performance? I see no reason to hate on it, im not telling people not to play im just telling them not to play with me.


Seeing like the ""competitive"" raiding scene is way more big in WoW and they allow addons that literally tell you about every mechanic and what to do.

fap6fe,Meralien90,Anamnesis Anyder's Purpose [Speculation] - SPOILERS,"So, I'm curious about everyone's thoughts on Anamnesis. In the [Dengeki interview](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/f3n6xq/dengeki_online_interview_with_naoki_yoshida_no/) before 5.2 dropped, Yoshi talked about how our perception of the dungeon would change after we completed the story. However, I can't say it changed too much for me by the end of 5.2. It was pretty clear while going through it the first time that it was a facility that the Ancients used to store concepts. The only thing that shifted was our understanding of who was running the place, which appears to have been the Venat/Hydaelyn faction.

I'm wondering though, did Yoshi mean that our perception would change after 5.3? He said we should examine our surroundings closely, so I've been looking around during runs to try and see beyond the ""obvious.""

There are a few things that have stood out to me so far:

1) The place gives me big ""ark"" vibes. It reminds me of those archives you hear about in science fiction (and even real life) where the DNA of the planet's flora and fauna is collected, stored, and protected in the event of a calamity. The room filled with concept crystals *is* called ""The Archive Eternal."" Just makes me wonder whether the purpose of Anamnesis went beyond simple concept storage.

2) The archive area and final room are remarkably well-preserved, especially considering how much the building exterior and outer rooms are being consumed by sea life. There are also plants on the tables that are very much alive and not withered. It's almost as if the place is still being tended...

3) The concept crystals in the final room are *immense*. There are 13 floating in the air (interestingly enough), and the others are sitting in pools of what appears to be condensed aether. What do these crystals contain, and why are there so many? Were they created for a special project? Perhaps something related to the ""guardian forces"" talked about at the Akadaemia? It looked like the benthos matriarch may have been planning to use these crystals in her tribe's efforts to ""take revenge upon the finless."" Which is a little terrifying. We know all the concept crystals within Anamnesis are still active. That final room is essentially filled with potential weapons.

4) Finally, what the heck is up with the Unknown boss? It's definitely not a mere sea creature. Is it a remnant nightmare from the Final Days? Though you would think that all of them would have been dealt with and gone by the time the Sundering happened. Maybe it's just a perverted creation? Or perhaps, it's something even worse and is some kind of alien spawn related to the Sound.

faomlc,-Zextras-,"2 Quests into Stormblood and I'm already confused, looking for some help!","Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start by stating that I have some trouble following stories at times and am trying my best to follow FF14's but get pretty confused and lost at times with it. I'm also going to mark this post as a ""spoiler"" just in case anything does slip out. I would like to request that any comments be as spoiler free as you can make them while still getting your point across, thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

While I was able to follow Heavensward with little to no problems I just got to and started Stormblood's expansion today and instantly got confused with what is going on.. I have done the pre-expansion quests and the first couple of the actual expansion. From what I followed, there is a wall that separates two lands. We are on one side and the ""enemy"" is on the other as well as some friendly rebels. Something happened to make a group of the rebels attack the wall and summon a great primal. We used a weapon to attack the primal and (This is the part that really confuses me) now we are at war with some empire for some reason (???).

&amp;#x200B;

Where did the talk of war come from?! I thought we were just fighting a primal or trying to defend the world against it and in the matter of what felt like a single quest we were on the other side of the wall, gathering troops and readying for war with some empire! What even sparked the flame to start this to happen?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I am missing something huge and I really don't want to continue the story any more until I figure it out and piece together what I missed so I don't go into this expansion so lost and confused. While I know I'm not far at *all* in the new story and that more will probably be explained as I go further, I feel like I missed the beginning and that's not a good start to a story!

&amp;#x200B;

Any help on figuring out what's going on or some recap of what I missed would be greatly appreciated!",10,1582861774,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/faomlc/2_quests_into_stormblood_and_im_already_confused/,ffxiv,1

fan0ki,NamooL,A quick guide for void gate survival (E7S),"0: stand in the middle of the arena to start with, look at your debuff and look at the birds. Go to the birds with opposite color - if you are light buff find dark birds if you are dark buff find light birds. Do this in the middle two columns. 

1: when you get hit by the bird, if you are on the middle left column (2nd column from left) you need to go to 2nd or 4th row on either left or right most column of the arena. If you are on the middle right, you need to go to the 1st or 3rd row. 

2: go to the lane you determined in step 1. As waiting for the 1st bird rush to resolve, Pay attention to the first portal on the left side (NW corner). If it’s blue, you stay on the same lane that you are currently at for the next bird rush. If it’s red, you need to move a lane up or down for the next bird rush. Wait for the rush to resolve. 

3: bait the aoe outside of column 1 and 4. Get some heals if you need, go to the lane that you determined in step 2. You will see a aoe marker on your head. Ignore them for now. Instead pay attention to the NW corner again. This time it’s opposite to all the previous logic. If it’s red, you stay in your lane for the next up. If it’s blue, you move 1 lane up or down. 

4: wait for the 2nd bird rush to resolve, wait for the aoe to resolve (don’t clip anyone. You can drop them towards the middle lane and come back. You have some time), then go to the lane that you determined in step 3. 

Mechanic finished. 

The same tell can be used during phase 1. 
If the 2nd column bird rushes first at the start of the mechanics, you need to start in blue (2nd and 4th row on the side). If the 3rd lane bird rushes first, you need to start in red (1st and 3rd row on the side first) then from there:

If NW is blue. You stay after you dodge the 2 birds. If NW is red, you move up or down one lane after you dodge the 2 birds. 

Red: move, move
Blue: move, stay

This is based on the back portal are always left red and right blue when it first appeared - for all the wipes and clear I never see otherwise unless I’m super lucky. Right side portals are always fixed in place red blue red blue. And birds always rush from right to left. Knowing this, light and dark and color and such is only relevant at the start of the mechanics.",5,1582854478,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fan0ki/a_quick_guide_for_void_gate_survival_e7s/,ffxiv,1

fakdlj,Izzy_SX,FF XIV New Tank Hate [RANT],"This post has probably been made 100 times. But for the life of me, I don't understand why FF XIV has such toxic DPS/ (some healer players). I have played this game for about 8 months, with a maxed out lvl 80 dragoon &amp; machinist, never had any issues. Recently trying out Warrior, obviously a tank role. I admit I am not a tank expert but I know what I am doing, rotating cooldowns, tank stance on, drawing aggro. And every so often I run into am entitled annoying DPS that thinks he/she can play the role better. 

I am honestly annoyed with the playerbase in this game, and I am sure I am not the only one. Sure you could say, just leave you're only one person. But you better bet it's gonna pile up. That's why most of the people I know play dps and not tank. Because there is apparently no burden for dps and they can sit back all game and criticize the smallest things everyone else is doing wrong. If you play DPS understand that you have the easiest role, dodge aoes and pour in damage, that is it! You only speed up the process, I know that sounds bad but honestly as a DPS main I can admit this. Apparently some can't and feel they play such a pivotal role, you don't. And you can be replaced quickly as a majority of players use DPS classes.

I know others can say otherwise, but all my time playing DPS in this game, I have never seen a toxic tank. Only now that the roles are reverse I start to see this ridiculous shift. 

I realize not every role is for everybody, and playing tank may not be for me. But man playing tank in this game and seeing this pretentious entitlement is worse than WoW and Overwatch (in my experience) and that says a lot!

Now I see why people don't play tank lol, way easier to sit back and watch everything unfold.",43,1582843117,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fakdlj/ff_xiv_new_tank_hate_rant/,ffxiv,1

I have been an MMO fan since I can remember and have been playing WoW on and off for years.

They also cannot seem to understand people like to play on alts. Anyway, THANK YOU for creating such a beautiful game that connects everything to one on character!!!

I honestly was very hesitant in playing this game because the anime look and feel has never attracted me game wise. BUT that is not the case with this game! They do such a wonderful job blending the anime style into such a beautiful and colorful world that it looks and feels real.  

I showed my wife WoW and she was not impressed. She defines clicking a button to do something as boring. The first saving grace for this game was when I found out that she can use a controller.

fah69d,Enlog,"Idea: A variant of Stone, Sky, Sea for mechanics","I was thinking about the second boss from Bardam's Mettle; the golem that can't be attacked and only tests you on your ability to avoid damage from mechanics. And I think that that format could make for a good way to let players practice common mechanics outside of instanced fights. 

We currently have Stone, Sky, Sea as a way for players to test their rotations and make sure they've got enough damage output to theoretically beat a given encounter. But this doesn't help you get better with avoiding mechanics; this is something that you mostly have to do in the fight itself. But if we had a version of these practice arenas in which a golem used stuff like gaze attacks, puddle-dropping attacks, knockbacks, and so on, it could be a good way for players to practice dealing with common threats. Failing a mechanic wouldn't kill you; it would mark you with a ""debuff"" that makes the practice fail if you get too many.

I don't know if I'd want there to be ones for each new encounter; there's something to be said for experiencing new things from a new fight. But I think this kind of practice area could help out.

I don’t know whether it’s too late on buying the game since it’s been out for so long or if I should wait on the next ff mmorpg game. I do see all the expansion packs that have recently been out and I’m tempted to playing it but I’m not sure if I’m better off waiting for their next game.

I’ve played SAO games and some I’ve liked and some I didn’t but I’ve heard that ff14 is much more bigger on the rpg features and mechanics than sao.

fafpms,WorstGenRey,To Heal or To DPS? Getting frustrated.,"Hello all,

I recently, last week,  bought the level up to 70 white mage from MogStation. In order to get accustomed to the skills, I went straight to Sastasha, and moved up on wards depending how comfortable I felt with my new skills. At Aurum Vale, Tank got frustrated with me because I was not healing him. ""I need you to keep healing and stop dpsing because you are not a dps."" I replied back with "" Everyone is at full health, what exactly am I going to heal?"" He then decided to take off his tank stance and I ended up dying for that very reason. He then was voted off the island.

In another instance, The vault, I was constantly healing because of people standing on AOE's and was kicked off because they couldnt kill the boss, but blamed me for not dpsing. At this point, I am not too sure what to do as a healer. Please, any tips would be wonderful.",17,1582825170,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/fafpms/to_heal_or_to_dps_getting_frustrated/,ffxiv,1
