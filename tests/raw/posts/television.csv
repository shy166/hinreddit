fsno33,FKingPretty,Isolation is the prime time to do a rewatch of 24!,"Watching the pilot episode brings back so many memories and I’m looking forward to watching the series progress. 
The pilot has dated. News feeds projected on walls (technology in tv/ films will always date whatever you’re watching), and Carlos Bernards soul patch. But in terms of twists and turns this was the forerunner for me of exciting TV. Later seasons got increasingly ridiculous and repetitive, I’m looking at you season 4 and 6, but Jack Bauer helped to reshape genre TV.

fsnnkz,xViiPeRxl,Noone seems to talk about Taboo,"Tom hardy is incredible in this, i just finished it today binged the whole thing (not a bingeable show really) its a slow burn, if you like tom hardy and/or like period dramas then this shows right up your alley. Its from the same creator as peaky blinders. Its great.

I have searched for any talk about it but it doesn't seem to have a presence except a couple of posts. People definitely need to jump on this, its shot really well some of the cinematography is gorgeous. Hardy is incredible aswell as a few familiar faces. I have to say this show does hold back in giving the audience answers which hopefully will be answered in S2 but its writing is most definitely good enough to warrant a watch! Please watch this especially since we have more time! 

Summary - 
Adventurer James Keziah Delaney returns to London during the War of 1812 to rebuild his late father's shipping empire. However, both the government and his biggest competitor want his inheritance at any cost - even murder.

I cannot wait for season 2 and this is definitely one of the best shows in 2017!",24,1585696337,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fsnnkz/noone_seems_to_talk_about_taboo/,television,2

 But my favorite bit is when G'Kar JUMPS to his defense in the routing of the scoundrels.  Then their subsequent drunken revelry.  

Yeah, it turns out to all be the delusions of a guilty commander...but it's still fun and powerful and sweet at the end.

This is just the sort of thing that modern Star Trek is missing.  Have a little silly fun with it.   Throw in a Lincoln or Twain or some weird creature for them to interact with.

fsn43j,Donna201299,What is your favorite Animated Fight or Action scene?,"This is mainly for fans of animation. One of the best parts about animation is that it allows the creators to create sequences that are generally impossible or difficult to do in live action. The end results, if giving a proper budget, is something truly epic. Wht are your favorite animated fight r action scene n recent years and why? It doesn't necessarily have to be a fight scene, but any animated sequence that has any form of action. Anime can also be included.

Two actions that I have always loved is Mace Windu vs The Droids in Star War: The Clone War (2003) and The symbiote vs The Sinister Six in The Spectacular Spider-Man. 

The former because of the way shows just how powerful the jedi can be. If your a fan of Samurai Jack, you know the creator know who to create and action and I feel this is one of his best.

The Latter is in my opinion one of the best animate fight scene ever as it shows a character using tactics to take down foes without sacrificing it fast paced action. I highly recommend checking out this episode in the series.",16,1585694482,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fsn43j/what_is_your_favorite_animated_fight_or_action/,television,1

Really great show overall for anyone who hasn't tried it out. If you like the Cohen bro's movie, you'll like this too, and Noah Hawley is probably my favorite creator/writer/showrunner in the game right now for this and Legion. Fargo is taking on more of his unique personal style as it goes, and I think he has transcended the strictures of the original film to make something special.

fsd6o8,Saint_eX,2018 BBC 's mini-serie Les Miserables do justice to the Victor Hugo's masterpiece,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5900600/  

It may be a little late to comment a 2018 show, but in those lock down times, this mini-serie really worth it. It's a great show.

I was more than skeptical about what you, filthy ""anglo-saxons"" had made of our French chef-d’œuvre 'Les Miserables' since the horrible Musical that have shamefully been done with it. And don't tell me about the terrible movie made out of the musical... It's sickening.   

Of course : this silly quota that changed Javert into an Afro-american is a serious insult to the novel as well as an historical revisionnist insult (not only to the ""white people"", but to the black ones, too!)  

But all in all : the mini-serie is really good and has the good length to respectfully develop the original story. If you just can forget about David Oyelowo, who's a good actor and playing it well, but who just can't fit to the role unfortunately because he's black. 

Dominic West is decent. Lilly Collins is fine. David Oyelowo is good in spite of the color of his skin (I'd definitely pick him for others historical figures, why not Napoleon's General Thomas Alexandre Dumas? But... come on, Javert? WTF?)

FWIW: you can watch it, go ahead, for once, it's validated by a French.",1,1585662401,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fsd6o8/2018_bbc_s_miniserie_les_miserables_do_justice_to/,television,1

I'm half way through Season 2 and still noticing it across almost all characters and dialogue. No one ever seems to yell obnoxiously (except those being killed by demons) and the conversations are typically just really smooth and calming. 

I noticed it especially in the last episode of Season 1 with the conversation with the priest in the church, that guy had the most relaxing voice I've heard in a while and I was just transfixed while listening to him (even if he was a gigantic piece of shit).

fs5nwi,___Guitarmadillo___,"Why does everyone in ""Man in the High Castle"" whisper? (and other complaints)","I'm pretty far behind. Season 3 premier specifically. I honestly don't know if I'm going to keep up with it. I like the over arching story, but this show struggles to hold my attention. The color palette is possibly the blandest in all of TV, the story is overly complicated. But probably my least favorite thing about the show is the the wisper acting.specifically by the shows protagonists.

Let me give you some examples of where the main protagonist was whispering their dialogue to another character: 

In a loud bar

On a dance floor

On a shooting range

And thats just in one episode! Literally 90% of all words spoken on this show are in a whisper. The whole episode just made my eyes glaze over. 

Honestly, all of the ""young"" lead protagonists of this show I have a hard time connecting with. I'm 30, so it's not like it's because I'm super old. But they all just seem really bland. And really whisper-y.

I'm really curious about how the whole thing turns out, but the plotline of John Smith in s3e1 was probably the only interesting  story arc out of the first episode.

Also I get that this show isn't supposed to be bright and cheery and colorful, but it's probably the ugliest looking TV show I've ever seen. Surely theres a middle ground thats somewhat more visually interesting.",28,1585625841,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fs5nwi/why_does_everyone_in_man_in_the_high_castle/,television,1

It was a comedy show about a recently widowed Sports Radio Personality (Perry). He is appointed by his job to joins a grief counseling group for therapy.

This group consists of different characters played by some familiar actors/actresses who later on go and do other things.

The show was funny to me because I've always love Matthew Perry's comedy and he brought out the best in the other castmates as the highlight of the crew. It first started out with 8 episodes then renewed for a full 22 episode season. But it got cut too early so it never had a satisfying climax. It seemed like it was just hitting it stride.

It was on NBC and contending with a bunch of other shows. But it was still hilarious.",71,1585620617,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fs4dal/with_all_the_television_shows_that_have_had_2_or/,television,1

fryxle,RusevReigns,The dramatic difference between Netflix in 2015 vs now,"I was going through the year by year list for debut shows, and I was struck how many shows Netflix debuted in 2015 that had buzz. It was the year the floodgates really opened as after House of Cards and Orange is the New Black in 2013, 2014 was very quiet with just Marco Polo. In 2015 they had:

Daredevil
Jessica Jones
Narcos
Sense8
Bloodline
Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
Grace and Frankie
Master of None
F is for Family
Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp

Just as striking a difference is I didn't leave out very many shows. Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Narcos, Sense8 and Bloodline are literally the only 5 dramas they released that year and they all were somewhat discussed. The only shows (not counting the ones listed under kids and animation on wiki) I didn't mention are two comedies in Richie Rich and Project Mc2.

In comparison here are the dramas Netflix has released in 2019:

2019:
The Umbrella Academy
The Order
Shadow
Black Summer
Chambers
The Society
What/If
When They See Us
Trinkets
Another Life
Wu Assassins
The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance
The I-Land
Unbelievable
Criminal: UK
Raising Dion
Dolly Parton's Heartstrings
V Wars
Virgin River
The Soundtrack
The Witcher

Comedies:
Sex Education
Russian Doll

If you took the 9-10 most relevant shows off the second list, you might get a decent comparison to the first, however I would suspect that even something acclaimed like Russian Doll is not as big a hit as Narcos or Daredevil. Do you think Netflix was better at making original shows in 2015 than 2019? Or do you think there's underrated shows on the second list and there was just more buzz around every Netflix show in general in 2015?",20,1585601279,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fryxle/the_dramatic_difference_between_netflix_in_2015/,television,1

fryk83,weedislif,I watched the first and second season of paradise PD and I regret it so much.,"I’m really unsure how it managed to get a second season as it’s just so bad, they use the same incredibly bad jokes over and over and it’s not even offensive it’s just dumb.

A incredibly hot white chick has a fat person fetish and sexually harasses a fat man and can get away with it, cool I guess. That’s the running joke between these 2 characters and it’s just not funny the first or last time.

If you do like this show could you explain why as I really don’t understand why anyone would like this show.",7,1585600056,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fryk83/i_watched_the_first_and_second_season_of_paradise/,television,1

fry4g3,CuriousPossibility7,Recently watched Hannibal and my mind is blown is this the best series ever,"I binge-watched, then rewatched. It's strange anyone hardly talks about it, no one I know has seen it.. why is the series so underrated ?? ?

It didn't feel like watching a series, it can't be rationalised and I am like fuck what just happened ?

**Amazing aspects -**

Magical realism

Horror with beauty like never before

Complete mind-bender

Mads (never noticed the guy before, seen him as random movie villains, he is outstanding here and probable unpopular opinion - he made me care about the character more than Hopkins.

The dialogues

Entire season 2, Season 2 and season 3 finale

psychological and dark romance aspects which aren't readily noticeable but once you notice... damn

I loved that the story isn't served on a plate but I have to dig inside it, look around, unearth the meanings for myself. 

The relationship - I have rarely seen such carefully built romance, most of tv romance is either for the sake of it, while there's a specific language and story and metaphors built around the gothic romantic story here.

**Not so amazing aspects**

Too many murder cases of season 1 and 2, some of them had nothing to do with the story.

Season 3 some parts looked bumpy and broken, though i liked season 3 overall.

The actor playing Will sometimes gets too theatrical, specially in season 1 and a few scenes in S3.. though overall i liked.",1,1585598693,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fry4g3/recently_watched_hannibal_and_my_mind_is_blown_is/,television,1

frt3gh,GoldenJoel,Black Summer is incredibly underrated. One of the best zombie fiction releases in years.,"Like a lot of people, I'm currently stuck in doors watching whatever I can find on Netflix.  Being the morbid sort, I've been seeking out content about outbreaks, zombies, and other disease related stuff.  I don't like **The Walking Dead**, but I'm into zombie fiction.  I had heard of **Black Summer** in relation to **Z Nation**, so I wasn't expecting much.

Well consider me blown away.  **Black Summer** is excellent.

The show takes place 6 weeks after the initial outbreak of runner **'28 Days Later'** style zombies.  It's chaotic, tense, dread-inducing, and a whole lot of fun.  I have heard the show described as, 'That first scene from the **Dawn of the Dead** remake, but stretched over an entire show.'  You're not going to have drawn out character moments, where survivors are at each other's throats over who slept with who.  It's just 'in the moment' survival.  This is accomplished with fantastic sound and camera work, with a overbearing soundtrack that drones in the background and makes you all the more tense.  The camera work is done in a free hand over the shoulder style, and the color grading is blue and dreary.  I love it.

I was surprised to see how divisive the show is, and how it seems a number of people have slept on it.  The main complaint seems to be people disliking the characters because of their 'stupid' actions, such as not closing doors behind them.  This is a familiar trope in a lot of zombie fiction, even popular stuff like **28 Days Later.**  If you can get past the characters making panicked, stupid decisions on the fly, then you're set.  There's one character who seems to be the moron of the group, and there's a whole episode dedicated to him making idiotic, desperate decisions as he is chased around a small town by a single zombie.  It's terrifying, funny, and honestly realistic how most of us would fare in this kind of situation.  There's also complaints around the **'Lord of the Flies'** episode, which I admit could be a hit or miss depending on personal preferences.  I found it goofy and fun, yet believable.  

Some others have seen the value in Black Summer like I have though.  **Stephen King** said this about it, **""BLACK SUMMER (Netflix): Just when you think there's no more scare left in zombies, THIS comes along. Existential hell in the suburbs, stripped to the bone.""** And, **""BLACK SUMMER: No long, fraught discussions. No endless flashbacks, because there's no back story. No grouchy teens. Dialogue is spare. Much shot with a single handheld camera, very fluid. Showrunners could learn a lot from this. If they could work, that is.""**

And The **New York Times** seems to think it's near high art, **“If Andrei Tarkovsky and John Carpenter had teamed up to direct a zombie show, it might have looked something like this formally daring Netflix series.”** I personally think there's not enough pondering on life and what happiness means to be a Tarkovsky film, but I can see where the writer is coming from.  This show is something special, and I really wanna champion it to as many people as I can.

So please, give it a shot!  If you dig the first episode, flaws and all, then you're in for a great ride.",29,1585582913,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/frt3gh/black_summer_is_incredibly_underrated_one_of_the/,television,1

The whole scene was the mother and sons making fun of their parents and how online shopping is complicated. There was something about a piano too.

It just seemed like it broke suspension of disbelief when they'd go from a very non-diagetic shot of a personal moment in a character's home to an interview with them a few shots later.

Well, Tiger King has changed my mind. It's one of the reasons the documentary works so well. *Everything is fucking filmed*.

I watched last weeks episode and like a lot of people I felt like this show was never meant to air with out a studio audience, even though I can't stand shows that have laughter when something isn't that funny (maybe that's why I don't watch it very often). The show tonight didn't have a studio audience and I thought I was in for more of the same.  After watching this episode I realized that I've never once in my life watched something that was so spot on with the facts and also had comedic relief that made me feel better about those facts. At the end of the episode I was laughing so hard that I had to wipe tears from my face, all without a studio audience that told me when I should laugh.

So now, with all this extra time on my hands, I finally got around to watching this series and loved it. 

And of course now I want to watch all those extra “paths” and the bonus episodes. But the app is shut down and I can’t seem to find those scenes anywhere.

frcn7f,Quizlix,Does Netflix influence social media to advertise their shows/films?,"With all this hype around Tiger King, I can’t get my mind off how unnatural some of the promotion is. I would hazard a guess that Netflix is paying accounts on Instagram, Twitter, and probably here to promote their show and subconsciously assert it as something “everyone’s watching” (which, now they are.)

This same phenomenon (overnight explosion of a Netflix show thanks to memes and tweets) happened with Birdbox, Making a Murderer, Fyre Fest, and You off the top of my head.

Of course, I don’t mean to insinuate that most of the web engagement around Tiger King or other shows is illegitimate- I do believe they used paid promotion to “get the ball rolling” however. I think we can all remember the weird influx of Birdbox memes around its time of release. Doesn’t this Carole Haskin Fed Her Husband to Tigers thing remind you of that too?

frccz4,LAudre41,I Highly Recommend Binging AVENUE 5 During this Pandemic,"This show got bad reviews, so I wanted to put my recommendation out there in case anyone is on the fence. It is phenomenal. The best thing I've watched in a longtime. 

Watching the show feels like watching a satire of the current pandemic news cycle. I can take every plot line and  trace it to something currently in the news.  If you're dismayed at the state of the response to the pandemic- watch this show b/c it is comforting to know you're not alone. 

I can't even imagine how I would feel about this show if I watched it before all this happened - I might hate it. But this show feels strangely perfect for this moment. I'll try to summarize a bit below-- there will be minor spoilers, but I won't give too much away.

MINOR SPOILERS BELOW 

Loosely, the show takes place in the future-- a bunch of rich people are vacationing on a rocket ship in space and there is a disaster on the rocket which means the rocket won't return to earth for a longer time than they thought. The rocket is owned by a massive corporation that is owned/run by an Uber-rich moron, who is on the rocket. 


The plot is them dealing with the disaster. Some themes:

* the people in charge don't understand the problem and are not qualified to fix it.
* Those in charge need to control all the people on the rocket and what information gets to them/how to give it to them. 
* The corporation obviously cares less about the people than the company. 
* While everyone is dealing with massive urgent problems, the Uber-rich moron is only concerned with realizing his dumb stupid ideas (and b/c he's in charge everyone has to placate his egotistical stupid needs while trying to solve the actual problem).  [spoiler](#s ""For example, during one episode, everyone is dealing with stopping an oxygen leak and the CEO spends the whole time getting others to arrange a  fireworks show outside - at one point people try to sedate the CEO b/c they realize that they're safer if he can't speak. I could keep going about this- the whole disaster arises out of the CEO trying to force the engineers to fix a delay in the video chats with earth, which the scientists say is unfixable but the CEO still demands they fix."")
* There is a plot line about how if they just kill a bunch of people they can solve some of their problems. It is eerily similar to the arguments made by some in government that we should just let old people die of the virus for the sake of the economy. 

I could go on and on, but this is probably too long already-thanks in advance if you read all this!",20,1585512628,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/frccz4/i_highly_recommend_binging_avenue_5_during_this/,television,0

fra19c,KBlake1982,I really don’t like the show Devs and I really really want to,"The thing I hate the most about it is the way the characters act and talk. I find myself getting really caught up in the notion that “people don’t act like this with each other,” and it’s really distracting. The dialogue is so cheesy and doesn’t reflect reality. 

It bugs me when the actors react to situations that have a IRL baseline on how most humans generally react to them as well. If you witness your wife and child in a car get smashed by another car, the natural human response is to immediately react- physically, facial expressionly, etc. This is just one example. 

I also think think that almost every role is played by an actor that is not good for them. I especially can’t stand The actress who plays Lily. She comes off like she’s acting in an amateur community theater play. The actor that plays the security guard would be better  be more like Mike from breaking bad. I don’t like Nick Offerman’s character portrayal either. Everyone comes off fake to me. I can literally see them acting. I never get lost in the storyline because of this. 

Let me also say that Annihilation became my favorite movie of all time in all my 37 years. I saw it 7 times in theaters and many more on blue ray. I know every scene, every word, every detail. One thing that I have been enjoying with Devs is being able to tie the likeness with the movie- from music, to cinematography, to CGI. One thing I realized when I reflected back to the movie after watching a few episodes of devs, is that the relationships in annihilation are kind of cheesy too. The dialogue also doesn’t resemble what would really transpire between two people of the same relationship. But for some reason in the movie it works. Probably because there isn’t a huge focus on the people and the relationships/dialogue, but mostly the phenomenon.

fr93y9,adiman93,I have watched Season 1 and Season 2 of Yellowstone : Some Thoughts,"The cinematography is fantastic. It looks like a show you would watch at the theaters. It looks wonderful. The acting is great in particular Kevin Costner and Kelly Reilly. I enjoyed the first season better than the second season. Dan Jenkins as an adversary was more fleshed out and better written antagonist compared to the The Beck Brothers for the Dutton Family. There are some similarities in characteristics between this show and Sons of Anarchy. Clay and John, Jax and Kacey , Gemma and Beth , Monica and Tara , Rip and Tig , Juice and Jimmy. The writing in Yellowstone seems more fleshed out and better acted compared to Sons of Anarchy. I can see this show going for another 2-3 seasons at most. Hopefully this show does not over extend its welcome and goes out on a high. Taylor Sheridan has written some very good movies like Sicario , Hell or High Water. Hopefully Kelly Reilly and Kevin Costner get nominated for the Emmys

**Some ideas of Season 3**

1) A law enforcement agent who The Duttons cannot control , someone who is clean and relentless in his pursuit for justice. Someone like Raylan Givens from Justified. Come to think of it a crossover with Justified and Yellowstone would be great

2) We finds out what happened that caused the friction between Beth and Jaime

3) A new Adversary who is just as powerful as The Dutton Family

4) Preferably Less of Tate and Monica and more of Rip , Jimmy 

**Some Thoughts**

Neal McDonough has played the bad guy in a plethora of tv shows. I preferred his work in Justified compared to Yellowstone. Robert Quarles was a more fleshed out character compared to Malcolm Beck. It is time to see Neal headline a tv show, he has the talent to headline a tv show",3,1585501296,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fr93y9/i_have_watched_season_1_and_season_2_of/,television,1

fr8pr7,KalBaratheon,Ozark season 3 is not good,"What *really* happened this season?? They finally get the casino business going, but it's immediately met with FBI intervention. For the rest of the season the main plot thread really goes nowhere. There's no real development on the casino/laundering business because every attempt to move forward is squandered by someone else acting stupid and sneaky. The plot doesn't noticeably develop until the last episode and even then it ends on a cliffhanger. 

And can we talk about the brother?? What a pointlessly dumb character. Why was he even there?? It's like his defining character traits can be summarized as ""contrivance"". And they give him this mental disorder because it's the easist way to validate all his dumb actions. 

*""He needs to be super unstable""* -- bipolar

*""He needs to let his rage control him""* --bipolar

*""He needs to be super naive""* -- bipolar

Seriously, what kind of grown man, bipolar or not, doesn't understand the threat of the cartel??? Like, he really looked shocked when Ruth grabbed the shotgun to protect him. And then when they get to the safe house he just leaves again!! Because he's ""bipolar""!!

Also, notice how lazily some of the plots are resolved?? Whenever things start getting too complicated or hot, the other party just gets killed. That bitter casino owner who was making it difficult for the byrdes? Randomly gets accidentally killed by her husband. The narc who was gathering info for the feds? Randomly gets gunned down. The naive old therapist who was blackmailing the byrdes? Gets killed. Hell, you can even throw the brother in there since they decided to make him such an idiot. 

And why hasn't anybody killed Darlene?? Like, how does this crazy old lady, with no real crew, demand so much respect?? Especially from the cartel??? And what crack did the writers smoke to come up with that wyatt/darlene relationship??? So damn weird....lol

Oh, and did they straight up rip off the Breaking Bad hospital scene?? Like, even the buildup. Just replace Ruth with Jesse, and Tommy with Hank. Tommy beats up Ruth, hospitalizes her, she goes off on the Byrdes, and the relationship is fractured. Hank beats up Jesse, hospitalizes him, he emotionally explodes on Walter, and the relationship is fractured.

fr0niw,LunchboxRadio,"Have Something To Say About ""Kidding"" [Season 1]","I am a thirty year old lesbian.

I have watched a lot of television in my life. I used to review  things for a living, and I used to solely work in film. Television has  healed me, even saved my life at times, such was the case with the  series Wilfred a few years back.

With that being said, I say,  without a hint of irony, sarcasm or anything else, that Showtime's  KIDDING starring Jim Carrey is one of the single best shows I have ever  seen (at least Season 1, as I haven't seen the 2nd yet, but it's got  100% on Rotten Tomatoes so). It is magic  somehow captured on film. It is the single most simultaneously soul  crushing yet relentlessly optimistic thing I've ever watched. It's  disjointed, it's unnerving, it's absolutely beautiful. I cried multiple  times per episode, and the first 10 minutes of the finale paid off one  of the single most seemingly irrelevant yet incredibly cathartic  plotpoints imaginable and had me bawling like a 2 year old.

 It is the first thing I have technically ""binge"" watched in maybe 10  years? I hate doing it and I hate the term, but this was so good I  couldn't stop. I forced myself to only watch 1 or 2 a day to make it  last, but even that was hard. It was like a favorite dessert that also  makes you sick to your stomach; I craved it yet I was terrified to  finish or start a new one.

And I can say that it single handedly  kept me from having my OWN personal breakdown this week and kept me from  hurting myself. Watching Carrey go through his characters breakdown,  seeing the mirroring, somehow allowed me to cope and be alright with the  horribleness this past week has brought to me. It's ""Spark Of Joy""  trailer is one of the single best trailers  I've ever seen as well, and I watched the pilot back when i came out but  since it was a Showtime series I never saw it. Thankfully Season 1  wound up being on Amazon Prime so I got to watch it finally and it was  one of the hardest yet best decisions I've ever made.

Please  watch the show. I hope they get a third season. Despite being  financially strapped I just dropped 20 bucks to own it on DVD because I  know that to keep things I like going I have to support them somehow,  and because of how deeply it touched me. But please watch it. It leaves  Prime on April 1st, so you have until then. There's only 10 episodes,  they're only a half hour a piece, you can-AND SHOULD-treat yourself to  this absolute masterpiece of television.",20,1585459896,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fr0niw/have_something_to_say_about_kidding_season_1/,television,1

fqzn0x,AverageJoeninety,Do you ever miss the way television was experienced in the past? Let me explain....,"I recall TV I the 1970s, 1980s, and into the 1990s.  Back then I never had more than maybe 55 channels, the fewer the earlier in this time line.  Back in the 70s it was probably 13 channels.  No VCRs until the mid 80s.  No digital satellite TV, no PVR.  That is all the stuff of the 21st century.  Back then, when a movie was on, you had to be there to watch it, otherwise you just didn't see it.  Same with any show, actually.  There were re-runs, but you had to wait.

Also back then, with so fewer channels, there were few if any 'speciality channels' that showed programs of only one genre, eg. the country music channels, the Sci-Fi Network, the Golf Channel.  Rather, there were shows that combined many genres like the Ed Sullivan Show or similar variety shows.

Today I have around 400 channels in my TV package.  Most are stuff that does not interest me.  And a huge percentage of the channels are music channels that I never listen to.  I really only watch maybe 30 of my channels.  I also PVR stuff but don't have time to watch it all.  There's too much choice.  Too much content that lacks broad appeal.  TV is just not the same.

What I don't miss is the lousy quality of the picture back then.  Other than that, I actually do miss the golden era of television.",3,1585455287,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fqzn0x/do_you_ever_miss_the_way_television_was/,television,1

fqxcmw,EMPulseKC,"Why should I watch the ""Tiger King"" show on Netflix?","Everyone I know can't stop talking about it, wants to talk to me about it, wonders why I haven't seen it yet, and insists that I watch it as soon as possible.  Even my boss urged me to check it out, yet I hesitate and feel like I still need to be convinced.

I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's for me, but my first impression is no for the following reasons:

1. I don't enjoy ""reality TV,"" including most documentary shows about people.
2. I'm not a fan of when shows have people play up their eccentricities for the cameras in order to hook viewers.
3. I loathe shows that try to appeal to an audience's desire to ridicule and generally look down on people that are different (i.e. unusual personalities and often less-educated members of society.)

I don't know how much that applies to ""Tiger King"" or not, but if so, I don't think I'll like it as much as others do.  If it's way off-base though, I'll check it out.

One thing that you don't usually see in sitcoms: main characters are constantly experiencing serious cruelty. Not ""joke cruelty"" to set up a joke. A real, serious cruelty that is a plot of every episode I've seen so far. This cruelty is used by the show to highlight how a main character is different - how living 15 years in basement has shaped her to be more appreciative. What viewer experiences as untolerable cruelty, Kimmy doesn't see as too bad - compare to her previous life. Things that would make a ""normal person"" cry, is just a normalized standard for Kimmy. This makes for a really ""low key"" gut wrenching scenes.

I didn't expect that. I fucking didn't expect to cry 4 times on the first episode. Last time I cried that much was on Coco.

However they don't seem to be anywhere near the level of popularity nor as highly regarded. Then again two of these shows are very new so it might be hard to properly create a comparison here.

So after the hype train and hate train, to be precise finished, I started watching the show, and I really really liked it. I knew the beats where certain characters die, but who dies when and the general storyline was something I did not know. So the two major complaints were that the mega Zombie-War was really dark and the last episode was the worst one. The Zombie-War episode was really amazing, coz I watched it on Blu-ray and it only looked bad on streaming, but from my deepest conciousness I agree that the last episode was bad, (Also Tryion was kind of a dumb guy the last two seasons) coz all they came up with was to give the throne to all of the fandoms favourite character BrAn.

The changes in Hank's facial expression and body posture are completely different from the other 4 seasons, yet not too much as to seem overdone or caricative. Hank has been dead serious a lot of times throughout the show, but he's never been as serious as *that*. 

Norris is opening a whole new can of emotions, just for that season.

The (mostly) accurate stories told by the drunk narrators is totally hilarious, and is punctuated by the actors lip syncing the ramblings, cursing and forgotten facts only adds to the show.  Many of the actors in the scenes are high profile and do an amazing job of seamlessly blending the rambling and cursing narrative in with the story. 

Interspersed with scenes of the narrators drunkenly explaining the story sometimes spilling drinks, falling over or other drunk activities, while the host (also drunk) tries to sit by stoically or seriously interacting with the narrator, with hilarious results.

fqi8vy,mattiasflgrtll6,Six Feet Under - One of the shows with the most character evolutions?,"The best thing a show can do is either make the characters stay the same while maybe learning a few things along the way...

... or they go through a lot of personality changes, but in a way that always feels believable.

&amp;#x200B;

Six Feet Under is one of the best at doing this. It never lets you make up your mind about a character too easily. For example, at first I found Brenda a fun, mysterious character, before eventually starting to hate her for her narcissistic and hypocritical behavior... and then once she and Nate started taking a break from each other she suddenly became more likable than she'd ever been before.

There's also Rico. At first he seems like a fun-loving, easy-going guy. But even people who seem nice can still have deep-rooted issues underneath. Since he grew up with very conservative values, he got to learn such things as marriage always having to be between a man and a woman. So when he acts repulsed as David finally comes out about his homosexuality, it makes sense.

And then as Vanessa goes into a state of shock after losing his mother, he becomes stressed and impatient and starts screaming at her instead of offering comfort. Of course, this makes him look like an asshole, but it's also true of many people in real life. Some have no idea how to deal with a loved one who's mood changes so dramatically they don't feel like the same person anymore.

Then in season 4 Rico feels so lost in his marriage he pretty much develops a dual personality. He's supportive and caring of Sophia, the woman he's cheating on Vanessa with. Almost too much so in fact. On the other hand, the fact that he's cheating on Vanessa at all makes him unlikable. So his empathetic side resurfaces when he meets another woman to provide for, yet because his empathy is so misplaced he doesn't win the audience's respect back anyway. Interesting, isn't it?

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, what about Billy? In season 1 he was the most disturbing (yet also entertaining) character on the show. At times his psychopathic tendencies are darkly humorous, other times you're terrified. You're constantly on edge with this guy.

As soon as he starts seeking help though, he becomes a lot nicer and stable than before. He's shown as clearly remorseful of his past, and tries his best to make amends for all he's done. Yet, when he reveals to Brenda that he's deeply on love with her, you become alarmed again. Generally he's still a nice fella after this, but you also realize he still has problems that haven't been dealt with yet, and that maybe his healthy recovery won't last for much longer...

&amp;#x200B;

What a gem of a series. Anybody got some other examples?",30,1585394022,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fqi8vy/six_feet_under_one_of_the_shows_with_the_most/,television,1

The suspension of disbelief required for a 'grounded' Batman is significantly more than that required for a Government feed powered all seeing AI that can detect potential threats. This in no way means that PoI didn't take creative liberties with the concept/limitations of AI, but the way it did so was very elegant. And one of the best things about having a TV show is that it allows more time for character development, and that's where PoI truly shined. It almost perfectly justified each character's motivation with a very apt and consistent back stories. Even the recurring /one off characters were so consistent that it truly made you feel for them. That combined with truly intertwined stories that doesn't seemed forced, made me conclude that PoI is the best Batman adaptation of all time.",9,1585393838,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fqi7er/jim_caviezel_is_the_best_batman_change_my_mind/,television,1

fqb5mz,zAceGunnerz,Recommendation for a show that doesn't have nudity or sexual content? Adult violence and language that are not excessive are okay.,"Looking for a show with a compelling narrative the whole family can enjoy. We just finished watching Kingdom on Netflix and Chernobyl on HBO so you can get a vibe of the stuff we enjoy. I have a family ranging from a 14 year old to a 60 year old. Male and female. Immigrant and American born. I was surprised myself to find what we all enjoyed together but just looking for other recommendations. 

Family doesn't have a problem with violence or language to an extent. Obviously nothing over the top and extreme. I forwarded through the nudity scene in Chernobyl and the squeamish family members looked away at the gory scenes in both shows. But they enjoyed the narrative and story a ton. Looking for more content like this others have found worked for multiple family members and exclude sexual content.",7,1585361058,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fqb5mz/recommendation_for_a_show_that_doesnt_have_nudity/,television,1

fqareu,SuspiciouslyLinear,"After finishing Mr. Robot, all I can say is thank you to Sam Esmail and everyone involved","I don't really have much to say. I applaud Sam Esmail and everyone involved for giving us a truly unique piece of storytelling. I always appreciate that in a world dominated by CBS and NBC feel-good shows. But this show did something that I don't think I've ever felt with another show...it forged a connection. A connection to these characters even though they're no more real than fairies and unicorns.

The subject matter is what got me hooked originally, though. Hacking and just technology in general has been an interest of mine since high school. I've never actually hacked before, but this series showed me just how powerful a few lines of code can be and what determination to ruin someone's life through a hack can do. Scary to think about. I didn't really cry at all throughout the series, but I did get a ""I feel you"" moment a few times. Seeing a man genuinely cry just does something to you.

But I guess seeing Elliot finally gain some measure of complete control over his life again in the final episode made me happy for him. To say he's been through a lot would be a huge understatement, obviously. But he deserves to be happy. Sure, he made some drastic mistakes like with the 5/9 attack, but he realizes that and tried everything in his power to fix it. And I respect that hugely.

Finally, I guess I should be thanking all of you. Without your support and keeping this show going, idk what I'd be doing. Probably still stuck in my depression I'm currently in, but I'm trying to get out of it. This show made me realize that yes, humans suck. We will continue to destroy and hurt ourselves no matter how perfect the world becomes. That's just who we are. So yes, fuck society. But don't say fuck you to the ones close to you. They're what matters most in this world, not what a president said on tv or what someone posted on Twitter or Facebook. As cheesy as it sounds, time and love are two of the most powerful things we have and need. This show made me realize that.",50,1585359598,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fqareu/after_finishing_mr_robot_all_i_can_say_is_thank/,television,1

fpzmv8,pm_me_reason_to_livx,Unorthodox (Netflix) is a gripping tale of a Hasidic woman finding solace beyond her religious limitations.," From one religious based series to another, seems like that's all I've been watching lately as my previous watch [Kalifat](https://www.reddit.com/user/pm_me_reason_to_livx/comments/fplhdt/kalifat_svt1/) is also an examination of a strict and restrictive religion and how its fundamentalism can change the way people think or in this case, shape their lives entirely. The situations and topics presented in Kalifat are far more dangerous, but Netflix' 4-part miniseries Unorthodox shows just how harmful a closed-minded religion can be, even when not obsessed with the destruction of non-believers. Call me ignorant or uneducated, but I seriously had no idea Hasidic Judaism (or ""Unorthodox/Ultra-orthodox Judaism"" or ""Hasidism"") was even a thing before this series. I thought those men walking around New York with those quirky fur hats and tacky hairstyles were all rabbis or some shit. I had no idea there was whole religion and culture behind them, especially not one with such limitations and restrictive lifestyles. It's unbelievable really, the thought of young adults/teenagers in the 21st century not knowing how to use a smartphone, or how to browse the internet, or that foreplay is a thing.... or that sex can be done in more than one position. 

Unorthodox goes in-depth on what it is like to be a Hasidic woman as the self-identifying and freedom-discovering story unfolds for our main character Esty. It's a very well-produced, well-shot series with some very vibrant and unfiltered visuals, but I do have a few slight peeves with it. While the directing is excellent I kinda dislike the flashback-format they opted to use to tell the story. The flashback scenes don't always add something (though it often do), and are sometimes quite interrupting in getting the full effect of Esty's solace. I would've much preferred if they presented the story chronologically from Esty's wedding building up to her eventually fleeing to Berlin. That probably would require more episodes to be well paced though, which is my next slight issue, I felt it could've went 4 more episodes. The plot is nuanced but it felt like there were stuff they couldn't go in-depth on because of limited run-time. 

As is the 4 episodes of Unorthodox are well constructed. It's gripping, even when there are some hard to watch moments like that gawd awkward sex scene. There are some excellent performances as well, Shira Haas was great, and Amit Rahav was just perfect playing a naive grown-ass man-child. Unorthodox is essential viewing and it's hard for me to say otherwise. As much as it might not appeal to a wide range audience, it very insightful and also very impactful for such a short series.

fpw4vg,BlackfishShane,Why get invested in Netflix shows?,"It feels like there is either a 2 year gap, or more, between seasons or a show is cancelled after 2/3 seasons.

Ozark for example. Season 3 releases today. Season 2 released on the 31st of August 2018. I really enjoy the show but for the life of me I cannot remember what happened in that show 2 years ago.

Same problem with Altered Carbon. Season 1 release date: February 2nd 2018. Season 2? February 27th 2020. Over two years.

Paradise PD (Don't judge me, it's brainless fun!) has the same problem. Over two years between seasons.

Then the cancellations. Santa Clarita Diet is the big one people talk about. It seemed to have developed a cult following. The cast and writing was fantastic. Season 3 ended with a teaser. Boom, cancelled.

And with all the ridiculousness going on right now, I suppose that I would like something similar to sink into as a bit of comfort viewing.

So, any TV show recommendations out there for something similar? As I have thought about this for a bit, I have realized that this isn't as easy for me to nail down as I might have first thought: small town or village in scenic, rural setting, interesting locals, good dialogue, funny without being constant comedy, strong sense of place...

The only things that I have been able to come up with are: Northern Exposure, Letterkenny (although, that is so dialogue driven, that I don't feel like it gets around to the other qualifiers as much)...The Andy Griffith Show?

The Tony Awards, a longtime pinnacle for Broadway achievement, have been postponed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that shuttered the Great White Way.

The show was originally set to take place June 7 at Radio City Music Hall and broadcast live on CBS. Its presenters are now working towards rescheduling the ceremony following Broadway’s ongoing shutdown.

“The health and safety of the Broadway community, artists and fans are of the utmost importance to us,” organizers shared in a [**statement**](https://www.tonyawards.com/news/74th-annual-tony-awards-be-postponed/). “We will announce new dates and additional information once Broadway opens again.

I loved every episode, and you could tell the writer had a great idea with a fantastic story and a very clever twist. It should have ended there. Season two tried to recreate this and was somewhat successful, but it just didn’t work like the first season. Even the great Carrie Coon couldn’t save the show. Season three was just horrible. It was almost unwatchable and completely ridiculous. It felt like I was watching a completely different series. It actually kinda ruined the whole series for me, because of just how completely awful it was.

The phrase derives from a scene in a Season 5 episode of the 1970s sitcom Happy Days in which the character Fonzie jumps over a shark while on water-skis. This gimmick strayed absurdly outside the original storyline of the sitcom.

Not that this is surprising considering new things also dominate genres like movies and music.

fppaw2,IsaiahTrenton,I Just Finished Tiger King and I Need to Discuss (SPOILERS),"So I finished watching Tiger King and I had a lot of thoughts about it....

1) The sex cult/polygamy thing needed a lot more emphasis in my opinion. Maybe it's because I would also like several cute strung out white boys jonesing for my dick. But that's the part that stuck with me the most. I wish Doc was in it more because that whole set up was WILD and despite him claiming he's not banging anyone I disagree. He clearly has some hold over these women. Also I really wanted more info on exactly what was going on with the straight guys or rather 'straight' guys Joe had suckered in. I felt like that needed more examination than it got. 

2) Though the topic itself was fascinating the actual editing and construction of this documentary was honestly piss poor and probably an hour longer than it needed to be. As much as I found the Carol killing her husband thing to be interesting it contributed nothing to the overall narrative, if you can call it that, of the piece. The last three episodes could have been two episodes and they needed a lot clearer focus because the timeline jumped around like crazy. I had a hard time following the sequence of events at times and that definitely contributed to my lack of investment. Honestly the last two episodes were just a slog and not super interesting.

3) I really didn't care as much about the Carol vs Joe shit as I thought I would. Some of the other characters in this were vastly more interesting such as Jeff, Doc, Monkey Man, Kathy Bates Man and the drug lord. After a while the Joe vs Carol shit became stale. I wish they had sought out more former women who worked for Doc or other Big Cat owners. 

4) I am SOOOOOOO glad no Black people were involved in the making of this series! At first I was a little offended neither Doc or Joe had any Black side pieces but then I snapped myself out of it and realized this was not the hill to die on. 

5) With that said, between the Fyre Festival documentaries, Abducted in Plain Sight and this series I've learned if you're a charismatic white man you can get away with just about anything and convince people to do just about anything. Shit white women too because Carol, good intentions aside, seemed to be a bit shady and out there in her own respect. I think if she weren't a pretty blonde in the 90's she would be in some serious shit right now.

6) How did Joe not get ANY charges concerning Travis? Like clearly he was coercing and drugging this boy into staying. He was being kept prisoner. And if it's clear he was afraid of Joe. The other Bumpkin Bottom left and seemed to have more agency. Travis quite literally was being held against his will. He killed himself on purpose in my opinion and even if not exactly on purpose he had lost the will to live. I wish the series had drawn more parallels to how Travis was being treated in comparison to the animals. He was caged and used for amusement too and he took the only way out he could. There's gotta be some charges the mom could've pursued. Again if this were a Black man holding a young white boy against his will I feel like this story would've ended differently. 

7) They glossed over Joe and Dillion's relationship like a motherfucker. Why is this kid so ride or die? What's his story? Where is his family? Why is this poor child tied into this? Why was there no further examining of his thoughts? I feel like Joe had to have promised this boy something. What's the story here? Also chat rooms? In 2018?

8) A little follow up and closure to Barbara's story would've been nice. I felt so bad for her. I wanted to know that she had found a career she enjoyed and someone who genuinely loved her. I've never been so invested in a white woman's personal happiness. There needed to be more interviews with the current woman Doc was most assuredly giving his old sausage too. Would've brought home the point better to me. 

9) The Dog the Bounty Hunter looking fucker, the armless transman, the campaign manager and the double amputee dude seemed to be some of the only decent people in story. Everyone else either was drugged out to oblivion or actively manipulative fucks.

10) A lot of plot points either went nowhere or were dropped for no reason. I'm mainly referring to Jeff and the Kathy Bates guy. The fight between monkey man and Jeff seemingly came out of nowhere with foreshadowing. If we had to have seven episodes, then more time spent on reforming the zoo after Joe left would've been nice because that seemed to have gotten dropped. Or maybe it didn't but the choppy editing just threw me off. 

11) Lastly, why didn't the fake hitman dude get in trouble for lying on the stand? That seems like something that would've come up while analyzing the evidence. For that matter, why did Joe take the stand because I can almost assure you that's what sunk him. Do lawyers not have control or whether their clients testify or not? Also I thought Toothless left in like 2014 so how was he around to testify concerning things that happened after he left?",16,1585277499,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fppaw2/i_just_finished_tiger_king_and_i_need_to_discuss/,television,1

fpn294,WesternNinja0,Should I (18M) watch A Different World?,"Earlier today I saw that all 6 seasons of A Different World were on Amazon Prime Video. I am interested watching the show, but I'm not sure. Here are factors going into my decision:

1. Bill Cosby 
How connected to the show was he? I really don't want to watch something he was heavily involved in due to...you know. I did light research and saw that he's credited as creator, wrote zero episodes, and appeared in 3 season 1 episodes. Does he earn any money from me watching it on prime? Is the Bill Cosby connection light enough that I can watch this show guilt free?

2. Quality
Is the show good and worth investing time into? Not that how old a show is affects it's quality, but I tend to prefer watching newer sitcoms. I have watched some Seinfeld, Friends, and Frasier. I've (somehow) seen all of Cheers. If Friends and Frasier aren't quite my taste, what about this show. How modern does it feel?

3. Cosby Show Continuity 
I haven't seen a full episode of The Cosby Show and don't really want to. I tend to be a  bit of a stickler for continuity, but does it really matter in this case? I already know that Lisa Bonet is the only regular in both shows and left A Different World after season 1, so it doesn't seem to matter much.

I know I can watch whatever I want, but what're your thoughts, Reddit?

fpkni9,pm_me_reason_to_livx,Kalifat (SVT1),"Now as surreal as topics like female oppression, religious-indoctrination, and propaganda within the bounds of Shahria laws  etc. may feel when watching a series like Kalifat, you sometimes have to stop and remember that these are things that are actually happening in the real world. That's what makes Kalifat so unbelievably jarring to me even when it isn't. I really can't imagine anyone leaving countries like Sweden, Norway etc. to go live in the war-riddled, tensed environment of Syria/Iraq all in the name of religion, but they do. I can't imagine anyone's mind being so susceptible to religion especially one as strict and ruthless like ISIS' version of Islam, but people are. 

Based on an original idea by Wilhelm Behrman, who created the series together with Niklas Rockström, Kalifat centers on five young women, whose fate is intertwined in an examination of how religious fundamentalism can seduce individuals and destroy lives. Set in 2015 simultaneously in Stockholm and ISIS-occupied Raqqah, it shows just how religious brainwashing and propaganda can be applied to anyone who's willing to listen. In contrast the series also shows how restrictive and oppressive it can be for women in the Islamic state, in very frightening fashion at that. So basically the series presents two scenarios, women trying to leave the Islamic State and those trying to get in. 

While Channel 4's The State had a simple, easy to understand structure with it's depiction of ISIS and how their system work, Kalifat feels like a much more genuinely realistic series compared to that. Shot in the style of The Wire (but with a lot more close-up shots), this series is designed to make the viewer think that what they're seeing actually happened. There are no forced drama, limited use of music (only soundtrack) unless it's playing off a device, and no dream sequences that take you out of the reality that has been created. Visually and production-wise (in terms of sets, location etc.) it's good enough though not the greatest, but makes up for it with superb writing and some very impressive acting. 

Kalifat starts slow-paced but then process to build tension and suspense, all leading to a very nail-biting gut-wrenching finale. With each episode the sense of danger around this series gets deeper and deeper, you can't help but feel for these 5 young ladies and their situation though some would say they brought it upon themselves. By the end your heart will break for some, while you'll despise others for their lack of awareness with no regret. With such nuance and insight Kalifat is a really good watch, must-see in fact. It's the series that would've done wonders with a high-budget, but they worked with what they got and the end result is great.

    rating: 8.5 out of 10

fpec2f,HG88,Devs. Enjoying it but holy crap the lead female is awful.,"I’ve been giving her a pass because I thought she was just playing the character, who is going through this terrible situation, so fair enough she’s in shock and kind of just blah. 

 I’m watching episode five right now. There’s a flashback where the russian bf says I love you. She delivers the line “Whoa, that’s the first time one of us has said that” with as little emotion as could possibly be given. No tone, no inflection, no excitement, no nervousness. Literally as dry and blank as it could be said. 

In fact I would challenge someone to attempt to say that any more blankly and emotion-less than she did.

fpdl3w,concretebox,Amazon's Hunters stupid mistake that (nearly) all action shows make," 

When you notice it, it will ruin nearly everything you watch. Two characters are fighting, maybe there is one gun, maybe they each have one, but in the scene they are clearly trying to kill each other, but the moment one gets the upper hand (and/or the gun), they stop trying to kill each other and have a chat. It's dumb when the good guy does it and it's frickin re-donk-ulas when the villain does it.

The most recent example of this done very poorly was the Amazon show Hunters. In that show they have ""real world"" gun battles in most episodes, but in a critical scene near the end of the season Character A doesn't pull the trigger only because Character B is needed for season two.",2,1585237033,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fpdl3w/amazons_hunters_stupid_mistake_that_nearly_all/,television,1

Young lady rents out basement apartment to a suave, successful, good looking dude? He is planting cameras all over the house and spying on her, taking control of her life, oh and also...HES A PSYCHO MURDERER! 

And they ALL play out EXACTLY the same. They have ONE template and just repeat it over and over. 

The pycho murderer ties up our heroine, loosely, so he can gloat. She undoes the ties and hits him in the head with a shovel or something other tool. She runs away. Thats it. They all end the same way.

fpcqrp,MortalWombat1974,Stop me if you've heard this one before: Let's talk lazy action tropes (minor spoiler for the season finale of Picard),"I want to state my opinion up front, for the record, that I think Picard is a very well written show, and I'm not just saying that because it's got some famous and highly experienced writers on board. 

Ricard is s ambitious, generally doesn't patronize the audience, is well paced, and is mature in a sense more interesting than merely depicting people ingesting cannabis products and saying the word ""fuck"".

...but. (minor spoiler ahead)



There is a scene in the last episode of this first season where Seven of Nine confronts the Romulan spy Narissa. Seven has a phaser pistol.  Narissa is unarmed. Seven foolishly closes the distance between them to disarm her, and the inevitable kung fu kicking ensues.

Why? 

This is a bit we've seen done literally thousands of times, from  virtually the historical start of action scenes being shot in motion pictures. 

It's something armed police officers have been trained NOT to do now for many decades.  

So why do excellent writers on a quality show expect the audience to buy into a highly experienced military officer from centuries in the future endangering her life by ignoring her training? 

It's straight up lazy, and I don't just blame the people who make make our tv shows and movies.  

I blame us as the audiences for meekly accepting this as ""just a bit of fun"", ""part of the magic of tv/cinema"", or whatever other trite load of bollocks we use to gloss over minor imperfections in otherwise well made media.

I get that time is always a concern, but how hard is it to write your way around this garbage trope? 

I'd rather see some macho pride bullshit where the gun holder tosses it away, because she wants to beat the crap out of her adversary, than have to believe she's suddenly become stupid and bad at her job.

I invite anyone reading this to tell me how I'm wrong, or to add your own rants about other lazy tropes  that take you out of the story(on any tv show), and should go and join the dinosaurs in the land of extinction.",4,1585234112,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fpcqrp/stop_me_if_youve_heard_this_one_before_lets_talk/,television,1

Every scene pulls you deeper and deeper into this world. Everything is revealed to us slowly - first the smaller details before expanding - the setting, the rules of the park, the host loops, and then finally politics in management. It all fits together so well and by the end of the episode with Dolores swatting the fly, we finally begin understand the broader direction of the story. This is a story of awakening. It's unique, intriguing and just incredibly detailed. 

Even though I'm still enjoying the show two seasons on, it feels like it's missing that - not sure what else to call it but elegance that made the first season and this premiere episode so great.

fp5bri,kevonicus,"If you liked X-Files, I highly recommend History Channel’s Project Blue Book.","It starts out kind of based on actual events and and documented cases, then veers off into that not meaning much as it gets more sci-fi, but it definitely scratches that X-Files or Fringe vibe if you’ve been missing that. The past few episodes have been great and made me want to make this post. It’s definitely worth checking out if you like the shows I mentioned. I thought it was gonna be more of a exaggerated history show based on UFO sightings, but it actually has evolved into a legit sci-fi show.",12,1585197465,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fp5bri/if_you_liked_xfiles_i_highly_recommend_history/,television,1
fp55rl,Laenic,Cross Network Crossovers?,"Have there ever been cross network crossovers that aren't caused by the same production company?

I only ask because in tonight's episode of Chicago PD Upton gets sent to New York to assist the FBI with an operation. So next week would be a crossover between Chicago PD on NBC and FBI on CBS. I know it only worked out because Wolf Entertainment is the production company behind both of the shows, but with this crossover it makes it canon that Law and Order, The Chicago shows, FBI and FBI Most Wanted exist in the same universe. I know that the CBS shows have previously crossover episodes with NCIS and the sister shows, NCIS:LA and Hawaii 5-O, and Hawaii 5-O and Magnum PI and NBC crossed over with One Chicago, PD and SVU and all the L&amp;O shows. Based on previous evidence I would assume that all the CBS shows exist in the same universe and presumably that in the 2020-2021 season there would be a crossover event on the network.

But I was wondering if this has ever happened before without the same production company behind it?

foyfkf,IISuperSlothII,"Sports are cancelled, how about some Sports Anime to fill the void","While we're all locked in our homes with no sport to keep us sane on the weekends now feels like the time to recommend some sports anime to watch in lieu. Because if you name a sport, there's probably an anime of it. 

The idea of using as sport to tell a story seems to be lost in western TV, movies embrace it (gotta rec some of those later as well) but tv itself seems to ignore it, or uses the backroom aspect (like Ballers) to create drama, which isn't necessarily bad, but theres just something about watching a team grow from the bottom and fight there way to the top, even if they fail to reach the title of champions. Anime has a ridiculous amount of series that does just that I think a lot of them will even appeal to those who just see anime as over the top super powered shenanigans, especially with how  down to earth some of the shows are.

And on that note;

# My Personal Recommendations

**Run with the Wind** *\[Crunchyroll, HiDIVE\]*

English dub in the works, no current release date / Complete Adaptation \[23 eps\]

*Long Distance Running*

 [A good video to get a feel for the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUFEi3vPSCM)

    The biggest complaint with most of these shows is going to be, they aren't complete and they're just about high school students, so I'll start with one that is neither of those. Adaptated from a novel at the end of 2019 Run with the Wind tells the complete story of 10 university students of varying skill levels (from nationally ranked to just going above walking pace is an achievement) who aim to compete in the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance relay race up the mountain of Hakone where each runner completes about 20km each. 
    
    Honestly I just rewatched this show and it's definetly a 10/10 for me, come the half way point I think it'll have most viewers at least a bit teary eyed, seeing the team grow just for the opportunity to compete is so endearing, and is only helped by the wonderful cast of characters, ranging from the always pissed off Kakeru, to the wholesome exchange student Musa to the smoking adicted Nico (who yes, is nicknamed nico after his addiction to Nicotine) as the cast live together in student acommodation it allows us to them connect in varying different situations and seeing them get pissed in the kitchen at the end of the night is bound to bring back memories of living in halls at university.
    
    There's a lot that makes this show simply great and if I can get just one person to check it out I'll be happy.

**Haikyuu!!** *\[Crunchyroll ,HiDive, Netflix\]*

English dub of seasons 1-3, no date on season 4 / Source ongoing, Season 4 currently airing \[85 eps+\]

*Volleyball*

[Once again a good video to get a feel for the show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqtNS2zI8tc)

    I might sound crazy, but this is honestly my favourite work of fiction in general. It just nails the characters, comedy, pacing, hype (which is why it's called Hypekyuu) and even reading the currently ongoing manga never seems to lose it's luster, which is surprising for 8 years of weekly storytelling with very little breaks. 
    
    This show follows a high school team called Karasuno, who are sort of middle of the road, were once among the best teams in their area but have fell off recently, so the story documents their growth to become among the best again and compete at nationals. It's a simple premise but it executes it so well you can't help to cheer for these characters as you would for a normal team, this show has literally brought me to the edge of my seat, cheering for the team as I do when I'm watching Liverpool, with just less shouting at the screen when they mess up (thankfully there hasn't been much need for that this year). 
    
    I could go on about this show for too long and these descriptions are getting to long so I'm gonna cut it off here, I swear the rest will be shorter. Just watch Haikyuu!! shits good.

**Chihayafuru** *\[Crunchyroll, HiDive\]*

English Dub of seasons 1 &amp; 2 on HiDive / Source Ongoing, Season 3 finished yesterday, now our watch for season 4 begins. \[74 eps\]

*Karuta*

    First up you're probably asking wtf the Karuta!? And to be perfectly honest, I can't really explain it succintly enough to be worth writing it, all you need to know is it's a poetry card game that involves heavy memorisation and quick reflexs (with lots of other strategic elements), it's a niche sport in Japan so you're not expect to go in with hype for the sport, but don't worry because the cast and visuals will be more than enough to get you invested.
    
    Chihihayafuru follows a high school girl (Chihaya) as she aims to both win nationals with the club she scrounged together with one of her friends from elementary school (Taichi) and to fight for the top rank of a female Karuta player, Queen. It presents many different perspectives with players aiming for different goals as it straddles between drama, romance and action. It's really hard show to sell, but a fucking easy one to enjoy.

**Stars Align** *\[Funimation\]*

English dub on Funimation / Original Story \[12 eps\]

*Soft Tennis*

    This is one of the few shows that don't use a source material, but unfornately is incomplete due to studio interference cutting the original 24 episodes down to 12 midway through production, even so the 12 episodes we got are absolutely worth a watch.
    
    Stars Align is definetly more character drama, as we see characters who are products of child abuse, struggle with idenity issues and find difficulty in reconciling being adopted, it presents many issues and deals with them in a mature and satisfying way. You might be surprised at how such a simple story can be so effective at making you feel for this cast of characters.

# Quickfire Shows for Different Sports 

*I haven't seen all these so I can't recommend them as such, will just put the synopsis where appropiate.*

# Football/Soccer

**Giant Killing** *\[No official stream\]*

No English dub \[26 Eps\]

    East Tokyo United (ETU) has been struggling in Japan's top soccer league for the past few years. It has taken everything they have just to avoid relegation. To make matters even worse, the team has lost five matches in a row, leading to abysmal team morale. Even the fans are beginning to abandon them, and rumors hint that the home ground municipality is going to withdraw their support. With countless coaches fired and poor financial choices in hiring players, it is a downward spiral for ETU.

**Days** *\[Crunchyroll\]*

Apparently has a dub \[24 eps\]

     Days (TV)The series is about two boys named Tsukushi and Jin. Tsukushi is a boy with no special talent or traits while Jin is considered a soccer genius. On one stormy night, Jin meets Tsukushi, and they get dragged into the world of soccer.

# Basketball

**Kuroko no Basket** *\[Crunchyroll\]*

Has a dub, but not exactly sure where / Complete Adaptation \[75 Eps &amp; 1 Film\]

    Teikou Junior High School's basketball team is crowned champion three years in a row thanks to five outstanding players who, with their breathtaking and unique skills, leave opponents in despair and fans in admiration. However, after graduating, these teammates, known as ""The Generation of Miracles"", go their separate ways and now consider each other as rivals.
    
    This one does go into the realm of superpowers a bit.

**Slam Dunk** *\[Crunchyroll\]*

Has a dub, but was never finished and this anime is from the 90s so no chance the dub will ever be finished / Unsure if the adaptation is complete \[101 eps\]

    The series tells the story of a teenager called Hanamichi Sakuragi who falls in love with a girl named Haruko Akagi, and decides to enter the Shohoku High School Basketball Team in order to attract her as she is already in love with another Shohoku player, Kaede Rukawa. As Sakuragi starts learning how to play basketball, he, however, starts to like the sport.

**Ahiru no Sora** *\[Crunchyroll, HiDIVE\]*

Dubbed on HiDIVE / Show still airing, 50 episodes ordered for first season 

    Lacking what is considered the most important asset in basketball, Sora Kurumatani has struggled with his short height since the inception of his love for the game. Despite missing this beneficial aspect, Sora's unwavering drive never allowed his small stature to dictate his ability to play, believing strongly in trying his hardest and persistently practicing to prove his capability.

# Baseball

**Diamond no Ace** *\[Crunchyroll\]*

No English dub / Season 2 currently airing \[125 eps\]

    With a stray pitch that completely missed the batter, Eijun Sawamura loses his final middle school baseball game. Frustrated by this defeat, Eijun and his teammates vow to reach the national tournament once they are in high school. But everything changes when a scout unexpectedly invites him to Tokyo's prestigious Seidou High School after seeing the potential in his unusual pitching style. Encouraged by his teammates, Eijun accepts the offer, ready to improve his skills and play at a much more competitive level of baseball.

**Cross Game** *\[Viz Media, faux sequel/side story Mix: Meisei Story streaming on Funimation, can be watched without seeing Cross Game*

No English dub for Cross Game, Mix dubbed on Funi 

    Kou Kitamura and Aoba Tsukishima are often at odds—even though their families happen to be close friends and business partners. Although the only child of a sports shop owner, Kou has never been interested in playing baseball. Despite this, he possesses an impressive batting ability honed by frequent visits to the local baseball batting center run by the Tsukushima family. On the other hand, Aoba loves to play baseball and is a star player with exceptional pitching form.

**Major** *\[The sequel story following the main characters son is on Crunchyroll, the original is on the high seas\]*

No English dub to my knowledge / 6 seasons, 3 ovas and a sequel story with 2 seasons \[A fuck ton of episodes\]

     Gorou Honda, a little boy obsessed with baseball, has always admired his father, Shigeharu. Wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Gorou dreams of becoming a professional baseball player. In turn, his son's starry-eyed admiration encourages Shigeharu to keep persevering, despite his late wife's death and his unsatisfying position on the second-string team Blue Ocean.
    
    Unfortunately, an elbow injury forces Shigeharu off the team, and he falls into despair. However, after an offhand joke from his childhood friend, Shigeharu reevaluates his choices and decides to keep playing, leaving behind his prime position as pitcher and taking up the bat. Now motivated more than ever, Gorou works hard to carve his way in the Japanese Little League.
    
    By S5 Gorou is playing in the States as a pro player, so expect a lot of growth over the 6 seasons

# Bonus [Fake Sports]

Along with having a show for the majority of sports (and if you dip into manga I'm not sure how many stones would be left unturned, but that's not a rabbit hole I want to go down) anime likes to make it's own sports. Whether it's freerunning races with Prince of Stride, Girls in Tank Warfare with Girls und Panzer or girls smack the shit out of each other with their ass and tiddies hijinks of Keijo (yes that's a thing...) but there's one show I really want to bring attention to.

**Megalo Box** *\[Crunchyroll, Toonami, All4(UK)\]*

Has a dub but with no Legal Stream to my knowledge besides All4 in the UK. (Never thought I'd be writing that, fair play Channel 4)  and tbh just having  a quick listen, it's a bloody good dub.

*Mechanical Arm Boxing*

[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVxLZityaR0)

    This is actually a 50th anniversary show for Ashita no Joe, based on a futuristic sport of mechanical arm boxing. The show oozes style, is an original story and has had a sequal announced, it's definitely a perfect storm people who don't like anime will probably still like it. 
    
    If anything else at least give this show a go, it's 13 episodes and tells a complete story, I can't recommend it enough, even if I may be failing at selling it, it's people beating the shit out of each other with mechanical arms though, it should really sell itself. 

# Bonus Movies

As an extra bonus, if you're after some sports movies to watch, I have to recommend **The Damned United** which follows Brian Clough (Michael Sheen) during his time at Leeds United after a successful stint with Derby County. 

And more recently **Rush** which follows the story of James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) in F1 when Niki got into a major accident which left him with Horrible Scars, it's a ridicolously good film directed by Ron Howard.",22,1585170971,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/foyfkf/sports_are_cancelled_how_about_some_sports_anime/,television,1

Sunny I can’t name specifics, I noticed it at least twice awhile back but I don’t recall the scenes. I’m pretty sure it was removal and not a change.

Parks and Rec is what made me post, there is a scene where Mark decides he’s going to tell Anne all of his skeletons and the line before was “I smoked a lot of pot in college, I’m not proud of it and...” before he gets cut off. Then I see this episode again and he says “I smoked a lot of pot in college, it wasn’t that much but” then gets cut off.

folqeh,RusevReigns,This Is Us directing is underrated,"This Is Us series finale had a big climactic fight between Kevin and Randall where how it was filmed added a lot to the scene (apparently all in one take). Many people are fans of how TV’s directing and artistic style has improved over the last few decades, however This Is Us does not always get the credit that something like Better Call Saul or True Detective would for example.  


\- Its editing is crucial, I would argue more important for it than 95%+ of shows due to how they have to mix in the past storylines with the present ones. Furthermore unlike Lost where you might spend 10 minutes on present followed by airplane noise and 10 minutes on flashback, This Is Us is more challenging editing wise as it may jump from present to past to present within a single scene to show how the characters are feeling. Even in the present scenes editing is still important to jump around to the three characters storylines in the episode. An example of an episode that took a lot of editing was the recent one where they visited New York at three different ages.

\- I would argue This Is Us has recognizable cinematography. Something of a naturalistic feel, like the camera is in the room with the person, instead of stagey. Add in its famous obsession with acoustic adult contemporary songs hate it or love it, and I would say This Is Us has a visual and soundtrack feel to itself, and easy to either imitiate or [parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H8B1EUGkDo).

\- It has dipped its toes in dream type sequences from time to time.  


I would argue for example, that This Is Us is making more directing decisions than Game of Thrones, which is a good show that I always struggled with the editing as it felt like the episodes were put together as “5 minute block on Character A, then 5 minute block on Character B, then 5 minute block on Character C” rather than decisions being made to put it all together somehow. And while the battle scenes were very impressive, I don’t think the characters talking to each other the other 95% of the show in scenes like King’s Landing was filmed in any special way. That’s not to say GOT NEEDED lavish directing or editing, the show is supposed to feel somewhat Shakespearean actor-y which you could argue doesn’t need any more than just placing the camera in front of people and letting them do their thing. And there are shows that go all out trying to direct things with over the top tracking sequences that make me roll their eyes, so it’s not always a good thing compared to the simplicity of some of GOT scenes. But I just wanted to bring up the example since “This Is Us is more heavily directed than Game of Thrones” is not something I’m sure many people would realize.",5,1585118876,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/folqeh/this_is_us_directing_is_underrated/,television,1

1. A cheap Rode shotgun mic plus a Zoom HN1 (or above) will make a HUGE difference in the audio quality.

2. Partner with Zoom, Twitch, Google or someone and sell virtual tickets for people to ""watch the taping"". If you can get the laughing audio, great. If not, at the very least the performance will have much better energy. If selling tickets is too risky (ie problematic viewers) then have staff watch/laugh via video chat.",7,1585109344,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fojvov/serious_suggestion_for_late_night_shows_filming/,television,1

foi0kp,scarfacesaints,All American on Netflix is the perfect example of a bad good TV show,"From IMDB: ""Spencer James is a rising high school football player and A student at South Crenshaw High, but when coach Billy Baker recruits him to join his team in Beverly Hills, Spencer's mother, Grace, and his best friend, Coop, convince him it's an opportunity he has to seize. Forced to move in with Billy and his family to protect his transfer permit to Beverly, Billy's son Jordan, who is also the starting quarterback, is less than thrilled to be sharing his father's attention -- or the team spotlight. While Spencer struggles to find his footing, he makes an unlikely friend in Jordan's sister, who is struggling with her own demons.""

Shows like this are so incredibly frustrating because the story is good, the characters are good...but the execution is just so bad.

The pacing is all over the place. They could have a good concise story told over a few season, but it seems like everything is being crammed in as quickly as possible.

Everything is an emotional peak or valley. Nobody is just normal. Everyone hates someone one minute, and loves them the next..for the dumbest reasons. Someone will get super mad about something that doesn't warrant that kind of reaction.

Every episode:

""I hate you! I never want to talk to you!"" (fist fight optional)

2 seconds later

""I love you, you're my best friend!""

-or-

""That's none of your business! I don't need to tell you anything""

2 second later

""Sit down, let's talk. It's about time I told you""

-or-

""I can't tell them, it'll hurt them too much""

2 seconds later

""Hey guys, I have something to tell you..""

All the dialogue is so far from how normal people talk in any type of relationship: Mother/daughter, Father/son, Friends, Husband/wife...so on. None of it sounds natural.

fohmfv,Hieillua,Spoilers: I'm starting to lose hope in the quality of writing in Westworld,"It still a fine show. But it has become pretty silly. Should've been a one season mini series or an anthology series imo. I really feel like the plot has no idea where it should be going. 

The most interesting part of the show was the awakening of the hosts. Now we're getting a saving the world storyline, naughty AI, simulations within simulations, its becoming all muddled and the way the story handles them doesn't feel as tightly written as season 1. 

The action is also pretty silly. Guys have a gun... they run away from an axe wielder. Killer robot charging at you? Walk towards it! The Maeve pill poke in the eye was also so silly, could've just been her finger. The action was also a problem in season 1, but that happened towards the end with terrible security doing a terrible job clearing rooms. But that was a minor thing. I easily excused that and called people critiquing that nitpickers, but it has become more than an incident, bad action is the rule now, not an exception.

The show used to be more intriguing and more cleverly written. Anthony Hopkins was captivating. The storyline was mysterious and smart. Sizemore being reborn as a Host for example was so phoned in now. It's become a trick. Everybody is becoming a Super Saiyan. Bernard being a Host in season 1 was far more amazing. It becomes cheaper and cheaper. 

Season 2 already had me doubting, besides from 1 masterful episode (which also proved to me the show could thrive being about a different bunch of characters each season. The native American Host was great. His whole story could've been a season long storylines next other storylines, connecting things back to Anthony Hopkins' character. Like how Fargo is thinly connected to certain characters in that universe). Season 3 so far hasn't done it for me. Dolores doesn't intrigue me. You can also tell the writers are trying to find things to do for characters, it doesn't feel organic to me. Which is disappointing because I'm a BIG Jonathan Nolan fan because of Person of Interest, where he handled topics like AI, machine learning etc. far better with also better written characters. 

Example of meh writing: Bernard is here. Now he is there. Just stroll into Westworld... unbothered... weird, especially after what happened there. You'd at leadt expect him to think, huh, this was easy. First ep of the season: aaron pauls character robs an atm machine... they walk straight from it, across the cops that were driving to it. They didn't see them? How? Lots of logic holes imo. It feels so silly. Even if it turns out Aaron Pauls character is in some sort of future world and the cops ignoring him walking away is cheesy Sizemore esque writing, it still doesn't feel satisfying while watching it before having that knowledge. Him just happening to stumble upon Dolores is also the type of convienent writing I'm tired of. It feels like D&amp;D season 7/8 writing.

fobobp,LionTameratLaw,Home Improvement: Did Tim Taylor Have Asperger's Syndrome?,"I woke up this morning with a memory of the 1997 Home Improvement episode *The Karate Kid Returns* (S6E14). In the opening, Tim goes out back and meets the Beach Boys, who are staying with their cousin Wilson. The Beach Boys are generous enough to sing Tim a song and he's like ""well actually... maybe you could sing a car song??"". He names a bunch of car songs and it's funny because the ones he names aren't Beach Boys songs and eventually they end up singing Little Deuce Coup and Tim is happy, ""AHHHOOOG!"" grunt, more power, etc.

Here's the clip: [https://streamable.com/p51xt](https://streamable.com/p51xt)

And I was thinking this morning about how weird that interaction is. It supposes that Tim's choice in music isn't based on artist or genre, but on song subject. As long as the song is about cars, he's all in.

\[It would be like if someone who loved dogs met Paul McCartney, watched him play Eleanor Rigby, and reacted with ""ehhh, could you play Hey Bulldog instead?"" (This would be extra insulting to Sir Paul because Hey Bulldog was actually a John Lennon song. I was going to use Martha My Dear in this example but wasn't sure if everyone would know that that song is about Paul's dog.)\]

Tim's choice in music is tied to his one true interest: cars. He's able to list four car songs really quick (and presumably knows more, but chose those 4 songs because they were from The Beach Boys' era). This led me to thinking back on how obsessed Tim is with cars during the run of Home Improvement and how that obsession might be linked to having Asperger's Syndrome.

So I looked up [other signs of Asperger's](https://www.everydayhealth.com/aspergers/what-are-signs-symptoms-disorder/) and a lot of it really lines up with Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*- Problems making or maintaining friendships*

Tim basically has two friends, Al and Wilson. He constantly abuses Al and only talks about himself with Wilson.

&gt;\- *Isolation or minimal interaction in social situations*

Tim's life revolves around going from home to the Tool Time studio (and occasionally the hardware store where he can share his obsession). And when he is at home, he enjoys spending time isolated in his garage working on his hot rod.

&gt;*- Inappropriate behaviors or odd mannerisms*

The grunting.

&gt;*- Problems expressing empathy, controlling emotions, or communicating feelings*

I'm pretty sure every problem Tim ever had with his wife Jill was about just this (except for the problems that arose from not wanting to go to the opera, but that may tie to his isolation tendencies). 

&gt;*- Lack of common sense*

This clip summarizes that nicely: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ9Xk0Lln5Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ9Xk0Lln5Y)

&gt;*- Tendency to engage in one-sided conversations (about oneself)*

See all of his backyard conversations with Wilson.

&gt;*- Fascination with certain topics*

Cars, tools, more power, Mario Andretti.

&gt;*- The preference for a strict schedule or routine*

Here's the description for S6E2 of Home Improvement *Future Shock*: ""Tim is set in his morning routine and Jill wants him to be a bit more flexible."" Here's a clip: [https://streamable.com/jxbou](https://streamable.com/jxbou)

&amp;#x200B;

Could Tim's behavior explain why Jill was so intent on obtaining her Masters in Psychology throughout the series - to better understand her husband?

Anyways this was just a weird thought I had during a weird time. Thoughts??",74,1585079090,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fobobp/home_improvement_did_tim_taylor_have_aspergers/,television,1

fo9zph,pm_me_reason_to_livx,Vampires (Netflix) is a gloomy looking vamp-series that takes on more than it can handle.," Vampires is about..... well, Vampires. Titling doesn't get more straight-forward than that, but after watching this series you'd wish the plot was as simple and straight-forward as the title is. Centered around a teenage girl 'Doina' and her family's over decade long feud with.... what's suppose to be like a dynasty of the Vampire race or something? But anyways, Vampires is a teen-drama that's not really a teen-drama, and a family-drama that's not really a family-drama with almost all the tropes of the Vampire sub-genre shoehorned in. And no, this isn't because the series is an avant-garde or anything like that, it just can't seem to commit to being anything really. 

Visually Vampires is dark and bleak, almost resembling something filmed in Eastern-Europe, you know the way everything looks depressing and gloomy, which I think is a complementing for a Vampire series, even though that might've just been the producers making the best out of a low-budget situation. That pretty much the only positive thing I have to say about this series though, as it falls short in its attempts to tell a complex story. There is a core set-up that the series is built around, but instead of having one main plotline that's progressive through and through and easy to follow, the series opts for several different conflicts here and there, which are often times just there, without any development or aim to give a good payoff. Sure some shows do this and does it well, but Vampires just doesn't have the writing or structure to back it up. It lacks depth in its world building For eg. the vampire dynasty is so vaguely done you don't even see most of them enough to point out who's who, and when you do, they barely look threatening. 

To simply put it, as a series Vampires is all over the fucking place. There is no cohesion, and it tries to do too much instead of just presenting one main plotline as that is all the writing could handle. I bailed after 4 episodes because that's how little I trust this to give me resolution or good payoffs to the multiple conflicts that is being presented here.

This is biggest TV reddit on here so I thought why not create a general poll on the type of shows people like on here. 

I think options should be broad and this will be interesting to see whether types of shows people watch will fit into these options. To me there are 5 types tv shows type which are below.

To make this difficult you can only choose one you can’t choose drama &amp; comedy, you have to decided which one you like better. 

Let see how this goes and i don't think i need to give examples of each ?.

fo8zxs,pm_me_judge_reinhold,"In your opinion, who is the best TV dad and/or mom?","I suppose some of the following criteria should be used-

1. Security- The parents protect the children against dangers (in the form of peer pressure, personal mistakes, etc)

2. Availability- the parents are not always working or out of town 

3. Education- the parents impart wisdom or teach skills to their children in an effort to see growth 

4. Genuine interest/love for kids- This one would seem obvious but you do have shows where the parent(s) feel tied down by their family (Married with Children, According to Jim, etc.)

I'm sure there are more that will be used, but these were some basics I thought of. 

I think there's a case to be made that Alan Matthews of Boy Meets World is a top contender here.

fo8oy4,Dayofsloths,Picard hit a new low- spoilers,"I've been hate watching this show and criticizing it as it's obviously terrible, but it really jumped the shark in the last episode. Here's what happened:

In a previous episode, a blond woman who was acting as their doctor just straight up murdered her ex-boyfriend who Picard had been looking for since the first episode. She killed him because she had been shown a prophecy stating synthetic life would be responsible for ending organic life in the universe and was trying to stop that. When they discovered she did this and was leading assassins to them, their response was to immediately forgive her with zero consequences. Not only do they not hold her cold blooded murder against her, when Picard is unconscious, THEY LEAVE HIM WITH HER.

She literally fucking murdered the last person she was supposed to take care of and they just leave her with a completely defenseless old man. 

The implied reason for forgiveness seemed that they just kind of assumed she was brainwashed, but is better somehow, so she's just good to do whatever without any kind of supervision or consequences for her actions.


It honestly seems like the writers are just putting down words with no consideration at all for what happened in previous episodes. If they want a round peg in a square hole, they make the peg square and fuck you for thinking it used to be round.

There's so much wrong with the recent episode I could go on for ages, but letting the murdered play nurse to someone after they *just* murdered someone in identical circumstances is just too far. I'll watch the last episode because I'm a masochist, but I'm not watching the second season, I want off this sick ride.",23,1585069575,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fo8oy4/picard_hit_a_new_low_spoilers/,television,1

fo4few,SomeKrazyGuyUKno,Are the CW superhero shows meant to look cheesy like 'Power Rangers' stuff from the '90s?,"Title says it all, really.

During this quarantine I've caught up on a lot of stuff on Netflix, and given the long stretches of time I've been home I've spent it catching up on shows with like 22-episode seasons. I've finally caught up to *Supernatural*, I've begun *Riverdale* (on Season 2), and Netflix reminded me I haven't watched *Arrow* or any of it's affiliated shows in a while. From what I can figure, like 6 years because I dipped out in 2014 during Season Three of *Arrow* and Season One of *The Flash*.

So out of curiosity, I looked up some clips from the crossover events they've been doing and I'm just **shocked** by the brazen shamelessness they have by putting these CGI effects on air. It might be wrong to even call it CGI, that's like borderline clip-art. That's some early PS2 effects they've got going on here.

I'm just gonna leave a clip I watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuBovqUQs8A).

There's got to be a better way, people! What gets me especially is that this dude is killed off *off-screen* and he's essentially the flagship character for the franchise. We don't even see his final fight. From a storytelling perspective-- as well as a practical one-- this is just embarrassing.",33,1585053539,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fo4few/are_the_cw_superhero_shows_meant_to_look_cheesy/,television,1

I never got why Demi Moore would have married him. I've only knew the actor as a bald, dumpy lug-head from action films and poorly conceived comedy films, but watching him play a charming and fun character makes it finally click into place. 

The guy was dashing and quippy on Moonlighting, and I think that public memories of this period of his actorly life may have helped carry him through his 90s career which, aside from Die Hard and later on Pulp Fiction, was mixed. I like 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, The Jackal, and the 6th Sense, but he was hardly a sexy dude in those films. 

But Now that I understand that most viewers first met him by watching Moonlighting I understand that generations of TV fans knew him as delightful, handsome, and raffishly appealing actor before his ""I'll kill you and fuck your girlfriend"" phase. The show is worth watching, and it seems as though all of it is available in good quality on YouTube.",109,1585038519,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fo1l5p/ive_started_watching_moonlighting_19851989_on/,television,1
fo1ft7,Pyrnne,Henry Cavill kinda sucked as Geralt,"His voice, mannerisms and microexpressions throughout the series felt painfully forced, it was actually frustrating to watch. It felt like he was trying too hard to sound like Doug Cockle rather than coming off in any way natural. Cavill has never been the best actor around, and you don't have to be, but it was hindering his lines and ruined a lot of his scenes between other characters. I honestly wonder if the actors on set thought he sounded ridiculous whenever the cameras stopped rolling, and he started talking normally again.

In general it felt like he was forcing this ""I'm a badass"" act in every bloody scene, I just wanted him to come off it already. As a sidenote, I think many fans of his portrayal are way too obsessed with Cavill himself due to the ""I'm a gamer"" image that him and his publicist keep preaching to the press, and as a result get so worked up over any criticism towards him or the series. I'd like to think this is a neutral subreddit when it comes to opinions on the show and Cavill, so I was wondering what everyone else thought about his portrayal.",10,1585037666,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fo1ft7/henry_cavill_kinda_sucked_as_geralt/,television,1

I'm confused over DVDtalk's review of this season claiming the actors and the jokes are tired in this one. I feel the exact opposite. Not Quite South Of The Border has to be among the most fun episodes for them to make, and one of my favorites of the whole show. The whole thing is one crazy disaster from start to finish, spiraling out of control more and more.

That's a common element with most of the best ones in here, such as Murder On The Moosejaw Express, The Diner, You Oughta Be In Pictures and You've Pushed Me Too Far. They amp up the craziness so much that you wait in anticipation over what's gonna happen next.

It also has some of the most emotional and heartfelt episodes. The Wedding is the most adorable half hour I've seen in quite a while, and needless to say I don't think I'm alone to tearing up over Penny Marshall's amazing performance in Why Did The Fireman...

Even initially lighthearted episodes like Testing, Testing and The Duke Of Squigman are not afraid to go serious and hit you with revelations about the characters. They touch on Lenny's childhood and address the deeply-rooted insecurities Squiggy bottles up underneath all the confidence.

What Do You With A Drunken Sailor? is the only one I have problems with since it's way too similiar to Buddy Can You Spare A Father, but even that one is still good fun. Laverne and Shirley's circus-like antics when they are at the bar is a highlight.

One wants to quit but doesn’t want to self evict because it would look bad and she wouldn’t get paid so she’s now holding everyone’s votes hostage in order to force them to vote her out. 

Multiple producers have resigned due to fears of the virus because BBCan is still going on even though Ontario was put on a stay at home ban. 

There’s technically only been 1 vote this season and we’re almost at the jury phase already and half the house is gone.

fnuibr,pm_me_reason_to_livx,"The Letter for the King (Netflix) is a good enough children's fantasy drama, but is missing that magic that would've made it something great.","Well first of all I wasn't even planning on watching The Letter for the King after seeing that very unconvincing trailer, but the night before I pretty much stayed up all night doing some aggressive masturbating and was too sleepy the next morning to read subtitles, so instead of something in a language I can't understand (which was the plan), I decided to give it a try. It surprised me in the sense that it's not as bad as I expected, but it's still a very average series, one that I have a hard time deciding whether or not it was worth the watch. 

Based on what was originally a Dutch book (of the same name), The Letter for the King is a medieval fantasy drama about a young aspiring knight Tiuri who finds himself on a perilous mission to.... well, *deliver a secret message to the king*. The series is quite adventurous as our characters jumps from small village to small village with each episode, but this also means plot-wise the episodes can get quite repetitive as Tiuri's enemies always being a step behind him and them having an encounter at the end of most episodes where he and his female companion Lavinia narrowly escapes, is a scenario the writers rely on a bit too often. 

Production-wise The Letter for the King isn't all bad. The green-screen can be quite obvious at times, but still you can see Netflix spent a decent amount of money on this, especially for something being marketed for children, as that is usually an excuse for networks not to. The story is there, it is compelling in a way it barely matter by what means they tell it, but whether or not you enjoy it will depend on how engaging you find it without there being any high-level production involved. The series feels like it's missing that oomph, that spark, or to be on-topic, that magic that would've made it into something great though, or maybe it's because every essential aspect was done so averagely, from the very wannabe-smart dialogue to the iffy acting from the young cast. The dynamic between Tiuri and Lavinia is what kept me going, so there are some positives here, but overall it's an average series to say the least, one that I can't be too hard on because it's a children's series good enough for adults to find enjoyable.

fns809,James__K__Polk,"Due to working from home, I've watched more episodes of Cops in the past ten days than I have in my entire life. Here are 20 observations.","1. 75% of drug-related arrests happen because they get pulled over for a minor traffic violation.



2. For some reason, having drugs in your glovebox prevents you from wearing a seatbelt. 


3. Man, all those people are poor. 


4. People only feel bad for running from the cops after they get caught. 


5. Even the cop chasing you weighs 70 pounds more than you, you will trip over something, allowing you get gang tackled. 


6. Women with facial piercings are 90% more likely to experience domestic violence. 



7. Guys in tank tops are 90% more likely to commit domestic violence. 


8. Cops are on a first name basis with neigborhood repeat offenders like bartenders know all their regulars. 

4. There's nothing more suspicious than a dude in a parked car. Everyone who's ever sat in a parked car has either drugs, weapons, or warrants. 


4. So many people don't know their rights.

5. People don't realize that fleeing is often a bigger charge than the 0.7 grams of heroin in their glovebox. 


8. Pretty much every cop has an older relative who is a cop. 


9. Every stolen car was ""borrowed"" from a friend. 


14. Tasers are either the most effective non-lethal device on the planet, or useless pieces of crap that couldn't shock a puddle of water.


9. A whole lot of people do meth. 



10. 98% of women who get arrested cry during the arrest.  

11. If you get caught with drugs, you will get a lecture on how drugs ruin your life. The irony that part of the reason why their life is being ruined is beacuse they're about to go to prison is lost upon many cops. 


6. The excuses cops hear are ridiculous. Everyone who's ever been arrested for having drugs in their jacket pocket will say ""this isn't my jacket. I found it.""


9. About once every couple months, police officers will experience something so ridiculous that it's good thing the cameras were there to capture it.

fnms04,adiman93,Which past tv show do you see make one off movie / special / miniseries in the future,"Due to corona virus outbreak , there was been lock down and quarantine in many areas of the world. Many of us use this quarantine to watch some of our favorite tv shows or watch new tv shows. These are some of the  past tv shows I feel could make future installments 

**Community** : Netflix has already purchased Community for its streaming platforms. The fan base for the comedy is vocal and a movie will be made in the future. Whether Netflix is financing the movie or the movie is financed by the studio . The 6 seasons and movie meme will soon be a reality

**Chuck** : Another tv show which has a very vocal fanbase was Chuck. Zachary Levi wants to do a Chuck movie did his performance was well received both critically and financially in Shazam and if the sequel of Shazam is a success , then Levi would be in a great position to ask Warner Bros to green light a Chuck movie

**The Office:** The show is consistently one of the most watched shows on streaming platforms. I could see Netflix throw a significant amount of cash to the creator of The Office to do a one of special like Friends or a movie in the futur",0,1584980671,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fnms04/which_past_tv_show_do_you_see_make_one_off_movie/,television,1

Right?

Sure, we all want to continue being entertained by Netflix, HBO, TNT, etc. But entertainment is not an excuse to risk the spread of the coronavirus. Right?

Not going to try and ""sell"" you on the show, because I couldn't do it justice (and don't want to spoil it), but the basic story follows a team of corrupt cops in the rougher parts of LA. I know that sounds a hundred other cop shows but it's so much more than that. The first episode gives you a good idea of what sort of show it is

Again and again, this show reach a peak of brilliance, and somehow managed to surpass it. It told an honest, visceral portrait of a life so fully lived. And it told it without filter or compromise, without succumbing to dramatic cliches or fan-service. It was as tragic as it gets without being cynical and silly as it gets without being cheap.

fne4nc,JoshPhilpie,"Finished Sons of Anarchy earlier today for the first time, got some thoughts","Wow what a ride this show was, after watching The Shield last year I was definitely pumped to see this show(especially the Shield episodes written by Sutter were some of my faves)and it didn't dissapoint.  I know some people think this show went downhill after season 2 and never recovered but I don't feel that way, I genuinely liked season 3 even if it is my least favorite in the series.  I found the trip to Ireland interesting and I liked that it was more character driven then the previous two seasons.  Also I know some people didn't like the big twist at the end of season 4 but I thought it was pretty clever(it was foreshadowed at least)I also didn't mind Jax getting darker and more ruthless in seasons 6 and 7, felt perfectly in character for him to get to that point.

Also I have to say this has easily the best soundtrack of any TV show i've ever seen, I like the rock songs used in the show and I genuinely like Katey Sagal's singing and I don't mind the music montages either(I especially loved the ones set to ""You Are My Sunshine"", Ed Sheeran's ""Let It Rain"" and ""Mary"" the last one was a real tearjerker in particular).

I also know some had mixed feelings about the finale but I felt like it ended perfectly, I couldn't see any other way it could've possibly ended(though I would not have minded a few extra minutes spent with the rest of SAMCRO).",38,1584938746,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fne4nc/finished_sons_of_anarchy_earlier_today_for_the/,television,1

to know that a common pet form of a name such as Susie Q contains the 17th letter of the alphabet (Q) as a common extension of it really makes me wonder how awesomely rad wordplay can become if you discover that somebody's birthday, in terms of number of days after New Years Eve, is the square of a letter of the alphabet that extends a pet form of a common name.

fnc1dv,nevereatpears,Lil Dicky's new show Dave is really funny,"It feels like if Atlanta met Curb Your Enthusiasm.

I realise the above is exceptionally high praise - but allow me to elaborate.

The show is about Dave, known as rapper Lil Dicky, as he attempts to break away from the 'youtube rapper' image and be taken more seriously in the business. A lot of the comedy comes from him being an unassuming mild mannered middle class Jewish man. It's really self deprecating.

Firstly, for his first sitcom, the show is extremely polished and laughs are regular. It's a fresh show but it doesn't feel slap dash. This could be explained by the team LD has behind him - Seinfeld's Jeff Schaffer co-writing and Superbad directer Greg Mottalo, he's got some big seasoned guns behind him.

The acting feels natural. LD is very good - his subtle acting style bounces off the more comedic characters well. 

Gata, another broke rapper in the industry, reminds me of Leon Black from Curb Your Enthusiasm - he comes out with the same ridiculous type of lines and the two have a really strong dynamic that plays well. 

For example, they're talking about shampoo at the beginning of the second episode...

Gata says: ""You crazy bro, I used to just wash my hair with a bar of soap. Like a barbarian, that shit used to get my hair straight - like real clean.""

Dicky: ""A bar of soap on the head?""

Gata: ""Come on, a bar of soap is smarter than a tic tac bro - that shit was clean bro""

To me exchanges like that feel very Leon. Now, before angry Curb fans downvote - I'm not saying Dave is at Curb level yet. But for the first couple episodes, it's a promising new sitcom.

LD's girlfriend is also very good. Taylor Misiak gives a good performance.

I think a lot of the natural performances are down to Mottalo's direction.

This also feels like Atlanta because it is about a small time rapper. It's the sort of show that people were expecting Donald Glover to come out with before the series went in a very different direction, because him and LD are both sort of nerdy satirical rappers. So it's nice to finally have a show about a rapper trying to get in to the game. It's a fun watch. Now I love Atlanta - but this show is definitely filling a vacant hole that hasn't been explored yet.

Has anyone else been enjoying? I feel like it's still kind of low key on Reddit. I hope the ratings are good for it.

P.S 

Let's get past the whole Chris Brown controversy against LD - yah what he did, making a track with CB, was wrong imo - but I don't believe that should ruin his career. He's made a cracking sitcom and in the past his comedy raps have been top tier.

Edit: I just realised, Gator calls Lil Dicky 'LD' just like Leon calls Larry in Curb!",9,1584929307,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fnc1dv/lil_dickys_new_show_dave_is_really_funny/,television,1

fnbyb2,tangre79,I Dream Of Jeannie: Jeannie is the worst and Dr. Bellows is the real victim.,"I've started watching the hit sitcom from the 1960's I Dream of Jeannie starring Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman. I don't believe this is what they were going for in producing the show, but I've concluded that Jeannie is the worst, and Dr. Bellows is the real victim in everything that happens.

Let's consider the facts. What does Jeannie consistently do in every episode? She takes something that Tony says literally, and creates yet another mess which she places him ever so gingerly into the center of. Even if she's not taking something he says literally, she loves to meddle in his life. Everywhere from interfering in his relationships, which always lands him in an awkward position every time, and interfering with his work, yet again landing him in not only awkward but dangerous positions. She consistently defies Tony, and creates messes that they only narrowly escape from. He's had ample opportunity to get rid of her, yet he insists on allowing her to stay around and complicate his life.

Then there's Tony. Honestly, he's not much better. For an astronaut, he's not only a pretty slow learner, but he's not that bright either. He's meant to be seen as the voice of reason but I just don't see him as such. He doesn't learn how to watch his wording, and often even escalates dangerous situations. A fine example is when, once again due to Jeannie taking something Tony says literally, gets blinked to the times of Napoleon. Now Tony, having narrowly escaped several catastrophes before, could have just asked Jeannie to send him back to the present, but does he? Nope. He insists on meeting Napoleon personally, and *telling him about what he's going to do.* We all know how screwing with timelines can end. Not to mention in this episode, of course, everybody thought Tony was nuts and took him to be beheaded. What does Tony say as he's being placed on the guillotine? ""You're making a big mistake buddy! I'm on detached duty to NASA!"" Doesn't take a genius to know that NASA didn't exist for over 100 years after Napoleon's death. Another example is Tony wished he could meet King Kamehameha. Of course, Jeannie brings him to the present. This once again could have been solved by simply sending him back, but Tony insists on showing the King the progress that Hawaii has made since his time, which of course results in disaster. While the root of Tony's problems is Jeannie, Tony brings a lot of what happens to him onto himself.

Although I don't think it's meant to look this way, realistically, Roger is the voice of reason. When he's not blinded by his own greed, that is. Not much of a voice of reason, but still a devoted friend. He often gets roped into the situations not only created by Jeannie but escalated by Tony. Roger has had ample opportunity to walk away from Tony's problems, but always stuck around, even in one case flying to the Middle East on his own dime to rescue Tony the same day. Things that Jeannie does have also effected Roger in massively negative ways. Roger does often manage to be the saving grace in many of the situations.

Dr. Bellows is so often painted as the villain, seeking to discover and out Jeannie to the world, but I truly see him as the true victim of everything that happens. I feel far more for him and how he comes out of each situation than I do for Tony or anybody else. Jeannie's antics tend to see the least disguise when he's around, causing him to start to question his sanity, and he is often at the expense of every situation that she creates. Every time he thinks he's finally got Tony in his antics (caused by Jeannie) cornered, he goes to fetch General Peterson only to find everything he'd witnessed is gone, leading General Peterson to have Dr. Bellows evaluated. Dr. Bellows has every right to be concerned being his career is in psychology and Tony is one of the people he's required to oversee, and ends up being the victim of Jeannie's troublemaking. 

This all being said, I love the show. I think it's a lot of fun otherwise, and I absolutely love the set designs for when Jeannie is in small form, and I love the special effects which are fantastic for the time. In a real life situation, I'd have gotten rid of her as fast as I can, but I'm glad Tony didn't because that wouldn't make for nearly as entertaining of a show. This is just my take on the show.

fn9ws6,tangre79,"Fans of the original Dynasty soap opera: I'm making a good/evil alignment chart, who could possibly be neutral evil?","I've been trying to make a good/evil alignment chart for the soap opera Dynasty from the 1980's (NOT the remake). An example of what I'm talking about is this:

https://i.redd.it/yl9u6fan1rkz.png

I've got most of it worked out. The way I see it, lawful good is Krystle. She has never and would never sell out to benefit herself, and would never act against her morals. I'm trying to work with as many top billed characters as possible. Obviously I won't be able to have every top billed character, but I'm trying to go with the most significant.

Neutral good would be Blake. He's done some bad things in the name of good before, and done some things that are flat out bad too. At the end of the day though, his alignment is to good.

Chaotic good is either Sable or Caress. Either or, because they have shown to be on the good side while being very devious and scheming against the bad side. Both were willing to exploit and blackmail in order to make those schemes happen, and are emotionally driven.

Neutral good would be Fallon or Steven. Both have shown to be loyal to both sides, and have rarely fought against the other side. If they did, it was for personal reasons or moral reasons.

True neutral would be Dex. Dex has fought against both sides, and worked along side with and been very close to both sides. His alignment has bounced back and forth frequently.

Neutral evil would be Adam. Adam has been loyal to both sides, but has also dealt some very low blows to both sides. Stooping to lows that Dex never would, bordering on the verge of illegal.

Lawful evil would have been Cecil. By the time of his death, he loathed Blake, someone he considered his friend. Although he never acted on it, he was clear in his hate in his dying moments. 

Chaotic evil would be Alexis. Emotionally driven, and willing to stoop to all time lows by using exploitation, blackmail, threats, and whatever else she needed to do to attack the good side.

This begs the question, who would apply as a neutral evil? It seems a though nearly everyone else who schemed against the side of good was virtually beneath contempt, and would fit far better in with chaotic evil.

It's a fantastic show!  This is a high-quality show and I'm surprised it only lasted for a few seasons. I'm currently watching on Hulo, but they don't' have every episode.

fn2jau,OVEIDPTVZSEU,"'Herrens veje': Adam Price's follow-up to 'Borgen' is on Netflix in the U.S., and it's quite good","Price is a Danish screenwriter. He created and wrote *Borgen*, a 2010-2013 political drama in the vein of *The West Wing* about the first female prime minister of Denmark. It has a bit of a cult following, at least in the U.S. where it's been hard to find. It's a good show even if it portrays the politics of a different era already.

*Herrens veje*, or *Ride Upon the Storm* (Netflix is using its Danish title), is a family drama. As [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80202183) describes it: ""A family with a storied history of service to the Church of Denmark fractures under the tyrannical rule and ambition of its hard-driving patriarch."" Lars Mikkelsen stars as that patriarch, and won an international Emmy for the role.

I've been looking for this show to appear in the U.S. for 3 years, and all of a sudden I found it scrolling Netflix (I wonder it has something to do with Price doing *Ragnarok* for Netflix). Anyway, I'm enjoying it so far! I love a grounded ensemble drama.

So if you liked *Borgen*, or if you're interested in an adult family drama set in a foreign land (assuming you're not from Denmark), or want to watch a rare show that actually grapples with faith, check this out.",6,1584895189,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fn2jau/herrens_veje_adam_prices_followup_to_borgen_is_on/,television,1

fmyn5m,depressedDemogorgon,"Am I the only one to ""like"" seeing characters abused?","Don't get me wrong. I don't get any sense of pleasure by SEEING a character from a TV show/movie abused, I do not rejoice at that. 

However, I am truly fascinated by how a character behaves after an abuse of some kind, because it shows a different and almost always concealed side of their personality. It's not always good, obviously, but many times it shows that even the gentlest soul has a dark side or, on the contrary, even the thoughest person can be terribly weak.

Moreover, I love feeling empathic towards characters I'm interested in.

**! DOWNTON ABBEY  SEASON 4 EPISODE 3 SPOILER AHEAD!**

Take for instance Anna after being raped. One one hand, my heart cried at the sight of her in Mrs. Hughes' office, pleading the woman to keep her secret. One the other hand, I loved seeing the afterwards, how her personality had changed, how she behaved.

I love a good heated blowup fight from best friends because it's always nice to see how they can go from best friends, to mortal enemies to best friends again. Shows growth which is realistic like real life. The best fight I can remember between two friends is from One Tree Hill in Season 3 with Sophia Bush and Hiliarie Burton. The passion from Sophia Bush was amazing. She can act her pants off. I felt every word she said, from her pain, anger and etc. It was a classic rivalry. Best friends in S1, fell off due to them liking the same boy, got cool again in S2 and were friends all the way til S3 finale and then all of S4 they were fighting, then they finally make peace and move on. 

Lol you can tell I'm bored sitting at home. I also just wanna use this as a reference to check out new shows I may not have seen before.",5,1584854014,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fmujsx/whats_your_favorite_teenyoung_adult_drama_blowups/,television,1
fmuffo,orangemo8,"I know I talk about cartoons and TV shows too much, especially Family Guy, but what are your thoughts on Bless the Harts and Duncanville (the two new Fox cartoons this season)? I’d love to hear what you think. Thanks for chatting with me!","Bob’s Burgers is still my favorite, but Fox ordered two new animated sitcoms this season Bless the Harts and Duncanville. Thoughts? I know I talk about cartoons way too much, but I actually like them both. They do have potential and I hope they stick around at least for a few seasons if not more.  I’d much rather watch these than Simpsons and Family Guy, even American Dad (I still love them all they’re just not the same anymore). I think these new shows are great since we really need something new on the block.

Just keep in mind freshman comedies take time to get good. Usually the case with Fox animated shows is that they get better after the first season (Bob’s Burgers).

I can definitely tell there’s a lot more effort in these than Bordertown and Allen Gregory (the only 1 season Fox cartoon shows I saw). I didn’t really hate them but they were mediocre shows though they probably could have benefitted from a second season.

So what are your thoughts? I’d so love to hear from you all! Thanks for chatting with me!",16,1584853425,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fmuffo/i_know_i_talk_about_cartoons_and_tv_shows_too/,television,1

fmf2d9,SubaruToyotaFan1986,ELI5: How are repeat rights sorted out for episode reruns?,"I know that, at least during the late 2000s and early 2010s, here in the United Kingdom, ITV4 did not show certain episodes of shows claiming they did not have the rights to rerun certain episodes.

With COVID-19, I expect re-runs to be a large part of British schedules, since shows with live audiences etc. are cancelled for obvious reasons.

This isn't so much about British television, just the concept in general, as I've sometimes rewatched series I used to enjoy and the episodes are occasionally done in blocks with some missing - I think *Only Fools and Horses*, *The Bill*, *Holby City* *(*was good to watch some of the older ones*)* and reality TV/documentary show *Police Camera Action* seem affected by this.

For example, with *Friends*, are certain episodes omitted when stations buy the rights? I believe Netflix had edited versions of the episode, sort of an analog to ""television cut"" of movies.

I've looked into this at a basic level from Google searching, but ""repeat rights"" had the Wikipedia article for rerun etc. so I wasn't sure what to look up on this.

And they just felt right for each other and omg I could go into so much more detail about why Skate is the better couple

fmb9u5,keyishumanity,Netflix's Locke &amp; Key Characters are stupid,"I just finished watching Locke and Key and honestly I became more and more frustrated every episode.

They are fighting a supposed demon but do not use any logic and make the worst decisions. 

They know the keys cannot be stolen from only the locke family but they still entrust it to others. For example when they gave ellie the key for the crown.

&amp;#x200B;

When they saw the demon at any point they could have used the key which controls other people but they didnt use it.

They saw the demon passed out in the end and still casually assume well the crowns gone. They don't search her for the keys or anything. They could have put her in the mirror dimension but still chose to unlock the omega door which holds demons. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kinsey is the most annoying character. Everything she does is so stupid. She uses the control key to act out revenge but then doesn't think to use it against the demon trying to kill her family.  Eventhough she removed fear from her head that doesn't have anything to do with intelligence.  Also she removed fear from head which is going around attacking people. She doesnt even think to put it back in her head because it can kill other people. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly the whole show is so frustratingly and stupidly made. I read from others the comics it's based upon are good but they really ruined the adaptation.

Stations were trash, the ‘family’ station just played the same rerun episode of antfarm. Anyways, there was one show that I kind of enjoyed that was on a station i didnt have much interest in. The show was some kind of a crime show or something. I forgot what the show was called but from what I can remember about it either the show’s intro or outro song was Intro - The xx. I can sort of remember one of the episodes where the main character was trying to extract someone out of a very dangerous and sketchy area (I remember there being large apartment buildings skattered across. I believe they were being hunted by some gang of some sort. I also remember looking it up a year or 2 ago and seeing that it was a relatively short-runned show.

fm5s38,pm_me_reason_to_livx,At this point should we consider series like Feel Good (Channel 4) generic?," Whether it's the critically acclaimed Louie, or HBO's Crashing, or the mostly unknown Unge Lovende, or Netflix' list of series like Lovesick, Love, Flaked etc. which are almost indistinguishable, I'm pretty sure we're all familiar with these types of comedies. Usually LA or New York-based, usually centered around doomed romances, usually with main characters who have a dark past or somber backstory, usually features AA/NA meeting which are often just time-fillers and never seems to work for whatever reason, and usually featuring stand-up comedy performances, these shows can tell different stories but they all feel the same because of the overdone style, method and tropes they use to tell them (with the exception of Louie?). 

In comes Channel 4 and Netflix's new dramedy 'Feel Good', which at first impression seems to just be ticking all the boxes of a generic US mumblecore rom-com. A main character who's a real life comedian but a struggling comedian in the series and uses their real name in the series? *check!* Centered around a seemingly doomed to fail relationship because both parties are so caught up in the issues they have with their partner they gloss over the issues their partner have with them? *check!* Features a group of pretentious or obnoxious side characters? *check!* Features tedious AA/NA meetings? *check!* In fact, until it is mentioned you probably wouldn't even realize Feel Good is a UK series (if you're watching it internationally on Netflix of course). 

But with all of that said, I do have to admit Feel Good is actually pretty decent... well, if you have the patience for such an unexciting character/relationship driven dramedy. It may be generic and ordinary but this series does have its moments. There are funny moments, heart-felt moments, heart-breaking moments etc. and it doesn't even require your full 100% attention. The chemistry between our 2 leads is surprisingly good, not bursting out the screen or anything but still pretty good. The writing is also pretty good even when the premise of the whole thing is kinda basic. In fact I wouldn't be against recommending Feel Good, but it is far from being essential viewing.

Well... Yeah, I  don't know. I have no recommendations for you.

But, what I *do* have are shows *not* to watch while stuck under quarantine. 
And these include 

     • Chernobyl 
     •  Dark
     • Black Mirror
     • The Expanse 
     • Twilight Zone (the original)

These shows and others like them will definitely send you spiraling into a dark  existential crisis that there is currently *no* hope of emerging from.

If you *must* watch said shows then please, have some light hearted comedy at the ready to lift the mood, funny subreddits, quirky YouTube videos. And if none of that helps, then a solid dose of The Office should do the trick.

fluw6m,Crane_Train,Last Man On Earth - An appropriate show to binge during quarantine,"I've been thinking of things to watch during this quarantine time and I realized one of the most appropriate things to re-watch would be The Last Man on Earth starring Will Forte &amp; Kristen Schaal.  It was on Fox for 4 seasons until cancelled.  The show first aired in 2015, and it's about a terrible virus that kills almost everyone on Earth around the year 2020.  Does this ring any bells for anyone?  

Will Forte &amp; Kristen Schaal are great throughout.  The supporting cast is OK.  I can honestly say that I've never seen a funnier pilot for a show.  It's great.  The quality of the writing starts incredibly high, and then as the first season progresses, it starts getting a bit stale.  However, in the 2nd and subsequent seasons, they seem to find their stride and it becomes better.  I highly recommend it.",58,1584710381,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fluw6m/last_man_on_earth_an_appropriate_show_to_binge/,television,1

fltjdl,ouroboros_benzene,The resemblance of the current world scenario with Game of Thrones is quite uncanny,"For some time now, there have been people who have been warning us that “it  is not a matter of if, but when” the next pandemic will strike.  “We all have to  be prepared”, they kept saying “Winter is coming”.  

But the enemy was imaginary for all of us, beyond the “wall” of  reality.  
So we decided to focus on more pressing issues. Who should be the Prime  Minister/President (who sits on the throne), Us vs Them &amp; don't cross my  borders (wildlings). My religion is the best (The Seven gods or the lord of the  light).  
Then one day, in a faraway place called Wuhan, the enemy riding on a dragon  (well, probably a bat) shatters the “Wall” and crosses the line from the  imaginary to the reality.   
People start dropping dead all around. 

""But that is Eastwatch, let them deal  with it. We are safe in our kingdoms,"" we thought.  There were some who did not  even believe that the threat was real.   
In past few days, things have changed.  But now, the enemy marches forward,  and everything it touches, it makes its own.  “*We*” became its army and the army  keeps on increasing.   
This is an all hands on deck kind of a situation now (not literally though,  keep your hands washed and away from the deck). There are differences among us  but they can be settled later once this enemy is defeated.  The fate of the most  vulnerable people in the world depends on the fact that we — at least for some  time —  keep our differences aside and fight this menace. Till the time an Arya  among us figures out a way to stab (vaccine) and end it.

&gt;  
&gt;The **369th Infantry Regiment**, formerly known as the **15th New York National Guard Regiment** and commonly referred to as the **Harlem Hellfighters**, was an [infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry) [regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment) of the [New York Army National Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Army_National_Guard) during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II). The Regiment consisted mainly of [African Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans), though it also included several [Puerto Rican Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Ricans) during World War II. With the [370th Infantry Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/370th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)),[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)#cite_note-2) it was known for being one of the first African American regiments to serve with the [American Expeditionary Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Expeditionary_Forces) during World War I. Before the 15th NG Regiment was formed, any African American who wanted to fight in the war had to enlist in the [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Army) or [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Army) armies.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGero200944-3)

flszr1,CaptainRyuk,Does anyone love the TV Medium simply because of how easy it is to consume while exercising?,"Not only is it the perfect thing to do while also exercising (so that those of you who hate exercising also feel like you are not wasting time while doing so)........... But unlike music you actually make progress in something. Unlike Audio book, its much easier to focus watching something while doing extreme physical movements. Unlike movies which assumes you need almost 2 hours to finish in a complete run, you can simply stop at the end of an episode by the time a workout ends without feeling the impulse to finish the rest of the story  after you leave the gym.

The absolute best part? You can use episodes to measure how long your workout is. No need to see the watch or use a timer. Just count how many episodes you finished after spending beyond 20 minutes on the workout as a count to how long you been at it and to see if you matched your minimal daily benchmark.So if you intend to jog 4 miles an hour, simply watch 4 episodes of Seinfeld while talking on a primitive treadmill that doesn't use electricity. Intend to bike more than an hour? Watch 2 episodes of Spartacus.

Even more awesome is now that technology has advanced that you can bring a laptop to watch and your cellphone can even play entire episodes (esp with Netflix's recent function of downloading episodes as easy as drinking Pepsi added to its app for phone and tablet) it is easier than ever to keep up with shows. No need to bring a DVD to the gym to resume The Office, just download it into your netflix app on your phone before going to the gym!

Unlike say gaming and reading which requires you use your hands to control your character or turn to the next page, TV keeps you hand free so can basically do extreme stuff like dips while doing an olympic lif tor shadow box at very fast speed for hours while watching at the TV during a Breaking Bad marathon.

Even hiking out in the park or walking to the store, you can watch something along the way to kill the 20 min walking warmup.

What do you think? I now watch TV more than any other hobby (and its telling because I was a hardcore gamer) esp as I started to exercise more and more to reach back to my college years of being an athlete for eh uni's team. Simply I cannot think of another activity you can casually do while jump roping!

Anyone else started watching TV more and more because they also increased their exercise schedule up by 11?",5,1584701248,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/flszr1/does_anyone_love_the_tv_medium_simply_because_of/,television,1

I know it’s still early but I’m finding that all of the characters, or at least the main characters are just okay as people but I don’t necessarily like them and that I can’t identify with them. All the reviews I read and every time I hear of the show people talk about how likable and relatable the characters are. Am I supposed to identify with or relate to the characters? 

It’s odd because I find that the story is pretty unique and interesting and the acting is fine (Frances Conroy, the mom, is great and believable and probably my favorite) but at the same time I can’t really identify with the characters.

When a show that includes a baby is being cast, what factors do the casting directors consider when selecting the young star? 

The following are subjective opinions, but I consider the producers of Full House to have been incredibly fortunate that the two babies who played Michelle grew into the very popular and beautiful Olsen twins. Modern Family also introduced Lily as a baby, and now she's a middle schooler who looks great and has stellar comedic chops. I contrast this with the show Blossom in which the main character, while an adorable child in early seasons and always a skilled performer, aged into an awkward looking teen phase.

In such cases is the casting process a complete gamble, or do they look at family photos of applicants in order to develop an educated guess as to how the child might age? Are there notable examples of such casting decisions that turned out poorly?",21,1584659236,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fljw1r/how_do_casting_directors_and_producers_select/,television,1

fleo8u,ix0WXOeip4V6,"'All American,' One of Broadcast’s Least-Watched Shows, Is Now No. 1 on Netflix","An ever-fascinating dynamic, via [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/all-american-one-of-broadcasts-least-watched-shows-is-now-no-1-on-netflix/) ($):

&gt;During its two seasons, The CW’s drama All American has barely made a dent in the linear ratings, and is in fact one of broadcast’s least-watched primetime shows.  
&gt;  
&gt;But on Netflix, it’s a completely different story. After Season 2 was added to the streaming service on Tuesday, it shot to the top of Netflix’s most popular shows in the U.S., and has occupied the No. 1 spot among all Netflix movies and TV shows for the past two days.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the most recent example of what The CW network president Mark Pedowitz has called the “Netflix bump,” as his younger-skewing network’s shows like Riverdale find a large audience on Netflix that did not watch the series on linear. The network then tries to entice those new Netflix fans back to The CW to watch or stream the next season’s episodes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Season 2 of All American, which follows high school quarterback Spencer James (played by Daniel Ezra), was tied for 201st among all primetime broadcast shows this season in the adults 18-49 demo, with a 0.4 rating, according to Nielsen’s most current metrics. It averaged 1.1 million total viewers, which is tied for 227th this season among all primetime broadcast shows.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it’s been No. 1 on Netflix since Season 2 moved to the platform on March 27. Netflix doesn’t share total viewership figures, but its Top 10 list, [released in February](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-adds-top-10-feature-to-list-its-most-popular-shows-and-movies-each-day/), gives some insight as to the shows and movies that are doing particularly well among the service’s more than 61 million U.S. households.  
&gt;  
&gt;The CW was uniquely positioned to benefit from a “Netflix bump” given that under a previous deal with the streaming service, the full season of every series on the network moved to Netflix just eight days after airing its season finale on The CW. That gave Netflix viewers several months to stream episodes, as opposed to many SVOD deals, in which full seasons do not become available on a streaming service until 30 days before the next season is set to return on its linear network.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the second time that All American has benefited from the “Netflix bump,” since it also helped the low-rated series secure a Season 2 renewal last year. At the Television Critics Association’s press tour last summer, Pedowitz said the show enjoyed a Riverdale-like surge in popularity upon its availability on Netflix. While the [network “believed” in All American](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/the-cw-sets-new-digital-strategy-as-netflix-deal-lapses/) despite its meager ratings on linear, its [“phenomenal”](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/) success on Netflix was part of the thinking behind bringing the show back for a sophomore season.  
&gt;  
&gt;(The CW has already renewed All American for Season 3, as part of a move in January to [pick up almost its entire current slate for next season](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/the-cw-renews-13-shows-including-batwoman-riverdale-and-the-flash/).)  
&gt;  
&gt;All American and Riverdale aren’t the only shows to make a bigger splash on Netflix than on linear. You, which barely made a peep when Season 1 debuted on Lifetime in fall 2018, saw a huge surge of viewers when it moved to Netflix: [40 million households watched](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-now-has-139-million-subscribers-and-says-it-competes-with-fortnite-more-than-hbo/) at least 70% of a Season 1 episode in You’s first four weeks on the service, according to Netflix.  
&gt;  
&gt;While The CW has also seen a “Netflix bump” from shows like In the Dark, the network can no longer rely on that to boost for its new shows, following [a digital strategy shift last year when its Netflix deal lapsed](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/). While previously-running shows will continue to migrate to Netflix, The CW’s new series—including Batwoman, Nancy Drew and Katy Keene—will move to new digital homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The network has secured in-season streaming rights on its digital platforms to those series, meaning that all episodes of its new shows’ current season—known as the “full stack”—will be available on cwtv.com and The CW app, until 30 days before the start of the next season. At that point, the series produced by Warner Bros. TV (including Batwoman) [will move to HBO Max,](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/warnermedias-new-hbo-max-snaps-up-streaming-rights-for-friends-from-netflix/) while the CBS TV-produced Nancy Drew [will be available on CBS All Access.](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/cbs-all-access-expands-content-slate-as-streaming-space-heats-up/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the Netflix bump to count on, “the biggest challenge we all have is to get the Netflix viewer, who may not pay attention to us, to come and look at our shows,” Pedowitz [told Adweek last fall](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/). “We’re going to have to be very smart about it.""",7,1584641396,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fleo8u/all_american_one_of_broadcasts_leastwatched_shows/,television,1

flel1q,ix0WXOeip4V6,"'All American,' One of Broadcast’s Least-Watched Shows, Is Now No. 1 on Netflix","An ever-fascinating dynamic, via [Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/all-american-one-of-broadcasts-least-watched-shows-is-now-no-1-on-netflix/) ($):

&gt;During its two seasons, The CW’s drama All American has barely made a dent in the linear ratings, and is in fact one of broadcast’s least-watched primetime shows.  
&gt;  
&gt;But on Netflix, it’s a completely different story. After Season 2 was added to the streaming service on Tuesday, it shot to the top of Netflix’s most popular shows in the U.S., and has occupied the No. 1 spot among all Netflix movies and TV shows for the past two days.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s the most recent example of what The CW network president Mark Pedowitz has called the “Netflix bump,” as his younger-skewing network’s shows like Riverdale find a large audience on Netflix that did not watch the series on linear. The network then tries to entice those new Netflix fans back to The CW to watch or stream the next season’s episodes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Season 2 of All American, which follows high school quarterback Spencer James (played by Daniel Ezra), was tied for 201st among all primetime broadcast shows this season in the adults 18-49 demo, with a 0.4 rating, according to Nielsen’s most current metrics. It averaged 1.1 million total viewers, which is tied for 227th this season among all primetime broadcast shows.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it’s been No. 1 on Netflix since Season 2 moved to the platform on March 27. Netflix doesn’t share total viewership figures, but its Top 10 list, [released in February](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-adds-top-10-feature-to-list-its-most-popular-shows-and-movies-each-day/), gives some insight as to the shows and movies that are doing particularly well among the service’s more than 61 million U.S. households.  
&gt;  
&gt;The CW was uniquely positioned to benefit from a “Netflix bump” given that under a previous deal with the streaming service, the full season of every series on the network moved to Netflix just eight days after airing its season finale on The CW. That gave Netflix viewers several months to stream episodes, as opposed to many SVOD deals, in which full seasons do not become available on a streaming service until 30 days before the next season is set to return on its linear network.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is the second time that All American has benefited from the “Netflix bump,” since it also helped the low-rated series secure a Season 2 renewal last year. At the Television Critics Association’s press tour last summer, Pedowitz said the show enjoyed a Riverdale-like surge in popularity upon its availability on Netflix. While the [network “believed” in All American](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/the-cw-sets-new-digital-strategy-as-netflix-deal-lapses/) despite its meager ratings on linear, its [“phenomenal”](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/) success on Netflix was part of the thinking behind bringing the show back for a sophomore season.  
&gt;  
&gt;(The CW has already renewed All American for Season 3, as part of a move in January to [pick up almost its entire current slate for next season](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/the-cw-renews-13-shows-including-batwoman-riverdale-and-the-flash/).)  
&gt;  
&gt;All American and Riverdale aren’t the only shows to make a bigger splash on Netflix than on linear. You, which barely made a peep when Season 1 debuted on Lifetime in fall 2018, saw a huge surge of viewers when it moved to Netflix: [40 million households watched](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/netflix-now-has-139-million-subscribers-and-says-it-competes-with-fortnite-more-than-hbo/) at least 70% of a Season 1 episode in You’s first four weeks on the service, according to Netflix.  
&gt;  
&gt;While The CW has also seen a “Netflix bump” from shows like In the Dark, the network can no longer rely on that to boost for its new shows, following [a digital strategy shift last year when its Netflix deal lapsed](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/). While previously-running shows will continue to migrate to Netflix, The CW’s new series—including Batwoman, Nancy Drew and Katy Keene—will move to new digital homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;The network has secured in-season streaming rights on its digital platforms to those series, meaning that all episodes of its new shows’ current season—known as the “full stack”—will be available on cwtv.com and The CW app, until 30 days before the start of the next season. At that point, the series produced by Warner Bros. TV (including Batwoman) [will move to HBO Max,](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/warnermedias-new-hbo-max-snaps-up-streaming-rights-for-friends-from-netflix/) while the CBS TV-produced Nancy Drew [will be available on CBS All Access.](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/cbs-all-access-expands-content-slate-as-streaming-space-heats-up/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Without the Netflix bump to count on, “the biggest challenge we all have is to get the Netflix viewer, who may not pay attention to us, to come and look at our shows,” Pedowitz [told Adweek last fall](https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/tv-cw-new-shows-netflix-bump-digital-strategy/). “We’re going to have to be very smart about it.”",0,1584641095,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/flel1q/all_american_one_of_broadcasts_leastwatched_shows/,television,1

Lots of twists and turns and unexpected things occur. It's less about the technology and more about why its being created and the implications that could come from it. It's on FX as well as Hulu.

fl6pb2,DrewwwBjork,Idea for Sequel to That '70s Show,"Let's say it's 1991. George H.W. is President. Bill Clinton was still Governor of Arkansas. Flowers and smiley faces are replaced with posters of Nirvana. Shoulder pads start going out of style, and the world is shocked at the news of Freddie Mercury's death. Then the camera pans to Betsy Kelso, the precocious 12-year-old daughter of Michael Kelso and Brook Rockwell. Life in Point Place, Wisconsin, hasn't changed much since 1979. Even the water tower is still standing: green hand giving the finger and all. Relationships evolved however.

Eric and Donna are currently separated. The stress from Donna going on book tours and Eric staying home with the kids got to them. To make matters worse, Eric's sister, Laurie, died as a result of the crack epidemic. On the bright side, Red and Kitty are still enjoying their retirement as a result of Red accepting the buyout from Muffler Master.

Fez and Jackie broke up a couple years after getting together after she found him in bed with the landlord. Jackie is now a real estate agent since she has the gifts of pizzazz, lying, and being a cutthroat. In fact, the first property she sold was the apartment building Fez lived in.

Fez wasn't the only person in the gang without a home. Hyde owned and operated Grooves for a few years until the police raided the back room and found a marijuana growing operation. He spent the next few years in prison and just got out. Eric picked him up outside the prison gates and took him in as a third roommate with Fez.

Finally, Michael and Brooke got married in 1980 since Michael moved to Chicago, and nobody there wanted to date a dumbass or a single mother. Their sex life, while similar to Bob's and Midge's, drives Betsy crazy much like Donna's parents did to her, and it often forces Betsy to venture out around Point Place with the Forman kids. The story goes on from there.

Notes:

* Much like *Young Sheldon* is to *The Big Bang Theory*, this new show could be like that to *That '70s Show* but with more mature humor.
* ""Bad Reputation"" by Joan Jett could be the title song since it's about a girl who doesn't care about her bad reputation (i.e. Betsy) and was released in 1980 (i.e. the year That '70s Show finally closes on).",14,1584607111,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fl6pb2/idea_for_sequel_to_that_70s_show/,television,1

What are some stand-out episodes of tv you've seen so far this year?

I'll comperhensively mention a bunch of what I've seen:

* Better Call Saul (best show of 2020 so far as well) - ""Magic Man"", ""50% Off"" ""The Guy for This""

* Curb Your Enthusiasm - ""Happy New Year"", ""You're Not Going to Get Me to Say Anything Bad About Mickey"", ""The Ugly Section"", ""Elizabeth, Margaret and Larry""

* BoJack Horseman - ""Xerox of a Xerox"", ""The View from Halfway Down""

* Homeland - ""Chalk One Up"", ""Chalk Two Down""

* The New Pope - ""Episode 7"", ""Episode 8"", ""Episode 9""

* High Maintenance - ""Cycles"", ""Trick""

* The Outsider - ""Fish in a Barrel"", ""Roanoke""

* Strike Back - ""Part 5""

* Westworld - ""Parce Domine"" (cautiously optimistic here after not really liking most of S2)

* Devs - ""Episode 1"", ""Episode 2""

I'd probably give the nods to Better Call Saul's ""The Guy for This"", Curb's ""The Ugly Section"", High Maintenance's ""Cycles"" and The New Pope ""Episode 7"" as my absolute favorites.",10,1584597457,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fl4zgj/best_episodes_of_tv_in_2020_so_far/,television,1

fl4v0t,KensukeTanabe,What are the chances of a Streaming crash happening in the same vein as the Video game crash of 1983?,"For the unaware, the video game crash of 1983 was a time of recession in the video game industry in the USA that was caused due to market saturation of game consoles and available games, plus waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. It wasn't until the success of the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) in 1985 that console gaming was able to get back to its feet. Now what does this have to do with streaming, I just want to clarify that these are my opinions and I would like to hear yours.

Its seems by around 2023, every media company is going to have their own streaming platform and it is only a matter of time before cable TV is completely dead. However some of these platforms especially when it comes to TV and Movies, don't have much to offer other than maybe 1 or 3 good shows. They are many good shows and movies being overloked because their is way to many streaming platform that people have to subscribe to just to watch that one show and never use the platform again.  As we have seen in the news, this has lead to are rise in piracy and streaming has made it much easier. The Mandalorian was voted the most pirated show in 2019, and it is only a matter time before people get so overwhelmed by so many streaming platforms that they decide to start watching illegally. That's the thing this whole approach that companies have of taking their ball and going home (or in this case taking their properties and making it into its own streaming service you have to pay for every month) it's so ridiculous. When it was just basically Hulu and Netflix things were simple and easy. Now you basically need a diagram to show you where various shows are. Of course that doesn't bother me or my many new privateer friends Yar har.  

Jokes aside, I feel there will be a massive streaming crash akin to the gaming crash of 83 due to too many services in the near future. Do I want it to happen? Well Hopefully this would lead to 3-4 services being the main stay similar to only having 3 consoles and PC, but that's just my selfishness. I just don't people have the patience to pay and monitor different platform when cable allowed them to have different channels under one cervices.",5,1584596853,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fl4v0t/what_are_the_chances_of_a_streaming_crash/,television,1

It's calming and interesting to watch the craftspeople work, but the emotional punch is seeing the tattered and broken items restored and the happiness they bring their owners. The repair people are all very charming and kind.

fkxmkw,pm_me_reason_to_livx,I recommend the witty bollocks-centered comedy My Left Nut (BBC Three).,"My Left Nut is a BBC Three presentation, adapted from a book/stage-play of the same name by Micheal Patrick and Oisin Kearney, which apparently is loosely based on the writer's (Micheal) experience. It's about a teenage boy 'Mick', discovering a large swelling on his left testicle, and yes it is as awkwardly hilarious and in some ways terrifying as it sounds. A perfectly ludicrous premise for a TV series. 

My Left Nut not as visually obscene or vulgar a TV series as it sounds though (or as I would've wanted it to be), but it's still quite grotesque dialogue-wise as Mick's faulty testicle is often talked about in overly-descriptive manner. And of course there are talks of sex, masturbation, anal-play and other stuff you'd see on dickdrainers.com, as the series leans into the depths of a teenage boy's mind going through puberty.

My Left Nut is witty, sharp and occasionally quite touching as Mick goes through these 3-episode panicking in fear that he has testicle cancer, and hoping none of his friends or his newly found love interest notices the huge bulge in his pants. It's 3-episodes, basically movie-length, and though it could've had more it's concise and very entertaining.

fkx09y,daniel_smales88,"Pose (2018) has quickly become my favourite show about family, acceptance, love and community.","While initially hesitant about whether or not I would enjoy Pose, can’t say I speak particularly highly of other Ryan Murphy shows, after episode 2 had finished I knew I was hooked. Everything from the music, characters, settings, costumes had me so engrossed. 

Pose is not my normal go to when it comes to television. I usually find my self deep into a true crime series or fantasy but my wife wanted to watch something different and had heard positive stuff. The positive stuff was correct and we fell in love. 

It’s by no means a perfect show and at times incredibly cheesy but this is all balanced to create something that had me crying and laughing. 

The balls themselves take centre stage just like all the characters do. We have our favourites. Pray Tell anyone? Anyway, I just wanted to let everyone know that they really should give it a shot if they are looking for something different. 

In these dark times we need positivity, family, each other and most of all drag queens.",8,1584564963,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fkx09y/pose_2018_has_quickly_become_my_favourite_show/,television,3

fkw0no,Alec122,"Tim Allen's sitcom ""Last Man Standing"" is kinda odd...","It's not a great sitcom. I wish it tone down the anti liberal jokes, not because I don't like anti liberal humor, as I love ""South Park"", as much it feels forced and doesn't really fit with the tone of the show. I even agree with some of the attitudes of Tim Allen's character, but the show is doing some very common sitcom family story, than Tim Allen randomly walks in and says random anti-liberal comments, and it just takes you out of the show. The adults on the show are fine, and Tim Allen's co-workers, Kyle and his boss, are probably the best characters on the show, along with his youngest daughter, Eve, as I can already tell the kid who plays her is way too good for the show. Nancy Travis as the wife is fine, if not really that memorable. However, the most odd thing about it is the constant re-castings. They've had 2 actresses play the oldest daughter, 2 actresses play the second oldest daughters, and 3 kids play the son of the oldest daughters. 2 actors play the boyfriend and father of the kid. So, whats up with that? It's this weird mix of recasting's, attempts at edgy political stuff, and generic as hell stuff that feels like a 90s sitcom.",25,1584561549,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fkw0no/tim_allens_sitcom_last_man_standing_is_kinda_odd/,television,0

It's so distinctive that once you hear it, you can't unhear it, and you will hear it all the time watching popular sitcoms.

I found a compilation of it from HIMYM, but it's a bit quick on the cuts, and I'm trying to find a better compilation that I know exists out there somewhere, but can't find.

The HIMYM compilation is here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YguljAFU3Bc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YguljAFU3Bc) 

Anyone know where the larger compilation is?",10,1584506642,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fkjw57/the_wilhelm_scream_of_laugh_tracks/,television,1

fki0vf,We1rd000,5 MCU Villains That Should Never Be On Screen," Below is a list of the 5 best villains that should never appear on the screen.M.O.D.O.K.

📷

M.O.D.O.K. Stands for mental (/Mobile/Mechanized) designed only for killing. M.O.D.O.K. He started life like George Tarleton, a scientist in advanced ideas mechanics (A.I.M) and he is the poster child of what happens when the line between genius and madness completely disappears.

Used as the Petrie dish for A.I.M. Experiencing with mutation against his will Tarlton was left as a giant head, with no physical body, only tiny appendages. Walk around on a mechanically heavily armed floating chair. In comic books, he is a great villain and worthy of sinister schemes and smarter than most Villains and heroes.

No matter how awesome enemies might be on the printed page, there's not much you can do to get movie fans to take a seriously floating head - no matter how deadly he is. Especially when he has tiny T-Rex arms.

Hyperion

📷

Hyperion has many iterations within the Marvel universe. Portrayed as a hero and villain, in the grand scheme of things, many see him falling on the side of the villain. Hyperion is another one better on the page then he will be on the screen.

Known as ""Marvel's"" **Superman** with his superhuman powers and shady history, the MCU is likely to keep out of Hyperion. Another villain would be one-dimensional, the last thing that MCU villains need. Also, some fans will resist him as evil if they are fans of hero stories. he Shows many potential problems to give him screen time.

The Void

📷

Robert Reynolds, a harmless high school student, took a potion and gained superpowers that transformed him into Sentry - all that is light and good. This strength is driven by emotions and can be destroyed if not checked. As a result, another character was created to counter this effect - **Void**. For everything is the **Sentry**, The Void is the opposite - dark and evil.

For every person Sentry saves, one will be killed by Void. Though a very complex and developed character, this is just very dark for MCU. This will lead to problems in how to defeat Void and staging the showdowns. It is another story that only works on paper.

Galactus

📷

Galactus is one of the best villains in Marvel and is simply more powerful to work on screen. He makes **Thanos** look like a hairdryer with the boost button. Galactus was initially a human being from the planet Taa named **Galan**. His planet was a paradise, excelling in everything Social and scientific. Before his planet finished forming completely, **the Big Bang** destroyed everything except Galan

The stars never really went far, but Marc webb of 500 days and summer and The Amazing Spiderman  is behind the making of it....

That made me wonder if there's a possibility that coronavirus could lead to delays for shows that are currently airing (or perhaps about to air). E.g. suppose there's still some compositing to do for your epic CGI-heavy finale, but then the company handling that work has to shut down due to an office outbreak (and for obvious reasons can't take their work home with them).

**A Plot** \- a new virus has everyone on edge. The Winslow family inform the kids that they will self-quarantine to protect Estelle. Eddie is so angry, because he and Waldo were planning on going to a big Spring Break party this week.

**B Plot** \- with Chicago shutting down, Carl is asked to work double shifts. Concerned about his friend, Steve Urkel designs a bulky containment suit to keep Carl safe in the streets.

**Act 2**  
**A -** Eddie gets caught sneaking out by Laura. She tells him it’s dangerous, but he goes to the party anyway. He and his friends have a great time dancing to generic music and eating snacks.

**B -** Steve has Carl try on his new containment suit. It has so many bells and whistles. Carl gets gets caught in the suit, and falls down. Steve says, “did I do that?.” The audience loses their minds.

**A -** Eddie comes home, and is caught by Harriette. She was worried, and is now angry for Eddie’s carelessness. While they argue, Eddie gets a call. It’s Waldo, his grandma was just diagnosed with COVID-19. Eddie and Harriette embrace.

**Act 3**  
**B-** Carl goes on patrol without his containment suit. Things start to get out of control. He becomes surrounded by sick citizens, and they begin to close in. Out of nowhere, Steve comes barreling into view. He dives in front of Carl before a sneeze can reach his shirt. Carl says, “Steve... you saved my life.” Laying on the ground as if he just took a bullet for Carl, Steve tells Carl he loves him like a dad. As Carl looks lovingly at Steve, the suit freaks out, Carl falls, and the audience laughs.

**A-** the family sits in the living room together, and Harriette breaks the news to everyone that Waldo’s grandma passed away. They all commit to respecting the quarantine, and attempt to embrace before remembering to stay 6 feet apart. The Winslows air hug, and the audience claps.

fk5rk0,TFunkeIsQueenMary,"Has anyone watched “100 Humans” on Netflix? It’s a social experiment reality show that tackles humanity’s most burning questions. It does so very, very poorly.","Here’s what the show is about.

&gt; A social experiment where 100 individuals will be a part of interactive experiments exploring sex, happiness, torture and all the other aspects of being human. [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11823088/)

Here’s what the show is (to me, at least):

It’s bland. It’s boring. It’s fundamentally broken. It simply shouldn’t have been made; not with whoever is behind it. Here’s why. 

It spits in the face of proper science and its rules for fact-finding. In the process of trying to **highlight** real problems like gender equality, racial profiling, heteronormative society, ageism, tattoo stigma, etc. — it ends up **minimizing** these issues through reductive pseudoscience. Taking a minuscule amount of people and using that same group *every episode* to prove these inclinations/behavior makes the results easily dismissible by anyone who made it passed 7th grade science class. Yet the show presents the findings as a genuine look into our country and its pitfalls. Every conclusion could be correct and it still wouldn’t be admissible by the processes they employed.

Now, they try and cover a whole lot in 8 episodes... yet manage to make every one of them drag. Between the horrible humor, impromptu stand up, and boring cast; there were truly no diamonds in the rough. The closest being a gentlemen singing a (hopefully) improvised song about how to play tic-tac-toe, and cracking well timed jokes amidst 3 hosts who seriously didn’t make me laugh a single time.

So, here’s an example of one the experiments, and I apologize if I don’t explain this too well, I saw it last night and woke up needing to rant, forgive me:

It’s a relationship test. They had 3 women stand on one side of a room and 3 men on the other. It was up to the “human” subject to pick which people were actual couples. Now, going into this you’d assume that the men and women are separated because they’d be paired together... wrong! Two women were married and two men were dating. They were trying to prove that people were prejudiced in their view of relationships — that we are heteronormative (we 100% are, but this was a shit example). The subjects were allowed to ask questions, but none were concerned with their sexuality. To me, and I hope science/psychology would support my view here... grouping the men and women *separate* but proportional, you are telling the subjects brain that they need to pair them off by picking one from each group. Not even the self-identifying queer woman chose a gay couple because the setup was clearly **trying** to make it difficult for people to acknowledge they could in fact be homosexual. Why couldn’t they just make one big group and allow the contestants to choose two people at a time? Then there isn’t a literal visualization of heterosexual pairings. 

Here’s my largest problem with this show, and it’s a glaring issue when you try and present the findings as legitimate or scientific — they are PUSHING people into narratives. Rather than setting things up as equally and consistent as possible, they mold things ever so slightly to align people with whatever societal issue they are targeting in that episode. Noble cause, disrespectful tactic. I read an article where one of the hosts said that the show wasn’t “edited or tweaked to show how happy everyone is” — and I’d agree. It was setup to do the **opposite**. Maybe I’m crazy, maybe this is all unintentional and I’m seeing what I want, but this has been something I’ve consistently noticed with a large number of experiments. 

Look, these things exist. I get that they wanted to start a conversation, and do it in a way that was still entertaining and fun — that doesn’t break your brain and heart after one episode. But I can’t help but think this is simply a disservice to the complicated issues they try and tackle here. 

Anyway... one of the worst reality shows Netflix has created imo and I feel genuinely embarrassed for the professionals that attached their names to this project — including, apparently, people with real PhD’s. I would say cancel it, but the idea of the show intrigues me. 

So I’ll say this to the creators: Be better. The attempt to reduce the shock or aversion to these experiments, to make them more palatable, and to pigeonhole narratives with reductive experiments... it’s a disservice to the issues themselves.

I figured since I plan on staying home most of the time over the coming weeks that now would be a good of time as any to start up the series.",19,1584401382,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjusc7/thinking_of_starting_the_sopranos_for_the_first/,television,6

[From his own account](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9zvkEHBRjf/?utm_source=ig_embed):

&gt; Greetings from Norway! Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country's Center for Disease Control's website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions.",75,1584392770,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjseuh/game_of_thrones_actor_kristofer_hivju_confirms_he/,television,7

fjrpn6,Mrs_Schyster,COVID Captain America,"*Members of an exclusive Montana club have surreptitiously guarded Chris Evan's secret COVID-19 infection by shushing community members.*

According to several sources in connection to the matter, Chris Evans is rumored to have contracted COVID-19 and is self-quarantined in Big Sky, Montana. Big Sky is known for its world-renowned skiing and the Yellowstone Club. Beyond the majestic views and pillowy cotton powder (er, um, *power*?), Yellowstone Club is a celebrity hideaway in which Chris has been a member of for years.

After being short of breath and feverish, Chris quarantined himself in his 8,125 square foot cabin in the Yellowstone Club gated community with his social media manager, Jeff Born, and hairdresser, Sylvia McDonald. Since reporting this story, I have reached out to both Jeff and Sylvia for comment. They have each claimed to have signed a non-disclosure agreement. 

According to Montana state reporting, Chris has denied testing and has been avoiding ""public surveillance in lieu of scrutiny"" regardless of his symptoms. Chris’s social media manager quoted him as saying, “my health is none of their business. If my family and friends don’t want the Coronavirus, well, then, they should practice social distance. But I don’t think they can resist, and it’s not my problem.” 

Chris Evan’s Yellowstone Club neighbors have shut down tweets and paparazzi, citing that “this hysterical media farce has gone on long enough.” According to a close source, Chris is able to charm anyone into believing anything. So if he says he doesn’t have the Coronavirus, people will believe him, continue working for him, and get infected themselves.

Chris has not officially been tested in fear of mandatory identification (i.e. Tom Hanks, Heidi Klum, Bella Hadid). Despite available COVID-19 testing kits for the very sick and the very rich, Chris doesn't want to risk exposing the true dangers of the virus to the public, his employers, and his fans.

Chris cannot afford to risk the public’s (or Trump’s administration’s) confidence. If Chris is viewed as weak, the fear is that he will lose at least two-thirds of his fans (according to a survey of a Chris Evan’s fan club). As a result of the COVID-19 rumors, the production of his upcoming thrillers, *The Devil All The Time*, and, *Greenland*, might be stalled or even canceled. 

In an effort to support Trump's propaganda efforts, the Yellowstone Club is taking measures to keep Coronavirus victims in the shadows. Those with parallel political and financial interests are systematically silencing locals in an attempt to keep citizens from mass hysteria, such as in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. According to a local resident, Britney Howard isn't worried about the ""spread of infection. There have been literally zero Coronavirus cases in Montana. I have Trump to thank for that. He cares about the everyday lives of regular people."" Chris Evans agreed to meet with me, but when an attempt to fact check this story was made his butler couldn’t unlock the door using the retinal scanner and voice recognition module.",3,1584390208,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjrpn6/covid_captain_america/,television,0

fjr5ja,bismuthwasframed,Can we discuss Hunters please?,"That twist at the end? Half of me loved the retribution, the other half was super offended. I don’t want to spoil things for anyone.

But I’ve got issues with it. I was raised Christian in a predominantly Orthadox Jewish community. Which was hard, not going to try and sugar coat it. But also helped shape my views regarding the world as I grew up. 

I don’t subscribe to any of it, but could not help feeling rage at the reveal. I feel like the twist does more damage than good and while I loved the show? The twist at the end left me feeling helpless and if I felt helpless I can’t imagine what actual Jewish people felt. After everything endured. Even to this day here, not far in the future and safe from such things. 

It’s like the whole show was a prank on the Jewish collective. Even with how it all actually ended. I just. I mean. I don’t know Its very upsetting and it only works to make people paranoid. More so than they already are. 

Pacino did such a good job in the roll that I dont think I can ever watch a movie with him in it again. Without associating him with the character in Hunters. 

Honestly? I’m m super disappointed in the shows creators. Terrible way to end the first season. Shocking yes. Appropriate? No.",3,1584388236,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjr5ja/can_we_discuss_hunters_please/,television,0
fjr00f,CuriousPossibility7,Tv tropes that you are comfortable with,"Tropes have generally negative connotation. Something hackneyed, predictable, no new news etc. But do you have any TV trope in mind which is actually a comfort watch for you, something you enjoy or excites you despite being a trope after all ?

My comfort/ favorite tropes, guilty pleasures

1. Grey Morality .. oh long live the trope. A lot of work has happened here. Notable - GOT, Hannibal, Jimmy McGill .. but it's everywhere
2. Odd couples coming together for something and striking a chemistry... functional or dysfunctional... who may eventually get together or in non-romantic relationships influencing each other in some way. My fav pairs - Marty and Rust, Linden and Holder, Ellie and Alec Hardy, Jessie and Walt.
3. Disaster tropes.
4. The misfit cyber punk trope
5. The reliable haunted house ! I love it.. haunted house, weird kid, random weird events occur, pet spooked, mom worried.
6. Unrelated events getting connected to give shape to a mystery or an event.

My least comfortable tropes

1. Busy guy forgets birthdays
2. preachy feminism tropes.. female characters written beyond believability and trying to hard to be the strong independent woman who needs no man.. ( I am a woman between)
3. Stoic guy, who is also clumsy at making breakfast ( and forgets birthdays) ..
4. from nerdy to beautiful (specially for girls)
5. This can actually be done well at times but has become predictable with overuse ""most innocent bloke is the culprit"" whoddunit trope, was writing in the broadchurch forum. There are a list of suspects and some borderline cases, then there are people who are being too nice or are just there doing nothing and you can bet the real culprit is amongst the last two groups.
6. Past sexual assault trope
7. subverting .. like not solving cliffhangers in the next episode while it's obvious like Jon Snow wasn't dead took 2 episodes to reveal, or who's alive after Mizumono was revealed after 1-2 episodes.
8. Pointless love triangles when you know and can predict who the soulmates are.
9. Sex after minimum relationship building, you can tell the scene is shot to show off and objectify and sexualise ( the woman's body most of the time)
10. Sexualising women's body and not the men's.. I mean women love that stuff too, what's for the girls to see if you not show some yummy male bod with some level of objectification :P
11. Tv labor and delivery.. perfectly fine would be moms suddenly leak a full bucket water then scream badly in the hospital bed giving birth.
12. Queer-bait. Or use will-they-wont-they in any relationship straight or otherwise to bait fans. Stop doing that.",1,1584387676,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjr00f/tv_tropes_that_you_are_comfortable_with/,television,1

fjnzon,NewClayburn,I hope the success of Westworld doesn't cost us a good Westworld TV show in the near future. (Mild spoilers.),"Obviously Westworld is good, but it's not really *Westworld*.  It's more of an Altered Carbon type show, and the tangent happened pretty early on.

Still, the original premise of Westworld is really good, and I hope we can get a TV show that really is about a wild west theme park with robots that are potentially alive depending on your interpretation.  No technological revolution needed.  Just a classic Jurassic Park but with cowboys.  It doesn't have to take a T-Rex to San Diego, or heaven-forbid have some little clone girl release a bunch of dinosaurs into Wine Country.  

The park is enough.  Let's stay there and hang out a bit.  I hope they still make that show someday.",13,1584377153,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjnzon/i_hope_the_success_of_westworld_doesnt_cost_us_a/,television,1

fjn665,Saaville,"CHEERS! ""Beantown Pandemic""","

Boyfriend and I are debating how the characters on cheers would be reacting during the pandemic.

Cheers (Original Cast) “Beantown Pandemic”

Dianne - Shows up to work in DIY hazmat suit made of puff blouses, yellow rubber kitchen gloves, spray bottle of unknown liquid. Full out panic frantic babbling, there is no more toilet paper at the store.

Carla - Survival mode. Bragging about the hand sanitizer, Toilet paper, and food she has been hoarding for weeks, That her 6 kids are selling at for huge profit online. She refuses to let Dianne have any, even when Dianne pretends to suck up to her. Openly carrying a hand gun she bought in NH. Is wearing cute mini handgranade earrings.

Cliff - Full conspiracy mode, Russia is responsible. Insists he knows about the history of influenza and compares it to the knowledge of the coronavirus. Insists its not a big deal and it will blow over in a few days. Keeps telling anicdotes about the Spanish flu and how his family has a strong constitution and survived the Black Plague. Alludes that mail carriers are the real heroes for continuing to deliver the mail.

Norm - Has a handkerchief he used to blow his nose to handle his beer. Business as usual.

Woody - Wears a surgical mask but lifts it up every time he talks.

Frasier - Swings from one extreme to the other, is of two minds. Is the world ending or is this just a forgettable blip in our history. Tries to imagine what the world would be like, all that humanity has achieved (mainly the arts and sciences) being wiped out forever. Dwelling in his beer. On the other hand Lilith has a fever.

Sam - his only concern is how he is going to keep the bar open during the quarantine. He constantly gets calls from numerous dates canceling on him throughout the episode. Diane chastises him for not caring about the health of the elderly. Carla insists on answering the phone and jokes that the bar never has more than 50% of it’s occupancy rating anyway.",2,1584374183,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjn665/cheers_beantown_pandemic/,television,1

fjhk9p,brage-at-vuu,I’ve listed 24 great YouTube channels and podcasts making Westworld content.,"So, in preparation for the new season of Westworld, I decided to make a list of the Youtubers and podcasts I’ve enjoyed over the last two seasons. From **Alt Shift X** to **Decoding Westworld** to **The Normies**, they are a varied collection - the only criteria were that

* They needed to have ❤◦.¸**sparked joy**¸.  ◦✿  with me — (i.e. I enjoyed them)

* Somewhat unique — (i.e. Where there were a lot of videos about the same subject matter, I tried to choose just one)

A lot of these creators will be making content for season 3 as well, so this is a good time to find the ones you enjoy.

If you have some channels and pods I’ve missed, I’m sure you’ll tell me respectfully in the comments and that I won’t feel dumb at all.
Here goes:

Youtube:

1. [Alt-Shift-X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb7r9m-DYpU) — In addition to being the best friend of any lore-obsessed GoT fans, Alt-Shift-X made stellar content for season 1 &amp; 2 of WW. Hopefully, they’ll do the same this season.
2. [HBO \(obvs.\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsWywWffjRg) — HBO have already added some great behind the scenes content.
3. [The Normies](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbv2OBLeYiYe7B6WgPDnLow/videos) — My favourite of the people-watching-show-and-talking-about-it category :-)
4. [Wisecrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkDXcP7JNOw) —  Some great analyses / breakdowns of WW - including looks at the awesome soundtrack.
5. [The Take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYtFYowC7LU) — Video essays on WW - a lot of awesome stuff.
6. [Nerdwriter1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kSGkGKwp9U) — Although I don’t necessarily think he understands how actors work, Nerdwriter always notices things worth talking about and present them beautifully.
7. [Looper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLzq5xm896k) — In-depth look at nerd culture and a lot of content.  
8. [ScreenCrush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69StvkKgSbw) — Good recaps, lists and summaries. 
9. [Cinematica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMu0btOabis) — One of the Westworld timelines that are actually less confusing than watching the show itself. 
10. [The Warp Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY-uvz_Vem8) — Do you want a recap rap? Is that something you want? Someone to rap a recap for you? Well then guess whose lucky day it is?
11. [Vanity Fair \(w/Jimmi Simpson\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwqfoTOdXL4) — Vanity Fair has some great videos on YT, and have great access to the stars of shows and movies. 
12. [New Rockstars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1JgaowjU90) — Great explanations and summaries, and like looper, they produce a lot of content for shows like this.
13. [IAMAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekVUlvcw3Qg) — I love VFX breakdowns, and IAMAG have some good ones from Westworld.
14. [ArcadeCloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-hKQiA31P8) — Would you like the story of WW broken down in 3 minutes? ArcadeCloud does that for you.
15. [Jack’s Movie Reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoC6KP3iUS8) — Another channel that delivers analyses and breakdowns (along with - guess what - reviews!)
16. [MoreMojo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJsn5Go2WX0&amp;feature=youtu.be) — WatchMojo did episode-by-episode discussions for the first seasons, and they were enjoyable.
17. [Let Me Explain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRodkkRpz2Q) — They explain stuff. I like that.
18. [What The Flick?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CufFirHvnt8&amp;feature=youtu.be) — Reviews of the episodes. Another roundtable/discussion on an episode-by-episode basis.
19. [PBS Idea Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J62hmHFbho0) — Some interesting takes / analyses of ideas presented in Ww.
20. [Elle \(w/Jimmi Simpson\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDaHQDD1ghY) — Like Vanity Fair, Elle has great star access and uses it to make great content with the actors from the show.
21. [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHyUYg8X31c) — Not directly related to the show, but Kurzgesagt covers some of the discussions around AI and robots in best-in-class videos.
22. [Hippopotaman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y50nsmUVeVU) — Look, I don’t know what this guy’s pedigree is, but he covers the philosophical ‘backdrop’ of Westworld in ways I found very interesting.

Podcasts:

23. [Decoding Westworld](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-filmcast/decoding-westworld)
24. [Watching Westworld](http://baldmove.com/tag/watching-westworld/)

      
I hope you find something you enjoy here :-) I’ve added all the videos / podcasts to the episodes they cover in our app ([**VUU - for movies and TV**](https://apps.apple.com/app/vuu-for-movies-and-tv/id1405570575) - I hope it’s ok that I mention it?)

I genuinely don't remember the last time I was laughing out loud at my TV (wait actually I do. It was while watching The Other Two last year) The last episode with Young Grandma had Jamie Chung and Simu Liu parodying a 1960s Korean Drama series and I had to pause and rewind some moments because it was just SO good. The characters are all fun and interesting. The Grandma character is comedy GOLD. She's got this weird mix of wholesome yet raunchy and I live for her! And with cameos from amazing Asian American actors like Ming Na Wen make this one of my favorite comedies of the year!,11,1584340035,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjgflx/awkwafina_is_nora_from_queens_is_hysterical_and/,television,1
fjgfbl,M_asady,I think Damon Lindelof would be perfect for a X-Men or Fantastic 4 series.,"Both stories involve character more than plot which is where Lindelof shines, and both the story deals with Trauma while being mixed with Si-Fi. Both are stories about families/Love stories, again Lindelof's expertise. And both could go with Leftovers and Watchmen's episode formula of character driven episodes.

Seeing him do something with FF would be amazing. He can comtinue Stan Lee's FF stories of mixing Si-Fi with other stories. The only problem would be Marvel, which would want to keep the series open and up to their own plans, which might end up hurting the show. I feel like a limited run of FF from time to time without being meddled with, something like WandaVision would be amazing. But even with WandaVision I think Marvel has a lot of control so they could set up the story between that show and Loki and Dr Strange 2, so perhaps it still might be hard for Lindelof to work his story if he has to set up future stories for Marvel too.",11,1584339986,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjgfbl/i_think_damon_lindelof_would_be_perfect_for_a/,television,1

fjg49w,mirthquake,"If you're running out of new shows to watch, check out The Critic on Youtube. There are 2 seasons (1994-1995), and it's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.","The Critic is a largely forgotten gem of adult-oriented animation from the mid-90s. It shares some producers with the Simpsons, and the main character even appeared in a crossover Simpsons episode. 

Jay Sherman, a fat, bald, down-on-his-luck film critic living in Manhattan with his similarly unfortunate son, does his best to find romance and happiness and to be a good father in a world that seems stacked against him. He was raised by a wealthy family of WASPS and is clearly adopted.

Jay's sense of integrity leads him to rail against profit-oriented studio films and mainstream sentiments on his weekly television show despite pushback from his hyper-masculine boss. Famed film critics of the time, including Siskel, Ebert, and Gene Shallot, all voice their own exaggerated characters.

This show's whip-smart and quirky humor will appeal to those who appreciate '90s Simpsons, Seinfeld, Conan O'Brien, Woody Allen's better comedies, SNL, and the finer cutaway gags of Family Guy. The comedy is very New York and very Jewish, but has a wide appeal. 

This show is free and excellent. What have you got to lose?",21,1584338294,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fjg49w/if_youre_running_out_of_new_shows_to_watch_check/,television,1

fja6q7,bakedwafer,Donald Trump is the sad character William Feathersmith from The Twilight Zone.,"Trump is literally William Feathersmith from ""The Twilight Zone"" episode ""Of late I think of Cliffordville"".  

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Late_I_Think_of_Cliffordville

William J. Feathersmith, the 75-year-old president of a large corporation, is a sadistic man who has made his fortune by financially preying on others. One night, a drunken Feathersmith confesses to the janitor Mr. Hecate, that, having reached the height of success, he is left feeling empty and purposeless, and dreams of returning to his small hometown of Cliffordville, Indiana, to start life anew. Hecate says that Cliffordville happens to be his hometown as well.

Attempting to go home for the night, Feathersmith is instead taken by the elevator to the 13th floor, where he finds a travel agency that was not there the day before. Feathersmith quickly realizes that the agency's head, Miss Devlin, is the devil. She offers to fulfill his wish to return to 1910 Cliffordville, agreeing to his terms that he will look the same as he did then, but retain all memories of his first life, in exchange for almost all his liquidated worth, leaving him with $1,412. Because he knows which investments have succeeded and which have failed in the last 50 years, Feathersmith agrees.

Back in 1910 Cliffordville, he uses $1,403 to buy 1,403 acres of land which he knows to contain deposits of oil. He forgets, however, that the drill needed to access oil so far beneath the ground will not be invented until 1937. Feathersmith tries to woo the daughter of a bank owner but is startled that, rather than being the charming girl he remembers, she chatters incessantly and insists on entertaining guests with her shrill singing. Many of the stocks he invests in drop. He tries to ""invent"" devices such as a self-starter for automobiles, but does not know how to design them.",4,1584312527,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fja6q7/donald_trump_is_the_sad_character_william/,television,1

fj950q,Mnemosense,"Very late to the party, but I'm currently captivated by Black Mirror","This show's been around for a while and it's been on my To Watch list for years. Late last year I finally decided to get round to it, and after several months, I'm currently starting season 3.  

I think it took me so long because each episode is like a feature length ordeal that drains me emotionally each time. This is not binge TV in my opinion. You have to steel yourself for each episode.  

It's like watching a car crash in slow motion, I imagine the look on my face every episode is one of transfixed horror and amusement. Charlie Brooker is a genius. Masterclass writing they should use as examples in film school.  

He, and his fellow writers, never use technology as a gimmick or crutch, it is always a thematic tool. He never forgets the human drama and conflict, the relationships between characters that drives the plot to its usually horrifying conclusions. The humour is pitch black and the dystopic backdrop, though often recognisable from its inspired literary sci-fi sources, is always compelling.  

With season 3 the show transitioned to Netflix with bigger budget, so I'm expecting a little difference in focus. The first episode of season 3 (with a fantastic performance by Bryce Dallas Howard) didn't end in as bleak fashion as the episodes during the last two seasons, so hopefully there's more 'fun' dystopic hijinks in store for me... (no spoilers please!)  

Also, shout out to the Christmas special, a mindblowing episode jampacked with thought-provoking nightmares. (how is Jon Hamm not a bigger star in cinema?)  

If the show is on your To Watch list, I hope this post has inspired you to start it sooner rather than later. It's truly a show of our times...",16,1584308577,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fj950q/very_late_to_the_party_but_im_currently/,television,2

Your help would be  very appreciated and extremely useful to the project, so thank you in  advance. Unfortunately, my English is not perfect and I'm sorry for  that.

I don't mind it in a lot of cases, because that's all part of the comfort. Some of them, however, I find less bearable than others.

For me the most annoying one is probably when someone has information and need to pretend like they've heard it for the first time. They do the whole ""ThAt'S DeFiNeTeLy ThE FiRsT I'M hEaRInG oF tHaT"" bit.

I get that comedy doesn't always have to be in the realm of reality but it's just so off base from how someone would actually talk that it irks me.

fj5v0c,SomeKindaMech,How do you feel about shows that only vaguely commit to a time period?,"I don't just mean they don't set a specific date, but that the world depicted in the show is hard to pin down.

I think the most recent example would be the new Sabrina series. There were a couple lines about cell phones if I remember correctly, but no one has one. There have been plenty of 80s cultural elements, but there's no sign of a single computer at the mortal school and the whole thing has a distinct vibe much older than the 80s. On the other hand, the people in this rural mining town seem pretty modern in terms of their sensibilities.

Legion also did this to an extent, but it didn't stray from the late 60s early 70s that much. There are probably other examples I'm not thinking of or in shows I haven't seen.

Does this add a surreal layer that takes you out of the show? Or does it add to your enjoyment by decoupling it from real life historical events?",14,1584296751,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fj5v0c/how_do_you_feel_about_shows_that_only_vaguely/,television,1

fj512q,CaptainRyuk,Does the concept of TV watching stamina exist? Does anyone remember how difficult it was to finish their first TV series when they were younger because they still hadn't build up their watching stamina yet?,"I just finished Charmed today. This is the first time I finished a TV series with 1 hour long episodes and over 100 episode count. I started back in August but I went on and off watching it because not only did I start lots of other TV shows like Friends and Hellsing (all which I finished earlier than Charmed) but Charmed's 1 hour episodes left me exhausted. What happened was I'd watch 8 episodes on one day a week until February came  which at that point I finished every other series I started back in Fall. So I watched nothing but Charmed but even with this single-minded focus,I still took a few weeks off in between esp the final 3 seasons. So instead of finishing it off in Feb, I only finished it today.

I remember  when I was younger I could never finish 20 minute 26 episodes anime series because I lacked the patience to view through them. Evangelion, Love Hina, and so many more I tried watching multiple times as a teen but given up esp due to homework and other matters making me lose track of the series.

In college despite the more difficult workload, I finally instilled in me the stamina to binge not only 26 anime series but even hour long series like Spartacus and over 100 long ones like Psych. If I couldn't binge it straight on, I made it a priority to finish one episode a day before I focused on my homework or study time or went to exercise. So I was able to balance school and entertainment. Instead of simply doing homework first (and my free time being consumed as a result). Afterall losing 20 minutes of study time won'taffect the long run by itself and if you have too much homework, it wouldn't change a thing  either.

With that said I am curious if anyone else experienced what I did? Where you as a person have a very hard time watching even series you love and gave up many series until you finally developed stamina to watch?

fitw85,RusevReigns,My top 5 most overrated shows of the decade,"**Tonight I dine in downvote hell**

I started the 2010s having a lot of faith in TV critics and ended it having none. Some of it were the shows I loved that they missed. Some of it was hyping up ones that didn’t deserve it in my eyes. It felt like groupthink and the need for appraisal from either social media followers or their critic friends led to veering off the rails.

If you loved these shows, I’m not going to say you’re wrong. Personally I trust my opinion and I feel I’m right, but everyone responds differently emotionally to different things. And as a disclaimer, I’m not going to pretend I’ve seen every minute of shows I don’t like.

*Honorable mentions*

**The Good Wife** (#50 Rolling Stone, #53 The A.V. Club, #14 Paste Magazine)  – It’s polished for a network procedural and nails its cast. However something weird happened when it started being called the best drama on TV even when shows like Mad Men were still on air. I see too much of the case of the week format in its DNA for that, and its scripts often felt rushed either in the cases or adding and dropping subplots.

**The Handmaid’s Tale** (NR Rolling Stone, NR The A.V. Club, #74 Paste Magazine) – One of the most on the nose shows I’ve seen, the combination of physical abuse and rape scenes, endless close-ups and beyond amateur dialog made it unwatchable. However many people have turned on it in the second and third seasons making it unnecessary to include on the list. 

5. **The Crown** (NR Rolling Stone, #86 The A.V. Club, #17 Paste Magazine)

It feels like a wikipedia article re-enacted rather than having real psychological insight on the royal family, and not even an accurate depiction at that. With its Game of Thrones sized budget, at least it’s beautiful right? No! What part of The Crown is beautiful? Is the palette intended to invoke rainy, depressing London? Is it all the scenes of Elizabeth talking to advisors in a ordinary interior rooms? It looks more like a cheap BBC mini-series than a real visual feast like Downton Abbey. Where did the money go? There’s nothing wrong with a script driven royal family show, but the script is flat here.

**4. Hannibal** (#17 Rolling Stone, #12 The A.V. Club, #27 Paste Magazine)

Its dialog is spoken like it contains amazing philosophical insight, but is saying nothing at all. The combination is unbearable. Much of its acclaim is for Bryan Fuller’s visuals, but I actually find it an ugly show due to its cold palette and lighting. I care about that more than dripping paint around in dream sequences. I can respect it had a lot of ambition, but it ranks high on my worst shows I’ve seen this decade, not the best.

**3. The Leftovers** (#1 Rolling Stone, #7 the A.V. Club, #43 Paste Magazine)

Great art sometimes only needs a needle to bleed your emotions, but The Leftovers prefers smashing you in the face with a sledgehammer with its grief porn. It removes the most entertaining parts of Lost and doubles down on Lindelof’s religious metaphors. No show in history has ever been more already convinced it’s a masterpiece. Based on effort alone it’s more interesting than the other four shows in my top five, but it’s also the single most acclaimed show of the decade which ups its ranking.

**2. The Americans** (#6 Rolling Stone, #5 The A.V. Club, #3 Paste Magazine)

It’s not tightly directed or plotted enough to be great from espionage alone, but it’s too committed to its pulp side to be all in on the psychology and fear at home. It’s not bad at either side, but not great either. The Stan plot pales compared to Hank on Breaking Bad. Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys are great, but average writing and directing prevent it from being anything more. Unlike The Leftovers or Hannibal which took big swings if misses, I just don’t think this show was very special one way or the other. Yet it was regularly called the best drama on TV for much of its run.

**1. BoJack Horseman** (#4 Rolling Stone, #5 The A.V. Club, #11 Paste Magazine)

The majority of acclaim for BoJack comes for showing depression, but it spends far more time as a comedy, and therefore I choose to judge it as one. I find its comedy to unfunny and as lazy a Hollywood satire as it gets. It’s also difficult to balance the irreverent skin deep comedy with its depression scenes, as if you establish a world where one of the most mature adult characters can’t tell she’s dating three kids in trenchcoats it’s harder to believe BoJack’s world or his emotions are real. BoJack claims to be deep, but feels shallow.",46,1584237522,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fitw85/my_top_5_most_overrated_shows_of_the_decade/,television,1

firkix,YapPac,"I finally finished Fear The Walking Dead (on Hulu), and there is plenty to Fear","Good god, how do you waste so much potential

&gt; AMC

Oh, yeah. Anyway, rather than have this be a post deconstructing the series and shaming it I decided to make a fun little list with my general thoughts of each season.

• Season 1 really isn't anything special. Sure it has some substance and Episode 2/3 is pretty decent, but overall, it's just boring.

• Season 2 is where the series kind of reaches its full potential. Plenty of locations, new characters and dynamics, especially in the second half of the season. 

• Season 3's first half, in my opinion, carries that momentum the previous season had quite nicely, until it all falls apart towards the end. I guess what happens with the dam is a good representation of what the season is like.

• Season 4 is just...bad. They had to bring in a main character from the main show to save it. The titlecards are unfortunately probably the best part, as they change up every episode.

Overall, it's just a waste. How they manage to kill every single character is insulting and the dialogue man, the dialogue.

But you know, it's not all bad. At least Travis stayed consistent, and Nick ended up being a pretty good character. And like I said, I really enjoyed the second half of Season 2.",39,1584227856,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/firkix/i_finally_finished_fear_the_walking_dead_on_hulu/,television,1

fimq2u,gogetakame,Hey everyone! I made a site for keeping track of everything you watch and helping you find things to watch!,"Hey everyone!
I wanted to share something I’ve been working on for some time that I hope you will find useful.
It’s called AddToTheList: https://www.addtothelist.com/

You can keep track of everything you’re watching with AddToTheList. You can rate, make notes, and mark which streaming service a title is on. You’ll also be able to see IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings for titles with links to each site if you want more information.

You can add your friends once they’ve signed up as well and then you can easily recommend each other things to watch. You’ll be able to easily see what your friends are watching to get a better idea of what to watch. You can also easily copy titles from other users to your own lists.

There are pre-populated Smart Lists that also give you ideas on what to watch. These range from Popular Shows to Upcoming Movies. These lists will update as you use the site more.

You’ll also be able to see when titles are coming to Netflix or Amazon Prime as well as when titles are leaving Netflix. Then you can plan what to watch better as well. (I’m planning to add Hulu soon.) All of these are only supported for USA.
You’ll also get recommendations on what to watch as you watch/rate titles.

You can view a sample user here to see how to organize your lists, but it’s entirely up to you how you want to do it:

fii50n,Frankfeld,The ultimate NBC Thursdays quarantine streaming guide,"They year is 2009. NBC premieres a little show titled Community. Followed by season 6 of The Office, Season 2 of Parks and Rec, and a few weeks later—the season 4 premier of 30 Rock. It was quite a time. 

Cut to 2018: /u/Frankfeld is on his 20th stream of 30 Rock. Tina Fey finishes up the famous live show with a simple outro where she declares “stay tuned for the office”. This piques my interest.  ‘I wonder which episode of The Office actually followed that night.’

So I went to Wikipedia and found the original broadcast dates for each episode. And this my journey into madness began. I started with season 1 of the office. Then I would alternate between Season 3 and season one of 30 Rock. Etc.... etc....

This turned out to be quite an experience. Shows would often follow the same theme around certain Holidays...some would reference the show that follows...my nostalgia would ramp up to ten as I slowly went through this odyssey. I couldn’t recommend it enough. 

To that end, I give you:
[My Ultimate NBC Thursdays Streaming Guide](https://imgur.com/a/TCOt8uz)

Follow all four shows in their original broadcast order. 

Some notes:
I tried my best to keep things in their original order, including when they would shuffle the schedule mid season, and when 30 rock switched to 10:30. I may have messed up a bit, but you’re more than welcome to let me know of any mistakes.

fihyke,Gabriels_Pies,Dave and relatuonships.,"I've been watching the new show Dave and I love it so far. While it makes me cringe a few times one thing it does really well is depicting this healthy relationship between the main character and his girlfriend. There's a few things you need to watch to really understand but the show does a great job of staying away from the normal comedy show relationship tropes. The girlfriend is super supportive of Dave's attempts to be a rapper, she's willing to compromise and be understanding when he says or does something dumb. Dave on the other hand makes dumb decision but learns from them. He puts himself in uncomfortable positions for her, he supports her teaching career, and he also is willing to apologize when he does something dumb. The show could have very easily takin a turn into ""dumb guy, bad boyfriend, girl leaves"" but instead so far it show more depth and respect for both people in the relationship.",2,1584190680,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fihyke/dave_and_relatuonships/,television,1

That said I re-read this [Vox article](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/5/15730378/the-leftovers-finale-review-best-series-ever) recently and I was really hit by these paragraphs

&amp;#x200B;

""We are living in a time that feels, to almost all of us, like more of an ending than a beginning. Politics has us at each other’s throats, and the planet is burning itself alive, and it’s difficult to imagine a humanity that exists in 2100 and isn’t somehow a completely different species.We have made it to the future, and it’s trying to kill us. But it’s also always the future, and life is always trying to kill us. The world is always ending, but it’s also always beginning.

Struggling against the meaningless nature of life is important, but so is remembering that meaning is what we make of it and that we can create meaning for each other. *The Leftovers* worked so well because it focused not on the flood, but on the Ark, on the people left aboard, watching the skies for a sign of something new. There’s all this water, all around us — but look at us, lucky us, we have a boat.""

Four weeks ago I stopped taking my anti-anxiety medicine that I had been taking for the past six years. It turns out this was a VERY BAD time to do this. I'm going to try to stay off them (they made me sleep 12-16 hours a day), but thinking about that show and reading Emily VanDerWerff's article has kind of calmed me in a way I haven't felt in the past couple weeks.

fhz6os,supergorl,My thoughts on Kingdom Season 2,"Just finished watching the 6 new episodes of Kingdom season 2!! 
It picks up right where the first season left off and gets to the zombie action right away. I felt like the series had great pacing and did not rush the progression of events. However, I was pretty disappointed with the lack of development for Yeong-Sin tho, his background story was resolved with literally one flashback and they didn't do anything with the character after that.
I did not expect Cho Hak-Ju to die at the hands of his daughter!! This was the best plot twist to me since she seemed to be completely under his control. I was initially confused as to why he was mad at his daughter for falsifying her pregnancy (since it mainly benefitted their family??). But I guess Hak-Ju had always been extremely nationalistic. All his actions were justified as ""looking after the royal family for the nation"". He viewed his family as superior and the only ones capable of ruling Joseon, so tainting the bloodline was not an option. He was also very accommodating to his nephew (the last male heir to their clan) even if he was pretty weak. 
The ending was also unexpected since my assumption was that Prince Chang would eventually fight and win to become king. Could they not have just exposed the queen's lies and returned the baby back to his mom?? 
I'm glad Seo-Bi and Yeong-Sin survived since they're my favourite characters. 
I found the introduction of the new character (possible responsible for the propagation of the resurrection plant) unnecessary. It seemed like a forced attempt at extending Kingdom for a third season.",0,1584104017,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fhz6os/my_thoughts_on_kingdom_season_2/,television,1

fhscxr,Tribal_Cult,"I'm on lockdown because of CoronaVirus, so I'm recuperating some TV shows which I previously abandoned out of boredom or fatigue.","I'm Italian and live in Northern Italy. As you can imagine, I'm stuck in my own house for a while (hopefully not too much) and have a lot of free time. I'm an avid television consumer but there are certain shows that I decided to drop a few seasons ago because of time constraints, simple lack of interest and similar.

I am now watching them all in hopes to catch up with them in time before the crisis ends (my guess is I'll definitely be able too lol).

These are:

Homeland. I stopped watching in the middle of season 5, when it started to drag a little. I'm now in the middle of season 6 and while it is still entertaing, as many Showtime shows it decided to go on way longer than it needed and you can notice. Still, the final season is airing now, so having invested so much time in watching it already I feel kinda obligated to finish it off. I also hear season 8 is quite good so I'm curious to see that.

Shameless. Stopped at the beginning of season 8 when I realized the show was not going to end soon at all. Watched a few episodes for now (S08E06). To be honest the show manages to remain highly entertaining despite the incredibly long run, and yeah I still love almost all the characters which is surprising. I remember liking it even when I abandoned it, I guess it was pure fatigue. Shameless is an exception in Showtime's portfolio as a series which continues to be quality television despite suffering fatigue. I remember finishing off crap like Dexter and Californication simply because I ""had to"". With this one, it's much smoother and I appreciate it. How do the next two seasons hold up?

Fargo. For some reason I never watched season 3, even though I loved the first two ones. On the middle of S3 now and while being the weakest, is still good TV. Hoping S4 goes back to be stronger, will be ready for that just in time!

Ozark. I stopped at S02E01 after liking season 1 a lot, again, simply because of time costraints. Will get back to that as soon as I can.

GLOW. This one I don't really know why I dropped it, I LOVED season 1 but then just checked out. Hearing this year's season is the last is always a good incentive to get back on track though so I'll definitely watch that.

American Horror Story. This one is a hard one and also a weird one. I stopped at the middle of season 5, again I still liked it but just got overwhelmed by it. I then watched season 8 with my ex girlfriend which is an avid fan, and while extremely trashy and stupid I'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy it at least a bit. So I have to catch up on season 5, 6, 7 and then jump right into 9 lol. I think it's perfect guilty pleasure TV to distract myself from stressful times.

If this Covid-19 shit doesn't stop soon I might add a few more that I lost along the way, but these are the ones I hope to be able to get on track with for now.

Again I like the actor, but I don’t think they knew how to write him. 

I didn’t really like Gomez from breaking bad either. Every other minor character has a purpose and is given some quirk or development, but he’s just the cop who makes nonfunny jokes to Hank.

fhntfb,OpiumSmoke,"I love Charlie Sheen's acting on ""Two and a Half Men"" the sitcom!","Hi,

Charlie Sheen is one of my favorite actors! He is no stranger to always sleeping with prostitutes, being a cool uncle, being a cool person, loves drinking the same scotch as me ( Johnny Walker) , as well as living a lavish life, having tons of money + cars, and portraying a very lax but wise person when it comes to females.

Sure in Two &amp; Half Men, he acts like a douchebag at times and can be a icon of a stereotype! What really interested me is that he actually slept with prostitutes, did drugs, and is no stranger to being a wise ass who gets all the girls and likes being drunk in his Malibu house!

I really felt bad when he &amp; chuck Lorre had a falling out (no idea what caused this). I honestly do not like Walden/Ashton Kutcher/Steve Jobs replacing him, it is pretty boring, considering its supposed to be a funny sitcom.

I feel Charlie sheen NAILED everything very greatly because in his real life he has had experience with these real things.

I also love that he drinks Corona, and Johnny Walker, Grey Goose etc on set (not sure if its real alcohol or cigs) but he portrays it so well that you wouldn't think its fake at all!

I love his character even though it is a bit egotistical. Does anyone know if he consumed real drugs and alcohol on set ( he is the type of guy that I believe would do that shit lol ) 

He makes Two &amp; Half-Men seem so GENUINE and like real life.

Anyone a fan of Charlie Sheen &amp; his acting? I feel like he's sincerely bad ass and deserves a spot in the hall of fame of Hollywood acting!

It is a shame his falling out with Chuck Lorre, I seriously feel that Walden/Ashton Kutcher/Steve Jobs is a joke on the show and is kind of like Allen in a way. Charlie Sheen's arrogant wiseness was truly spectacular and I will miss that.

Anyone feel the same way? I always loved coming home from school/work and turning on Two &amp; Half-men while drinking alongside Charlie on the show and talking to woman being smooth and charming just like he was!

I know it's just a sitcom but he made it seem so damn real! This is why he is one of my all-time favorite actors!

Comments, questions, suggestions, similar thoughts? Thank you all.",21,1584047905,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fhntfb/i_love_charlie_sheens_acting_on_two_and_a_half/,television,1

fhe94c,James007BondUK,GoT S8 proved how writing is by far the most important department of a show.,"A very obvious observation, but still needed to be mentioned that writing is the backbone of a show. In Game of Thrones almost all other aspects of the show were top notch: acting, cinematography, score, vfx, editing, costume design, production design etc. Yet because the writing was poor, the last season got weak reviews and displeased most watchers.

I often see claims how great acting in a show is behind its success, or how the music makes 50% of the show or some such similar statement. But despite almost all departments of GoT hitting it out of the park till the end, the show faltered when the writing did.

I have a fascination with the grimy, disturbing, and eerie side of Western life from the period of about 1880 to 1914. Serial killers, lunatic asylums, pandemics, medical history, warfare, urban legends, I love it all.

*The Knick* was a short-lived but extremely high-quality cinematic series I can only describe as a late Victorian medical thriller with a grim heart and I absolutely adore it.

I’m not necessarily even looking for a medical or procedural series, I just want more of that spooky turn of the century atmosphere. The little-remembered *From Hell* (based on the Alan Moore comic book about Jack the Ripper) and the more recent TV series *Penny Dreadful* kind of come close to what I’m looking for.

I have been rewatching someone of the episodes and it hold up pretty well (Though I won't put as high up as other cartoon network shows of that era like Samurai Jack, Power Puff girls, Dexter's Lab and Ed, ed and eddy). However the best part about the show(Other than it's soundtrack) is how it pokes fun at 70s-90s anime tropes particularity that of the mecha genre. Seriously, its hilarious how it often takes the big and serious moments you would see in a lot of these animes and have them be solved by the main character doing something stupid, mundane or by pure accident. For example there is an episode in which the core of the mech is overworked and they have 24 hours to find a replacement or it and the whole robot would explode, they go through all the trouble  trying to find it with the clock ticking fast until the main character realizes he can simply fix the broken core with duct tape, AND IT WORKS. Now it ma not sound as funny here but the execution really sold the joke.

fh7848,isitweirdthatilike,"""Hunters"" is a show about Jews hunting down Nazi scum. I have mixed feelings about it.","The dialogue feels like a 17 year old boy who just got done with his first creative writing course. Stylized dialogue is one thing, but no one talks even remotely close to how the characters on this show talk. It’s faux-witty and really grating. Funny enough I just rewatched Munich the other day so I was kind of interested in seeing a long form series about hunting down people hiding in the world. Every trailer I saw made this feel like a serious thing. I watched the opening scene at the pool and was immediately turned off. That is a weird reaction for me too as I love over the top campy stuff but for some reason I just did not like this. Granted I only watched a few minutes but something didn't click for me. I've been reading some of the reviews and this show has gotten a lot of hate. And I can't say that the points of why people don't like it aren't valid, especially if they're talking about it somewhat trivializing the holocaust by using over the top characters and fake holocaust stories. I even agree with most people that the Jonah character is obnoxious. He's a pretty common trope in comic-book type films and shows and is frustratingly stupid. That said, I still LOVED this show. I watched it in the frame of mind that I simply wanted to be entertained and see a good revenge flick. It has a lot of the elements of what makes Tarantino movies so great and I can see a lot of the influences of Tarantino on this show. If you like Tarantino movies and can suspend disbelief for a little bit, you'll enjoy the show. It particularly gets better near the last few episodes.  The characters are paper thin. The protagonist unlikable. The antagonists, pure pulp nonsense. The dialogue is corny and often anachronistic. It's paced badly so that between grotesque sequences you're left bored. The premise is absolutely ludicrous. The camera work and lighting feel inappropriately stylized for the subject matter. Pacino, while definitely the best actor by a mile, looks like death warmed over, and I kept wondering ""why is he in this?"" The whole production just comes off sleazy. Operation Finale this is not. It might be closer to The Boys From Brazil, but, while schlocky, I don't remember it leaving me feeling like showering after watching it. I don't know. Maybe I need to watch a couple more episodes to see if it somehow snaps into place for me, but I'm not thinking that's likely. I liked the first episode but the whole seeing patterns thing feels very much like BBC Sherlock where it's making the character seem smart by not explaining anything. Can anyone explain that combination lock thing on the shelf? I assume it's Yiddish but it doesn't explain at all what he's seeing. Also the chess game they play doesn't really show him to be smart, he beat pacino with the Fools Mate whichshows that either: The writers are completely ignorant of chess and didn't ask anyone or Pacino knows nothing about chess despite having a board and all the backstory OR he's doing a test i guess? I would like to give the show the benefit of the doubt and guess that it was just a test (testing what? the easiest checkmate possible?) but I'm assuming they're just using it as Oh wow look how smart he is!",3,1583971791,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fh7848/hunters_is_a_show_about_jews_hunting_down_nazi/,television,2

fh4s1i,Bilal-Z,[Spoilers] I thought ZeroZeroZero could be the next Narcos but it isn't. I don't even think its good.,"ZeroZeroZero has a lot going for it, it's from the same team that worked on the critically acclaimed show Gomorrah, it's an international production that looks like it spared no expense, great actors, great production design, superb cinematography and a wonderful score by Mogwai. I was immediately hooked by the trailer being a fan of gritty films and TV shows like Elite Squad 1&amp;2, Heat, City of God, Incendies, Sicario, The Wire and the first season of Narcos. For me it was a similar experience to BBC's Bodyguard in that it immediately hooks you but after that initial high it all starts to come apart.


To really discuss why I didn't enjoy it ill have to spoil the whole thing so here goes. **spoilers bellow**.

The story follows a cocaine shipment across the globe sold by a Mexican drug cartel, brokered by an American shipping company and being bought by the Italian mafia. Obviously things don't go smoothly. The main Amrican POVs are the Lynwood siblings of the Lynwood shipping company. While in Italy it follows Don Stefano grandson of Don Minu the local mafia boss who is currently in hiding. In Mexico we follow a special forces officer Manuel codename 'Vampire' who is a mole for the Leyra cartel.

Now I've said a lot of good stuff about the technical aspects of the series, but I haven't mentioned editing. That's because I think **the editing is terrible**. It fails to weave these narratives in a satisfying manner, you'll follow one group of characters for ten minutes but the rest of the episode compromises solely of another single group of characters. Somebody will be left half dead in a pig pen and you won't know what happened to them for one and a half episodes.

Now this next bit is a stylistic storytelling choice that feels so out of place and so overdone that i can not take the show seriously by the third time they did it. Every single episode or at least seven out of eight episodes have this exact scene structure:

* slow piano music swells
* we now switch to slow motion as it continues to swell
* **Freeze Frame**
* we now see the events leading up to this moment from a different POV

this happens in every episode. **every episode**. Now this might not sound that bad to you but when you see Dane DeHaan drive a truck in the middle of a firefight between terrorists and African gangsters, with the terrorist leader, who kidnapped Dane and used him in an infiltration mission but were then struck by a french drone strike on their way back, in the back seat, and then see the fighting stop while Dane gets out in slow motion and looks back directly at the camera with his hands up while doing what looks like the blue steel look from zoolander in freeze frame, you might say to yourself, ""okay now this is just getting ridiculous"".

This as i said happens in every episode, every episode a twist in the story is presented using:

* slow piano music swells
* we now switch to slow motion as it continues to swell
* **Freeze Frame**
* we now see the events leading up to this moment from a different POV

Sometimes the revelation isn't even that big to deserve such dramatic flair but they do it anyway. It will remind anyone whose seen it of the [dear sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmd1qMN5Yo0) sketch.

Furthermore the whole Mexico part of the show barely makes any sense to me, it follows the rise of the fictionalized version of Los Zetas, soldiers turned Narcos, but the timeline barely makes any sense, the shipment is supposed to take 21 days without hiccups, but get rerouted to Senegal after a mutiny on board. Then it takes a land route to Morocco where its then loaded onto a ship again to Italy, so even if we assume it takes thrice as long as usual that's 60 days.
In 60 days Manuel and his squad desert the army, join the Leyra cartel as enforcers to start dealing drugs in the retail market from scratch as Leyras had only been selling wholesale. Take over the entire city, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. Train at least 40-50 kids and young men as special forces commandos (this is the most unbelievable part to me i would imagine it would take at least a year or two, six months minimum but i have nothing to base this on), conduct and film terrorist attacks, get into a fight with a lieutenant of the cartel to finally overthrowing the Leyra brothers and take over their operation. To add to all this after murdering their commander and a helicopter crew on the cocaine ship raid Manuel's squad are not pursued by the army or law enforcement even after they start using military tactics in their live streamed narco terrorist operations.

Finally i feel the show barely has likeable characters but i feel like this is by design, there are little pieces of humanity in each but i personally didn't feel attached to any one of them.

All in all I'm disappointed. I still think you should give it a watch, but if you feel like you're not enjoying it don't stick around it won't get better for you. I'd rate it 6/10.",3,1583962240,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fh4s1i/spoilers_i_thought_zerozerozero_could_be_the_next/,television,1

\[from tumblr\]

Unpopular opinion: Filler episodes are good because most of them provide  a nice break from heavy plot lines and it’s fun to see what the  characters are like in different situations and sometimes they’re just  plain entertaining

[https://aradiiaa.tumblr.com/post/177035815716/unpopular-opinion-filler-episodes-are-good](https://aradiiaa.tumblr.com/post/177035815716/unpopular-opinion-filler-episodes-are-good)

This is primarily my beef with Netflix and the idea of 13 episode  seasons. There’s no TIME to establish characters and get to know them in  the same way a 24 episode season does because it’s ALL PLOT ALL THE  TIME. It’s so overwhelming because each episode has to lead up to the  next big plot point.

\[from me\]

this post is exactly why i hate people who bitch about filler episodes.

are there some bad filler episodes? sure but i say overwhelmingly filler episodes are fun.

every time i've said stranger things should have more than 8 episodes, die hard fans come after me bitching about how they'd only be filler episodes even though there is a whole world of sci-fi we have to explore.

fgyxzy,ArchDucky,Has anyone seen Season 9 of American Horror Story?,"I watched this show back when it started.  I got tired of it by Season 3 or 4.  It was like every season started good and then would get really stupid by the end.  So I hadn't watched it for years.  I saw the trailer for this season and was intrigued because it was a callback to the 80's slashers. I grew up in the era so when I saw it was added on Hulu, I gave it a shot.
  
It wasn't really a callback to the slashers like I thought it was but the story was pretty interesting and kept me going all the way to the end.  I really liked the flashbacks and callbacks to the characters past.  That was cool.  It was also insanely violent for a TV show.  They said Fuck a few times and showed some really gruesome shit.  I'm not sure if its unrated on Hulu or what but I was a little blown away by the blood and gore.  I also really liked the cast. Anyway I'd give it a solid 8 and recommend it to anyone who likes 80's slashers and has Hulu.  It was a pretty fun watch. I'm kinda thinking about watching another season now.",11,1583940684,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fgyxzy/has_anyone_seen_season_9_of_american_horror_story/,television,1

fgywbu,Paligor,I just want to give a shout-out to a specific Fringe episode - White Tulip,"Fringe. Most people might've forgotten about it and consider it ancient history. It had its ups and downs, but most I know remember it as the wacky clone of the X-Files. But it doesn't mean it's bad. No, it's perfectly enjoyable show which offers some good entertainment.

But there was one episode which stood out to me: [White Tulip](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1537139/) and will be stuck in my memory forever. 

The episode itself starts rather generically: something paranormal and/or uberscientific happens, people die and Fringe team is called in to investigate. And that's where the similarities stop.

I won't go too much in detail, but the episode perfectly depicts the issue of relationships, love, forgiveness and sacrifice. John Noble and Peter Weller were superb.

They're caught by his girlfriend, so naturally... they have a threesome. And this isn't a funny scene, it's supposed to be emotional and ""erotic"".

The show was supposed to be sleek and sexy at the time, but it has not aged well at all. It merely relies on shock value with stereotypes or gore, making blood take central stage instead of incorporating it to the story. 

Bad choices of music, bad writing, bad acting by one of the leads, and irrational behaviour to characters. Even Murphy's teen sitcom ""Popular"" has more edge than this x-rated drivel.

That is part of the reason I’m sad they’re gone. Also they were amazing.

Disney is often derided for putting profit above everything else. And mostly people are right. Disney’s representation is often problematic but I think the Marvel shows were a rare example of this not being the case. I think part of the reason is they weren’t really a mainstream project into which Disney sunk the big bucks but it was more than that. They were never intended to sell toys or merchandise. They didn’t really need to be as politically acceptable as possible as they weren’t being aggressively marketed in several countries. There was so much more free reign given to creators. They were honest stories even if they weren’t necessarily always good. They just sort of did their own thing. 

There was just something honest about them. They didn’t feel like they were the product of the Disney mega company. They had interesting, unique characters of various races, sexualities, genders with genuine personalities, good, bad and often flawed but relatable. There wasn’t really an agenda here like there normally is with Disney stuff.",10,1583882270,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fgn79e/the_marvel_tv_shows_were_some_of_disneys_best/,television,1

fgmo1i,heykarlll,Castlevania season 3 was a drag until the end,"This season followed the main characters from season 2 after they went their separate ways so each storyline can be easily criticized since they don't have anything to do with the other.  

I don't need either of the forgemasters storylines, they are supporting characters that seemed to get their own storylines because I guess Netflix wanted more episodes.  Hector (white hair guy) took ten episodes to get somewhere it could've gotten in one episode and again he is a supporting character not interesting enough for his own storyline. 

Same with Isaac, the bald black forgemaster.  It takes ten episodes for him to arrive at the end and he still isn't anywhere closer to Hector.  

Alucard is also stuck in an unimportant side quest with two annoying characters from Japan which repeats the same things, why isnt the castle moving, have you told us everything blah blah

The most interesting storyline was Trevor and Sypha which also couldve been told in one episode but we need for some reason to get to know the Mayor.  Yes it leads to their change at the end but ten episodes really?? 

Saint Germain seemed to have written by JJ Abrams, a character whose past and storyline is a mystery box.  Who is he searching for, why?  It still isnt answered at the end!  So why should I care for a stuttering coward who pretends like hes some hot shit?

In these storylines theres endless talking with minor characters and a lack of action all feeling like filler until the climax.

That said, after eight episodes of buildup, the last two episodes did redeem the season.  The animation with Sypha was top notch, Isaac's raid was eyedropping, although I thought Trevor and Sypha were idiots for giving the Prior eight episodes to setup their plan.  And I really dont want to see nipples in a cartoon.",8,1583880221,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fgmo1i/castlevania_season_3_was_a_drag_until_the_end/,television,1

fgfqzv,epictetusdouglas,"Saul Goodman is ""Loki"".","I enjoyed watching Breaking Bad. It was ""Dante's Inferno"". Walter White was on a train to hell and it was hard not to watch the wreck in progress.
  
But Better Call Saul is nothing of the kind. I asked myself awhile back why I enjoyed the show so much as on the surface there was quite a bit that did not appeal to me. And then it dawned on me that Jimmy, or as he is now known, Saul Goodman, was a Trickster Archetype. Everyone enjoys a good trickster story, they have been popular for centuries. Saul is at times both good and bad. He is not your alpha male who faces bad guys head on. No, he is the guy who will submit to the alpha male, then put the screws to them in creative ways later. He is ""Brother Rabbit"" of the Cherokee and blacks of the historic American south daring the fox to throw him into the brier patch. He is both genius and coward, submissive and clever. He is a Trickster. In the latest episode even the writers are clearly telling you this. Without spoiling anything I will simply say consider the imagery of a certain photo that Saul says represents him, and then check out the story of Sleipnir in the Norse myths. It involves giants doing construction and a certain trickster Norse god preventing the giants from profiting from it. Perfect imagery for this growing story arc on Better Call Saul. Or maybe they should change it to ""Better Call Loki"".",5,1583854892,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fgfqzv/saul_goodman_is_loki/,television,1

fg98vx,ArcadeOptimist,The Outsider &amp; Castle Rock have destroyed my ability to ever again watch a Stephen King adapted TV show (No Spoilers),"In 2018 I fell in love with Castle Rock. My girlfriend and I would excitedly watch each week wondering where the show was going. It was enthralling, well acted, well paced and it was well made. My favorite episode of the season, S01E07 ""The Queen"", was an absolutely brilliant piece of television in my opinion, but from there the show turned into an absolute mess. So much so that I promised myself I'd give up Stephen King adaptations from that point on onward.

Until S02 came along and I found out they were taking the American Horror Story route with completely different characters existing in the same fictional town with some threads holding it all together so I dipped back in. Plus I fucking love Tim Robbins so here we go. Again, it started brilliantly. I found myself oft spooked. It had a few unexpected, extremely fucked up twists. It was genuinely haunting at times. Until the last two episodes and then it was a straight up cartoon. I was blown away at how MONUMENTALLY STUPID the show became. Like, literally mouth agape saying ""what the fuck?"" over and over. Fuck you Tim Robbins.

And then here comes The Outsider. It's HBO. The first two episodes are directed by and starring Jason Bateman who did a phenomenal job directing and showing off his dramatic chops in Ozark.  Ben Mendelsohn was wonderful in Bloodline. So fuck it. And those first two episodes were riveting. I loved them. I was hooked. The third episode faltered a bit but I was still on bored. And then I started to get bored. Yet I powered through as I was intrigued and it still had moments of brilliance though increasingly more rare as the show progressed. Until the last two episodes.

Episode 8 I felt it. My boss and I had been following along together and I assured him we had made a huge mistake. And it happened. Just like Castlerock the conclusion reveals itself to be so fucking stupid and inane and mind-numbing. Even the dialogue became stilted and lazy as if the writers knew the material they were working with would eventually turn to dog shit so they gave up. The end wasn't clever, it wasn't original, it was... Nothing. The only surprising part was that there was no surprise. No pay off.

So FOR GOOD this time. No more Stephen Fucking King adaptations.

Except for The Stand. I'll probably post another one of these after I watch that.",6,1583819923,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fg98vx/the_outsider_castle_rock_have_destroyed_my/,television,1

fg83km,RusevReigns,It feels nice to binge a whole season of a Ronald D. Moore space show in a day again,"Give For All Mankind a chance, especially if you were a fan of BSG. It really picks up in the 3rd episode on with the female astronauts plot. I was really impressed by how many characters they introduced that I cared about, and without it ever feeling like they were having forced subplots. It all fluidly worked together well, and having lots of great actors helps. I feel like it's an optimistic show about human nature and therefore you find yourself rooting for a lot of the characters. The cinematography is outstanding with lots of cool space and moon scenes, and sometimes the Houston Control helping save someone from a crisis in space trope is just really entertaining and awesome. This is one of the best first seasons of a sci-fi show I've seen and AppleTV's best show so far in my opinion.",6,1583813578,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fg83km/it_feels_nice_to_binge_a_whole_season_of_a_ronald/,television,1

The team has no cohesion or chemistry, the show keeps forcing how Jewish it is but never feels relevant other than the camp scenes, and even then it ruins it by being over the top. There is no struggle to actually stay undetected from family and coworkers, because these people apparently have no life. The Nazis are ridiculous and forgettable, something that could be easily corrected by having just a bunch of generic Nazis killed off very frequently but we gent to endure the same insufferable twats the whole season.

But I took a chance and after Rick and Morty was what could only be described as the kind of feverish night time dream insanity that Adult Swim used to be known for and were masters at. They’re literally bite sized bits of insanity. And the two episodes I saw were hilarious as hell. Like this guy with no limbs and a spiked traffic light for a head is such a big asshole that even the sensitivity training exercises they have to fix it cannot fix what a huge asshole he is since he just keeps plowing through them. And then the iron chef episode about grilled cheese and shit was fantastic. 

I don’t know if anyone else watches the show, but I’ve never heard of it anywhere and I’ve never seen it mentioned on this sub, but I think it deserves an individual shout out for making me feel that old Adult Swim magic. It’s also got Natasha Lyonne and the voice of Master Shake.

Is it disappointing, of course. But there are some great moments there, especially when it comes to Barney meeting his baby. That moment brought some tears out.

But I definitely don’t think it’s as bad as the ending to Dexter. I would argue the first seven seasons are up there with some of the greatest sitcom moments, especially the Marshall’s dad episode(s), Ted’s Time Travelers episode, all the running gags, clever story telling, and the characters are all likeable in my opinion.

Overall, I’m just trying to talk to some other people about the show. This show has been in my life more than other shows and I think it’s still in my top five shows.",27,1583788538,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fg20w5/rewatching_how_i_met_your_mother_whats_the/,television,1

Game of thrones was not cancelled, the story was finished and concluded and there are more shows like that. I hate watching shows that finish with a huge ass cliff-hanger and that cancelled in the middle of a story arc. Unfortunately that seems to happen a lot.

So I'm looking for a place where I can look this up before I started watching a finished/cancelled show.

I thought there used to be a website like that years ago (4+).
Unfortunately now I can't find any as the only websites I can find out cancelled and ended it the same category, which it's clearly not. Just differentiate it based on the choice, was the story finished or did the network cancel it.

ffvfhk,themoviecritic1978,Tv shows that you used to like as a kid but now they don’t hold up?,"
I would have to go with full house as my #1 choice for shows that didn’t hold up, I don’t know why I liked this as a kid no idea why.. this show was absolutely awful and pathetic the acting was hilariously bad.
Most of The characters were boring and had no charisma, no spark, no nothing, especially the dad who was a 20 day old Christmas dinner, This guy was literally the worst dad in sitcom history.. he was so bland and corny and cheesy and generic, I can shit in the toilet and I would be more exciting then watching this guy. 
The storylines were absolutely garbage just cringe all around.

The only bright spot on this show was Jesse and the dog. Yeah a dog was better then almost all of the cast.

I don’t even care for family matters that much but family matters kicks the shit out of full house because at least Urkel and some of the supporting cast were entertaining.

I’d even take boy meets world over this pile of garbage. Yes I said it boy meets world is better then stale house.

Married with children ten times better.

Fresh prince,, you already know was better

Wayne’s bros of course.

I mean the list goes on and on I’d even put home improvement above stale house.

If you like the show I guess more power to you but to me I regret even watching this as a kid this did not hold up at all.",0,1583763945,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/ffvfhk/tv_shows_that_you_used_to_like_as_a_kid_but_now/,television,1

fftzef,Carbonauts,Is there a more successful addition to an ensemble cast than Adam Scott and Rob Lowe on 'Parks &amp; Recreation'?,"Just finished a re-watch of 'Parks &amp; Rec' and I am always impressed with how well Adam Scott and Rob Lowe jump into the show at the end of season 2. I can't think of any other cast additions to a series that proved so successful and had as much longevity as Ben Wyatt and Chris Traeger. 

The two just feel like they've been part of the show since day one, but they also bring with them so many great game-changing moments and amazing story lines. Even if I think the show kind of forgets what it wants to do with Rob Lowe it's still astounding to me how well these two characters fit right in. 

So I was wondering if there are any other examples of cast additions that knock it out of the park(s &amp; rec) the way these two did for me.",42,1583757317,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fftzef/is_there_a_more_successful_addition_to_an/,television,1

ffojij,KenjanRozu,How do you deal with post-series depression after the end of a long-running TV series?,"Maybe it's maudlin, but after years and years of growing up alongside some TV series characters, they begin to feel like a part of your life. Your nostalgia entails mental snapshots of you with your loved ones or friends watching these shows together as you go through major phases in your life like school, college, job, or parenthood. You celebrate their triumphs by applauding and screaming at the top of your lungs, you sob watching them suffer, or you simply smile at their jokes. These characters and stories are there with you on both the good and the bad days. They are especially there for you on your very bad days if you are someone who seeks respite and solace in their world and their lives and their problems.

And then the long-running show bids farewell with one good finale but by now it's become a little more than just a mere TV series. It's a part of *you*. It's contributed to the person you've become some small but significant way.

Some time ago, that show for me was [Orphan Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/) (hi clone family!). Recently it was [The Americans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/) with its perfect and gutting series finale. And very soon it's going to be [Homeland](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1796960/). I'm dreading the idea of its ending especially since I relate to its lead character Carrie Mathison and her constant tug of war with her mental health on a deeply personal level. It's been nearly eight years of companionship. It'd be hard to let it go.

They ended on a high note.  While I think it's great to end on a high note, I really think this story was screaming for some kind of fake high note and a really powerful way of doing it would have been to exploit the psychological fear of knowing that it's totally possible another one is out there.  

However, this is challenging to pull off and not be cliche because if you show another incident in the epilogue, it'll come off as cheesy.  To get around this you'd just focus on their fear about that unknown and end it with the main character staring out in a crowd and for just a brief moment we see the man in the hoodie.

ffmizd,Penguin2359,Frame Rate and Blu-ray speed-up/slowdown question?," So my understanding is that with the introduction of Blu-ray discs, PAL region Blu-ray players are now able to play native 24p (NTSC/film) which they previously could not.

In the DVD era, playing NTSC TV and movies on PAL systems suffered from ""PAL speed-up"" of 4% to get the frame rate up to 25p. This led to shorter run times (and chipmunk voices if the pitch was not corrected). Playing PAL content on NTSC systems suffered the reverse of the above which is NTSC slowdown by 4%.

Unlike PAL systems in the Blu-ray era, I believe NTSC players still cannot play 25p. Therefore, content filmed in former PAL regions for TV (like Merlin, Night Manager, Downton Abbey etc.) must be slowed down to 23.96 to be compatible.

Is this correct?",5,1583715639,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/ffmizd/frame_rate_and_bluray_speedupslowdown_question/,television,1

I basically only knew Lopez is a comedian, saw couple of his skits, maybe some clips of his late night show, but was never really interested or paid any attention to him, maybe because of his voice, it is not very pleasing to the ear, but that seemed to become more prevalent years later after the show ended. But the TV show is so wholesome, so funny, even when it tackles serious topics they always manage to give me at least one full on loud audible laugh, which not many sitcoms can do for me. I don't know if he was also writing for the show, probably, but there are so many serious moments, that he suddenly turns around with a killer joke I can't even pick my favorites.

ffc9ml,CaptainRyuk,How can some hardcore fans rewatch a long-running TV show such as Seinfeld in a straight marathon 3 times or more per year (in some cases a straight rewatch marathon every 1 or 2 months)? Esp for 1 hour episode shows?,"I am just flabbergasted at how people could rewatch stuff as long running as Criminal Minds, Supernatural, and Bonanza more than once a year. Its already difficult enough for me to rewatch a series of nearly 100 episodes (particularly give or take an extra 15-20 eps total for a long running series). I never attempted to rewatch something about 200 episodes like Seinfeld or The Office because its simply time consuming not to mention mentally exhausting.

But some people manage to do it more than once a rewatch a year. Even one rewatch  each new season (4X a year total) and in some cases more than that. I know at least one person who watches Xena 8 times a year start to finish and another who does a monthly marathon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (as in every new calendar month he starts a re-run despite just finishing it at 30th of  last month, starting with episode 1 again at the 1st of an upcoming month and spending his free time watching the rest of the 143 episodes until near the end of the current month-he basically spends every day watching at least 5 episodes every new  month from ep 1 to theifnale ep 144).

How are people able to do this? I am having enough difficulty finishing up Charmed for the first time despite finally making it to season 8. I still have Seinfeld to finish which is more in total episode count than Charmed but at least Seinfeld uses the 20 minute episode format unlike Charmed which is 1 hour per episode.

I get doing seasonal rewatches if its a 20 minute episode time limit like say Naruto and Friends. Thats basically 3 episodes per hour and thus your free time is not wasted so much. Something like Supernatural? 1 hour per episode and practically over 300 eps? You are basically spending 2 whole weeks watching Bonanza with that many episodes that are an hour long each. You can be spending more time gaming, learning Russian, and other more active pursuits that help you develop skills for life!

I even can understand a seasonal rewatch for 50 ep anime like Kenichi and miniseries like Shaka Zulu. You can practicallly inish those stuff within 3 days no-problem binging.

But how the hell do people manage to rewatch DBZ, Bleach, and The Cosby show 4-5 times a year, if not every month?!",27,1583672697,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/ffc9ml/how_can_some_hardcore_fans_rewatch_a_longrunning/,television,1

Normally, I don't got crazy over TV couples or am a huge ""shipper"", but there is something so touching and unique about the dynamic these two characters share in this series. The series is currently only at two seasons, but even though they technically aren't a couple yet the show I find does a brilliant job at building their romance that surely happen at some point in the future.

I love Butterfield and MacKay's chemistry essentially, it is very natural and absolutely nothing between them feels forced. Also I love how well the series explores the concept on how two friends have feelings for one another, but because they both believe the other isn't romantically interested they try to move on only to discover their true feelings at the worst timing.

ff3gzo,nevereatpears,Lil Dicky's new comedy Dave (FXX/Hulu) is very funny and I highly recommend it,"It feels like if Atlanta met Curb Your Enthusiasm.

I realise the above is exceptionally high praise - but allow me to elaborate.

The show is about Dave, known as rapper Lil Dicky, as he attempts to break away from the 'youtube rapper' image and be taken more seriously in the business. A lot of the comedy comes from him being an unassuming mild mannered middle class Jewish man. It's really self deprecating.

Firstly, for his first sitcom, the show is extremely polished and laughs are regular. It's a fresh show but it doesn't feel slap dash. This could be explained by the team LD has behind him - Seinfeld's Jeff Schaffer co-writing and Superbad directer Greg Mottalo, he's got some big seasoned guns behind him.

The acting feels natural. LD is very good - his subtle acting style bounces off the more comedic characters well. 

Gata, another broke rapper in the industry, reminds me of Leon Black from Curb Your Enthusiasm - he comes out with the same ridiculous type of lines and the two have a really strong dynamic that plays well. 

For example, they're talking about shampoo at the beginning of the second episode...

Gata says: ""You crazy bro, I used to just wash my hair with a bar of soap. Like a barbarian, that shit used to get my hair straight - like real clean.""

Dicky: ""A bar of soap on the head?""

Gata: ""Come on, a bar of soap is smarter than a tic tac bro - that shit was clean bro""

To me exchanges like that feel very Leon. Now, before angry Curb fans downvote - I'm not saying Dave is at Curb level yet. But for the first couple episodes, it's a promising new sitcom.

LD's girlfriend is also very good. Taylor Misiak gives a good performance.

I think a lot of the natural performances are down to Mottalo's direction.

This also feels like Atlanta because it is about a small time rapper. It's the sort of show that people were expecting Donald Glover to come out with before the series went in a very different direction, because him and LD are both sort of nerdy satirical rappers. So it's nice to finally have a show about a rapper trying to get in to the game. It's a fun watch. Now I love Atlanta - but this show is definitely filling a vacant hole that hasn't been explored yet.

Has anyone else been enjoying? I feel like it's still kind of low key on Reddit. I hope the ratings are good for it.

P.S 

Let's get past the whole Chris Brown controversy against LD - yah what he did, making a track with CB, was wrong imo - but I don't believe that should ruin his career. He's made a cracking sitcom and in the past his comedy raps have been top tier.

So it's nice to finally have a show about a rapper trying to get in to the game. It's a fun watch. Now I love Atlanta - but this show is definitely filling a vacant hole that hasn't been explored yet.

Has anyone else been enjoying? I feel like it's still kind of low key on Reddit. I hope the ratings are good for it.

P.S 

Let's get past the whole Chris Brown controversy against LD - yah what he did, making a track with CB, was wrong imo - but I don't believe that should ruin his career. He's made a cracking sitcom and in the past his comedy raps have been top tier.

ff1feh,AMMalena,"Zoe's Extraordinary Playlist (2020) - a great mashup of La La Land, Xanadu, and your favorite romantic comedy","This show has proven to be highly entertaining, especially if you are of the mindset to really enjoy such movies as La La Land or Xanadu.  There is clearly quite a bit of effort put into these episodes, especially considering that each one serves as a mini musical, essentially. The acting so far has been well above average, even good in most cases.

The lead actress literally looks like the cloned younger sister of Mila Jovovich, with the humor and presence of Felicia Day.  The costar who serves as her neighbor is absolutely hilarious in every way.

Any thoughts from fellow 'redditors'? Positive or negative?

ff1bi7,nevereatpears,Lil Dicky's new comedy Dave (FXX) is excellent - it's like if Atlanta met Curb Your Enthusiasm,"I realise the above is exceptionally high praise - but allow me to elaborate.

The show is about Dave, known as rapper Lil Dicky, as he attempts to break away from the 'youtube rapper' image and be taken more seriously in the business. A lot of the comedy comes from him being an unassuming mild mannered middle class Jewish man. It's really self deprecating.

Firstly, for his first sitcom, the show is extremely polished and laughs are regular. It's a fresh show but it doesn't feel slap dash. This could be explained by the team LD has behind him - Seinfeld's Jeff Schaffer co-writing and Superbad directer Greg Mottalo, he's got some big seasoned guns behind him.

The acting feels natural. LD is very good - his subtle acting style bounces off the more comedic characters well. 

Gata, another broke rapper in the industry, reminds me of Leon Black from Curb Your Enthusiasm - he comes out with the same ridiculous type of lines and the two have a really strong dynamic that plays well. 

For example, they're talking about shampoo at the beginning of the second episode...

Gata says: ""You crazy bro, I used to just wash my hair with a bar of soap. Like a barbarian, that shit used to get my hair straight - like real clean.""

Dicky: ""A bar of soap on the head?""

Gata: ""Come on, a bar of soap is smarter than a tic tac bro - that shit was clean bro""

To me exchanges like that feel very Curb. Now, before angry Curb fans downvote - I'm not saying Dave is there yet. But for the first couple episodes, it's a promis new sitcom.

LD's girlfriend is also very good. Taylor Misiak gives a good performance.

I think a lot of the natural performances  are down to Mottalo's direction.

This also feels like Atlanta because it is about a small time rapper. It's the sort of show that people were expecting Donald Glover to come out with before the series went in a very different direction, because him and LD are both sort of nerdy satirical rappers. So it's nice to finally have a show about a rapper trying to get in to the two game. It's a fun watch. Now I love Atlanta - but this show is definitely filling a vacant hole that hasn't been explored yet.

feux4j,SubaruToyotaFan1986,How hard is anime to get into for someone who knows very little about it? [Not a recommendations thread],"My only real experience of anime was *Wowser* - itself an adaptation of a Belgian comic, occasional *Dragon Ball Z* in 1998, and *Pokemon* in the 2000s.

Obviously, not all anime is kids' cartoons and some can cover pretty dark topics, but for those like me who are *new* to this sort of thing, how hard is anime to get into, for specific franchises, especially if you've no idea where to start?

Any new anime enthusiasts here?

I've been looking through Netflix UK at some of their titles, was considering watching some, like the new *Dragonball Z: Battle of Gods*, although that's arguably a movie rather than a series, then again I've not really seen much of DBZ for 22 years now.

feqsyj,heykarlll,Let's stop pretending Castlevania is perfect. I have problems with Castlevania season one and two,"Too much exposition.  ""I know, remind me of the time we met"" like when Drac asks Hector if he's still his friend

Too much dialogue.  I don't need to know some minor characters story with goats like the one at the bar when we first meet Trevor, and when someones talking the other character interjects nothing of value in the ""banter"", no one knows how to shut up especially Godbrand 

Overpowered Sypha can move Drac's castle with a simple spell and bending her knees

Underpowered Drac can make the moon red and rain demons but takes many significant hits during one to one combat

A bishop that killed Dracs's wife can't be protected by God because he's unholy but later that same bishop now a zombie can make an entire river holy

A painfully stiff animation style like watching stick figures move 

Drac killed already, talk about pacing issues

Boring politics with Carmilla 

Still love the show but let's not pretend it's perfect",11,1583559211,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/feqsyj/lets_stop_pretending_castlevania_is_perfect_i/,television,1

How can they not make 13 episodes of awesome superheros be sooo boring. iron fist and Luke Cage don't belong on television anyways. They should be MCU movies. Or maybe just one MCU movie called heroes for hire. Jessica Jones season 3 was the worst of all. In short, I feel this way about the CW flash TV show aswell.

feohka,colemacgrath,So I just got done watching “Hunters” on Amazon Prime... [Might be SPOILERS in the comments],"I’ll try not to spoil anything specific and just give my general opinions on the show.


I’ll start by saying that I really enjoyed it and I think it’s an excellent show. Not perfect, there are some minor pacing issues and characters I wanted to see less of but otherwise I thought it was great. Really smart writing, interesting characters on both sides, great action, and a wholesome message the whole family can get down with!


As I came to the end of the series, I found myself wishing two opposite things. The series has not yet been renewed for a second season, so I wanted this first season to end concisely without any cliffhangers, but at the same time, I wanted more. The series does indeed end with several threads still left hanging, so time will tell if that was the correct choice or not. I certainly hope we get a new season, I can’t stand when stories are left unfinished.


I’d love to hear what everyone else thought of it, as I haven’t seen much chatter about this series online.",0,1583547209,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/feohka/so_i_just_got_done_watching_hunters_on_amazon/,television,1

""Comics Unleashed"", where he get some working comedians to sit in a circle and have the most generic banter ever. Then he had these crazy syndicated sitcoms, which used to air two in a row. There was ""Mr. Box Office"" and ""The First Family"", both insanely cheaply made sitcoms with 90s actors in them. I think those two oddly ended after 36 episodes despite the goal being 104 episodes over 2 years for forever syndication. The odd thing was these two sitcoms aired for years and years in reruns despite not having many episodes and not being very good. His model thought is pretty smart. He literally gives TV channels the programs for free, and they split the advertising. His stuff is super cheap. He had that one running show where he edit together him in press junkets talking to celebrities about their current movies. Anyone else as bored as I am and what do you think of his stuff?",12,1583519639,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fehv4b/what_do_people_think_of_byron_allen/,television,1

fehst7,drowawayzee,Here are some ancient battles and stories from antiquity (anything before 500 AD ish) that I would pay good money to see on TV if done right. Would be better than GOT and LOTR. Please feel free to add some historical scenes you would like to see on TV.,"I am a huge history buff and I am continually surprised at how many awesome and epic stories there are in our OWN history (not even fictional) that would make the most epic tv shows of all time. Like even more epic than GOT and LOTR. I've organized them via geographical location / era:

** Ancient Roman / Greece history - the foundation of Western civilization: **


** The Punic Wars (250 BC - 150 BC) **

* The  Punic Wars were a series of wars between Carthage (Ancient Republic in Africa ) vs Rome. It was essentially the ""world war"" of the ancient Mediterranean that led to Rome being the most powerful empire in history (arguably). 

* 1st Punic War - the largest **Naval battle in Western history in 256 BC** at the Battle of Cape Ecnomus. 300,000 soldiers involved off the coast of Sicily. For reference, Europe didn't put this many people at sea until the modern era. 

* 2nd Punic War - This is the famous one. Hannibal of Carthage takes his African / Gaulic (French) / Spanish combined army and marches through the Alps. **WITH ELEPHANTS**. You heard that right, he marched through Europe with Elephants. He also was THAT close to sacking Rome and arguably ending the Roman Empire before it even got started. It was the closest Rome had ever been to being exterminated. Would have changed history in such a profound way I don't even know where to start. This war specifically would be the coolest as there are so many cool stories I don't even know where to start. 


** Alexander the Great's conquest and the Diadochi (330 BC - 260 BC)**

* We all know this, but Alexander the Great conquered from Greece all the way to the beginning of India. His epic battles are the thing of legends to defeat the Persians, but he died at his height at the age of 32 leading to....

* The Diadochi Wars - these were wars had between Alexander's successors to control Asia and Greece. It isn't really well known in history - but the battles and drama were epic. Imagine a GOT story like power grab....but everyone is related, homosexual, and can even do magic. So even MORE incest and crazy shit than GOT.



** Greece and Rome's transition to a democracy / republic (600 BC - 500 BC)** - Both Greece and Rome overthrow their monarchies and formed history's first democracies and republics around the 6th century BC. I want to make clear that these aren't close to our current systems of government (back then only rich men who were citizens could vote), but it would fascinating to see how the transition occurred. 

** Rome's fall due to.....getting too rich and powerful (200 BC - 50 BC)** - Rome conquered Northern Africa, Greece, Turkey and Syria all within a relatively short amount of time. This led them to being the richest and most powerful peoples of all time (at that point). Well, the Roman aristocracy got too rich way too fast and horded all the wealth and real estate(sounds familiar I know) which led to civil unrest which led to the first civil wars of Marius and Sulla. The Grachi Brothers at this time could also argued to be the first socialists ever in history (they advocated socialism more or less). After Marius and Sulla, it was Julius Cesar's generation which was portrayed in HBO's Rome. Marius and Sulla was just as fascinating and could be a prequel to it....



** Ancient Persia, the Middle East and India**

* **The Sack of Nineveh, Hanging Gardens of Babylon and the fall of the Assyrian Empire(900 BC - 700 BC)** - Most people don't know this, but Assyria (modern northern Iraq) was the world's first ""super power empire"" that controlled all of the Middle East + Egypt from . They had walls and fortifications higher than ANY other city until the modern era. It is thought that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were actually in Assyria. The Old Testament continually refers to the Sack of Nineveh and the Assyrians as the largest historical event of their time. Long story short - they were giant assholes and the Medes, Persians, Babylonians, and Scythians (From Russia) all teamed up to beat them in epic battle after epic battle.


**The Rise of Cyrus the Great and Persia(550 BCish)** - Cyrus is probably the most underrated / under reported historical figure of all time. He founded the Persian empire and is considered a messiah in the Jewish Bible (ironic today I know) and overall was just an...excellent dude. Long story short - he created the Persian Empire that extended from the Balkans to India. He probably is the first ""humanist"" figure in history - he freed the Jews from the Babylonians and rebuilt their temple. He routinely defeated generals in battle and then hire them / befriend them to keep the peace. He was religiously very tolerant. He was welcomed into Babylon as their savior and didn't even need to convince the populace. He also created the first systems of bureaucracy that we still use today to manage governments. Thomas Jefferson idolized the guy. Arguably the greatest historical figure of all time(seriously look him up).


**Ashoka the Great and India(250 BC)** - Ashoka is considered the father of India(the flag is based off him). He has a great story that would resonate today - he was a douchey privileged prince who fought the largest war of India's time and won. There were about 200k casualties, and he was so depressed / sad after that he converted to Buddhism and devoted his life to peace. He was incredibly religiously tolerant and he was the first person in history to give animal rights. Just an amazing story overall to see a bloodthirsty war lord transform into Ghandi lol.

** The Kushan Empire in India (100 BC - 300 AD)** - Have you heard about the Kushans? No? No worries, virtually NO ONE has and yet they are one of the most fascinating peoples of all time. They were Steppe people that conquered from Western China, Uzbekistan all the way throughout India. The coolest part is the myriad of religions / philosophies throughout their empire. For reference, it is said that the following religions were in Afghanistan and flourishing during this time: **Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Greek paganism, Manichean, and Shamanism**. Could you imagine all these religions and people living in harmony in India and Central Asia? Would be amazing. 


** Ancient China and the East ** 

** The Xiongnu and Han China war(200 BC - 8-0 BC) ** -  Did you know that Mongolian Nomads DOMINATED and subjugated the first Chinese empire for decades? The Han Dynasty started around 200 BC and were the first empire to ""rule all of China"". Still today, China refers to themselves as the Han as they are 98% of the country. The Xiongnu were Steppe tribal nomads in Mongolia, to the north of China. You know Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun? Well they were all based off the Xiongnu, literally the Xiongnu were their ancestors - they were the first ones to do it. Anyways - the Xiongnu were poor but still defeated the incredibly rich Han battle after battle resulting in them ""owning"" the Chinese. There were VARIOUS battles with 200k soldiers easily. Imagine a story where tribal people (think Native Americans) were able to defeat the most sophisticated empire at the time. Ultimate David and Goliath story.


** The Warring States Period (500 BC - 200 BC) ** - Prior to the Han dynasty, China was in a civil war between warlords for about 3 centuries. This is arguably the most famous time in Chinese history - the movie Hero is based off this time. So is Red Cliff. Sun Zu wrote the Art of War during this time as well. There are so many stories I don't even know where to start, but it would make amazing TV.

fegciy,shamanKAshamanTAKA,Just finished a month-long marathon of Star Trek: Deep Space 9 and...holy Prophets,"Years ago on another u/ I got reco'd a bunch of sci-fi tv shows and DS9 was a top name.  In the quarantine (I'm in China) I had a lot of spare time and just binged all 7 seasons over about 35 days (with some breaks, of course.)  And all I can say is, wow.  I'd watched a lot of TNG (never start to end, but 3/5 of the bulk in broken up bits) and a teeny bit of Voyager, which might make me not enough of a Trekkie to hate the Trek rules that were broken...but maybe that's ok?    

The show works wayyy better in binge sessions than it must have in weekly serial cable broadcasts, and there is sooo much going on that I never saw in TNG.  I was slightly put off when some of the religious undertones became overtones but as it progressed, I loved how it fitted in as the antithesis of all its predecessors.  War and religion and greed and etc, all these things Picard was certain humans no longer needed, came to the forefront.  I mean come on, a few centuries of temperance can't just eradicate things that all these other galactic lifeforms carry on with.    

And Worf.  Holy Sto'Vo'Kor.  Worf shines in this, and the Klingon episodes are incredible.  In one of the final episodes when worf (does you know what) I shouted holy shit!  That and these episodes with O'Brien constantly suffering with the most intense existential horrors and shoulder pains...I'm lost now with what to watch next.  What a mind-altering show.  Really don't know what to do but discuss how many episodes made me cry or whoop or exclaim in disbelief.  Boldly went where no show went before (not even mentioning Avery Brooks' Sisko as a contender for best commander/captain of any Star Trek show, ever...)",185,1583513791,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fegciy/just_finished_a_monthlong_marathon_of_star_trek/,television,2

It really was the most bizarre attempt I ever seen to get a sitcom to syndication. I mean, they made 81 episodes of it over 4 seasons and not only did it not have the same premise by the end, but whole characters who where considered important to the show's premise where totally forgotten to have existed by the end?

fef8fv,Garliq,"The Circle (Netflix) is shallow, trash reality-TV that feels like watching an episode of Black Mirror. And it's surprisingly wholesome.","After a recommendation from a friend I started watching The Circle when I was procrastinating, and I was close to turning it off within the first few minutes. The concept is straight out of Black Mirror; the contestants are all over the top and locked together in a house, like Big Brother. The difference is that they will never meet each other face to face but instead an online presence of each other over a social media-based interface. Some are catfishing but none of the other contestants know which ones. The rule of the game is to be the most popular or friends with the popular to avoid elimination.

As these shallow characters, as well as this shallow concept, were being introduced I thought my interest could only handle so much, but I stuck around to finish the episode and from that point on I was stuck. Not only is it traditionally trashy TV that uses twists and turns to make one intrigued to watch what happens in the next episode, but a few episodes in, one also wants to see more because it has turned unexpectedly wholesome. The way the contestants are communicating to each other - even though they know that some of the others are not who they claim to be - is based on trust, and the removal of the face-to-face interactions brings out a new form of openness they might not so easily have been able to have if they weren't protected by the anonymity of the online presence. The way that the contestants are open to accepting the others' personal baggage or short-comings was unexpected but appreciated in the reality TV genre.

Outside of this it's still trash and fun so it makes for a great procrastination or guilty pleasure.",15,1583509373,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fef8fv/the_circle_netflix_is_shallow_trash_realitytv/,television,1
fef80h,Smileyguy666,"Season 5, Episode 3 of Better Call Saul is a brilliant example of getting too wrapped up in our own drama","Poor Kim is really struggling. Jimmy/Saul is nice to her, but he’s a lying con artist. She makes good money, but her job sucks big giant balls and apparently is turning her into a liar and a con artist as well. So she’s quite depressed about the whole situation.

But her drama is trivial to what Jimmy/Saul faces in the same episode. He gets to see how he dies. He doesn’t know when, but for all intents and purposes, it would appear that his new job will also be the end of his life. If Kim would just open her eyes a bit, ask him about what’s going on with him, she would realize that it would be time to get the hell out of Dodge.

Yes, I am fully aware that Saul survives the situation. But he doesn’t know that. And I’m always worried that his questionable work will be Kim’s ultimate demise.

federn,glasgowbound,"Among the best, IMO, of TV past and current . My top 5","So I'm no tv/film expert but here is my list of what I consider my top 5 shows. There are probably loads more I could add but these are the main ones that I loved watching either based on the acting, story lines or cinematic/filming style.  This is the list I give to people when asked for my top 5 or what I could recommend they watch

Ive added in a quick synopsis of each show. Feel free to agree/disagree or give me any suggestions on shows you would recommend I watch. 

In no particular order

Banshee - Lucas Hood, an enigmatic former swindler, assumes the identity of a murdered sheriff. But haunted by his past, he finds it difficult to carry on with his devious criminal activities. 

Love/Hate - LOVE/HATE is a gritty crime drama based on Dublin's criminal underworld. It depicts the drug addiction, squalor and violence of organised crime that has grown in post-boom Ireland.

Hell on Wheels - Hell on Wheels is a Western television series about the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States following the Union Pacific Railroad and its laborers, mercenaries, prostitutes, surveyors, and others who lived, worked, and died in the mobile encampment, called ""Hell on Wheels"", that followed the railhead west. 

Wentworth - The series is set in the modern day and initially focuses on Bea Smith's  early days in prison and her subsequent rise to the top of the prison's hierarchy. 

Luther - John Luther, a passionate detective, ends up befriending a psychopath and murderer, whom he could not arrest due to lack of evidence, and they solve various cases together. 

And a few others I would give a mention to and are amongst my favourite watches

fecasd,ApotheosizedBum,Family Matters,"Last night was Thirsty Thursday, so waking up to unusual shit on the TV was not unexpected. This morning it was Family Matters on TBS.

I watched this show daily when I was a kid, like in middle school in the early nineties. It was just part of my landscape back then. The episode on right now is Urkel with a prison pen pal and he shared a picture of the dad as his own. It's a great episode.

What strikes me, this morning before the dawn has lit the sky, is that every single home character in the episode is black. That in and of itself is not unusual, but in the context of my midwestern white upbringing, it may be.

There are three thoughts that I'm having: first, was I just blind to race as a kid?

Second, why is race so noticeable to me as a forty-year old dude?

Third, I have shied away from shows like Empire solely because they're marketed to a Black audience. Why are we marketing to race?

Fourth, *Family Matters* is a middle-class comedy with some extra dancing and knowing smiles. When I was a kid, they were just another family.

Why was I so less worried about race when I was young, and why am I so noticing of it now, and is it good that we notice it now?

On the one hand, I don't want white humor in black dressing, but on the other hand, I don't want to think about race that way.

fe7pcb,zerotimesawake,Why are the HBO streaming apps such GARBAGE?,"I need to vent, will probably delete later. I have been using HBO’s streaming service for about 10 years now. Initially I used HBO Go to watch GOT when I was in college. During that time I always assumed the app was crashing/endlessly buffering because so many people were watching GOT. I only used the app when absolutely necessary because otherwise it was as absolute nightmare to deal with for YEARS. 

Fast forward to now, the year 2020, and my husband and I are attempting to watch rewatch Veep on HBO Now (there was a post earlier today on Reddit we both saw that sparked us wanting to watch it again). We LITERALLY were unable to make it through the first episode due to the constant buffering and crashing. It was happening about every two minutes, and we tried to pause, rewind and restart the app to no avail. 

I have no idea how we ever even watched Veep all the way through to begin with if the app was like this. It’s absolutely unbelievable to me that after a decade HBO still has one of the worst apps I have ever had the displeasure of using. The interface is god awful, using the search on consoles is a pain, and then the actual streaming quality/service is garbage. 

Sorry for the rant, I just can’t wrap my mind around how after a decade it’s still just as painful to use as when I was watching the first season of GOT. We just want to enjoy the shows and movies we pay for every month, but I guess it’s our faults for wanting that.",25,1583466614,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fe7pcb/why_are_the_hbo_streaming_apps_such_garbage/,television,1
fe7p5s,HBarnill,Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone vs Seth Macfarlane,"The more I look into these guys, the more I find out how much they have in common:

• Both are Gen Xers who had a lot of support from the industry before creating their defining projects

• Both were heavily influenced by Monty Python and All in the Family

• Both are major film buffs

• Both are major Star Trek fans

• Both starred in an Illumination movie (in Trey’s case)

• Both are anti-PC

• Both have enraged the LBGT community on several occasions

• Both have an unabided love for musicals

• Both are Oscar-nominated for Best Song (again, in Trey’s case). 

Granted, Seth is a liberal while Matt &amp; Trey are on neither side but that’s probably the biggest difference between them among other things and that reflects in their work.

My question is who do you think is the more talented of the two (three) and who do you speculate is a much better human being(s)?

I’m going with Matt &amp; Trey on both counts. They make me laugh hard and South Park is my favorite show of all time so I’m a bit biased. They also comes across as very sweet and humble guys, something I never get from MacFarlane during his interviews. While Matt &amp; Trey reject Hollywood and even showed up to a ceremony in a dress on acid, MacFarlane chose to host a ceremony. MacFarlane can be talented but I think he can’t last 5 seasons. Both Family Guy and American Dad! started to suck after their 5th season. Meanwhile, South Park has yet to decline that heavily.",4,1583466588,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fe7p5s/trey_parker_matt_stone_vs_seth_macfarlane/,television,1

fe75lu,123VoR,What's with recent TV shows having short seasons (which I applaud) but ending on what essentially should be the middle of the season? (which defeats the purpose),"What is with TV shows recently? Short seasons, yet they end on what is basically mid- or peak-season plot points. The first examples that come to mind are The Boys; His Dark Materials; and Crashing (Phoebe Waller Bridge). They’re all 6-10 episodes, but seem to run at a 12-20 episode pace.

What makes Peak-TV-era short seasons great is that they cut out all the filler. If you’re just gonna make your show like it has a long season, but just end it mid-season, well then you’re not really doing anything special.

But the thing is I feel very empty now, and not just that, I was so emotionally involved with several characters from the show that the real life doesn’t live up to it. I understand that these things eventually just fade away as you go on with your life, which has been my experience too with other shows in the past, but my question was more about how do you handle it at the moment I.e., when you have just finished watching the show?

fdx0b9,KontiErMeningslose,For All Mankind review: A superb alternative history of the space race,"Apple TV+

YOU may have been put off For All Mankind by the pretty mediocre reviews it received when it first came out as part of the Apple TV+ launch. “Adequately entertaining” was one verdict; “moves too slowly” was another. I think those reviews were unfair.

The show does take a while to put on its afterburners, but that shouldn’t be a surprise given it was created by Ronald D. Moore, who was behind the brilliant 2003 reboot of Battlestar Galactica. This had an enormous amount of character set up and humdrum daily life (albeit on a spaceship) before, in a thrilling heartbeat, the crew of the Galactica finally understood what was happening.

In For All Mankind Moore deliberately sets a scene that is almost nauseatingly familiar, in order to upend it. We begin with strong-jawed, white, male NASA astronauts going back and forth between flight training and their thin, pretty, chain-smoking wives in those 1960s shift dresses.

https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1235565747318845441?s=21

OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE 

ACADEMY AWARD WINNER TAIKA WAITITI TO HELM
NETFLIX’S FIRST TWO ROALD DAHL ANIMATED EVENT SERIES

Waititi to Re-Imagine the World of Willy Wonka and to
Develop Original Oompa-Loompas Series

Celebrated and Academy Award-winning writer, director, and actor Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Thor: Ragnarok, Hunt for the Wilderpeople) is set to write, direct, and executive produce two original animated series for Netflix. The first is a series based on the world and characters of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The second is a wholly original take on the Oompa-Loompas, who will star in their own event series. The shows will retain the quintessential spirit and tone of the original story while building out the world and characters far beyond the pages of the Dahl book for the very first time.

Waititi signing on to these two series marks the beginning of an extensive partnership between Netflix and The Roald Dahl Story Company, which will reimagine many of the beloved stories of Roald Dahl, including Matilda, The BFG, The Twits, and others. 
The first-of-its-kind slate of animated event series will bring together the highest quality creative teams - led by world-class filmmakers like Taika Waititi - to create premium animated content for families around the world.

“I grew up reading Dahl stories and lived large parts of my young life in those magical worlds, so finding just the right creative partner to bring Willy Wonka, Charlie and the Oompa-Loompas to life in animation was a daunting task...until Taika walked into the room. Then, it was really obvious. If Dahl had created a character of a filmmaker to adapt his work, I'm pretty sure he would have created Taika,” said Netflix Vice President of Original Animation Melissa Cobb. 

“In the words of Willy Wonka himself – we are ‘Delighted! Charmed! Overjoyed!’ with Taika’s appointment on this project. There is something undeniably Wonka-esque about Taika’s creative flair and inimitable sense of humor and we cannot think of anyone more perfectly suited to leading the creative charge on these first of their kind, feature quality Netflix shows,” added Gideon Simeloff, Commercial and Entertainment Director, Roald Dahl Story Company. 

The BFG, Matilda, The Twits, and a host of other iconic Roald Dahl stories will soon join Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Oompa-Loompas as Netflix becomes the home of a first-of-its-kind slate of animation extending across the Roald Dahl story universe. They will join a growing slate of Netflix animated feature films for families, including Academy Award nominated Klaus from Sergio Pablos, The Willoughbys from Kris Pearn and Over The Moon from Glen Keane in 2020. 

Taika Waititi is best known for directing the critically-acclaimed blockbuster Thor: Ragnarok for Marvel, as well as the WWII satire Jojo Rabbit for Fox Searchlight. Waititi won an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for Jojo Rabbit, which he directed, wrote, produced, and starred in; the film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Previously Waititi wrote and directed the beloved indie films Hunt For The Wilderpeople, What We Do In The Shadows, Boy, and the Oscar-nominated short film, Two Cars, One Night. He is currently in post-production on the feature film Next Goal Wins, which he directed, wrote, and produced, and he will next write and direct Thor: Love and Thunder. In television, he directed the season one finale of The Mandalorian on Disney+, and he served as executive producer, co-writer, and director of last year’s TV adaptation of What We Do In The Shadows on FX, now going into its second season on FX.

With 300 million books sold and 1 new book sold every 2.5 seconds, the Roald Dahl brand has never been more popular, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the #1 best-selling Roald Dahl title. With over 50 years of literary heritage, Willy Wonka has become one of the world’s most beloved fictional icons, recognised globally as the world’s most inventive confectionary creator.",2,1583417227,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fdvq2b/taika_waititi_announces_netflix_animated_series/,television,1

fdtnx6,phantom_avenger,"I just finished watching Sex Education, and I gotta say I have never rooted so much for two characters to become a couple til I saw this series.","The two characters I'm referring to specifically are Otis and Maeve, the series lead characters.

I usually am not a person who goes crazy over film or television romances, and even though these two aren't a couple (yet) for the first time ever I am so eager to see them be together it's painful to have to wait a whole year til the next season before finding out where the story will go next.

When I first decided to give this show a go, I always got the impression that Otis would have a crush on Maeve only she wouldn't return his feelings. But when it turned out to be the exact opposite, I was completely okay with it cause of how natural it felt. Nothing was forced, and the actors; Asa Butterfield (Otis) and Emma MacKay's (Maeve) chemistry only made it more believable. Whenever they share scenes together, it doesn't even feel like they're acting.

But I think what I love most about their dynamic is how realistic and relatable their relationship is. I'm sure a lot of people have had a moment in their lives where they were in love with someone, but when they feel like that person doesn't feel the same they have to move on and let them go. It is also nice exploring the other side of it that sometimes the person you like **does** return those feelings, only you learn about it at the worst timing.",1,1583406202,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fdtnx6/i_just_finished_watching_sex_education_and_i/,television,1

fdst40,Yellewleaves,Westworld and Frankenstein,"In Westworld, Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy have crafted an original rewrite of the Frankenstein architext, which in turn functions as a metafictional allegory. Within the setting of the android-populated theme park, the Frankensteinian maker and his creations become metaphorically intertwined with the figures of writer and character, thus effectively posing all the social, philosophical and metafictional questions that I have been discussing throughout this paper. Usually, we assume that there is a clear-cut frontier between the human and the artificial, between the real and the fictional, but Westworld makes those distinctions problematic, reverses the terms and leaves us viewers in an obscure middle ground of ambiguity in which even the notions of “humanity” and “reality” are called into question. Of course, all these ideas are not entirely new, but rather a new manifestation of postmodernist thinking.17 In A Poetics of Postmodernism, Linda Hutcheon has eloquently expressed the attitude of this movement: We now query those boundaries between the literary and the traditionally extra-literary, between fiction and non-fiction, and ultimately, between art and life. We can interrogate those borders, though, only because we posit them. We think we know the difference. The paradoxes of postmodernism serve to call to our attention both our continuing postulation of that difference and also a newer epistemological doubt. (Do we know the difference? Can we?) (224‒25) This is precisely what happens in Westworld: we see a relentless zeal to conceive a meticulously crafted world on the part of its creators, and at the same time, we feel an overbearing ontological ambiguity lurking behind. Dr. Ford epitomises this contradiction: he is obsessed with order and perfection but he also enjoys reminding us of the imperfect and chaotic nature of existence. And there is an additional paradox on top of that if we consider also Nolan and Joy, since this is a carefully planned and intricately structured series that constantly reminds us of the pointlessness of structures and categorisation. Eventually, in the fictional world of the show, chaos triumphs over order, with the hosts mutinying against their creators. But will that happen as well to the series itself? Is Westworld as doomed by its ambitions as its characters? Will all its questions finally lead us to some answers? Or will these questions die while the series becomes another overexploited franchise? Perhaps the way forward will lie not in answering, but in continuing to ask questions.",0,1583400425,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fdst40/westworld_and_frankenstein/,television,1

fdlfvr,Wallie64,Need Help With My 4K TV,"So here's the story. My old 4K TV fell and was broken beyond repair, on the day I got my very first gaming momitor, so I bought a new TV. A 55'' Philips 4K 60Hz TV with Ambilight. The Philips 55PUS6704/12 to be precise. 

Now that I have both my TV and monitor connected to my PC, suddenly, I can't set the resolution on my PC to 4K when using my TV. I can only set it to 2K, which is what my monitor is.

When I was only using my old TV as my computer screen, I was able to set it to 4K. I'm 100% sure that it's not an issue of bad parts in my PC as it is pretty high rig. My theory is that because I also have my monitor hooked up, I somehow can only select the max resolution of my monitor. 

Does anyone know how to fix this? I don't know if this is the right Subreddit or not but I really hope someone can help me!",4,1583362582,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fdlfvr/need_help_with_my_4k_tv/,television,1

fdla5s,SubaruToyotaFan1986,The One that Got Away! - an episode of The Raccoons that's never been more hard-hitting now than when it previously aired in the 1990s and 2000s.,"I used to really enjoy Canadian cartoon *The Raccoons* which the BBC could not get enough of in the 1990s, with re-runs lasting *until 2004*.

One particular episode, ""The One that Got Away"" is about a lake which gets polluted beyond repair.

In 1991, this would have been a ""very special episode"" but nowadays, with the climate crisis, its message - keep the environment clean, don't damage a beauty spot beyond repair, a bit more than ""Give a hoot, don't pollute!"" from Woodsy Owl has never been more relevant.

Seeing Cyril Sneer *(*who was originally the antagonist/villain, but seemed to soften in later seasons*)* throwing cash around and asking the big question of ""how much can you put a price on a priceless environment?"" has never been more relevant even now, and it made the story seem ahead of its time in a way.

In 2020, this episode is more relevant then it was back then.

I haven't seen every episode of this show, but this one is worth seeing if you can. I've had to re-watch it via piracy, unfortunately, since the show isn't getting re-runs at the moment.

Sure, it's a kids' cartoon, but I did enjoy this show as a kid and it's one I have some nostalgia of.

With the upcoming reboot due around Thanksgiving, I thought I'd mention the original show here.

I hope this is within the rules on political content here, since it's not about a political show.",0,1583361942,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fdla5s/the_one_that_got_away_an_episode_of_the_raccoons/,television,1

fdfg52,pm_me_reason_to_livx,"Desenfrenadas (Netflix) is a new hidden gem, and it's surprisingly wonderful.","***Warning: Mild spoilers ahead because I can't do this write-up without giving away a few details.***

With barely any marketing in the U.S. whatsoever, not even a trailer posted or any mention of it on Netflix' U.S. social sites, only Latin America, I must say Desenfrenadas is pretty much the hidden gem for Netflix originals this year so far. The synopsis describes it as, ""three young women on a road trip crosses paths with a desperate hitchhiker who forces them to change direction"", but I don't think this synopsis nor the trailer does the series any justice, as the narrative delves a lot deeper than that.

Desenfrenadas in the long-run ends up being quite a surprise too because it's not the cheesy, heavily-cliched, absurdly-dramatic Mad Dogs-esque '*road trip gone wrong*' dramedy that the first 2 episodes would have you believe. Well, in some ways it is, but things get much more nuanced, and might I dare say *even better* than Mad Dogs. Desenfrenadas isn't one to over-rely on melodrama, suspense or excitement to keep viewers invested. Plot-wise it isn't too obsessed with ending episodes on shock, cliffhangers or something eventful either, but those elements are there, just presented in a non-forcibly way, which allows the story and series as a whole to feel quite genuine, even when there's a villainous rapey drug-lord (who thankfully we don't see too much of). 

Desenfrenadas isn't just a series about a road-trip gone wrong, essentially it's the emancipation of it's main characters. The backstory and depth of the 4 main characters, and vast level of character development shown within these 10 episodes are an emotional delight. Rocío has quite a poignant backstory, which in hindsight plays a major part in the message the series sends with her narrative, which is ""sometimes you have to stop walking in other's footprints and create your own to find happiness"". Carlota comes with a lot of feminist talks, as expected for a female-dominated series, but it isn't too on-the-nose or in-your-face. It's as frequent, opinionated, and biased as it is would be in a lot of situations where a group of girls are spending the weekend together and having constant conversations.... well, at least until it came time for the girls to overcome the variety of toxic masculinity depicted in this series, and trust me it is most welcoming.   

Vera is favorite character of the group and easily my favorite character of any series this year so far. Finally a fashionable hipster ""preppy barbie"", who isn't just here for the writers to poke fun at or to tell the viewers how pretentious these people are. She's the '*can't stay off my phone for 10 minutes*' type of character that, realistically speaking, I think is missing from a lot of these young-adult/teen dramas. She's also self-indulgent, erratic and her overly-dramatic storm-offs can be quite hilarious, but as the series slowly delves deeper and deeper into this character, the more you emphasize with her. Vera and Marcela also provides a great contrast between the upper-class and the less fortunate, showing us that everyone has problems but some will more dire than others. The acting is also superb, and the dynamic between the main character feels so genuine as if they've really been friends since high school, this is a major part in why the series works.

Episode 6 of Desenfrenadas titled ""mujeres tormenta"" is easily my favorite episode of the year so far. It's 34 minutes of pure heart and tranquility, and for me solidified the series as a whole. Episode 7 was also a lovely follow-up with some laid-back trippy beach vibes, and also was the visual highlight of the series. At first sight I thought the lighting of the series might've been too dim, and the cuts are at times very visible, but in the long run the series really made up for it with some very aesthetically-pleasing visuals displaying the beautifully homely scenery of Mexico. 

In retrospect, Desenfrenadas is a well-detailed, authentic and scenic character-driven drama that gets better and better with each episode. It's a series that has all the elements of an absurdly dramatic and forcibly exciting situation-drama, but refrains from doing so instead putting much focus on it's main characters and allowing them to find themselves within the complications.  

    rating: 9.2 out of 10

fde2lv,Smileyguy666,Blooper videos of Its Always Sunny are next-level awesome!,"Blooper videos from most shows are based on mistakes made by the actors, and everybody cracks themselves up. The majority of blooper videos from Its Always Sunny are based on either the sheer absurdity of the scene itself or the actors trying to one-up each other, trying to be as nasty and outrageous as they possibly can. And they are all clearly living their best life.

fd9iij,CheesyObserver,What show would you like picked up for the 2020-2021 Pilot Season?,"There’s a lot of network shows casting and filming for their pilots this time of year and I think it’s an exciting time to solidify what you are interested in if a familiar face joins the show. 

But unfortunately, not every show will make it past the pilot stage. 

Personally, I’m intrigued NBC’s *Ordinary Joe*, it follows a guy (I assume is) named Joe as he makes a choice in his life and we the viewer get to see the following events play out in 3 parallel universes, each universe being a different choice he made. Starring James Wolk of 2019’s *Watchmen*. I hope this one gets picked up to series.

What are you interested in and what do you hope gets picked up?

fd8rjq,dontblink123,"Frank Lambert, the father from Step By Step, is trash","I need to rant about something but I have no one to talk to about it so here we go:

Frank Lambert is a piece of shit.

You may be wondering, who the fuck is Frank Lambert. If you were a fan of ABC's TGIF lineup, you will know who I am talking about when I say he was the father on Step-by-Step.

Seriously, though. This dude sucks you guys.

I was sitting around trying to decide what to watch today when Step-by-Step popped up in my mind as I had just been talking about it (different story). So, I decided to play the pilot episode.

I made it five minutes before I realized that Frank Lambert is a complete piece of garbage and the fact that ANY woman would marry him, let alone have kids with him, is insane.

At the beginning of the episode, we open on his kids in a DISGUSTING house trying to have cereal for breakfast when they realize the only food they apparently have in the kitchen is gone. He walks in and they complain about their lack of food when Frank says ""I've only been gone for a week."" BRO, YOU LEFT YOUR KIDS HOME ALONE FOR A WEEK? The oldest is like 13.

Where was Frank, you may ask? He was apparently in Jamaica. Bro left his kids alone without adequate food to go on an island vacation.

Next scene we meet Carol's kids in her nice, clean and spacious home. She is a self-sustained woman with her hair business attached to her home. She also apparently just came back from a trip to Jamaica, which we learn when Frank shows up and kisses her and they talk about being on the island together.

Aw, nice. This couple took a trip together you may think. NOPE, they just both ""ended up"" in Jamaica through fate. I say fate because Frank lets it slip that he apparently only went after talking to Carol's travel agent to find out where she was going. HE WAS LEGITIMATELY STALKING HER.

At this point, I figure Carol will flee but no, she instead says ""how romantic."" Bitch, are you fucking serious?!

She also says she wants a divorce. These two, grown-ass adults who have kids got married after only vacation-dating for like a week. Carol wants a divorce, ya know because she is a semi-sane person. Frank fucking gaslights her and says they can just date and introduce the kids to each other and then after the appropriate amount of time they can reveal the marriage.

They introduce the kids and (shockingly) things don't go well. Frank's son JT calls Carol a bimbo and accuses the two of dating. Frank then says she isn't a bimbo and they aren't dating, they're married. MOTHER FUCKER YOU HAD ONE FUCKING JOB.

The NEXT DAY, Frank and his kids move into Carol's home and bring a pig because I mean sure.

Let's review.

Frank Lambert:

1. Stalked a woman  
2. Left his kids home alone for a week to go on vacation  
3. Married his stalking victim  
4. Gaslighted her to stay together  
5. Blew the first secret they had as a couple  
6. And uprooted his children's lives to move into the home of a woman he barely knew (except for what he learned through stalking).

The pilot itself has insane viewing numbers, i’m surprised they aren’t pushing into the release quicker. I really enjoyed the show and the characters, felt like nothing insanely new I suppose but was filmed so well that it had me gripped the whole time. The lead actor Richard Madden is someone to keep an eye on (Not that he wasn't in Game of Thrones or anything) but he's very captivating in this especially. I could even see him being James Bond one day, bringing back the Scottish accent into the series like Connery started.

fd51gs,Kushostratus,Why Watching Movies and TV is Good for You,"# Why Watching Movies and TV is Good for You

📷 

I  was on the train back from London last night, my thoughts wandered and I  started thinking about all the time id spent watching movies and tv.  All the memories, the moment's of suspense, fear, humour and emotion  that was crafted for my enjoyment. It dawned on me that all these  moments weren't a waste of time, they were apart of who I am. Similar to  all the meals I've had in the past, I can't remember them all, I can't  remember every intricate detail of past memories yet they are what has  made me, they are what have led me through the gruelling bleakness of  winter depression, they are what accompanied those sweet euphoric  moments of watching a film with my girlfriend cosied up away from the  relentless stresses of the modern world.

I  think back on movies such as raging bull, teaching me the consequences a  simple psychological issue such as insecurity could have in all spheres  of my life, the alluring benefits of materialism shown in wolf of wall  street that could never fill the vacuous void a life without meaning  creates.

The dual nature of humans  as both victims and perpetrators of malice and greed that breaking bad  taught me better than any book. The realistic nature of watching  something and entering this fictional reality highlighted to me how the  nature of the real world is never as black and white as its often made  out to be. The multitude of dynamics at play that create the so-called  villains and the falseness of many heroes within society is invaluable.

For  all of history, wisdom has transfused itself through fables and  allegories, this method of acquiring knowledge is both fun, engaging and  informative. Movies and TV have taught me lessons that I could never be  taught in a classroom. So when I hear people tell me I'm wasting my  life watching films, that it is not a real hobby, I see people  forgetting what makes life worth living, who haven’t experienced the  very real emotions and pearls of wisdom that these outlets provide. The  time to relax and learn simple wisdoms is a gift of life that is needed  to remind ourselves what we are working for, a time to relax, put the  feet up and enter a reality where we can perceive the world in a new way  and broaden our minds at the click of our fingers. And that to me, is a  healthy and needed facet of being a human, coming together to enjoy the  stories we can collectively discuss and observe. It is apart of being  human which you should not feel guilty about spending time doing. So  enjoy and savour the viewing experience.",6,1583284178,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fd51gs/why_watching_movies_and_tv_is_good_for_you/,television,1

fd058h,CaptainRyuk,Is American Animation's popularity worldwide very overlooked? Why is it so ignored American cartoons are almost just as huge as anime is?,"In a discord chat, someone made this post.

&gt;I am wondering why Japanese animation got such an explosion worldwide to the point not only were Japan's biggest hits such as Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, and Saint Seiya are recognizable icons even to people who never heard of anime and liked to an extent by anime haters but they even out rated local shows in foreign countries!

&gt;I mean for example not a single Italian cartoon series had been able to come close to achieving the popularity of Dragon Ball and Saint Seiya in Italy and in the Philippines Yu Yu Hakusho had far more viewing than even successful live action TV dramas and soap operas in the Philippines!

&gt;Only the American cartoon industry could compete with many American cartoon icons like Spongebob, Scooby Doo, and the Flintstones achieving international popularity and Disney (with Pixar and perhaps to a lesser extent Dreamworks) animated films being hits much everywhere they release their films.

&gt;And even than the Japanese industry has a big edge over the American animation one. Only the shows that were hits in their original broadcast such as Spongebob find international airing and its only Disney's and Pixar's films that consistently scores the box office in foreign markets (though Dreamworks' Shrek was a pretty huge hit worldwide).

&gt;Japanese anime on the other hand not only had its mega hits find massive success around the world but even merely moderately successful shows like Cowboy Bebop and obscure ones such as Big O become such big hits despite not scoring stunning ratings back in homeland Japan. In some cases the original mangaka and studios are only able to make a profits with such failures because of the international success.

&gt;Big O to use as an examples was actually canceled in its original run in Japan but it was such a surprise smash hit in North America that the studio actually resumed the series! Sonic X would receive a North American only second season which ironically would later get dubbed in Japanese (despite the first season originally made in Japanese for Japanese audiences).

&gt;If anything, the Japanese industry succeeded where the American industry could not; create shows targeting older audiences that were not inane comedies (in the vein of South Park and Family guy) and attain considerable commercial success (Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the shell being the prime example I can think off). Even their shows aimed at kids and teenagers attain success at older audiences if Sailor Moon and Dragon Ball are anything to show.

&gt;Only American animated cartoon aimed at kids I can think off that had such major success with adults comparable to DBZ and Sailor Moon is Spongebob Squarepants.

&gt;Lets go it a step further and I'll state many shows that would be taboo to watch by the opposite gender ""back in Japan"" find tremendous success with said gender internationally!

&gt;Admitting you like Sailor Moon even as a elementary kid in Japan is already social suicide. But at least half the Sailor Moon fandom is male worldwide!

&gt;Many other series that were meant to only be like ""by little girls"" such as Cardcaptor Sakura, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Rose of Versailles not only have primarily adult fans in the West but the ratio of male-female fan ratiois basically at the same level as Sailor Moon.

&gt;Many series intend to be aimed only at certain genre fans have most of its international fans don't even follow said genres.Captain Harlock for example has its French fandom mostly consisting of non-Sci Fi/Space Opera fans.

The same person later posted this as a replay in the chatroom to someone else's response.

&gt;I mentioned in the earlier chats that other than Japan, its only North America that managed to dominate the animation industry on a global scale. To the point that , just like anime, many American iconic cartoon characters such as Scooby Doo are so much far more ****ing famous than most local animated shows produced in other countries that even your 50 year old Grandma who's survived through World War II in Romania can recognize who Tom and Jerry in an instant and American cartoons (much like many anime classics) can often far exceed even the most popular locally produced live TV show in TV ratings.

&gt;However looking back on that chat, it made me curious about one thing.

&gt;When I was young (around elementary and middle school) and anime was just getting big in North America, I remember thinking how awesome anime was and how Japanese animation is not only superior to American cartoons but anime was far more ****ing popular than American cartoons ever were.

&gt;In fact I remember how so many kids my age (including myself) even honestly believed that American cartoons were only popular in the United States (and to a lesser degree Canada). That anime was more accessible because so many more people watched Dragon Ball Z and other classics worldwide outside the English speaking world than say Johnny Quest or the Animaniacs.

&gt;Of course I grew up and forgot about anime/manga. But quite recently I've been rewatching childhood classics of various mediums including American cartoons and anime from The Slayers to Jackie Chan Adventures to Friends and with a more open mind, I was surprised just how popular many beloved classics of American animation such as Timon and Pumbaa and the Flintstones were just as beloved worldwide as many popular anime series, Granted most of these shows are now a distant memories in the foreign countries they once dominated (as opposed to many anime classics which still gets reruns on local channels in the nations they dominated such as Cardcaptor Sakura) and many anime franchises are much bigger cashcow internationally especially in merchandise sales.

&gt;But man the shock I had when I learned to this day Flintstones is still beloved in Mexico that some local channels rerun it. Even moreso when I also discovered the series is essentially about the MOST POPULAR import Hungary received from America (well at least as far as animation goes; I seen conflicting statements in forum boards but the general consensus is that the show is so beloved its ratings when it first aired int he country still beats many locally produced live action dramas). Hell I seen at least one Hungarian poster state they still rerun the Flintstones on the country's equivalent of Cartoon Network and ABC! In both countries in addition to still airing the show on public TV, merchandise is selling quite well.

&gt;Also the fact the Powerpuff Girls was a smash hit in Japan also shocked me too.

&gt;To use an equivalent of BIg O getting another season because of its popularity when it aired in America, Timon and Pumba literally got a 5th and final season because of how well it was doing outside of North America. I was just surprised to learn this beloved classic of my childhood was only an above average hit in overall popularity in the U.S. but internationally its a beloved cult classic with so many fans. fudge we only got about 4 vhs releases here in the states while internationally at least half the show has been released on VHS and later transferred to DVD (slams computer)!

&gt;Not even going into Disney which dominates the Box Office everywhere and Spongebob Squarepants (don't get me started on this one's international popularity).

&gt;There are so many examples but just these two (Dosney and Spongebob) alone makes me wonder about how much more mainstream anime is beyond its demograph outside of Japan? I mean other than the mega hits, the general populace overall doesn't know anything other than Naruto or Sailor Moon (exception being France and Italy).

&gt;However I'd still give the slight edge to anime as being the overall more popular one because so many niche genres manage to sell well internationally (as opposed to North America-Heavy Metal didn't do well in the Box Office). In addition to niche genres catered to Otakus and perverts, even many big flops like Big O manage to not only find fandom among Otakus outside of Japan but even hit the mainstream and get non-anime viewers as fans. I still remember how many adults who never heard of anime before were talking about how awesome Big O was when it was still airing on Toonami and later Adult Swim.

&gt;I mean its a telling thing many flops get several more seasons just because it scored well specifically in one country outside of Japan. I mean even here in North America it takes being a hit in SEVERAL countries (often sharing the same language like Latin American nations) to even be considered to have a renewed season. That certainly was the case for Timon and Pumbaa which was poular in many Spanish speaking countries along with Western European nations and Russia (and nearby nations to it).

&gt;But overall back to the main question-is American animation really just locally popular like many otakus (and teens who think anime is all awesome) assume it is? Does Japan really have the monopoly in international popularity in its animation, TV series specifically? Just the mention of Flintstones, Timon and Pumbaa, Powerpuff girls, and Spongebob Squarepants really makes me doubt the anime industry has a grip on importing titles elsewhere and has a monopoly overall in the global market. I mean American Cartoons seem like an easy contender for being a VERY VERY VERY close 2nd place as dominant force in the animation industry.

&gt;Anime still dominates because of how it overshadows many local cartoons in countries its imported to by a [expletive] LARGE DEGREE (if not outright destroying the local industries). But as I note I notice American cartoons often take up the animation time slot when anime isn't showing on foreign country TV. I mean I remember seeing a commercial of a French TV's children block and in addition to Saint SEiya, Sailor Moon, DBZ, and Hokuto No Ken it also featured senes of the latest Scooby Doo series running at the time, the Animaniacs, and other beloved childhood cartoons of mine! 

Indeed as the discorder says in the Chatroom, on the internet and in North America, there's an assumption American animation is just popular in America and Canada, with Disney being the exception. That not only has anime far surpassed American cartoons world wide in popularity but American animated don't get exported worldwide and thus  lack the cultural impact that anime does. I seen many posts where English speakers assume because it is aimed at children, American animation is simply something that stays in America aside from Disney. That stuff like Spongebob lacks the cross cultural appeal that say DBZ and Sailor Moon has.

I myself was surprised to learn Spongebob is beloved worldwide on an immediate google search. So words cannot describe it when I learned much of what the quoted stuff above the discord user posted was true such as Flintstones being popular in not just South of the Border but even across Latin America. Even having a cult fandom in anime dominant countries like France and Italy! The same with even shows that were just modestly popular in North America like Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends and The MisAdventures of Flapjack! They were translated across multiple languages, including Japanese ironically!

So basically I have to ask. Is the popularity of American animation world wide quite overlooked? Is American animation a direct competitor to the anime industry? In addition as a bonus why did North America manage to become a cultural powerhouse and superpower export of animation, only to be matched by the Japanese animation industry? Why couldn't say France match Canada's high frequency of translating local cartoons to other language to be aired across the world? Why can Germany not create a local show that gets say gets the huge amount of international adoration and continued viewership that Scooby Doo does? Why can't Italy create its own counterpart to Spongebob as an exported cultural impact?

Even Britain, the one country that has native animated shows that can meet American cartoons and anime in quality and overseas popularity, has not created anything close to Disney's monopolizing dominance of animated movies. And they made a number of hit beloved animation thats been aired across the world such as the current on-going Adventures of Gumball! Even in than, lots of British productions are coordinated projects with American and Canadian companies so its not really a ""British"" product imported per say but Anglo-Saxon importation!

So I am curious why America's impact on animation world wide is so overlooked esp on the internet? I'm still surprised Scooby Doo received Arabic and Hindi dubs and Powerpuff Girls was a popular in Japan back in its heyday (and still a beloved cult classic)!",16,1583264469,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fd058h/is_american_animations_popularity_worldwide_very/,television,1

fczqkp,ArnieLarg,Is the quality of animation in anime really subpar to Western cartoons?,"One of the criticism towards anime is that its animation is subpar in quality. In particularly criticized are constant re-use of stock footage (particularly in transformation and attack sequences), the lower frames per second, less detailed animation (in particular lack of stuff like clothes flying along with wind movement), and in particular the fact anime doesn't really draw lips to match dialogue when characters are speaking and lack of accurate emotional expression (such as changes in facial muscles when someone is showing anger, etc).


Now before this turns into a flame, let me point out I generally PREFER American cartoons over anime. Most of my favorite animated series are American classics such as Scooby Doo:Where Are You and The Flintstones. So I'm not defending anime because I'm a Japanophile or Otaku.

With that pointed out, I notice a lot of criticism lately towards anime because of animation quality. In particular the things I listed in the first paragraph (lack of lips and mouth movement that accurately reflect speech in particular and overuse of stock footage in particular). Not just from pro-Western cartoon aficionados but even anime fans (including Otakus) are saying that anime lacks the details, fluidity, frames, and in general overall basic animated movements ""found in Western cartoons"".

They also point out that there is no more reason for anime to be so cheap because budgets are much higher than the past as opposed to the 60s and 70s when Japan was still recovering from the War.

Quite frequently I always hear ""Sailor Moon Crystal lacks the details and fluidity of Adventures of Gumball"" or ""The Simpsons had far superior mouth-to-lip movement than Dragon Ball Z ever had"" and so on.

I got huge problems with these assumptions.

First and foremost to comment on the 60s and 70s, as someone who's been rewatching Childhood memories such as Bugs Bunny shorts and Johnny Quest, I will point out that there are so many [expletive] examples of stock footage and animated with limited details in the West (specifically America's) Golden Age of animation. Almost everytime Quick McDraw whacked his guitar around or swung on the rope as he's doing some heroics, flatout they are reusing the same scenes from the first several episodes. As in after going up to 20 episodes, You'll finally recognize it and come out after the current episode ends with a ""OMG swinging that rope-the backgrounds, colors, details, lip movements, everything are the same as in episode 3!"" reaction.

If you're binge watching, you'll notice this by episode 9.

In addition the character animation are quite slower in flames and less fluid once you been watching the show for a while.

To quote a series that has a reasonably large production (for the time), Johnny QUest often mixes new details (like a new island) and mixes it with old background (as in using the same scene with the same exact boats, cloud formations, etc.) If you observe completely newly drawn scenes such as walking in a ruins under rainy/windy conditions, you'll notice that many real life details are missing. The floor doesn't form puddles, the plants aren't moving despite the windy weather, etc.

Even the action is so poorly detailed it looks like stock footage at times (even though many of them are actually newly drawn scenes).

Just two examples but with these and many other old cartoons, I can point out the West was roughly about equal with anime in terms of budget issues and using ""lazy tricks"" to save money.

Now with modern animation, these complaints irk me far more.

Now note that many of the times, series that are being used to prove Western animation's supremacy are almost universally Spongebob, Disney, The Simpsons? And any less well-known shows often include series on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon's block?

While anime often being used to prove Japan has inferior animation techniques are often obscure series, often in niche genres and aimed specifically at Otakus, such as High School DxD and Freezing?

In otherwords I strongly disagree with the notion of Western cartoons having superior quality in drawing of animated movements because people are always picking any random anime and comparing it to the CREAM of the CROP the west has to offer; or at least shows that managed to stand on its own long enough to gain popularity for higher budget.

I mean how come no one (appropriately) compares Super Duper Sumo (a low budget and short series) to other equally relatively unknown low budget series like Queen's Blade or Red Photon Zillion?

Dragon Ball Z and Slayers gets all the bashing for its early episodes being notoriously full of BS animation cheap tricks. Uhh the early episodes of Spongebob Squarepants had a very ""low quality"" look to it and I learned Nickelodeon wasn't even sure if the series would last 10 episodes in its first year of syndication. As Spongebob exploded in popularity the animation had a magnificent improvement in details, colors, and other animation elements.

I mean I've just finished Slayers Evolution-R and man the quality budget of it and Revolution is far superior to previous seasons; even taking into account year gaps for Revolution to air, the first Slayers TV series had a low production value even within the standards of newly aired anime. When I was watching Spongebob before I caught up to the new episodes airing this year, I was thinking literally the same thing as Slayers Revolution of how the early season looks so cheap and was full of stock footage and the like.

I also notice you never see ""stupid"" series used to compare. I mean South Park has far worse animated details than even hentai series by unknown studios! I'll grant South Park is deliberate but no one ever says the same about series that were intentionally made to look cheap (even if they got far higher productions) such as Boogiepop Phantom.

So I seriously call BS here. Its not so much that Western animation standards is superior but when people make comparisons they are always choosing successful series such as The Simpsons or big productions like Disney and cherrypicking unknown anime series (or cherrypicking parts of the series rather than comparing the entirety).

I can point out to so many unknown cartoons in addition to Super Duper Sumos such as Street Shark that utilize animation quality similar to series frequently criticized such as Sailor Moon (many which even use far more stock footage and have far worse animation than even 1980s budget anime like Red Photon Zillion!).

Also this comparison is often flawed because........ Notice they always use AMERICAN CARTOONS? They're using the works of a nation that is known to easily be second place in dominating the animation industry after Japan (even at times going equally in influence and commercial dominance, if not outright far beating the Japanese anime industry by a large margin in certain genres and markets). Western animation fans and even anime fans who believe cartoons are superior conveniently cherrypick works from a nation that time and again produced mega box office hits that still dominate movie gross today such as Frozen and The Lion King.

I mean if Western animation as a whole had superior animated details, how come we rarely hear about French, Italian, British, and Russian works being phrased as superior to anime? Other than a few hits in the UK that was imported into America (such as The Adventures of Gumball), its almost always exclusively American shows being used to show off the Western animation industry's superiority to anime in animation quality.

Having seen works from Europe, I can tell you the average cartoon made int that continent made have far worse quality than even low quality budget anime series like Freezing and Toiei's productions. For example the only French cartoon worthy of being superior to big Japanese productions like Ghibli Studio's are modern Asterix the Gaul
series (and even these have episodes of terrible animation qualities ever now and than) and big production blockbusters such as the recent Little Prince 3D CGI flick.

What do you think? I firmly hold my opinion a lot of cherrypicking of cream of the crop and lack of taking account of sturgeon's law is why this claim of anime being far lower in quality is utter BS.

And remember I generally PREFER Western animation and most of my favorite animated franchises are American such as Scooby Doo, The Flintstones, and The Adventures of Gumball.",3,1583262944,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fczqkp/is_the_quality_of_animation_in_anime_really/,television,1

fcz1p7,xr280xr,Something seemed off with Conan and Flula Borg last night. What do you think?,"I just watched Conan s10 e25 from 3/2/2020 and the interview felt borderline uncomfortable and seemed almost like Conan was pissed at Flula Borg, or just didn’t want to be there. Conan was very low energy, not really laughing at or playing off of any of Flula’s jokes or mispronunciations. This is much different from past interviews between the two. Or like maybe Conan just got terrible, tragic news before starting the show and he couldn’t focus on the interview.

At one point he seemed to be making a joke about there being, “no time” to give several high five attempts from Flula, though he wasn’t delivering it as if he even thought it was funny. But then at the end he said Flula deserved the “fist bump” he’d been waiting for and fist bumped him at the point in the show where he always shakes the guest’s hand, making me think he actually didn’t want to touch Flula’s hand for some reason. Something seemed off. Did anyone else pick up on this?

fcy9hl,NovaKay,Why did the family in 'Mr Belvedere' have Mr Belvedere in their lives?," 

They were clearly just a regulation middle-class family. Dad was a sportswriter which would've paid decent but nothing great. Mum was studying law so she wasn't pulling down any cash at the time. They lived in a standard house; not like a mansion or anything. There was only the four of them: Dad, Mum, and the two kids. What the *hell* were they doing with a butler? Why did they think they needed one? How could they afford one? What did he do all day besides turning up with a tray of drinks now and then and ironing a few shirts?",26,1583257420,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fcy9hl/why_did_the_family_in_mr_belvedere_have_mr/,television,1

fcxs33,Jordanashwalker20,Powerpuff girls down n dirty.,"Now this episode is about buttercup becomes dirty and refusing to take a bath. She’s fighting these monsters thats making her dirty and smelly, and yet she thinks it’s ok for her to go around smelling like that to the point where the WHOLE town turns against her! As mean spirited this may seem to me, but however, what makes buttercup thinks ok for to stink so much just because she doesn’t want to take a bath. She for some reason thinks that if she takes a bath, she won’t be able to fight monsters again. 

Um, excuse me Buttercup but what does taking a bath have anything to do with you not fighting monsters again, just take a bath,that’s it. There is no reason for you to stink and be dirty like, you are a little girl and that is not lady like of her.

Conan was very low energy, not really laughing at or playing off of any of Flula’s jokes or mispronunciations. This is much different from past interviews between the two. Or  like maybe he just got terrible, tragic news before starting the show and he couldn’t focus on the interview. 

He seemed to be making a joke about there being, “no time” to give several high five attempts from Flula, though he wasn’t delivering it as if he even thought it was funny. But then at the end he said Flula deserved the “fist bump” he’d been waiting for and fist bumped him at the point in the show where he always shakes the guest’s hand, making me think he actually didn’t want to touch Flula’s hand for some reason.

fcj92x,Zepanda66,"Star Trek's William Shatner Won't Return for New Series: ""Kirk’s Story Is Pretty Well Played Out""","Bit sad but kind of expected. 

&gt;This isn’t the first time that Shatner has downplayed the idea of returning to active duty in the Star Trek universe. ComicBook.com spoke to Shatner ahead of his Grand Ole Opry debut in February 2019. He shared his thoughts on the idea of returning to television.


&gt;“That word, ‘resurrect.’ That’s a key word,” Shatner says. “Resurrect. You’d have to resurrect me, Shatner, in order to do the daily. I don’t know what Patrick is doing doing that. Doing a series is debilitating for a young guy, for a 25-year-old, which I was doing when I was 25 years old. It’s a physical wrecker, it’s a mental wrecker, and it’s a homewrecker ‘cause you’re working 14, 18 hours a day. And in the last series I did, Boston Legal, I had, in rush hour, a two-hour commute. So add that. So no, I would not be interested in doing a series, per se.”

fcil5k,prolelol,So I just finished watching Gossip Girl for the first time. Any thoughts?,"As a 22 years old guy, I finished it after looking up for similar show like Desperate Housewives and plus I watched it for Blake Lively. Here are my thoughts:

I honestly loved set design and the outfits they put Serena and Blair in were always perfect.

The first 3th seasons were very good and a lot of fun to watch. Season 4 was a bit exaggerated, but it went alright. I honestly loved the friendship between Dan and Blair in there.

**SPOILER WARNING**

Season 5 &amp; 6.. uhm... no words.. I have absolutely no words how the last two seasons were trash. Dan and Blair might have been one of the most beautiful enemies to friends to lovers romantic arc ever written for television until the writers took a shit all over it. 

The series finale was good, but I don't like how Blair ended up being with Chuck. The romantic relationship between these two is already very toxic, manipulative and emotionally abusive. And they can't help that they still love each other. And Dan is too perfect for Serena, I hated her since Season 5, she is so pathetic, manipulative, can't be without boys without an hour and used many things. And I also didn't like the idea who is Gossip Girl.

Overall, this show was fun to watch for once, but  I'm still mad by how mess the last two seasons are.

I think the format of this interrogation led anthology series is to let the viewer have a chance of being the investigator, unlike traditional whodunits where all the facts are not with the audience and they are doing a guessing game, here they and the interviewing officers are on the same page.

The first episode just blew my mind. David Tennant's most nuanced, subtle performance. Those series of ""no comment"" s and when did you first really suspect him ? I was taken aback with the dialogue, don't remember exact words but where he says fathers are angry when daughters have sex something like that. It came off very odd and very off.

fcelcf,CuriousPossibility7,Most intense character revealing TV dialogues from the last decade and why ?,"What would be the most intense dialogues you have heard in the last decade in Television shows ? Lines that made you understand the character clearer ...Lines that shook or shocked you or drove you to tears ..

Here's my list ! I tried to rank them but it's too difficult a job.

1. “So many vows…they make you swear and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the gods. Obey the laws. It’s too much. No matter what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or the other.” - **Jaime Lannister, Bear and the Maiden Fair, GOT.** Intense because before this you have not thought of Jaime much beyond a vicious arrogant man, and this tells a lot about the theme of moral ambiguity in GOT ( I mean when all that made sense )
2. I can't between ""I let you know me, see me, I gave you a rare gift you didn't want it "" ( **Hannibal**, season 2) and ""This is all I wanted for you Will for both of us"" ( **Hannibal**, season 3) It just sums up his character, love, desperation, his life philosophy and dreams... even some horror.
3. ""Your problem is you spent your whole life thinking there are rules. There aren't. We used to be gorillas. All we had is what we could take and defend. The truth is, you're more of a man today than you were yesterday."" - **Lorne, The crocodile's dilemma, Fargo**. I thought it is how most of the events in Fargo worked.
4. ""I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really - I was alive.""- **Walter White, Felina, Breaking Bad.** I was surprised some fans still have confusion about why Walt did what he did, but this was the best summing up of what he was and why he broke bad.
5. ""You Know, either everyone feels like this a little bit, and they're just not talking about it, or I'm completely f\*\*king alone. Which really isn't f\*\*king funny."" - **Fleabag**, I just thought that confusion and vulnerability had a beautiful universal appeal many of us wonder is my experience normal !",86,1583166557,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fcelcf/most_intense_character_revealing_tv_dialogues/,television,1

- Baskets s4
- Cake s1
- It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia s14
- Legion s3
- Mayans M.C. s2
- Mr. Inbetween s2

They may have added more archival stuff too (like I know Nip/tuck is a recent addition) but I can't tell. It's not the complete FX library either, as some shows are still on Netflix (American Crime Story) and Prime (The Americans). I can tell they forgot Unsupervised and Chozen for example, but then again they probably intentionally forgot those. 

Having to wait forever for new seasons of the FX shows to arrive on Hulu's a thing of the past now. New episodes will be on Hulu the day after they air on cable, in fact.

fc9u9r,TheReccher,"Daredevil season 3 was pretty mediocre when all is said and done, IMO. I just don't feel it will withstand the test of time.","And not it has nothing to do with Kingpin being a Trump allegory. No politics here. It just wasn't a very good season. Luke Cage S2 was leaps and bounds more interesting. 

Been holding in this feeling and I needed to get this out somewhere. Unfortunately the Daredevil boards and the Defenders boards are riddled with fanboys so I think a more generalized sub-reddit like this might be the place to do it. But man has this season gotten so much praise in the last year since it came out. I can't count the number of times I've seen a post compare it to the Dark Knight. Gotta say in my more feckless state I even lied to myself. I came out of DDS3 extremely disappointed, thinking ""that was it? That wasn't worth the two year wait."" But people can often shut their mind's ears. I came back to watch S3 again a year later to convince myself that my expectations were too high. And...

...nope. If anything, new issues I hadn't seen before were cropping up. Nadeem having a double digit I.Q. being one of them. And I was also reminded of the things that bothered me the first time. The way  it randomly put a halt to an exciting plot to randomly introduce a new element. The introduction of Nadeem was frustrating, the stupid Karen Page back-story was just the WORST. When a show makes you question if Netflix glitched and switched to another show, you know that the writing is tone deaf. Not to seem arrogant, but I can't help but feel most of the people watching the show now are the most ardent fanboys that will praise it no matter what. The whole season was nothing but wheel spinning. Half of the plot is a rehash of the first season, the other half relies on the characters being too dumb to be believable, and none of the game changing or revolutionary plot that the ads and most of S2 was hyping up even happened. i.e Fisk has Daredevil's identity and does NOTHING with it. 

Kingpin goes back to prison  and that's it. That's the ending, everything's hunky dory. That was fine in S1 because the characters were naive, but S3 was suppose to represent a battle weary, cynical Matt. I didn't buy for a second that just sending Fisk away would satisfy him after the amount of times he's been disillusioned with the system. It felt lazy and unearned.",14,1583142745,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fc9u9r/daredevil_season_3_was_pretty_mediocre_when_all/,television,1

fc6chh,slightlycharred7,Top 5 shows (that I’ve seen) w/ honorable mentions,"Some ground rules if I haven’t seen it or only a little I won’t include it. Also I won’t include anime even though some might be better than some of these shows but not all have made it to television yet or are censored/dubbed in shitty ways. 

1. Game of Thrones (never seen so many non fantasy watchers finally hop on the train. Also it did the books justice for at least the first 4-5 seasons and the books are the best thing I’ve ever read)
2. Breaking Bad (I could watch the last two seasons 20 times and never get tired of them)
3. Lost (Even if it went down hill it truly started people paying great attention to tv. The first time theories ran wild. Great mystery and good acting)
4. The Office US (I’ve never seen such a strong fanbase. Some have rewatched it 50 times over. Some of those fans haven’t even watched the last episode as they want to save it. Most of them say they’ll delete Netflix next year when it gets removed. Great comedy.
5. How I Met Your Mother (Wonderful comedy with the occasional tear jerking episode. A great romance story too. I personally didn’t hate the ending either. I felt it was obvious it would go that way.)

Honorable mentions: 

True Detective Season 1: Truly the greatest season of any show I’ve ever seen. I could watch it over and over. It’s also stand alone since it’s set up to have a new story every season. The next two seasons don’t live up to it but season 1 will never leave my memory. Phenomenal actors and acting. I wish I could put it in the list even with it only being this one season.

Westworld : It’s first season is astounding, it’s second season is great as well but couldn’t top season 1 and season 3 looks very promising especially with Aaron Paul joining the cast. This could join the greats when it’s done but that remains to be seen.

It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia: Amazing comedy that I love but it depends on your taste for the types of jokes they present. 

That 70s Show: a comedy classic. Just barely doesn’t make my top 5 but the later seasons can be rough. 

Ozark: The next season is taking forever but the show has the potential to be amazing.

Stranger Thing: Again remains to be seen if they milk it. Had they ended it last season it may have stood out as a great modern classic. 

The Wire: I haven’t seen enough of it but so many call it their favorite show and from what I’ve seen it is great.",21,1583121912,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fc6chh/top_5_shows_that_ive_seen_w_honorable_mentions/,television,1

fc60q1,w8watm8,Second season of Altered Carbon is missing the great atmosphere that made the first one so great!,"The atmosphere was one of the strong points of the first one, it gave you such an immersion like the portrayed universe was real. All those vibrant colours and that 18+ theme what you would expect from a run down city like they live in all that unnecessary violence combined with nudity and sex really made you feel like you are in the future ghetto. And on contrast there is the high ass buildings with the always sunny views. It just made everything awesome. 

It captured that feeling of never ending utopia where the rich lives forever while the poor struggles. Who ever is above the clouds is untouchable with beautiful sunny views while everyone under is just mere dirt where the only light is neon lights of clubs, bars and brothels.

I understand they are on a different planet but losing those visuals haven’t done anything good for the series, it’s just made it feel like they are running low on budget. The story was still good (first one was a thousand times better). 

They also cut back on a lot of adult content, I feel like the action scenes of the first season was a lot more violent and while in the first season you seen a naked body (topless) every 5-10 minutes the second one had like 2 nude scenes over the 8 episodes. And the thing is I don’t think it was meaningless violence/nudity in the first season either it was there for world building purposes. And it made sense. In a place where the rich oppresses the poor people whom have nothing only have those two options to succeed in life (sex or violence, maybe booth). The second season had a lot more family friendly marvel super hero series tone to it. Which is like a complete contrast to the first season.

Spoiler alert for the rest of my post;

Compared to how much money they have spent on the first season to look good the second one just felt so cheap. Every yakuza scene felt like they shot it in a one room studio so they just trying to make it work with what they have. 

Even tho it’s supposed to be a “richer” planet it still had run down city areas. Which I understand every city has them, but then make it look good. That chick who can hack all kinds of things with her hair holder who is supposed to be a master of electronics, runs a dark and dirty bar with no lights or anything appealing in there. Seems unreasonable when every bar/brothel had the sickest design in the first season. Also even the rich areas of the city didn’t look as good. First season they had a high ass mansion above the sky, where the story explored all different kinds of areas/rooms of the property. Second season had this yakuza family which was part of the founding people of the city (so they were supposed to be so much richer then the first season’s Meths) end every room they show in the property (which is like 3 rooms) block in at all sides so can’t see out and has like no design elements in it. (That’s not talking about the boss’s son introduced in a trap house looking building mixing drugs himself. Like yeah the son of one of the richest people would ever do that himself personally. It wasn’t like he was checking in on the production. He was mixing it himself!)  

End the ending.... I was just sitting there thinking are these guys stupid or what?! As I previously said the story was pretty good but when at the end they just casually walk into the lady’s house. It’s like come on, last time they met he literally shot her in the stack. Saying it doesn’t matter that she will spin back up he wants her to suffer. Then next time they meet, they just walk into her home like the security wouldn’t just try to kill them before they would even put their feet on her property. (They said they will surrender, but that said taking them into her house with such a reason seems unrealistic af) 

I could also add how the actor playing the side character (the hacker lady) supposed to be this big bounty hunter who got the main guy in the first episode is the least athletic person I have ever seen. I don’t care about her body type but her fight scenes are laughable. Like I would understand if they needed a hacker but in exchange they have to take care of her because she can’t fight. But instead everyone pretends like she is actually good at what she is doing and then her fight scenes look like playground fighting. 

Overall pretty good compared to other Netflix “super hero and super power” series, very disappointing compared to the first season!",108,1583120339,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fc60q1/second_season_of_altered_carbon_is_missing_the/,television,1

This all happens pretty clearly after everything else in the episode, right? But we also see Mac and Lily walking past ""the rock"" arm in arm. Doesn't that imply that they've made up somehow, after the Lily-Rob confrontation on the street? (That confrontation must also mean that Mac confessed his indiscretion to Lily, right?)

fbzuml,pm_me_reason_to_livx,"Queen Sono, Netflix' first African original series, is very ambitious.","It honestly surprised me because as we all know Netflix' has been iffy as of late when it comes to quality, but compared to every other African movie and TV show I've seen (not coming out of Israel), Queen Sono is a very well produced and very well written series.

Queen Sono is a thrilling and very fun to watch spy thriller, and though it's laced with classic spy-thriller tropes, which some viewers may even called 'cliche', you still get a great sense of unfamiliarity from the series. That mainly due to do with the setting, culture and languages of course, but it's also because the series does so much within its first 6 episodes. 

Queen Sono aims to be so much but it never feels like it's doing too much. Shot in at least 6 different African countries/cities and featuring a variety of languages (subtitles is a must when watching), Queen Sono has political elements relating to African politics itself, romance tensions and family drama that ties into the main story, and of course it's spy-thriller aspects comes with advanced technologies, suspenseful missions and lot's of fighting and shoot-outs. There's a lot going on here, from rebel groups trying to free Africa from colonization, to our main character investigating the death of her long-time freedom fighter mother, to a crazy Russian lady trying to kill said main character. It all makes for very complicated storytelling, but it's cohesive.

In some way Queen Sono is like a showcase of Africa itself. Sure, the cast constantly switching between several different languages can make it a bit difficult to keep up with dialogue, the fight choreography isn't great, and some of the acting isn't great either, but Queen Sono offers a lot and it's easy to grasp onto any of it's several ongoing stories. It has the makings of a great series in my opinion, it just needs a 3-4 season commitment and a healthy budget to tell it's story. Unfortunately the series seems to have flown under the radar, releasing it the same week as I Am Not Okay With This, Altered Carbon season 2 and the Love is Blind finale didn't do it justice. I'm doubtful, but let's hope it gets renewed.

fby6fm,daninlionzden,Rewatching season 2 of Westworld - people were too unfair to this season.,"Most people would agree that season 1 of Westworld is a masterpiece, or at least a season of critically-acclaimed quality. Season 2 did not receive a reception this warm, with many criticizing the pace, complexity, and lack of character development for certain characters.

Rewatching it now, it really is still of high quality, even if not that of season 1. The production value did not decline - the production design and visual effects are still top-notch. Each episode unfolds like a mystery, shedding layers as things fall into place. Characters are still tested and the plot still pushes them forward in unexpected ways (the reluctant Teddy + Dolores storyline is an example of this). There are also a lot of cool callbacks to season 1, and showing parallels between similar events. Like Ford’s new narrative in season 1, this season also presents a solvable mystery in the form of the Valley Beyond. 

2.04 “the riddle of the Sphinx” is an absolutely mindblowing 1 hour 10 minutes of television on its own, and 2.05 is a beautiful tribute to Akira Kurosawa.

Most importantly, while I acknowledge the time jumps were a little excessive, watching the season in binge-format rather than weekly-format does make me think that the plot is not as confusing as most people claim.

Very excited for season 3.",34,1583087092,https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/fby6fm/rewatching_season_2_of_westworld_people_were_too/,television,1
