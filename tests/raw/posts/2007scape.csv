fso7u4,The_TRD_Burglar,Golden Era of HCIM on Twitch?,"With *Roidie* now getting the DWH, *B0aty* 32 kc into TOB, and *Faux* 1-2 purples away from pushing TOB; Are we entering the Golden Age for HCIM on Twitch?   

This does not even include other strong HCIM accounts such as *Lake*, *BFRocket*, and *Alfie* that are also streaming on Twitch. There are many others too so I apologize if I left a name off this list.  

  
All 6 of these accounts in the next 2-3 weeks could be pushing 100+ KC on TOB and rivaling The General (Sick Nerd AKA The Flea) for best HCIM in the game which is just incredible. I cannot remember a time where the competition for HCIM was this HIGH and OSRS online activity was peaking.

fsn0my,Athylius,OSRS mobile - Ipad pro performance questions,"Hi everyone!

Hope you're all well and safe during these times.

I'm looking for some recent info/footage if possible on ipad pro performance. Especially so for the ipad pro 2020 refresher if anyone has one and plays. I've read mixed things from people but a lot of it is dated. Can anyone tell me what content they can do and what fps they get?

For example, what FPS do you get at the GE on a moderately busy world? What about doing pvm / slayer / raids / God wars etc?

Is there any major performance issues / crashes / bugs?

Currently looking at buying a tablet / 2 in 1 and I intiially considered the surface pro 7 and the galaxy tab s6 but I plan to do some drawing/art and the ipad pro is miles ahead in that aspect so here I am looking for all the info on osrs performance before I make the final decision.

about a week and a half ago i jokingly asked someone to barrow their tbow and the ge. He responded jokingly and we talked for awhile. he then added me and for a few days asked what i was up to and was very friendly. He then asked if i had heard about the mort myer swamp boat anti scam. I said no and he directed me to the youtube videos on ""max19pets"" youtube page. In which you watch the videos and it shows his ""friend"" being scammed and then how to do the anti scam. He then tells you every few days ohh i made 50m today doing the anti scam and this goes on for a week and a half. Then someone later in the month approaches you at the bank asking if you want to make some money for a boat ride. and you're like oh finally i can maybe take a scammer for some money.... This is not the case. They take you to the swamp but not to the boat. there is an area in mort myer swamp for whatever reason if you stand on a certain tile it teleports you without notice to another section of the swamp and it takes over the drop time to get back to the spot. essentially they ask you to drop your items and they'll trade you 50m and then you're teleported pointlessly.... 

There is no video or anything exposing this scam online. I am thinking about making an exposure video unless someone can get me in contact with a youtuber who would be interested in me showing them how this works so that they can expose it.

fskr88,wealldie1day,PvP God Wars,"Allign yourselves with Zamorak, Guthix or Saradomin to take part in a new pvp-based activity. If you remember Fist of Guthix, then you'll see some similarities in this activity.

# Location

* The starting location would be the mage bank. 
* The arena would be situated in deep wilderness where you will be teleported to, much like when you go for the mage capes. This is to try keep pking inside the wilderness rather than in a safe minigame setting.
* These will be played on themed worlds.

# Activity

Choosing to be a follower of Guthix

Guthix members carry around a stone like object that is 2handed and draws power from an arena and cannot be unequipped. The closer to the middle you are, the more power and points you gain from the environment to a point where you are given full charge. It is riskier to be in the middle as a member of Guthix because you are being hunted by a follower of Zamorak.

Choosing to be a follower of Zamorak 

Followers of Zamorak are tasked with hunting the follower of Guthix and killing them as fast as they can. Unlike fist of guthix, your role isn't only killing the Guthix player. You need to be on the lookout for followers of Saradomin who are attempting to hunt you. If you manage to kill the Guthix player before the Saradomin player has killed you, then the Saradominist will have failed their duty. As a Zamorakian, you can choose to kill the saradominist and ignore the guthix player. In doing so, you allow the guthix member to get closer to completing their task. If the Guthix member completes their task, you fail in your role as the Zamorkian.

Choosing to be a follower of Saradomin

As a Saradomonist, your task is to kill the zamorakian player before the Guthix member has died. Failing to save the Guthix player or dying yourself at the hand of the Zamorkian will mean you failed in your duty.

# Rewards

Winning rounds earns you points that can be used to purchase things from the activities shop. Some rewards are faction locked, such as cosmetic skull recolours to match your faction, while other rewards are factionless.
Other rewards include rune packs and various magic gear, including a tradabale scroll that can be used on pieces on to upgrade vestment robes. 

Devout Robes

Devout Robes are a new and higher tier of vestament robe. They require 60 prayer and 60 magic to wear. These robes have a set effect called Godly Devotion, which increases the accuracy and damage of god spells. How this scales is dependant on the amount of equipment from the god faction you're wearing, with a minimum requirement of wearing the mitre and both the  vestment robe top and bottom, and both your prayer bonus and prayer level. These robes are tradable.

Storm of Armadyl spell scroll and Staff of Armadyl

This spell was controversial based on a few factors. It had a minimim hit, attacked every 4 ticks and the magic gear of the time made this really strong. Rather than do these things, the osrs version of the spell would instead aim to mirror the Heavy Ballista for magic minus the special attack, with the same tick speeds and no rigour counterpart for magic to benefit it. You'd also need to cast charge to be able to access the spells true power as well as wield a staff of Armadyl. At 5 tick cast speed (instead of 4 tick), and no minimum hit, the spell would be a lot less devastating than our nostalgic and fearful minds may remember. 

# Balancing 

* This is a dangerous activity that is situated within the wilderness itself. 
* You will be force skulled upon entering this minigame with no teleport out other than completing/failing your duty.
* PKing someone will give you their loot.
* The activity is also indiscriminate of your combat level (restricted accounts are exactly that, restricting themselves).
* The mage won't let you participate unless you have a minimum magic bonus and level.
* Protection prayers are disabled.

Of course this activity could be made safe and balanced so level 70 Timmy can feel privileged, but that would take away the fun of the activity imo.",4,1585686969,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fskr88/pvp_god_wars/,2007scape,1

Hey everyone, I'm here advertising our clan today ""Dreaming of Purple"". We're a clan with a focus on player interaction on every front. Our members PvP, Skill, Raid, PvM, and bankstand and we have a good chunk of people ready to mentor new players or bring in new teammates.

If you have found yourself saying ""I really enjoy this game but there just seems like there is way more fun with people do to stuff with"" this is the place for you.

While we are still only about 30 members currently, we are well on our way to being active for events and consistent bossing teams. More recently we have been teaching new members how to do both CoX and ToB.

At the moment we are holding an event with prizes for recruiting new members, a bingo for PvM, and a skilling event soon for those interested.

(It's also worth mentioning that the name is not weed related, this seems to have been a problem for some)

There are no requirements to join but if you are straight off of tutorial island it may be a little while before you are able to participate in some group activities.

If you are interested in joining or just checking us out our discord at (discord)/GMnj7Aa or hop in the CC at ""DreamPurpCC""

fsgx8g,whathaveidonetwice,League Idea [Loyalty League],"&amp;#x200B;



&amp;#x200B;

Excuse the 5min map, obviously you cannot cut quest locations in half, along with regions.. but its for a general idea..

Divide the map. You are assigned a 'faction' (this will ensure that clans do not entirely control). Each has it's perks, each is different. Some 'factions' have other abilities.  Some sections have NPC's and drops that other's do not share.

&amp;#x200B;

Physical barriers prevent you from wandering or accessing or traveling to the other factions.  Everyone prepares the entire season, at the end of the season the barriers go down and all the factions go to war.  Last faction standing wins.

&amp;#x200B;

This will create a sense of community within strangers who are also in your own faction, and encourage communication between players to prepare for the War.  imagine the meme potential.

A large war can be broadcast on Twitch and I guarantee most people will want to participate in the next one.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Optional Idea would be to allow disputed territories throughout the season that opposite factions can  fight for and gear\]

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Post your faction perks here, along with NPC exclusivity /restrictions

There could also be an option to “fold” where you forfeit the next round but keep your inventory and the 3 most valuable items in your loot chest. The winner of each tournament gets some sort of grand prize, with 2nd and 3rd getting smaller prizes, and so on, probably in the form of virtual points for a reward shop, maybe for sets of untradeable degradable pvp gear that only works in pvp.

fsdrsw,-Adapted,Why is there no OSRS HD?,"One of the main excuses that Jagex has given us for no HD is that it will 'ruin' the old school aspect of the game. However if this is the case why did they bother giving us Raids, Spirit shields, Infernal Cape and all sorts of new content if they were that strict on maintaining the 'old school' dynamic? Why not just stick purely to 2007 and not add anything at all? The reason is simple: laziness.

Implementing HD graphics is something that majority of the playerbase wants and claiming that it will 'ruin old school' is nothing but a fallacy when it adds no gameplay changes whatsoever. It is simply bringing Runescape back to the prime days of 2008-2011 when the graphics became less stale and finally competed with other MMO'S. I don't care about Raids where I need at least 99+ in all combat stats just to participate, where 3/4 of the playerbase won't even achieve. I prefer not looking at stale combat animation from 2005.

fsdid0,Bad_News04,Discussion on PvP,"I see so many people complain about the current state of PvP in the game. Mostly talking about the wilderness. So I was wanting to ask what everyone's opinion is as to what is the issue with the wilderness, currently. I personally don't play in PvP worlds. That's not the content that I'm interested in. But I do enjoy the wilderness to an extent. I don't mind PKers. I don't mind losing fights. And successfully anti PKing is always really nice. The main issue that I have with the current wilderness is the presence of large clans. It's usually pretty easy to escape clans in single combat, even though anti PKing isn't as viable since you just get pulled off by another player if you start to beat his friend. If you can't avoid freezes for whatever reason, they just deplete your supplies and you eventually die. And being in multi without a team is pretty much GG unless you can tele or log. So I guess my main complaint with the wilderness is that you rarely see fair fights anymore. And I understand that it's not always going to be fair, and that's fine. But that simple fact makes me less likely to go into these hotter spots of the wilderness alone. Just because it's not fun to feel like you're always at a disadvantage.

To fundamentally solve this, **we have to change the player base**.  We need to bring in casual players.    


Something super easy Jagex can do in game to attract and retain new/casual players is to **categorize worlds by regions.**  

This was how the worlds were set up in the mid 2000s and personally it did a lot for me to play with the same group of players and feel a sense of community and belonging as well as irrational dislike and competitiveness against players from other regions.

fscirz,saruman66,The real PvP problem,"I recently saw a post saying that lot of people do not attend PvP, because it's hard to learn gear changing or prayer switching etc.

In my opinion that's not the reason.

The real reason is that in order to have good PvP results **YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CHARACTER WITH PVP STATS.**

I always see great pvp videos, with builds with **1 def, or specific att/str/def combo** etc. 

Here I am, **all of my combat stats are 90+ so I'm only able to try PvP with maxed character once I max my stats.** ~~^(()~~~~Or I create new character and spend A LOT of hours leveling it, just to try if I like PvP or not, no thanks)~~

Solution? 

**Allow people to lower their stats** (by talking to NPC - Hi - I want to lower my def - 1 - Yes). Of course you will be able to get your stats back to normal once you finish (-Hi -Reset my stats - Yes).

Imagine, you have maxed character and now you can try **ANY build**. 10HP + 99 STR? Sure! 1 DEF pure? Go on!

Runescape is a game where you can do ANYTHING with one character - be a mage / warrior / ranger / fisherman / hunter (etc.) but when it comes to PvP - sure **MAKE NEW CHARACTER WITH GOOD BUILD**!",8,1585659770,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fscirz/the_real_pvp_problem/,2007scape,1

fsbz31,olieolieolieoioioi,Suggestion for raids for low/mid levels or a dungeoneering-like minigame/skill,"&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, out of the ""new"" skills from RS3 I think dungeoneering is one of the most fun/rewarding skills to play. The best thing about it is that ALL players can join in - beginners to those who have maxed out, also it involves a good amount of teamwork vs. the solo skills.

The current set up we have on OSRS is raids - I've personally never done them as I'm probably not of a high enough level yet, but they look enjoyable. I think it would be great for OSRS to either create some low to mid level raids, or a new skill (similar to dungeoneering but unique!) or even a minigame type scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Players should be matched with other players of a similar CB level (and the skill level, if this becomes a skill). Level 3 skillers should be able to take part without having to engage in combat - possibly matching total level? Their roles would be just as important to succeed in the round - give skillers a way to fight bosses/assist the other players while being out of reach of damage.. e.g. making traps/supplying food/healing etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The rough premise would be you’re stranded on an island? Or in a cave? With the other players and no items/etc – everything needs to be created from scratch… players need to work together prioritising their best skills to help defeat a boss/minions?

Points earned by participation (prevent leeching), spent on some new rewards - cosmetics/useful items for skilling/new weapons/armour? BIS for F2P?

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also be very keen for a version of this to be open for F2P players, with their own unique rewards.

&amp;#x200B;

It’d be great if all skills can be involved. Combat skills for combat, fishing, hunting and cooking for food. Fletching, crafting, smithing and mining to make weapons, jewellery (which in turn can be enchanted with magic). Construction to make shelters, herblore potions, runecraft for runes, farming for herbs/fruit and so on....

&amp;#x200B;

fsb7o1,Krtxoe,PvP Items from LMS And Other Activities,"**Bring a reworked version of PVP items into the game as rewards from various PvP activities.** This new reworked version would make the items average in PvM and top tier in PvP.

**Activities**

You would be able to obtain different pieces from different PvP activities.

Weapon - LMS

Head - Bounty Hunter

Chest - ?? (PvP worlds or future activity)

Legs - Castle wars

You would be able to buy them with points, or as a rare drop depending on the activity. They are **non-tradeable, non-degradable, and break when you die** but stay in the inventory, requiring you to **spend 10-20m repairing it**. Some of the gold is dropped on the floor for the killer. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Items:**

Please note this is meant to be **top tier PvP-only** equipment.

**Armor:**

  
Statius  
Defenses similar to dragon but with some magic defense. No str bonus.

Zuriel  
A weaker version of Ahrims, but with some range defense.

Morrigan  
Comparable to red dhide, with a little bit more melee defense.

When wearing any of the full sets, **incoming player damage** is reduced. Something between 15 - 25%.

These  armours have somewhat low defenses, even against players, so it won't be difficult to hit through. However, in PvP, damage reduction is really nice. These armors will be top tier only in PvP.

**Weapons:**

When using weapons + the corresponding armour set, an additional effect is obtained.

Zuriel  
Extra damage + enhanced ancient magic effects (like in DMM). Enhanced effects only work on players.

Statius  
Extra damage + special attack that can only be used on players.

Morrigan  
Extra damage and accuracy on players.

The **weapons alone will not have special effects**. This is to discourage 1-iteming with the best pvp weapons.",0,1585653781,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fsb7o1/pvp_items_from_lms_and_other_activities/,2007scape,1

fsaeqk,mitchiswhoiam,Attempting to make social clan for supporting people struggling at the moment.,"Hi  


I had the idea of creating a clan for the coming months called isolation social support.  The idea is to have an environment where if people are struggling with current issues IRL they can have a place to go to vent their problems and seek support.   


Some of us are facing losing our jobs, not knowing how to pay our rent or mortgages, facing the grim prospects of older members of your family having a chance of dying if they contract this disease and all the other stressful things that have happened with this worldwide problem.   


There are no requirements to the clan other than being nice to each other.  I've made the CC L4Y for now I have an account isolation cc I'll put members on to make it easier to remember if people like this idea.   


If this sounds like an idea you can get behind, please let me know.  I am happy to exp waste if it means I can help somebody struggling right now.

2. I am training Strength at Ammonite Crabs, is this the best place?
3. Where is the best place to train Ranged with a Cannon? I see there are lots of new spots
4. What is the best Ranged training weapon? I heard blowpipe is good?
5. Can 15 prayer accounts get a fire cape?
6. I heard pures cannot get Addy Gloves, are mith gloves worth getting?
7. I am 55 slayer on my account, I heard Granite Hammer is better than Leaf-Bladed Sword, I'm guessing I would just use Leaf-Bladed for pking as it is much cheaper?
8. Are there any news quests useful for pures? All I know is that DT and RFD used to be good to do, and MM if 60atk

Once everybody figured out what account builds were optimal though, the right build became a NECESSARY ENTRY BARRIER to getting into pvp at all, because if you didn't have a pvp build the people who did would just wipe the floor with you. Make a proper pvp account first, and THEN you can start pvp.

That's the reason nobody pvps - starting in pvp at all requires you to build an entire account just to pvp on.

Nobody can pvp without creating a whole new account dedicated to it. That's the problem.

How is anybody supposed to get into pure pking if they have to spend hours and hours building up a brand new account just to find out if they'll even enjoy it or not?

On its surface runescape doesn't appear to have character classes, but when you pvp it absolutely does.

You wouldn't need to build a new location or anything, but it would fit in well with most ideas I've seen. If you had something like this that matched you up with people based off kdr and combat level (maybe wealth too but this would probably punish wealth in a bad way); then hardcore pkrs, regular pkrs, and people learning to pk alike could have a motivating reason to try it out and do it. 

My biggest issue with this idea is that smurfing exists, which could ruin it for newcomer. Maybe other factors could be looked at to fix this but I can't think of a fair way to avoid the problem. Maybe a gold lost variable? Hard to make it expensive to abuse but cheap to use.

fs6wrt,Bungboy,Self-defeating - Is Nightmare’s loot design a mistake?,"I’ve seen a few people bring this idea up but I feel it hasn’t been discussed enough so I’d like to
bring up this topic again. As everyone is well aware by now, Nightmare doesn’t have any profitable drops besides its uniques. This design is doable in theory because the uniques could hold value due to sheer usefulness (see bandos armor/SGS/Z spear from GWD, T bow from raids, many raids 2 drops)..

But there’s a big problem: almost everything the Nightmare drops is only BIS at the boss itself, or has very limited uses.

The armor and mace: Can you think of anywhere you would use inquisitor besides for killing Nightmare? I can’t. It has low defense and a crush accuracy bonus, and negative stab and slash. The mace is a great weapon except besides at Nightmare, basilisk knights, and gargoyle tasks, you can do just fine with a rapier or blade of Saeldor. 

The staff and orbs: Staff without an orb is essentially a budget Kodai wand with less accuracy and no rune saving effect. Eldritch has very limited uses. Volatile orb is basically a magic damage AGS best suited to low level pures. What about harmonized orb? It’s definitelt strong. It’s good for 1. Nightmare pillars, 2. Zulrah, 3. CoX Olm hand. It does more damage than sanguinesti, but you sacrifice the healing effect and have to brew more. Worth 2B? You decide. 

In conclusion, we’re left with a boss in which it’s unique drops almost exclusively only serve to help you  kill same boss which you obtained them from, helping you obtain duplicates of the same item. It doesn’t drop anything else, so how long before people realize that the uniques (almost) only function is serve to help obtain more of them, and everything tanks to ~20% of the current prices? Only time will tell. Thoughts?",10,1585631331,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fs6wrt/selfdefeating_is_nightmares_loot_design_a_mistake/,2007scape,1

fs6rbb,OSRS_Puw,📿 Amulet of Zenyte - Amulet of Eternal Zenyte,"This suggestion should adhere to OSRS quite nicely substituting a new piece of jewelry that resembles the Amulet of Glory except it's made from Zenyte. Something OSRS has never implemented was an amulet that uses teleports for Onyx + Zenyte Jewelry. This amulet would have the stats of a Fury and it's own unique teleports.

Requirements to make the Amulet of Zenyte? 89 crafting

What type of teleports will the Amulet of Zenyte provide? Teleport to MM2 Dungeon, Teleport to Ape Atoll and lastly a teleport to Demonic Gorilla Cave Entrance

How to obtain the Amulet of Eternal Zenyte? Players must bring an uncharged Amulet of Zenyte to the Fountain of Rune and charge it.

Instead of the normal rate of 1 in 25,000 for Amulet of Eternal Glory.. it will be a **1 in 100** rate chance when recharging. Players will likely only be able to charge 1-4 amulets at a time due to how rare they will be.

The Amulet of Eternal Zenyte will have the exact same stats as a normal Amulet of Zenyte except with unlimited teleport charges.

fs6eft,DjBetes,PLEASE READ BH/PVP IDEA,"These are just a few ideas I have. 

For BH would it be possible to have Tear targets so lets say there is a risk bracket if you risked 500k-750k then you only received targets in your respected risk range I feel that this could reduce the number of people who go into the wildy to rag, and force people to risk more in order to fight some who risks lets say 10m. In order for you to have a chance to kill that man with 10m you need to risking the equivalent amount give or take a few 100k.  Or when you killed someone who was risking like 2m and you only risked 500k and if you killed said person with 2m then all you would get is the money that was equivalent to your risk which was 500k, and the different of 1.5m would disappear and not be able to be recovered by the person who died with it only thing the person would keep is a damaged version of there item like a fighter torso. This would create and money/item sink which would get rid of items. Un-tradeables 

Other idea... I know it will sound ridiculous but what if there was an OSRS battle royal version. I know that LMS is a version of this, but this would require you to actually risk and use your own gear. It could encourage team pking or whatever you would like to call it. There could be rewards that are specific to the game these items wouldn't be trade-able, and there would be a cash prize from each time to buy into the game lets say its 250k per person. You would supply your own gear, and I guess a thought would be if you were to die then all items are lost on death except untradeables there would be a +1 item of course would be help in specific areas of the wilderness almost like an instanced zone which idk how hard that would be for the engine work. This is a very rough idea I guess and its just a thought. I understand if it seems out landish but it was just something that came into my mind. I think LMS could be removed as it provides too much reward for no risk at all especially when it generates GP into the game like it does not at an alarming rate but still brings in GP nonetheless and can be abused. Lets be honest is just a damn take on the ""hunger games""

fs4rap,willis512tx,Now my account dissapeared...,"UPDATE: JMOD PLZ 😭

UPDATE: Unlinked gmail and tried to relink it now i cant log into my account 🤦‍♂️ i tried using forgot password but it wont work. I clearly changed my password on my account (i didnt forget the pw i know it) but it still would only let me log in with the gmail button on mobile. Now that gmail is unlinked is my account gone forever?

Created an account using the gmail button, but i CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME log on to this gmail connected account on osrs desktop launcher. before you ask...

i have succesfully reset my password both through the oldschool website on desktop aswell as on mobile while logged into said email. both times while logged in (on both desktop and mobile) i can clearly see under account settings&gt;change name , that i am on illis512tx, confirming it is connected to this email. HOWEVER, as soon as i type out the email in the login box instead of the gmail button (like on mobile, though it does the same on mobile if logging in without clicking the g button) it takes me to tutorial island and wants me to make a new account.

why would it say this account is connected to this email (even says the email while logged in on mobile if i click the man with gear) if i cant use it logging in on desktop without the gmail button?

​

TL;DR: Gmail account you use with the G button to login on mobile is NOT connected to that account you play with on mobile, even though it may show up in account settings while logged in. im assuming you have to change the email though it said i was not allowed to when i tried (im assuming from spamming different recovery options for 30 minutes trying to play this stupid game &lt;3)",2,1585622085,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fs4rap/now_my_account_dissapeared/,2007scape,1
fs4oo5,MTaha211,Account Hijacking,"so does anyone else receive these kind of emails all the time randomly?

So far nothing has happened since but now here we are again, another dodgy email, i'm worried because they somehow managed to get my account's password the first time even though i didnt enter them in a phishing website or anywhere other than the game client. Do i ignore them from now on or is there anything else i can do to be safe? (i already have bank pin and auth setup)

Moved on to Vorkath next and got the pet at 285KC (Also rounded off to 300).

Right now, I'm grinding in an area where they are a lot of players. The area is for Ammonite Crab, which is a multi combat area. As you pros already know, there are some ""spots"" where they will auto aggro you until they de-aggro. 

**So I just have one question in mind honestly. Is it consider disruptive behavior to attack what someone else is already attacking?** 

I'm assuming that it's okay? Because the players chooses to go into multi-combat area, so it's only natural to expect 2 or more players to attack the same target, or 2 or more monsters to attack the same player.

Right now, I just been hopping world to find an open space. Which seems like the right thing to do and I don't mind it. 

But still, I want to know the answer for future reference and for the sake of knowledge.

Please wait a few minutes and try again” on a daily basis for probably a good portion of the past month now, prior to that this wasn’t a problem. This will happen once to multiple times a day, and seems to pick and choose when it wants to be nice and only do it once or sometimes I legit cannot log onto OSRS for an entire day. 

I have seen multiple reddit/forum posts about this happening to others, so clearly this is an ongoing problem and has been happening since before the server shit show that started a few days ago. Yes- I have reported it multiple times to Jagex and done the recommended solutions such as clearing DNS cache and waiting 2 and a half hours- I have tried it all. None of it works 100% effectively. Sometimes waiting an extended period of time works and then I can login again, but sometimes this error persists for two-three DAYS. Two to three days where I can not login to the game I pay $11/month for.. absolutely ridiculous. I did not know where else to come since reporting it doesn’t work and I don’t use twitter, so I am hoping reddit can help a jmod see this. 

Clearly I am not the only one with this problem, based on the influx of other posts regarding this issue, so I feel like this should be something that needs to be looked into; considering that customers are legitimately being denied access to the product they pay to use. I really cannot stress enough how annoying it is to come back home after a full day of work and be denied the 1 thing I am trying to do with my free time..",2,1585613748,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fs2k3t/too_many_login_attempts/,2007scape,1

Today 4 Lure try's happened. Its easy to reproduce, get your best gear out, stay at GE, or log in at COX in pvp world. Those guys have bots waiting for you.

I wonder when Jagex do finally fix this or start at least mute those ""lure"" try where the kids try hardly to bash on you to make them trade.

I had a dream where Hey Jase had the opportunity to reach 200m ahead of Lynx Titan. Everyone was worried that order would be disrupted, but Hey Jase calculated how to reach 199,999,999 exp and he waited there, intentionally waiting for Lynx Titan to reach 200m so he could surpass him and reach 200m first.

Then, when Lynx Titan was approaching 200m, he stopped at 199,999,998 exp, preserving Hey Jase's lead, and encouraging him to go for 200m exp first, thus changing rankings, but in the most respectable way possible.

This dream brought me happiness and honestly it's something I could see happening and it's something that shows the best in people, and in Runescapers.

I literally was PKing at the bandit camp, and I go to switch worlds. I then receive  


""Too many login attempts.

Please wait a few minutes before trying again.""

So I wait a little bit. Then I try again, several times, same thing. I ask my friend if I am logged in, he says no. I go to reset my password TWICE and it accepts it, but I immediately try to log into the website and it says incorrect password. I still cannot log in on either the website or on the game and I've waited in increments of several minutes each time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really worried that my account has been hi-jacked, because I have an extreme sense of security (2FA authenticator, different password from email to RS acct, 2FA into my email account, etc).

i have succesfully reset my password both through the oldschool website on desktop aswell as on mobile while logged into said email. both times while logged in (on both desktop and mobile) i can clearly see under account settings&gt;change name , that i am on illis512tx, confirming it is connected to this email. HOWEVER, as soon as i type out the email in the login box instead of the gmail button (like on mobile, though it does the same on mobile if logging in without clicking the g button) it takes me to tutorial island and wants me to make a new account.

why would it say this account is connected to this email (even says the email while logged in on mobile if i click the man with gear) if i cant use it logging in on desktop without the gmail button?

​

TL;DR: Gmail account you use with the G button to login on mobile is NOT connected to that account you play with on mobile, even though it may show up in account settings while logged in. im assuming you have to change the email though it said i was not allowed to when i tried (im assuming from spamming different recovery options for 30 minutes trying to play this stupid game &lt;3)",0,1585603485,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/frzlcr/osrs_mobile_to_desktop_question/,2007scape,1

Got my range up to 72 and am still grinding but last night I gave KBD a try and did 3 runs with 2-3 kills per run. It was so much more fun than I thought it would be. I don’t really have any irl friends that play but I’d really like someone to show me the ropes and maybe help me take on harder bosses as I progress.

I found the minigame clan chat not very helpful, so I started a Clan Chat and anyone that wants to host can join and we'll figure out what world(s) we can start to centralize to help out everyone.  

I'll have a test House Party CC under (OS Itchi). I'm open to any ""constructive"" ideas so we can help out other players that need access to a decked out POH.

Jagex, how long is later? I would like to know so I can reset my authenticator and get playing.

frxelp,Androneda,I want to give my sincerest thanks to this community for all the positivity and hope it has brought me. The little conversations in this game mean everything to me.,"I haven't played OSRS, my most cherished game, since late 2018. I quit due to personal reasons and burnout after playing for multiple hours a day for months. Since this pandemic starting raging throughout the world I have felt a primal calling...like OSRS is calling me home to the place that first enraptured me back in 2005. I believe I'm feeling this because OSRS gave me relationships and great interactions with people, more so than I could get in the outside world.

No matter how much goes by I always know in the deepest part of my being that Runescape is my home away from home. When I play I can explore the same places I first visited 15 years ago. I can talk to the community as if they are long lost friends. I can bond with almost anybody I encounter because of our common interests. I have met countless people struggling with the same issues I have: depression, anxiety, loneliness, lack of a true purpose and compass in life. And I have happily been there as a friend for people who had it far worse than me and for who I knew needed a friend.

Over the years I have relied on Runescape for emotional stability for one reason or another. If I had a particularly hard day, or felt like I didn't belong anywhere, I knew I belonged on RS and so that gave me the drive to push through to the end of the day and get home. I could log in and talk to any of friends about anything, and my favorite past time since 2005 has been to just fish at Catherby/Piscatoris and talk...that's right, just talk, because as insignificant some conversations may seem on RS, they are massive to me when my anxiety makes me feel like I can't talk to anybody in real life.

The social aspect of Runescape means everything to me, and without it I don't think I would be as optimistic as I am today. Runescape anchored me and gave me a reprieve from it all, from the onslaught of expectations and judgments from the people I encounter from day to day. I have been around others but felt lonely for so many years I can't even remember when it began. Runescape helped remind me that there are good people out there, and plenty who understand what it's like to live crippled by depression.

The pandemic has given me a new perspective. It made me remember to call my loved ones more often and cherish the small moments, the laughter and joy in my life. I have taken my whole family and life for granted for at least the last decade. I have lived comfortably and in safety not understanding how fortunate that made me. Loneliness is taking a serious toll on me now more than ever because I don't have the option to talk to people due to the global crisis.

I hope Runescape has brought as much meaning and happiness to others in this great community as it has for me. Thanks to everybody on this game who takes the time to talk to others who may really need that little conversation to keep going. I plan to start playing again very soon. I'll probably just fish monkfish in Piscatoris and talk to everybody, because it warms my heart that much. Finally, what ever part of the world you live in, please take care of yourself and your loved ones. 💖",1,1585596488,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/frxelp/i_want_to_give_my_sincerest_thanks_to_this/,2007scape,1

Void risk with glory and black dhide shield which is majority of rigour accounts - 200K risk

fru9fw,EntropyTF2,Clue Scrolls - Are Wilderness steps an appropriate way to make the scrolls harder?,"I'll start off with a short rant then pose two questions. It seems to me the wilderness steps in most clues are both entirely too common and also a ridiculous thing to have implemented for a primarily PVM reward. Every time I get a wilderness step I drop the clue. I have no interest in dealing with PKer's and the wilderness in general. In my opinion, the clues should scale their difficulty with quest, skill, and gear requirements. Adding the wildy to that mix makes it a clusterfuck and not enjoyable at all for me. It is the most frustrating thing in the world to do 5 steps on a hard clue to be told I need to go to the wildy. Rant over, here are my two questions:

1: Do you feel the same way about wilderness steps? How often do you drop these vs. completing them? I'll generally do wildy steps for elite/master clues but it's way too much hassle for hard clues.

2: What do you think about separating normal clues vs. wildy clues like slayer? I think this has the potential to bring a new facet to the wildy for people who enjoy that kind of thing (not me).",43,1585586655,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fru9fw/clue_scrolls_are_wilderness_steps_an_appropriate/,2007scape,1

You can restart your router and hope that works, or call your isp.

What I did was download the NordVPN 30 day money back guarantee then opened live chat and got a refund immediately. I gave some bs about how I'm trailing different VPNs.

frsmkw,Enebablock,Loyalty to something,"So, I am Eneba from Lithuania, my English is not good, but i will try to explain whats happend.

I  played Runescape from long ago, for different accounts, now i played  for one account long period. Its true on this account 2 times I used  Hotkeys and Tablet for faster exp rates, but this is not illegal now.

When  i was blocked 2 time i decided not use these things until Jagex confirm  that it is legal. So when it become legal i used RuneLite until now.

So the point is I get DISABLED PERM for grinding to long, to trying to earn millions, to achieve quests, to play game...

Today  in the morning i couldnt access my account now it is disabled for  macroing.  For macroing? Really? Grinding all day is a macroing? Doing  quest it is macroing? Using RuneLite is macroing?

Its  hard to explain when this is not my main language, but its harder to  think that all these hours playing Runescape was erased. Iam very  interested to know how games macroing searching system works, if loyal  LOYAL players who did bad things earlier, learned from that and tryed to  play honestly getting wiped for no REASON - Sorry for grinding all day  long :)

frsap5,BallsyPalsy,"Trying to figure out ""too many login attempts""","In an effort to maximize hops without getting locked out, I've been keeping meticulous track of login time and number of login attempts. The goal is to approach login limit then do another activity that doesn't involve hopping. Here's what I have so far:

3/29 test: 57 successful logins over 1.5h span, 58th triggered login limit. ~10 minutes later logged in 1 more time, then locked out until 3.5h after first login. 5 more hops before hitting limit for another hour. Total time to cooldown = 4.5h

3/30 test: 56 successful logins over 2h span, 57th triggered login limit. Still unable to log back in 2h20m after initial login.

It's strange that today I got fewer logins in addition to a longer cooldown period. Maybe there is a small element of randomness to prevent hopping bots from figuring things out.

Still, it looks like one can play it safe and hop 50-55 times every 4.5h without running into limits. 

My tests were done while training construction with limestone, so I wasn't hopping as fast as other activities such as shop-buying or world scouting.

frr23d,wealldie1day,Don't re-introduce the bounty hunter tasks and hot spots,"They were annoying. They didn't enhance the PvP experience for genuine pkers and caused the activity to be riddled with boosting accounts and bots you had to skip just to find a genuine target. The hot spots were almost never useful and no one is going to break up their fight just north of edge or at 44s to move to a hot spot to fight. Scrap the tasks and hotspots. Think of something else if you really must have a mechanic.

Potentially, depending on their risked wealth. But the majority of us aren't hunting these players on bh worlds. It'd also make bot farms risk more and buff baby pure pking.

i have succesfully reset my password both through the oldschool website on desktop aswell as on mobile while logged into said email. both times while logged in (on both desktop and mobile) i can clearly see under account settings&gt;change name , that i am on willis512tx, confirming it is connected to this email. HOWEVER, as soon as i type out the email in the login box instead of the gmail button (like on mobile, though it does the same on mobile if logging in without clicking the g button) it takes me to tutorial island and wants me to make a new account. 

why would it say this account is connected to this email (even says the email while logged in on mobile if i click the man with gear) if i cant use it logging in on desktop without the gmail button? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Gmail account you use with the G button to login on mobile is NOT connected to that account you play with on mobile, even though it may show up in account settings while logged in. im assuming you have to change the email though it said i was not allowed to when i tried (im assuming from spamming different recovery options for 30 minutes trying to play this stupid game &lt;3)",7,1585563655,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fro84f/huge_osrs_mobile_issue/,2007scape,1

After eight years, I've decided to come back to Runescape, but I can't decide between the two versions, and I'd love some insightsfrom you guys. Even though there is a lot of nostalgia and a great sense of achievement, OSRS's combat feels sluggish and the grinding seems tedious. RS3's EoC, its cosmetics and MTX feels out of place for me though. Given that, in between college, work, and the occasional other game, I won't have extremely much time on my hands, what do you think will be best, OSRS or RS3?

Hey!

I first played runescape back in 2008-2009, and continued to play until late 2011.

Now I never bought membership, as I thought that f2p was sufficient for my gaming needs. And to be honest, it was. The game was, and still is, one of my favourite nostalgic memories.

Cue 2020 and an apocalypse. The current situation means that I've got a lot of time on my hands. And I wanted to come back. When I was 14 at 2011, I had no money to put into the membership, but now it's different.

I bought three months of membership, thus far I've only thieved and fletched, but otherwise been entirely on the f2p side.

Quarantine got me itching to play again, I’ve hardly done pvm on my account and was wanting to try it out again and have some fun. I watch some videos considering my options on what to do. Every video I watched had a top comment relating to people getting rekt at revs. So I say fuck it i wanted to do revs, I had higher hopes than all the people in the comments. For the very first time im gonna do revs, I gear up and head out to the cave. I walk in slowly, I’m exploring it feels like I’m playing rs2 all over again and not knowing what to do. I click attack on a rev and start to kill my first one. I notice there is no body else in the cave so I was thinking this would be more relaxing than what people have said.... All of a sudden I start hearing magic spells being casted but I’m using ranged attacks so I thought it was something else. Boom I’m tele blocked, I look and see 4 guys standing around me, boom I’m ice barraged, my hands sweating not knowing what to do, boom I’m AGSd, BOOM IM DEAD. And all I see on my screen is a “sit bot” I stand up from my chair accepting that I got boomed. I went upstairs and opened my fridge and cracked open a couple oduls. Next thing you know I’m 14 oduls deep and 4 heneiken zero deep, I’m buzzed off my ass. I decide to give it another go.  I hop to a different world gear up. Walk in... I get a rev kill I was pumped. Then the same group spawns in and BOOMS me again.

When I did that I ran into a guy just one hitting the cows, ignoring the cowhide, and moving onto the next one while it took me 30 secs to kill one. We began to talk and he gave me black helmet and platebody with gold trim which was about 300k after I sold the 2 and I was estatic. I looked up the optimal quest guide, bought a membership, and I rushed through waterfall quest, did tree gnome village and now I made it to holy grail. While I was traveling to Ge, I ran into a lvl 30 account just cutting oaks by Varrock castle and we began to chat and he gave me 1 mil. I’m not trying to boast about being handed this money bc in all honesty i like earning it more but what I’m trying to get at is this community is the best out of all gaming communities I’ve been involved with.

These bots are totally predictable, following the exact same paths every time, pause for the same amount of time in between actions, and run for hours a day. In about 5 days I’ve seen one go from 45-&gt;75 runecrafting, which is worth about 120,000 mud runes or 36 million gold at 300 gp each. 

The price of mud runes, a relatively rare and valuable rune for certain spells, is tanking, down to 280 from 360 just a few weeks ago.

I have reported these bots, but hiscores shows they are still churning out hundreds of thousands of mud runes. The bots are so simple and predictable, how can I reach out to Jagex about them?

frdpuc,IsThisDestiny,Enclosed are screenshots of an android app I have been developing - 'Max Trackr'. Just want to gauge opinions and see if this is something people want to use.," [https://imgur.com/a/kuIDmbg](https://imgur.com/a/kuIDmbg) 

Few things to note - the exp bars are animated. In the second picture the bars will eventually fill up in color with the percentage completion of level. At some point it will be animated, with nice graphics. I want to achieve the feel of a potion brewing up in a vial, aesthetically. 

I want the app to be niche in that knowledge of the most efficient methods of levelling should be hard-coded. By that I mean, without having to look up a guide and simply by checking your level I should be able to prescribe you two or three methods (say 2 ticking teaks) and explanations on how to achieve the best rates using those methods. 

Eventually, I want to have the exp bars encrust with gold / platinum / what have you at certain milestones like 99, 120, and 200m, and yes, I am approaching this with the knowledge that the primary userbase will be maxed players or aspiring max players, and this includes exp past 99. This is reflected in the coding - my app recognizes what certain EXP breakpoints symbolize by design. 

Any thoughts, comments, questions, or concerns are appreciated. The app does not and will never have ads of any sort. I plan to sell it for 99 cents but I might lean $1.99 or free depending on how much time investment goes into it.

frckjt,WalkinSteveHawkin,Does someone have to attempt a login with the correct password to trigger a locked account?,"So I got a password reset request from Jagex earlier this morning.  I didn’t request it, so I figured it was spam, deleted the email, and didn’t think on it again.  I tried logging in on mobile a few hours ago and got the account locked message.  I scanned my computer (which came up clean), changed my password, and set up a brand new email just for OSRS.  

I’m concerned because my email is secured with 2FA that I have to allow via a push notification from my phone (not via sms code or authenticator), and I never got any sort of login request to my email. 

I also don’t use my email to login to my account.   It still uses the username and is way different than the display name.  

So did someone have to actually get into my email and change my password for the account to get locked, or can it be locked solely from a dodgy password reset request?",2,1585513352,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/frckjt/does_someone_have_to_attempt_a_login_with_the/,2007scape,2

frcgax,TheKnewNite,1v1 One Bond Tournament on Tuesday.,"Hi. I'm going to be organizing a 1v1 tournament on Tuesday at 1500 PST | 1800 EST | 2200 GMT | 0100 MSK | 0600 HKT | 0900 AEDT. The eventual winner of the tournament will be given a bond as a prize. All equipment will be provided, in fact outside equipment is banned. The tournament is completely free to enter and there are no restrictions on the accounts participating. We'll be hosting the entire thing on a f2p server. If you want to join as a level three fresh off tutorial island, that's your perogative. If you want to join as a maxed main, that's also allowed. Does this mean maxed mains have an advantage? Absolutely. But I want to keep everything as simple as possible. If this is a successful event maybe we'll see people trying to win the tournament at the lowest possible combat levels. Maybe we'll split off combat brackets and award more bonds.

Signups are on the Discord I've created which also holds a LOT more information as well as the original reddit post I attempted to make. I've changed the reward to a bond as it's completely in game and roughly equivalent to $10. If anyone has any questions or would like more information feel free to reach out to me here on the thread, in pms, or on the Discord.

IGN: TheKnewNite if you'd like to message me. I'll keep private on for the next couple days.",1,1585512934,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/frcgax/1v1_one_bond_tournament_on_tuesday/,2007scape,1

So a big up to the Mod team for creating this quest, it felt really great overall as if I was playing a storymode. From the animations, to the models, to the dialogue, to the tasks, to even the music, it just felt awesome as a whole. The Seren fight was really epic too and Seren looked amazing. It's as much an achievement for them for writing this, as it is for me finally completing it. The music upon entering Priffdinas on quest completion felt like the perfect little final touch, just the ""peace, at last"" feeling it gives.

Much respect for the mods, I can't wait to see what's in store for the future, thank you for the awesome work!

Trust me you can do it, runescape isnt the place bro.

Sure, but ive dated real gamer chicks and a real gamer chick who is into gaming has a lot of the same habits as you. Not very attractive irl. I mean sure you could find a qt pie gamer gf whos not overweight or doesnt have poor hygiene and knows how to cook etc. The chances of finding that on runescape? Hahahahaha

Let me put this into perspective youll understand hopefully.

Your drop rate of finding a girlfriend on runescape who is 1/10 overweight and who will actually fuck you irl is probably around 1/100,000+

fr9iaa,loffredom,"I think many monsters and bosses in the game needs drop table improvements/re balancing, so I made a drop table creator on google sheets.","(link at the bottom) 

Just as the title states. I think that many of the drop tables in the game need to be reworked. Many boss and monster drops are too consistent and a lot are either over/under tuned for their level with way too many resource drops. Adding battle staff and rune items to half the monster drop tables to increase the gp/hr is very underwhelming.

I'm a huge fan of the old school drop tables with less consistently good drops and bigger ticket drops making up most of the value of their drop table. By decreasing the consistent loot it makes the monster less desirable, thus making unique much more valuable and making the monster more desirable to kill.  It makes the game more exciting, less grindy, and way less combat oriented.

Some monsters that are too consistent: Zulrah, Vorkath, Abyssal Sire, Hydra, Gargoyles, Dust Devils,  Skeletal Wyverns, Brutal Black Dragons, Grotesque Guardians.

Some monsters that need buffs: Black Demons, Kalphites, Hellhounds, Zygomites, Suqahs.

Some monsters that have ideal drop tables: GWD Bosses, Cerberus, Dagganoth Kings, Bloodvelds, Cave horror, Dark Beasts, Abyssal Demons. 

Things to note: 

I think this needs to be implemented with a skilling overhaul. to offset the decrease of resources coming into the game from drops.

The nerfs/buffs vary based on the monsters current drop table (some monsters many only need slight buffs/nerfs)

It's not necessarily the gp/hr that's bad for these monsters, it's how you get that gp/hr which is why some monsters I put down may not make sense (like Grotesque Guardians)

Some monsters offer others incentives to kill other than loot, I get that. ( like good xp/hr)

I'd like to hear your opinions on certain monsters that need reworks.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway here's a google sheets document I made to create your own drop table. You can also use this to make new monsters and new drop tables if you want. I'm not an excel whiz so it's pretty basic, but I'd like to make it more in depth and add new features. (If you know how to, feel free to copy and edit it, or message me and I can do it). I'd like to add color to the drop percentages, a drop down list for items and monsters, and a way for it to auto sort if they percentages are out of order). 

Here's an example of a revised Zulrah drop table I made. I plan to edit and update this frequently with more drop tables:

That is why i chose to make this post to ask the reddit osrs-community about:

\- Their experinces with touch on laptop.

\- If anyone knows if there ever will be a osrs-client for laptop made for touchscreen.

\- Is it possible to install and use the mobile app on windows through some emulator?

(I dont know how to make a text post with image so hi o,o)

Little background: I have been playing Runescape since I was I think 9? I am now 23 o.o (Too old, help me reverse it please q.q) Anyways, I spent MANY years just skilling. Coming back from school or work and just cutting trees or fishing for relaxed playing. But I have been on a goal for about 2 years, off and on, for a quest cape. I have 5 quests left and rarely ever did anything pvm or combat related. 

So I recently started DQ2 and the Vorkath fight was KICKING MY BUTT! After a few failed runs I met a new friend outside his arena thing. He helped me SO much!

I was stupid and kept running on his barrage phase and i didn't know you had to walk for it to make it easier. He just gave me so many tips for it and I am so greatful for it! 

Just learning the mechanics of the fight was incredibly fun. Sure I died like 12 times, but every time it was a moment of ""Okay, so don't do that..."" or ""Ohhh, so that's how you avoid it and that's the color of fire for prayer disable!""

This fight really turned fun after I started to understand it all. It gave me a new view on this game and really helped to bring back the excitement in it. I actually was shaking when i killed him! It has been years since a game made me feel this accomplished honestly, and this is why I always come back to Runescape! It may be called a kids game by the filthy casuals, but I wanna see them do these fights! (Damn them casuals)

But long story short: I am a noob, hi. I fricken LOVE this game still. I have huge respect for the people that do these fights so easily. And, if you see this friend that helped me, THANK YOU SO MUCH. You were such an amazing help!

I don't care how much people say this community is toxic, there will always be those amazing people to help idiots like me keep going! And for all those idiots, we thank you guys (or gals)!

Okay, I think I have word vomited enough... Just super excited. It's early morning and I am filled with coffee, so time to finish this quest! :D 

Hope you all have a wonderful day if you read this and get this far into the post o.o",17,1585495392,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fr7iav/i_know_this_is_small_but_i_am_so_happy_right_now/,2007scape,1

Stats: 99 range,94 mage, 99 hp, 90 att/str/def

My gear is slayer helm, karils top and bottom, d boots, b gloves, blessing, fury, ros(i), arclight and crystal shield. I’ll also use dragon warhammer to spec and master wand for healing with blood barrage in between kills.

I can comfortably flick and heal of minions to max in between kills however I feel that the limiting factor for me is dps. I noticed when I land my dwh specs I’m killing him so fast and potentially using just 1 shark. Got me thinking if i should be focusing more on dps trying to get more consistent dwh specs.

Then i removed the attas seed (Use spade on the anime patch) and put on kronos. My yield was increased to 75 give or take. 

Then i reput attas seed and i was back at 80 herbs per run. 

This basically means that for some reason the second attas seed i used cause the bug to drop the yield to 70% and i needed to basically reset the anima seed. 

I am doing minimum 7-8 herb runs per day.",6,1585483155,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fr4u4f/theory_on_attas_plantherb_bug/,2007scape,1

I suddenly got an urge to train woodcutting in OSRS. I had my credit card ready to login and buy a bond. I tried login into my account I hadn't logged in in MONTHS and it was banned. Ok? Maybe I can appeal or something. I went into the support page and it asked for an authenticator. I didn't remember setting it up. Turns out I got banned for hacking a WEEK ago.

I disabled the authenticator and tried appealing the ban. I'm not expecting it to be lifted but wtf Jagex. How the fuck can someone set up an authenticator for my account and you don't even notify me via email to check it out immediately.

Are there no IP checks? You do store the last connection IP, are your devs so mediocre you can't see up a check whenever a new IP logs into the account and ask for verification?

Is there a way I can at least un-link my email so I don't have to make a new one JUST to play OSRS? I don't mind starting from 0, but I'd rather recover my account. If that can't be done at LEAST I'd like to link a fresh account to my main e-mail.

fr2ubs,Vii74LiTy,The Jerry of money makers,"So to preface, I wanna be vague about what I'm merching, so as to keep it viable if this post was to somehow get more than 4 upvotes. What I will say is that it's high volume flipping.

Most of you know the, buy high, sell low trick to check an items margins, well I did this for a high volume item like 2 weeks ago, crazy margin, like more than double the price in buy vs sell. Someone was buying a lot, no matter the cost apparently. Well I hopped on that gravy train and make a pretty penny.

After that went so well, I decided to try it again, I bought at the low price, and set the sell for pretty much double, slightly less than last time, but still a ridiculous margin. Not long after, I check the margins again, and they had normalized again, fine, but I still had my sell offer in for the hilariously high price, but I was like, wth, in going to bed, well see what happens. It sold lol

So I bought more, put them in for nearly double what I bought them for, a day later, they sell again!

I feel like Jerry crawling home from the alien invasion episode and Beth asks him how he survived.

I just keep buying these things and selling them for stupid prices. And it keeps working. Blowing all my hard work of making unfinished potions, blast furnace money making out of the water.

fr2t5i,VictorPumpenstein,Verdict on Barrows for money-making?,"I keep seeing conflicting opinions on running barrows for money-making. 

Some people say it isn’t worth it without hard Morytania but then people turn right around and say you should be doing more efficient things for money if you have the stats for hard Morytania. 

I was hoping to get my ranged up and run barrows since I’m on mobile and the more involved PvM is pretty much beyond me. But I can’t seem to nail down whether it’s the right option or not. 

I’ve done a couple runs already and I’m either breaking even on each run because I’m using too many prayer pots or just barely profiting. Spending too much time on ahrim thus needing to level ranged.

I'm looking for any information on where I should start wildy pking and what kind of gear I should be using. I have competed desert treasure so I do have access to that spell book.

fqys9k,Sir_RS,‘Chivalry’ prayer back to Life!,"So, to start, this has been quite a topic for our Zerk community and Many other communties for a very long time. The overall consensus is that Chivalry is a dead-content prayer in Old School Runescape. New players, mostly ironman accounts, use this prayer(if even) until they reach the higher tier prayer ‘Piety,’ thus leaving chivalry in the dust FOREVER.

Chivalry
1. the medieval knightly system with its religious, moral, and social code.
2. the combination of qualities expected of an ideal knight, especially courage, honor, courtesy, justice, and a readiness to help the weak.

I personally believe it’s time we leap out of our comfort zone and take a look at a way to bring chivalry back into the game. Not only by Definition, but because it would be essential for closing some gaps in many pvp situations. For some time now there has been quite some neglect in the 1-45 defense pking brackets and there has to be a fair way to find a median. Yes, choosing 1-45 defense account is a choice, but its our lifestyle, just like Main fully maxed accounts. I think we should do a poll to get the defense requirement lowered for Chivalry and the questions on the poll should look something similar to this.

1. Should we lower defense requirement for Chivalry, thus giving other players an alternative prayer choice?

I believe that if the defense cap is fully lifted, then pure builds 1-20 wont find a reason to complain about it being too strong as well. For now though, there is a huge gap in pvp for non 70 defense accounts. They have way more gear and ability to overpower way too easily, leaving it not very fun for players PKing in general or players learning to PK. Please take the time to consider this as an option to improve Oldschool Runescape whenever considering PvP updates again! The chivalry prayer doesnt offer anymore than 3% bonus to what already exists, so why shouldnt we?",57,1585451709,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqys9k/chivalry_prayer_back_to_life/,2007scape,1

I’d prefer tasks that make money, I know I gotta do slayer and get a ton of skills up but I’m more looking for bosses or “activities” you guys were surprised to enjoy
Only bosses I’ve ever killed are zulrah, Vorkath,  the big spider in the wilderness and demonic gorillas if they counted 
I don’t have the stats for raids , I will one day but right now I could use some filler material, I grinded months to get to ds2 and I do not hate Vorkath but I think I need a break before I do

fqumfo,facetiouspeep,Sorceress's Labyrinth,"This suggestion is for a new minigame/boss. You can reach it by teleporting from the Sorceress's Apprentice in Al-Kharid, same as Sorceress's Garden. The apprentice is worried that the Sorceress has unlocked a potent new power that could threaten the world and wants you and a group of friends to investigate.

Players: This can be done solo (more difficult) or with up to 3 friends (so total of 4 players).

Requirements: None, but able to defeat many Level 110+ enemies and a Level 540 boss is required. Level 70 in Slayer, Agility, and Thieving will be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

**\~ The Labyrinth \~**

The labyrinth is a giant maze, with the Sorceress awaiting in the center. She is a Level 540 boss and is currently attuned to one of the four seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter) at random. More on that soon. In each of the four sectors of the maze (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest), the maze is themed after one of the four seasons.

If you try to attack the Sorceress at this point, the chatbox will inform you that she has a shield of &lt;insert attuned seasons here&gt; protecting her, and you need 100 Tokens of &lt;insert opposite season here&gt; to bring the shield down! Spring and Autumn are opposites, as are Summer and Winter.

Tokens are gained in one of 3 ways. Spread throughout the maze are Elementals of the corresponding season, so the Spring sector has Spring Elementals patrolling it. These are Level 110 enemies that can be defeated, and drop guaranteed Tokens of the matching season. There is also one Supreme Elemental (Level 225) in each sector which is harder and requires Level 70 Slayer to defeat but drops many more Tokens. Secondly, there are chests hidden in the alcoves and dead-ends of the maze. Many of these can be unlocked (with higher Thieving giving higher success rates) to give Tokens. There is also one gilded chest in each sector that gives more Tokens but requires Level 70 Thieving to unlock. Thirdly, some Tokens are just lying on the ground on the other side of Agility obstacles and can be picked up after navigating the obstacle. There is a large stack behind one of these, requiring Level 70 Agility to access.

As you navigate the maze, you'll also have to avoid traps, pass obstacles, and defeat Elementals which block movement around them.

""Use"" 100 of the appropriate Token on the Sorceress for her Shield to be taken down for 120 seconds (so you might need more if you can't kill her fast enough). Now, you can attack her! She attacks with all styles of the combat triangle, but Prayers work. Additionally, she has a special ability with each season she is attuned to. As Winter, she is able to freeze anyone she is attacking (or who is attacking her). As Summer, she is able to deal a bleed over time by burning you. As Spring, she is able to spawn flowers that resurrect her with 10% HP, so you must destroy the flowers she spawns. As Autumn, she is able to target a square with an exploding pumpkin and fill your screen with large leaves to inhibit vision; you must run away from the pumpkin (even if you can't see where) to avoid taking high damage.

After killing her the first time (she has 300 HP), she respawns, attuned to one of the remaining seasons. Repeat the process all four times to slay her.

**\~Rewards\~**

Slaying the Sorceress teleports you out of the Labyrinth back to Al-Kharid and gives you 1-100 Shards of &lt;Random Season&gt; (weighted towards 1-30 Shards). One Token of each season can be combined to create a Token of Seasons. Tokens of Seasons are tradeable. They can be used to purchase from the Apprentice's Shop. The Apprentice Shop sells two armor sets - the Solstice and Equinox armor sets. These are Level 72 armor sets that cost a total of 3500 Tokens each. They have identical stats, but different set effects. The Solstice set effect has a 5% chance per hit (this counts your hits AND opponent hits) to inflict a bleed effect on one of your opponents, dealing 2 damage every 6 seconds for 30 seconds. The Equinox set effect has a 0.5% per hit (this counts your hits AND opponent hits) to create a 20 HP shield for 60 seconds, where all damage you take will be subtracted from the shield instead until it is depleted; after 60 seconds or 20 damage has been taken, the shield dissipates. (It is shown as a secondary health bar over your character.)

All armor pieces from the Apprentice's Shop are untradeable to other players and on the GE. You can also Wager your Shards of each season in the Shop to be given supplies, gp, a Solstice or Equinox cat pet, or very rarely, one of the armor pieces.

Solstice and Equinox set effects can activate 1,000 times before they degrade, requiring 100 Shards of any one season or 10 Tokens of Seasons to recharge.",3,1585436243,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqumfo/sorceresss_labyrinth/,2007scape,1

fqtn82,GHouseSwag,Farmruns - Efficiency and Personal Strategy Questions,"Hey guys, I had a few questions about farmruns and now that I'm starting to get into farming and I've got a high enough level that I'm not unlocking things that are three times better halfway through the run, I was wondering about efficiency of using all the plots and the best routes to take. Ultimately, like every other training method in RuneScape, this comes down to how much you want to be efficient vs. what you enjoy doing the most. There's plenty of people that sacrifice XP for something more fun or easier than the max efficiency way says you should do it. I'm just curious as to what the community thinks about these runs and if there's a sweet spot I can find that's somewhere in the middle.

So before we get to my questions, here's a way-too-long rundown of my daily farmrun. (also that's a filthy lie I rarely do it every day it's more like tri-weekly.)

My current set-up takes me about half an hour to an hour to complete a run, based on how prepared for the run I am and whether or not my dumb brain forgets half the stuff I need (looking at you crystal teleport seed).

I start by gathering up all the teleports and saplings I need for the run. At the moment this consists of a mist battlestaff with lava and law runes, Ardy cape 1, combat bracelet, ring of wealth, ectophial, Xeric's talisman, skills necklace, crystal teleport seed, dragon axe and woodcutter outfit if I want the roots or not if I can't be bothered, yew and palm tree saplings, spade, and compost (bottomless bucket with highest level compost). Then I start teleporting around. I start with trees by going to Lumbridge, Varrock, Falador, Taverly and end with the stronghold, skipping the farming guild for now. Then I do the fruit tree at the stonghold and head to the village. Ardy to Brimhaven, then Camelot to Catherby, and finally crystal teleport seed to Lletya. Then I use a skills necklace to go to the farming guild and do the last two trees.

Next I do allotments. I start by using a Kharyll teleport to Canifis and west to the mushroom patch, then ectophial to the farming patches. Next I go to South Falador, Catherby, North Ardy, Hosidius, Harmony Island, and finally end again at the farming guild. (no access to prif yet)

I then finish off the specials. I plant an herb at Trollheim then dual arena teleport to plant a cactus, ending with a combat bracelet to champions guild to plant belladona at Draynor Manor. (If I have the inventory space at this point I'll try to bring the bush and hops for the two patches by the champions guild but sometimes I just can't be bothered and do it later.)

Finally before doing a birdhouse run I do hops and bushes at Yanille, seers village, and below the champions guild, hitting the first bush at the guild before teleporting to Ardy monastery, Etceteria, and Rimmington.

To start the birdhouse run I go back to the farming guild, do hespori if its ready, then gear up.

I bring a digsite pendant, 3 mahogany saplings if they're ready, hammer, chisel, and 4 of the best logs I can use with my hunter level, currently maple. I teleport to fossil island and use the mushrooms to get around, starting with verdant valley and finishing the birdhouses before dealing with the mahogany trees.

So as to the questions:

**Is it efficient time-wise to do every patch I can?** Obviously the more stuff you plant and harvest the more XP you get but some of it, especially the hops, reward very little XP compared to everything else and my main concern is time. I like to do farmruns in between slayer tasks but at the moment doing the full run takes a while so I wind up putting it off until the end of the night a lot.

**Since I'm not an ironman, should I just do trees and birdhouses?** Since I'm not actually using the things I get from farmruns and I'm just selling them, would it be better for my time if I just cut out everything but trees, fruit trees, and birdhouses? Obviously herbs can be really profitable at higher levels and could lose you a lot of money over time, but what about the flowers and bushes and hops? These crop types don't sell for near as much as everything else so I really feel like it's not worth the time.

**Finally, what does your farmrun look like?** Farmruns aren't typically shown in content creator's videos so I haven't seen what other people do. I'm curious to hear what your daily runs consist of to get an idea of what the average player does.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Note: I know this is a huge post that probably goes way to in-depth but if I'm going to be doing these runs until 99 I want to make sure I'm doing it efficiently. When I was looking up how to start doing this skill I never found any detailed guides on exact routes to take so I've just been making it up as I go. Now that I'm at almost 70 farming and the levels have slowed down I wanted to find out how to do this better and also help anyone else looking for a step-by-step guide that can't find one.",3,1585433000,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqtn82/farmruns_efficiency_and_personal_strategy/,2007scape,1

fqt6n3,soounreal,Potential group scout botting a series on Youtube and nothings being done,"The series i'm talking about is none other than [HCIM but PVP](https://youtu.be/XeasZxEsJzM). If you have never seen or heard of this series, C Engineer placed a bounty on his own head of 1 Bill GP for someone to kill him. He plays a pvp restricted HCIM. About 10-15 episodes ago, repeating accounts have been impossibly finding him wherever he goes. At first, people assumed it was luck or certain 3rd party plugins on the runelite software. Then talk about it went quiet. 

Two weeks ago, another youtuber released a very eye opening video about a unique scouting bot. This video covered lurers using a very quiet bot script to funnel instant information to a private discord. This video had nothing to do with C Engineer but the connections are obvious at this point. The video i'm talking about is [here.](https://youtu.be/-_1uCUboG5g).

Obviously, this is tinfoil hat talk since technically this can't be proven from the players side. However, hear me out... imagine how quiet this bot script is and isn't being placed on full blast by a popular youtuber. The non-youtubers walking around pvp and suddenly a clan brings them down in a secluded area that no one goes even in non-pvp worlds. Clearly you should only bring what you are willing to lose but in reality, that still doesn't make what's going on okay. How is stuff like this flying under the radar so consistantly?

fqstns,zeitgeist-addendum,Community Appreciation Post,"Hello fellow OSRS players,  
  
Just now, I was bankstanding on World 302. I was in a chatty mood and in a crowd of people I asked, ""How we doing guys?"".  
  
Someone replied and told me they just got scammed, lost 7 mil in cash and 10 mil in items. Having been in that position before, I sympathized with the lad and gave him 500K. It's not much, but it was something to help him get back on his feet.  
  
Now, this guy (RSN: ChronicBill) was super appreciative. That was lovely. Honestly, it could have been a sob story to rob someone of his money but I chose to believe him, solely because I had been scammed once before and when I told another RS player they immediately gave me some money to get me back on my feet, without doubting the integrity of my story.  
  
Here's the cherry on top: a higher-level player (Daily Champs) noticed our conversation and asked me: ""How much did you give him?"". When I told him I gave ChronicBill half a mil, he straight up sent me a trade offer and gave me back my 500K. I asked him why he would be so kind and he said, ""the community needs good people"".   
  
  
I loved that, and I love this part of our OSRS community. So therefore, I am writing this appreciation post. Guys, stay safe and stay lovely to eachother &lt;3",3,1585430395,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqstns/community_appreciation_post/,2007scape,0

I suspect that whoever hacked me has so much account information on this account already that every action on the account gets accepted by Jagex.

fqoqy7,pandorasclosedgate,Extremely long shot,"Hello! I hope this allowed but understand if not. I don't play runescape however I am looking for someone who was semi-active on here. He went by the name ""coolsarn"" on reddit I'm not sure about in runescape. We were friends here on reddit and today he deleted his account with barely any warning. I am hoping that someone here still has contact with him. I am hoping that he is alright. That's all that I ask is to know that he's alright. If he never wants to talk to me again I understand, we didn't get into a fight or anything but sometimes people grow apart as friends. 

I posted something similar to this in another runescape subreddit on another account, but this is an account I used to talk to him so I figured I would post from this one as well.

I know I'm essentially asking for a miracle but please if you have contact with him just let him know I'm looking for him and let me know if he's alright. Thank you for reading this!",2,1585417466,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqoqy7/extremely_long_shot/,2007scape,1

fqo6ap,AlexanderPhysics,OSRS mobile safety on public networks," 

So I wanted to make an alternate account to merch and make money for my main account. I was hoping to do this in quick minutes I got left, like on public transport or at my school during breaks. All within the Runescape rules of course, but here is my concern.

Let say some guy done something illegal, and got banned on my schools Wi-Fi network. According to the Runescape rules, my merch alt will likely get banned if I've also played on that same network. Also, if I transferred cash to my main from my alt, it would also get banned. Now, that is not something I want to happen of course.

So I was wondering, are there any preventative measures I can take to ensure both of my accounts safety on these public networks?",2,1585415628,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqo6ap/osrs_mobile_safety_on_public_networks/,2007scape,1

I've played OSRS off-on for some years now and are 82/92/85 and range/mage are both 85. I would really like to try out raids as I've enjoyed raids in other games, but I feel kinda intimidated by all the 126 guys in 2B+ gear making guides and what not on youtube, and also I don't believe I'm well enough geared (bank of 50m ish) to do raids as a solo player. 

So my question is, how can I get into raiding when i'm neither maxed or have amazing gear? Are the chill runs I can join? Should I expect being flamed for low stats / gear / bad knowledge if I join runs? Where do I find public runs?

Seriously, do you guys think they actually keep server space for 180,000+ players readily available? 

I’ll give you all an example, you’re looking at Reddit and because of a new post, a website goes viral, yes you would be able to view the website initially, however as more and more people are joining the website because of this post that went viral, the website can only handle so many requests per second, and it begins to fail because it is unable to handle the thousands of requests.

fql6ac,cdwwg,Skilling Pet Appearances!,"***Keep in mind that the photo was done in 5 minutes on paint. :)*** 

**The gist:**  
\- To introduce more variety to the appearances of skilling pets that are currently lacking in order to allow them to better encompass the skill that they're representing while still acknowledging the simplicity and recognizability that players are currently fine with for current pets. Example: Phoenix and firelighters, Chinchompa and various breeds, Rift Guardian and runes types, etc etc.   


**Some ideas:**  
\- **Rocky** can wear head-gear from certain thievable NPC's. Examples: Gnome hat, HAM hood, bandit headwear, etc etc.   
\- **Giant Squirrel** can wear a coloured cape with a symbol representing certain completed agility courses. Examples: Penguin agility course symbol, Werewolf Skullball symbol, Wilderness course symbol, etc etc.  
\- **Tangleroot** can be given farming items or undergo a metamorphosis to gain traits from certain types of trees or patch types. Examples: Flowers, fruit, spirit tree likeness, etc etc.   


[Rocky with a Gnome hat.](https://preview.redd.it/aekz2ajf9fp41.png?width=1132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=809e1bfa2c5cf5a25e52777accc3c2d61f6c2147)

While most of these appearances and forms would be free to all players that have the pets and would come with little to no requirements, as it is currently, I also do feel that it would be fun to have certain appearances or forms be **LIGHTLY locked** behind content that must be completed first. For example.. needing to have thieved from the appropriate NPC in order to unlock that particular headwear appearance for Rocky.

***(Another idea would be to add an easy quest line for pets, like Gertrude's Cat, that allow you to raise a dog, a bird, and maybe a reptile in place of a cat as a generic, simple pet that is very easily obtainable, growable, and recognizable.)***",6,1585405727,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fql6ac/skilling_pet_appearances/,2007scape,1

fqjexo,Seasonality-,Help with a pking account,"Hey all,

I know that this subject may very well be beat to death, and since the games been out so long it’s easy to say look! There’s a guide for that, however because of all the updates I thought perhaps there have been some fundamental changes to the way things are done, and as we all know the amount of time and planning that goes into a account I wanted to ask the more experienced players about it before I dove in.

First, I’d like to say I’ve never been a good pker. I’ve played the game since I was eight but took extensive breaks and always pvmed. So I want to get into it, I have a higher level med acc with barrows gloves and 75 att/def 83 str 90 range 80 mage, with a fire cape which can make decent money at demonics/slayer but I’ve been told for pking, even with veng it won’t be great. So I want to make a pure, I like the idea of a void ranger but have no idea if it’s still a good build or if torvestas videos on it can still be followed. 

I also know there’s been nerfs to gmaulers and so on, so is a 1 def high range 60 att and high strength still another go to? Not sure at the moment and any advice or a relevant link would help.. thanks everyone again for the input.",12,1585399047,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqjexo/help_with_a_pking_account/,2007scape,1

fqip9q,Bentoki,Give ironman mode back some integrity,"Back when the mode was added quite some time ago now inspired by youtube/twitch series of b0aty &amp; faux it was a really really challenging mode. If people did anything that was seen as  ' not within the spirit of ironman mode' they were deironed and in some cases banned. This also included popular streamers at the time. Currently today the meta for training slayer on an ironman account is to use alts, people are boosting themselves corp kills and there is still shops that you can sell items to to benefit yourself. Popular content creators literally pay clans to protect them while they grind the busted revs which are balanced around them being in the wilderness.

What happened to the Jagex of old? Did they just lose their balls and can't punish anyone for anything? I also don't understand how ok the community in general are with the whole thing. I really hope that at some point Jagex is able to introduce measures so that these things can't be abused by ironmen, and if people do something that is obviously against the spirit of the mode, they should have their status revoked. Would be really nice if they focused an iota of the attention they give to infernal capes to ironman mode, it's a joke.

I also don't want to hear the 'it's too late- it would be unfair for the people playing now' crap. It shouldn't be allowed, it having been abused previously isn't a reason to keep it ingame.

He thrust one finger inside her, crooking it and hitting her in the spot that turned her moans into one long, high-pitched orgasm.

fqg8oq,bballfan2222,Corrupted gauntlet is just seeming off....,"   Ok is something just flawed in the background of the Corrupted gauntlet? I am just not understanding why even with a full inventory of food and 2 tier 3 weapons I either barely finish off the boss or I completely run out of food because the weapons are just noodling most of the kill. To add to this yes i pray correctly, yes i use two tier 3 weapons, I am maxed melee, I use Rigour and Piety, and I go in with tier 1 armour pieces(full set). I can count to 4, and i switch on my 5th attack. Also currently at 126 kills in the corrupt gauntlet so no, this is not a matter of practice. I have the strategy down and prioritize my hits, they just are terrible here. 

   Side note there are still other bugs that I still don't see how they made out of QA. The fact that the tornadoes can lie about their position by 1 tile, or doing an attack can lock you on a tile  for 1 tic even if you spam click away to allow the tornados to catch up to you so you are 1 banged out does not make much sense. Not to mention the other bugs like getting attacked will stop you from filling up vials, or even if you are on a bad tic with a monster, you cannot fill up a vial with water at all. Dropping an item and then fishing will cause animation and sound to happen without any fishing happening as well as other issues with interruptions with your actions within the gauntlet that do not fix themselves until you spam click for a solid 3 seconds. 

  Mainly the whole inaccuracy you can have is just super frustrating. It is just rather annoying to spend 6-7 minutes running around this grid which sometimes is just annoying how rng the room layouts can be, to rush and hurry and gather all these supplies and get everything set up to spend 5 minutes doing the boss kill itself to slowly be cleared of the food from your inventory from the constant 10's you are barraged with followed by a flutter of 7's and 4's from your own tier 3 weapons. I mean how can you go from like 4 35+ hit to 9 zeros. It really feels like the weapons hit all or nothing, mainly huge hits or just a few 0-4's. I don't know it is just super frustrating to spend all this time over and over to just have terrible rng hits and then slowly be killed off to be rewarded with and adamant full helm....",41,1585384104,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqg8oq/corrupted_gauntlet_is_just_seeming_off/,2007scape,1

fqe1gm,tortillakingred,Why are cannons allowed in the Wilderness?,"I’ve been playing this game since pre 2007, and OSRS specifically since 2016. Can someone explain to me why cannons are allowed in the Wilderness? If there’s a good reason that I haven’t heard about then tell me, but it just seems like the forgiving mechanics of it make it completely overpowered. 

The whole aspect of killing green dragons for money back in the 2000’s was that there was risk involved of getting pked, but if you didn’t get pked it was very good money. 

Now, you don’t have to risk anything and can sit afk with no gear and still get good gp/hour (I understand in the age of Vorkath, Raids, and Zulrah it’s not absurd money, but it still has almost no requirements).

You may say “oh but if you get pked when it’s in your inventory then you lose it!”, to which I will say the odds of that happening are nearly zero because you can just place it down if you are getting pked, or you will most likely protect the pieces. “But if you get pked you lose your cannonballs!” - theres really no reason to bring more than 100-200 cannonballs per trip because of how many wilderness teleports exist now come and the fact that you can leave your cannon on the ground permenantly with no risk involved.

Really, go to any world at any time at any green dragon spot and there will be a venezuelan with a cannon set up risking &gt;25k gp and making 700k+ per hour.

There’s a reason why cannons can’t be used in various dungeons and caves, and for the same reason cannons shouldn’t be used in the wild. If anything, you should risk at least some gp to use one in the wildy. 

What about if you died in wild with your cannon down, it is treated the same as untradeables in deep wilderness? Reclaimation fee + gp for pker.",15,1585372947,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqe1gm/why_are_cannons_allowed_in_the_wilderness/,2007scape,1

fqc8ec,xFallacyx69,The secret to LMS,"I just figured it out boys. I cry all the time about how LMS is RNG based because I make it to top 3 almost EVERY game but hardly ever win... BUT now I realize that I’m just pure trash!

Let me explain! I’m sitting here at the opening and I’m all potted up (I know, like a true Rookie). Anyways, the tribrid God who attacked me right away deserved to smack me like the trash I am. I see he’s bolting for his first attack, so naturally I pray range and try to catch a freeze, but this absolute unit is WAY too smart for me.  He opts to use absolutely no overhead and continue to bolt me the ENTIRE time. I’m thinking, thank you RNGesus that absolute God DC’d so it’s an easy kill.... Boy was I wrong. 

Using the most advanced tactics of all time he gets me to use half of my food before I catch a freeze while he continues to grab some food from the fridge while his character bolts me with no overheads. He’s got me right where he wants me. My trash brain tells me to go right for the quadruple spec as soon as I unleash my first bolt, and BOOM he’s low health. But this guy is just angered by my feeble attempts at greatness. He turns the tables and eats back to FULL HEALTH for the first time!

BUT little does he know I have 3 specs left in me. I sit back and wait for another big bolt hit and BOOM two more DDS specs send him back to 1/3 health... but remember boys this guy is a pro, so he eats to full health once again. I’m not out of it yet, though, so I catch one more freeze, switch to my trust tune cbow splash a couple 0’s on this unit then BOOM I hit a 13 and go in for my final DDS Spec... I think you know what happens next! That’s right, you’re truly gets the tribrid God back to about 15 hp! He eats to about half health because I assume he’s nearly out of sharks. But boys he’s got me right where he wants me...

I have a total of 1 shark left and he pulls a quick switcharoo on my garbage excuse for an tribrid and puts his protect from range on! Dammit! But I’m not completely useless, so I pot up again, then switch to my whip and give him a couple quick 0’s to the dome, followed by a 8... he’s struggling boys, but he’s almost done with his snacks and I’m a nuisance so he eats another shark, puts protect from melee on and forces me to bolt him again. Another couple hits in the teens and I’ve got him right where I want him. He prays range again but I won’t be tricked this time! I’ve got about 30 hp left, and right as I’m about to eat my shark, I hit that MASSIVE 3 that sent him back to the lobby! Thank you RNGesus! I pick up my loot, kill one more player, grab 2 loot boxes and finish 3rd!!!

And that’s how I almost lost to a guy who used nothing but bolts and had no overhead prayer for 90% of the fight. 3 pints boys, giving LMS lessons out here! Fight was at about 9:30 PM CST world 492.

fqacqe,darksoulsfinalboss,Been talking with Mod Ash about a new direction for end game PvM that doesn't involve adding more and more bosses to the game,"You have probably heard people say that there's too many bosses and items coming into the game and that they should slow it down. But at the same time, without fresh, new and challenging content, the games interest declines at the top end. In fact, large amounts of high level players no longer play their mains. Preferring to jump on their irons or another game entirely. For end game PvM, your options while sounding massive are fairly limited after a while between 4 general choices. Gold farming, collection log hunting, pet hunting or speedrunning. What if we could add another option o that list.

Introducing enrage mechanics. 

For PvM in an instance like activities such as raids, zulrah, gauntlet, vorkath, nightmare and additional bosses that are ever added to the game; enrage mechanics will add that extra challenge for osrs that fills a gap.

# What are enrage mechanics?

Enrage mechanics booked down to the nuts and bolts are a mechanic that make bosses harder the more you kill them. 

For example, say I've killed Zulrah in an encounter and teleported out of the boss lair. The next time I enter Zulrahs instance, the boss will have been scaled up by 20% and 40% in the next fight, then 60% and so on. These scaling mechanics change the bosses stats, creating new metas and bringing more challenge the higher you manage to increaae the enrage percentage that is uncapped. It's conceivable that Zulrah's enrage % could be so high that her ranged auto attacks could be hitting you for 80+ hp per strike. These will be toggle-able or forced on select future bosses, depending on Jmod decisions. 

The reward for bothering with this playstyle is the challenge itself, better chances at uniques and potentially increased rates at pets for players that don't sink 10 hours per day 7 days a week. However, there are some catches.

Gambling your loot for a pet roll, much like exchanging a fire cape for a roll at the jad pet, means your loot is always destroyed in the process of that gamble. In addition, climbing enrage requires sacrificing your loot as well. So you're exchanging your normal drops for either pet rolls or better chances at uniques. This would drastically reduce the amount of regular loot entering the game from bossing activities. In addition to punishing mechanics, osrs could add a twist to enrage mechanics that delete your enrage progress upon death. Meaning you have to climb the ladder all over again. This rewards perfecting content and will over time, push more players into the woox and xzact realm of skill by forcing players to think outside the box and deal with new problems at higher enrages.

At higher enrages for certain bosses, new phases could be added as well. Making the content even more difficult. Finally osrs will have that never ending difficulty setting that just keeps getting harder the more you push your limits.

Mod Ash himself said this would be fun. I think it would as well. How about you? Would you be interested to participate or watch your favourite streamers or YouTubers do this style of PvM? It Would be a nice change from endless ironman grinding or speedrunning.",20,1585358121,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fqacqe/been_talking_with_mod_ash_about_a_new_direction/,2007scape,1

Right now i dont really have to spend much time on either for diferent reasons, mostly 2019-nCov since i worked ""illegally"" (in my country this is very common since hiring a worker legally is quite expensive) which means that i must save as much as i can.  


Anyways, thats why i dont want to buy  a bond/month of membership if possible. On the other hand, i have at least 2+weeks free until quarantine ends here in my country and id like to be able to play.  


Ive been picking up red spider eggs, killing ogress shamans, telegrabing wine of zamorak, etc. All of those things are HEAVILY botted though, but i figured it was the only reasonable way to get up to a bond.  
I started with like 500k a week ago but im up to 3.1m now. My bank is worth like 10m+ but most of it is tied in membs runes/arrows/bolts/abby whip/etc.  


im looking for a way to convert that to cash to buy a bond but i dont want to break any game rule.

fq70g2,AboslutelyRidiculous,"500 Hours, Alot of money spent over the years, and we are all left feeding of Jagex's BS"," 

I, RQ170 on OSRS, am absolutely fed up with how Jagex handles their players inquires, reports, and means of managing their account.

I have been playing RS since 2004 and have made many accounts, spent many hours and have dedicated my own money to play their games. I've gone through the Funorb/Arcanist days, have suffered with the trade limits and PvP updates only to be resorting to an automated system regarding my accounts. There is no Customer support with this company, we have to rely on bitching through Social Media platforms at them and hoping someone is able to see the posts.

I just cannot stand it anymore, when I go to recover my ""locked"" account; Which I will clarify was locked due to a Player that I allowed them to utilize my MAXED DHER PKER, consistently logging in with incorrect passwords to intentionally lock the account to annoy me; Has now been asking me to reset my accounts status through an email I have not used in years.

To clarify what I am saying is, I have changed my accounts email access years ago to better consolidate my communications and not be stuck with multiple emails. Now Jagex clearly has done something in recent years to reset the login email for recovery back to the originating email. I was in the USAF during my time of creating this account and used an email that was created prior to me joining the service. Hence I was young and dumb and have not utilized the email as a main one, i've let it die so that I can ensure that I can maintain my 2 current ones; Business and Personal emails.

Now, I go to recover my account which has been updated with my current emails as of many years, am stuck having to try to figure out how to unlock my account when it is asking for the Originating email to make the account. I have tried numerous times to verify information when sorry to say, it's outdated and like many of you I do not document every pencil stroke I make.

Jagex has essentially allowed itself to become a hated company that loves to piss off it's players while giving them crumbs to keep addicted upon. I literally cannot understand this anymore and my thousands of hours upon numerous accounts and money spent mean nothing to them. They know they can keep people hooked by appealing to them with hearsay, rumors, and utter verbiage garbage that makes the players think they will see true improvements to the game.

fq6qbw,AboslutelyRidiculous,"Over 500 hours, numerous attempts to recover my locked account, Jagex still loves to bullshit it's players with automated systems.","I, RQ170 on OSRS, am absolutely fed up with how Jagex handles their players inquires, reports, and means of managing their account.

I have been playing RS since 2004 and have made many accounts, spent many hours and have dedicated my own money to play their games. I've gone through the Funorb/Arcanist days, have suffered with the trade limits and PvP updates only to be resorting to an automated system regarding my accounts. There is no Customer support with this company, we have to rely on bitching through Social Media platforms at them and hoping someone is able to see the posts.

I just cannot stand it anymore, My login email for my current main is: [Silicity@live.com](mailto:Silicity@live.com), yet when I go to recover my ""locked"" account; Which I will clarify was locked due to a Player that I allowed them to utilize my MAXED DHER PKER, consistently logging in with incorrect passwords to intentionally lock the account to annoy me; Has now been asking me to reset my accounts status through an email I have not used in years.

To clarify what I am saying is, I have changed my accounts email access years ago to better consolidate my communications and not be stuck with multiple emails. Now Jagex clearly has done something in recent years to reset the login email for recovery back to the originating email. I was in the USAF during my time of creating this account and used an email that was created prior to me joining the service. Hence I was young and dumb and have not utilized the email as a main one, i've let it die so that I can ensure that I can maintain my 2 current ones; Business and Personal emails. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I go to recover my account which has been updated with my current emails as of many years, am stuck having to try to figure out how to unlock my account when it is asking for the Originating email to make the account. I have tried numerous times to verify information when sorry to say, it's outdated and like many of you I do not document every pencil stroke I make. 

Jagex has essentially allowed itself to become a hated company that loves to piss off it's players while giving them crumbs to keep addicted upon. I literally cannot understand this anymore and my thousands of hours upon numerous accounts and money spent mean nothing to them. They know they can keep people hooked by appealing to them with hearsay, rumors, and utter verbiage garbage that makes the players think they will see true improvements to the game.

Where is the proper support? Change your outlook from seeing us as wallets you can pick out of and see us as the individuals that are more than willing to support the game without bullshit arbitrage against us.",2,1585346036,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fq6qbw/over_500_hours_numerous_attempts_to_recover_my/,2007scape,1

This is a repeat post in the hopes that someone will actually reply with some help as I am really desperate!

I have been trying to disable my Authenticator for the last week however the email will not come through. I have submitted a ticket but the answer and support given didn’t help. When I try to change email I am asked for the Authenticator code once entered my user name and password but the phone with the Authenticator is broken. Every bit of support given to me requires me to log in and then I need to give the code from the google authentication app which I don’t have. I have trawled through forums and threads from all websites to try and figure this out but I am just not finding a solution. This isn’t an attempt to hack an account as I have the username and password. I have received other email from jagex such as a reset password email so I know it’s not my email address that is wrong.

I have tried doing the appeal on the website but it seemed to be a very robotic response that claims my appeal has been reviewed, and I wont get another chance for an appeal. My account has been WRONGFULLY BANNED.

I have worked hundreds of hours on my account and I would never do anything to put my account at risk of being banned.  I'm seeking help in getting my account back or at least a proper response to why I was wrongfully banned with no chance at an appeal where I can provide counter evidence. I created a twitter and a reddit account and am going to great lengths to try to get my account back. Mod Ash was the only one to respond to me on Twitter and all he said was it's not his field and he cant help or encourage other mods to help me, so I am turning to Reddit.

fq516x,JoeT-OSRS,Fix Last Man Standing Jagex!!,"So I have been playing a lot of the Last Man Standing mini-game recently. One thing I have noticed which really bugs me is that you hardly get rewarded for kills and its all about what position you come.

The problem with this is that people just tank until there's 19 players left and then suicide to get 1 point and keep doing it over and over, also doing this gains you more points per hour than getting 3 kills which provides you with 1 extra bonus point lol. I really think getting kills should grant you with more points, I understand there are people who aren't very good at pking so I can understand the points given on place, but definitely more kill  should reward you more greatly

Also with the mechanics being this way it really ruins it because there are people who hide the entire game and when you kill the last 'real guy' some kid in the starter gear with no upgrades will come running in and just let you kill them and they take second place and are rewarded 4 points, while the other guy who you beat before probably worked his ass off and gets less points that someone who just hides the entire game it makes no sense?",3,1585341030,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fq516x/fix_last_man_standing_jagex/,2007scape,1

fq4sfi,JetPackGriffin,The Efficient Mage Training Arena,"After spending quite a bit of time at the Mage Training Arena, I found myself wanting more information about efficiency and runes needed. The hard part is that some of the numbers are dated or relative, and I found myself being just short or wayover on runes required for items. 

I wanted something a bit more exact. First, let me share that this post is inspired by u/Carnacra's post a few years ago. If you haven't seen it, it's a fantastic post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3d4paa/mage\_training\_arena\_log/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3d4paa/mage_training_arena_log/). There's also a great overall reference on the Wiki here: [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pizazz\_points](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Pizazz_points) .

The question is posed:

**So, how many runes do I need to get \_\_\_\_\_, and how much XP will I get?**

This question is relative to the points required for each item, and also dependent on what spells you'll be casting (or what Magic level you are). We're going to calculate the points earned on an average, and a maximum. Maximum is theoretical (really emphasizing theoretical here), and would literally be the absolute **worst** outcome, but allows you to plan for the lower bounds of RNG.

# Average Runes and Time Required For Each Item

These averages assume you have average luck, and are playing at peak efficiency. This means these figures are based off of a player following the strategies mentioned, and being near tick perfect. Most players will likely be around 60-75% efficiency in consideration of time averages.

|Item|Avg. Runes Used|Avg. Time at 100% Efficiency|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Infinity Gloves|307 Law, 876 Nature, 645 Cosmic (Lvl-1), 180 Cosmic (Lvl-6)|2.84 Hours (Lvl-1 Enchant), 2.45 Hours (Lvl-1 Enchant)|
|Infinity Hat|613 Law, 1593 Nature, 1290 Cosmic (Lvl-1), 360 Cosmic (Lvl-6)|5.49 Hours (Lvl-1 Enchant), 4.71 Hours (Lvl-6 Enchant)|

\*\*Will likely require less Nature Runes (since you'll be healing with other food), and time will be a bit longer

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's get into it.

**I'm assuming the following:**

* You're somewhat familiar with the mechanics of the Mage Training Arena.
* Your goal is to get your item(s) as quick as possible.
* You're being efficient in the Graveyard room.
* You have Bones to Peaches.
* You're casting High Alchemy.
* You have Stamina potions.
* You are using staves that provide free elemental runes.
* You aren't collecting Dragonstones.

# The Alchemy Room

Our goal in the alchemy room is to alchemize the items that have the most value, purely for efficiency. It's a good strategy to carry 2 of each item in your inventory for when the items rotate stations. This allows you to alch while moving between deposit boxes.

The Alchemy room has 5 items that rotate every 42.2 seconds. In a sample of 212, 42.2-second rotations, 72 of them had free items. We can assume that a free item will occur 1 out of 3 rotations. Considering that items can never be the same consecutive value, this means we can assume there is a chance of consuming no nature runes.

Things to note:

* Our goal is to alchemize the items that are 30 coins each
* Items rotate every 42.2 seconds
* Free items can appear in consecutive rotations
* An item will never be the same value after a rotation
* Alchemy takes 5 ticks, or 3 seconds to cast
* We're going to assume at peak efficiency, you'll get 10 alchs in per rotation, or 15 alchs per minute
* 100 coins are equal to 1 point

&amp;#x200B;

**Alchemy Room Calculations**

*Average Nature Runes Saved from Free Items*

= (Chance of free item) \* (Chance of 30 coins item, non-repeating)

=(1/3) \* (1 - \~.8438)

= (1/3) \* (\~.1562) 

= **5.21% Natures Runes Saved per Alch**

*Alchemy Room - Points Per Hour*

 = ((Alchs Per Minute) \* (60 minutes) \*  (30 coins)) / (100 coins per point)

= (900 Alchs per Hour) \* (30 coins) / (100 coins per point)

= (27000 coins) /100

= **270 Alchemy Room Points Per Hour**

*Alchemy Room* \- *Average Nature Runes Consumed per Point*

=  (Nature Rune Consumption Chance) \* (100 coins per point) / (Coins Per Alch)

= (1.00 - .0521) \* 100 / (30)

= **3.16 Nature Runes per Point (Average)**

*Alchemy Room - Max Nature Runes Consumed Per Point*

= (100 coins per point) / (30 Coins Per Alch)

= **3.33 Nature Runes per Point (Max)**

*Alchemy Room - XP Per Point*

= (Bonus XP per Coin) \*(100 coins per point) +(100 coins per point) / (30 coins per Alch) \* (High Alch XP)

= 2\*100+ 3.33 \* 65

= **416.67 XP per Alchemy Point**

&amp;#x200B;

# The Telekinetic Room

The telekinetic room has great documentation already. I'll be citing a few references from the Wiki:  [https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mage\_Training\_Arena/Telekinetic\_Theatre](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mage_Training_Arena/Telekinetic_Theatre).

Things to note:

* There are 10 mazes in total.
* The average number of casts of telekinetic grab for all mazes is 8.3.
* You gain 10 law runes after completing 5 mazes.
* The average time to complete each maze is 59.4 seconds.
   * We can assume maximum efficiency adds an additional 10 seconds for loading.
* Time calculations factor in not needing run energy, assuming the use of stamina potions.
* The longest maze is 76 seconds.
* The largest number of telegrabs needed is 10 per maze.
* You gain 2 points per maze, and 8 points upon completion of 5.
   * This makes the average points per maze 3.6.

**Telekinetic Room Calculations**

*Telekinetic Room - Average Law Runes Saved*

= 10 / (Average Law Runes Consumed) \*5

= 10 / (8.3\*5)

= **24.10% Law Runes Saved (Average)**

*Telekinetic Room - Lowest Law Runes Saved*

= 10 / (Average Law Runes Consumed) \*5

= 10 / (10\*5)

= **20.00% Law Runes Saved (Lowest)**

*Telekinetic Room - Average Points Per Hour*

= (Mazes Completed Per Hour)\* (Points Per Maze)

= (60\*(60/69.4)) \* 3.6

= **186.74 Telekinetic Room Points Per Hour (Average)**

*Telekinetic Room - Lowest Points Per Hour*

= (Mazes Completed Per Hour)\* (Points Per Maze)

= (60\*(60/86)) \* 3.6

= **150.70 Telekinetic Room Points Per Hour (Lowest)**

*Telekinetic Room* \- *Average Law Runes Consumed per Point*

*=* ((Average Law Runes Per Maze) \* (Average Law Runes Used)) / (Points Per Maze)

= (8.3 \* (1 - .241) / 3.6

= **1.75 Law Runes Per Point (Average)**

*Telekinetic Room* \- *Max Law Runes Consumed per Point*

*=* ((Max Law Runes Per Maze) \* (Max Law Runes Used)) / (Points Per Maze) 

= (10 \* (1 - .20)) / 3.6

= **2.22 Law Runes Per Point (Max)**

*Alchemy Room - XP Per Point (Average)*

= (Average Law Runes Per Point)\*(Telekinetic Grab XP) + (Bonus XP for maze completions)/(5 Maze Completions \* Average Casts Per Maze)

= (1.75 \* 43) + (1000)/(5 \* 8.3)

= **99.35 XP Per Telekinetic Point (Average)**

*Alchemy Room - XP Per Point (Lowest)*

= (Max Law Runes Per Point)\*(Telekinetic Grab XP) + (Bonus XP for maze completions)/(5 Maze Completions \* Max Casts Per Maze)

= (2.22\* 43) + (1000)/(5 \* 10)

= **115.46 XP Per Telekinetic Point (Max)**

# The Graveyard Room

The Graveyard Room is a very straightforward room. You collect bones, fill your inventory 20 spaces, and cast bones to bananas. If you're low on health, you cast bones to peaches. If you're interested in more around the strategy, see u/Carnacra's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/3d4paa/mage_training_arena_log/). 

Things to note:

* You get 1 point per 16 fruits deposited.
* We'll assume that it takes 20 ticks (12 seconds) to both collect and deposit fruits.
* Bananas or peaches both count as 1 fruit, therefore it's better to deposit more bananas.
* Peaches help heal you when low on health, but the spell should be used sparingly.
* You can cast on more fruits than the meta of 20, but we'll be calculating off of 20 slots.
* You take 2 damage every 10 ticks, or 6 seconds.
* We'll make an assumption that a player has 60 health.
   * This player will ideally heal once they've hit 20 health.
   * We'll estimate it takes 20 ticks (12 seconds) to heal up, which is the equivalence of 48 health.
   * The player will be taking damage while eating, equal to 4 health.
* You will receive 1 Water, Earth, Nature, Death or Blood rune per 16 points.

**Graveyard Room Calculations**

*Graveyard Room - Peaches Consumed Per Hour*

= ((Seconds/Hour) / (Time to 40 Health in Seconds + Time to Eat in Seconds)) \* (Peaches Eaten per cast)

= (Number of Peach Casts per Hour) \* (Peaches Eaten Per Cast)

= (3600 / (120 + 12)) \* 6

= 27.2727 \* 6

= **164 Peaches Consumed Per Hour**

*Graveyard Room - Casts per Hour*

=((Seconds/Hour) /(Time to Deposit)) - (Peach Casts)) 

= (3600/12 - 27.2727)

= **272.73 Bone Casts Per Hour (27.27 Peach Casts, 245.56 Banana Casts)**

*Graveyard Room - Fruit Deposited Per Hour*

= (Bone Casts Per Hour) \* 20 - (Peaches Consumed)

= (Fruit Created) - (Peaches Consumed)

= (3600/12 - 27.2727) \* 20 - 164

= (300 - 27.2727) \* 20 - 164

= **5,291 Fruits Deposited Per Hour**

*Graveyard Room - Points Per Hour*

= (Fruits Deposited Per Hour) / 60

= **330.69 Graveyard Points Per Hour**

*Graveyard Room - Points Per Cast*

*= (1/16) \* (Fruits Deposited Per Hour) / (Bone Casts Per Hour)*

= (1/16) \* (5291/272.73 + 27.27)

= **1.21 Points Per Cast**

*Graveyard Room - Nature Runes Saved Per Cast*

= (Chance of Nature Rune Reward) \* (Total Casts/ (All Casts Per Hour+Peach Casts) \* Points Per Cast

= .20 \* (272.73/300) \* 1.21

**= 22.00% Nature Runes Saved**

*Graveyard Room - Nature Runes Per Point*

*=* (1 - Nature Runes Saved) \* (Points Per Cast)

= .78 \* 1.21

= **.94 Average Nature Runes Per Graveyard Point**

*Graveyard Room - XP Per Graveyard Point*

= ((Peach Casts \* (Peach XP)+ Banana Casts \* (Banana XP))/(Total Casts))/(Points Per Cast)

= ((27.27\* 35.5) + (25 \* 272.73))/300)/(1.21)

= **21.45 XP Per Graveyard Point**

# The Enchanter's Room

The Enchanter's Room is arguably the easiest. The meta here has changed. While dragonstones do provide more points per enchant, they actually damage how efficiently you get points. The best method is to go to a corner with 2 shapes, and split your inventory in half. For the calculations below, we're going to use Lvl-1 Enchant (that way multipliers can be applied for magic level).

Things to Note:

* You gain 1 point per level of enchantment cast.
   * This means casting Lvl-4 Enchant is 4 points, wheras Lvl-6 Enchant is 6 points.
   * We'll assume you won't ever cast a Lvl-7 Enchant, as they're incredibly expensive.
* There are 4 shapes, excluding Dragonstones.
* Picking up Dragonstones can net 14 points per enchant, but they take a long time to spawn.
* You will ideally have 25 inventory spaces free per inventory.
   * You'll have 12 of 1 shape, and 13 of another.
   * This realistically makes your chance of enchanting the bonus shape 50%.
   * If you enchant the bonus shape, you gain an additional 2 points per enchantment.
* It takes 1 tick (.6 seconds) to pick up a shape, or 15 seconds for a full inventory.
* If not auto-casting, you will enchant one shape every 3 ticks (1.8 seconds).
   * If auto-casting, you'll enchant one shape every 7 ticks (4.2 seconds).
* We'll assume you'll add 8 seconds per inventory from moving between deposits and piles.
* Every tenth shape is worth double points.
   * This effectively makes a point multiplier of 1.1
* For every 20 shapes deposited, you'll gain 3 cosmic, death, or blood runes.

**Enchanter Room Calculations**

*Enchanter Room - Cosmic Runes Saved Per Cast*

= 3 \* (Chance of Cosmic Runes) / (Shapes Required for Reward)

= 3 \* (1/3) / 20

**= 5.00% of Cosmic Runes Saved**

*Enchanter Room - Casts per Hour (No Auto-Cast)*

= (Seconds/Hour) / (Time to Collect Shapes + Time to Cast + Movement Time)

= 3600 / (.6 + 1.8 + (8/25)) 

= 3600 / 2.72

= **1323.53 Casts Per Hour (No Auto-Cast), 703.13 Casts Per Hour (Auto-Cast)**

*Enchanter Room - Points per Cast at Lvl-1 Enchant*

= (Tenth Shape Bonus Multiplier)\*((Enchant Level) + (Chance of Bonus Shape \* 2))

= 1.1 \* (1+1)

**= 2.2 Points Per Cast (Lvl-1 Enchant) \[or Enchant Level \* 1.1 + 1.1 Per Cast\]**

*Enchanter Room - Points per Hour (No Auto-Cast)*

= (Casts Per Hour) \* (Points per Cast)

= 1323.53 \* (1.1\*1 + (1/2) \* 2)

**= 2,779.41 Enchant Points Per Hour At Lvl-1 Enchant (No Auto-Cast), 1476.57  (Auto-Cast)**

**= 10,191.18 Enchant Points Per Hour at Lvl-6 Enchant (No Auto-Cast), 5,414.10 (Auto-Cast)**

*Enchanter Room - Cosmic Runes Per Point*

= (Chance of Cosmic Rune Consumed) / (Points Per Cast Formula)

= (1 - .05) / (1.1 + 1.1)

= **.43 Cosmic Runes Per Point At Lvl-1 Enchant**

= **.12 Cosmic Runes Per Point at Lvl-6 Enchant**

*Enchanter Room - XP Per Enchantment Point*

= (Enchant XP) / (Points Per Cast)

= 17.5 / 2.2

= **7.95 XP Per Enchantment Point At Lvl-1 Enchant, 12.60 XP Per Enchant Point at Lvl-6 Enchant**

fq4pno,SpiderGooseLoL,Account locked means what?,"A couple days ago, I had to turn off my authenticator because I had reset my phone, and I didn't turn it back on. Of course not long after doing this, my account gets hacked, and they took all of the gear I was wearing (\~5m), but couldn't get into my bank yet because of the pin. So I changed my password, and turned back on the authenticator, but when I woke up this morning, the login page says that my account has been locked because it is suspected of being stolen. Does this mean that the hacker got my password again, after I changed it? (Some sort of keylogger?).

# Requirements

* 95 Slayer.
* 1,000 slayer points to access their services.

# Tasks

* Assigns only slayer-specific boss tasks. 
* Skipping more than 2 tasks in a row will cause the master to be angry with you and they won't assign you another task for 24 hours.

# Rewards (optional)

* Unlock that can increase or decrease the task number assigned while using this specific slayer master.
* Unlock that can increase the slayer experience received per boss kill.
* Access to a new drop table that includes the superiors uniques (i.e. imbued heart, eternal gem, dust and mist staves).

# Location of NPC

I thought about the Myth's guild. Could be placed just outside the Myth's guild so pures can access their services.

While I understand that some people aren't bothered by it or don't even notice it, some people do find the effect to be genuinely obnoxious. Personally I can't stand it because the effect doesn't even loop properly, it just sort of shittily jumps around. 

I wouldn't mind if this dungeon's only purpose was a short segment during the desert treasure quest, but for a dungeon you could potentially spend hours in I think this effect deserves a tune up.

# ELITE VOID RE-COLOR OPTION SUGGESTION

An option to be able to recolor elite void to the portal colors(Red,Blue,Yellow,Purple)  AND the option to be able to switch between Guardian or Executioner void like in Pre-EOC.

*Processing img g6fxpnjdq5p41...*

# Guardian(White):

* Blue
* Yellow
* Red

* Original
* Trim

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of each game, you will have a 1/2000 of receiving a Pest soul from Pest control.  1/1000 in the intermediate boat.  1/500 in the veteran boat.  (Tried to even it out because of how overcrowded the beginning boat can be with bots)

# What is a Pest soul?

A Pest soul is a livid parasite soul that rarely come in contact with the human world. It has been told from the void knights that seeing one of these souls usually come every 50 years. Pest souls can modify your elite version of void equipment to a different color scheme. There are 4 souls to be collected.

* Blue parasite soul
* Purple parasite soul
* Red parasite soul
* Yellow parasite soul

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on which portal you damage most, higher chance of you receiving that specific color soul. For example, doing more damage on the blue portal will give you a higher chance of receiving the blue color soul.

&amp;#x200B;

So chance of receiving color roll:

Beginner: 1/2,000

Intermediate: 1/1,000

Veteran: 1/500

&amp;#x200B;

Chance of receiving specific color roll:

Least damage:

* Blue: 1/4
* Red: 1/4
* Yellow: 1/4
* Purple: 1/4

Semi damage:

* Blue: 1/3
* Red: 1/3
* Yellow: 1/3
* Purple: 1/3

Good damage:

* Blue: 1/2
* Red: 1/2
* Yellow: 1/2
* Purple: 1/2

Most damaged:

* Blue: 1/1
* Red: 1/1
* Yellow: 1/1
* Purple: 1/1

So a good example of how the damage system works:

* Blue: 1/1
* Red: 1/4
* Yellow: 1/3
* Purple: 1/2

Blue having the most damage while red has the least damage. Because of that, Blue has a higher chance of being received.

# Shop

* 1,000 pest control points in the pest control shop to unlock the color schemes.(4,000 in total to buy all)

&amp;#x200B;

# How to change color schemes

Once it has been unlocked, you shall be able to speak with an NPC within the Void Knights HQ to be able to change the color of your void to the one you have unlocked.  You can be able to change the color of the void at any time(Excluding the Guardian and Executioners recolor).  You can only have one color set on the elite void at a time, you cannot have more than one colored set within your inventory or bank. (Red circles)

Toggle to switch the color of the turquoise/black part(For the Executioner and Guardian Elite void) or maybe 25 points to switch in-between(50 total to switch between Executioner and Guardian and Turquoise and Black).  I know the majority of players prefer what we have now, which is the re-colored black part of Elite void. But just to make the old and new players happy, why not implement both versions?  If this were to be implemented, players will still have the black-colored guardian themed void (Green circle) upon login, but when getting elite void for the 1st time, you will have the option to choose Black/Turquoise Guardian/Executioner void but in order to switch between either turquoise or black, you'd have to change it up with one of the high ranks at Void Knight HQ. Same goes with the Executioner and Guardian colored void. (Blue Circles)

# Trimmed Elite Void

Now in order to receive Trim Guardian or Executioner void, think of it just like White Graceful where you'd have to get all cities favour to 100%

&amp;#x200B;

* You need to complete at least a total of 1,000 successful Pest control games in order to unlock trimmed guardian or executioner void.

OR

* Unlock all colored scheme voids to unlock trim. (White circles)

&amp;#x200B;

THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO GET THEM! I would like to hear everyone suggestion on how to achieve them as well!

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried my very best with the color palette to make it give off that old school feel.

fpmxde,Zathplanet,Perm mutes non appealable?,"After trying to get a partner for shield of arrav on my ironman for about an hour and a half I  logged onto my main account and found out that I could not see the text messages that I wrote on my ironman, afterwards I checked the account status of the account to check if it was actually muted which it was: https://imgur.com/a/GoONzDW

The email the account is linked to is normally only used to use as an adress that can be used when a site I go to requires an email adress to sign up or view the content, essentially an email adress that is designed to catch spam emails. One of the passwords linked to a website it has been used on must have been the same as the one on the runescape account and compromised the account in 2013.

The rs account was created with the purpose of being a OSRS ironman, and the mute was applied on rs3 for being an advertising spambot it seems, although the evidence of only one of the three mutes is visible. The hijacker did use it as a spambot so in that context the mute was correctly applied, however I recovered the account and would like for it to be unmuted. The problem is that there is no option anywhere that I could find to appeal the mute, perhaps because the account was hit with 3 mutes that it makes it unappealable. I went through the official support page but when you select mute it just redirects to the account status page which does not seem to have any option for me to select to appeal the mute.

Due to the progress I have made in the past days i'd like to be able to talk with other players again rather than make a new account and have to restart.  

The email adress has a new password and so does the rs account, and an authenticator has been applied.

fpmvtw,pidgns,New(ish) Player. Looking for Low Level (25-75) Slayer Grind Advice. :),"Heya! 👋 

I’m just getting back into the whole OSRS thing from about 15 years of not playing. I’ve been playing about 2 months now and am loving it! I’m about to finish up the Barrows Glove quest grind (sitting at 165 QPs at the moment) and am looking towards future plans. 

I’m a little tired of questing and wanted to start training combat (haven’t trained any combat outside of questing) through slayer but am curious as to what method to approach it with. I have a few ideas in mind: 

   Idea 1: Krystillia from 25-75 Slayer. This will teach me how to tank pkers, get some money from emblems, and stack points to unlock rewards/blocks.

   Idea 2: Konar  from 25-75 Slayer to stack eventual Arclight charges, totem pieces, and brimstone keys. 

   Idea 3: Going with Nieve, and at milestones Konar split once I get combat level reqs for Nieve.

Are the points from nothing but Wildy slayer overkill if I were to just camp Wildy tasks all the way to 75. Or is it better to do combo of Konar/Wildy until you unlock nieve, then move to Konar/Nieve combo?

Thanks in advanced for all the help!

Happy Scaping,

fpl3zt,OneTrickPoro,PvP update suggestion.,"When pvp was removed in the rwt update, revs were added to make the wild dangerous. I want to expand on that idea.

What if we have npcs roaming the wild in large groups. They wear salad robes and flame you as the 10 npcs tb and mage you. You can either war with them or wait until the npc with black d hide runs by and distracts them (that npc drops a spade) or if another player with a clue scroll in their inventory runs by.

The mechanics of these npcs are that they change prayers and switches perfectly just like the average pker. They bolt you, tb, and barrage. 


Since we don't want to devalue snakeskin, rune cbows, strength ammies, salad robes, etc, I propose that they have supply drops.

They drop unnoted lobsters, water staff, 5-10 diamond or dragonstone bolts, 10-20 casts of ice barrage with no water runes, 3 laws, 1 house or cammy tab, and 2 dose prayer potions as common drops. 

1 dose super combat as an uncommon or rare drop. 

For super rare drops they can drop a dds, d dscim, or an ancient staff!

Now I know what you're thinking, this seems stupid because they don't drop anything useful. Well, since we know this isn't true when you kill a real pker, I propose that we add a random 1-5m cash stack drop to simulate the pking experience.

On rarer occasions, these npcs show up in mystic. Sometimes they show up solo. If you kill a mystic npc solo there is a chance for an immediate spawn of the superior pker npc team. This team spawns with full ancestral arma and elys. These spawns will be extremely hard to kill because the npcs will tag you. They are also extremely good at prayer switches and you will always hit on their protection prayer. If they lose any hp, they brew up to 120.

If you manage to kill any of these elite spawns, you will get all of their gear, but the catch is you are perma tbed until you run down to the border. 

My proposed idea will help to rejuvinate the wild by adding more content and a level of difficulty no one has ever experienced before.",0,1585261578,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fpl3zt/pvp_update_suggestion/,2007scape,1

fpj0m6,Billy-Ken,Loot from 16 Galvek attempts,"My first post just to say I finished DS2! I'm not very good hence the 16 attempts but tried it at about 80/80/75 with 80 range, 73 prayer. I used Verac's helm, Kairl's Leathertop, Verac's plateskirt, Archer's ring, amulet of fury, DCB, DFS, ruby dragon bolts e (first 3 phases), diamond dragon bolts e (last phase), barrows gloves, blessed d'hide boots with BGS spec x2.

First attempt I forgot to drink antifire..dead on arrival. Next 4 or so I had no idea what I was doing and was just getting blasted during the first phase. Then, I starting learning the movements and would make it to the water phase. Had two straight attempts where my auto-retaliate brought me back into Galvek's wave from the safe spot...turned that off. I made it to the final round when I started to do the following: pre-medicate with saradomin brew, super restore, super combat, range, extended anti-fire, and Xanax (in that order) in lunar isle bank then head over to Torfinn.

A few things I felt helped me that I learned during the attempts:

1. BGS spec x2 (couldn't afford dwh) with piety, in the beginning, helped so much when I added the super combat. First phase would go by a lot quicker if I hit both specs.
2. During the fire phase, I would run horizontally if facing Galvek and got slapped by his melee. Quickly found out that he could not melee you if you were on the last tile on each side so I would just run from the end of one side to the end of the other when needed. He would still occasionally melee during the run.
3. Turn of auto-retaliate lol
4. I don't know if this was just luck, but the attempt where I decided to use protect from missiles after the fire stage I defeated him with 4 food, 3 saradomin brews, and a restore left. I thought it made a massive difference. I felt like the magic damage was the same but the range damage was drastically improved.

Inventory would be 7 Saradomin Brews, 3 super restores, 1 range potion, bolt switch, BGS/dcb +dfs switch, 7 dark crabs and 7 karambwan.

Total approx cost of supplies from attempts- 3.3 mil.

16 item retrievals, 24 super restores, 60 Saradomin brews, 5 extended anti-fires,124 dark crabs, 120 karambwan, Range potions, 2 Super combat, 222 ruby dragon bolts e, 40 Diamond dragon bolts, 32 Lunar Isle Teleports

Tl;dr I am not good at this game and spent 3.3 mil on galvek supplies, but I did it! Happy scaping and be safe out there!

Anyway since I’m quarantined now I was planning on getting back into OSRS after about a 4 month break. My phone broke a couple months ago, but was able to get a backup from iCloud onto my new phone. However, my authenticator app doesn’t display the “code” to get into my osrs account. I’m sure I didn’t use an email or anything with the authenticator, just downloaded the app, scanned the code on osrs website and was using that to log in. I know you can disable the authenticator but my registered email is inaccessible since I lost the password and have no way to recover it. 

So is there any way I can somehow get the authenticator to display the code for my OSRS account? I figured it would have transferred over with my phone backup

is recovering the account my only option?

fpf4pf,Dudlebop24,OSRS Mobile: Auto toggle off single tap,"OSRS mobile is pretty great, but there are 2 main issues in my opinion that prevent it from being as useable as the desktop version. The biggest problem is the ability to right click. Press and hold is super annoying to use 1) if your target is moving its hard to click accurately, 2) if you're doing something that requires right clicking over and over, the slight delay from pressing and holding feels like and eternity, 3) if you're doing something dangerous, issues from 1 and 2 could be catastrophic.

The single tap option that makes every tap a right click is on the right track. I think it would be greatly improved if there was an option that allowed it to auto toggle off after a single use. This effectively turns ""tap + hold"" to ""tap function button + tap"". Currently the single tap mode stays on until you tap it again (which acts as a right click) and tap to turn it off, which is 2 additional taps on top of the 2 you needed to right click in the first place.",2,1585242114,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fpf4pf/osrs_mobile_auto_toggle_off_single_tap/,2007scape,2

fpeujb,HornsAce91,Quest Idea: Revival of the Forgotten,"Foreword: This idea was just thought about over a couple times of playing. It's not the best formed idea but I figured I'd throw it out there to see what y'all thought!

Revival of the Forgotten Quest

The Revival of the Forgotten quest is to open up various weekly rewards, team bossing, expansion on the lore within OSRS regarding the Ancient/Zaros empire in its current state, and to finally expand peoples risk within the wilderness.  This quest would come tiered and completion of each tier adds better rewards, less risk, and convenience of access. It also opens up skilling within the wilderness to allow for more profitability to actually come from skilling while pairing its risk. 

Summary: A disturbance has occurred at multiple points within the most remote locations of Gielinor.  These disturbances can are being investigated by the Runecrafting experts in the world. Zarosian acolytes are attempting to bring back Zaros through rituals hidden by their locations within the wilderness and their unquestioned existence within the Kharidian Desert. These rituals have inflicted various points within the wilderness with an unseen magicks.  You must go to Aubrey to discuss his findings. Aubrey will have you go investigate the sites within the wilderness to take samples before he realizes that this magic is very similar to that of Ancient Magicks and advises you go speak to Azzandra.  Azzandra will elaborate on rumors that have been floating throughout the desert that acolytes have hidden themselves within the wilderness in a cave to hide their rituals. When you investigate the cave, you learn of the various benefits the inflicted items like additional resources from skilling but also that a set of caves has developed from instability of the magick within a set of ruins in the wilderness.  The acolytes have taken the inflicted living creatures to this cave and intend to perform their final spell there due to the concentration of magick amplifying their abilities.  As you leave to report back to Aubrey, you’re caught and almost killed from a hard hitting Ice Barrage, and they teleport out. You investigate the cave and find an amulet and return it to Aubrey who looks into it but cannot understand what it’s used for and again advises you to consult with Azzandra.  Azzandra explains that these were used in the old days to gain access to the Zarosian Empire and required adventurers to prove themselves through various tasks. This amulet requires charging which takes you across Gielinor. This aspect of the quest can be done in a tiered format which requires varying level of skills, quests, boss kils, etc. Azzandra advises what needs to be done for the basic tier and that these acolytes need to be stopped at once to prevent disastrous effects. Aubrey advises that you satisfy the requirements for the amulet and go stop them. Once it has been done, the quest will allow the amulet to locate the caves which is several levels with shortcuts for agility. At the bottom of the caves, you find the Zarosian Acolytes walking into a portal. The last acolyte Ice barrages you and explains that various extremely difficult monsters are between the entrance of the caves and where they perform their ritual, that no one can get through it and stop them now. As you enter the instanced portal, you will find yourself battling various bosses that while difficult, are significantly easier than what it’d take during the actual raid/dungeon which should require a small team. These monsters are a Chaos Dwarf, Ent, Lava Dragon, Ice Troll, and the final boss, the Zarosian Acolyte with good drops. Azzandra will appear in a less ghostly form and help you with each boss as you start to fail. He will freeze the boss at the start and tell you what their abilities might be. Whether ice barraging the boss to allow you a moment to reposition, healing you and slightly damaging the boss with a blood barrage, refilling your potions, or conjuring some food; he assists the learning process for these boss mechanics for the quests. Before you go into the Zarosian Acolyte fight, he ensures you’re adequately prepared in supplies. He explains that he will not assist again and the only reason he is now is because they’re not trying to bring back Zaros but turn one of the acolytes into an overpowered and crazed acolyte. They will need to be stopped again but once they realize he’s there, they will change their ways in the future so he can’t join you and you will need a team to fend them off in the future. You continue into the chambers. Upon killing the Crazed Zarosian Acolyte, Azzandra dissipates back to the Desert and any remaining acolytes teleport out. You collect any available loot and return to Aubrey who advises that he would like to purchase these amulets if you can create them. He will purchase one per week so he can research it and find out how to better utilize this magic in the future.  
This quest will then open the door for a weekly tasks similar to Tears of Guthix but you will be rewarded with a drop table with an additional roll per the tier level of the amulet. You can only possess one amulet at a time until you reach the highest tier which requires you to turn in 5 max tier amulets. After which, Aubrey says the next one you bring, he (or the warding master should that exist) will imbue it to allow it to be permanently attached to you as an untradable and allow you to continue farming amulets to turn in without sacrificing your own. 

While this potential miniquest will bring more money and supplies into the game, since the dungeon would be in the wilderness, your gear should drop and be required to be purchased back based on the GE value of the gear with each tier of amulet granting you a lower price for the buy back. The amulet should increase the value of gathering skills within the wilderness. Potentially have a Wilderness Server where there is an announcement where the inflicted resource is so people can race to gather the item, maybe it’s an Ent who will drop a significant amount of noted, high-valued logs or a Golem who will do the same for ore.  That way this ludicrous gathering format comes with risk but also returns money/value to gathering skills.

Use the amulet on traditional RC altars
Use on Rune Ore, Magic Tree, Shark Fishing Bubbles

(Ent Drop) Wonderleaf: Grows a crop in 1/100th the time. Herb Patch would grow in 48 seconds rather than 80 minutes.

Long story short, my account was hacked and I recovered it a couple of months later once I found out. During that time, my account was turned into a Zulrah bot, and I have 3,300 Zulrah kills tied to my account that are not mine.

I tried to reach out to Jagex through the only means I could find on the support section of their website, which was through the 'account hijacked' appeal form. I tried to explain, but all they did was lock my account and had me recover it again. I never received any message from them or anything.

Does anyone know if Jagex would even remove the kills for me? It feels really lame to have so many Zulrah kills on my account that are illegitimate.

fpcm69,siyq,Proposed Changes for Grotesque Guardians," know this has been brought up a few times before, but I feel like it needs to be a priority. This is a med level boss, which takes anywhere from 1:30-3:00 to kill. It involves heavy concentration, and prayer flicking with a range/melee switch. The drop table is terrible. With a 4 kill trip, I'm averaging 120-180k each trip.

&amp;#x200B;

First, the drop table desperately needs a buff. When you can farm regular gargoyles for 4x the profit as their boss alternative, something needs to be done.

Second, The last melee phase is so scuffed. The random attacks that are dealt should be avoidable in some way (whether he does a certain motion before melee/range, or even a Jad phase). The ability to mitigate his attacks should be available. It's demotivating when you're praying range 4 hits in a row as he hits non stop 20's with melee, and then when you switch to melee prayer, he hits a 15-15 range hit.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say that I REALLY want to like this boss. It is not AFKable, it takes concentration, and a little skill, but there needs to be some changes to it. This is not a post to complain, I just want to voice  an opinion.",21,1585233651,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fpcm69/proposed_changes_for_grotesque_guardians/,2007scape,1

fpc2kz,The-FarmAssist,Thank you guys for reminding me what a toxic community and subreddit this is.,"It's kind of funny, but sad at the same time. The majority of us started playing this game as children. Who knew that those same children who grew up and became adults would still act like children? You'd think that as people grew older they would mature, but sadly that isn't the case. Instead we have grown fucking adults acting like they're 12 years spewing their toxic bullshit to whomever comes their way. The amount of negativity and toxicity in this subreddit and the OSRS community greatly outweighs any good that comes from the game and this subreddit. 

If you feel offended by this post, then you're probably one of the many toxic players that I'm talking about. 

Thank you to the people who actually spread positivity, and try to help others. I appreciate you.

I don't think I'll ever use this subreddit again, and I'm seriously considering quitting OSRS. (Not that anyone cares, other than maybe my friends and cc)

fpb9we,cremation44,Is Castle Wars still a thing? Is OSRS an alive community?,"Hey everyone!!! RS gave me some of my fondest memories, I played fanatically from 2004-2007 and I remember so much about the game even though it’s been more than a decade since I stopped. 

I started a new account today on OSRS and the nostalgia is real - walking around Lumbridge, killing cows it’s great.

Is castle wars still a thing? I used to be obsessed with that game and I remember it used to absolutely pack up back in my day with tonnes of people.

I feel like this is a big question for me because one thing I noticed today was that the world didn’t feel as alive as it used to. If everyone is just maxing stats and stuff maybe the fun out of simple pleasures like castle wars or similar things is gone.

fpb2cn,FuhhCough,Just some thoughts on the recent downtime.,"1. The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.

3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.

4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.",15,1585227526,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fpb2cn/just_some_thoughts_on_the_recent_downtime/,2007scape,1

fpb1kd,szimo,Error_game_js5connect - Unable to connect to update server.,"RuneScape was unable to connect to the update server. This is most likely caused by a firewall blocking the connection.

To resolve this:

If you have firewall or security software installed, they can often block RuneScape from accessing its servers. Please ensure that RuneScape/Java can connect to its servers on port 43594.
Note: Windows XP Service Pack 2 has built in firewall software. If, when loading RuneScape, this asks if you want to allow the connection, you need to say 'yes'.
If that doesn't help, then an external firewall may be causing the problem. Please ask your network adminstrator/ISP to open port 43594 for TCP traffic so that RuneScape and Java can run correctly.
If problems persist, please refer to the Technical FAQs, which can be found in the Customer Support section of our website.

fpb1ff,darksoulsfinalboss,PvM is too easy. Please add an enrage mechanic,"For players not interested in challenges or pushing their boundaries, a toggle to prevent enrage increasing past base difficulty should be added. I.e. like playing a game on easy, medium, hard, survival difficulty as an example on that.

Look guys, this is just how it is for me and many other high level players. The game isn't difficult, there's no new challenges short of doing it all over again as an iron or on a restricted build or the endless speedrunning that's frankly fairly tedious when it gets to the point that you reset a CM if any of the RNG is bad for tek, crabs, scavs.

Uncapped enrage would allow players like me to push ourselves another way and invent new metas to deal with impossible situations. In short, it'd bring back some mystery and challenge to the game.",10,1585227411,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fpb1ff/pvm_is_too_easy_please_add_an_enrage_mechanic/,2007scape,1

Let's introduce slayer boss overhauls to make some of them more difficult. Even the Hydra could use some variation to his repertoire of merely counting 3 attacks over and over, perhaps each phase Hydra can change how it fights you and adds a ""jad"" style of fighting where you're meant to respond to an attack rather than anticipate based on the sequence before it.

Furthermore, adding a enrage mechanic to the game could be pretty sick. Make bosses harder each time you kill them and sacrifice the previous kills loot for a better chance at the next kill having a unique or the pet. Jad and Zuk could have a right click instance to scale up their enrage too.

fpa781,shlongitude,Barrows Cape?,"Just wondering what other people's thoughts would be on a barrows cape?  


I  thought there needed to be a colour-appropriate cape that looks the right fit to match any of the barrows sets should you choose to wear them. Currently there is no cape that has a colour scheme that matches barrows.  


Some cool ideas I thought of would be that you have to kill every brother and get 100% in the kill-potential to hit the roll table for a barrows cape, maybe a 1/512 drop or something; Make it highly sought after? Perhaps it gives an amplifying effect of the current set of barrows items equipped to make them even stronger?  


e.g.   
\- Attack 1-tick faster with a veracs flail?  
\- dharoks 1.25x increased damage per 1% missing health?  
\- ahrims 25% chance to decrease strength and defence by 5 levels  
\- karils current effect plus 25% chance to increase run energy by 10%  
\- guthans has a 50% chance to health your health at 75% of the dmg you dealt an enemy.  
\- torags current effect + unique ability to corrupt your opponent with dread for 10 seconds, which would make them take DoT damage whenever they move; possibly 2-3 dmg per tile they move? it would make torags a pvp-viable option (can only inflict dread on another player once every 30 seconds).  
to balance out the cape you could make it so that when it's equipped, all equipped barrows items degrade at twice the speed (the cape included). Could also buff the cape by being able to offer any 20 barrows items to the mysterious groundskeeper on the barrows hills to permanently imbue your barrows cape so that it never degrades; your regular barrows equipment would still decay at twice the rate tho.

fp9ar3,scorehelm,How casual friendly is ironman?,"Over the past few months I've been playing runescape3 ironman. I've always loved solo self found versions of any game, So naturally I was inclined to do the same here. Im still uncertain if ironman has effected this but I've found Rs3 to be such an overly complex game. I had to watch a  tutorial on how to use the UI alone!! My sheer lack of knowledge has really been an obvious draw back and at times demotivated me to play, most people are helpful but I get so stuck I dont even know what to be asking. 


I recently discovered why the home page says there's 160,000 people on but it really doesn't feel like the world's are that populated... well the rs3 population is the old school population minus what says on the home page... kinda missleading. 


I'm keen to see what the hype is, and id love to try ironman but I hear everything is wayyyy slower and grindier on osrs.

Step 1: go onto runebet.com and go to dice staking against other real players this is a 50/50 chance to win 
Step 2: add some money from osrs to the website the more you add the faster you make money can be done with as low as 3.6m but is most effective with about 36m (adding to ur account is not bannable as rwt involves them giving you money or the other way round this site has been around ages u can’t get banned) 

Step 3: once your on dice duels bet an amount dependsing on how much you
Added eg. If you added 3.6m then bet 100k if you win bet another 100k if you lose bet 200k if you lose that then bet 400k and if you will bet 100k and so on 

The only way this method wouldn’t work is if you get extremely unlucky which is extremely hard I’ve been doing this 2 days but in amounts of 1m and have made 70 m so far I’m not sponsored by them I’m just sharing to help you guys any questions feel free to comment below I will reply to all 🙂🙂",0,1585216495,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fp8uz3/runbet_money_making/,2007scape,1

If you have found yourself saying ""I really enjoy this game but there just seems like there is way more fun with people do to stuff with"" this is the place for you.

While we are still only about 30 members currently, we are well on our way to being active for events and consistent bossing teams. More recently we have been teaching new members how to do both CoX and ToB.

At the moment we are holding an event with prizes for recruiting new members, a bingo for PvM, and a skilling event soon for those interested.

(It's also worth mentioning that the name is not weed related, this seems to have been a problem for some)

There are no requirements to join but if you are straight off of tutorial island it may be a little while before you are able to participate in some group activities.

Should I be unpref'ing things like black demons/nec/dust devils? I had black demons pref'd because I like doing demonic gorillas a lot.

But due to the randomness of konor, maybe it's best to unpref all 3 of them? Or maybe just unpref black demons and just skip necs and dust devils if I don't get them in the catacombs?

Just wondering. I am also semi-aware of a method where people just get rid of their task streak, but idk how I feel about that nor am I fully aware of how much better it is compared to just doing tasks and skipping the absolute awful tasks (abby demons in the abyss ewww).

fp7kud,Buhdumtssss,Revive the wildy: fix OSRS's draw distance,"Note: this mainly applies to people who go into the wild for things other than clue scrolls

During normal gameplay you don't really notice this, but it's obvious the second you do anything like wilderness slayer or KBD. OSRS's draw distance is flat out bad, and because of how draw distance works, and because of how bad it is, you are almost always at a disadvantage depending on what you're doing.

So what do I mean by ""it's bad""? Using runelite, I can render double, triple, or even more of the map beyond what I can actually see. I can render the GE from edgeville but won't see a player past the furnace. Draw distance is effectively limited to either exactly or slightly larger than spellcast range. Ok, so what? 

So essentially, that means ***if I can see you I can hit you.*** Anyone who's even casually played MMOs, MOBAS, RPGs, even FPS games should see the issue immediately. At best, you have 2 squares to react, most of the time you have none at all. Anyone who's been in the wild *I can guarantee* has died from this. There's no such thing as ""seeing"" a PKer, you're already fighting. Basically, you've lost your ability to react. You're face-checking everywhere you go. 

To make things worse, mobs you may be attacking can render for an opponent, letting them know you're there, while still outside of your draw. Cannonballs can hit mobs *literally 1 1/2 your draw distance* without you being able to see the damage they take or where they even are. Add to this your opponent's advantage. Suddenly, someone doing ice warrior slayer at the fence can be spotted by a PKer ***at the Lava Maze.*** 

Suddenly, it became obvious why nobody likes the wildy. You're one square away from an entire team loading into your game, with zero time to react, and zero chance to do anything but run. It's all basically become hovering over the logout button and hoping your ping is better than theirs. 

It became obvious why not many people do wildy slayer, which is actually hella fun, when they get TBed by someone ***they can't even see,*** and that knew you were there 2 minutes ago.

I understand that Jagex needs to limit high draws at places like the GE and POHs, but in the middle of nowhere deep wilderness, there's zero excuse for not giving me at least 2x magic range to spot someone. There's no reason my cannon should be hitting mobs I can't even see. Fog of War doesn't = attack range. Make it so anyone who can see mobs I'm hitting are also spotted, or a similar mechanic.

There's many other issues that come from this, like getting ranged/maged in fight caves by mobs x2 your vision, but this post is too long already.

It look me 10 wildy slayer tasks to figure out why the wildy is dead, and it really doesn't have a lot to do with clans or PKers or rewards or loot; it all comes back to fundamentals.",32,1585209174,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fp7kud/revive_the_wildy_fix_osrss_draw_distance/,2007scape,1

Some ppl train skills for pvm cos they HAVE to, not because they enjoy it. Let's be honest, most skills in this game are downright boring and slow to train.

No wonder so many people bot in this game, disregarding gold farmers.

Pvm boosts in diaries should be locked behind requirements such as KC or kill x boss in under x amount of time.

There should be hiscores for boss/raids PBs which actually take skill, not just for who can sit on their computer for the longest and repeat the same action for a long time",13,1585190783,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fp3sna/why_lock_pvm_content_behind_skills/,2007scape,1

fp2k8i,OfficerTom,Recommended starting stats for Rune Dragon alt,"I did some tinkering with the DPS calc spreadsheet and came up with these numbers which are ideal beginning stats for a rune dragon alt. This assumes a max justiciar setup (fire cape, torture, dfs, ferocious, berserker imbue). Want to share in case somebody else finds it useful.

87 Attack - For some reason has a substantially larger accuracy boost than nearby increments, .1dps over 86 which is equivalent to the difference between 87 and 90. Diminishing returns all the way up

92 Strength - there is a +2 max hit increment at 91 strength, 92 allows dosing every 2 stat drops, saving an inventory space of another super combat. Alternatively start at 91 and use divines until level up

Defense should be linear so no notable advice. By my rough estimate 80 def vs 99 is \~5% profit/hr so you'll certainly get better returns out of atk/str levels, but afk time is good too.

To compare, at 99s you will get only 15% more DPS while requiring an additional 120+ hours of NMZ. If you do have time for more NMZ after starting RDs, I'd recommend leveling attack before strength since you will gain more dps / lvl. Next max hit is at 94 for divines or 95 otherwise.",4,1585185818,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fp2k8i/recommended_starting_stats_for_rune_dragon_alt/,2007scape,1

foxmyq,hottestniel,Unpopular Opinion: The popular method of killing corp is broken and makes corp not even a boss.,"I dont get how corp hasn't had any changes despite being incredibly flawed. Currently the popular method is speccing down the boss to 0 stats so that you can literally afk the fight. This isnt what a boss fight should be-- especially not corp.  Ironmen also use this to get easy kills since they can have a better iron friend spec it down for them.  

Corp should get a rework to regen its stats when you leave the room. Aswell as maybe allowing groups of ironmen to still get loot so that they have an option besides speccing.

foxcz5,akidandadream,FOSSIL REWORK PLEASE,"Hey guys,

I know we have been hearing for a long time to hold onto our fossils because an update should come eventually but this seems to not be the case with all other things being prioritized. I think Jagex should take the time to rework what we can do with our left over fossils from Fossil Island. I am aware there is an option to turn them in for prayer xp but this content is pretty much useless as no high level accounts are taking the time to farm fossils for prayer. Alot of the people with hundreds of left over fossils are skillers who did 99 woodcutting here and dont want the prayer xp. or they are low level obby builds who used the museum to get their slayer staffs. Either release a low level boss we can kill to get more xp lamps or add an NPC we can trade these in to for smaller xp lamps focused on skills. Limiting it to prayer is just useless content for most of the players acquiring them on fossil island.

They can keep the prayer option available but add onto the options we can potentially use it on. 

TLDR: Extra fossils being limited to just prayer causes alot of the content to go to waste as alot of us are pures or skillers and dont want the prayer xp or useless numelite.

When I play Runescape I often bring my cat with me for the fun of it, so I feel like my character is more like me; doing a mundane task by myself listening to Sea Shanty 2 in the dark. 

But, I'm not the biggest fan of his coat and I want more variety in my life. Except, when I go to the cat bitch she has the fucking gall to tell me I can only have one. What is this, West Ardougne? I have a gigantic house and I've built like a thousand chairs for plenty of cats to ignore me on. 

Every now and then I even screw with splashers in Lumbridge and give him a nice fresh meal. Why? Because I drink a lot and I'm an asshole. But I'm not enough of an asshole to sell my cat for blood runes! I just want to have more cats! I don't feel like that's too much to ask!

I have literally every bit of info etc. that could be needed because it is actually my account lol, but I have no way to give that info. I tried twitter, but not sure how reliable of a method that is. Does anyone else have any ideas or input? I'm sure I've even posted stuff about my ironman on this reddit itself over the past few years. I kinda just want to try to get like in chat with a real Jagex support member or something, so I can give all of the info I have at once, instead of like 1/10th of it in a really short form.",0,1585160038,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fov4yj/account_recovery/,2007scape,1

fov2yw,007chill,Helping friends get started in OldSchool RuneScape. My Quick Guide I've assembled with a bit of help. Anything I should add?,"**My Guide to teaching Old School RuneScape**

My friends will not be given this large document. This is a list of things I will be explaining and showing to them about the game. I will ask them to complete Tutorial Island without me to get a feel for the controls and some basic skilling/combat mechanics. I'm hoping that my walkthrough will take less than an hour to do. If you see anything that you think needs added or removed, please let me know - and feel free to use this if you are looking to teach someone RS!

**Point of the Game**

* The game is a sandbox. You can do literally whatever you want to do
* Skilling, Combat, PvM (Player vs Monster), PvP (Player vs Player), Questing, Playing alone, Playing with groups, Achievement hunting, Challenging yourself, Making money
* Setting and completing goals, sense of accomplishment. Delayed gratification.
* Relaxing when you don’t want to focus on a high intensity game (but there are things in the game that do require a good amount of skill and focus)

**Skills Tab - Rundown of the game interface**

* Have them click a few skills and show them that it unlocks certain things at each level
IE - for attack, at 10 you get black weapons
* Defense - different armors at each level
* Show Fremennik helms require Trials (a quest) which is how quests fit into the game
* Show cooking and fishing, as you level up you can cook/fish different things that make training faster. Skills intertwine with eachother
Right click - wiki
* Wiki shows training methods &amp; info about the skill

**Quest Tab**

* Explain the point of quests
* Some quests are singular, some have storylines and multiple parts (Monkey Madness, Fremennik series)
* Show a quest with skill requirements (Animal Magnetism)
* Show quests that unlock specific gear (Family Crest)
* Explain that quests are free exp, especially early levels can dramatically speed up starting an account
* Show to right click a quest and open the wiki guide
* **Achievement Diaries**
* * Extra tasks to do in certain area
* * Allows for people to be well-rounded if not particular on any skill
* * Unlocks items/perks that are very beneficial even at end game
* **Mini-games**
* * Teleports are very useful
* *Some unlock very good (free) gear (Barb assault)

**Inventory**

* Show that anything you pick up goes into your inventory
* Drop things
* This is where you can use things on the other (this is done in tutorial island, when they made a fire + bread)



**Equipment Tab**

* Show how to unequip items
* Show stats of gear you’re wearing

**Prayers**

* Stat boosts within combat for the most part
* Protection Prayers
* Run down on combat styles in the game
* Recharge prayer at an altar or with prayer potions

**Spellbook**

* Show that hovering over spells tells you which level requirement it is and what runes it takes (kind of like the skills tab for magic)
* Spells will be highlighted when you can cast them
* Home teleport to get back to Lumbridge in a pinch/if lost

**Combat Options Tab**

* Show that different attack styles train different stats
* Auto Retaliate explanation

**Minimap and Orbs**

* Shows your current HP, prayer points, and run energy
* The Globe opens up the world map
* Wiki button integration


**Playing the Game - The Plan**

* Expand the game screen from fixed
* Middle mouse button to rotate camera, zoom in and out with scroll wheel
* Turn off game sounds
* Give them 100-250k? Early game moneymaking is bad and would get them start with supplies for early quests. (+ Bond to counter G/E new account timer) This shows them how to trade with others
* Show them the bank, how to find bank on the minimap/map
* Tell them if they die, they have an hour to reclaim items. It’s not a big deal to die! It happens to everyone.
* Do a Witches potion with them to show how quests can level you up. Collect the items ourselves for this quest.
* Have them open up the guide for Doric’s Quest
* This quest requires ores and clay
* Head to the Grand Exchange and show them how to buy the supplies needed
* Tell them to Ignore spammers and gambling bots - they are scams. People scam a lot. It’s an MMO. Don’t trust people is a good rule of thumb.
* Walk to Doric and complete the quest
*Explain that it can be done faster with teleports - and the importance of training magic as well as tabs and jewelry 
* Show them how to train melee, range, and magic at cowpen
* Can also show how monsters are not smart and get trapped behind objects
* Explain how to eat food to heal yourself - give a few trout/bread for this
* Explain hopping worlds / logging out
* * If there are many players in a spot, you can hop worlds to find a less crowded place to train
* Explain the Wilderness
* * Don’t go over the ditch with items

**Runelite**

* Open source game client made by the community to increase the quality of life in the game
* Show a couple plugins - stat lookup, exp tracker, show how to edit ground items
* Can turn off and on any plugins that you want.
* Sign in to save all settings
 
Mobile client if they are interested. It is the base client so won’t have all the cool features but it runs really well and is free. Same account that you’re playing with on PC.",0,1585159849,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fov2yw/helping_friends_get_started_in_oldschool/,2007scape,1

Yet I maxed sooner than I would have if I had only played using EHP methods. What I am getting at is that there is a concept that I call ""macro efficiency"" where if you are doing methods that fit best into gaining the most xp per week, etc. you are actually being as efficient as possible.

A good example of this is zeah rc. I can get hundreds of thousands of xp in a day yet if I go tryhard on normal rc I barely can scrape those numbers. Something always comes up. Reality is a factor.

fosuoc,rophl,PSA: If the drop rate is 1/N then the average number of kills you need is N,"Seen a few posts on here talking about drop rates and percentages with loads of numbers and tables and needless complexity.

Skip all that, it's actually really simple:

**If the drop rate of some item is 1/N then you will need N kills to get it** (on average).

If you already have lots of kills but no drop, then it's still simple:

**You will need another N kills** (on average).

What does on average mean? If you and your best chums go and kill abyssal demons until each of you gets a whip (drop chance = 1/512), then average out how many kills each of you got individually, the result will be roughly 512.

Why does the number stay the same after getting kills? Because each roll on the drop table is independent. If your very best chum Bob has been killing abyssal demons for weeks and you just started now, you both have the same number of kills in your future.

**MATHS ALERT**

This is called the expected value of the bernoulli process. Links are banned here so maybe you want to google those. Basically, you take your probability of getting the drop on the n^th kill, multiply it by the number of kills it took to get there and then sum over all n. I'm going to start using p = 1/N because it's easier on the eyes. The chance of not getting the drop on any particular kill is (1 - p). The chance of reaching kill n is (1-p)^(n-1) because you have to not get the drop (n-1) times in order to reach it. The chance of getting the drop on kill n is p times that, so p * (1-p)^(n-1). Multiply by the n and sum and you get Σ n * p * (1-p)^(n-1) which you bung into wolfram alpha and get the result 1/p, also known as N.",14,1585152386,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fosuoc/psa_if_the_drop_rate_is_1n_then_the_average/,2007scape,1

If you do a lot of Nightmare and can afford to choose between a scythe and mace, the mace is absolutely worth it at its current price. It would only take about 80 hours of nightmare before the scythe ends up costing more than the mace (which can be sold back), and they seem to do identical dps. The only reason to use the scythe is if you have full inquisitor. 

Also, out of all the inquisitor items I’m expecting the mace to hold a high price for the longest time because it’s very rare at 1/1,200 (on average, 2 orbs will drop for every mace that drops).",17,1585149122,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/forx6p/til_inquisitors_mace_does_similar_dps_to_scythe/,2007scape,1

fopw8z,Tr0llsauce,Where were you 5 years back?,"Dear Runescapians,

Sorry for my English in advance, English is not my mother tongue.

I can remember it, like it was yesterday. 5 years ago, I was a unschooled no-one sitting at home. I didn't do anything other than playing games and going to the gym. My life has drastically changed from then and now.

In fact, I started studying electric engineer and within a year after I completed the study (I did evening study and work 40hrs a week) I became a head Electrician where I work. 
That's not the only change;
I found beautiful wife and got 2 children with her. 
My behavior and visions changed like the speed of light travels. Still I am not near, where I want to be. But that's another story.

Nonetheless, I want to say sorry to every Runescape player and staff member; I was very toxic back then and didn't realize how annoying it is to be with someone that toxic. My account got banned back then and I do agree with the ban. Yet I feel the urge to play the game again, and want to ask for forgiveness one more time. I will deal 100% with the answer given. 

Stay safe during these Corona times everyone!

foot0k,abdullaBM1,Bank organization - SUGGESTION,"Hey guys, long time lurker and i finally decided to make a suggestion that would help people who like to organize their banks. 

So here is the idea

You open your bank, everything is still where you left it BUT we will have a button that  will give us a **clean version** of our existing bank, with no items whatsoever

from there on you could ""search""for items just like you would in the GE, and then click on whatever item you please, doing so will result in the item being in your inventory. from there you could organize the bank as you please.

and when your finished, the layout you have in your ""bank editor""will override your current bank layout, resulting in the items being re-positioned and whatever item you dont own would have a placeholder instead, 

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/jkvZgrt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jkvZgrt.jpg)) I drew that using paint to show where the button could be

Would really like your thoughts and if someone has a better idea please tell us !

I know it would be hard to implement but i'll appreciate the feedback

I was playing this game today because I remembered it from when I was a kid. Honestly I am writing this post to both thank the community as well. I just came to the grand exchange to check out what it was. Two kind individuals by the name of L00kingMolly and Digargoz approached me and traded me. They gave me items and money to help me out, for absolutely nothing! They also gave me advice on how I should be using a leather body instead of my rune iron platebody for ranged. I didn't know how to re-pay their kindness, or any of the other strangers that has helped me so far. Another person by the username Ryan Garland also gave me a bunch of arrows when he saw I was using iron arrows at hill giants. I want to thank this community as a whole and all the nice individuals out there helping new players.

fol1ae,Reclypso,Potential problem with exchangeable crystal seeds,"So with this new update you can trade crystal weapon, tool, and armor seeds to an npc for crystal shards. Those crystal shards can be then used to make enhanced crystal keys which give 500 xp in crafting and smithing per key. You can make a whole invy of 27 keys with one click giving you 13.5k in crafting AND smithing. The bank is 5-6 seconds away from the crystal singing bowl, even calculated at 25 second bank runs (Which is really slow) it's about 2m exp in crafting AND smithing exp per hour. This method would be fairly expensive but you do get a little cash back from opening the enhanced crystal chests and there isn't much data showing the average loot of the chest but my calculations show it would cost around 150m-250m per hour using the method (Buying crystal tool seeds and crystal weapon seeds 100 shards ea/10 shards ea). There are limits on the ge for these items (70 for weapon seeds 100 for tool seeds) but several hours worth of singing should be buyable within a day or two and faster with multiple accounts. Although this method is very expensive it has high exp rewards and may be worth it for some very rich players. My suggestion is to allow only a few keys to be made at a time with a short delay like any other smithing/crafting skill.",5,1585115002,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fol1ae/potential_problem_with_exchangeable_crystal_seeds/,2007scape,1

fojnzu,braylmao,[Suggestion] Deadman Mode,"Deadman Mode is both an annually permanent and a monthly seasonal quarterly temporary variant of Old School RuneScape that released on the 29th of October 2015. A separate server is hosted featuring an open PvP environment, with some exceptions. Players in-game can speak to Nigel in Lumbridge graveyard for information about Deadman Mode.

Experience gained in Deadman mode is 5x more than usual (10x during the first six hours of gameplay, and 20x during the first 30 minutes); however, experience that is gained from quests will not be multiplied. In addition, experience will not be gained in instanced areas (such as the Nightmare Zone and TzHaar Fight Caves).

Every player begins their adventure at combat level 3, and progress in Old School RuneScape, or any other game (RuneScape 3, RuneScape Classic, etc.), will not be affected. All content is only available to pay-to-play players.

Upon killing a player, they may receive blood money. One is received per kill, and can be used to purchase Deadman armour from Nigel in the Lumbridge graveyard. It has the same bonuses as iron armour. A total of three are required to purchase the Deadman's chest, Deadman's legs, and Deadman's cape. These can be reclaimed for free should a player die.",1,1585108384,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fojnzu/suggestion_deadman_mode/,2007scape,1

fohdo5,Krellggs,Need help 1-tick prayer flicking (during peak hours),"Is there a flicking technique I can use during peak hours, or is flicking just not possible during then?

I'm fairly new to the game, and recently I've learned how to 1-tick prayer flick. Flicking can help me get through a slayer task in a single trip without needing expensive prayer potions. Unfortunately, my ability to flick seems to rely entirely on the time of day. During peak hours, it seems almost impossible to flick. I cannot get it to ""sync up"", and if I do, it'll only last for about 5 flicks until its out of sync again. On the other hand, when servers aren't so busy, I can flick non-stop without issue throughout an entire task. I have RuneLite and I can see the server pings, so I'm sure it's not a ping issue.

Also: from my understanding, they left flicking in the game because it's seen as a high-skill mechanic for players to gain an advantage, but to me it seems rather unfair that such an important mechanic is so heavily reliant on ping and server quality. Should it be changed or reworked somehow?",6,1585098818,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fohdo5/need_help_1tick_prayer_flicking_during_peak_hours/,2007scape,1

foh7fr,Bloo-Goose,Loot from 70-99 Ranged at Hellhounds,"Hey Everyone,

I made an account just to afk hellhounds and do hard clue scrolls. Here is my loot from 70-99 Ranged.

Data:

248 hard clues completed 

\~25531 Hellhounds killed

94,523 broad bolts fletched costing 5,435,091 gp to make

I alched all rune items

I started killing hellhounds at 70 range. I stayed at hellhounds almost entirely until 99.  However, I did have to kill saradomin wizards, zamorakian wizards, and uri to complete hard clues, accounting for approximately 150k additional ranged exp.  I also killed \~700 blue dragons to get 60 prayer to wield a crozier to complete a clue step, accounting for approximately 300kexp. Subtracting this exp and the exp from 1-70 range from the exp to get 99 range is how I calculated how many Hellhounds I killed. 

Overall my luck is not that good, however my,... goal is to just get a mega rare. After that I will adjust the future of this account.",6,1585098129,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/foh7fr/loot_from_7099_ranged_at_hellhounds/,2007scape,1

fofxr7,Rubber-duckling,Nightmare zone contracts For the REAL boss fights.,"Currently the nightmare zone minigame is just used as a one way ticket to max melee stats. While this is okay and allot of people do this most people there are bots for staking and account sales.

While I’m not against the easy training location I believe there is so much more potential for the whole fighting old quest bosses idea.  
While we have the old minigame where we aren't spending supplies on I believe having a new minigame where we actually fight the bosses in their original location with our own supplies would be allot of fun.  
I also don't want the old Nmz to be removed and this should just be another option.

Nightmare zone contracts would be like farming contracts.  
 You talk to Dominic Onion for a new Contract you drink from the vial and there you go its time to fight Galvek.  
 Kill Galvek and get rewarded with points to imbue your gear and buy herb boxes.

There should be 2 types of contracts normal and hard.

This might be a good gold sink buy yourself in with 100k/1million gold and if you die you lose the money if you succeed you get the points and money back.  
100k for a normal contract and 1million for a hard Maybe the payment can be with Nmz points themselves.  
When balancing this minigame it should be allot better than the 1164k points I can currently get in the Nmz.  
NOTE: I get 1164k points an hour on average in Nmz this doesn’t mean everyone gets this.  
Some of the bosses i had in mind.  
Glough, Kruk, Treus Dayth, Elven Traitor, Essyllt, Fragment of Seren, Vorkath, Galvek, Arzinian avatar, Delrith, Draugen, Glod, Jungle demon, Ranis Drakan, Slash bash, Tolna, the Dagannoth mother with her child and of course the whole Dream mentor boss fight.",14,1585093399,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fofxr7/nightmare_zone_contracts_for_the_real_boss_fights/,2007scape,1

fofcs5,darksoulsfinalboss,Another shady pvp situation for you all to be made aware of,"So I was the guy that posted about the fishing guild safe spots that a couple days before sir puggers vid, which got popular. Since his video obviously was more detailed than a reddit post, I removed it. Anyway, here's another shady pvp situation some of you might find yourselves in because it preys mostly upon newer pvmers.

# The Wilderness God Wars Skull Trick

You're doing wildy skayer or hunting ecumenical keys, whatever. Soemone will scout you. A pker will log in, pker A, and teleblock you and the scout and start attacking you. 

Now this guy can be venge, claw, gmauled, and elder mauled for about 5m. I've killed 2 of them so far, but I only felt confident doing it because I've got hundreds and hundreds of hours in pvp.

Anyway, he'll try pretend you're owning him and attempt to flee via one of the exits of wildy godwars. Right away you should wondering why he doesnt teleport out if he's really appearing to panic.. red flag. He'll move through the crevice and this is when the skull trick occurs. When your attack line of sight has been broken, they'll switch the account for a similarly geared and similar appearing RSN hoping you'll attack this account thinking it was the one attacking you. People hardly ever notice they've skulled until it's too late and they've lost their items. 

So be careful. A lot of these skull tricks work because people are naive and inexperienced in PvP. The sense pf honourable conduct you might expect from pvp, just like the old days is gone and buried.

My advice is, if you have less than 10-30 legitimate kills in PvP via the NH tribridding fighting style in the wilderness itself and not just LMS, then just don't attack anyone in the wilderness unless you're willing to lose your shit.",7,1585091363,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fofcs5/another_shady_pvp_situation_for_you_all_to_be/,2007scape,1

fof8wo,justanotherguyirl,Settle an internet debate,"So a buddy of mine and I went to bandos.  Ofc with the COVID-19 quarantine everyone and their grandmother is playing osrs so we kept getting crashed.  We eventually find a free world and continue killing until 3 level 113's come in and \*attempt\* to crash us.  We were getting around 80% of the kills until we were running out of supplies and my buddy decides that he doesn't want to waste his time anymore by risking the chance of them getting something good so he leaves.  I decide to stay for one more kill and sure enough I get the drop and it's a BCP.  He's upset that I haven't split the loot with him but I feel like he's full of shit.  On an unrelated note, his bank is worth quadruple mine.

foez8u,18houston2,Skull Tricks Involving Similar Names in Wilderness,"This post is meant to be for advice as well as other people's opinions on the subject. Here is the common situation I am talking about: While doing something (slaying, pvm, high-alching..) in the wilderness unskulled, you are attacked. Attacker skulls, leaves frame, and then moments later (unbeknownst to you) a different player with a practically identical name walks back into frame. You attack, and BAM, get an unwanted skulled.  This can happen even if you have Player-Right-Click on.

To me, it seems too easy for wilderness clans with large player bases (easy to find 2 pkers with similar levels) to skull trick this way, especially given how easy it is to change In Game Name nowadays.

Skulls are supposed to penalize the offensive players in the wilderness, but this skull trick seems to penalize players who don't have access to clans or something.. If I was in charge, I would do something like put a high price on name changes, to reduce the frequency of this trick.

What do you think? also.. COVIDDDDDDD",16,1585090042,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/foez8u/skull_tricks_involving_similar_names_in_wilderness/,2007scape,1

fobamr,NoMoreSoftwareGore,Item idea: a flag that you can place that proves you were 'resetting aggro' and are not crashing someone's training spot,"As I WFH I have my character training strength at the west side ammonite crabs on another monitor, and it's insane just how often people will log in at the exact time you are resetting aggro. Most people are respectful and believe you, but are also suspicious that you may be lying to them just to take their spot. I've gone through this like 4-5 times in the last 5 hours I've been afking this.

What if we could place down a flag that you can read that shows the user of the person who placed it, and that will start counting back from 60 seconds the moment that player leaves from within X amount of spaces away from it. You now have a way of proving that you were there less than 60 seconds ago, so there's never any doubt that you were in fact just resetting. You could also have a readable timestamp on the flag that shows how long it's been since it's been placed.

I know you don't own a spot just because you are there, but at least it would help with helping other players showing that they weren't lying.",2,1585077819,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fobamr/item_idea_a_flag_that_you_can_place_that_proves/,2007scape,1

foarlw,wealldie1day,Still waiting for that PvP rejuvenation Jagex... we have been asking since 2015...,"Promised since 2015. Finally some actual steps in 2020. Except you remove Bounty Hunter and now you're removing PvP worlds? Is this RS2? Where's the transparency in the content you plan to replace these activities with? This time, maybe before you take out part of the game and force the already struggling community to relocate and quit.

BH2 was shit because the tasks weren't designed to ehance PvP. They were bs stupid tasks that did nothing to play around the various builds, metas and styles of PvP inherent to BH. Not to mention, the design blunder of making a system so abusable by bot and gold farmers and with an obvious boost meta.

LMS is pretty shit too for actual established pkers. Sure it's fun, but the mode is either dead or plagued by bots. There's no build variety. There's no map variety. The maps are too big and the team sizes to start are too big. The cosmetic rewards shouldn't be locked by competitive, so the casual mode isn't as dead either. The rewards are trash anyway, but it's pretty understandable why. If they're good, they won't pass a poll. If they're bad, they'll pass a poll and be dead content. If it's boostable, bottable or gold farmable, then that happens if it passes polling. Activities that reward players should at minimum be in the wildy and be a net loss for 2 or more accounts to farm (i.e. 100k buy in between 2 accounts and the winner gets 25k for winning, with the loser getting nothing as an EXAMPLE).

* How are you guys still so out of touch with your player base and with PvP content? 
* Why are you still struggling with the idea that if you want PvP updates, they have to be unpolled and generate no wealth outside killing a target for their loot? 
* Why is there no elo system? An outlast build will only work.
* Why is PvP only afforded 1 devs spare time?

# Some suggestions that'd be pretty damned nice to see

* Buff wilderness slayer for gp/hr for people risking X amount of actual gp in their invent (i.e. like 5m cash) and reward keeping the wildy slayer streak.
* In combination with the above. Add a new solo-pking activity that pulls mechanics from BH. Such as being assigned a target on any world, so long as you're on the same world and being able to teleport to them with a HUD telling you their name, risked wealth, whether they are in or near multi combat.
* Add a pj and immunity timer to a small section from the 44s teleport spot to KBD and at the spot immediately west of the carralanger graves teleport.
* Fix magic defence/accuracy calculations.
* Nerf the Bulwark. Its physical defences are too high and its lack of negative magic defence, combined with black dhide is actually broken for a game with no weapons to counter the shield. People say bring more risk to kill bulwark tanks, but then singles teams hound you. Pkers that fight back are usually baits for a team, so solo-pkers either quit or kill non-pkers. Having non-pkers is essential for a healthy wilderness, regardless of what reddit says. This idea that you're not allowed to kill non-pkers is absurd and they should never have been in a position to be invincible; there's no risk regardless and plenty of reward. It should always be dangerous to be in the wildy, not a snooze fest with shield.
* Nerf black dhides and equalise the DPS more between the combat styles. Praying range the whole fight and melee against specs isn't enjoyable. Yes magic has a utility value, but it's also the reason nh TRIbridding is stale since magic isn't a DPS threat unless you're in ancestral and other dmg boosting BIS. Damage boosting gear should never have been added to balance out DPS over a magic rework.",4,1585076124,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/foarlw/still_waiting_for_that_pvp_rejuvenation_jagex_we/,2007scape,1

Maybe also add some higher requirement to have the ability to do so if people think it's too ez scape. 

I am for sure bias regards this, because I'm just bored of getting multiple ring imbues. It takes no skill and it's boring, I just want to get back to pking faster.

- Clue scroll obtained through pking/ [BH target];
- Highly valuable loot table; 
- Non-tradeable but can be transferred via death mechanics i.e. pked;
- wilderness based tasks e.g. performing skills in hotspot areas, killing NPCs;

I got banned for RWT in 2012. I sold a significant amount gold. During which time, I traded some of the same accounts that a high profile mustang enthusiast did. Following recent accusations by the community against the same player, I ask you to check his account history. The information is there.  


The account, owned by the biggest gold buyer at the time, had a rare name which is why I can remember it. One time I stood right behind him and had to wait for him to finish trading.  


To be honest, I've always been a little salty that he got away with it. I've chalked it down to him having a big fan on the inside because it would be blatantly obvious to anybody doing a proper check on his account and there is no fucking way he could have gotten away with it for this long.  


I do believe that he stopped selling gold around the time that Twitch became prominent though.

So.. the UK is in a technical lockdown, what better way to pass the time? OSRS! Only problem is i've had 2-3 years off the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Please can you answer a few of these questions:

\- What is the best 3rd party client?  Are 3rd party clients still allowed/used? (I used OSBuddy Pro)

\- Understandably there will have been many updates, what is the one thing you feel that I should get to know once I start back?  (126 combat, 1.8k total) 

\- Are there still loads of bots?

\- Are buyables still expensive? (as they were around 2016/17?)

I have about 25m left on it to invest. I was thinking to get void and go for MM2 to chin my range as high as I can. Inevitably I want to bolster stats to do raids and just bossing in general.

fo1lff,dolphin-eater,My ironman has been hacked," 

Yesterday, 23th of march I was playing osrs on my main an on my ironman. It was dinnertime so I logged out of both accounts. After dinner I come back to my pc and I can’t log in to my ironman anymore, I can log in to my main. I tried everything, re-typing password, re-typing e-mail. Nothing worked so tried to go the “forgot password” route. It didn’t recognize my e-mail address.  
Next I tried to log in via mobile, since there my ironman is automatically logged in.  
There I stand at pest control bank with an empty bank, 1B bank gone.  
[https://imgur.com/gallery/kNQVwDX](https://imgur.com/gallery/kNQVwDX)   
Now, for my security measures, I thought I was safe.  
I have a 2-step authentication on my phone to log into osrs. I have a bank pin set on to my account. I use an e-mail address that I only use for my osrs account. I use a password only used for this specific account.

I filled in the recovery form found on the RuneScape form to see if I could get my log-in details back or changed. Next I checked my e-mail, and there had been suspicious activity just five minutes after I had left for dinner. There had been a successful log-in from the ip-address: 207.244.78.96  
This is an ip-address from the US, that is very strange because I am from the Netherlands.  
I next checked to see if I had visited any strange links or had any strange downloads, none.  
No, I have never shared my account of have logged in to osrs via free Wi-Fi.

My question here is, how could they get into my account? How could they have cracked my bank-pin? Why did they get into my ironsmans account and not my main?  
But most important of all, is there a way I can get my account back and how can I make sure this doesn't happen again next time?

ps. It is very strange I am still able to log into my account via mobile even after log-in has changed.

thanks for reading, Thommmy

fo0an3,AKWrestle,OSRS Economy in 2030,"OSRS will probably still be around in another decade, given that it’s thriving now almost 2 decades after its release.

The player base is still relatively young, mostly those in their 20’s and 30’s. In another decade, a huge chunk of the player base should theoretically have a lot of disposable income along with an OSRS addiction.

How prevalent would “whale accounts” be in 2030, where people just buy/hoard GP and the meta combat equipment. Do you think it will change the game, such as PvP/bossing, or am I thinking too deeply into this. 

If you think the economy will be different, how do you think it’ll be fixed? Would there be means to make the game less of a grind so whale players don’t feel the need to power level/buy gold to skip to the end game? Would there be trade restrictions? To put it into perspective, if someone had a large disposable income and a family, they probably wouldn’t want to spend hundreds of hours making a new pure account and grinding the same quests over again just to high-risk PK in a certain combat bracket... many would just whale out and by 2030, I speculate osrs could be looking at an economy dominated by whales at its current state.",1,1585031072,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fo0an3/osrs_economy_in_2030/,2007scape,1

fnxkos,BlueberrySB,What makes you keep playing OSRS?,"I get a lot of questions from people around me. My brother, my girlfriend, my friends, even my dad (basically strictly plays CoD) on why I play OSRS. 

They ask what I'm playing, and I explain to them what it is. Usually a skill like Fishing or Woodcutting will get their attention, ""You can catch fish?"" With a little excitement in their voice. Then once I explain how to do it and that you mostly don't even have to pay attention it's the same answer ""That seems so boring.""

Which after countless responses like that got me thinking ""Why do I play RuneScape?"" So I'll go first.

I think I play for 2 reasons. The first is simply nostalgia. I feel like that's a lot of people's reason/one of them. But I think for myself the other is this undying need to know something is finished. That's how I've always been. Even if I hate a game's campaign and I started it. I have to finish it. Even if my save gets corrupted after 60+ hours of playing I have to start over and finish it. Which brings me to OSRS. I know I'm level 90 in a skill? Gotta finish it and get it to 99. Got 30 more quests to go before all the quests are done? Have to get them all done. Have a few more tasks for a hard diary to be done? You guessed it. Have to finish it out. But I think what makes me come back over and over how rewarding of a feeling ""finishing"" a skill or quests or clue scrolls or diaries actually is. You have to put so many hours into this game to be even halfway maxed. And that's what I love about it. 

So why do you guys play OSRS?",20,1585018408,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnxkos/what_makes_you_keep_playing_osrs/,2007scape,1

My guess is that people think it's fine and/or didn't want to devalue the saradomin godsword? That's really all I can think of and prayer tends to be trivial due to people flicking for infinite prayer.

I guess the Inquisitor passed because it doesn't really devalue anything as it's a crush focused set, especially given the fact people voted no on removing the negative stab/slash bonus (which I agree with. I'm actually happy the set effect passed because I think set effects in osrs are a cool concept just like void and barrows. Nice to see it being added more and perhaps more in the future!

That being said, someone knows the email address I use to login to Runescape, which isn't surprising since I use it for virtually everything (bad, I know) and they're using it to attempt to recover my account several times per day.

All that happens is I get the email and that's it. The relevant support article says to secure my computer (done) and to secure my account (done), and beyond that, the only thing left to do is ignore the email, since I can't actually change the login email. They're annoying as shit, though! It's every couple of hours, and I can't mute the sender because what if I really need to recover my account? Or what if I want to read an unrelated email from Jagex? I just have to keep deleting the damned things?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Is there any way Jagex can figure out a pattern of where these requests are coming from and just block them from here on out? I'll DM my RSN to a jmod if requested.

-permanant boost of +1 when equipped

it gives some skill capes more worth, and also encourages people to train further past 99 since the bonuses are appliciable only after 99.

fnu72n,distractmybrain,BEWARE: New scam I've never seen before just cost me nearly 30m,"I just got scammed nearly 30m, which was most of my net worth, and it's in a way I've never heard of before.

Basically, the scammer has two accounts. On the first account he will ask you if you want to earn 100m, and with the second, you will receive a pm warning you that the first account is scamming, but you can anti scam him by only playing one out of the two rounds.

On the first round, you are taken to an isolated place, and given 4 different kinds of feathers, 4 different kinds of teles, four different types of runes, all 2 of each.

Then he asks you to drop three valuable items, and while they're on the floor, trade him back those objects, for which he will pay you 10m. While you are clicking the objects to put in the trade, ou are clicking twice on each object since he initially gave you two of each. When he sees you're about to put in the teles, he quits the trade, and guess what. Yep, you click on the tele and it fucking sends you. Then you're in the middle of nowhere, with him logging out and collecting those items you dropped on his main.

I lost my bandos chest, abyssal dagger, and fury ammy.

I'm fucked, that's most if my worth, but I guess u learned my lesson. If it's too good I be true, it probably is.

Hopefully you can now avoid this scam.",34,1585005275,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnu72n/beware_new_scam_ive_never_seen_before_just_cost/,2007scape,1

fnr7w0,wealldie1day,The power and tank armour roadmap to keep OSRS interesting in the years to come,"With the inquisitor set came the potential for a new way to keep interest in the end game gear accumulation for both mains and irons alike.

# The road map for power armour

* Boss 1: something weak to stab

The next major PvM update sees the release of stab version of inquisitor (but will look different). This set will boost the accuracy and damage of stab weapons such the dragon hunter lance, the rapier, the hasta, the arclight at the cost of defence and prayer.

* Boss 2: dragon kin boss

Following the release of the stab armour is the release of a new dragon themed boss. The arnour will be highly useful for this bossing activity, boosting its value and the gp/hr of the previous activity where the armour set comes from. This dragon themed boss would feature a new dragon bane trident to finally complete the dragon bane weapon set.

* Raids 3: menaphos expansion

Raids 3 might be OSRS final raid and will complete the series for raids weapons. Raids 1 had the tbow, raids 2 had the scythe and raids 3 will have a warstaff. In conjunction with this staff, raids 3 will release the slash version of the inquisitor armour (but will look different). And see a new prayer book featuring higher level prayers unlocked through raid 3 prayer scroll drops. Should not be as OP as the rs3 prayer book, so no t95s and no soulsplit.

# The next power armour t75

Now that the crush, stab and slash offensive armours have been released. There will be an update allowing us to combine all of them together. We gain the power of having good offensive allround gear and the cost of our defence and prayer. 

# Tier 80 tank armour

New tank gear, can extend upon justiciar or be entirely different. Not that important outside god wars.

# Tier 80 power armour

GWD2 adds upgraded Bandos and Armadyl that outclass the t75 power armour. This could be an entirely new bossing activity going deeper into the higher ranks of the god wars or Nex 2.0

Bloodvelds, I guess I could see it being a task that people would do **if** there were a couple added to the cave. There's barely any and they're all spread out, its a very slow task in a multi hotspot.

Hill Giants, pirates, zombies, and black knights are all level 20 monsters that only appeal to a f2p noob. Make it so when you can only get these tasks when you're under something like 50 combat. Nobody but the loneliest antipker would want to kill the two black knights spawns right next to venenatis in multi, that just sounds awful.

Moss Giants are ok, no complaints there.

Without these changes I think that this is just gonna be another minimum effort, disappointing attempt to revive the wildy like mage arena 2.

fnqwjt,akidandadream,Fossil Rework,"Hey guys,

I know we have been hearing for a long time to hold onto our fossils because an update should come eventually but this seems to not be the case with all other things being prioritized. I think Jagex should take the time to rework what we can do with our left over fossils from Fossil Island. I am aware there is an option to turn them in for prayer xp but this content is pretty much useless as no high level accounts are taking the time to farm fossils for prayer. Alot of the people with hundreds of left over fossils are skillers who did 99 woodcutting here and dont want the prayer xp. or they are low level obby builds who used the museum to get their slayer staffs. Either release a low level boss we can kill to get more xp lamps or add an NPC we can trade these in to for smaller xp lamps focused on skills. Limiting it to prayer is just useless content for most of the players acquiring them on fossil island.

I earned about 3.5m blackjacking and earned 106m in seeds. All of it besides maybe 10 pickpockets were done with the rogue's outfit (which explains some odd numbers in the loot tab). Banked everything at the seed vault in the farming guild (east side) while doing contracts for about 100k xp an hour for a total of 77 hours or so with the ardy hard diary done. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants pvm supplies, unlimited hop seeds, herblore xp, farming xp, thieving xp of course, and a good chance at getting the pet (got the pet at 98).

fnq1in,Joec1211,PSA: Motherlode mine upper level,"It is INCREDIBLE to me that so many people don’t understand how the upper level of the Motherlode mine works. For the record - it is FAR more beneficial for multiple players to mine the same vein! 

From the wiki:

“The ore vein mechanics of the upper level are different than those on the base floor. On the base floor, each time a person mines an ore from a vein there is a 1:3 chance the vein depletes. On the upper level, the vein depletes 15–27 seconds after a person first mines an ore. This makes it beneficial for players to mine the same vein rather than depleting multiple veins at once. If someone with a higher mining level than you is mining the same ore they are more likely to get a larger amount of ore than you.”

fnpl04,GroovyJungleJuice,"Duradel, the highest level slayer master in Gielinor, could use spiced up a bit. I have a couple suggestions.","The new slayer masters are fun, offer unique rewards or more points or both, and employ interesting mechanics i.e. location based tasks. Duradel could use something like this because frankly, as the highest level slayer master in the game he is fairly underwhelming right now, considering even StNieve can give the same number of points as him. 

His task pool (and everyone else’s) has been diluted by new slayer monsters over the past year and a half, eroding the power of blocked spots on his exhaustive list of tasks. 
I have a couple of suggestions for how he could be made more niche and more interesting, whether by giving more points with a unique mechanic or giving players blocks more power by reducing the number of monsters he assigns. 

Suggestion 1: 

Duradel shares. 

If a player completes tasks in a row for Duradel, and doesn’t take tasks from other masters, they could be given double the streak rewards from Duradel (150 slayer points at 10 killstreak instead of 75, compared to kristellias 125 or Konar’s 90). Not even sure if this is possible to track with the spaghetti code tm, but it would be a cool way to make him relevant, and is balanced by the opportunity cost of not using the other, higher point masters and the rewards they offer. 

Suggestion 2: 

Duradel cares. 

Duradel hears your complaints about needing to skip 4 tasks to find one that doesn’t blow, he understands that when he was training there were only like 6 kinds of monsters to kill anywhere in Gielinor, and agrees that slayer has become complicated for youngsters. 
Duradel could offer reduced costs for skips after the first one, or the ability to block more tasks (again not sure about feasibility there). 

Suggestion 3: 

Duradel pares. 

If neither of the other options are possible, just pare his assignments down a bit so that players only using Duradel can block tasks more strategically than with other masters. His list as it stands has 41 monsters. It’s repetitive and has too many low level filler tasks: currently 46/293 task weightings are just metal and chromatic dragons, not including wyverns drakes or wyrms.

Good targets for deletion: trolls, spirituals (kristelia task), 2-3 of the metal and chromatic dragons, zygomites and maybe greater or black demons.",3,1584989695,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnpl04/duradel_the_highest_level_slayer_master_in/,2007scape,1

fnpbwc,August_30th,Stealing artifacts for Captain Khaled is a really underrated way of training Thieving.,"Once you have 49 Thieving and 75% Port Piscarilius favor, you can start stealing artifacts for Captain Khaled. Getting the favor is really easy - I used my Client of Kourend reward ticket on Port Piscarilius, did the Queen of Thieves quest, and then dug sandworms for 10 minutes. 

I was getting fed up with blackjacking so I decided to try stealing artifacts. While walking to most of the destinations (I'm lazy and don't have full Graceful), I was getting 60k exp an hour, but according to the wiki page, you can get 80k exp/hour at level 49. Another cool thing is you don't have to give yourself carpal tunnel trying to raise Thieving.

I think this is a really fun minigame and it's simultaneously more interactive and more afk than blackjacking. Thieving is mostly just right-clicking people, but this is something that is actually relevant to the theme while giving you competitive exp rates. I hope more skills are given this treatment.

You really just have to learn the two escape routes (north and southeast) and you can pretty much do any house. It's really, really easy.

fnozgs,GroovyJungleJuice,"[Suggestion] Duradel, the highest level slayer master in Glienor, could really use a rework, or a “spicing up”, and I have a couple suggestions.","The new slayer masters are fun, offer unique rewards or more points or both, and employ interesting mechanics i.e. location based tasks. Duradel could use something like this because frankly, as the highest level slayer master in the game he is fairly underwhelming right now, considering even StNieve can give the same number of points as him. 

His task pool (and everyone else’s) has been diluted by new slayer monsters over the past year and a half, eroding the power of blocked spots on his exhaustive list of tasks. 
I have a couple of suggestions for how he could be made more niche and more interesting, whether by giving more points with a unique mechanic or giving players blocks more power by reducing the number of monsters he assigns. 

Suggestion 1: 

Duradel shares. 

If a player completes tasks in a row for Duradel, and doesn’t take tasks from other masters, they could be given double the streak rewards from Duradel (150 slayer points at 10 killstreak instead of 75, compared to kristellias 125 or Konar’s 90). Not even sure if this is possible to track with the spaghetti code tm, but it would be a cool way to make him relevant, and is balanced by the opportunity cost of not using the other, higher point masters and the rewards they offer. 

Suggestion 2: 

Duradel cares. 

Duradel hears your complaints about needing to skip 4 tasks to find one that doesn’t blow, he understands that when he was training there were only like 6 kinds of monsters to kill anywhere in Glienor, and agrees that slayer has become complicated for youngsters. 
Duradel could offer reduced costs for skips after the first one, or the ability to block more tasks (again not sure about feasibility there). 

Suggestion 3: 

Duradel pares. 

If neither of the other options are possible, just pare his assignments down a bit so that players only using Duradel can block tasks more strategically than with other masters. His list as it stands has 41 monsters. It’s repetitive and has too many low level filler tasks: currently 46/293 task weightings are just metal and chromatic dragons, not including wyverns drakes or wyrms.

Good targets for deletion: trolls, spirituals (kristelia task), 2-3 of the metal and chromatic dragons, zygomites and maybe greater or black demons.",0,1584987784,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnozgs/suggestion_duradel_the_highest_level_slayer/,2007scape,1

I just saw a post where someone made an account for their 5 year old. I think, in an attempt to protect children under 13 that do happen to play the game, there should be a ""parent"" account, which creates an account with permanently disabled public chat. Obviously the parent would be able to re-enable public chat, but the idea is mostly for the safety of children. This would increase the number of players in the game, as it also provides a safe way of purchasing membership for your children, without worrying about not being able to cancel.

fnldqs,WIMM0,WILDERNESS DEAD F2P ABANDONED / NEGLECTED,"This might be an unpopular post but who cares.

Wilderness is dead, 308 is dead 7 days a week the lack of care on behalf of Jagex in making sure the fundamental base of pking is tended to is an actual joke. The sad thing is they have never cared for the free to play pure clans/teams in wilderness keeping it alive. The Magers that used to roam with fire strike gone, no cc unless 150 total level doesn't help this. I feel like the staff that Jagex hire have never ever been interested in anything to do with the f2p clan scene, I'd be suprised if half of them had even heard of it or knew what it was but yet it's the thing that kept both the F2P and P2P multi-zone pulse pumping, because those F2P players tend to P2P after a while but now there is no new F2P pkers P2P multi-zones have no fuel for the fire. At it's current state both scenes will dry out soon.  


Here are some videos of the clan wars and community that is no longer here because of the lack of care or any acknowledgment of existence.

Im not going to sit here and be like oh do this it will only take you guys 5 minutes! No. I understand it would probably be a big undertaking on behalf of the oldschool team, but i feel like speaking on behalf of a vast majority of the community we would be quite happy to go without any major game updates for a few weeks if it meant we got a league or a dmm season instead in the mean time. Maybe they could poll this? Maybe they could just suprise us and bring 1 out? Either way it would not only give the community something to do it would encourage the self isolation most governments are putting in place.  


A few things i would also like to add, This sort of season or w/e would be introduced doesnt need to have any monetary prizes, they dont need some fashionscape at the end etc. Just give us something to do during these tough times.  


Wether anything is implemented or not i'd like to thank the oldschool team for doing what they can to keep the game we love online and prospering through all this craziness going on in the world right now.

fnk5fq,The_Co,"[Question] [Customer Support] Need some account help, give up on CS website.","So, I've spent about an hour on the CS website today and I give up (at least I technically got paid for it, hey hey!)

I have been changing the passwords on my accounts as I usually do, and decided to do all four at once. Bad idea. When I got to the third one, and I tried to reset the PW it locked the account. To be clear, this is MY account, I haven't had any clues that it's been locked or anything. As a matter of fact, I think I changed the password like last week (and promptly forgot it).

&amp;#x200B;

I get this on the password reset screen: 

"" 

You have been temporarily blocked from using this service.

We have reason to believe that there may have  been a fraudulent appeal attempt made from this IP address. Only attempt  to appeal accounts that you personally own.""

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so, couple of things here, I do own the account... it's never been compromised. I didn't appeal anything... unless you mean the appeal to change the password?

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried reaching out to Ash on Twitter as I've seen work for some people but I'm kinda at wit's end here. Don't know what to do to get back my account. This is 100% the automated system screwing with me and, since they make it impossible to talk to a person, a 30 second fix has taken me an hour.

fnjgxi,Oh_well_sure,Evil Tree Event for OSRS,"[https://imgur.com/a/PyZeeD6](https://imgur.com/a/PyZeeD6)

Good day everyone

I would like to take a minute to discuss with the community on here wheter there is any interest in seeing the Evil Tree events come to OSRS, I am aware it was an event only added in 2009, so technically not an orignal 2007scape piece of content. The game however as it is now is has changed so much already from what it originally was.   


Why would this be an interesting addition to OSRS ? I feel the woodcutting skill as it is in OSRS serves next to no real purpose,  and there is very little profit to gain with woodcutting, most logs are better off being dropped than to even bother being banked, yew logs are worth less (less even than teak logs as it is) than they ever were worth in the original version of the game for example.   


While this event wouldnt be a direct fix to the poor condition woodcutting is in right now, it would offer a fun and above all as I remember a social opportunity to use your woodcutting level, the profits made dont have to be extraordinary, but atleast there  would be some incencitive to get your woodcutting level up to acces  new tiers of evil trees, and we could have an evil redwood tree to replace the evil elder tree tier the original game had.  


I shall include an image of the event to refresh those that have a hard time remembering this event and a wiki link for the rs3 event so that you may read about the details of this said event.

fniy4d,Krtxoe,*Wilderness Duel Arena (BH Replacement)*,"&amp;#x200B;

**Basically Bounty Hunter** but 1v1 fights to the death and rewards are mainly useful for PVPers. No need to lure PvMers into it for rune pouches or something. It's a serious PvP minigame where both players are in it for PvP items and glory.

**Start**  
You go to an underground arena in the wilderness. You have a place to bank(safe) and you can enter the waiting room from there. In the waiting room, you can be matched randomly with  anyone near your combat level (+/-10). 

**The Duel**  
Both players are **skulled and cannot teleport**. The match doesn't end until one player dies. Cannot interact at all with other players, besides your opponent.  
Protect item is allowed but can be smited. Aside from that, anything goes.  
You can stay as long as you want after your kill your opponent (to pick up items, watch, etc)

**Rewards**  
Besides killing the opponent and looting their items, **extra rewards are based on wealth risked by players and combat level**.  They are dropped on the loot pile. Basically, if players are not  risking much (ex bots) they cannot get good rewards. More emphasis on wealth risk and less about combat level.

**Possible Reward List**:  
BH Emblems  
Lockboxes  
PvP-Only equipment 

**Lockboxes**

There would be many different types and levels of lockboxes, each with a different  average value. They contain items related to PVP. Lockboxes often contain supply crates, which can be opened for runes, herbs, raw food, and more.

For example, Saradomin Brew Supply Crate. It contains everything needed to make brews, but **not actual brews**.   So, the supplies could be sold to someone with the skill needed to make them. There could be different levels ( with different amounts), or a  version for all the common potions used in PvP, like antifire,  combat,  prayer, ranging, etc.

**Zuriel, Statius and Morrigan**  
There's also a chance to obtain unique **PvP only** equipment. Basically, a PVP only version of the ancient warrior's equipment.

Mediocre armour and weapons, but if you use the full set, you get some kind of special effect **only** when fighting players. Zuriel, for example, could gain special enhancements to ancients, and maybe even some range def. **They would not be degradable.** **They would not be tradeable, but break like void and award the killer a very large amount of coins and can be repaired for 1.25x the amount of coins dropped. They can be further protected with Perdu at a very high cost plus a trouver parchment.**

It's time to bring in **structured PVP** into the game, with its own reward and semi-self sustainability

**Why?**

Bounty hunter really didn't cut it. It's a bunch of people rushing each other and praying for high hits to KO. I think OSRS's PVP scene can be better than that. **Now that bounty hunter is gone we need a PvP update badly.**

This new duel arena will give all players an opportunity to do what they saw on the DMM tournaments - structured 1v1 fights.  Should you go for a  KO? Should you try to outlast your opponent? Level defence to outlast,  or stay a pure and go for KOs?

There are a  lot more options and potential strategies. Of course,  tribridding is a  thing as well. If Wilderness Duel Arena comes into  OSRS, the pvp scene will grow immensely and the number of different account types will grow.  I imagine there will be different strategies at different level brackets.

It will also make PvP a little self-reliant. Because you can get PvP supplies from these fights. You can also obtain top-tier PVP gear (rare but possible).

**Potential PvP Equipment**

Please note this is meant to be **top tier PvP-only** equipment.

**Armor:**  
Statius  
Defenses similar to dragon but with some magic defense. No str bonus.

Zuriel  
A weaker version of Ahrims, but with some range defense.

Morrigan  
Comparable to red dhide, with a little bit more melee defense.

When wearing any of the full sets, **incoming player damage** is reduced. Something between 15 - 25%.

These  armours have somewhat low defenses, even against players, so it won't be difficult to hit through. However, in PvP, damage reduction is really nice. These armors will be top tier only in PvP.

**Weapons:**

When using weapons + the corresponding armour set, an additional effect is obtained.

Zuriel  
Extra damage + enhanced ancient magic effects (like in DMM). Enhanced effects only work on players.

Statius  
Extra damage + special attack that can only be used on players

Morrigan  
Extra damage + second hitsplat that does partial damage

**About cost (if tradeable):**

This equipment will be used mainly in the **WILDERNESS**. So while it should be expensive, it can't be so rare that no one would ever pvp with them and become dead content. It is expected that this equipment will be changing hands more often than other expensive items.

While no  one can control the market, the price of these top tier pvp sets should be around 15-50m for the whole set + weapon. If you make them as rare as third age or a twisted bow, people will rarely get the chance to use it.

If not tradeable, the set should cost 15-30m to repair.",8,1584965606,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fniy4d/wilderness_duel_arena_bh_replacement/,2007scape,1

fnihqu,notgaza,Need Reddit Help!!," 

Hi guys, either a recovered account and a show of the teams customer support coming, or a jmod smackdown, either way enjoy what follows.

Last night I was doing my usual antics, volcanic mine with the boys (I can provide the name of these boys if needed for proof). Before that I had spent the most of the day in isolation, relaxing and doing some zeah runecrafting. Logged off at a reasonable time to get my daily episode of westworld in before heading off for the night.

This morning I wake up and I cant access my account. Monkas. I attempt to login to the official runescape website and I cant access the account there either, the password is incorrect (100% I have not clicked any dodgy websites nor have I changed my password). I STILL have access to my account through mobile and there is shady things going on, yet that is the ONLY way I can get to the account. I logged in with my private off (which i dont normally have) and in no clan chat (which i normally am), looks like somebody was trying to hide themselves on my account, they did not manage to get through my bank pin thankfully but they still may have access to my account. I could check my in game inbox through mobile and it showed two messages in the EARLY morning saying my email for the account had been changed (i was fast asleep at this time I assure you).

I can't change my email or my password because I can't get access to the official runescape website. I'm not sure what other details I can provide on reddit while still being safe, but this account is nearly maxed, has thousands of hours playtime and a bank value I would prefer not to lose. I can provide a lot more details to a jmod to prove my case, please upvote this so they can see!",31,1584963324,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnihqu/need_reddit_help/,2007scape,1

&amp;#x200B;

So, i read the other day someone saw a bot type its login details into the chat and the guy said he got on the account and found money on it -My first thought, too good to be true whatever-

But then today on a f2p account i decided to report a bunch of advert bots and when i did my chat log was left with 1 guy, saying what loooked like login details - No way what!-

So i go over through them in and bam, account is currently logged in -Ok maybe its legit-

&amp;#x200B;

I got to use them to log onto the website to see if i can kick it off the game an log in coz ima greedy ass and dont mind taking a bots money, website says you must connect a email -Big flags you cant get me with that- so i create a new email address and pop it in

All goes through i log into the account its a bot just finished tutorial island and went to the GE and has 35mil on it -Big sus, but i trade that away to my account anyway nice doubled my net worth-

&amp;#x200B;

Then i start thinking, clearly they wanted me to log on and see this how are they profiting off this? Way to easy to get this far, then i realize maybe becuase ive logged on they can track that back (like you do to see where your facebook accounts are logged on) I dont know if jagex gives that information out and what use it would be if they get my IP from that any ideas?

fni2qx,notgaza,Near Max account hijacked! Need Reddits help," 

Hi guys, either a recovered account and a show of the teams customer support coming, or a jmod smackdown, either way enjoy what follows.

Last night I was doing my usual antics, volcanic mine with the boys (I can provide the name of these boys if needed for proof). Before that I had spent the most of the day in isolation, relaxing and doing some zeah runecrafting. Logged off at a reasonable time to get my daily episode of westworld in before heading off for the night.

This morning I wake up and I cant access my account. Monkas. I attempt to login to the official runescape website and I cant access the account there either, the password is incorrect (100% I have not clicked any dodgy websites nor have I changed my password). I STILL have access to my account through mobile and there is shady things going on, yet that is the ONLY way I can get to the account. I logged in with my private off (which i dont normally have) and in no clan chat (which i normally am), looks like somebody was trying to hide themselves on my account, they did not manage to get through my bank pin thankfully but they still may have access to my account. I could check my in game inbox through mobile and it showed two messages in the EARLY morning saying my email for the account had been changed (i was fast asleep at this time I assure you).

I can't change my email or my password because I can't get access to the official runescape website. I'm not sure what other details I can provide on reddit while still being safe, but this account is nearly maxed, has thousands of hours playtime and a bank value I would prefer not to lose. I can provide a lot more details to a jmod to prove my case, please upvote this so they can see!",0,1584961111,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fni2qx/near_max_account_hijacked_need_reddits_help/,2007scape,1

fnhxbe,GrandOat,FUNDRAISER: Mass Plague City,"Hey guys,

I want to set up a fundraiser for the Corona Virus, and I need YOU!

I have a few ideas on how we might be able to contribute, and Jagex is a big part in all this. READ BELOW!

I was thinking the following:
On Sunday March 22 at 10AM GMT+0, we all create new accounts and buy bonds to become members.
All the bonds bought on that day, Jagex sends to food banks/research facilities/families who need the money after job loss/etc.

If you guys are interested and want to fight back against the Coronavirus pandemic, give this a good old fashioned updoot and let’s get Jagex on board!

Should Jagex not get onboard, I hope that content creators will get behind and continue the message of keeping safe, while doing a video of our mass gathering and doing plague city.

fnhx6p,D3fykul7,Alternative to GE Tax,"I propose an idea to pay a premium on an offer to extend the buy limit for that offer. 

Say you have a buy limit of 10k on something, you can pay 30% over the offered value to extend that limit to 20k per 4 hours, or half the time to 10k/2 hrs (implementation details). 

This can be compounded to extend it farther. It would allow day to day traders to continue to function as normal and also promote trade. 

My hope with this idea is to prevent the economy prices from freaking out as soon as a tax is introduced with how much gp would leave the game quickly. 

Side notes: If the offer is canceled, the premium is gone. The effect lasts as long as the offer is active, only for the current offer, no adjacent ones for same item. (These side offers would not purchase past the original 10k limit and would decrement the premium offer)

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:  
It can have a much steeper cost.   
There would be money leaving the game.  
Traders would not be affected by it unless they choose to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:  
Has more market influence per person available  
GE Price changes, you are out the money if you change the offer.  
Added GE Code complexity.

fnf854,sandpaper623,Easy Marks of Grace for Lazy People like me,"I want to tell you a story that begins in December. I was running tunes through the abyss and was getting tired of having to use stamina potions all the time to keep the grind going.

Suddenly I remembered about full Graceful. Quickly went to Canfis and quickly learned the horrible truth. This will take forever. Now I don’t have a ton of time, so I play a little here and there when I can. 

I started reading up on the wiki about Marks of Grace. Best place to have them drop is Canfis. Perfect. But I was level 51 and the Marks have a way better drop rate when you are within 20 agility levels of the course. 

As I was looking through the wiki trying to find anything that could help me grind out all the Marks I would need.

“Marks seem to spawn based on your time spent on a course. When you've reached a time threshold, the course will allow a mark to spawn on the next lap or floor transition. This is evidenced by logging out/ staying on the final obstacle of a course, starting the next lap and guaranteeing a mark spawn.” OSRS Wiki

With that I mind I went and stayed at the last rooftop and kept an eye on the time. Sure enough, having done zero runs through the course, the next lap I started, there was my beautiful prize. That sexy ass mark of grace laying on the roof waiting for me. 

So with the limited amount of time that I had I needed to wait on the rooftop course for 2600 total minutes, and that’s what I did. For the next couple months, when I got home at night, if I felt up to it, I would pop on a podcast and just relax and keep an eye on the clock. Every 10 minutes run through the course pick up my mark and finally get my full graceful.

Not sure how many people knew about the Marks like that, but helped my lazy ass finally get my full set and I can go back to Runecrafting 3 months later.


TLDR: I’m lazy and don’t have a ton of time or care about Agility XP. You can guarantee your mark drops without running the course hardly at all. 
Marks of Grace are on a 10 minute timer, it is measured by TIME SPENT ON THE COURSE. Stay on the last roof, wait 10 minutes, then make your lap around the course and you’ll find a Mark of Grace waiting for you.",24,1584944505,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnf854/easy_marks_of_grace_for_lazy_people_like_me/,2007scape,1

fndwij,Pync,Is this the service we pay $11/mo for?,"My account was flagged as part of a bot farm and I received an IP ban across all my accounts, despite never having traded or received wealth, or in any way profited from this so called ""bot farm"". Not to mention the ""bot farm"" was one person on my IP (shared accommodation) running an (I can only assume) autoclicker of sorts - I'm unsure what it was exactly.

I had traded this person some starting gold to help them out, unaware they were going to be using third-party software. **I never interacted with this player past this point, and therefore did not profit in any way from his actions.** 

None of my accounts banned broke the rules. **Ever.** Not a single mark against them, yet your flawed system (and yes, it is flawed, because we've seen streamers get banned on stream which you quickly reverted) decided to take away almost 3,000 hours I'd invested into your game - not to mention the amount of money I poured in, being a member since 2004 and an OS player since 2003.

To add insult to injury, not a single mod has taken the time to respond or to look into the issue.

Why have you banned an account that has *never* broken a rule? Is it too much to ask that you simply CHECK my account history and confirm I have never used third-party software, profited from a bot farm or *ever* broken a rule?

I now have a lifetime ban on an account I've never once broken a rule on - not even so much as use of foul anguage. I've lost an account I invested thousands of hours into, and no-one at Jagex seems to care enough to look into it.

fnd801,drgodswrath,OSRS Community Kindness,"This post is about the OSRS community and how amazing it is. 

When I first started playing a few months ago someone was walking around Lumby handing all the new players full sets of armor and wishing them luck playing. 

Just now, I had a full inventory at barrows and finally got a good chest (Dharok's platelegs), and teled before I realized that with a full invent the item is dropped. I ran back ASAP and happened to luck out that the same room was my tunnel. I made it there and the item was gone... I started smashing my keys and telling the players there what happened. One of them (Quest Llama) told me he picked them up and I should wait outside and he would give them to me (which he did). Another (indellible) messaged me and said he would give me a pair off his main ( I told him that Quest already gave me my pair). 

I always see people giving out quest items when people ask at the GE (to people really playing... not people begging), and it's really inspiring and shows how great people can be.

I have Bipolar Disorder and this great game helps me function, but it's the community that makes it amazing.

I have a near maxed (94 strength is the only non 99) 60 attack, 1 defence pure that has being growing stale. The only reason I really want to stay at 60 attack is that I have 3k Zulrah kills and it is kind of cool to have that on a pure.

However, I cannot decide on what to do. I think going 75 attack would be fun for weapon variety, but still remaining a pure. So my first question : Is it worth going from 60 attack to 75 attack on a pure?

Second, I like to go deep wildy for bridding, and seem to always get bullied by med levels... so I'm thinking maybe if you cant beat em, join em? Haha, I have really wanted a med level account regardless, but it seems like a long grind for 175 qp and all the skilling to get the staple quests done with.

fnbfvu,AlmightyOcho,*BEWARE* Facebook phishing site. Dummy me got burned.,"**TLDR: phishing website on facebook announcing RS3 came to mobile led me to believe it was legit.**

First post and I wanted to make this a quick one before anyone else sees it.

I already take responsibility for my ignorance.

I saw this sponsored post on facebook about RS3 just is now on iOS mobile and I IMMEDIATELY clicked the link and logged in without so much as thinking twice! There is a fake facebook page (one of many I'm sure) that caught my attention that RS3 came to iOS. I clicked the link, logged in, entered my password, entered my Authenticator waiting to be sent to the app store. Oddly enough it took me to the ""RS3 coming soon"" page from the official support URL. I thought for sure it was a glitch. I must have done it twice before accepting the fact that ""it's only on the Google play store"" ! How stupid of me!

I laid down for 2 hours and in that time my character was last farming at Catherby to carrying nothing in Castle Wars! I was so confused and annoyed I stripped my pc of EVERYTHING before thinking back to this page.

The fact that it was a sponsored post completely went over my head. Upon further inspection the page was created very recently and the initial POST was created on the 3rd of this month.

I lost about 600k of armor on my character. My bank pin saved the rest of my items. This has been the first time I've ever fallen for a phishing site but I swear it'll be the last time.

Lastly, I wanted to share this with other players to **strongly encourage** that you ALWAYS check URLs and links regarding this and other websites. Again, I rarely make posts and I'm very sorry that this doesn't read the way a proper post should. I do not at ALL encourage anyone to visit this site but if there are any mods or anyone interested in helping me report this page, this info is for you.

Thanks for reading.",10,1584926909,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fnbfvu/beware_facebook_phishing_site_dummy_me_got_burned/,2007scape,1

First issue. There's some latency. How bad is it? Minuscule. 

I'd say using a mouse is almost preferable. It's great for barrows, NMZ, zeah runecrafting, stuff that is a bit more click intensive. Theres probably other things I'm missing that I have not tried.

For 20$ and a free app. I cant complain.

fn5g6i,Miintpwnage,There should be instanced GWD rooms for the bosses,"Hear me out, before I say anything, yea this is coming from an Iron mans POV. Lets get to it, so the last week, every single day, I've went through the entire members worlds list, and I can't find an open bandos room. That shouldn't be a thing, where I have to wait till 3-4 in the morning my time to maybe find a room, like I'm only there for 1-3 kill trips at most but I'd rather not wait X amount of time for a group to finish with the possibility of another group then coming to the world and waiting with me, making it pointless for me to wait.

&amp;#x200B;

This can't just be a problem for iron men, even you see main account groups just waiting outside the boss room. What would the harm be in letting us have an option to instance the rooms? just pop some npc somewhere in the GWD, preferably outside before you go down the ladder where you can pay a pretty penny to get your lost items back like vorkath/zulrah/hespori/Gargoyle bosses etc.

fn54gd,Rubber-duckling,Can we just poll Dungeoneering?,"Hey guys,  


I kinda wanted to go in depth on how Dungeoneering would fit in oldschool.  
This is a bit tomuch for me but i would love to see it in osrs.

Dungeoneering was a really fun skill you would train in groups of people and it happened to be the exact thing we need in oldschool.  
since group iron man and clans are coming to osrs soon i think its a good idea to get a system in place that will help groups together and i believe Dungeoneering is one of the best ways.  


Here a couple reasons why i believe we should atleast consider it.

1:Since they found a backup from 2012 they should have most stuff they need for the Dungeoneering skill and since they made the gauntlet we know things like hidden maps and such can be done within the boundaries of the engine.

2:Mod trick (one of the OG dung developers) according to an earlier discussion on discord said most engine features used should be in the Osrs engine already since the development on Dungeoneering started 2008.

3:Most animations used in Dungeoneering where borrowed from other stuff in the game, this means that there shouldn't have to be to much animation work needed.

4:According to Mod Ed music tracks and allot of other stuff can be ripped from the 2012 backup.  


the only downside are.  
New bosses have to be made which take allot of time.  
New rewards have to be made but i don't think this should be an issue since there is allot of stuff which we don't have in osrs yet from dungeoneering.

First, I just joined the 2007scape Reddit and want to say hey all! (If this post isn't allowed in this section, please remove!). It is a pleasure to join the community!

The Primordial Pit Welcomes all newcomers!

\*\*In Game CC: Primordial M

The Primordial Pit Clan is a new clan, digging its way deep into the Pits of Gielinor.  
Requirements to join... Dont be an arse :P...Seriously though, we are looking for all LVL ranges, from new comers to the veterans of osrs, we accept all.  
Our main requirement is that you bring in a positive attitude to the Clan Chat.  
Myself and the Primordial Guardians strive to maintain a fun and comfortable environment for all of our members.  
Our clan chat 'The Pit' has a variety of individuals with different OSRS experience, which creates an amazing environment for those who wish to ask any questions about the game, likewise for those who wish to share their experiences and help the newer player base learn.

We will be hosting both PvM and PvP events. Our Discord will be updated regularly with dates/times for such events.  
Clan members are also welcome to host their own events within the CC, of course 99 parties will be a must :P.

\*\*\*Raid Learners will be taking place in the near future, most likely live for clan accessibility.\*\*\*

I will be also broadcasting streams for the clan down the road, and will include any learners/clan events/99 parties etc, that fall onto said days!

Wishing you all a great week, and best of luck in the grind!

fn2ouy,Fambizo,MY THOUGHTS ON RS AFTER 15 YEARS,"It’s fun! I’ve always enjoyed quests, PvE and PvP. You also have mini games, of which some are kinda fun. 

But most of it is grind. Which adds to the enjoyment factor - achieving things after many hours of work. 

But this isn’t practical to most people working 9-5 jobs. It isn’t practical to people trying to achieve things in their life that involve hours of dedication. Runescape is simply another task that you’re adding to your life which takes a part of your focus, and you can’t say this is wrong. 

Taking this into a larger perspective - our meaning in life is to achieve relative success, provide, and enjoy. These are all things that require proper dedication and unless you’re there, DROP THIS GAME. I used to love playing this game under the influence of alcohol and/or cannabis. It made me realize that I just simply do not enjoy repeatedly doing the same fucking thing for hours and hours straight. You are just wasting your time broski. Get that shit outta here lmao

That being said, if you enjoy playing RS, and are not neglecting any goals or ambitions, by all means - enjoy it my brotha/sista!

But runescape isn’t a game that gratifies upon casual play, it’s a game that gratifies work, with some play at the end. 

I KNOW I’ll get a bunch of hate for this, but I don’t really care lol. This is just my opinion.

fn0zv2,mown_blue,A tool for making OSRS style maps,"I noticed that there was some demand for a tool to help make rs maps from the comments in recently popular map posts by /u/Aylavelle and /u/rururupert. A tool apparently exists but is not free. So I made a free tool, which you can check out on GitHub:

[https://github.com/andmcadams/MapHelper](https://github.com/andmcadams/MapHelper)

The tool is a plug-in for GIMP ([https://www.gimp.org](https://www.gimp.org)), which means you need to be using GIMP (vs Photoshop or Paint) to make your map. The tool is meant to be used with GIMP 2.10.

**This tool allows you to**

1. Create a new map base file, given the height/width, tile size, and background type. This generates the layers and layer groups recommended in the GentleTractor guide
2. Pixelate the map once you have smooth terrain to give it that osrs look (given tile size). This is a replacement for photoshop's ""Mosaic"" filter since GIMP's is implemented differently.
3. Add labels for landmarks, cities, and kingdoms with drop shadows. You do not need any specific fonts installed for this.

This tool is heavily based on /u/GentleTractor's guide ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GentleTractor/comments/4ziq7v/howto\_guide\_resources\_for\_making\_fake\_old\_school/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GentleTractor/comments/4ziq7v/howto_guide_resources_for_making_fake_old_school/)) for making maps, and is meant to be used alongside it. A huge thanks to GentleTractor since I wouldn't have known where to start without this guide. A copy of GentleTractor's spritesheet containing minimap icons and sprites is included in xcf (native GIMP) format for convenience until I add an updated version.

If you encounter any bugs or issues, or want to suggest features or changes, please let me know here or open an issue on GitHub. I hope that this tool is helpful for anyone wanting to create their own maps.",0,1584888649,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fn0zv2/a_tool_for_making_osrs_style_maps/,2007scape,1

fmzgwz,Pync,My accounts were erroneously identified as a gold farm and I received an IP ban.,"I've played Runescape since 2003, with a Scythe and 15 year veteran cape on my RS3 acc that I no longer play to prove it.

In almost two decades I have *never* broken a rule. All my accounts previously had zero marks against them.

Here's where the fuck up starts: I ran third party software on a low-level throwaway account, out of pure curiosity that stemmed from decades of seeing other players do it. **I know this was stupid.** I traded over some starting items, **but I never traded anything back. The goal here was mainly curiosity, and not profit** \- as I have a fairly wealthy account with 3000+ hours invested that I wouldn't dream of risking.

Did I make a stupid mistake? I sure did!

Did I knowingly break the game rules? Yep!

Did I deserve the permanent ban on the 'throwaway' bot account I made to see what all the fuss was about? **Absolutely.**

However, I feel like **permanently** banning my main account, which broke no rules and in which I invested 3,000 hours of gameplay, who **did not benefit a single GP at all** from my 'stupid experiment' may have been a bit extreme.

I understand the reasoning behind permanent bans - they're there to dissuade people from botting. And believe me, they've done the job.

I would just like to ask for my main account, **IGN Gamberro**, to be taken a quick look at. I have never committed any previous offences on it, nor have I **benefited** from botting and the only third-party clients I've ever used have been OSBuddy and Runelite, and I'm sure a cursory glance would easily prove all of this.

I implore a JMod to take the time to review my account. I live in Spain, which is under a complete state of lockdown and I'm not allowed (by law) to leave my house unless in emergencies. Attempting to log in today and finding my account banned - which has never involved in rule breaking was a huge blow.

A good friend of mine theorised that perhaps I was flagged as gold farm and therefore received an IP ban.

fmzcht,Pync,All my accounts were (erroneously) identified as a gold farm and banned without appeal.,"I've played Runescape since 2003, with a Scythe and 15 year veteran cape on my RS3 acc that I no longer play to prove it.  


In almost two decades I have *never* broken a rule. All my accounts previously had zero marks against them.  


Here's where the fuck up starts: I ran third party software on a low-level throwaway account, out of pure curiosity that stemmed from decades of seeing other players do it. **I know this was stupid.** I traded over some starting items, **but I never traded anything back. The goal here was mainly curiosity, and not profit** \- as I have a fairly wealthy account with 3000+ hours invested that I wouldn't dream of risking.

Did I make a stupid mistake? I sure did! 

Did I knowingly break the game rules? Yep!

Did I deserve the permanent ban on the 'throwaway' bot account I made to see what all the fuss was about? **Absolutely.**   


However, I feel like **permanently** banning my main account, which broke no rules and in which I invested 3,000 hours of gameplay, who **did not benefit a single GP at all** from my 'stupid experiment' may have been a bit extreme.

fmyjuq,FourTokePass,Best afk way to train magic?,"Hi guys,

So I recently hit 75/75 ATT/DEF and 85 STR at nightmare zone across maybe 2 weeks. I am now planning on getting my magic level from 55 to 80 but my current plan of alching on slayer tasks is going to be only some xp on the side,  not an efficient method.

Can anybody suggest a nice afk method to train magic, I'm not too bothered about the xp per hour, 30 to 40k/h would do me, my only requirement is it being AFK. I need to only click every 2-3 minutes at most.

Is there any methods out there? If not anything as close as possible would be amazing!

Thank you.",16,1584876803,https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/fmyjuq/best_afk_way_to_train_magic/,2007scape,1
