fsnki2,AnIgnorantSkeptic,Musings on the Epic of Gilgamesh,"# Historical Context

Imagine being suddenly transported back in time 10 centuries. The good news is any person you encounter is likely to be a relative. You have approximately 1 billion great grandparents walking around in the year 1000 CE, which is all the more amazing since there were only about 300 million people on the planet. (Translation: you are the product of copious amounts of incest.) Of course, you’d want to chat with these grandparents. After some initial convincing (no doubt involving a quick explanation of exponential growth), I’m sure they’d want to chat with you too: pinch your cheeks, feed you, and complain about great-aunt Ælthelfreda.

Unfortunately, you can’t. Sometime before your explanation reaches the definition of the slope of a tangent line, you’ll notice the bemused look on great^(x) grandpa’s face and realize that he has no idea what you are saying. Even if you happen to be in the small part of the world where Old English is spoken around the year 1,000 CE, that language is mutually unintelligible with the language you are currently reading.

Now go back another 10 centuries (try not to think about all of your great^(xx) grandparents copulating with their cousins). You’re sometime around the year 1 AD, although nobody calls it that (even if you could understand their language). If you’re located somewhere in the Roman Empire, your nearest grandparent might call it year 754, as in “754 years from the founding of the city”. Actually, Rome might be a good place to be since the “Pax Romana” just started and it looks like your chances of being stabbed to death or raped by an enemy soldier are relatively low. Ovid’s summing up the history of the world nicely in his “Metamorphoses” and some Jewish hippie is being born in the Middle East. Incidentally, for the first time in our leisurely jaunt backwards through history, a particular city in Mesopotamia actually has a population. This city, Uruk, is old and much diminished under the Parthian empire. In a few hundred years, it will be totally abandoned. Luckily, we’re not going in that direction.

For a third time, let’s skip back 10 centuries. Romulus and Remus, mythological as they are, have not yet been suckled. There is probably a Mycenean military outpost where Athens will be and Homer, legendary or not, had not yet sung of Achilles or Odysseus. David, of giant-slaying fame, is becoming king of Israel. In Mesopotamia, the power structure is shifting, not for the first or last time. Babylonia is waning and its age-old rival in the north, Assyria, is poised to reclaim its hegemony. This will be called the ‘Neo’-Assyrian Empire to distinguish it from its two older incarnations. Uruk, at this time, is in much better shape than last (next?) we saw (will see?) it. In fact, the Neo-Assyrians are going to make Uruk a provincial capital in their empire. It is around this time, according to the most conservative estimates, that a scholar named Sîn-lēqi-unninni recompiled and updated a narrative about an ancient hero (uh…I mean ancient even for Sîn-lēqi-unninni). That hero happens to have been the king of Uruk: Gilgamesh.

We’d have to hop back in our Delorean (actually, like, twice more!) if we wanted to go all the way back to the actual, historical king Gilgamesh on whom these stories were based, but if you’re like me all this time travel stuff is starting to make you a little dizzy. So let’s rest in Sîn-lēqi-unninni’s time. We’ve travelled 3000 years back to find the first complete “Epic of Gilgamesh”. Actually, almost everything in that last sentence is wrong. It wasn’t the first. It’s still not complete. And it’s not really an “Epic”. Believe it or not, this is all part of the fun of reading it. If all of this seems like a long, arduous journey to a book discussion, that’s because it is. Form follows function. Gilgamesh took an impossibly long, arduous journey to get to us. And if half the stories about his legendary virility are true, he is almost certainly your great^(xxx) grandpa. So, really, you can look at this as a kind of “Big Fish”-style family history.

OK, OK, you get the point: this story is very old. But part of the challenge of wrapping your head around it is that it also relatively young. You see, the Gilgamesh’s story should not only be defined by all that came after it, but also by all that came before. While it’s hard to find a description of Gilgamesh that doesn’t include the word “oldest”, it’s really the culmination of a two-thousand-year literary tradition. First and foremost, there were the separate tales that were combined into the original “Old Babylonian” story (i.e. the one Sîn-lēqi-unninni was updating). These were about Gilgamesh’s many adventures, but he is only one character in a complex mythology of gods and kings.[ There were some 3,000 (!) named deities in cuneiform texts.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mesopotamian_deities) There were also[ several creation myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_creation_myth), lots of religious hymns and royal praise poems, and even (my personal favorite) an[ enchanted war hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharur_(mythological_weapon)) that could talk and fly! Gilgamesh is only the most famous character in a rich mythological and literary landscape.

But that’s not the only reason the story can be considered “young”. It was also only recently discovered and translated. Gilgamesh may be much older than Achilles, but the latter has been analyzed by 150 generations of scholars, whereas Gilgamesh has been read by only about 8 since being rediscovered. Additionally, it’s still incomplete in more ways than one: only about 2/3 of it has been recovered from the original cuneiform and there are an increasing number of new editions, translations, and retellings. Somehow, the “oldest” story in the world continues to be molded today.

It is with all of this in mind that we can finally attempt to approach Gilgamesh on its own contradictory terms: impossibly old but young, simultaneously historical and legendary, singularly famous despite being just one of many, literally set in stone yet still mutable.

# The Story Itself

Gilgamesh is essentially a coming-of-age story. It begins with Gilgamesh as an impetuous youth who then grows into a devil-may-care-adventurer before finally maturing into a wise king. This character arc is impressive when contrasted with other ancient heroes. Achilles begins the Iliad as a great warrior who is angry and doomed and ends it as a great warrior who is angry and doomed. Odysseus encounters many trials in his quest to return home, but he arrives there with all the cunning determination with which he set out. Gilgamesh, for all his demi-godliness, is more relatable than that. He suffers great loss, but that does not define him. He sets out on a daring task and he fails. However, he still improves. And the mechanism by which he improves, learning to accept the inevitability of death, is something we can all do. We cannot slay Hector or outsmart the Cyclops, but we can learn to make the most of our short lives. I don’t know if Gilgamesh was written for royalty or peasantry (more on that later). What I do know is that either audience, or even an ignoramus on a distant continent 4,000 years in the future, could benefit from the lesson.

There are many other themes explored in the story: origin stories for natural phenomena, humility before the gods, and the proper duties of a king. One I find particularly interesting is the conflict between wild nature and civilized society. The wild-man Enkidu is civilized through (ahem…prolonged) sexual intercourse with a temple harlot. Aside from the obvious question for less divine lovers in the audience (HOW?!?!) there is a the more cerebral question of why? Why does having sex with a temple harlot civilize Enkidu? Is there some power from her religious office or would having relations with any woman have the same effect? Is there something “civilized” about the act itself (animals have sex too, yanno) or is it because he was allowed to have sex with a human (as opposed to a gazelle) that did it? Whatever the reason, once one is indoctrinated into the cult of civilization, the benefits are clear. Enkidu tastes bread and beer for the first time, and he doesn’t seem too sore about not being able to graze with his wild beasts anymore (another marathon love-making session might have had something to do with that too…though it must have made him sore in other ways...)

# Reverberations

Despite these internal curiosities, the most intriguing questions about Gilgamesh are meta. For one, who was the audience? Were they courtiers in Gilgamesh’s palace reverently listening to the great deeds of their lord? Or were these bawdy campfire tales with peasants guffawing at the Enkidu’s preternatural penis? Did soldiers tell the stories on long marches to kill time or did parents lull their children to sleep with the tales after long days of toil?

The so-called “experts” are not sure if the story was definitive or adapted in each telling. Perhaps fittingly, in trying to figure out if the Epic was extemporaneously riffed on like Homer’s Epics, we are riffing on it ourselves. In the end, it doesn’t matter what the Gilgamesh story “really was” like back then, because it is still being updated today. Like a 4,000 year old version of[ The Aristocrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats), it’s never really finished.

I can’t help but wonder what an ancient Sumerian would think if he could be transported to a modern reading the story. Would he collapse in riotous laughter at the absurdity of how wrongly we translated it? Or would he stare in polite bemusement[ like the Dalai Lama did when that Australian dude told him the pizza joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeyuIdmA0YE)?

Can we be naïve enough to believe that he would recognize it at all? If I ever become a billionaire, I’d like to hire a team of philologists, linguists, and cryptologists (and maybe one stoner from the “ancient aliens” demographic, just for fun) who are unfamiliar with Gilgamesh. I will lock them all in a room with the[ Behistun Inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription) and all of the discovered Gilgamesh tablets and see if they come up with anything like our modern translations. To add to the fun, next door I will lock a team of the world’s most brilliant Assyriologists (in a high enough number for them all to feel a bit of peer pressure) and give them a “newly discovered” Gilgamesh tablet with a randomly generated combination of words from all other discovered tablets. Wouldn’t it be fun if they came out with a coherent story?

Reading Gilgamesh is like petting Schrödinger's cat. All of the various possibilities of the story exist simultaneously. You are in the quasi-legendary court of the historical King Gilgamesh listening to a minstrel sing of the king’s virility. You’re a scribe meticulously chiseling the friendship of Gilgamesh and Enkidu in stone two millennia later. At the same time, you’re a prince watching an actor’s portrayal of Gilgamesh slaying the “Bull of Heaven” before a ceremonial feast. Now you’re cowering behind your father’s legs as he points out the bull’s shape in the night’s sky. You’re a philosopher arguing the merits of Gilgamesh’s mundane wisdom. You’re a 19th century explorer digging up an ancient flood buried in sand. You’re a scholar in a musty museum basement deciphering a spurned goddess’ diatribe. You’re a 21st century reader mourning the brevity of Enkidu’s life-and your own.

For some, the gaps in the current narrative may be frustrating. For me, they enhance the story. Like a homing beacon to humanity transmitting a faint but steady signal from beneath the desert of Iraq, Gilgamesh has always been trying to reach us. Through an unbroken genetic chain and reverberating echoes in biblical stories, he has been calling to us. The discovery of the stone tablets has only boosted his signal. I like to think of the ellipses (…) in the translations as static noise in the radio transmission and the uncertain lines \[bracketed, in George’s translation\] as warped sounds as we turn the tuner left and then right to try to pick up the signal of the important message from our god-like ancestor:

remember….

……………….GILGAMESH….

……\[loved\], LEARNED, and lost

………………………………………..\[who did great things\]

……..Remember……..

…..friend…..

………………………………………………………..gods…………….

\[BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE\]…

Remember…

Remember.

fsndkm,innerknightmare,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a boring, lifeless book.","400 pages of pure horseshit, five days of reading wasted down the drain. The writing is full of highfalutin words and it gets boring pretty quickly. I don't know what lunatic coined this a thriller, but I had to force myself through the pages, in hopes that something would happen. But it didn't, the first 200 pages keep rambling about the perils of motherhood and how much Eva loathes being a mother. 200 pages just for that. Another 100 for introducing the family and the last 100 describing the events preceding the dreaded shooting. 

Besides being boring, the book doesn't teach or take a stance on anything, letting the reader do all the thinking. There is no plot and I've spent more time sifting through a dictionary instead of pondering the underlying causes of Kevin's degeneracy - The book simply doesn't connect with the reader on any level. The book itself is frustrating to read as you expect some sort of clash, action or resistance from the parents, but it just never happens. Nothing ever happens in this book.

There was a small twist which surprised me near the ending, which prompted me to give this book two stars instead of one.

2/5 overall.

fsmwv8,DukEucalyptus,Pynchon and Dense Writers in Quarantine Times,"The general readership is always so intimidated by Gravity’s rainbow, but it has taken me nearly an entire decade of stopping and starting Against the Day to get even up to the end of Part One. Somehow GR felt more propulsive whereas Against the Day is non stop sensory overload The thing is like a quadruple album that has a 10 minute first track that represents everything you love about music, which you listen to repeat so much you forget the rest of the album exists. 

Crying of Lot 49, GR and Inherent Vice have more digital ink, podcasts and lit magazines written about them whereas Against the Day,  Vineland and Bleeding Edge totally get slept on.

Pynchon feels like the perfect author for quarantine times but he is also so demanding and even dispiriting with how much focus and attention his books demand. Readers tend to think they are just too stupid for Pynchon, but they are wrong! Pynchon’s Brain barely feels human to me. His books read like the musings of a super computer that likes shoehorning ironic Looney Tunes  antics in and around some of the most profound musings of universal human struggles and existence ever put to page.

I’m a casual reader and don’t really know much about taking care of books (except the basic, such as keeping them dry and out of sunlight) so my question for all of you is if you know what this marks are and how to prevent them?.

Also, should I take my comicbook collection out of the same shelf or does this marks not spread to other books?

fsek0s,Alberts_Hat,Non-death related true crime,"Going on television now, it feels like the number of stories that can fit under the 'true crime' umbrella has grown. *Tiger King* is the most obvious example at the moment, but we've also gotten several stories about Richard Jewell, the man who's life was pretty much ruined because they thought he was the one who planted the bomb in Atlanta. There are also the various documentaries about the Fyre Festival, an act of massive fraud that hurt a lot of people.

This got me thinking, why don't we seem to see this more often in books? I know of two true crime books that don't involve killings, and those are *The Wolf of Wall Street* by Jordan Belfort and *American Fire* by Monica Hesse, the latter of which is a great story about a year long arson spree in one of the poorest counties in Virginia.

And I think this is a good thing. For one, there is less lionization of murderers and ignoring the deaths of innocent people. Also, these stories seem to bring more attention to the victims than the perpetrators. *American Fire* isn't about the ones responsible for the fire, but more so how it affects the community that they are taking advantage of.

fscv13,FakeCraig,"“A Carpet Ride to Khiva”, a hidden gem set in oft-forgotten Uzbekistan. I never thought a book about carpets would make me feel so much love!","After deeply enjoying a re-read of one of my teenage favourites, *Idriss, la noia del fil de seda* by Hermínia Mas (Catalan only), I decided to look for another book about Uzbekistan, eventually coming across this one.

Set in a carpet workshop, the author of “A Carpet Ride to Khiva” tells us about his seven years living in the country, exploring not only numerous carpet design and weaving techniques, but also culture shock, old traditions, cotton picking, history and corruption. I feel like I learnt a lot.

The love he has for Uzbekistan shines through and as soon as I find myself thinking ""what else is there to say about carpets?"", he comes up with something new. There’s something interesting found in every chapter. The moment he excitedly talks about hidden carpets painted in old miniatures, I also felt that excitement and I took out my phone to search for the same paintings, trying to get a real image of the wonder he was describing. By the end of the book, I had come to see Khiva as my ""home"" as well, and I turned the last page with a bittersweet feeling knowing that it was the end. For that reason, I'm now going to read my third Uzbek book of the year, *The Dancer from Khiva* by Bibish.

(Don’t confuse this book with “A Ride to Khiva”, that is an earlier book written by an arrogant English military man and his travels around the country in 1875.)

fsco5b,MindfulRain,Can't get into Gaiman.,"I've tried. I've honestly tried. When it comes to authors, I have a three-strike rule. If I don't like the first book that I read from any given author then I will read two more to give them a second (and third) chance. I've attempted to read three books by Gaiman with pretty high hopes going into it (based on the hype surrounding him) only to find my hopes tossed from precipice and shattered on the rocks of reality far below. I don't know what it is about his style, but it just...misses with me. 

I first started reading American Gods a few years back and ended up putting it down about half-way. I couldn't make it through a quarter of Good Omens and was honestly annoyed by the second chapter (I liked the show, however), and Norse Mythology was the better of the three and the only one of which I was able to tolerate enough to make it completely through. But I don't even know if counting that last one is fair because, while he did rewrite the legends of the Norse gods, it was based off of the already thorough writings in the Poetic and Prose Eddas. His regurgitation of them didn't require too much thought or creativity.

Don't get me wrong. This isn't a dig at him as a person. From all I've heard, he seems like a really nice guy. But his writing style falls flat on its face.

His character development is bland, his world-building leaves much to be desired, the narration is dry and often repetitive, and much of the dialogue is predictable and stereotypical. 

And maybe it's just his modern style...I don't know. I come from a Brit Lit background, so maybe that's the issue. But then again, I love Anne Rice, Stephen King, Joe Hill (most of the time), and many other modern authors. Even Louis L'amour is more tolerable, and I utterly despise Westerns!

Looking at William Golding’s life in the war and as a schoolboy teacher, his loss of faith and his realisation of humanities most animalistic side, this book was so much more than I expected at face value. There was so much beautiful symbolism in this book ! The biblical imagery alongside the concept of a false idol was such a complex and interesting juxtaposition. The masterful observation of how humans act and behave was very on point. 

However there was a moment in the book where one of the boys uses the n-word. In all seriousness is this okay ? Sure Golding was a product of his time in this sense but it doesn’t take away from the slur that it always has been. Today, should white authors use the n-word in light of accurately recreating history ? it isn’t my place to say-

But in the past couple of years I have almost stopped reading all together. I want to start up again but I realize part of the issue is I have no idea what to read. 
I love fiction and right now I am enjoying the Annihilation book series. But I don’t know what I am going to read next and that concerns me. I’m worried I’m just going to stop again if I don’t have something to get excited about reading next. 
So, I love fiction, magic, science, female empowerment, non-fiction if it’s odd, adventure, funny and I especially love things that are dark and macabre. 
The Johannes Cabal, the Necromancer is my all time favorite book series, it’s dark funny, adventures with a witty cynical anti hero as the main focus. If knowing that helps with a recommendation.

fsbbzl,nullbyte420,"Has anyone read ""I burn Paris"" by polish author Bruno Jasienski? It's written in 1928 and HIGHLY relevant in these plague-times.","It's a fantastic 1928 novel by the polish futurist Bruno Jasienski about a guy who gets really mad and poisons the water supply in Paris, resulting in a serious quarantine into different sections, that each develop their own communities. Some are communist, some are american expats, the police has a little island too. Multiple characters, they meet up. As a mark of quality, it was banned in France.

I make it sound boring, but it's a literary masterpiece. Extremely poetic and well written, fantastic descriptions of 1920's Paris (and homosexual, chinese and colored people are mentioned without disdain!), great story and very deep characters. Pretty cover too. Highly recommended!

Jasienski also wrote a BRILLIANT and humorous criticism of the nazi ideology, in 1936 (""The nose"", recently published in ""The Legs of Izolda Morgan"")!

**The style of writing is quite varied depending on the character, here are some spoiler-free samples:**

&gt;""*Pierre didn't go out to look for work. He made it to Place Vendôme in the early morning and, leaning on the gate next to the warehouse, waited for Jeanette to appear. A hollow anxiety filled his body. In his heavy, sleep-starved head, vague images of the most improbable accidents rose like drifting islands of tobacco smoke in an airless room. He stayed that way all day, glued to the iron grille. \[...\] Dusk fell. The lanterns were lit and splattered colorless stains on the inky surface of the night, neither soaking into it nor illuminating it, an algae of shadows, the fantastical fauna of the bottomless depths populating the riverbed of the street.*""

There's some interesting (and published in 1928 mind you!) anti-colonial communist dreaming and a very, very impressive foreshadowing of modern day China:

&gt;""*Chow-Lin laughed: 'White people like money. You have to work for money. White people don't like to work. They like other people to work for them. Where they live, machines and their own kind, whites, do the work for them. But there's never enough money for the white people. That's why they came to China and yoked up all the Chinese to work for them. The Emperor and the Mandarins helped them. That's why Chinese people live in such poverty, because they have to work for both the Mandarins and the Emperor - and above all, for the white people, who need lots and lots fo money, and so there's nothing left for us.' So the white people had to be fought? They were invaders \[...\] But how could you fight them when thy had machines for doing everything and machines for killing? \[...\] Chow-Lin said: For the time being you can't. You have to learn from them. The Chinese nation is the most populous of all. If it knew how to do everything the white people can, it would be the mightiest nation in the world, and it wouldn't have to work for the white people. Little P'an's \[he's a child at this point\] head spun from such conversations, his pulse hammered in his temples. At night he dreamt of enormous iron cities, gigantic monstrous machines with gaping steel maws, pouring out torrents of ready-made clothing, hats, umbrellas, rickshaws, houses, streets, cities... and waking up in the middle of the night, P'an had reveries: he'd grow up, get over there -- on foot was impossible, let's say by ship -- he'd spy, track down and smuggle out the white people's secret, bring it back to China, build enormous machines everywhere, and he'd set white people at the machines, the ones who didn't like to work, and he'd force them to work day and night, so that the cowed, tired, and starved Chinese could finally rest.*""

And here, the Jewish Rabbi Eliezar ben Zvi and his parisian community is wonderfully depicted:

&gt;*""Rabbi Eliezer ben Zvi has two tiny eyes planted close together, both on the side that looks toward heaven. Once in private, the shammes told old Hershel that the rabbi often speaks with God. God and the rabbi tell each other tales for hours at a time. And the Jews know: the rabbi can speak with the Lord whenever he pleases. It's as though he has a hotline. Ordinary Jews can try calling God their whole lives and never get through, so many people want to talk to him at the same time. Sometimes, a Jew manages to contact Him once in his life, for just a brief moment, and then he has to make his request very quickly before someone else cuts in. You might say that Rabbi Eliezer has a private line at his disposal, and he can speak with God at any time of day, without being worried that someone will interrupt him. Rabbi Eliezer knows that the Lord doesn't like to be bothered when He's busy, just like any Jew, and he knows by now at what times of day he can speak with Him most freely. For this reason the Lord has a soft spot for Rebbe Eliezer, and He hasn't yet had cause to refuse him anything.""*

The whole introduction to the Jewish community is fantastic, it both depicts a community that more bothered with daily life no longer cares much about religion, and the very religious Rabbi Eliezer and his struggles with this community. The way Eliezer is described through the chapter reads like a jewish theological exposition (the position and direction of his eyes is thoroughly examined and multiple interpretations of his eyes appear through that chapter, this is just one of them), it's extremely culturally correct and just in general very impressive writing.

fs9xnr,chortlingabacus,Genre and generic: a forgotten series,"I was browsing books from Sternberg Press and came upon one that looked especially interesting. And indeed it was.:*Signature Strengths* was edited &amp; designed by Boy Vereecken and contains the texts of a series of books I'd never heard of, the No-Frills genre novellas published in the 80s. There were alas only 4 in the series, each of them with a cover inspired by packaging of generic supermarket goods, a title consisting only of genre name, and none of them credited with an author. Each was written by a different person to a brief suitable, more or less, to the genre of the book--Science Fiction e.g. was to include aliens, giant ants, space cadets, robots, and one plucky girl.


All the books are firmly within their genres--in fact I wonder whether regular readers of the genres might not realise that they're satires of them--but vary in tone. Western has a broad humour--an abusurd body count, a life save by a stale cookie, a hero whose 'shucks ma'am' vocabulary suddenly becomes at one point full of Latinate polysyllables. Mystery is only lightly satiric though the plotline is unlikely and the detective goes about finding a record producer in a ridiculously roundabout way. Romance makes that plotline look conventional, though: Perhaps with Richardson's Pamela in mind the heroine, a nursing nun, is kidnapped, almost raped, and taken overseas for a sham marriage--all with the connivance of her Mother Superior. But wait! there's more! In the end the reason behind these complications is given and ihat underlying plot is the most wonderfully and idiotically far-fetched one you could imagine. Science Fiction was my favourite of the lot as the humour was in the writing, low-key dumb rather than glaringly bad: Why use 'green' when you can say 'verdant'? Why not display creativity by comparing darkness to roofing tar?

The book is well-designed and has stock, or rather genre, illustrations and you can see the covers [here](http://www.weirduniverse.net/blog/comments/no_frills_books). I hope I've piqued someone's interest as this is a terrific find. (And btw Vereecken edited another book covering yet another little-known series, that of the Crimes Dossier stories, books containing bits of paper, hair, small objects serving as clues to the mystery's solution.",0,1585647114,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs9xnr/genre_and_generic_a_forgotten_series/,books,1

fs9a1f,Silent-Entrance,How victorians proposed," 

MY DEAR MISS B,—I have your guardian’s permission to address you on a subject than which I have none more at heart. I am not, I trust, mistaken in the recognition of some deeper correspondence than that of date in the fact that a consciousness of need in my own life had arisen contemporaneously with the possibility of my becoming acquainted with you. For in the first hour of meeting you, I had an impression of your eminent and perhaps exclusive fitness to supply that need (connected, I may say, with such activity of the affections as even the preoccupations of a work too special to be abdicated could not uninterruptedly dissimulate); and each succeeding opportunity for observation has given the impression an added depth by convincing me more emphatically of that fitness which I had preconceived, and thus evoking more decisively those affections to which I have but now referred. Our conversations have, I think, made sufficiently clear to you the tenor of my life and purposes: a tenor unsuited, I am aware, to the commoner order of minds. But I have discerned in you an elevation of thought and a capability of devotedness, which I had hitherto not conceived to be compatible either with the early bloom of youth or with those graces of sex that may be said at once to win and to confer distinction when combined, as they notably are in you, with the mental qualities above indicated. It was, I confess, beyond my hope to meet with this rare combination of elements both solid and attractive, adapted to supply aid in graver labors and to cast a charm over vacant hours; and but for the event of my introduction to you (which, let me again say, I trust not to be superficially coincident with foreshadowing needs, but providentially related thereto as stages towards the completion of a life’s plan), I should presumably have gone on to the last without any attempt to lighten my solitariness by a matrimonial union.  
    Such, my dear Miss Brooke, is the accurate statement of my feelings; and I rely on your kind indulgence in venturing now to ask you how far your own are of a nature to confirm my happy presentiment. To be accepted by you as your husband and the earthly guardian of your welfare, I should regard as the highest of providential gifts. In return I can at least offer you an affection hitherto unwasted, and the faithful consecration of a life which, however short in the sequel, has no backward pages whereon, if you choose to turn them, you will find records such as might justly cause you either bitterness or shame. I await the expression of your sentiments with an anxiety which it would be the part of wisdom (were it possible) to divert by a more arduous labor than usual. But in this order of experience I am still young, and in looking forward to an unfavorable possibility I cannot but feel that resignation to solitude will be more difficult after the temporary illumination of hope.

In any case, I shall remain,  
    Yours with sincere devotion,

fs8ict,BeautifulAche,Vera by Elizabeth von Arnim: one of the lesser-known inspirations behind Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca,"Elizabeth von Arnim (Katherine Mansfield’s cousin) was primarily known for her lighter fiction such as *The Enchanted April*. However, *Vera* takes quite a different tone. Based on Von Arnim’s disastrous  second marriage, it depicts a widower’s systematic emotional abuse of his young 2nd wife while the presence of his 1st wife Vera - whose death may or may not have been suicide - is never far away.

Although *Rebecca* has more obvious parallels with books like *Jane Eyre*, *Vera* is also said to have been an inspiration. Described by John Middleton Murry as “*Wuthering Heights* written by Jane Austen” the writing is an intriguing combination of cozy and terrifying. I actually read *Vera*/before Rebecca, and although I love both books, in many ways I found *Vera* more compelling due to its small scale and tight focus. When reading *Vera*, Browning’s poem “My Last Duchess” also comes to mind.

Has anybody else read *Vera*? I’d love to hear your thoughts on it, particularly if you’ve also read *Rebecca*! I cannot think of a better book than *Vera* as a cautionary case study of emotional abuse.",5,1585639399,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs8ict/vera_by_elizabeth_von_arnim_one_of_the/,books,1

fs7jfl,YaBoiMarcAntony,East of Eden Chapter 8 is a Masterpiece,"Now, the rest of the book is too, but chapter 8 is a special, self-contained masterpiece.

(There will be spoilers for this chapter, but none for the rest of the book. I've read the book, so go on discussing the rest of it of you'd like) 

It starts out with that strong, Steinbeck language where you can just see his classic American author face as you read it:

""I believe there are monsters born in the world to human parents. Some you can see, misshapen and horrible, with huge heads or tiny bodies; some are born with no arms, no legs, some with three arms, some with tails or mouths in odd places. They are accidents and no one's fault, as used to be thought. Once they were considered the visible punishment for concealed sins.

And just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?""

Thusly you are eased into the chapter, and he goes on to discuss a little while longer his ideas, before he finally introduces Cathy Ames. Steinbeck manages to adroitly and beautifully create this perfect picture of innocence out of a character who is a stone's throw away from pure evil.  He weaves these descriptions of her beauty and childlike innocence in the smile with her ability to manipulate people through these expertly crafted lies or stories, and you're given this impression that she is entirely *wrong*, an abberation within the novel's world; yet, she still remains childish in my eyes - but he is not done yet.

You're given this image of a little girl who everyone recognizes some oddity in, but they can't quite place it and nonetheless adore her, and you find yourself wondering how she could be a monster as Steinbeck says - and then you get to her experience with the two boys. You read how she manipulated these two innocent children into a sexual situation, and all the while she's just waiting to pull the rug from under them, and to see her pull that rug is both awful and exhilarating. She effectively ruins or at least majorly sidetracks these two boy's lives, and for what? The mere enjoyment of it? To see if she could? Steinbeck never says.

Then there is the suicide of James Grew, something that may not even be through any act of Cathy Ames, but we're fed this one sentence:

""He was never seen with Cathy and no relationship was even suspected.""

And you know from then on that everything you read of James is all on her hands. That he comes to the Ames home and talks with her father almost feels like it was apart of her machinations, like she wanted her father to feel at fault for James's suicide, even if there is no way that could be that the case.

When she runs from home and is eventually found and punished (whipped) by her father, you'll find this cold, heart-stopping paragraph:

""Mr. Ames was frightened at the noise and hurt he was creating. He stopped. Cathy dropped back on the bed, sobbing. And if he had looked, her father would have seen that there were no tears in her eyes, but rather the muscles of her neck were tight and there were lumps just under her temples where the jaw muscle knotted. ""

Cathy was always in control, her father had and has no power over her in this punishment, he is totally at the whims of Cathy, and he doesn't and will never know.

Finally, you have the bone-chilling ending, the ending which is spoonfed to you through hints before directly given.

""She cleaned the cellar and stuffed papers all around the edges of the foundation to block the draft. When the kitchen door squeaked she oiled the hinges and then the lock rust turned too hard, and while she had the oil can out she oiled the front-door hinges too. She made it her duty to keep the lamps filled and their chimneys clean. She invented a way of dipping the chimneys in a big can of kerosene she had in the basement,""

And then she can be found at her father's work,

""She was interested not only in the tanning processes but in the business end too. Her father explained the loans, the payments, the billing, and the pay. He showed her how to open the safe and was pleased that after the first try she remembered the combination. ""

You read all this and you begin to understand what it is Cathy aims to do, but your brain rejects it, believing that she couldn't be that awful, that no one could be that awful, and then you read the final page, you read her final preparations for the fire, and you are given this closing sentence before the last section:

*Cathy walked daily toward the center of the town where the bank was. And she was so fresh and pretty that people walking turned and looked after her when she had passed. ""

She does not revel in her evil, it is clear to no one but us what she has done, she has just set in motion the events which will culminate in one of the worst acts any child could ever do, and like true evil would act, she shows absolutely no signs of it. And there you have it, her parents go up in flames and suddenly you realized that you've just come face to face with one of the greatest evils ever set to literature. 

I know I am not the first to slather East of Eden with praise, nor will I be the last (much to the chagrin of you long-time r/books readers who've seen more than enough posts dedicated to the book), but I felt that this chapter deserved special recognition.",5,1585634442,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs7jfl/east_of_eden_chapter_8_is_a_masterpiece/,books,1

My favourite parts were
1) Jack going into 217 and not finding the woman but  feeling her presence 
2) The ballroom scene where Jack meets Grady
3) The wasps stinging Danny at midnight


I then decided to watch the movie, and I have to say, very good acting by Jack Nicholson. However, IMO, the movie doesn't even come close to the book

It was then I realised the true genius of Stephen King.  The way he builds up his characters(Jack's history with his violent dad, Wendy's bitch of a mom),  his understanding of abuse and trauma, and the way he spins the story to make a hard hitting impact is truly brilliant. When I watched the movie, Jack came across as an evil bastard who was excessively selfish, but when I read the book, I really felt pity for him inspite of his violent ways. 

This was my second book by King. I read Pet Sematary a year back and that too was amazing. Right now, I have IT, Salem's Lot, Cujo and 11/22/63 lying in my bookshelf .

fs6pr8,ben671176,I don’t understand how readers can read Historical “Nonfiction” books without Bibliographies.,"A big part of having a hobby in history for me is reading various books on separate parts of history. Reading History books from the 50s is vastly different from reading history books from today. The pure form of different writing styles tells you a progression or a regression in History.

Such as how I own various French Encyclopedias that worship Napoleon hardcore. (These books are like 80+ years old).

A big topic I wanted to discuss is how vastly different a lot of these Historical books which are not school textbooks or encyclopedias have strong opinionated pieces that do not provide sources and/or Bibliographies to vat sums of their works.

A huge example is the attributes and differences between these two books: “The Real George Washington” (by blank) and the book “1776” (by David McCullough). I am personally not going to provide an essay right now but a big indicator being the worths of these books is that 1776 provides a Bibliography.

“White Goddess” (by blank) is another historical account book with absolutely no Bibliography. Heavy opinionated piece.

“Guns, Germs, and Steel” (by Jared Diamond) another historical book with absolutely no Bibliography.

I am by no way belittling the few books I mentioned and I am not trying to be belligerent to the fans of these particular books. Though I personally do not understand why Readers are so infatuated by these such novels that essentially are walls of text that cannot stand up for themselves.

I should not need to own a College level textbook to be a companion book to a historical account book. In fact, it should really be the other way around. Back when I took AP U.S. History, I used “1776” as a companion novel to my textbook.

It is also very difficult for me to take facts and opinions in these such books when there is no proper context or sources. It honestly infuriates me when an author seemingly jumps to a conclusion on history when there is no proper paper trail to their own particular study.",9,1585630457,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs6pr8/i_dont_understand_how_readers_can_read_historical/,books,1

fs694x,dnrlk,What does Francine Prose have against Ray Bradbury?,"Francine Prose in her famous essay ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Cannot Read"" rather savagely denounced many (but not all, I guess?) of the typical high school curriculum:

&gt; My own two sons, now twenty-one and seventeen, have read (in public and private schools) Shakespeare, Hawthorne, and Melville. But they’ve also slogged repeatedly through the manipulative melodramas of Alice Walker and Maya Angelou, through sentimental, middlebrow favorites (To Kill a Mockingbird and A Separate Peace), the weaker novels of John Steinbeck, the fantasies of Ray Bradbury.   
&gt;  
&gt;...  
&gt;  
&gt; Maya Angelou and Harper Lee are not the only authors on the lists. The other most popular books are The Great Gatsby, The Scarlet Letter, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Catcher in the Rye. John Steinbeck (The Pearl, Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath) and Toni Morrison (Song of Solomon, Sula, The Bluest Eye, Beloved) are the writers — after Shakespeare — represented by the largest number of titles. Also widely studied are the novels of more dubious literary merit: John Knowles’s A Separate Peace, William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, Elie Wiesel’s Night, and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, Dandelion Wine, The October Country, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. Trailing behind these favorites, Orwell (Nineteen Eighty-Four and Animal Farm) is still being read, as are the Brontës (Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre). 

In another review, she writes

&gt; As a child, before I’d learned to distinguish between high and low art, between great and popular literature, one of my favorite novels was Ray Bradbury’s *Fahrenheit 451*. 

It seems that she classifies ""Shakespeare, Hawthorne, and Melville"" and maybe ""The Great Gatsby, The Scarlet Letter, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Catcher in the Rye. John Steinbeck (The Pearl, Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, The Grapes of Wrath) and Toni Morrison (Song of Solomon, Sula, The Bluest Eye, Beloved)"" as ""great literature"" though I'm not sure about the collection starting with ""The Great Gatsby"" and onward, because she only calls them ""popular"", and not ""great"" or anything. However, her transition ""also widely studied are the novels of more dubious merit"" seems to imply that she considers the first collection of books more ""meritful"".

All three quotes denounce Ray Bradbury's works; the first as books to be ""slogged through"", the second as books of ""dubious literary merit"", and the third as ""popular literature"", though the third reveals that once upon a time she did not in fact think that *Fahrenheit 451* was a ""slog"". She also seems to not like Orwell very much. 

Why might Prose consider Bradbury's (or Orwell's) classic works (works even renowned in literary circles) to be sub-par?",28,1585628361,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs694x/what_does_francine_prose_have_against_ray_bradbury/,books,1

fs5p2x,Soulfire1123,Two consecutive literature classes have sucked all the fun out of reading and it kinda sucks.,"Hi all, I'm currently a junior in college. I used to major in creative writing (technically still do but won't be graduating with it), am currently in film production. As part of the creative writing requirements, you have to take a few literature classes. Cool, right? I'm already in the book world, what's a few books a semester to read? Well, you read the title.

Last semester, I took a class called Development of the American Novel where we read and discuss novels that (our prof. deemed) were instrumental in forming the identity of the American novel. Or something. Among those novels were Charlotte Temple, Wieland, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and The Scarlet Letter, to name a few. Those were okay. Most of these were pretty short (under 200ish pages) with the exception of Huck Finn, which I didn't mind because I legitimately enjoyed the book (though I did end up DNF'ing it when Tom Sawyer showed up. That's another discussion...). This worked in my favor because I don't tend to gravitate towards long books, and if I do they're in audiobook form and I really wanted to read them anyway. By the end of the class, I was a little tired of reading, but figured Christmas break would reinvigorate me and I decided to register for another class, Development of the British Novel (same instructor, same concept) thinking it would be more or less the same. I was wrong.

At the beginning of this semester, I looked at the reading list so I could download the books from Project Gutenberg to put on my kindle. Some of the titles included Moll Flanders, The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, David Copperfield, North &amp; South, and Middlemarch. I noticed the file sizes were kinda big, so I looked up the page counts and oh my god. Moll Flanders, over 400. Humphry Clinker, over 300. David Fucking Copperfield, *over 650 pages*. I knew I would have some trouble, and I did.

I powered through Moll Flanders and Humphy Clinker, with the help of LibriVox. With Moll Flanders, I read along, but with Humphry Clinker, I ditched the text altogether. There was just something about reading all of those words that made my eyes and brain so tired. You could say ""uwu why didn't you buy the physical books that don't emit light"" and the answer is money. My school recently switched to Barnes and Noble for textbooks and now everything is super expensive. Why spend money when I could...not? My kindle was collecting dust anyway. It's the same text, aside from footnotes found in the Norton Critical Edition but those weren't that important. Plus, I didn't have a problem last semester. Anyway, I digress.

I hit a fat brick wall when we got to David Copperfield. I had already expressed my unease to my prof. about the book, but we were still fairly early in the semester so there wasn't any reason to drop books from the list. I knew this would be the case, but I figured telling my prof. that the book would probably be a problem for me would be better than suffering in silence. I gave it a sincere try early on, again solely in audiobook format. I got to chapter 9 before I just couldn't take it anymore. I don't know how better to describe this than that it just felt so full of words. So many words, a few concepts. Were they necessary? Probably, I don't doubt it. It's just that it takes me so long to read, and we had a finite amount of time before moving on to the next book.

Anecdote: I read what I suppose some would consider a lot around 6th-7th grade. I would get in trouble for it during math class, get my books confiscated by teachers, I read when I was supposed to be asleep and my mom would catch me sometimes. I got most of my books from the library because my mom refused to take me to any book store (probably because she knew I would go apeshit and buy a hundred dollars worth of books), and I found it odd that when I checked books out from the library, they only gave you two weeks! That was nowhere near enough time to finish a book, 12-year-old-me thought. I liked to savor my books, withhold reading the next juicy chapter so that it would have a greater effect on me, almost like how a weekly TV show works. I still do this. I could not do this with either of these classes. Instead of the succulent Chinese meal of reading in my youth, these classes became eating contests, and my stomach has finally burst.

The thing is, most of these novels have *really good* stories. Aside from constantly diverting from the story to add paragraphs of *don't do this, ladies!*, Charlotte Temple was melodramatic in the way that some wattpad-tier stories can be, which I kinda love. Humphry Clinker was basically a comedy, and it didn't have a depressing ending like most of the books we read. David Copperfield has some really sad moments that hit you to the core. But, they were all just so verbose; the sheer amount and archaic-ness of the words prevented me from actually getting to the story. As such, I think I have developed a disdain for the ""classics"". I really wish I hadn't, but I can't stomach them anymore.

I have hit another, fatter brick wall. Miss Rona came to town and I had to go home. Our spring break was extended a week, so the syllabus had to be adjusted to accommodate for one less week of classes. I was supposed to somehow shove the other 50-ish chapters of David Copperfield down my throat and read half of North &amp; South before returning (now all of North &amp; South, post-Corona adjustments). I'm sure you can guess that didn't happen. There's a test tomorrow, but that's not what I'm worried about. For this class, like last semester, we have a paper to write. 8 page minimum. No problem! I go to the updated syllabus just to double-check the dates, and I noticed the paper topic has changed completely. Before, we just had to pick a topic connected to the way the British novel has developed over the years. I even had a topic mentally picked out. The new paper topic was that we had to read a book *that we had not read for class* and describe its influence in the development of the British novel. 

I scoured my bookshelf and brain to try and find a novel written by a British person that may have had some kind of impact on British novels today. No dice. I knew I probably wouldn't find anything written before the 1960s, but strangely, most of the authors I had read, for pleasure or school, were American. It's probably because I'm American, but I will say, I did not expect that. So, I googled ""classic novels under 200 pages"" and found some. Most were American, because I guess Americans like to keep things brief, but I eventually settled on Orlando, a Biography by Virginia Woolf. 1928 might be pushing it since most of our novels are pre-1900, but what options did I have? The paper, by the way, is due Thursday. In 3 days. Before, I figured I could make a decent paper on my topic in 6 days, since I planned to begin Saturday. Now, I have to read an entire book and write a paper in way less time, and it has become apparent that I cannot do that. So far, Orlando has been... okay, but there are also long stretches that feel like they're about nothing. I'm listening to the audiobook on 1.5x speed (because time constraints) and reading along, and I'm looking at the words, and they have no meaning. And now the pressure is really on because I have until Thursday. Not to finish the book, to finish the paper. And it's starting to fuck with me now, so much so that I'm considering doing some fucky-wucky mental gymnastics that I *know* won't work to claim ignorance and go with the initial paper topic, just so I can have *something*.

I don't know why I'm telling you all this, it's not like you can do anything haha. This would probably be better for /r/offmychest but...it's book-related? And I'm sure many a english major or creative writing major (or former) can relate. None of this really matters anyway, y'know? A plague is sweeping the nation and I'm complaining about literature?! And besides, I could probably make it out of this class with a C. My pristine GPA and deans-list status would disappear but I never really cared about grades. I'm going to graduate next semester in December, (try to) become a professional video editor, and never do anything literature or book related ever again. And, maybe one day, I can begin to have succulent Chinese meals instead of binge eating.

fs5034,dendang677,What 14-year-old-me thought about Stephen King's Duma Key,"I first started reading Stephen King when I was 14; I first read The Eyes of the Dragon, and that was pretty good, but not exactly a fully satisfying novel. The next of his that I read, *Duma Key*, well... that blew me away. We all have that one memory of that *one* book that opened you up to a whole greater dimension to what reading can bring, something that touches you deeply in ways that at the time, and still to this day, you can't fully articulate. That was *Duma Key* for me.

Every Spring (which was the season while I first read *Duma Key*) makes me think frequently and deeply about the book. And seeing as though it's Spring where I am, I've been thinking about this book lately, and why I loved it so much. The portrayals of memory are one of the first things that come to mind; the white ""blankness"" of Elizabeth after suffering physical brain trauma, how she slowly and fearfully but confidently filled in the white void of her mind with detail, slowly but surely redefining and reshaping the world as she understood it. The first like she makes, the horizon line; Jesus, that part gives me chills sometimes! A single line turns *absolutely nothing* into the most basic, most fundamental quality of a visual interpretation of a tangible world: a horizon line. How that image haunts the story, with the horizon view of the Atlantic, and Edgar Freemantle's frequent gazing out at that horizon while he tries to make sense of his new life at Duma Key... essentially hesitantly but courageously filling in the void of his new reality, like Elizabeth did as a little girl.

How did that impact me so greatly as a 14 year old? I often think about this every Spring, and I never really come to an answer that satisfies me. But it made deep sense to me, and when you're a hormonal teenager and nothing makes sense, when something *does* make sense, man, it becomes a talisman you carry with you. And the memories I hold of getting lost in that wonderful book still radiates a precious warmth inside me.",1,1585623092,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs5034/what_14yearoldme_thought_about_stephen_kings_duma/,books,1

fs4bow,AllyBurgess,The Great Gatsby: Do you consider Nick Carraway to be a hypocrite?,"I recently finished re-reading *The Great Gatsby* (thanks social distancing) and I honestly gleaned a lot more out of it this time than when I least read it for high school English. I still don't regard it as The Great American Novel per se, but I recognize it as being far more complex than I originally thought. Truthfully though, I found Gatsby himself a rather flat and two dimensional character. The real point of interest for me was the narrator Nick Carraway. 

When I first closed the book I sympathized him, but in the days that have passed and as I begin to think about the novel more, I'm starting to wonder if he is also somewhat to blame? I once read Nick described as an idiot because he is guilty of the things he judges others for, and because he objectifies the women in his life and ignores their problems to focus on his own internal problems and feelings. I was wondering to what extent you agreed with this, and how he is a hypocrite. 

I know he claims to be honest and yet gets involved in the affair of Gatsby and Daisy, but at the same time he knew Tom was having an affair and seemed to be conscious of Daisy’s unhappiness at home. So it seemed like he was aware of Daisy’s problems on some level and was trying to help her, unless your interpretation is that his sole motivation was to curry favor with Gatsby. He does describe her voice as being filled with money, but he also seems aware that Daisy is a human and can’t possibly live up to Gatsby’s idealization of her, which I feel suggests he is aware of Daisy as more than just an object, unlike the other men of the book. 

As for Jordan, do you agree or disagree that his break up with her was justified? They were both in on helping the affair but to me it seemed Nick was shocked by Jordan’s callousness towards Myrtle’s death more than anything else. I know that was the quality that initially attracted him to her, but could have he foreseen how callous she would be when confronted with death? So from my perspective, it is Jordan and the other elites who objectified Myrtle as just some meaningless working class mistress, while Nick was the only one conscious of her being a real person. And as for focusing on his own problems, it seemed like he did engage in introspection and self-reflection, but he also seemed to be the only one who cared about the others, especially Gatsby, and didn’t write them off (except Tom) until almost anyone would. He was carrying on an affair with someone back home while with Jordan, which is a flaw, but as far as I could tell Jordan didn’t know about that anyways. So when she called him a clumsy driver at the end and accused him of not being honest and straightforward, what does she mean? Is she just bitter at the way he went about it, or is there some deeper truth that Nick is a hypocrite who objectifies the women in his life and disregards their own problems and issues to focus on his own?

fs4aga,AR131313,Death's Comments on COVID-19,"I really liked the way the character of Death made its observations and comments in The Book Thief and I think the current pandemic could make for some interesting commentary. From the various ways different governments have responded, to the many stories, large and small, good and bad that have come from this disease. 

I can just picture Death observing those who began hoarding more than they needed. Then telling us about the elderly person he would be visiting sooner that expected. How Death felt more important because family was not allowed to be with their relative as they passed. To Death's commentary on those medical professionals who first encountered the virus to those who continue to go back to work every day. Also a story about the person Death kept checking on until returning one day to an empty hospital bed because they made it through. Along with the observations on people following the stay at home orders and how much life has changed from an outside prospective. 

There are many of other situations that could be written about and many tones that could be conveyed. This is just something I have been thinking about for the last few days as I read different stories about what is happening around the world. 

So to Mr. Zusak, if you were to apply this character to current events you already have one interested reader. I am sure Death has been busier recently, perhaps the insight could help us move forward.",1,1585620308,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs4aga/deaths_comments_on_covid19/,books,1

fs3fb1,AwesomeFrito,Just read Spineless: The Science of Jellyfish by Juli Berwald,"Surprised no one has mentioned this book here. I will admit it is not everyone. If you expect it to be straightforward book, all about Jellyfish science, you will be disappointed. It is more of a memoir at times, as the Juli Berwald incorporates her life into the novel on top of all the jellyfish science. You hear all about her travel adventures, her insecurities, her children, and more. The purpose of the book, is that author was seeking to answer the question if jellyfish populations were increasing as result of climate change. 

I had trouble getting past the few chapters especially chapter 3, &gt;!for some reason, Berwald decided that if she was going to write a book about Jellyfish that she needed to taste one. I thought that was quite a large leap and had trouble getting past that specific chapter.!&lt; But once I did it was smooth sailing. I learned so much about jellyfish. I learned about how jellyfish move in the water, how they sting, what they eat, there different life cycles, how some glow, and more. Some of this knowledge I shared on reddit in the [r/todayilearned](https://old.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) sub.

I think part of what made the book more enjoyable for me was that I experimented with it. This the was first book, that I bought novel and audiobook together. I would read and follow along as it was being read. I discovered that the information from the book lasts longer in my head, when I do it this way.

All jokes aside. I thought it was a fantastic book. It perfectly reads out both the fascination and dreaded horror that the filiviruses caused on both Preston and some of the characters in the book. Some passages from the book strangely reminded me of Jurassic Park. Those first Jurassic Park moments where you don't really know what you're dealing with, but at the same time it beckons a profound fascination towards something that is an archaic but ferocious predator. I had no idea Ebola could be so messed up. The scenes of death conjured up by Preston are so horrific that they seem to be out of a B list horror movie, with added blood and sensational gore.

Additionally, I've found the following ISBNs:

 - ISBN-10: 8445072137
 - ISBN-13: 978-8445072134

fs0idv,lukejmcgrath,Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone by JK Rowling,"Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is without doubt the most important book I’ve ever read. The act of reading this novel has unquestionably changed who I am.

To understand what I mean, I need to take you back many years to 1997. In June, Bloomsbury publish Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. In September, I start Secondary School. There’s a huge buzz around the book but it feels too young for me and I never get round to reading it. At this point I’d read most of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter seemed like a backwards step.

Fast forward to 2001, Daniel Radcliffe stars in the film adaptation. I’m now 15, dark-haired, wear glasses, keep quiet and am often the smartest or best performer in class. I’m not a nerd or an outcast, I play rugby for the school and have plenty of friends.

At some point, I don’t remember who or when, someone connects the three of us (Harry, Daniel and me). For the most part it’s Harry that I’m compared to, as far as I remember for the resemblance.

I’d been bullied before, would be bullied again and would bully people. For some reason, the only thing that I have never been able to shake is the feeling of persecution and worthlessness when I’m called Harry. It was by no means a new nickname for me, those who called me by it were usually older and would soon move on. Yet, it stuck with me long after it was said. The more I reacted, the more people would drop it in.

I wondered for a while if the people calling me Harry were intimidated by me. By our nature, we bully those who are smarter or more successful than us, trying to make them seem more human than the idealised version we have in our minds.

I’d like to say I never bullied again after this started, but who would believe that. As we get trodden on by bigger people, so we step on those smaller than us.

This went on throughout school, with no-one knowing I was so cut up about it. I learned to laugh it off and try to own in. This led to the worst event, where I was invited to a party of a boy in the year above me on the condition that I turned up as Harry Potter. All my friends were going, so I pretended I thought it was funny too and turned up in full fancy dress with broomstick and all. To this day, that is the least dignified I have felt. I traded my soul for a party.

After school, the names changed as Radcliffe become more popular in his own right. I’d even get some appreciation from girls who fancied him. Yet, even at university the occasionally “You’re a wizard Harry” would drift in from someone walking past me and I’d crumble inside.

It took 15 years before I was comfortable enough with myself to sit down and enjoy reading Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. A decade and a half of ignoring books and films that many around me love, because it still reminded me of the feelings I used to get in the depths of my stomach. I’ve done much braver things in that time, dealt with bigger problems, but never cracked it until now.

I don’t know if it’s because I’m a father of two, happy in my career or just finally old enough to let go, but picking up the paperback felt important. As I read, I enjoyed myself and felt ridiculous for avoiding a harmless book for so long.

The first Harry Potter novel is one of those special books that young and adult readers can both understand and enjoy in their own ways. Superficially, there’s a coming-of-age, magical adventure story with a clear structure, villain and battle. Look deeper, and it deals with class, racism, bullying, coming to terms with ourselves and realising we each have strengths. There’s no age at which those lessons can’t help a reader. Perhaps the only real flaw is the oddly quick way in which the conclusion unfolds, which feels anticlimactic and unnecessarily forced.

It’s been a long journey, but I finally understand what Harry Potter means to me. Being told you’re a wizard is one thing, but embracing it is something much more important.",5,1585606413,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fs0idv/harry_potter_and_the_philosophers_stone_by_jk/,books,1

frzp57,h3xag0nSun,Finnegan’s Wake tools?,"Just wondering if anyone can recommend any books that would help me with my reading of Finnegan’s Wake. I have Joseph Campbell &amp; Henry Morton Robinson’s Skeleton Key to Finnegan’s Wake but I’m not necessarily looking for a breakdown of each and every reference, sentence by sentence. I’m more interested in finding material that would give me a more general framework to help add context to my understanding of Finnegan’s Wake in a more broad sense. I’m wondering if reading other James Joyce novels would help, or if there are perhaps other Irish centric books that would give me a more informed reference point. As a Canadian millennial I suspect that even the most basic cultural references are flying by, way overhead.

Even without any help I enjoy reading the book, I just figured maybe there’s something out there that would help illuminate the journey a little more.

My mum and I were talking about this earlier, because we were wondering what sort of influence this current situation, (we are on lock-down in the UK) will have on literature or other media. 

In 10 years, will we be reading books or plays about that year that no-one could leave their houses?

I know about 'The Decameron', but it's not really about the plague, and I'm struggling to think of anything else.

fryq5l,Luziqix,What is your favorite quote/passage and why?,"Hello all. I don’t know about you guys, but although I do find some nice quotes while reading, there are only a few quotes that really stick with me. I’d like to know what your favorite quote from a book is and why it resonates with you. I’d like this to be a discussion of quotes and not just short answers. 

My favorite quote is from “Call Me By Your Name” by André Aciman. (For context, the passage is about the main character playing a piano piece)

“I knew exactly what phrase in the piece must have stirred him the first time, and each time I played it, I was sending it to him as a little gift, because it was really dedicated to him, as a token of something very beautiful in me that would take no genius to figure out and that urged me to throw in an extended cadenza. Just for him.”

I found Call Me By Your Name really poetic, and there were a lot quotes and passages I loved, but this quote above resonated with me on a level I have a hard time explaining. It’s not that I recognize myself in the passage or that it reminds me of a loved one. I’m not sure what it is, really, but it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve read and every time I read it a sort of calm feeling and hope breeze through my body. I’ve never felt like this before with anything I’ve read, but it’s almost like I’m in love with the passage itself, which sounds really weird, I know, but I can’t explain it any other way.

When I ask “What’s your favorite quote/passage”, I’m really asking: What’s a quote that has stuck with you in a way that resembles the same warm feeling of being in love? (Or maybe not that extreme... but basically a quote that really resonates with you)",22,1585600591,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fryq5l/what_is_your_favorite_quotepassage_and_why/,books,1

For me I hate giving up on books. Even when I've found myself really not enjoying one I will always try to finish it. 
One of the main reasons for this is that I'm in denial that I dislike a book until I've finished it and can say for sure. One of my faviorate books I really didn't enjoy reading until 40% of the way through (Dr Strange and Mr Norelle). It got to the point where it finally clicked for me and from then on I couldn't put it down. The down side to this is a book series where I end up finishing the first book and then have no motivation to read the rest. My brother gifted me the book trilogy Across the Nightingale floor and after struggling to finish the first book I honestly don't feel any inclination to finish the other two and it sucks :(

In music, a lot of top producers, like Will.I.Am know how to reverse engineer a hit.  But can we say the same about books? 

My instinct is that it's possible in the thriller, murder mystery, romance, and scifi, and probably JA genres.  Not sure about literary fiction though.

frwum5,Garwyx,Why would giving too many fucks lead one to feel entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times? (from The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck by Mark Manson),"In his book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Mark Manson states that consumer culture and social media breed the idea that happiness comes from more, but argues happiness comes not from giving a fuck about more, but giving a fuck only about what aligns with one's personal values.

&amp;#x200B;

In chapter 1, subsection The Feedback Loop from Hell, page 27, Mark says:

&amp;#x200B;

""Because **when you give too many fucks**—when you give a fuck about everyone and everything—**you will feel that you’re perpetually entitled to be comfortable and happy at all times, that everything is supposed to be just exactly the fucking way** ***you*** **want it to be**. This is a sickness. And it will eat you alive. You will see every adversity as an injustice, every challenge as a failure, every inconvenience as a personal slight, every disagreement as a betrayal. You will be confined to your own petty, skull-sized hell, burning with entitlement and bluster, running circles around your very own personal Feedback Loop from Hell, in constant motion yet arriving nowhere.""

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot follow this reasoning. If something, let's say an awesome car, is important to me because it aligns with my values (i.e. I give a fuck), I am willing to work and suffer to get it. If it does not align, I let it go and don't give a fuck about it. But if I feel entitled, I give a fuck about getting the car but am not willing to suffer for it.

Does Mark have it backwards? Does feeling entitled lead to giving a fuck about everything instead of the other way?",7,1585594835,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frwum5/why_would_giving_too_many_fucks_lead_one_to_feel/,books,1
frwu74,DonKoogrr,13 Year Old reading waaaay above appropriate levels?,"I had a fun conversation about books with my niece recently and she was super excited to show me what she was reading. It was a James Rollins novel, part of a series, and she insisted that I read the bit in the back that previews the next book.


I wind up reading the first few pages of The Judas Strain and am careful to not say anything about her age or choice in reading materials. I make some comments about the way the Nazi is describing the beautiful young half-jew brilliant scientist (very r/menwritingwomen style stuff) and let her see how excited I am about the literary hooks. I make note that the book starts with the graphic description of a child's corpse rotting in a sewer. We end the conversation by googling the Nordic rune included in the blurb.


I don't know what to do or whether I should do anything at all. I'm thrilled that she is genuinely so excited and is apparently devouring these books. I love that she gets to share her love of these books with her father. I'm simply...uneasy about the themes. Does anyone have any advice? I thought she'd be at 'Narnia' levels at this age, or 'Redwall'.


I also don't want to read it myself. When I was her age I read my way through Dean Koontz's bibliography and sort of burned myself out of heavy topic real world thrillers.

fru6o5,thyroidnos,Les Miserables,"Yes I have a lot of free time now. I devoured this book in about four days. I didn’t expect such a readable and enjoyable novel. Hugo is every bit the story teller of a Dumas but a far better writer (I previously read the Count of Monte Cristo). Even more rare he is a great writer who also has such compassion and soul. There’s great nobility in his writing.

Of critique, there are many portions which you can omit or skim. I’d estimate about 200 pages here and there. You’ll know it when you come upon it. In fact I’d urge you start the novel a chapter before the main character is introduced about 50 pages in. Hugo has other motives then just advancing a story along, some of which may not interest the reader. That’s ok of course.

I’d also say that Les Miserables goes one leg too long. It’s rather sadistic the torment he puts upon Jean Valjean. Too much melodrama seeps in at the end.

Anyone know how Hunchback stacks up against Les Mis? Also does Hugo have other overlooked novels?",5,1585586413,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fru6o5/les_miserables/,books,1

It's incredibly creepy at times, which i found surprising, since the idea of a ""haunted car"" might seem a bit corny or stupid.
This story is a curious cross between true nostalgia and horror but also about obsession and possesion.

The book is heavily character driven, I loved all the characters, even with their flaws.

""Christine"" is Stephen King at his best.

frt7qx,klmm88,The Giver - not what I remember,"One of my favorite books in my early teens was The Giver by Lois Lowry. I even found a signed copy at a recycled book store for $2.50 and it has held a place of honor on my bookshelf. 

I recently re-read it for the first time since I was a teenager, and I cant help but feel a little uncomfortable. It is far more disturbing than I remember. Looking back, I am pretty sure what I loved about it when I was younger was the idea of being singled out in your community to receive all the knowledge of society. The passing along of memories and wisdom. But that isn't really what the book is about. Its about being the only person in your society that is awake to the choices you are being denied. Its about population control, thought control, behavior control. 

I have never been a fan of post apocalyptic stories. I much prefer the optimism of bringing humanity back from the brink, or defending goodness in the face of evil. So the fact that nothing in the community can change, and Jonas' only option is to run away and save himself leaves me feeling desolate.",850,1585583304,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frt7qx/the_giver_not_what_i_remember/,books,1

One of my favorite things about what I consider Golden Era sci-fi writers is their ability to craft a specific language or set of slang to which fits the universe they create, such as Robert Heinlein's ""Grok"" from Stranger in a Strange Land, or in the case of Huxley: Pneumatic.

The use of Pneumatic in Brave New World is liken to ""Thicc"" in our current vernacular. I think that Pneumatic is a far better word.

It's more descriptive and when I visualize the word, provides a much better imagery than Thicc ever has.

I propose that we adopt this word as the new standard, since we're basically living in a Sci-Fi dystopia anyway and may as well get ahead of the curve.",23,1585581617,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frsp3l/started_reading_aldous_huxleys_brave_new_world/,books,1

frph87,Ollie_Randall,The Mirror and the Light,"I've just finished Hilary Mantel's *The Mirror and the Light*, which was released in early March. Who else has read it yet?

My biggest problem was that I read the first two parts of her *Wolf Hall* trilogy years ago, which meant that although I knew what was going on in the plot, I'd forgotten the subtleties of Cromwell's relationships with Wriothesley, Wyatt, Fitzwilliam etc. And the book is all about these subtleties, so I definitely lost out here.

I feel that the first two thirds (ie the first six hundred pages!) were, with hindsight, a bit of a slog. They lacked *Wolf Hall'*s heady sense of upward momentum, and the tight, focused plot arc of *Bring Up The Bodies.* But the payoff in the final third, as Cromwell comes face to face with the stark realities of power and proves incapable of saving himself from the terrifying force of nature that is King Henry, I found extremely powerful and moving. Cromwell's head is a fascinating place to be, which is good, because readers have now been there for something like two and a half thousand pages...

Could Cromwell have avoided his fate? I'm not sure he could have. His weaknesses and his wrong moves were only human. He did so much right and yet in the end he was comprehensively defeated.

frkmv4,jamsin_11,I personally prefer physical copies of books to Kindles.,"This isn't a very popular opinion, but I much favour flipping through the pages of a book to scrolling on a screen. 

I am aware that it isn't as efficient and not as good for the environment, but there's just this feeling of authenticity when you get cosy, open up a thick book and bury yourself in a world of imagination. The smell, the comfort of the pages in your hands, everything is truly so authentic, as opposed to repeatedly swiping a screen.

My favourite part of owning a physical copy in reaching the last page. Because when you shut that book, you are caught in a moment of bliss, of recognition. ""I just finished that book,"" you'd proudly think, and put it away knowing that you achieved your goal.

frid5t,jonadane,The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris got me reading again,"So I have a similar story to a lot of millenials / older gen z kids. I inhaled books at a frightening speed and huge volume as a kid right through to my teenage years, and then stopped ''being able to read'' as I reached my late teens and early 20s.

I attribute this to becoming so used to consuming text in a format made for the internet that my eyes now automatically jump around on a page of writing as if searching for hyperlinks. I pick out important information and then have to go back and read the parts of a page I missed, and this happens over and over again, making reading books a slow, annoying process that takes forever. I've been unable to finish books for years no matter how hard I've tried to get back into the swing of things, let alone concentrate long enough in one sitting to actually get immersed in the story.

But I bought The Silence of the Lambs and it hooked me right away. Despite that, I felt hopeless because in sitting after sitting I still only managed to get through 36 pages over the course of several months. Fast forward to this period of self-isolation and I decided to really commit to giving it another go. The first few days were very hard in terms of concentrating.

But I downloaded some white noise apps and put my headphones in while I read, and that was the first thing that helped me focus. The other thing I did was fold a piece of paper up and use it to conceal the parts of the page I hadn't got to yet, 'scrolling' down as I read each line. It really helped stop me from jumping ahead in the text.

I read 9 pages on day 1, an average of 34 pages over the next couple of days, and I didn't need the white noise anymore by Day 3. Then the number of pages I read in a day jumped into double digits. I read the whole novel in 5 days. I found myself completely immersed in the book, and it's the first time I've experienced that since childhood!

I've seen the film about 3 times, but knowing what happens did not change the intensity that Harris builds up throughout the story. It's beautifully written and very fast paced, I swear there wasn't a boring moment. It was sublime. I highly, highly recommend this novel to anyone who has had the same problems as me!",41,1585534545,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frid5t/the_silence_of_the_lambs_by_thomas_harris_got_me/,books,1

frhsis,pinkhorrorstory,"The Shining, a novel by Stephen King","As a quarantine activity, I read the totality of The Shining in four days. And I have opinions. Also I can't find how to add a flair but, SPOILERS AHEAD. 

King is an awful writer. He has good ideas for movies, but when translated to a book they could be good if he didn't want to make the most basic event as long as he can, that result in an unnecessarily long book that even on the climax turns to be tedious. The plot could do well on, let's say 300 pages. I don't know how many pages american editions have, but mine has over 600 (I read one translated to spanish so I really have no clue). 

The ending felt VERY stupid, really? an explosion? That's the only way you could win over the hotel? Okay. 

Yes I did read it fast but the only reason is because it felt like going through a very long and detailed movie script. It's mot hard to read at all. I still didn't like it. 

The main reason for this post is HOW DO YOU PEOPLE LIKE IT? It's awful, the beggining felt like something interesting could come and become great but jeez. From like a third in you could see how it would end, and not because the movie is popular.

I know King was a really big part in forming how the genre of horror (both in film and literature) became what it is today. That does not mean he's good. Sorry, I somewhat like him as a man, but I can't like him as a writer. Would never read something from him again (it's not the first time I read King before you come in the comments saying b-but, you have not read anything else, how can YOU JUDGE OUR KING??).",0,1585532264,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frhsis/the_shining_a_novel_by_stephen_king/,books,1

frejw6,Drew_Ferran,Finished the Mistborn Era 2 trilogy. My thoughts.,"I thought the series was okay. However, the first trilogy was *a lot* better. I think the mystery behind everything in the world made me like them better than the second era books. 

The Alloy of Law (#4) and Shadows of Self (#5) were great though. They had their fair share of twists and surprises. I enjoyed The Bands of Mourning (#6) more than the other two books. Again, it came down to learning about the mysteries of the past. Some things were predictable in each book, other things I was surprised by. 

The characters were interesting. Wayne would probably be my favorite. He has different aspects of his identity that you might not expect. Keeps you on your toes. Boy, he loves his hats. 

Next, I’m going to read the extra Mistborn books in Arcanum Unbound. I’m looking forward to reading Mistborn: Secret History. Afterwards, I’m probably going to take a break from Brandon Sanderson’s books to read Age of Death (The Legends of the First Empire #5) by Michael Sullivan. I’ve been wanting to read that one for a while. Then I’d read Warbreaker. 

Overall, I enjoyed both trilogies and I highly recommend people read them. What are your thoughts on these two series?",6,1585520344,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frejw6/finished_the_mistborn_era_2_trilogy_my_thoughts/,books,4

frddws,nublood30,Innocence by Roald Dahl- The book that made me realize the horrors of Human Nature.,"I've always seen this name Roald in many children's books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or The BFG, wonderful and color stories for kids to enjoy. But I never knew I would be so engaged in this person's life and how I didn't know that Dahl is a masterful storyteller even in the context of adult and horror. 

 

This mind blown me about human nature, how we slowly lose our innocence and continue to grip ourselves to reality. He lived a fun and butt-bleeding life and created stories about how evil stems through humans and plunge ourselves through it. From stories like how people would sacrifice others and themselves for wealth, people twisting their personas to get what they want or how trauma can feel like we are circling ourselves through hell when we experience it again. Dahl was not all about child fantasies.



He showed that our minds slowly gets messed up, it was blinded by happiness and bliss in our childhood, and later opened it to horrors of realizations and realities when we reach adolescence which I realized a lot about the fear of being aware of that. 



There is actually a series of Autobiographical and collection of short stories about Dahl, most about certain issues like war, deception and basically about Human Nature and I am looking forward to read more about this person's life and his masterful craft in fiction. Any thoughts about the book I will happily discuss it with you.",251,1585516191,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frddws/innocence_by_roald_dahl_the_book_that_made_me/,books,13
frcybb,go-bleep-yourself,"The ""Best"" Books are the ""Most Famous"" Ones. Yes, No, Maybe?","Books can be a serious time and attention commitment compared to other forms of entertainment, so when I read for pleasure, I only want ""good"" books. I'll keep my focus just on novels, here.  

For example, I just finished Magpie Murders, which has been mentioned on this sub many times.  It was rather good.  Also, read ""The Hating Game"", which was excellent, and is very well-known in the rom-com genre.  I read ""Da Vinci Code""  over a decade after it came out, and I thought, yeah, the story is pretty good and thrilling.

There is the thought that the cream rises to the top, and so if I only read the famous books, I'll lower my risk of disappointment.  There are a lot of reasons why certain books become well-known, including great PR, but if you are a late adopter like me, many of the lousy ones get weeded out.   At some point, the negative GoodReads reviews will come out, or the book just fades into obscurity. 

But then I wonder, what about the books that were good and fall to the wayside? What do those books have in common? Is it mostly cases of publishing politics, sexism, racism, etc. or something else? And how do I find these good non-famous books? 

I'd love to get the sub's perspective on this; particularly from folks that work in publishing.  What are some good books from less famous authors that just didn't get the attention it deserved? And why didn't it?",13,1585514688,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frcybb/the_best_books_are_the_most_famous_ones_yes_no/,books,0

frco64,Theramseyofhell,"""The Devil All the Time"" open-minded venting","So for starters, I used to read a lot but I haven't read much of anything the last few years. I've really wanted to get back into reading so I recently picked up this book and got roughly 3/4 of the way through it but I've had to put it down. 

I'm really curious about what people love about this book. Generally I would say I'm a fan of darker stories. The Millennium series or Lovecraft's stories are probably my favorites as far as things I've read goes, but ""The Devil All the Time"" has somehow managed to tick all the boxes for what I usually like and also be so disturbing/disgusting that I haven't really enjoyed reading any part of it.

I don't want to totally give up on this book because I feel like with, how well recieved it is, I must be missing something. Is there a message in the brutality of this story that I've possibly missed?

frch55,ayysizzle,"Just finished the Dystopian Trio of Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451 for the first time. I can not believe it’s taken me this long!","About 3 years ago I decided that I wanted to read more after seeing a list of “The 100 books to read before you die” and realizing that while I had been assigned a few of them in school, I had actually read none of them. Thus began my journey to be well-read and I quickly started amassing a library of classics and essential non-fiction (way more than I could possibly need at one time as my TBR list kept growing, but so it goes). 

Today I finished *Brave New World* which concluded the Dystopian Trio, and all I can say is **wow**!

I began with *Fahrenheit 451* which I think has my favorite story of the three. I love the world Bradbury builds and I also loved the concept of how insipid society becomes without books. The ending of Guy sitting around a bunch of like minded people watching the bombing of the city the fled was great. 

Next was *1984* which I actually read in a day. And again, the world Orwell builds is just fantastic. The hopelessness both Winston and you as the reader feel toward the party is so well done. Every possible solution one could think of as a way to revolt is stamped out emphatically. And in the end he and Julia become just as all the rest. 

Finally, today, I finished *Brave New World*. This definitely takes the cake for most interesting world in my opinon. The whole novel I thought it would be horrible to go against the government and society, like in *1984*, and that The Savage or Bernard or Helmholtz would be punished severely. Finding out at the end that if you didn’t want the uniformity and ubiquitous happiness of the society you could easily go to an island somewhere with others who felt that way was an awesome development. The dialogue between The Savage and Mustapha Mond at the end about their differences was also exceptional. 

Recently finished *Animal Farm* and *Lord of the Flies* as well. Next up is *We* by Zamyatin and *Darkness at Noon* by Koestler, which I’ve seen recommended here a lot in regards to these three. Dystopias might be my new favorite genre, and these three are definitely in the top tier, I’m glad I can finally understand why. 


Anyone else who read these have recommendations or other books I might like?",31,1585513013,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/frch55/just_finished_the_dystopian_trio_of_brave_new/,books,46

frc62l,Algmtkrr,How can I get the most out of nonfiction books without taking so many notes?,"For the past few years I’ve loved to read nonfiction and learn through books rather than textbooks, but in the process I’ve become more conscious of how I learn. I need to write things down, even small little details that clarify a bigger concept or introduce an interesting tangent, and my notes then become a very useful reference if I want to review or connect with other books. It must be a remnant from how my study habits got me through college tests and essays.

However, this process has also made me more conscious of how I forget details that I want to remember if I don’t write them down. It’s become more difficult for me to just casually listen to an audiobook because I’ll feel the need to take notes so that I won’t have to revisit a book that I just wanted to casually listen to in the first place!

So my question is, for the avid nonfiction readers, how do you deal with this kind of situation? Do you try to build your memory and not rely as much on archived notes? Do you accept that the book is just a casual read and the points remembered after-the-fact were the only ones I should quickly record? Are notes even worthwhile for something that’s supposed to be a casual read? Or is this simply a necessary consequence of more intense nonfiction reading where notes are required, so I should just take better quicker notes and take breaks with purely casual nonfiction or fiction audiobooks?

It felt like at least 3 disconnected books joined together to make something of length - the University (again); the Maer with the poisoning that never led anywhere; the whole Adem thing and an attempt at some sort of mystical writing with the Fae. There was really almost no attempt at a through story and only the odd small paragraph where Kvothe remembered he'd had a life and dreams and hopes and friends prior to each new episode - and these could have been shoehorned in by an editor. Am I right that the author just joined 3 or 4 unconnected works in progress together to make a whole?

Then the whole Fae sex thing, especially given the care to establish Denna, was beyond weird. Sex and attitudes to women in general in this book were really uncomfortable to read. 

Finally the final murders of the fake troupe felt so out of place and unmotivated. So he just kills women like that. For honor. OK then. Moving on.",4,1585501070,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr91m3/some_thoughts_about_the_wise_mans_fear/,books,0

fr8glh,TheCountofNotreDame,Writers like Dan Simmons,"While I have been making my way through Dan Simmon's novels (see list below of those works I have read) it appears to me that Dan is slowing down on producing new works.  I've yet to find another writer whose combination of literary prose, plot pacing, and character development matches my taste in literature perfectly.  In short, Dan Simmons is my favorite author.  You can tell that Dan has a breadth of knowledge regarding those writers who came before him (i.e. Shakespeare)  - he  lived a lifetime before embarking on being a writer.  Excerpted from his website below, I especially think bullet points #1, 2, 8 and 9 are what Dan Simmon's novels achieve.

With that said, what other writers are similar to Dan Simmons?  No I don't mean in topic (don't suggest me Stephen King because Summer of Night is similar to IT in theme), but in actual writing chops and plot pacing.  I read all fiction genres, including fantasy, horror and science fiction, and first and foremost the craft of the story and the attention to detail of the writing style are what make a novel a 5-star read.  Appreciate any comments you might - love this shared community that we have.

Hyperion/Endymion series, Summer of Night, The Terror, Carrion Comfort, Song of Kali

""**📷****Mark Twain’s Rules of Writing**

(Freely adapted from his essay on the Literary Offenses of James Fenimore Cooper)

1) A story shall accomplish something and arrive somewhere.

2) The parts of a story shall be necessary parts of the story and shall help develop it.

3) The people in the story (characters) shall be alive, except in the case of the corpses, and the reader should be able to tell the corpses from the others.

4) The people in the story, both dead and alive, shall show a sufficient excuse for being there.

5) The talk in a story (dialogue) shall sound like human talk, should be talk such as a human being would be likely to talk in the given circumstances, should be interesting to the reader, should help out the tale, and should stop when the people cannot think of anything more to say.

6) When the author describes a character in his story, the conduct and conversation of that person shall justify the description.

7) The author and characters shall confine themselves to possibilities and let miracles alone – or, if they must venture a miracle, the author must make it look possible and reasonable.

8) The author should make the reader feel a deep interest in the characters of the story. The characters should be real enough that the reader will love the good ones, hate the bad ones, and care what happens to all of them.

9) The characters shall be so clearly defined that the reader can tell beforehand what each will do in a given emergency.

In addition to these large rules, there are some little ones:

The author shall . . . .

10) SAY what he wants to say, not merely come near it.

11) Use the right word, not its second cousin.

12) Avoid a surplus of words.

13) Eschew obfuscation.

14) NOT leave out necessary details.

15) Avoid laziness in writing style.

16) Use good grammar.

17) Employ a simple and straightforward style.""",2,1585498973,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr8glh/writers_like_dan_simmons/,books,1

fr8c2a,spicytacotuesday,"I imagined Ba'alzamon, The Dark One, from The Wheel of Time series as Dennis from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and now I can't unsee it","So I don't know if anything like this has happened to you guys before, but late last year I began reading *The Wheel of Time* series and was able to create distinct, original images in my head of most of the primary characters based on their descriptions. However, when I was first given the description Ba'alzamon, the titular antagonist of the entire series, for some reason my mind immediately conjured the image of Dennis Reynolds from the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,* and that image has been burned into my head ever since.

I have tried my best to visualize other interpretations of the Dark One, but whenever he reappears in the books my mind immediately jumps to the same image of Dennis and I have to fight myself to try to change it. What's worse, I've even started visualizing his dialogue and mannerisms in the same way Dennis acts in the show. At this point, I'm about halfway through book 3 and have begrudgingly accepted the fact that, in my vision of the story, this vast and fantastical world full of interesting people and creatures that Robert Jordan has created is being threatened with annihilation by a guy who looks like Glenn Howerton.",5,1585498503,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr8c2a/i_imagined_baalzamon_the_dark_one_from_the_wheel/,books,1

fr7vmi,mybrainblinks,A Good King: Leadership Model from C.S. Lewis's children's literature,"I am reading *Narnia* books with my son and just finished *A Horse and His Boy.* I thought the words of King Lune were worth pausing for:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""But, Father, couldn't you make whichever you like to be the next King?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""No. The king's under the law, for it's the law makes him a king. Hast no more power to start away from thy crown than any sentry from his post....For this is what it means to be a king: to be first in every desperate attack and last in every desperate retreat, and when there's hunger in the land (as must be now and then in bad years) to wear finer clothes and laugh louder over a scantier meal than any man in your land.""

&amp;#x200B;

One more observation (spoiler alert, kinda) in the last paragraph of the book: I notice this comment on love between imperfect people. So, yeah, all of us.

&gt;Aravis also had many quarrels (and, I'm afraid, even fights) with Cor, but they always made it up again: so that years later, when they were grown up, they were so used to quarreling and making up again that they got married so as to go on doing it more conveniently.

&amp;#x200B;

I think good children's literature makes good anyone literature. But it has a special way of condensing ethics without hitting one over the head with it. 

Thoughts are welcomed. I feel that my own commentary on these passages, here, would detract from them; and miss the point.",5,1585496827,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr7vmi/a_good_king_leadership_model_from_cs_lewiss/,books,1

fr6ni6,terminus84,Subreddit Moderation,"This is a great community with a ton of members but, because of a lack of moderation and a constant influx of new users who are likely new readers, the conversation seems to focus on the same books all the time and then the posts that raise to the top, because they're the books most have read, rise to the top filtering out everything else. It'd be nice if there were some sort of moderation system in place so that we could discuss different books. 

Some music subreddits I've visited have great moderation rules in place. /r/ElectronicMusic has a rule where if something has been posted in the last six months, your post gets removed. /r/Metal has a list of bands that have been banned by the subreddit for being posted too frequently, where anything posted by the bands on the banned list gets removed. This list also functions as a quick reference for anyone new to the subreddit or to metal in general can quickly look at the most popular bands.

Those aren't the only methods to go about it and I'm sure /r/books would need one that works for it. I'm not suggesting this in an effort to gatekeep but to keep the conversation from stagnating as it always seems to do in here. Almost everyone in here has read 1984, Dune, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings (these aren't the only books/ series I have in mind, just examples).

Decided it was high time I moved the books I'd been storing there, only thing is they were stored in two unsealed boxes so the books (or at least the ones closest to the top) have a fine layer of garage/outdoorsy dust and dirt. Probably all kinds of bugs have wandered over them at some point as well. 

The books themselves aren't damaged in any way, they're just dirty. I have a bit of a thing about germs so I want to know the best way to clean them? 

My current plan was to sit outside on a warm day, flap the books around a bit to try and get rid of dust clinging to the pages, and then maybe give the covers a swipe with antibacterial wipes. But I don't know if that's the best way to go about it.

I’m excited to hear your thoughts. And I’m sure I don’t need to say this to a group of readers, but here it is: don’t be afraid to think outside the box because everything could be of value.

Reading and watching movies is addicting since there are so much good entertainment out there, but some people aren't handling boredom indoors well, so I figured that helping people to consume better content leads to more pleasant experience.

Book about entertainment as solution to handle cabin fever. Book about book, movie, game and activity recommendations.

fr2z5a,BetaGameTester,How do you go in depth of a book and analyse it?,I don't know why my interest or disinterest in books is effected by opinions. At times I just feel like I'm too dumb to make a decision on my own. I can't read in depth like others do. I don't understand how people come to discussing plot and characters in so much depth. What am I even lacking? At this point I feel like I can't differentiate between good and bad writing. I'll just almost enjoy anything until people point out the flaws. The only thing I can tell is if there's a book that has the same repetitive plot theme and the only new thing it has to offer is the new names of the characters otherwise it's like every other book with the same plot. Which would obviously bore me and force me out of the book halfway.,3,1585472414,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr2z5a/how_do_you_go_in_depth_of_a_book_and_analyse_it/,books,1

fr27q1,MtChessAThon,How to read more books. My two cents. Please also share your own tips for reading more.,"Hi, I see a lot of threads saying 'I used to read all the time when I was younger but now I just can't be bothered/ don't have time' whatever reason, you name it. I felt the same until recently but I have managed to read about a book per month in the past half a year (which is a lot for me) so thought I would share my top tips for getting back into reading.

1.) Start with a book you actually enjoy.

Sounds really obvious but recently I read Pierce Brown's Red Rising in like 2 weeks after a few false starts with other books. I saw a book tuber (The Book Castle) recommend it as a grown up take on the YA genre and I just thought - 'yep, I'll finish that' , and I did! I actually wanted to find out how the story ended each time I picked the book up - it was so exciting - if you don't get that feeling then give it a miss. Life is too short!


2.) Keep your book with you at all times - this so you can find 'that space' in your day when you personally feel like picking up the book and doing some reading.

If you've followed my first tip then this one is a natural addition. Reading is actually a task that takes up concentration in my view - even though it is relaxing it still takes brain power.. so you need to find that moment in your day when you have some time when you're not working or dealing with your family or too tired or whatever and you have some uninterrupted time to get lost in a book. I find my bus commute returning home from work (when I'm not working from home) is a good space/ time for me personally to read , for example. If you carry the book with you it enables you to find 'that reading moment ' with ease. 

If anyone else has any practical tips for getting back into reading more, please share :)",3,1585467843,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fr27q1/how_to_read_more_books_my_two_cents_please_also/,books,1

fqzhiv,p1nkbear,Possible connection between ‘The Descent’ by Jeff Long and ‘The Descent’ the movie?,"So I read The Descent by Jeff Long a few months ago, and it was a phenomenal book, one of the best I’ve personally read in a long time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys horror novels with a touch of existential strangeness. 

I’m also a big horror movie fan, and recently I rewatched the 2005 movie The Descent. I noticed some pretty interesting similarities between the two - namely the title, obviously, but also the ‘monsters’ involved and the setting. 

To be clear, I’m not trying to say that this is due to plagiarism because they really are both great pieces of media if you ask me, and despite their similarities, they’re different enough that they each function fine on their own and don’t feel unoriginal at all. In fact, the only thing that made me notice the similarities in the first place was the fact that they share a title. 

(I will mention here that the book came out first, just for clarity, but I think it’s more likely that the movie might’ve just had a bit of inspiration from the book rather than actively trying to copy it.) 

I’ve checked online and from what I can tell, there’s no official connection between the two. But I am wondering if anyone else noticed these similarities as well out of curiosity.",11,1585454656,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqzhiv/possible_connection_between_the_descent_by_jeff/,books,1

fqws7s,So_Much_Bullshit,"Dune. I thought it would be ""eh."" It was ""eh.""","I just finished up *Dune* today.  I've read a lot in the science fiction genre, and all others, too. I've heard about it forever and decided to finally bite the bullet and read it.

I didn't have too much problems following the new names and locations or anything else in *Dune*. It was not very difficult reading. Tolstoy's *War and Peace* made everything afterwords pretty easy. *War and Peace* - now that's a difficult book. I've also read all the books in Patrick O'Brian's *Master and Commander* series, which is way more difficult than *Dune* with new lingo and settings. James Joyce's stuff is pretty intense, too. I'm reading him now.

I didn't enjoy *Dune* because it was just boring. Not because it was difficult. It was one of those books that I felt I had to finish, because everyone else said it is so great, but it was just a disappointment. And, science fiction and fantasy has always been my first real genre that I loved. I mean, it wasn't *horrible*. I didn't *hate* it. I guess it just didn't live up to the hype for me.


Oh, well, I guess it's like a celebrity that everybody thinks is great looking, and you look at him or her and go, ""eh."" I know everyone probably has had that experience, where you just don't understand what everyone sees in someone else. So, *Dune* is just ""eh"" for me.

.

**EDIT:** I think maybe I feel this way because I read the book maybe later in life, after reading a lot of other 1st rate literature.

fqwrsx,danielgoncalves7,"""The Girl Before""'s plot twist is extremely dumb","I really didn't like the plot twist. To the point I'm now considering returning the book. I left a 2-star review on it too.

Maybe I'm remembering and that's partly the reason I wanted to post this here, maybe I'm being unfair and the fault is on me, but when Emma kicks Simon out I clearly remember I was thinking ""Oh Simon is the murderer!! He's clearly unstable and he will break in"". And that's when the narrator (Emma) says ""I'll make sure to call Mark to have the door code changed"". She 100% says. She doesn't say ""I'll make sure to call Mark and see if Simon changed his code"". No. She is calling Mark to make sure the door code is changed. She assumes that Simon is not reliable, because clearly the reader is also assuming that same thing.

Does she ever call Mark? Maybe somewhere it's written that she didn't and that didn't sink in and so I forgot? Because at the time I got reassured Simon couldn't be the one since the writer went out of his way to tell us he didn't have the code anymore.

This is dumb. This completely ruins the plot twist and the whole book for me. Of course it is ""surprising"", because at least I ruled out Simon purely because Emma clearly stated she was going to call Mark the next day. It's surprising because the writer went out of his way to reassure the reader out of that possibility, not because it's actually clever writing.

I actually feel somewhat insulted if I'm right about this. I don't get why the book has so much critical acclaim",0,1585443910,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqwrsx/the_girl_befores_plot_twist_is_extremely_dumb/,books,0

More importantly, why do you love it? Is there a trope that hooks you in every time, a character that you can't help but relate to, a setting that you eat up every time you can get a book set there?

Mine would be 'A Streetcat Named Bob', the memoir of a man who stopped using heroin, partly due to a cat that wouldn't leave him alone. It isn't terribly well-written, and not that action packed. Bob the street kitty isn't particularly heroic, and there are times where the author gets on my nerves a little. But I'm a sucker for cats, a sucker for redemption stories, and throughout the book there's this theme of the author ultimately getting everything that he needs. He's broke as hell, yet he has housing provided for him, gets medical care for Bob, manages to feed the both of them. Most importantly, the book discusses the author's isolation as a street person, and how people started paying attention once Bob started hanging out with him. It jerks at a ton of my heart strings.

fqv3iw,glenbricker,"""Actual"" magical realism vs ""Questionable"" magical realism *Spoilers for one very well known book*","Although ""magical realism"" is generally defined as having magical or fantastical elements and is a sub-genre of fantasy, there are numerous literary (and cinematic) examples where the story eventually reveals that the fantastic elements were actually mundane, indistinguishable from normal possibilities, or were the dreams or hallucinations of a single character. 

Life of Pi is a well known example of this bait and switch. 

While I can appreciate these stories I find it extremely frustrating to get to the end of story THEN be told I was being lied to the whole time. 

When I look these stories up I keep finding them in the ""Magical Realism"" category. 

So, here are the questions I have regarding Magical Realism:

Is it generally accepted that the genre of magical realism welcomes the inclusion of stories where nothing supernatural actually occurred?

Is there a term for these stories where the magical elements are questionable or proven mundane?

If Magical Realism welcomes the inclusion of stories where a single character's perceptions are in question, where is the line drawn? If a literary figure gets high then sees a talking unicorn, it is impossible for the reader to ACTUALLY know if the unicorn is a literary hallucination or if the talking unicorn is physically present and the observer happens to be high.

I realize I am unlikely to get any solid answers on this subject but I am curious about what people have to say on it.",5,1585437859,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqv3iw/actual_magical_realism_vs_questionable_magical/,books,2

I found myself identifying with Charlie a lot in the book, especially at different times in my life. Facing some of the uncomfortable truths that I too at stages in my life have been like Charlie's 'friends.' Not to the same extent, but I like most people have stood on the shoulders of others to make myself feel better without realizing I'm doing it. Never at the time understanding the consequences of my actions, until after the fact. This book made me want to cry at the beginning and the end, which is a first for me whilst reading. 

Added to this is the ability now as an adult to read about the struggles Charlie had with emotional detachment, and see myself as an adolescent and laugh as I look back at a younger me. At the same time I'm annoyed I was never given this book as a teen, to save myself the trouble of figuring it out for myself. Understanding now how natural it is for everyone to have these issues, as your intelligence (or perceived intelligence in my case) outstrips your emotional intelligence.

I am not bringing this up to crap on anyone’s taste. I went into reading this knowing full well what to expect after reading The Way of Kings. That is, I expected a silly fantasy novel that, despite its utilitarian and campy writing, would keep me entertained through it. It’s just that I have read a few reviews on goodreads that speak to how great he is at writing and how his work is the best contemporary fantasy literature around. I guess I just don’t see that. His writing feels a little cheap. It feels YA but mixed into an adult world. To me, it feels like it may have been edited just for syntax and not for content. The 1000+ page counts of these books feel a little unearned.

I haven’t read much modern fantasy and I’m wondering if this is the best we have around right now, aside from most of ‘The Song of Ice and Fire’ and what is available of “The Kingkiller Chronicles” 

Is anyone else in the same boat? Am I being hyper-critical?

The way King made another reality with such incredible details and made that reality my reality. I've never experienced such emotions from a book. I've been happy, reading the book, sad, angry, afraid, excited and erotic. I mean the two months I took to really read this book, I was absolutely absorbed, living the character's lives and I can't emphasize enough on how well this book is written.

I've marked my favourite parts throughout the book but the last few bits that really shattered me

Bill after the promise: ""And he sees them, really sees them, for the last time because in some way he understands that they will never all be together again, the seven of them, not this way""

Mike when he calls Richie: ""I believe we were both thinking the same thing, it was over, yes, and in six weeks or six months, we will have forgotten all about each other. It's over and all it's cost us is our friendship and Stan &amp; Eddies lives""

When Mike calls Bill: ""Mike, it's scary, isn't it? Forgetting like this?""
'Yes,' I said. And it is.

This beautiful thing they had between them, although staying a desire in each other's heart, but not as memories in their minds, had me flowing waterworks.

fqpem8,acqc2k19,Yall. How do I read more efficiently?,"Okay, so I’m a young reader (early teens) and I love reading. I’ve always loved reading of all sorts; to learn, for entertainment, for school. The problem is that I’m an extremely slow reader. Even if I’m interested in the book I’m reading. For reference, it takes me an estimated 6 DAYS to read a 350-400 page book, at a leisurely pace. If I’m really pressed to read it, 2-3 days. It might not seem that slow, but I have SO MANY books on my tbr. I know everyone reads at a different pace, but it’s really important for me to read quickly, efficiently, and retain the information that I’ve read. How do I achieve this??? I’m sorry if this all seemed kinda redundant, trivial, or repetitive, but I gotta solve this. Thank you if you respond.",15,1585419528,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqpem8/yall_how_do_i_read_more_efficiently/,books,0
fqp5ee,itbeginstoblur,"Did ""The Kite Runner"" fall flat for anyone else?","After how much I've heard about this book, I was kind of shocked to really not enjoy it. The story itself was predictable and the main plot points felt forced. Or even like they were just chosen for the sake of being emotional. The bully, for example, doesn't even have a character. It's like he's just thrown in as an instigator when the writer needs to move the story along. The commentary on race and class had so much less depth than it should have. Mainly, I found the prose itself super cliche and bland. Lots of paragraph and chapters end with some trite phrase like ""that was the night... everything changed.""

Anyone else have a similar experience? Comments from fans of the book are welcome too :) I may not have liked it, but I'd definitely be interested in hearing why others did. Hope everyone's quarantine reading is going well!

fqmxci,renny811,Why do people hate the end of “The Count Of Monte Cristo”?,"I’ve read the book about 4 times in the course of a year. Every time I read it, I learn something new that I didn’t realize before. As it pertains to the ending, I understood it to mean that Edmond finally got over Mercedes, and was willing to start a new, happy life with Haidee. 

What is wrong with that? I’ve seen several people complain and whine about how “it’s too unrealistic”. Oh really? I didn’t know we read fiction for its hyper-realism. Plus, this is a romantic novel, and these types of novels sometimes have good endings. I’ve also seen people who read the book and wished Edmond Dante’s kills himself or something, or ends up alone. Throughout my entire time reading it, the author makes it a point for the reader to empathize with Edmond and want him to succeed... and these people think the main character should kill himself? For what?  Or they say “but Mercedes didn’t get a happy ending!”; and to that I say, so? This story isn’t about her, and it’s not as though she is free from all blame either, she’s lucky worse things didn’t happen, like Edmond killing her son. 

I think a lot of people believe this books message is about how revenge is never worth it, and to some extent it is. But from the amount of times I read it, this book seems to be more about justice, and how some individuals escape the punishment that they deserve while others are unjustly punished in their stead. When you look at the book this way, there is no reason for the protagonist to end up alone or dead. He got what he wanted, and he succeeded. At the end, his mission is complete and he can start his new life. I see nothing wrong with that.",10,1585411520,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqmxci/why_do_people_hate_the_end_of_the_count_of_monte/,books,1
fqmx39,violet_beard,Inferno by Dan Brown - is it just me or is Brown a really bad writer?,"When I was younger, I LOVED both The Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons. I read The Lost Symbol about a year or so ago, and I only kinda liked it - but I started realizing that while the plot was really interesting, Brown’s writing style was, like... really not good.

Now I’m trying to read Inferno - holy crap, it’s so poorly written. Maybe I’m just realizing now something that’s always been there, but Dan Brown’s writing style is so clunky that it’s ruining the book for me. The fact that he interjects with another art history fact twice a page just pulls me out of the story so much that it’s actually disengaging. And his cringeworthy over-use of adjectives just gets silly at times. While I try not to be a pretentious reader and just enjoy a book for what it is, I can’t deny that I just want to call it quits and never read a Brown book again. I guess I’m writing this cause I’m curious if anyone else agrees or if I’m just an exception.

Work hard, effectively. Work towards your happiness, and what you do should provide happiness. As in end-in itself.  Knowing full well the entire time all that burden is yours to bear.

fqlopy,Keaton126,My Thoughts on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll,"\- I finished this classic yesterday on a warm, sunny day in Connecticut. I'm a man in my 30's, and I became sad that this adventure had come to an end so quickly. This was my first read-through of Alice, and I was surprised at how laugh-out-loud nonsensical the book truly was. I had seen some of the film adaptations, but they do not do Carroll justice. 

\- Quick summary: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, for those new to literature, is the story of a whimsical little girl (Alice) who is transported via rabbit hole to a world filled with anthropomorphic creatures living mad, even wild lives. Her interactions with them are brief, but truly lunatic. Her interactions with the Duchess, the Hatter, and Cheshire Cat particularly tickled me. And, I couldn't help but picture a goofy actor like Will Ferrell playing the King, especially in the final court scene. 

\- I really grew to love the character of Alice, and I think it will push me to immediately pick up Through The Looking Glass. Though merely a young girl, she is intuitive, inquisitive, courageous, and challenging in a world with combative caterpillars and a murderous Queen. She never backs down regardless of her ever-changing size, has sympathy for the meeker subjects of the land, and tolerates all levels of craziness with a cool head. She is a solid female lead character and I enjoyed following her travels. Obviously, the Hatter is a famous character, and I found the personalities of the Duchess, the Queen, the Cook (omg), and the Cat to be amusing as well, but I really think Alice herself carries the story. 

\- I feel as though you know a book is a classic in Children's Lit when an adult can enjoy it too. That's what Carroll has done here, creating an tale both child and adult will really adore. Buried in the illogical I found some great nuggets of wisdom as well. Amongst the many themes this book displays, I'd say the concept of change hit me the hardest. As I said, the size of Alice is constantly changing, as is her surroundings and the characters she meets. Yet, somehow, she also understands mentally she has changed as well. She repeats phrases like "" It's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then."" And, that I guess hits me as someone who realizes I am no longer in my own youth, and things are different now. Change, especially in an age of quarantines and self isolation, social distancing and pandemics- is real and unforgiving. I needed this. And, I would advise anyone too caught up in the real world, to pick this up and spend some time in Wonderland. We are all mad down here.

\- Quick aside, the illustrations done by the British artist John Tenniel are just as beautiful and worth seeing as the story is worth reading. Really well done. ALSO... I just began the audiobook read by the lovely Scarlett Johansson, and she has done a magnificent job as well.

Meanwhile, she mentions dating a writer right after DFW but doesn’t say his name. Why not? She mentions being assaulted “by one of the most famous writers in the country/ world” (I can’t remember which) but doesn’t give his name. But she also mentions a party where Charlie Rose was “skeeving around” (her words), instead of saying a “famous talk show host” or something like that. So what are the rules?

* महाराणा प्रताप की लंबाई 7’5 फीट थी. उनका वजन 110 किलोग्राम था. महाराणा प्रताप की तलवारबहुत ही वजन वाली थी.

* उसी जमाने के एक चारण कवि के अनुसार महाराणा प्रताप 2 तलवारें रखते थे | एक अपने लिए व दूसरी निहत्थे शत्रु के लिए |

*महाराणा प्रताप के भाला, कवच, ढाल और तलवार का कुल वजन 207 किलोग्राम था जिसमे 80 किलो वजन तो केवन भाले का था.

* युद्धभूमि में चेतक को मुगल हाथियों से भी मुकाबला करना पड़ता था, इसलिए हाथियों को भ्रमित करने लिए महाराणा प्रताप चेतक के मुख पर हाथी की नकली सूंड लगा दिया करते थे |


* महाराणा प्रताप और अकबर ने पूरे जीवन में कभी एक-दूसरे को नहीं देखा | कुछ किस्सों में बताया जाता है कि अकबर ने महाराणा प्रताप को देखा था या उनसे मिला था, पर ये सही नहीं है |

*सिर्फ 20000 सैनिक लेकर अकबर के 85000 सैनिको से महाराणा प्रताप ने युद्द लड़ा था.

अकबर ने कई बार अलग अलग तरह के लालच दिए लेकिन महाराणा प्रताप कभी भी झूके नही.

महाराणा प्रताप के हल्दी घाटी युद्द में प्रयोग की हुई तलवार, कवच उदयपुर राज घराने के मियुजियम में आज भी सुरक्षित रखी हुई हैं

* महाराणा प्रताप को बड़े पैमाने पर जन-सहयोग मिला | मेवाड़ की प्रजा उनका बहुत आदर करती थी |


* कविराज श्यामलदास के अनुसार महाराणा प्रताप अनुशासन के पक्के थे |


* महाराणा प्रताप बाल विवाह व सती प्रथा के खिलाफ थे | महाराणा प्रताप की किसी भी रानी के सती होने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं मिलता है |


* संघर्ष के दिनों में महाराणा प्रताप कई-कई दिनों तक अपने ज़िरह-बख्तर को पहने रखते थे | ये ज़िरह-बख्तर आज उदयपुर सिटी पैलेस में रखा हुआ है |


* महाराणा प्रताप जैन आचार्यों का भी बहुत सम्मान करते थे | जब तपागच्छ के पट्टधर का उदयपुर आना हुआ, तो महाराणा प्रताप उनकी आगवानी के लिए तेलियों की सराय (वर्तमान में बी.एन. कॉलेज) तक पधारे थे |


* अकबर के दरबारी कवि दुरसा आढ़ा की नजर में घोर अंधकार से परिपूर्ण अकबर के शासन में जब सब राजा ऊँघने लग गए किन्तु जगत का दाता राणा प्रताप पहरे पर जाग रहा था | राणा प्रताप के प्रण, पराक्रम व पुरुषार्थ पर मुग्ध कवि ने लिखा -


अकबर घोर अंधार, उंघाणा हींदू अवर |

जागै जगदातार, पोहरै राणा प्रतापसी ||


* महाराणा प्रताप के बारे में वीरविनोद के लेखक कविराज श्यामलदास लिखते हैं ""इन महाराणा का जीवन ज़िरहबख्तर पहिने हुए व तलवार हाथ में लिए बड़े ही बहादुराना बर्ताव के साथ गुजरा""


* चावण्ड में मिले साक्ष्यों से पता चलता है कि महाराणा प्रताप वास्तुशास्त्र में भी विश्वास रखते थे |


* महाराणा प्रताप की धर्मनिरपेक्षता का पता इस बात से चलता है कि उनकी फौज में हकीम खान सूरी भी थे और महाराणा के समय चावण्ड चित्रशैली प्रसिद्ध हुई, जिसमें प्रमुख चित्रकार नसीरुद्दीन थे, जिनकी ""रागमाला"" बड़ी प्रसिद्ध है |


* आत्म प्रशंसा में लिखने के नाम पर महाराणा प्रताप ने अपने पास कुछ नहीं माना अन्यथा उनके दरबार में भी काेई अबुल फज़ल और फैजी होता | याद नहीं कि महाराणा ने अपनी प्रशंसा में काेई

ग्रंथ लिखवाया हो | उनके जीवनकाल में प्रशंसा की कोई पुष्पिका तक नहीं मिलती, हां चक्रपाणि मिश्र ने जरूर एकाध श्लोक महाराणा प्रताप की प्रशंसा में लिखा |

महाराणा प्रताप के समय विद्वान चक्रपाणि मिश्र ने कुछ ग्रन्थ लिखे, जिनमें से कुछ इस तरह हैं -

१) विश्व वल्लभ

२) राज्याभिषेक पद्धति

३) मुहुर्तमाला

४) व्यवहारादर्श


* महाराणा प्रताप अकबर को ना तो बादशाह कहते थे और ना उसका नाम लेते | वे अकबर को सदैव ""तुर्क"" कहा करते थे |

fqgo37,tejas299,Advice for self-started book club,"So my friends and I started a book club. We decided to meet weekly and plan on reading \~200 pages/week. We've already set the weekly meeting time, and have established a system for selecting books. Considering the fact that none of us read on a regular basis and that we're not very disciplined (it's a group of seven 21 yr old boys so you can imagine), what is the best way of ensuring that this goes well? For further context, this won't be easy for me personally but I can convince myself to stick to it if everyone else does as well. I'm one of the more responsible ones though and I'm unsure about some of the others' dedication levels. I'm thinking 200 pages might be too much, but at the same time I want to get as much out of this as possible.

His pacing, storytelling, and character building is nearly flawless. I loved the journey this book took me through. The Venice setting, entire plot set up and characters were totally enthralling.

fqe6j2,E1994Z,Any Suggestions? I'm An Author Seeking Advice,"Good morning, Reddit!

As an author on Kindle, I'm trying to get insight and suggestions on what types of books are popular or readers want more of. More horror, less fantasy? Or less sci-fi, more romance? I know this tends to change every few months, but what holds it's popularity?

I've been publishing short stories, guides and self-help but haven't published a novel and I'm kind of getting discouraged about it. Everytime I give my story ideas, I'm always shot down with people saying ""how stupid is that idea?"" or ""stick to your day job"". It hurts, you know?

Ever since I was a kid, I believe I was given a gift of writing and family members believe so too. I would really like to make a book and get people to say ""wow"". Maybe if it got so popular, an author meet and greet would be an option? Possibly a movie?

Also, do readers like or dislike heavy language and disturbing themes. I have some ideas but they may be too dark for some and don't want a bad reputation.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just desperate to find answers. If anyone can help me out, that'll be great!

Your cats nestle close to their humans,  
You have TV and laptop and phone.  
You’re cozy and warm on your couch, my dear.

The shops are all dark in the town, child.  
It's quiet as a catacomb.  
You can order things from Amazon if you swear  
You’ll stay the f\*\*k at home.

The planes who soar through the sky are at rest,  
No one sells fancy coffee with foam.  
Your job's not essential. That’s bulls\*\*t. Stop lying.  
Stay the f\*\*k, my darling, at home.

The freeways and streets are deserted.  
The beaches and parks you can't roam.  
It’s only been a few weeks at the most.  
Jesus Christ, what the f\*\*k? Stay at home.

All the students remote learn in homeschool.  
The concerts and sports are postponed.  
Hell no, you can’t go to the mall.  
You know where you can go? NOWHERE. Stay home!

The stores are all ransacked an pillaged.

You can drink and watch p\*rn and get stoned.

They'd fill up the whole SuperDome.  
No more screwing around. This isn't hoax.

So what if your roots started showing?  
You've abandoned your razor and comb.  
F\*\*k your nail appointment, we all look like s\*\*t.  
Just stay put. Cut the crap and stay home.

We wave at our newly-met neighbors,  
From a safe social distancing zone.  
You want to hang out but it's not worth the risk.  
So we stay safe and sound, at home

You don't know what risks I am facing.  
Like an autoimmune syndrome.  
My life's in your hands, I'm don't want to get sick.  
Stop f\*\*king with me, please, stay home.

But some of you still party hearty,  
As health workers wail and moan.  
Sure, fine, whatever... Infect each other.  
Who the f\*\*k cares? But I'm staying at home.

Bleary and dazed we awaken  
From a nightmare into the unknown.  
My fingers crossed tight as I peek out my door  
And pray that you’re still f\*\*king home.

Soon we'll all be over this virus.  
We will no longer hide out alone.  
We will defeat Corona but ONLY if all of you

fqbywh,tiltowaitt,What am I supposed to feel when reading horror books?,"I've debated off and on over the past year or so about posting this, because of its potential for coming across as stupid boasting. But an earlier post about *The Haunting of Hill House* brought the topic to mind again, and ... why not?

The answer to my question might seem obvious: I should feel scared! Only, I don't. A year ago, I realized that I had almost no exposure to the horror genre, so I set out to rectify that. I read most of Lovecraft's stories, *'Salem's Lot*, *Pet Sematary*, *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*, *I Am Legend* (not sure this one actually counts as horror, but it often shows up in such lists), *Ararat*, *Who Goes There?* (aka *The Thing*), *The Shining*, *Doctor Sleep*, *Hell House*, *The Haunting of Hill House*, *Bird Box*, and a few others I'm forgetting.

None of these books or stories inspired fear or dread. They never kept me awake at night, I didn't have to read with all the lights on, I didn't have to force myself to turn the page, etc. They were, simply put, all of varying levels of entertaining, from ""meh"" to ""fun"". ""The Whisperer in Darkness"" got an ""Ohhhh, neat"" reaction from me. The end of *Pet Sematary* got a sigh.

I'm not sure why none of them affected me in any real way. Did I inadvertently read lightweight stuff? Am I just a robot? Is the overall predictability of the genre keeping me from getting invested? Am I just unable to connect with the story and characters in the intended way? What do *you* feel when reading horror? What do you think the author wants you to feel?

(In case anyone asks: horror movies very rarely frighten me. Video games manage it the most, but not very often.)",11,1585364208,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqbywh/what_am_i_supposed_to_feel_when_reading_horror/,books,1

fqayhh,ankit_dey,"A moment ago, I finished reading ""The Nightingale"" by Kristin Hannah, and I feel as if a war has come to an end inside me.","The book is still by my bedside. My hands and feet are shivering a bit for that I've stayed awake since last night to finish this book.

Many thanks to redditors all over r/booksuggestions and r/suggestmeabook to suggest me this book multiple times when I seeked for a book on historical fiction.To those who haven't read this, but have it in their TBRs, I suggest you stop reading here. 

It is crushing. Absolutely heart-wrenching. This book made me realise all over again, that we can never ever comprehend historical events as massive as The Second World War in its entirety.

Over the past few years, multiple books on historical fiction, WWII even more so came up, every now and then. Yet I do not seem to remember any book through two women's perspectives. *The Diary of a Young Girl* some might suggest; yes, but it was through the eyes of a teenage girl who is growing up to be a woman. Also, it is non-fiction. *The Book Thief*, others might say. Again, she was a teenage girl.

Another beauty I found in this book was its narrative style. It began with a first-hand narrative of one of the two sisters (anyone can guess that from the blurb). Intermittently, throughout the book, the narrative shifted back from the *third-person past* narrative to *first-person present* narrative. It wouldn't be until the last chapter, that it is revealed, which sister are we talking to.

As my fellow book reading redditors have done, I shall follow suit and pass on the word to every enthusiast of historical fiction to pick up *The Nightingale*, for it will break you, the way the world broke down around the two sisters.

Happy reading!",12,1585360315,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fqayhh/a_moment_ago_i_finished_reading_the_nightingale/,books,1

fq0rqu,frocsog,Journey by Moonlight by Antal Szerb,"Hi,

This is one of my favourite books, but it's rarely mentioned in anywhere except here, in Hungary. You can read [this review from 2014](https://newrepublic.com/article/119730/antal-szerbs-journey-moonlight-review) by Becca Rothfeld, in which she calls it a ""forgetten masterpiece"", but let me share my thoughts with you about what makes this book special and worth a read for anyone.

Have you ever felt, when reaching an important point or achievement in your life which should make you happy according to anyone, that you're lost, and want to just disappear? That you aren't living your life as you once wanted to, and feeling a need to desperately bring back the glorious days of your youth?

This book is about someone who can't really fit into a normal, conformist life, but can't really live in the world of ideas either. Instead, he lives somewhere in his past. People live in him he hasn't met in years but they haunt him with dissatisfaction and nostalgia. It's about a continous escape, from himself.

There is mystery, spirituality, humour and an eccentric academic in it who talks passionately about the ancient Etrusks and lives on smoked ham and tea, a doctor who believes in ghosts, a converted Catholic Jewish priest, a Persian who smokes opium and the protagonist is obsessed with death. I mean, what more can you ask for in a novel?

Oh, and it's a pretty good tourist guide on the beauty of Italy, so if you can't go there because, you know, there are really good descriptions on not exactly on the sights, but on the mood of Italy. It's the fascist Italy in the '40s but you won't relly notice.

I strongly suggest this as the author has a unique style that I haven't found since.  It's a shame the nazis killed him.",1,1585328619,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fq0rqu/journey_by_moonlight_by_antal_szerb/,books,2

fpzr5x,thankyouforfu,"The Best Science Fiction Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last Decade, Part 2 (2010-2014)","Hey book readers, I'm back with a new list in addition to my recent post covering the last 5 years:



[The Best SCIENCE FICTION Books, SciFi Novels, and SFF Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)](https://old.reddit.com/r/printSF/comments/fcrfon/the_best_science_fiction_books_scifi_novels_and/) 



Thus, this expands the total ""Best Of"" to the last ten years, encompassing 2010-2019 (i.e. the list below is for 2010 through 2014, and the link above is for 2015-2019).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


You can also check out my post on [The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)](https://old.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/f7879h/the_best_horror_books_novels_and_stories_of_the/)

...and the follow up [The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Past Decade (2010-2014)](https://old.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/fkys4q/the_best_horror_books_novels_and_stories_of_the/)




-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



It's nice to have one simple location in which to find science fiction / SFF recommendations rather than having to browse a ton of difference posts and sites, so I have created one based on what I've found to be considered **AWARD-WORTHY SCI-FI NOVELS**. 

*Essentially, these are the SciFi stories that were nominated for and/or won SFF awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*


Occasionally one of the books on this list leans more towards fantasy than sci-fi, but I'd rather include it and let the reader decide if that's something they are interested in than omit it outright.

One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp

For the above site, you should be eyeing these major SF awards:

- The Hugo Award

- The Nebula Award

- The Locus Science Fiction Award

- The Arthur C. Clarke Award

...amongst others.


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&amp;awyr=2019

Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for SciFi, so I have taken as many SF novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).

https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-science-fiction-books-2019

I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything, such as:

https://best-sci-fi-books.com/21-best-science-fiction-books-of-2019/


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**NOTE:** If there is an obvious omission, please let me know in the comments. This is a work in progress.

Just as a heads up, the books are pretty much in order by Hugo award nominees, Nebula award nominees, Locus award nominees, Clarke award nominees, Goodreads award nominees, then filled in with books found off ""Best Of"" lists.

fpz86v,Keelys_Damian,Revised: The case against Brandon Sanderson,"Between here and r/Fantasy I've seen an overwhelming amount of praise thrown Mr. Sanderson's way, and while I've only read the first Mistborn trilogy (my roommate, cringing at my apparent ignorance when he read the previous draft through, told me the appropriate term: *Era 1*), Elantris, Warbreaker, and the opening chapters of Way of Kings -- please, it's all just *so long --* I feel like I've seen enough of his [theory](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/) in practice to know it doesn't work.

I'll open with this: fantasy stories, despite what they appear to be on the surface, are *not* about elves, dwarfs, dragons, and wizards. Lots of people would like to think that they are because it makes the whole genre a lot easier to categorize and, if that's your thing, easier to denigrate. You hear it all the time: if a person likes *Harry Potter* it's because they're unsatisfied with their current reality and would like to escape to one a little more magical; but of course, as [Moorcock teaches us](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/en361fantastika/bibliography/2.7moorcock_m.1978epic_pooh.pdf), the very best stories are not the ones which alienate ourselves from our problems, but the ones which give us another perspective with which to combat them -- in short the stories which *connect* us to the world, which make us more empathetic and sincere; more *human*. Naturally, you could like fantasy for simply displaying these elements (honestly, so many books nowadays allow us to just 'switch off' our brains and watch them pass by) in a similar way you could read *Ulysses* or *Grapes of Wrath* and enjoy nothing more than the simple tale of a man walking around in Dublin or the tribulations of a struggling American family amid the Depression, but **that doesn't somehow mean the symbols aren't there**.

So if Fafnir, or Smaug, or Yevaud of Pendor, or \[insert the archetypal Western dragon of choice\], aren't merely wily, reptilian, firebreathing thieves then what are they? Well, fantasy is a bit like your lit professor's favourite Gothic novel, where the crumbling mansion or thunderstorm represents the inner toil of the main character, except here it's taken up to eleven. The dragon sits on a pile of gold so obviously it represents greed, or the elves hide out in the woods and run around naked under moonlight because they represent the purity of man before industrialization, or the triumph of the gods over the giants represents the triumph of civilization over nature, &amp;c. &amp;c. All writing consists of symbols and themes; whether the author is conscious of it or not, the way we were raised influences the way we see the world and that bleeds into our art. The best writers are able to recognize this and focus on developing a coherent philosophy which ties into their storytelling.

And magic is no different -- a symbol. But perhaps unlike all the others, the mold is not set. The skilled author can choose which way they want their magic to bend, and what ideas they want it to explore. If your story is about the return to innocence then how about opening your story in a world of decadence and immorality where all the notable magical authorities seem to think their world is dying but in reality the magic only works by telling the truth, or helping others? Just a thought. The leading writers in the genre have been doing this for years -- Moorcock took it even deeper by tying the magic to his characters. Your protagonist is sickly and weak? Throw him a sword that strengthens him with the souls of those it slays, but give it an appetite for his loved ones. Hell, in Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell one wizard refuses to even research a whole branch of magic and one of the reasons is that the spells would be at odds with Regency-era morality:

&gt;Not all these sorts of magic will suit us nowadays. Shape-changing and so on were all very well in the past. It makes a vivid incident in a story, I grant you. But surely, Strange, you would not want to practise it? A gentleman cannot change his shape. A gentleman scorns to seem any thing other than what he is. You yourself would never wish to appear in the character of a pastry-cook or a lamplighter.

This fact, that magic lies in the *ideas* it wants to explore and not in how consistently its used, is what I often cite when someone asks about the Eagles in *Fellowship*. Simply put, they aren't used because Tolkien was trying to tell a story about the process of growing up -- it's one of the reasons the Hobbits are so small, why Gandalf is the wandering old man (I know it's also because he's heavily inspired by Wotan), and why Frodo goes to heaven at the end -- and that process is symbolically represented by the journey. If the Fellowship could just hop on the back of a massive Eagle and aerially drop the ring into Mount Doom that, sure, would be more *practical*, but at the cost of the philosophy Tolkien was trying to get across. [But don't just take my word for it](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2327.The_Letters_of_J_R_R_Tolkien):

&gt;The Eagles are a dangerous 'machine'. I have used them sparingly, and that is the absolute limit of their credibility or usefulness.

And for the most part, the same seems to be true for Howard, Harrison, Anderson, and most of the other authors often accused of employing soft magic. The argument 'soft magic is bad because it allows the author to solve their conflicts immediately without any setup' i.e. god from the machine is nonsense, because a good author would never do that. Conflict isn't introduced into the story in order to give the protagonist something to do for a while or to increase the page count, it's there to explore themes, characters, the world, &amp;c. It's there on purpose, with an aim in mind -- to discuss concepts and thoughts through the narrative. Wand-waving the problem away would only serve to undermine its inclusion in the first place -- the conclusion should make contextual sense.

Despite speaking a lot about magic systems, Sanderson almost always falls prey to the very things he warns us about -- I remember one scene in Elantris when the hero, who due to an unresolved plot point from earlier, adapts a spell which hastily solves nearly all the problems he had been trying to fix for the entire book. He does it again in the second Mistborn when the protagonist uses an aforementioned ability to control the emotions of others to just no-sell an entire army of indestructible monsters that had been built up from the first novel. Sanderson seems to think that the author's ability  to solve a given conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands it -- his words. But for me, it's always more satisfying to see the writer come up with new and imaginative ways of getting the mission done. *The King of Elfland's Daughter* by Lord Dunsany, which is notorious for kickstarting the whole soft magic thing in modern fantasy does this really well without once explaining how the magic works: it's treated as so much a part of the world that it already has a much deeper, internal logic. And that's really what we should be worried about: not if the magic is used consistently or not, but rather if the ideas and concepts it represents are reliable and coherent, because if they are **then the magic doesn't need explicit rules**. Good magic is confined, so therefore *defined*, by far deeper rules: the rules of storytelling.

As we can see however, Sandersonian magic is little more than a one-for-one substitute for technology, where things like bombs and air-travel are exchanged for magical processes. And as far as I can tell, it's all because he isn't actually interested in thinking about a world different from our own; he wants to write fantasy because it's fun, ignoring the myth and historical context because it interferes with his cartoonish wish-fulfillment. The symptoms are everywhere: colloquialisms like 'spunk' get thrown around, along with jokes about dividing by zero. Characters have modern notions of relationships, mental illness, and society; they even think in the same logical patterns as us. Sanderson gives us a medieval setting, because that's basically all fantasy is about anyway, only to subvert it at the end, because subversion is the newest, cleverest trick in the bag, but he never really bothers to *show* us how the inclusion of magic in a world's history would make it different from ours. And no, I'm not talking about [changing the rules of racism to being based on eye colour instead](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism).

It's been suggested that his writing gets better in his more recent stuff, but I've never heard a concrete answer to whether any of my aforementioned problems ever get addressed. Sanderson's magic, despite what it claims to be, is no more than a hack, a cheat-code to lazy storytelling. How did the wizard defeat the unbeatable troll-army? [The same spells they've been using the entire time, except bigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPwVuC3YOrc). His 'systems' are always either an arbitrary set of comic-book powers (with enough weaknesses that there are stakes) or a 'victory cheque' which his hero cashes in at the end to win (See: [The Well-Tempered Plot Device](https://news.ansible.uk/plotdev.html)). We are never invited to question if his heroes are actually good people or what they truly want for themselves because they're constantly faced with world-ending threats. He's avoiding all the hard parts of writing -- characterization, nuanced plotting -- and covering up his deficiencies with magic. But hey, it's convenient and it works, like taking the lift instead of the stairs, and like taking the lift all the time, it eventually weakens you.

As such, I almost never find myself asking if the magic being used in these books is consistent with the rules the author outlined beforehand (because I'm not playing Skyrim or League where the magic *needs* to be predictable and each spell has to have a measurable effect on an enemy's HP) but nearly every time I crack open a Sanderson novel I'm wondering if the underpinning philosophy is consistent -- how his magic ties to his world, his characters, his tonal arcs, and exactly what melody each of these individual elements are strung together to create. Alas, the more I wonder, the more I am frustrated. The more I am reminded of this quote by Kafka:

&gt;*A characteristic movement in such a condition is to run your little finger along your eyebrows.*

# Before you comment

As always, I welcome differing thoughts and opinions -- it is, after all, what learning consists of. Here's a bunch of things I hear often enough to point out:

* *OP is presenting their opinion as fact.* 

Unfortunately, I no longer know how to write without doing this, because either I point it out and I'm 'hiding behind' it, or I don't and I'm being imperious. 

* *This was too long and I didn't read it.*

Yeah, unimpressive. I [tried](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/fotdlj/the_case_against_brandon_sanderson/) making it shorter.

* *The given examples are nitpicky and biased.*

A sort of combination of the previous two.

* *This is a rant. You're not as smart as you think you are. So many people like his books, are they all wrong? Why can't you just like what you like and shut up about it? Your attempts to use other historical works to contextualize your 'critique' is elitist and gatekeeping. Sanderson is not for you. This was condescending and insulting.*

As to that, my vain spirit has so far served to shield me from my many vices.",58,1585324089,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpz86v/revised_the_case_against_brandon_sanderson/,books,0

fpxzbf,DeadComedy,What is one genre you love about books.,"I like history here is why, (I made a poem)  

Friday:

Favorite Friday: “What Is Your favorite book genre, and why?”-- Well, all books are great. But for me, I’m the type of guy who likes to read historical books, like ones with facts and everything. They are interesting because they make me think. They kinda go through whatever historical event is happening and list you some details, and I learn loads of information from those books.

Nonfiction is a good and deep reading genre. It gives you information while somewhat entertaining you. It fascinates you with reality, and what could come. While you read Nonfiction it sort-of makes your brain flow better and you gain a deeper understanding of what you actually learned. Then once you learn this you can make reality seem somewhat much simpler. After you have this change of information in your brain, you can start to break it down, and connect the dots. And finally, you discovered something new.

Whilst you read nonfiction, the factual state in your brain changes. It’s like you are floating in a whole new world of what you are reading. You learn all of those phenomenal pieces of information that you are willing to teach to our next generation, or someone unaware of what you learned. May you go on out and search for more details on this strange life. Where your brain is filled with common sense and then you realize what information you have actually stored in your brain. And a quintillion more questions may nest in your brain. Which makes you want to read more of these books.

Once you learn the overpowered information you learned in these books. You start to think “What should I do next.” And then you think of spreading joy to your world! And then you help all the curious children as they ask more questions and start the same cycle of learning that you did before. After all this knowledge has been shared we can explore all around us even outside the world. Because all the words in the entire world would never and not even get close to be able to say how wonderful this life actually is. So for those who are curious come right up, we’ll fascinate you with all the facts in the world. As we seek more information, we start to think about why was this world created, as there are many other universes other than the milky way. All this information we might learn in a day a week or a century you think, well I think no, I think if this whole world learns they will be able to shorten the amount of time colossally.

Well, let us hope this is you let us hope that all our lives dreams can be made by our world. Let’s stop waiting and let’s get to learning. As we don’t have enough time so let’s get moving. Let us beings achieve our goals, and change this world permanently without being cruel.",4,1585319788,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpxzbf/what_is_one_genre_you_love_about_books/,books,1

The author tried to avoid repeating the same words, so he was replacing them with irrelevant synonyms/awkward and obscure references to other people (e.g. England -&gt; James Bond's country) or  redundant details presented in previous chapters. Also he visibly divided sections of the story by saying things like ""And now onto the next chapter... "" etc instead of keeping the story going without telling the obvious, it resembled some school assignment. Also it was unnecessarily subjective, for example when describing artist's work he imposed a certain opinion about this work, which I think was a little unfair.

If the topic came up before, I'm sorry. Anyway, I'm waiting for your recommendations, thanks.",1,1585313917,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpwhrf/what_are_the_best_biographies_youve_read_and_what/,books,1

- The Handmaid’s Tale and Mrs Dalloway (momentous works by pioneering female authors?) 
- Heart of Darkness and Coetzee’s Disgrace - will Conrad’s 20th Century Fame continue and comfortably outstrip the potential renown of Coetzee’s literature in general?

While on page 50 16.39% of Count Zero W. Gibson's sequel to the Neuromancer.

Cyberpunk is often called dystopian but actually, it isn't, tech and capitalism have advanced, and it describes the grittier walks of life.  
Real-life under Covid-19 quarantine atm is more dystopian, but that too isn't really dystopian, we're just doing what we have to without a cure/vaccine.  
Dystopian worlds have often started with a catastrophe, like war or indeed, a pandemic, upon which the gov takes drastic action but then takes advantage of the situation, and let's say strict quarantine measures, are still in effect hundreds of years after the catastrophe for no reason but to tyrannize and exploit the population.  
I doubt reality will turn out that way, the people are complicit now cuz it's the right thing to do, but once the body count goes down restrictions need to relax.",2,1585309437,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpvik4/some_thoughts_on_cyberpunk_and_dystopian_fiction/,books,1

fpuj95,MinorNPC,The Dreamers by Karen Thompson Walker feels way too fitting right now,"I was a bit apprehensive starting this book because of the number of reviews calling it a let-down. However, the plot really resonated with me, especially since we're fighting a pandemic right now.

The book is about a strange illness that causes its victims to fall into a deep slumber from which they cannot be awoken. It's incredibly contagious, and the story follows different characters in this town, their lives, and how it's all suddenly overturned. 

Some of the criticisms people have about this book is that the writing doesn't feel urgent enough, doesn't do justice to the theme it is dealing with. Another thing that people didn't like was that the ending didn't really provide answers.

Now, normally I would agree with them. However, reading this book while on lockdown, I felt a certain empathy for all the characters. From hoarders to conspiracy theorists to people trying to escape being quarantined, their actions held more meaning for me than usual.  As for the ending, while I normally enjoy closure, I was okay with this one - again, it felt apt. I enjoyed the writing style, the pacing, and the story. 

I'd recommend it, now more than ever.",2,1585304348,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpuj95/the_dreamers_by_karen_thompson_walker_feels_way/,books,1

A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

“The Haunting of Hill House” is acclaimed as one of the best haunted house stories of all time, and while that’s not exactly the aspect of the book that I enjoyed the most, it certainly deserves the title. If the reader isn’t scared by a “who’s hand was I holding?”, then there’s the impact; the stomach-turning dread caused by the tragedy that is its main character.

Horror isn’t commonly considered a highbrow genre, and I honestly feel as if the work’s absolute literary genius has been snubbed because of it. Every sentence that Jackson cranked out felt intentional; every action meaningful. There is genuinely so much to analyze and, in turn, so much more to appreciate. 

It’s a relatively short read and I believe there are some easily accessible, cheap copies of it online (if you’re into that kind of thing during a quarantine)!",173,1585291216,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fps7sd/just_finished_reading_shirley_jacksons_the/,books,1

In the first couple of pages of volume three Tolstoy talks about how historians attribute wars to specific causes. He argues that they are wrong in doing this because when you think about the scale of war, all the death and destruction it causes, no single cause can account for it. He then says that wars are not caused by a single or handful of causes, but by billions and billions of disparate circumstances coming together to create an event like war(basically determinism). Here is where my question lies, in the book Tolstoy says that men have two separate lives; a personal life where they can exercise free will, and a societal life where the events of history act upon them in a predetermined way. I don’t understand how Tolstoy could think that individuals have free will when he clearly seems to believe in historical fatalism, to me it seems like a contradiction.

fprgij,ShabnamSingla,How to stop viewing reading as a 'task'?,"I've been recently trying to build a habit of reading regularly. Earlier I thought I just couldn't concentrate or maybe I don't like to read. But I'm realising that I actually really like certain kinds of short stories (philosophical stuff mostly, poetic slow plots with not many characters, etc.). When I do get recommendations, either I get overwhelmed by the number (I start finding almost everything interesting) or I keep doing atleast 10 pages per day routine which makes me feel as if I'm reading just for the sake of completing the book. I love reading (fiction/non fiction) things when it's in the reading list at my uni (Philosophy major) or listed my prof or something and I love writing short summaries at the end. 

I'm just confused if I'm taking reading as some assignment because I'm not able to sit and read by myself if I know I don't have to submit anything related to it. And even if I do pick a book, I end up getting excited by something else and lose out on motivation to complete the previous one. Patience might help but I'm not sure how to go about it.

I know this was originally a series of separate books that were eventually bound, but from what I was able to gather, the general consensus is that the bind-ups are the superior versions. But since there's also more than one version of that, I never know if I should read the bind-up of the four original books or the bind-up of five that includes The Book of Merlyn. Or maybe I should read the the original four as one with TBoM as a companion novel? I've seen differing opinions on this, so I can never decide. From what I understand, in the bind-ups, White edits the earlier novels so that there is a clear theme throughout, but I don't really know if that theme changes at all in the bound 4 and bound 5.

Was I prepared for something like this? It actually drove me to start preparing for small scale local disasters which has been immensely helpful this month.

I’m interested if anyone else enjoyed this series and had any thoughts on how realistic the scenario seemed. My favorite part of all the books is when they are trying to figure out how to hold a national election when there's no electronic communications to coordinate.

I followed this one up with The Last Policeman by Ben H Winters. Another disaster series where there is an asteroid that will destroy Earth and the protagonist is faced with the decision of whether or not it is worth it to still investigate a crime.",0,1585276748,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpp4d2/the_current_global_situation_reminds_me_of/,books,1

I watched little women all the time when i was a kid, read the abridged version, saw the greta gerwig film, and played aunt march in a play for background. After reading the full book though i found the films lacking in many points i felt very important to each character. i know the film can’t get everything because of how long the book is (i personally think that someone should make a tv show with a chapter per episode) but i feel as though characters are always so oversimplified. Meg is usually portrayed as generally good though sometimes envious but in the book she’s very vain and materialistic(let’s also not forget when she’s mean to john for a power trip). Jo is strong, unconventional, and boyish but she’s also motherly and gentle. I feel like adaptions feel the need to take out the gentle parts of Jo because they think it makes her appear weaker than they want her to be. i think Beth is generally represented well. And that leaves Amy, I love Amy and in many adaptations she’s supposed to be materialistic and annoying but in the book she has these great moments of being kind, likable, and practical. I really like the way gerwig portrayed Amy because she’s such a good character. Anyway am i the only one who feels that adaptations take out bits of the characters that should be left in? now that the 4 girls are so popular everyone has the image of how they are but when i read the book i was pleasantly surprised at how developed they all are. please feel free to agree or disagree with me, i’m no literature major and these are just my fresh opinions. :)",8,1585276732,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpp480/i_just_finished_little_women/,books,1

fpo2d7,storyghost,The troubling thing about book bloggers,"I’ve been trying to find people I like on the internet who write, or  even vlog on YouTube, about books, and I’ve noticed some definite trends. It seems that in order to write about books on the internet, you must:

1. Collect plastic “Funko POP!” toys representing characters from your favorite film franchises and/or Harry Potter wands. (These “Funko POP!” toys are like simplified bobble-head dolls, without the bobbling. I would see the appeal better if they bobbled.)

2. Put your books in an Ikea Råskog utility cart (you know, that popular metal rolling storage unit with three bins that comes in different colors).

3. Take aesthetic flat-lay photos of your books on your rumpled bedspread, sometimes incorporating a floral arrangement, pastry on a pretty plate, cup of coffee, a cat if you’re lucky–and don’t forget to apply a heavy photo filter! This part seems critical. We’re going for atmosphere, for *mood*.

4. And finally, buy all your books, and new from the bookstore, at that. Not only new books, but brand-spanking new *publications* are preferred, and for some reason weighted in favor of the YA-genre. What’s wrong with my social media feeds? I never see battered old library books, or vintage covers, except on Reddit (r/books,  r/bookcoverporn, r/bookporn, r/vintage…)

I just want to hear from a reader who’s older–or at least, who  eventually grew out of their Harry Potter obsession, like I did. Who’s a broke-ass minimalist, like I am, and not into collectibles. Who’s into non-new books. And library books.

If they’re a vlogger, then somebody ugly, please, or at least a girl who hasn’t just gotten a blowout and a manicure (a fresh manicure is apparently an absolute must, in photographs shared over social  media)–somebody with funny speech patterns, maybe, or a particularly  strong foreign or regional accent–or who uses colorful language–maybe even someone temperamental, genuine and unscripted, who rants and raves  about the good and the bad. About everything the author’s doing wrong.

If they loved it, I want them to read me their favorite passages from the book. If they hated it–the passages that made them want to burn the book til it was a pile of ash.

I want to see their interesting older editions, jam-stained, foxed and dog-eared. And I want them to be reading damn hard books, old books, real challenges; and not just that, but obscure books, forgotten translations, out-of-prints, rarities–books I’d have to really hunt down, not those shiny-and-new things strategically placed on the featured new-release shelves of Barnes &amp; Noble. Those aren’t gems, they’re just commodities. Merchandise. They have no character, no history, these pristine copies identical to the ones stacked behind  them. There’s nothing uglier than five replicas of the exact same thing, all crammed together in a line, a printed price sticker on each one. That’s, like, social dystopia. I want post-apocalyptic.

The price should be scrawled in pencil, on the inner front cover or first page. Somebody had to hold that copy in their hand and *decide* it.

And I want to hear about where the book blogger found the damn thing. And I mean really *found* it.

Like, I found my copy of “Crime and Punishment” on the street. My God, you should see the condition of this thing. It’s beautiful. The perfect balance between completely trashed and sturdily intact. It *literally* looked like somebody had stabbed a knife right through its front cover. It looks like it’s been read a million times. That’s how I knew it would be good. It seemed like fate, that tear in its cover. I’d never read “Crime and Punishment” before; boy, did it take me for a ride. Now I wouldn’t trade that particular book of mine for a million dollars. I want to hear about somebody’s own “Crime and Punishment”. 

Somebody left this book in my laundry basket at the coin-op. I stole this book out of an unlocked car. It was lying on a park bench. When I returned to the bar from the bathroom, it was placed next to my drink, no one else around, “READ THIS” scribbled on a napkin. I found it in my bag of groceries. I won it in a game of dice. It came packed with my unrelated eBay purchase. Someone threw it over a fence into my front  yard. A stranger put it in my pocket on a crowded train. A stray dog brought it to me.

*That’s* the kind of thing we should be telling each other about. The whole experience. Tell me something unique! *This* is the magic of books, for me. The old, forgotten, discarded–can be  something entirely new. You don’t have to have anything extra. No collectible dolls, no shiny nail polish, no cool Ikea furniture–you can be living in a cardboard box. The printed book, the copy, the physical  thing as much as the story, the writing, has plenty enough to say. You have an *experience* with it, unique and meritorious on its own. The book is an inherently fascinating object, and its virtues–or its aggravating qualities–should take you on a journey, whether to paradise or hell. It doesn’t need an Instagram filter!

fpny5t,afpow09,Do authors find it easier to write about characters who are wealthy?,"So I've been choosing more of the popular YA books to read lately. Mostly books that are available for e-book download from my library. The ones I've read most recently all have one thing in common, rich main characters. Some examples include Crazy Rich Asians, Where'd You Go, Bernadette, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and Get a Life, Chloe Brown. 

I guess it's easier to write on wealthy characters because they have everything they could possibly want (besides like love or a happy life lol). They aren't restricted in terms of materialism or traveling I guess. But it's just something I've noticed that makes it difficult to relate to these characters. I absolutely love the stories but it's ultimately unrealistic for me. I constantly struggle with money. I could only dream of living comfortably, not paycheck to paycheck, someday. 

Is this something other people think about? I'm just curious why authors would choose to go this route when they're writing a story.

fpnrhd,humansuitalien,Book recommendations for those that want to become more politically involved,"In light of everything that has happened recently, I want to be more informed. Watching the news and seeing the darkness that seems and feels so prevalent everywhere has often made me wonder if change, positive change, is even possible. 

I'm currently a college student, young, and I have a lot of ideals and passions, but unfortunately, I feel inadequately prepared to have difficult conversations and stand firm in what I believe in. I think a lot of the issues that America (and the world) is facing right now is because of people like me, who know what's right, and don't do anything about what's happening. I want to be more politically involved, but not just blindly angry at everything that's happening. I also want to be more informed, and oftentimes that's what leads me to back away from any time of conflict, because I don't feel fully equipped to argue about the facts and statistics of the things I'm passionate about.

I know this was a bit of a rant, but do any of you happen to have book recommendations that would give me not just factual information, but hope in humanity, and also possibly leadership skills? I'm going to be reading a lot more in lieu of this quarantine, and so anything--from political theory, understanding leadership, or even just short fiction highlighting social issues that affect people today are welcome. If it helps, I'm definitely a liberal, but I want to learn more about both sides of the issue, and currently I'm looking into Socialism. One of the books I'm reading is The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, and any books like these would also be welcome.

fpnkxq,turf_life,I just finished Paradox Bound by Peter Clines and wondered if anyone wanted to talk about it or his other works.,"I've been on a bit of a Peter Clines tear recently. I just finished *Paradox Bound* but prior to that I read *14* and *The Fold*. I didn't want to say much about them and ruin anything(I'm really bad for this, ask my wife) but leave it up to commenters. 


*The Fold* got me started and I'll probably read it again soon, I love it. It kept me engaged and then maybe halfway through the book I just couldn't put it down and finished it in an afternoon.


*14* was great as well and had some really cool ideas and interesting developments or ideas. The same thing happened where I couldn't put it down but I was maybe 2/3 into the book by then. He writes these short chapters with great cliffhanger type endings, each chapter being a bigger cliff than the last, and knows you just NEED to continue reading. There never seems to be a good place to stop. 


*Paradox Bound* was suuuper cool but I almost want to start it over again right now. It has some ideas that are definitely hard to grasp in spots. It was VERY interesting and I think it would make a great movie because there are a lot of characters from different points in History, cool landscapes, awesome mind bending ideas, and tons of action.

fpmuk8,noolvidarminombre,I read Nevernight by Jay Kristoff (spoilers),"Long story short, I didnt really like it. This is a set-up book for a saga and it shows. Here's my opinion of everything ahout it (note: I read the spanish version, so if I accidentally name someone by their spanish name or a direct translation sorry).

#The Worldbuilding

Nevernight's world is really interesting. Between the three suns, the religion about them, how people deal with what should be the day/night cycle, the roman setting, and the creative wonder that is Godsgrave, you get a really good world. 

My problem is we barely get to explore that world due to the fact that most of the story takes place in the Red Church. Most of the time, we are told about the world by the footnotes, rather than explore it and let it be shown more naturally.

#The Characters

*Mia* is easily the best character in the book. I like that even though she has a tragic past, she isnt all angsty all the time, cracks jokes, and is overall a fun character to read. I liked her development of not relying on her cat to absorb her fear feom her dreams and choose to face them. I also liked how she's not treated as someone special due to her powers, and has to actually earn her place like everybody else.

**Tric** is alright. He's not just the broody love interest, he still has fun interactions with Mia, and to a minor extent the other disciples, and has a decent backstory. When he died, I cared about how Mia would react, but not for him

**Ash**'s character suffers a lot from the fact this is a set-up book. For the whole book she just hangs around with Mia and the rest, and when the reveal comes after Mia leaves the church, I couldn't bring myself to care about it because I barely cared for her. Her brother has the same problem but worse, since Mia barely interacts with him. The only interesting thing she has going for her is her betrayal, which happens too late and is clearly a hook for the sequel. The reveal of all the foreshadowing for her betrayal is also way too much in your face.

**Carlota** is a plot device for the siblings to make the poison to knock out everyone. We barely see her even though she was a really good friend to Mia, and sreally only becomes relevant when she dies. She has implications of a backstory and the personality of inexpressive and using dry humour, which aren't the best traits to make a character who dies in book 1 memorable.

**Jessamine** is the generic bad bitch from school archtype so many other YA novels use. She hates Mia and the slave, since she hates a slave you know she's bad. Her sharing the same reason to become a blade as Mia, but blaming her father and hating her is also interesting, but that's barely explored. She tries to screw over Mia once or twice, but overall she's very boring.

**The Shahiids** barely have a personality, focus or relevance. Solis is an asshole and hates Mia, Spiderkiller is an asshole but likes Mia, Mouser is kind of witty but the only class we're shown with him is the first one. Aalea is so attractive she makes Mia lesbian when she describes her, Cassius has no personality then dies, and Drusella is like a granny except when she gets serious. 

From the rest, the most destacable is Chss, who even though his only personality trait is being an all around weirdo, has the second most memorable line in the book, and that has a lot of merit considering how many times the first one is repeated. The likes of the guy who lost an ear or the one who talked to his knife are just background decorations and dont matter.

#The Villians

I found the to be pretty bad, but not in the good way. Out of all of them, the most memorable is Scaeva, and we literally dont see him outside of flashbacks. I couldnt distinguish what the other two guys were supposed to be until the end when one of them died. 

These villians are the main motivation for why the heroine does what she does, but we almost never see them, let alone see them interact with the protagonist. This section should be longer but these villians are so empty I have nothing to say. Also, the way therr are 3 main villians, 3 books, and the first one died here, I think it's pretty safe to say each one will die each book.

**The Plot** 

The first act when they were getting to the Church was fun and introduced concepts and character, the third act was fast-paced action and it was entertaining. But the second act was torture to get through, it was just a bunch of nothing happening between classes. The classes we focused the most on was poisons, which was just a bunch of investing the formula to the antidote for Spiderkiller's favor and those gas bombs that one time. Aalea's classes would've been a good opportunity to explore Godsgrave and show us the world and Mia learning secrets, but the first class she doesnt do that, Cassius' torture sesion is the focus and the rest of her classes are skipped. Mouser's clases had the potential to be the most entertaining, with him having the most entertaining personality, and learning how to steal, deceive and pick locks being interesting skills to be shown in practice, like in a heist or something, or Mia figuring out how to steal the more valuable items, but none of his classes were shown outside of the first one. Solis's classes were literally a waste of time, considering Mia was bad until someone else taught her.

There was potential o make the second act really interesting, but we focused on literally the most boring subject.

#Conclusion

Overall, a meh book that's almost entirely set-up for a saga, which is carried hard by a good Main Character and interesting setting.",2,1585267890,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpmuk8/i_read_nevernight_by_jay_kristoff_spoilers/,books,1

I don't know what happened. In my teenage years (until like 15 or 16 years old) I loved reading. I enjoyed books like the Hunger Games so much that I read them multiple times in a few days.

But then came the more stressful years, I still did well in school, but I stopped reading in my free time.

I emphasized so hard with this character and his political ideas and thinking and then he got broken by too much torture and pain. The last page is really good and states this again. By saying: ""The long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain"" as an indicator that the brain-washing by the Party is completed, right after Oceania won the war against Eurasia. I give that book a solid 8/10 and I admit I really enjoyed George Orwells writing and storyline. Now I will read George Orwell - Animal Farm.

fplcyh,ShananaWeeb,Banned Book that made me ugly cry: A Day No Pigs Would Die by Robert Peck,"I just finished in two sittings A day no pigs would die, a 150 page semi-autobiography that was once banned/censored for explicit animal cruelty/violence and sexual references. I was enraptured and entertained by the writing style of first person POV, a cheeky 12 year old country Shaker Christian bumpkin from Vermont in the 1920s. It’s a coming of age that’s kind of like Old Yeller but with a beloved pig instead and I suspected the ending would make me cry but goddamn I didn’t expect it to hurt so much! I guess I’m a sucker for lost childhood stories. It’s been a while since a novel made me bawl my eyes out, but it hurt more knowing that it is based on true events. When I looked up the title In Reddit I saw other people bashing this book for its grammar, like really?! this is meant to be from a 12 year old boys perspective: one who is almost failing English at school and lives in the country with parents who can’t read or write. It’s about the authenticity. You have nothing to gain with being a grammar nazi. Other people said they didn’t like it either and I want to know why.

It has a solace effect of me. 

“If I could believe’, said Rhoda, 'that I should grow old in pursuit and change, I should be rid of my fear: nothing persists. One moment does not lead to another. The door opens and the tiger leaps. You did not see me come. I circled round the chairs to avoid the horror of the spring. I am afraid of you all. I am afraid of the shock of sensation that leaps upon me, because I cannot deal with it as you do – I cannot make one moment merge in the next. To me they are all violent, all separate; and if I fall under the shock of the leap of the moment you will be on me, tearing me to pieces. I have no end in view. I do not know how to run minute to minute and hour to hour, solving them by some natural force until they make the whole and indivisible mass that you call life. Because you have an end in view – one person, is it, to sit beside, an idea is it, your beauty is it?

Lamana,"I originally read this book when I was younger, and I found it on my bookshelf and decided to read it again. I didn't remember much of it, other than that it was a good book. And younger me was right! It's a wonderful book!

The book is about a family in the midst of Hurricane Katrina, and I think it captures the hopelessness and fear about the situation in the characters well. For example, the main character, Armani, &gt;!feels constant guilt for many things, including accidentally giving her baby sister a water bug, blaming herself for her grandmother's death, getting angry at her father and losing him before she can apologize, and various other things. The guilt she feels is portrayed very well, and comes up often as she continues on her journey.!&lt; The emotions in the characters are written wonderfully, and another great thing is I feel the story captures what it was like to be in that event nicely (not that I was in Hurricane Katrina or even remotely effected by it, but from what I've read and just know about the event, it captures it accurately).

This doesn't mean the book was perfect, however. There were things I didn't like all that much. I didn't really care for the ending. It was written nicely, but I don't like the abruptness of it. I feel like it could've went on a little longer, and I'm left with lots of questions. &gt;!Do Armani and her brother Georgie ever make it back to their mother and sisters? If so, where do they go? What exactly happens to Matthew and the other Boman kids?!&lt; I would've just liked a little more closure. There are a couple other things I disliked, but I don't want to drag this on.

Overall, it was a good book. I enjoyed it this second time. It is more suited for children to read, but I think older people definitely can still enjoy it as well.

I just finished In Our Time by Hemingway, a short story collection and well-known for its role as the pioneer of terse and minimalistic style in literature. 

The short stories were fascinating (Especially Indian Camp and Big two Hearted river), but what grabbed me more was the 100-200 words '*chapters*' between each story. How it could say many things with just one scene. And its descriptive imagery yet maintaining not to be boring and long.

As a dude in creative writing major in university, and a fanboy of Hemingway (As a writer and a person), I am thinking to re-practice my writing by starting with drabbles. More terse and Minimalistic.

I cant even write, I write stories (not in English) and I‘ve stopped for months now.

Then l found out one thing that ease my mind was when I read. I am re-reading Mansfield Park. Reading about people's lives far far away gives me comfort, just read about their conversations about the most unnecessary things (riding horse, picking up roses), read about a girl‘s joy and pain when in love, read about those nice long walks.

What a great escape. Unlike watching a movie, reading takes such a long time and I can totally soak in a different world, run away from whatever that's bothering me.

* Who ended up being your favorite character? What did you think of their development throughout the book?

&gt; The grace of kings is not the same as the morals governing individuals.

* What do you think of this statement? 

* Trust is a very big part of the story? Do you think some of the events in the book could have been prevented if there had been more trust or do you think the characters were correct in mistrusting each other?

fpgznl,slider501,[Review] Burning Province by Michael Prior,"I know we don't get a lot of poetry books on here, but if you want a quick quarantine read by an up-and-coming author, this is a really good one!

Burning Province, released during Covid-19’s upward trajectory, was snubbed of its proper reception. Yet, while cries of a “Chinese Flu” stoke the embers of yellow-peril, Prior’s collection is accidentally more relevant than ever. The poems grapple with generational trauma, and Prior’s cultural inheritance as a descendent of Japanese-Canadians interred in concentration camps. 

Rooted in both the past and the present, Prior evokes one reality clasped within another. Symbols of his ancestral past, such as his grandfather’s axes or his grandmother’s paper cranes, bubble up and gain new significance as he explores his mixed heritage. Reading it felt like traveling through a dreamscape. The language is tender but guileless. Most of all, it’s beautiful. Highly recommend. 

Favorite poems and excerpts:

1.	*White Noise Machine* (1) – “The space between as vast as the river / that renews its boundaries beneath the overpass, before / the waterfall’s pulsing cobalt. How old was I / when his mother wished my brown eyes would fade // to blue?”
 
2.	*My Father’s Birthday Is The Day Before Mine* – “I realize I have no means / by which to make you a present of the past, / where my father once cowered // behind the June sunflowers, bloodied by the dog-chain his father / has swung---not at his son, / but at the fear // of being left without one.” 

3.	*In Cloud Country* – “In cloud country, it rains newspaper cranes, it cries / Fujita scale, it hears your tectonic mumble merge / with ours: there is no scale for now and then. / You are the paper’s one hundred and third fold, / the nebula’s gauzed edge.”

4.	*Steveston* – “A pug grunts, / then crumples in a doorway’s furnace-glow. / It scours its paws with salt and looks / towards the docks. Born into the taught orbit / of a leash, does it know // it wouldn’t float?” 

5.	*Wakeful Things* – “Through the floorboards, / a caterpillar, stripped from its chrysalis by red ants, / wakes, as if to a house aflame. Silk frays / like silver horns, like thoughts branching from a brain.”",0,1585247926,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpgznl/review_burning_province_by_michael_prior/,books,0

There's no reason for Guy to continue to conceal everything and makes things a hundred times worse for himself.  Also, in reality, Anne would be questioning him deeper about Bruno.  She suspects something is going on but just allows him to brush her off.  Then, even worse, Guy tells her he thinks it likely Bruno is a murderer and she decides to spend an entire day alone with him and invite him on a boat trip.  This also again raises the question of why she isn't asking Guy about his connections with a possible murderer. 

Moving onto Bruno himself, the character started with a lot of promise, before just becoming a drunk.  - All the characters drink too much,( why is it necessary for Owen to also get drunk on scotch within minutes of meeting up with Guy during the confession?)  Bruno's obsession with Guy was interesting, I just wish it would have all been handled in a different way.  Again, I don't understand why Guy would decide he like Bruno after all and keep agreeing to meet up with him, only to wish he hadn't.  

All I read is people raving about this book.  There were good bits- Bruno tracking down Miriam and this glimpse inside his sick mind, for one.  Overall Guy's motivation, or lack of credible motivation, just made it too frustrating.",5,1585243318,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fpfigd/strangers_on_a_train_patricia_highsmith_spoilers/,books,0

fpdwbz,TheIberDeber,"For the first time in almost 2 years, I finished a book.","[I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fbo2s9/getting_back_into_reading/) 25 days ago about getting back into reading. I'm 15 years old, and I used to read all the time, but the last time I finished a book I was 13.

That is until 2 days ago.

I found *A Clockwork Orange* at my library in January and decided to check it out. I started reading it the next day at school, but I ran into a few problems.

I have friends who do not like to read at all. Not even audiobooks. I also had no time because of schoolwork.

So I read as much as I could at first but I dwindled and eventually, I found myself not reading the book at all even though I brought it everywhere with me. And the lingo of the book took a while for me to get used to; I read the first chapter 3 times to get used to it.

I had a friend who had read the book already and she loved it. I'm also a big Stanley Kubrick fan and I used this opportunity to read the book before watching the movie. I told this to my ""movie club"" and they had the same idea of reading some books before watching the film.

So that put some pressure on me to finish the book since their books were longer and *Clockwork* is only 212 pages, roughly. So I began reading again.

When I made the post around 25 days ago I finished Part 1 (there are 3 parts with 7 chapters each). To minimize distractions I read alone in my room, but I get in trouble for staying in my room for too long. I didn't get a chance to read again without distractions until 2 days ago. From the beginning of Part 2 until the end. I finished it my little droogies. I feel dobby of myself.

fpcpx9,eastshaolin,chapter one (my novella),"‘…it’s all connected. I’ve been lost since I was fourteen. It just seemed to happen overnight. I can’t remember a beginning. It’s more like a continuation…a continuation of an eternal longing. I don’t know where I am, where I’m supposed to be. All I want is an end. No pain, no cry for help, just silence. I was fourteen when my conscious awareness changed. I began to see through everything. My eyes were open. Regardless of what they tell you, it isn’t a phase. It’s an ego-shattering inner realisation, part of it being that each of us, whatever we think of ourselves, are nothing. We aren’t significant. I’m not implying that we are worthless, rather that we are as exposed to the universe around us as anything else. Our sense of identity, the ideas and standards that we hold aloft, they’re all as disposable as the insects we pay no mind to. We don’t constitute a divine moral compass. And seeing all of this, I’m condemned to watch the cycle of ignorance breed pain, over and over again. I can’t take it anymore. How can there be so few who develop understanding? So many are suffering inside. Generation after generation we’re becoming more awake, trying to break outside of conditioning, searching for a new way to live- albeit unknowingly. Simultaneously depression is increasing, anxiety is increasing. They say that depression is a chemical imbalance. But what if this chemical imbalance wasn’t the reason for depression, but a result? Our minds’ reactions to something else happening within. There’s something deeper that isn’t visible to the way that we understand. It isn’t measurable, or even conceivable in the realm of logic. Language and science only work where language and science work. Feeling spoke to the hearts of beings long before our ultimatums on life. There was something that led me to see that this world doesn’t really exist. It implores me to leave. All of us have it, but only some of us feel it. It’s an inner realisation that none of this is real, and we are slowly moving closer to it. And amidst this realisation that we are fearful of, we’re unable to see what really lies behind it. But I suspect its where everything is. I swear Ewen, I want it more than anything. I’ve cried for it, dreamt of it. Taken whatever I could in the hope that I might touch it, even for a moment. And this crossroads that we find ourselves at, almost realising the illusion but unable to find the light…I think that’s exactly what depression is. It’s why I wait for death. Not to cut out the light, but to end the search inside. The moment I’m no longer trapped in this illusion, I will truly exist.’

The boy was twenty. He worked at a record store. He lived with his aunt; his parents had left him in her care when he was sixteen years old. He hadn’t been in contact with them since. They had always found their son too difficult, too abnormal. His mother was single-minded, very ordered, stringent. The boy’s father was disinterested, unalive, devoid of passion. And they were cold. Cold towards the boy, cold towards life. The boy grew up in a household that knew not of love. The marriage itself was an alliance of mutual interest. The house was the paperwork, a child, the necessary signatures. The boy knew all of this. He was brought into this world out of habit. And for that, he hated his parents. They epitomised all that was wrong with humanity. They lived from routine. Luckily for the boy he had his aunt. She was liberal, warm, maternal. She happily took him in. It had never even crossed her mind to question the boy on the fire that he had allegedly started in his school’s mathematics building. No, for she had seen his pain, and never once met it with contempt.

Depression had long withdrawn the boy within himself. Anxiety was starting to hamper his ability to exist around people. He didn’t have friends- only an acquaintance named Ewen, whom he’d grown rather fond of over the years. Ewen worked at a coffee shop opposite the record store. The area that Ewen and the boy worked in was vibrant and full of ideas. People always circulated the area, staying or passing through. The free-spirited clung to it, and so did the youth, as did hope. It became a cauldron of change, dying to spill out into the dull, dull world. Ewen, the budding socialite, was almost a cultural figure around the area. He was always introducing the boy to new faces, constantly testing his comfort. Every day the boy would arrive at work, Ewen would be dancing along the street, pulling strangers into the café, entering their lives without permission, giving them exactly what they had needed, exactly what had been missing.

The boy was the opposite. Nervous, distrustful, offish. He silently fought to contain the nerves that ate away at him. And whether or not people noticed the humiliation he was subjected to, it was there, reminding the boy. He couldn’t escape. He longed to exist outside of himself, with everybody else, with Ewen. Night often came to the rescue of the boy, rocking himself, underneath the pain that he had succumbed to. It screeched. It cried. It slammed everything good, bad, non-existent or otherwise. His mind showed him things that he didn’t want to see. He had yet to taste love; he dreamt only of tasting his aunt. Why can’t I be like Ewen, he often thought. Life had a different way of happening for the boy.

He arrived home late in the evening. The credits of Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona rolled as he walked into the living area. He imagined how his life would be if he were an artist; expressive, bold. The boy sighed. He looked across the room to his aunt, laying, semi-exposed. She was asleep. However, she emitted a radiant glow. Her large breasts weighed down the bust of her summer dress. Her behind, curvaceous, and not-so-subtle, made itself known to the boy. Years had only accentuated her body’s persuasion. Sweat permeated the boy. The erection that almost sent him to the depths of himself must have caused Hades to appear in his aunt’s mind. In one swift movement she turned and rose, whilst, almost simultaneously, the doors of the living area and the boy’s room were closed. That evening the boy lay, restless. Images of his aunt tormented him. He knew of only one way to make them subside.

The next afternoon the boy arrived at the record store. He saw Ewen talking to a group of middle-aged women, guiding the conversation with his usual sense of urgency. He gestured at the boy to come over, to which the boy retreated into the record store. It was a small setup, comprised of a compact upper room, and a similar sized basement area, that both shelved the records. It only employed three people, however, one of the employees was away travelling somewhere in Asia, leaving the boy and Pavel. Actually, the store was so quiet that it could be run by just one person, but the boy and Pavel usually worked the shifts together. It was an extremely relaxed environment, and all that was expected of the boy was to serve customers, and occasionally sort through records. The same went for Pavel. The owner, whom the boy had never actually met in the four years he’d worked at the store, handled the rest.

The boy was looking through garage rock records when he noticed somebody approaching him.

‘Hey, do you work here?’

‘Yes.’

‘Great. I can’t find the fucking jazz anywhere. Where aren’t I looking?’

The boy scanned the intruder. Before him stood a girl with glistening dark skin, an unquestionable air of assurance, and hair that was separated into two braids, each brushing past a shoulder blade. She was beautiful. The boy readied a reply before his observance became intrusive.

‘Downstairs is all jazz. I recommend you check the records underneath the flickering light.’

‘Thanks love.’

The boy walked to the till assuring Pavel that there were at least four new records from the late sixties on the shelf. Pavel left to investigate, leaving the boy to man the counter as he waited for the girl with the braids. About ten minutes later, she re-emerged from the basement.

‘What records did you find?’ enquired the boy.

The girl laid them out on the counter.

‘What do you think?’

“Well Expansions is like a jazz-funk record. Black Unity is one of Pharoah’s very best. A Love Supreme is one of the best albums you will hear of any genre.’

‘I think I’ll go with A Love Supreme and Black Unity.’

‘A Love Supreme is spiritual bliss. Closing your eyes and feeling it can take you to other realms.’

‘Oh yeah?’

‘Yeah. Wait until you get to Pursuance.’

‘You really believe in other realms?’

‘I was just talking about the sound…well yes. Yes I do.’

‘How can you so assuredly speak of the spiritual? How can you be so sure? Before you try to answer, let me tell you, you can’t. This is exactly where we go wrong as people. I wish everybody would cut the shit and admit that they can’t feel anything they aren’t convincing themselves to. Imagine if we all just stopped, even for a minute. Stopped searching. Quit the worship of the gods. We would be left to look around us and truly see this world that we continue to destroy. Once we stop assuming that there’s another place for us to get to, we might actually start to love the only place that we have. But as long as we keep searching for elsewhere, we’ll never be able to love the earth.’

The boy noticed a tear on the girl’s face that she violently brushed away, but he had already seen it. He considered a moment before speaking.

‘What you’re saying makes sense. It does. But I don’t think its belief that causes us to neglect the earth. I think for many, belief in something higher actually allows them to be better people. I think our mistreatment of the earth comes from elsewhere. Something that causes us to overlook life, even our own. It’s pleasure. To feed it, we are capable of almost anything. It’s essentially what we live for. And there’s also the desire for greater pleasure. Not just to be comfortable, but to have it all. We seem to place so much importance on excess. Our pursuit of more kills us and our world more than a little belief ever has. For it, we will take or give whatever we can, even ourselves.’

The boy again considered within himself. The girl’s attention seemed to have been caught, and he didn’t want to lose it. The boy dug deeper, trying to find reason, trying to connect to this inner understanding that he had tended to for so long, that had led him through the inferno for so long.

‘I do believe there is hope. There’s one thing that always seems to develop, even amongst all the chaos. It’s consciousness. Each new generation seems to be more consciously evolved than the last. I think this happens within a certain period of time, maybe a few thousand years or so, when the consciousness of people around that particular age will slowly grow. There was a time in history when the enslavement of human beings was one of the most lucrative industries in the world. Our grandparents’ generation were generally less accepting and less open-minded than we are. I do think our conscious evolution may be stagnating somewhat, due to our attachment to screens and anything that dissolves our concentration. But over a period of time, one thing will be consistent- the growth of consciousness. This is what I feel might eventually change the world. It’s at least the last hope I hold.’

The boy turned to serve a customer that appeared. He finally charged the girl for the records.

‘It was nice meeting you,’ she said, turning to leave.

‘Wait,’ replied the boy.

‘Pavel, can you watch the store? I’ll be one minute.’

The boy followed the girl with the braids outside.

‘When I was fourteen, I underwent a huge change in consciousness. The way that I related to myself and the world around me changed completely. I think the only difference between the spiritual seemingly existing for some and not being felt by others, is that not everybody is consciously attuned enough to feel it. I’m not talking about religion. I think your earlier point has some relevance there. I’m talking about feeling the spiritual. We are all in different places. In the same way that one may not be able to fathom that two human beings of different ethnicities are one, another may have that same inability in finding the spiritual. Neither person is consciously able to understand the concepts before them. They can’t see what doesn’t exist within the confines of their reality. Imagine if we understood this. Understood that consciously, we are all in different places; that we all have so much further to go on our journeys individually and collectively. Understood that the conviction with which we believe does not constitute reality. What a change from this alone we would experience! We could stop being so certain of what does or doesn’t exist- we could stop punishing each other for what we fail to see. Our inability to understand each other inhibits us so much. The only difference between what does or doesn’t exist, is what one can perceive. And our conscious awareness is limited to our perception.’

The girl smiled.

‘Thanks for the talk love.’

And with that, she was gone.

Later that evening, Ewen entered the store with unfamiliar faces.

‘I have some friends I want you to meet. This is Amy, and this is…Tammy right?’

‘Yes Ewen. Still Tammy.’

Ewen continued.

‘So we were planning on walking around for the night, smoking, talking. You should come.’

‘No I ne-…I want to be home early tonight,’ said the boy.

‘Suit yourself,’ Ewen replied.

The boy finished work and left the store with Ewen, Amy and Tammy. They stood for a moment, something looming in the summer air, eventually spilling out into conversation.

‘I met this girl earlier.’

‘The girl with the braids. Yeah I saw her walk in earlier,’ replied Ewen.

‘She was great. Our conversation just flowed.’

‘I met her a few weeks ago in the coffee shop. She’s cool. But listen, me, Amy and Tammy were having a conversation that I wanted to hear your thoughts on.’

‘Well, me and Tammy were having a conversation before Ewen invited himself into it. We were basically talking about how we don’t believe that humans are designed to be monogamous creatures. I mean, when you look around, it’s so hard for people to stay with only one partner. I think we all at least know of somebody who has cheated on their significant other. And that doesn’t speak for the even wider majority of people whom we don’t know have cheated on their partner, either because it’s been buried underneath the carpet, or they haven’t been found out. Me and Tammy…’

‘Me and Amy both think that it’s the idea that people like more than anything else. We are attached to the ideal of being with one person and creating a home. But for us to actually live accordingly is another story. It’s something we struggle to do. The fact that we struggle so hard to do it, probably shows that we aren’t necessarily built to be with one person. We all love fucking right? If it feels so good, why should we reserve it?’

‘So this was their position when I overheard them,’ said Ewen.

‘And I disagree. I don’t think it’s a question of nature. I think whether monogamy is for someone or not really depends on the individual, and in the same vein, an individual can change their own ability to be monogamous depending on where they are in their thoughts and beliefs at any given time in their lives. I do agree that we idealise monogamy. But I think that we do this because our inner selves are actually trying to actualise this. It’s somewhere that we, depending on where we are in our lives, want to be; it becomes a focal point in our mind to have one loving and loyal partner who we can build a life with. But I recognise that there’s something that often prohibits us from achieving this. I think it’s our lack of self-control. This makes it difficult for us to see past temptation in the moment. Even people who want to be faithful to their partner may find sexual desire too great a potential pleasure to turn down. I think our lack of control stops us from achieving even what we truly wish for.’

The boy stood, in thought. Amy and Tammy’s argument had made sense, but what Ewen argued also seemed likely.

‘I’ve had this feeling for a while now. I remember arguing it in my Theology classes at school. It’s something I’ve suspected for some time. It was the same realisation that came to me earlier when I was speaking to the girl with the braids. Neither of us were right, or wrong. I began to think about this when I explained to her how people who differed in conscious awareness’ were not open to the same realities. Their perceptions were different. But I immediately understood that this applied to us, in that moment, too. All day since I’ve been thinking about how both of us were speaking from within our own realities. We were both coming from limited understandings.’

‘Here he goes,’ laughed Ewen.

‘Just listen. This inner feeling, it leads me to see how everything is relative, regardless of how strongly we feel about any particular. Hundreds of years ago in many places the world over, it would have been not only permissible, but the norm for an adult male to marry a twelve year-old child. That same man today would be a paedophile, and any sexual act between the two would be considered rape. Earlier today, I used the example of the enslavement of human beings. I used it to explain how humans may have done terrible things in times of greater ignorance. To us, today, slavery is a violation of a living being. But to many, hundreds of years ago, it may not have been. It was seen as a lucrative industry. Now, neither pain nor suffering depend on any action, they depend on whomever is subject to said pain or suffering. For example, pain is not only attached to an action in itself, but is determined by one’s response to an action. Although generally speaking certain actions will cause most of us pain, this is not absolute. There are also different elements to pain and suffering, such as emotional and physical. Some may experience emotional pleasure from physical pain. And vice-versa. How can right and wrong be gauged by what applies generally, and not absolutely? Besides, as long as we remain attached to any particular belief, there is little that stands in the way of us choosing an action that causes suffering. Beliefs are subject to bend, whether through new ideas, experiences, or even something as temporary as emotion. How can they be reliable pillars for morality? We harbour emotional attachments to the concepts of murder, rape, slavery; they are some of the most horrific acts that we can envisage. However, if one were to make a conscientious effort to separate oneself from the need to emotionally attach to an idea or a thought or a belief, one is capable of understanding that it is only a matter of perception. And this is what determines reality. Perception. If I separate myself from the need to know and to be certain, and then consider the reality of a schizophrenic, I cannot say that what that person experiences isn’t real. Nor can I say that what I experience is.’

The boy paused to make sure that he still held the attention of the audience. Although astounded, perhaps a little alarmed, they listened, intently.

‘Imagine a circle. This circle represents perception. Calculating a mean of the general perception of the populace, anybody who lies within the circle is considered sane. Nobody shares a point with another, no matter how slight, every perception is different. Two people whose perceptions lie at opposite sides of the circle may experience very different realities, however, both are considered sane, or normal. They perceive closely enough to the general perception to be considered such. But, anybody who’s perception lies outside of the circle, however slight, is considered insane. What that person experiences is too far away from the general perception. It isn’t a question of being real. It’s a question of how close one’s perception is to the general perception of the population. An outlier, somebody of extreme intelligence, or somebody who is enlightened, could be considered insane on the basis that their reality is too different. Whether or not they are hailed as a genius or the messiah would depend on the people. I guess the crux of what I’m saying is this. With just a little understanding as to how fickle our ever-so-certain reality is, we could realise that there is no certainty. With this realisation, right and wrong will disappear. The walls of our surety will collapse. Rigidity will be destroyed. And with our new found awareness that nothing really is, the space will be left for us to finally understand one other.’

It also occurred to me that I’m not going to read all of them, or all of them again...so maybe someone who doesn’t have a copy would like to read it.

Since libraries and thrift shops are closed, I thought why not do person to person lending, if someone can not afford to buy from one of the excellent independents that are still operating during quarantine.

Because people were curious to see a full ""Asterix the Gaul"" collection I present you the collection my farther has started and I continued.  
The Asterix Comics played a big part in my childhood. I have beautiful childhood memories of reading those comics with my father and later in our family room. I basically ""ate"" them as you tend to say in German and to this day remember scenes from the comics as if I had read them yesterday. When they were in Rome with Majestix because he had stomach pain and they were so drunk they turned words around. When Asterix and Obelix were Legionaries and they brought their centurion to a meltdown. When they were in Egypt and Obelix broke the nose of the sphinx. Or just when they were on their journey through Spain and they had to foster a child.  
I'm looking forward to future comics still. And I will always remember the good times I had with those comics.

Finally, I finished this book well into my 7th day of quarantine and I am not disappointed. This book is an excellent place to start if you're new into the genre of Magic Realism, as it's a lighter read than most of Rushdie's other work. This book has an universal appeal even though it centres around a very specific place and time. A little bit of political knowledge will help you a lot in treading through the book but I'm pretty sure it is as enjoyable for those who do not know anything about the socio-political background of the book.

Personally, up until high school, the loner type was my favorite. The outcast and orphan types with a sense of wonder tended to pull me in. Inept but arrogant OR eccentric nerd types were also interesting. I had a short run with mean girls and ""I'm not like other girls"" types as well lol. The common thread with all my characters were that they were very much in their own heads/worlds (which could be said of many main characters, yeah, but I liked heavy internal dialoguers). I didn't often feel alone (and very rarely lonely), but in one way or another, they were unconscious self-identifications. I didn't even notice until the pattern was so obvious that I'd primarily look to books with main characters who would mostly only talk to non-humans/machines or were agoraphobic. I don't read so much fiction anymore, so I'm not sure my type these days.

fp5ca1,OccAzzO,Books during quarantine are fantastic...,"I'm a sophomore in highschool and school is now online through April, 22 (though probably for a while longer). With this knowledge I so wisely chose to binge video games for a while. I even bought a bunch of new (to me) games due to the Steam Quarantine sale. I'm now bored out of my mind with the aforementioned vices of binary origin. 

My parents are utter bookworms (as am I) with a veritable library at home. I asked for some challenging books and he handed me these.

 - American Psycho - Ellis

 - The Bonfire of the Vanities - Wolfe

 - The Illuminatus Trilogy - Shea &amp; Wilson

 - Trainspotting - Welsh

 - Cat's Cradle - Vonnegut

 - Replay - Grimwood

I am super excited to become absorbed by their words and be transported to other worlds. Once I finish these, what would you recommend?

fp4srd,XxItsNowOrNever99xX,What book would be radically different if the main point of view was from a different character instead of the main character?,"I'll start with an example - Draco Malfoy from Harry Potter. Since the story takes place in Harry's perspective, we see Malfoy as a bully, spoiled brat, and villain who seeks to torment Harry and his friends whenever he can. However, if we change the main perspective so that it follows Malfoy, it would be the story of an insecure boy who has high expectations placed on him, who is jealous of Harry for being famous for no apparent reason, and becoming progressively more horrified and disturbed by the actions of the people his parents associate themselves with, of which whom he once respected and admired.   

And also a non-book example, but Meg from Family Guy. This show would be A LOT more disturbing from her perspective, as it would be a story about a teenage girl who is bullied, humiliated, and abused by her family for her whole life. And yet, because she isn't the main character, her abuse is simply framed as comedic and being not that big of a deal.",59,1585195077,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fp4srd/what_book_would_be_radically_different_if_the/,books,1

fp4go5,1H4rsh,How seriously do you take book recommendations from friends in real life?,"I made this post because I wanted to know if other people feel the way I do about borrowing/gifting books. Reading has a special place in my heart and to me, receiving a book from someone else either means that the book means a lot to them and that they want to share it or that they believe I would really enjoy it. Either way, I genuinely enjoy reading these books because it helps me know the other person better and I try to get to them ASAP. However, lately I’ve been feeling like the same courtesy isn’t usually extended to me. 

For example, I met this person a year ago who said that they loved reading. We became pretty good friends and we did a sort of book swap thing. I got to the one they gave me within a week or two and when I finished it, let them know what I thought about it! Sadly, though, they didn’t extend the same courtesy to me. It’s been almost 5 months and the only update I’ve gotten is a slight mention that they read one of the two I gave them with no other follow up. Since they didn’t even mention whether they liked it or not, I doubt they even read it in the first place. 

At this point it just feels sort of disrespectful because I see them reviewing other books and movies so they’re clearly not busy (especially with the virus and everything).

The same has happened with another person as well but this second person has actually apologised for not being able to read them (and I know that they’re pretty busy) so at least I know they’re being sincere. 

Regardless, I feel pretty frustrated when this happens, especially with the first person. It might just be me being petty but I feel like when you borrow/gift someone a book or exchange books with people, you’re giving them your word that you will read it as soon as possible.",7,1585193619,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fp4go5/how_seriously_do_you_take_book_recommendations/,books,1
fp445j,vitsensei,A thought on English novel by a non-native English speaker,"Growing up, I read a lot of books, all in my mother tongue. Some of the translated ones are of French or Russian author (Sans Famille, Victor Hugo short stories, some of Leo Tolstoy’s) and some Chinese books, most notably Romance of the Three Kingdom.

Anyways, funny enough I didn’t read English books all that much. Or at least I don’t remember that I did. I read some of the books my brother left behind when he went to uni but those were old, and the cover were mostly torn. Maybe some of them were English. I did read through about 9 books in the series Chicken Soup for the soul though.

It’s only recently, thanks to the lockdown, that I started reading more English book (in English). Of mice and man, Animal Farm, Flower for Algernon and just a moment ago I finished “I am Legend”. I tried my best to follow the story line. The first three books were an easy to read (in term of English) but the last one was a bit more fancy. I enjoy it though.

Now I start reading Watership Down. I like rabbit so I think it should be fine.

fp3r1t,JimFan1,Interpretation of The Fall (Camus),"Long post ahead: \***Minor spoilers for** ***The Stranger*** **and** ***The Plague***\*.

Recently, I completed *The Fall*, and I'm trying to piece it together with the rest of Camus' fictional oeuvre -- specifically, *The Stranger* and *The Plague --* to better understand how *The Fall* furthers Camus' notion of the absurd and his views on morality. Before providing my interpretation, I'd like to provide a very brief, simplified summary of those two prior works. 

* *The Stranger*: Meursault's unexplained actions reveals to us the existence and the conditions of the absurd (though, from his perspective, the absurd is the punishment, the trial, his mother's death and the external circumstances in his life). In other words, the existence of our desire to ascribe meaning, but our frequent inability to, creates the feeling of tension (absurdity).
* *The Plague*: With the absurd established as a condition of consciousness, Dr. Rieux's choices in the face of the absurd indicates a possible source of morality (Camus was no nihilist) grounded in our resistance. The greater the force, which in this case was a havoc induced Plague, the more we become aware of our individual ""true"" morality. Choosing to live is itself a moral decision, it seems. That said, Camus, in his idealism, perhaps believed the absurd could push us towards something greater: a grand, collective morality rooted in such resistance. 

So, where exactly does this leave us with *The Fall* \-- a novel preoccupied with a duality of man (innocence - guilt; altruism - selfishness; freedom - slavery; judgement - penitence)? *The Fall* arguably even goes so far as to ask us to consider a world where existence is guilt and by choosing to live, you are guilty.  I've gathered and debated three interpretations, though all are simultaneously possible.

1. The first is that *The Fall* is a confessional from Camus, critiquing his life and prior beliefs. He mentions that he used to (paraphrase) 'espouse Freedom and rub it on his toast like butter,' which he had advocated for (until later in life, when weighing it against justice), the constant womanizing, regret over a possible woman's suicide (his wife attempted on herself due to the womanizing), and fall from grace in intellectual circles, certainly sounds like his life. In this view, Camus represents the Judge-Penitent and he is exposing himself, so that he may spread the guilt of his existence to humanity and in a method more equitable. This implies that to have the moral high ground, judgement of others requires judgement of the self first.  
2. The second is that the *The Fall* is a response to the Existentialists (particularly Sartre's *Nausea*), who believed that man is elevated to freedom when man finally achieves consciousness of himself, awareness of the contingency of the world, and behaves authentically. *The Fall*, by revealing man's duality, implies that once man recognizes his consciousness and achieves absolute freedom, he will come to understand that he is responsible for everyone. Alone. Freedom carries with it an unbearable weight: guilt. Jesus realized this. As the son of God, he had to be free, but as a man, that freedom was too heavy and he died to ease his suffering. Not ours. At one point, the Judge-Penitent advocates for slavery -- just don't call it slavery, that would be too authentic, and remind us of the truth -- but do it with a smile and call it something else. This might be Camus telling us that sometimes it's fine to lie to ourselves because, really, how authentic is the authentic man anyway (using virtue as a means to succeed, humility to bolster and so on). Constant authentic living isn't possible and would crush us.
3.  Saw this elsewhere, but the final interpretation is that you are supposed to *root against* the Judge-Penitent. In the novel, Camus mentions the silliness of killing oneself, for people will misunderstand the reason and botch up point behind the suicide such as the death of Jesus, which merely brought Jesus to martyr status (back again to using goodness and achieving a self-serving means) rather than elevating humanity and washing away our sins (as was likely the intent). Camus might have recognized that the only way man get himself out of the muck that is life is cognition of our flaws through means similar to religion, which in Camus mind, espouses negation and fear. That's right. There was a reason for those constant allegories about Dante's *Inferno*. In this view, it's not Camus who is Judge-Penitent, but us, the reader. We judge the narrator, only to then realize that the judgement stems from our feeling of guilt, which stems to the similarities we have with him. The further he falls and tries to feel better about himself, the more we see in ourselves. In the end, he crashes, but we can avoid that crash. It is the narrator who takes the fall, so that we may finally stop being the judge and become penitent.

Does anyone have any thoughts on this? If you've read any of his non-fiction works (*The Rebel* or *Myth of Sisyphus*, neither of which I've read) is this perhaps in line with them? Any discussion, disagreement or otherwise, is more than welcome.

Positives:

1. I think setting a tangible yet a bit ambitious goal and striving to reach it can give you a sense of purpose.

2. You can certainly experience a sense of accomplishment if you reach it- or even coming close to reaching it- by the end of the year.

3. It can improve your reading game by making you read more. I can see it helping those struggling with trying to make reading a habit.

Now the negatives:

1. I think it can foster a sort of a rat-race mindset which can be conducive to stress. What if you struggle with reading faster or you have responsibilities relating to your work or personal life that require a good chunk of your time and energy making it harder for you to commit yourself to such an endeavour but the fear of falling behind others who have taken up this challenge becomes a major cause for your perturbation? 

2. And then as opposed to having it be about- spending time with a character; not merely reading the story, but living the story; meditating on its various underlying themes; taking the perspective of the character or the author and scrutinising it and challenging it where need be, taking that perspective to others to have it be discussed- it can become, for the most part, about chasing an arbitrary number.


In conclusion I won't tell you which one you should follow. That's upto you to decide. I tried to, as fairly as I could, make the case both for and against the approach. 

Which side do you take when it comes to this question? 

For myself I used to follow the 52 books a year approach. With degrees I've begun to lean in the direction of not having any book goal and strictly making it be about the quality of my reading experience. The enjoyment, the learning etc and if that means reading far fewer number of books than I might have otherwise read then so be it.",69,1585172794,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/foyygb/do_you_see_this_52_books_a_year_trend_productive/,books,1

Bittersweet candies make me remember the unfettered happiness of being a kid and the cascading waves of reticence that come with growing up.

She stopped the young daughter from playing with Stoner and subsequently up until his death he didnt have any real relationship with the daughter.

fosn6n,Kryptin,Why We Need More Telling and Less Showing,"You've heard ""Show, Don't Tell."" Showing is basically explained by the famous quote;  

&gt;Don’t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass.

The purpose of showing is immersing the reader by creating a more vivid picture in their mind. But it is so overdone in most novels today that it becomes an annoyance. 

OK. I'll just post some passages from Harry Potter &amp; The Half Blood Prince to illustrate my point. Whatever I've italicized, I consider unnecessary showing. 

**Spoiler Warning!**

&gt;The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.  
&gt;  
&gt;“News?” asked the taller of the two.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The best,” replied Severus Snape.  
&gt;  
&gt;*The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched*.

So, the last paragraph here is just showing for the sake of showing. The reader just want to know what happens next, but here is Rowling showing the characters' walk down an irrelevant lane. Rowling doesn't just tell, she shows by describing the lane and the physics of the men's cloak.  

Let's look at more.

&gt;Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. *They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.*

Rowling continues to show their walk to Lucius' house. Now the summary here is that Snape and Yaxley head down to join the death eaters in Lucius' house, briefly conversing. Rowling could've got away with telling here. All these descriptions intended to show, very few readers care about them. 

When I discussed the writing sub, I was down-voted but that's because they don't understand what telling is. Telling is not simply stating something, combining simple sentences with coordinating conjunction or comma. Telling can be done creatively and dynamically without simple and monotonous sentences.",11,1585151689,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fosn6n/why_we_need_more_telling_and_less_showing/,books,1

fos07o,MadeOfJello,Stories centered around a psychological game,"Hello! As the title suggests, I am looking for short stories/books/graphic novels/manga that revolve around a central psychological game. I say 'psychological' to exclude dystopian survival games like the Hunger Games, since the series does not focus on the protagonist's intelligence used to outwit the competition and win. The premise of these YA games are also not heavily reliant on mental trickery and the like. In addition to a game hosted by a mysterious organization/nameless benefactor, I would actually say something like the back and forth between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty, or Light Yagami and L, could be seen as a 'psychological game' as well. I also think something like Shutter Island makes for the same, or similar, kind of reading experience in terms of being a mentally stimulating mind-fuck.

I find this trope to be much more common in manga and webtoons, but would love to find stories originally in English to read. 

Content in this category that I have enjoyed are: Shutter Island (book &amp; movie), Death Note, Liar's Game, Sherlock Holmes and most Agatha Christie books, and Twelve Monkeys (movie). I'm sure there are more. I would also like to note that I would not count something like House of Leaves as belonging to this category, because despite being a mind-fuck, there is not a clear opposition to be bested or a game whose loopholes can be cleverly taken advantage of.

Thanks!",1,1585149425,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fos07o/stories_centered_around_a_psychological_game/,books,1

They issued letters yesterday, to every employee, for them to show law enforcement that they are essential and must be allowed to work.

This publisher / distributer is risking their lives, the lives of their families, and everyone they come into contact with in our town.

The employees are scared to work, but also to stay out of work due to possible repercussions and the use of all of their allotted time off.

I often feel crappy about myself about knowing too little, feel that I don't belong somewhere, but now I realize maybe everyone feels like that sometimes and it's okay. What's not okay is to trust that feeling and let go and just give up, thinking that you're not worthy. If I know too little, I just have to keep on learning.

I normally wouldn't share my thoughts about a book like I am doing right now because I feel like this is an erudite community and I don't have the same level of intellect as them.

(just reached chapter 5),"So I'm reading chapter 4 and finding out how, hearing Totsky wanted to get married, she set out with a vendetta to ruin his life. WHY??? I dont understand it. From what I read, he adopted her and paid for her to have a good education. so she hates him? It also mentioned tho that he would go to the little house she was staying at for a few months at a time, was the author implying sex stuff? if not, i cant imagine why she hates him all of a sudden.(other than she wanted to marry him herself, but that is quickly dismissed in that chapter, though i guess if that could still develop)

im also asking this cuz, Nastasya herself states(when totsky and the general are talking to her) that ""if she accepted the money now it was not as payment for the loss of her maidenly honour, for which she was in no way to blame, but simply as a compensation for her ruined life."" what the fuck about her life is ruined? and what is this maidenly honour shes talking about? i googled it but got no hints.

so, without spoilers, can someone explain to me what i missed? cuz it feels like i missed something important. if totsky abused her or used her sexually in the past i can understand the hate but at the same time dostoyevesky doesnt make it clear at all if that happened, so much so im thinking it didn't at all. which begs the question, whats her problem?

Usually portrayed as masterpieces and hugely recommended by anyone who's ever read them. Even if all of this is true, there's always an exception to the rule. I want to know about these exceptions. It fascinates me how there can be two diametrically opposed perspectives about the same book.

My exception to the rule is ""A brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. Although I can recognize the social impact it must've had at the time of it being written, It just didn't do it for me. It's not easy to criticize such a heavyweight, and it's actually difficult to point exactly what made it almost a chore to get through for me. Personally, I didn't love Huxley's writing; too dull and impersonal for my liking. There's also some personal issues with the plot itself, but that'd be going in too deep.

foej2u,lukejmcgrath,For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway,"Ernest Hemingway is one of a small class of writers, along with names like Dickens, Austen, and Proust, who can simultaneously terrify and excite a reader. Perhaps most like Jane Austen, we’re often judged not by which of their books we’ve read but whether we’ve read something by them. It’s the mark of a truly great author that one can’t choose a single piece of work, like we might with a Fitzgerald or Salinger.

For me, Hemingway has always been a name that I feared to read. His works seem weighty, almost too highly revered even among “books you must read” lists. The beauty of my reading project is that I must meet head-on writers whose names are new to me as well as those I’ve long avoided tackling through one fear or another.

Published in 1940, For Whom the Bell Tolls is based on Hemingway’s experiences during the Spanish Civil War, which had ended the previous year. Like the earlier A Farewell to Arms, it follows a love story against the backdrop of a major and recent conflict.

For Whom the Bell Tolls tells the story of American Robert Jordan as he fights for guerrillas during the war. Experienced with explosives, Jordan is set to destroy a key bridge but finds the local resistance difficult to work with. He also begins to fall in love with a Spanish girl, Maria, who has lost her family to the fighting.

There are many highlights in this novel, not least of which is enjoying Hemingway’s unique and persuasive style of writing. It sits somewhere between journalism, history and adventure. Yet, no matter how truthful and grounded he writes, Hemingway never forgets the main job of any novel, to entertain. In the hands of a lessor writer, For Whom the Bell Tolls would have been a great adventure story, from Hemingway it’s an epic of war, humanity, love and sacrifice.

In their original review of the novel TIME described For Whom the Bell Tolls as:

1) a great Hemingway love story; 2) a tense story of adventure in war; 3) a grave and sombre tragedy of Spanish peasants fighting for their lives.

This seems to me a fair summary and a clipped-down opinion that Hemingway would have approved of. Unique in my project to date, Hemingway is an author I know that I’ll return to again and again for the sheer quality of his work. The novel is, as all great works are, many things to many people. The discussion around For Whom the Bell Tolls is not whether it’s a masterpiece, but for which of many reasons each reader believes it is.",8,1585088460,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/foej2u/for_whom_the_bell_tolls_by_ernest_hemingway/,books,1

foeh0m,lukejmcgrath,Emma by Jane Austen,"The idea of reading Jane Austen tends to split readers into those who will read her over and over, and those, like me, who’ve never been interested. Since finishing the novel, I can redefine those two groups as those who will read her over and over and those who really should.

One of the reasons I’m reading through many novels that I’ve never approached before is to create a library for my daughters to grow up with. Today, they’re two and half, and five months old so it will be a while before they open up Emma. I’m already looking forward to our first conversation about Austen and her characters, though it’s more than a decade away. I hope this review still makes sense and still lives somewhere by then.

Emma, the only novel of Austen’s to take its main character as a title, was published in 1815. It follows the romantic life of Emma Woodhouse, a headstrong, smart and wealthy woman who enjoys meddling in the love lives of others but knows very little about herself.

The story of Emma is good and reasonably complicated for something of a farce, but it’s the character that makes the novel so special. Emma portrays herself as a love expert, whilst knowing nothing about her own feelings. She lies to herself more than others and we follow her as she begins to notice and understand her own affections. She’s a fully-drawn character, conflicted and at times harsh, but all the more human for it.

Austen’s eye for social manners, chivalry and class make her something of a chronicler of regency life. Yet, she’s much more than a historian, creating some of the most detailed and realistic characters of her time. Emma should be read by anyone experiencing first or early love as a guide to how we can simultaneously know so much and so little about ourselves. For that matter, Emma seems to know more about our hearts that we ever do, no matter how old or experienced we may think we are.

As John Mullen says in his insightful essay How Jane Austen’s Emma changed the face of fiction, “the narrative was radically experimental because it was designed to share her delusions. The novel bent narration through the distorting lens of its protagonist’s mind.” Read with this insight in mind, Emma is an instruction manual for the love-lost.

Emma was the first Austen novel I’ve read and I’m certain it won’t be the last. I’d recommend it to anyone who’s never been interested in Jane Austen or period fiction. Now I just wish I was closer to the end of my list, so I could read her all over again.",2,1585088257,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/foeh0m/emma_by_jane_austen/,books,1

It was an essay, or a blog post, or a prologue, or something by Umberto Eco where he talked about the process of writing The Name of the Rose.

He explained how he invented ""the world of the Abbey"" based on other abbeys he had seen. He told of one time he meet a teenage fan who liked his book despite not understanding it very well, and Umberto then explained that maybe some people liked his book because of the ""atmosphere"" and he wondered if this teenage kid even realized that it was detective story where the detective looses.

Finally he talked about how he sometimes sees the world more as a Medieval man than a modern day man, giving the example of one time his give wanted to show him something, a sun set I think, o a tree, and he didn't pay attention so she got angry, but that later he described something very similar in one of his books, so his wife said: ""you were paying attention after all!"" but he replied ""I wasn't, I just know how it would have looked for a Medieval man who was paying attention"".

foc5g4,LoreOllipop,Talking about George R. R. Martin,"Good evening,
Is anyone interested in the author I've mentioned? He's pretty famous...
I've would like to talk about his originality. Do you think he is THAT revolutionary?
Have you got any example that could prove if he is really a genius as his fans claim or not?

Everyone always talk about he representing sex as a weapon and the ""big"" world he created (how about ""Dune"" saga?). Any example to prove that these themes as well as others in GOT are not so original?

foc4gn,AnarchistRifleman,"I've just finished Lightning by Dean Koontz and, uhh....","So like many other people, after reading a handful of Stephen King, many recommendations had the name of Dean Koontz in it. Last night I finished my first book by him and I found it to be very underwhelming.


It starts off well, the Guardian that intervenes and prevents her from being delivered by an alcoholic doctor was a nice beginning, but the rest...

Part of the book felt kinda rushed and VERY formulaic. Like, a man stalks her, she confronts the man, they get married. The lady then has a kid who ends up being a little genius who, at the age of 8, can perfectly describe what a paradox is and knows what SS stands for.


Some of the parts were also felt like they were ""too perfect to ever happen"" , even in a time travel fi tion book. Like, when Stefan gets shot, she stops by the house of a doctor, who obviously gets out and helps her. I mean, what the fuck? Why on earth would the guy even leave his house like that?


Another thing  that really bugged me is how perfect the things flow. She recovers from a shitty childhood, becomes a writer, sells a fuckton of books and ends up a millionaire. Her lifelong friend also makes big millions just ""for the sake of it"".


I guess that's it. Before reading looking at goodreads, all the reviews were mostly positive and for the most part, I felt like my first Koontz book would be the one that blew me away. As I finished the book, I couldn't help but wonder how great the storyline could've become if things were a little more, should I say, on the ground.


Are the other books by Dean Koontz like this: rushed and underwhelming? I think it's well known that his newer output is downright garbage that he shits forth for the sake of the big bucks. However, by reading one of his older books and feeling very underwhelmed, I feel like the actor can't possibly be even above average.",30,1585080497,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/foc4gn/ive_just_finished_lightning_by_dean_koontz_and_uhh/,books,1

foball,myaccountforIRLstuff,Does reading more often increase reading speed?,"Hey, I'm wondering if this problem is better described as a personal defect or a skill that can be increased over time.

I'm trying to get into reading, but I am having trouble focusing and reading quickly. I was never much of a reader when I was younger, but now it's difficult to start. My attention will drift elsewhere and I have to pull it back. Also, I tend to pause and think about whatever I'm reading for a while. My mind is somewhat tangential and causes me to doze off while analyzing what I've just read. I hope that makes sense.

Also, I tend to pause and look up the words I don't understand. This does increase my comprehension but decreases my speed.

I'm wondering if this process will get easier if I read more often, or if this is the type of reader I am (or possibly a combination of both). Does anybody relate?

Best wishes,

foawon,TheFireHallGirl,"""Anne of Avonlea""","I'm currently reading ""Anne of Avonlea"", which, for those who haven't read the series, is the second book in the ""Anne of Green Gables"" series. I know the series is categorized as a series for young adults, but I have enjoyed reading these books for a couple reasons:

1. I never had the chance to read them when I was younger. I knew of the ""Anne of Green Gables"" story when I was younger, but at the time, there was a TV show here in Canada based on the books and it didn't interest me at the time.
2. My family and I didn't really do a lot of shopping for books.
3. It's a great piece of Canadiana in the sense that it all happens in Prince Edward Island and mentions things like the political parties that would have been around at the time and things like that.
4. It's a great piece of what small town living could be to somebody who may not be living in a small town.

These may be silly things to list off, but it's a book that I'm enjoying. I'm not a fast reader, but I do enjoy it and hope to get all the books in the series when I get the chance.",39,1585076540,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/foawon/anne_of_avonlea/,books,1

fo5m4f,Xero818,"So, i read the rules, there's nothing about discussing books we're working on, it seems.","I'm currently working on a book, and i'd like to know what you all think. It's called The Ancient Isles, it's about Gina Rogers, a girl who, like everyone else, practices magic. There are five islands in her world, each is a siphoning point for a different kind of magic. It's going to be a hard magic system (i.e. there are strict rules on what magic can or can't do, and they cannot be bent or broken.) and it begins when Gina goes to a high school for magic. yes, that sounds very Harry Potter-esque but Harry Potter was my main inspiration. Anyway, she goes to a school for magic, and meets her new friends after passing the entrance exam. everyone has a magic level, where, like in My Hero Academia, your power is loosely based on luck. Gina, like everyone else who got in, has a high magic level. She's special, yeah, but in this school, being special isn't gonna cut it. There are many classes about different types of magic, from types of potions, to all kinds of spells. There isn't a villain, per se, but there are many forces that interfere with her classes, such as bullies, teachers, spells that lock off a section of the school for renovations, which forces her to take the long way 'round, but there is an antagonist: The Principal. yes, you heard me right. The Principal. The Principal/founder of the school created it in order to siphon magic into the school itself using his special spell: Puppeteer. this spell allows him to take control of any force and redirect it, in this case, the magic. he redirected the magic's siphoning point to the school itself, allowing him to grow in magical prowess as days go by. however, he only did this in order to make the students stronger as well, allowing them to be amazing witches and wizards after graduation because of everything they've been taught as well as the immense power that builds up over time. he's the antagonist because Gina and her two friends are the protagonists, and The Principal's ideas clash with theirs. Gina and her friends believe that if you tamper with magic, it tampers with you (i.e. you can't cheat the system or there will be consequences.) because of the fact that, you know, there are magic GODS, so yeah, but The Principal believes that if you can't break the rules or bend them, there has to at least be a loophole. after all, none of the magic rules set in stone by the gods prevent him from doing this, and it's a good idea in the long run, so why not? Then, we reach the end of the book. Gina's a decade and a half older now, and she just has one thing to say: He brought on the Magic Singularity. Magic became so powerful thanks to The Principal that it couldn't be controlled, and now everyone is too powerful for their own good, so Gina surpressed the power the school being a siphoning point gave her. Now, even if she uses one spell, she risks killing dozens, sometimes thousands depending on the power. what do you think?",4,1585058601,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fo5m4f/so_i_read_the_rules_theres_nothing_about/,books,1

fo3uxi,GoatLawd,Thought I'd share my little triumph,"So I have never been much of a reader. Actually I only ever read when I was forced to (textbooks, book reports in grade school etc.). A couple months ago I decided to pick up a book and challenged myself to see it through. Fast forward a couple weeks, and I actually finished a book for the first time in almost a decade. I'm on my third book in two months and I'm hooked. I found myself casually bringing up what I was reading in conversations with my friends and family, who were in shock because I've never really been the type to start intellectual conversations. 

One thing I have discovered is how weak of a reader I am, but I've already begun to notice improvements. My biggest challenge is trying to find a balance between books I can read and enjoy without it having to be too much of a struggle. 

Anyways that's my little victory!

fo3d67,blubbyxunicorn,Robert Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was the most brain-frying short story to understand,"Hi all!

I read 'All You Zombies' a while ago when I was in high school but every now and then I remember this short story because of how confusing it was to understand. I remember having such an a fun time trying to understand the whole timeline of all the events that happened and my entire English class sat together on the floor, discussed the whole story, annotated every sentence, drew maps of the timeline and shared the stories with other our classmates when we moved to our next class. My brain was so fried as we pieced together the timeline but I really loved this story for the way it brought so much active discussion, especially for me as I was very shy and refused to discuss any texts we learnt. 

I was wondering if anyone else had read it before and would like to share their experiences with understanding the text! I won't summarise or hint at anything related to the story in case someone takes an interest and would like to read it!

Here's a link to the short story if someone wants to give it a try: [https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c](https://gist.github.com/defunkt/759182/ad44c6135d168ae54503a281bb7e1a24c6c2ea0c)

fo2tfy,protopokljof,It is absolutely infuriating to 'read' chunks of dialogue in a different language!,"First of all, I apologize for possible spelling and grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.  


As many others on here, I took up this free time to read through some of the books I have been putting off due to busy schedules and I generally found back all the enjoyment and fun in it! However, the book I'm currently reading, a sequel in a trilogy, takes place in Mexico and huge chunks of dialogue is written in Spanish without any translation or any hint to what the characters are talking about. Basically, the pages keep on looking like this:  


“*Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,*”  Jack said  when  he approached  the  bar.  
“*Donec ac finibus leo, et commodo est?*”  
“*Aenean. At lectus sit amet metus iaculis pharetra quis id nunc.*”  
Jack shook the bartender's hand, squeezed, and raised his brows when the bartender squeezed a little tighter.  
“*Vivamus rhoncus aliquam suscipit.  In eu massa varius, vehicula mi ut, vestibulum ipsum.*”  Jack flexed his hand. “*Duis in laoreet ante!*”  
“*Ut dignissim ex ligula*.”  


For context, the books is written in English but these passages are getting more and more frequent as I'm progressing with the story. I used Google Translate to somewhat get and idea of what is happening, but the fact that I need anther tool to understand the story throws me off completely. Now, I understand that Spanish is one of the most spoken languages in the world, but for all I care it could be any other language, widely spoken, super rare or even imaginary, and it would annoy me just as much. 

Is anyone else also annoyed by these things happening or am I just being too sensitive and whiny? I feel like these dialogues in a foreign language add nothing to the story and I'm sure there are creative ways to write people speaking different language without actually writing in that said different language.",35,1585045324,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fo2tfy/it_is_absolutely_infuriating_to_read_chunks_of/,books,1
fo2myq,predalau,How do you get into philosophy?,"Hey guys! This is my first ever reddit post. I'm a 23 yo CS major, but although I am a sciency person, I have always been attracted by philosophical concepts and I have always tried to critically assess how I live my life versus how I should live it. When I was a kid I tried getting into Nietzsche and I quickly realised that I have no idea what that man was trying to say xD. As I grew up I feel like I am a bit more prepared to get into philosophy, but whenever I tackle a text, I am immediately bombarded by terminology that I am not at all familiar with and page long sentences that I feel are impossible to follow. I guess what I am asking you guys is to refer me to some more simple texts or books that represent a good introduction to all that philosophical terminology.

fo0suk,jaded_cynical_goat,"Just finished reading ""The Awakening"" by Kate Chopin. And I don't understand why people hate it.","This morning I finished reading “The Awakening”, by Kate Chopin.  I had started reading it last night as I am currently engaged in a race to the finish line towards my ambitious reading challenge for Goodreads. “The Awakening”, isn’t a book that was featured on my reading list. It was coughed up from the depths of the inter-webs as I struggled to find a book under 300 pages.  My mind was blessedly unbiased about the book as I had resolved to not even determine its genre before beginning to read it. 

&gt;As I accompanied Edna through the salty sea air of the Grand Isle to her garish dwelling in New Orleans, I commiserated with her loneliness and hopelessness. She was in a love-less marriage, motherhood didn’t have any appeal for her and she had a brief affair with a modern day equivalent of a fuckboy. Throughout the novel, I saw her struggle with the fact that her life was immeasurably unsatisfying and would remain so. It is a universal and timeless tale of a woman with a sheltered upbringing, brought up in privilege and destined to lead a life of domestic conformity!

But I have failed to understand the vitriol which was directed towards her character in the comments section in Goodreads.  People think she’s irredeemable and thoughtless. I simply believe that she (Edna) had virtually no support from society or family to bring any radical changes to her life. She wasn’t equipped to deal with her circumstances and had no way of getting what she wanted. And this realization caused her undoing, because it isn’t possible for anyone to deal with this unpalatable truth.

*Waiting For Death*

I sit around day by day waiting for death.

No, not my own death, though I have wished for that many times,

Waiting to hear of the death of a loved one.

It’s only a matter of time, I know, before this plague takes someone I know.

Maybe not someone very close to me, but someone I have met in my nearly 34 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Why would I be spared, this horrible news?

Why wouldn’t this plague kill one of the essential workers I know?

The minutes turn into hours, then into days,

Time passes by so slowly and yet so fast all at once,

And still I sit, waiting, waiting, for death.

&amp;#x200B;

I think of all the nurses I know, at least ten,

All the grocery workers, utility workers, all of them essential.

Will it be one of them?

When? When can I be spared this torture of waiting.

\-Appeared on dozens of podcasts with a cumulative 1.5+ million listens  
\-Lined up numerous speaking gigs  
\-Grown my personal brand exponentially 

The best part? I spent 0$ on advertising and marketing.

I read a book years ago that was a thriller, if I remember correctly the author is female. 

The book starts off with a girl and her young sister going to live with their aunt in her house in the woods. They meet a strange boy, I remember he was odd there was some kind of mystery around him. The main plot of the book was that the woods ended up being alive or cursed or whatever, and it was soon discovered that they were moving on their own and eventually started consuming the house. The aunt goes crazy and at one point and gives the main character a cake for her birthday that has worms baked into it before laughing hysterically and locking herself in the attic at which point she isn’t really seen again. The book had Slenderman in it too, or an entity based off of Slenderman that I believe was the reason for the woods being all fucky. I never finished the book, but did get to the point where the main character finds out that her and her sister died in the house from sickness/starvation and have actually been dead for most of the book.

Idk if I’ll actually find it but figured it was worth a shot because I liked the author and it’s driving me nuts that I can’t remember her name or the name of the book.",1,1585012256,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fnw1ue/what_book_is_this/,books,1

I started reading a book called ""The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"", which is basically 700 pages of material about web security.
I want to start learning by reading, and I used to read a bit of books in the past but they were way smaller than this one (my biggest book was probably 300 pages), and often I read in my native language which is French, so reading in uncomfortable position was probably easier. 

But with a book like this one, how can I get comfy reading it?
Since I have to learn from it, and even tho my English isn't that bad, it probably doesn't help me much, I have a hard time focusing on it.
Sitting on a average chair, and the book on a table (my head looking down on it), I loose focus super quick. 

Maybe it has nothing to do with my position, and I just have a hard time learning from English book's since it's my first big one, but I still figured I'd ask just in case.

fnve2f,dippy_bear,Imperium by Robert Harris,"After becoming interested in Ancient Rome, I've been hunting down historical fiction about the period. So far I've discovered: **Roma Sub Rosa** and **Roma** (haven't read this one yet) series by Steven Saylor and the fantastic **Masters of Rome** series by Colleen McCullough. I stumbled upon Imperium while browsing B&amp;N.

Imperium focuses on Cicero's rise in politics and is told through the eyes of his slave/secretary Tiro. If you're interested in Ancient Rome and want a book that isn't related to something about war, you might be interested in this book. The politics that Cicero finds himself navigating through can be eerily similar to what you hear about today.

I will say that out of all the authors listed in this post, Harris does the least satisfactory job imo at making the reader feel like they were in Ancient Rome. There are some descriptions of the heat and landscape, but for the most part Harris was more concerned with the political aspect.

fnv9pi,lukejmcgrath,The Great Gatsby,"Alongside The Big Sleep and Wuthering Heights , I was introduced to The Great Gatsby in high school. I wrote an essay about the themes of illusion and reality in both Gatsby and a novel called The Last Resort , which I thoroughly detested. Part of that may have been the incredibly disparity in my instant affection for the former and tedious acceptance of the latter.

Since the first few pages, The Great Gatsby has captivated me like no other novel. It’s followed me through life, giving me a connection and new meaning at almost every turn. Reading it again, I’m back where I began, imagining myself as Gatsby, perhaps through some urge to be the protagonist of my own life, rather than a side character.

Published in 1925, The Great Gatsby was not an instant success, only gaining its status after the author’s death. Following the larger-than-life Jay Gatsby, narrator Nick Carraway describes one summer in 1922 where his and Gatsby’s lives intertwine with tragic consequences.

It almost seems foolish to attempt to review The Great Gatsby, as so much has been written about in the past 90 years. For me, the most enduring reason to praise the novel is the quality of Fitzgerald’s writing. In just over 50,000 words, he creates a great American mythology. Even in just a few hundred pages, no character is underwritten, no image is under-drawn and manage passages take on such lyrical beauty that they might have stretched for ages under the pen of a less-skilled craftsman.

A mysterious and often suspicious character, Gatsby’s story is revealed over the course of the novel through his conversations with Nick and long-lost love for Nick’s cousin Daisy Buchanan. We learn how Gatsby created his own personality, built a life and became rich, all to find a way back to his dream of meeting Daisy again. On the way to trying to recapture the past, he either becomes corrupted or takes on enough rumour that he might as well be.

Sarah Churchwell writes in her essay  The Great Gatsby Delusion , “For Fitzgerald, Gatsby’s vast wealth is a sign of the failure of the American dream, not its success.” Its testament to Fitzgerald’s incredible ability that many miss this reading of the novel. With Gatsby, the story reads you as much as you read it. It can give you hope, but it can also teach you that the means you might need for the ends, make the ends impossible to capture. As Fitzgerald writes of Gatsby, “his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.”

Nevertheless, The Great Gatsby has always given me hope. No matter its message, I have always read it to mean that our dreams are what make us great, not average. It reminds me to dream big, to dream romantic and most of all, just to dream.",9,1585009261,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fnv9pi/the_great_gatsby/,books,1

1. Things like 52 books pretty much discriminate against all longer books. Have you tried reading 900 pages in a week while trying to keep a normal schedule and keep working? Damn near impossible without constant skimming.
2. 1 week isn't enough time to think about and appreciate the average book. Even short books can take time if you're paying attention (Try reading Night by Elie Wiesel, that shit's hard on the heart to read)
3. Bragging about how many books you've read is meaningless because you can say ""I read 83 books last year"" and everyone on these subreddits will suck your dick when in reality you could have read 83 children's books while someone may have read 7 books but they were all massive and hard to read like the Illiad or War and Peace.

Now, to be fair these are all exaggerations to prove a point, I don't hate any subreddit, I just think it's flawed and there are better ways to flaunt your reading capabilities. Might I recommend counting pages?  

By counting pages instead, you can read 9 massive books or 22 little ones and be on the same playing field. It evens the playing field for those with long and short attention spans and allows a reader to really get lost in a book. The most criticism I've heard is ""but it's hard to keep track of pages!!"" It's really not. If you have Reddit, you have access to a calculator. Flip to the back of your books and add the last page numbers up or flip to your bookmark. My personal plan to help me keep track over multiple years is to pile my read books onto one shelf with a line of blue tape up to the ceiling and then every New Years Eve, I draw a line (either at the top of the stack or from where my bookmark is), write the year, and the number of pages and then see if I can beat the record the next year.

It's easier, more reliable, and in the end, better for everyone involved. Feel free to debate me or argue with me, I'm happy to change my ways if this is a bad idea, but I just think it's easier for personal growth.",34,1585005169,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fnu612/want_a_real_accurate_and_fair_way_to_compare/,books,1

I read ""Baby Teeth"" a while ago and I have not been able to get out of my head because of how much I disliked every aspect of the book.

The mom was dumb, (like really dumb) and spineless. I got tired of constantly hearing about her fistula and crohnes disease. She was a hopeless mother without a personality. The Dad was everything i dislike about the ""My child can do now wrong"" type parents. Even when the little girl gets kicked out of like 3 schools for bad behavior he doesn't believe she did anything wrong. Fuck off Dad. 

The ""evil"" girl had conflicting personalities. She called her mom a 'bitch' by writing it down but then for her inner monologue she uses ""baby"" speak. Like ""Mommy made me jelly yum yums"" or something like that. My gripe is, if you have the daughter call her mom 'bitch' then when thinking to herself she's probably going to use profanity too and not think like how we talk to babies.

fnqexf,K1NGMOJO,First book read in 15 years!,"I am going to start by saying that I have never been an avid reader or writer, in my entire life not including grades 8 and below I can only remember reading about 5 books total. All of those 5 books were school related and not for leisure whatsoever, even in my undergrad English and writing courses I read what I had to add to discussions or write an essay.

So, what lead me to reading my first book in my adulthood? I am dealing with severe PTSD and depression. I was self hospitalized in November and just recently I suffered a mental breakdown were I was once again hospitalized. My wife and I have separated and a way for us to communicate is reading the same and leaving notes for each other in the kindle app. Reading has been therapeutic now that I have shut out all outside distractions, I have turned off all my streaming services and disconnected the internet at home as well.

The book we decided to read together was ""The Shining"" by Stephen King. It deals a lot with the internal struggles of the main protagonist dealing with depression, alcoholism and his own demons and his wife that is dealing with keeping her homestead together and divorce as well as protecting her family. This book hit home because we are dealing with coincidentally similar issues.

I have to admit that I have attention issues due to my PTSD and ADHD, I have to reread several paragraphs and pages in order for the information to process but highlighting certain passages helped keep me engaged and having dialogue with my wife with notes certainly helped as well. i have finished the book ahead of schedule so I will be reading a marriage counseling book until she catches up but we plan on reading Dr. Sleep next.

fnp371,TomerTzurx,"Post Emile, or On Education by Jean-Jacque Rousseau","Hello, Usually I don't post things such as this, but this book was a hard work, so I think its appropriate I will write about it a little. I read the book in Hebrew, so don't expect the terms to be accurate. 

This giant, 800 pages book, of the French 18 century Philosopher, is his take on how to raise a child. In Rousseau eyes, the child should be raised in the most ""natural"" way possible, especially early on, but to be eventually a solid and good citizen of the society. Rousseau gives a detailed explanation on a lot of crucial parts of raising a child, and emphasis the importance of the teacher in this system of his. The teacher never leaves the child, he becomes his ""sidekick"" at some point, but only to the child eyes. 

Through the book is mostly about raising a child, a lot of the book is also about the state of society in these days, and the disfunction of the political situation in these times. In this book Rousseau gives a the base for his famous and important piece of literature ""The Social Contract"". In Rousseau eyes, for creating a functional society, which everyone are equal in, it is important that all citizen will have their voice heard, but will be willing to pay their share for spinning the wheel. 

I didn't expect to read this book so fast. I bought it a week ago at second hand, and when held it felt a weird calling to dive into it, then read it in a week. This book holds a lot of my favourite writing of all time, Rousseau writes in such and elegant and attractive ways, and almost every page there is an amazing quote to take (yet, it seems I didn't have one stuck truly in my head. ""Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar"" is a part in book IV the shocked me. Still, this book is not flawless; a lot of Rousseau ideas seems over the top, and I have to say that Part V holds an horrible take on women raising. It is understandable why Rousseau holds his low grading opinions on women in these ages, but it makes the reading be a little absurd at time. 

As a whole, I think Emile is one of the most interesting books I've ever read, and there is a lot to take from this book, not only on child raising, but also about: love, society, nature of humankind, knowledge, compassion. What do you think about my take on the book? What is your take on it? I would love to hear from more people who read the book from top to bottom (as it seems there are not many of them).

An excerpt where the characters are thinking about Persephone, that I think is a reminder of hope with everything going down right now:

""I imagined her struggling her way toward us. She squeezed through black tunnels. She took wrong turns, banged her head against the rocks. Sometimes she gave up in despair and she just lay weeping in the pitch darkness. But she struggled on. She waded through icy underground streams. She fought through bedrock and clay and iron ore and coal, through fossils of ancient creatures, the skeletons of dinosaurs, the buried remains of ancient cities. She burrowed past the tangled roots of great trees. She was torn and bleeding but she kept telling herself to move onward and upward. She told herself that soon she'd see the light of the sun again and feel the warmth of the world again.""

I read it again today and I related to Holden so much even at the age of 24. As a recovering mental health (depression) patient I could feel all his feelings like they were my own. The distrust and disgust you feel for everyone around you, the feeling of running away from everyone and everything, the careless attitude because deep down you feel nothing even matters, the facade you put up of being cool and tough because you're scared they are gonna figure out just how much of a coward you truly are, and a lot of other things I could go on and on about. 

I also liked that in the end he got help and was getting a positive attitude and outlook on life and was actually healing instead of going through with his erratic plans or committing suicide.

fnky67,manamachine,The Sheep Look Up by John Brunner,"I reread this last month, having read it over a decade ago in school, and it hit even harder this time. I can't get it out of my head since we've officially entered pandemic. 

It's not a feel-good story where things get better, so if you're already feeling down this probably isn't great timing. But if you like eerily accurate dystopias and have a bunch of time to kill, I can't recommend it enough.

It was written in the 70s. Brenner describes a dystopian America divided by a corporate ruling class and the rioting poor who've been left behind. Climate change has destroyed much of the water and air quality (particularly in California), a food corporation is suspected of poisoning poor brown and black communities. Things go from bleak to disastrous when an uncurable illness runs rampant across the country. 


Not too spoilery partial Wikipedia summary: 

&gt;! No conclusive evidence of deliberate poisoning is found when, suddenly, a severe epidemic of mutated Escherichia coli affects the United States, millions of people are unable to work and produce food, and water filtering systems are unable to fully remove the bacteria from freshwater – and the authorities must cope with the decision to deliver the discredited Nutripon food to their own country as a much-needed food aid.

By the end of the book, rioting and civil unrest sweep the United States because of poor health, poor sanitation, lack of food, lack of services, ineffectiveness of services (medical, policing), disillusionment with government/companies, oppressive government, high incidence of birth defects (pollution-induced), and other factors; all services (military, government, private, infrastructure) break down.  !&lt;",1,1584974103,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fnky67/the_sheep_look_up_by_john_brunner/,books,1

One of which is about Mr. Nakata and his Cat-finding adventures.

It's safe to that so far at least, those are my favorite parts of the book. Everytime a chapter with Mr. Nakata comes on, I just can't help but picture all of it in a Studio Ghibli style animation with a similar kind of background music as the ones we see in movies like My Neighbour Totoro.

I also recently found some sketches of Kafka on the Shore characters where they're drawn in an anime-like style which just adds up to my Ghibli feeling.

fninci,aphidman,Reading the books from The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"So Alan Moore's comic series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen creates a world in late 19th Century Britain where all characters from literary fiction co-exist. 
Mina Murray, from Bram Stoker's Dracula, is hired to put together a team to protect Britain from any domestic threats. The team include Allan Quatermain, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Griffin the Invisible Man, and Captain Nemo. You may be familiar with the poorly received Sean Connery film from 2003!

Presumably like others I've decided to read as many of the major works that Alan Moore drew from to create his little world. It's a very interesting dive into popular Victorian fiction (and some Jules Verne). You sort of get a sense of various social attitudes of the time.

For example the character Allan Quatermain was a very popular one of his day - aimed at young readers (and the young at heart - particularly men according to the author) yet I'd never heard of him until the film adaptation. Its clear, though, why his stories haven't survived as well as others have since big game animal hunting (think shooting 8 elephants in one go for sport) and general Victorian attitudes to race are prevalent throughout (though, interestingly, he's kind of presented as somewhat 'progressive' in his views - which gives you a weird perspective of what might have been 'progressive' for the average Victorian since a lot of the racial elements are often uncomfortable to read).

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else had tried this and what books should be read to fully appreciate The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen?

So far I've read:

*Dracula* by Bram Stoker

*King Soloman's Mines, Allan Quatermain, Allan's Wife &amp; Other Tales* by H Rider Haggard

*In Search of the Castaways, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, The Mysterious Island (kind of a trilogy)* by Jules Verne

*The Invisible Man* by HG Wells

*The Curious Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde* by Robert Louis Stevenson

*The Mystery of Fu Manchu (The Insidious Fu Manchu - US title)* by Sax Rohmer

*A Study in Scarlet, The Sign of Four, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes* by Arthur Conan Doyle

fnhion,ACardAttack,"The Lions of Al-Rassan, a flawed near masterpiece","I have a weird love/annoyed relationship with this book.  From the start this looked like a book I was going to love through and through.  But ultimately pacing issues and a rushed ending hold it back.  It feels like GGK wanted at least another book, but instead of cutting some of the fat, he left it in there and it really slowed the book down.  

I loved the overall plot and politics.  The main 3 characters were also really great, through Jehane kind of stepped to the side the last quarter of the book.  I really loved Rodrigo and Ammar, and most of the side characters we saw.

My problems though is that GGK would take us to places or people once or twice that we didn't need to see and it would slow the pacing down.  We went across the narrow strait but we didnt need to, or we get a small scene from the queen's fuckboy that really didn't add much because thats about all we saw of that character.

Then as I got to the 80% mark or so I really started wondering how he was going to wrap up all this, and he does it by a time jump in the epilogue.  While I dont think we needed to see everything, I would have liked to have seen more.  We didn't even know who won the final battle until a couple pages into the epilogue and this wasnt the only time where GGK kept the reader in the dark about who won/lost or died for a couple pages.

Overall for me it is a flawed almost masterpiece that if I were his editor I'd tell him to write two books or trim some of the fat.  Still a really good book and I do look forward to reading more of his",2,1584958009,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fnhion/the_lions_of_alrassan_a_flawed_near_masterpiece/,books,1

But this book just feels like it's missing a story to me. I'm about 90 pages in and it just feels boring reading this endless inner monologue that never leads anywhere. I feel like the narrator has said everything he's going to say about Wertheimer. I read the plot on Wikipedia and everything on there has already been said in the first half of the book.

fngy00,sinsandtonic,Finished reading “One Billion Customers” by James Mcgregor,"This book is about how China went from Communism to embracing Capitalism, and how China is still ruled by its ancient culture and Confucian Philosophy. China is undergoing the raw capitalism of the Robber Baron era of the late 1800s; the speculative financial mania of the 1920s; the rural-to-urban migration of the 1930s; the emergence of the first-car, first-home, first-fashionable clothes, first-college education, first-family vacation, middle-class consumer of the 1950s, and even aspects of social upheaval similar to the 1960s.

All major reforms, from farming to housing to finance and privatization, were tested and refined as local experiments before being spread nationwide and surrounded with regulatory structures. Mao’s revolution has turned into an entrepreneurial frenzy that is gripping the country. The classmates and alumni greeting and snapping photographs of one another are China’s new revolutionaries. They often used the lure of China’s huge market to persuade foreigners to provide technology, capital, and training.",0,1584954643,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fngy00/finished_reading_one_billion_customers_by_james/,books,1

fnguw6,runi2387,"Read the book first, or watch the movie adaptation first?","I just recently read The House With A Clock In Its Walls, and I had to say, I was quite disappointed with the movie adaptation. Mind you, I watched the movie first, so it kinda weirded me out that the image from movie doesn't really fit into what I'm reading.

However, when I watched Harry Potter movies, I enjoyed the movie a lot, even though the movie omitted some scenes / plots that I wish to see in irl, however for me it's okay, because I have read the books first, so I can put in the pieces myself with the help of imagination with the actors' faces.

This year, there are a lot of book to movie adaptations that I would really like to watch : Artemis Fowl, Emma, Secret Garden, just to name a few.

fngr7o,itsFlycatcher,Struggling with a reading slump/demotivation due to current events - anyone else feel the same? :/,"Apologies if this is not the right place to post this! Just... looking for kindred spirits who wouldn't look at me funny for this. :)

I'm normally a pretty consistent reader. I read primarily on my commute (it's difficult otherwise with a full time job), and mostly have two books going at the same time- one of which I have a physical copy, and one as an ebook on my phone, so that I can just whip it out when I have a minute to spare. And I loved it. Since my job is admittedly unfulfilling and monotonous (what I do can best be summed up as the ungodly, underpaid fusion of a legal clerk and a post office lady), it felt nice to always have something else to do, and it made me feel accomplished- if not in my professional life, then at least in my hobby.

In February (probably my most successful month since I've begun monitoring my reading \~3 years ago), I knocked out 12 books (a total of 3.4k pages), most of them I really enjoyed. And I was SO PROUD of myself, and looking forward to my March reading- with that pace, I thought I was going to reach my yearly goal of 52 books by mid-May.

Then the virus hit my country on March 4th. And I stopped reading.... anything, pretty much. Besides the news, empty assurances from corporate (last month I was promised a raise, bonuses, and more- that's most likely totally out the window now, and my hours have been cut from 8 to 7 a day by pushing back opening hours- ofc I still get home at 6 pm), and everyone's panicked posts about cases popping up in distressing proximity, I just couldn't bring myself to read more than a few pages at a time. I found myself using my ""me time"" on the bus to just... sit with a book in my lap, and stare listlessly out the window.

Between Feb. 29 and March 21, I've started and put down one book I just *couldn't get into* (after about 250 pages) and dragged my feet on another (that I'm still not done with), finished one book that I didn't much like, and after that, on the 22nd, I managed to finish (and enjoy) a short novel. But that was it. All month, I found myself with long, empty hours at my hands, and nothing could keep me engaged.

I'm not really looking for tips on how to start again (I feel better now, somewhat, getting back on track a little with a re-read as the initial shock of the situation kinda tapers off and bleeds into the mundane), just... I guess I'd like to hear if I'm alone with feeling too stressed to read, and in turn, just becoming more stressed by it?

fnf911,Frogpacc,How do I read a particularly dense book?,"I've recently gotten back into my classical history, and have been reading everything I can on Ancient Rome and Greece. While reading I picked up on the philosophy of Stoicism. I since shifted from classic history to classic philosophy a few weeks ago, Stoicism in particular for the moment. I've been told that the best books for learning Stoicism is *Letters from a stoic,* by Seneca, *Meditations,* by Marcus Aurelius and *Discourses and selected readings,* by Epictetus. I decided to start with Seneca and quickly grabbed a copy of his letters from my local book store. 

So far I'm loving Stoicism. Seneca makes many wise and thought provoking points on many aspects of life. However there is one problem, Seneca drops loads of philosophy very fast, and he is not particularly well organized. His book is ( Supposedly ) a compilation of letters he wrote to his friend Lucilius. Any one letter is not particularly long, and he has a lot to say in each. Some letters have several amazing quotes and new ideas in just one paragraph, and often the very next paragraph will be about something else entirely. In the first letter, half is him giving his friend advice on how to stay focused on his studies, and the other half is him quoting Epicurus on poverty; and the letter after that is on friendship. 

With what little I've dabbed into *Meditations*, it feels like most Stoic philosophy is written in this dense and chaotic manner. I'm worried that if I read too much at a time I will get mixed up, and miss out on most of what he has to say. So far I've been treating his book like a series of daily proverbs. Picking out one letter, or one part of a letter, and reflecting on it throughout the day; seeing how I could apply it to my life. However, spending a whole day reflecting on a single paragraph takes forever, and often dips into the time and energy I would otherwise devote to my language studies.

Is this a bad way to read it? Am I going about this in the wrong way? Is this just what it takes to adopt a philosophy rather than just learn about it? I would really appreciate some advice on how to comprehend dense material like this; and how I can make sense of a book with chaotic pacing like this.

fner5q,pmifabookhurtyou,Please help me find the book that drugged me.," To preface. Everything I'm about to type is going to be the first time I typed it in an effort to prove to my girlfriend that I am not crazy (she's the first person I've told). If I can find the book I can prove I'm not crazy. The one who knew where the books were was my grandfather who was too sick to move them by the time this happened.

 Ok so in general, I have terribly atypical neurology, so I'm kind of wired to forget everything if it's not presented a certain way just from being overloaded with stimulus. If I read it, I remember it, I remember what I see. I was 4 when this happened. I had not yet developed my ability to read enough to remember the exact content or plot, just enough that I can place myself reading it many times with my grandfather.

 This book was about a toy, looked like a boyish version of a 1700's magistrate, with maybe a wheel or two wooden legs. Square body unlike Pinnochio. It had a blue hat, I believe.

 I don't want to type this out and take forever because I truly believe this happened so heres the I'm shitting myself tl;dr:

 Wooden boy bound me and carried me around the room while my mom salted the ground, my grandmother took her vitamins, and my grandfather stared out the window. Mom begging ""please"", and a music box played? kind of like the metal fork one my grandmother owns but different song?

 Signs this was not a dream:

1. My father was not there, he had shipped off to Iraq a couple days before.

2. I was drugged with what I 15 years later found out was xanax, which my grandmother had been prescribed for 20 years, I found out last year that she held the script that long. I found out because to ""bartards"" no other benzo will do. Xanax makes you feel very different from many other benzodiazepines. The two feelings were identical.

3. My fucking memories of the book. The months of buildup and comfort and history surrounding the book, and I'm fucked to remember the plot.

4. I went to look for the book a couple months later after my grandfather had passed away to read with my grandmother. It wasn't fucking there, dude.

After some introspection after pushing it out of my mind frantically for 16 years I actually thought about it, 3 things come to mind.

1. Picture book maybe printed on cardboard, may not have had words at all.

2. Little wooden boy with blonde hair/sailor boy/magistrate, with either wooden legs or wheel.

3. Maybe printed in the 90's?

4. One scene the boy is on a picnic, or by a haystack, or in a field.

5. Setting is maybe 1600's.

Please like don't downvote me to the insane asylum, just like take 5 seconds and google anything that comes to mind because maybe you can find something that I didn't, and if a book did the same to you please corroborate me.",1,1584941973,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fner5q/please_help_me_find_the_book_that_drugged_me/,books,1
fneqcb,wander-and-wonder,Which books have you read and been pleasantly surprised at how much you learnt from the book? (Non-fiction or factual fiction),"I am referring to authors who have somehow managed to write educational or informative books in a way that is enjoyable and memorable, and teaches so much in the process of reading.

I put the book down after finishing it and genuinely felt that I had learnt so so much that I actually remember. I was so informed on many things I had no clue I was so uneducated on.

fneo5g,MasterofDMing,"I Saw What That Other Guy Posted About ""The Way of Kings"" and Thought I Could Voice the Same Opinion for the Wheel of Time series","I've personally never understood the love for the series. I know a lot of people love it, but when I picked it up with expectations for it to be a ""better"" version of the Lord of the Rings I was sorely disappointed. I too am not a stranger to fantasy, but I was in the hankering mood for something like LotR and the WoT fell woefully short. Everything about it, the Aes Sedai, the Aragorn-like warrior, the 4 guys from the village, felt like a rip-off, and not a good one. There was no originality, no changes in any way to the basic underlying plot of LotR, and for all those reviews I read about how the world building was better than LotR, I completely disagree (trollocs? Really?). Every town felt the same, the same words to describe things got old (oh ma lawd did I get tired of Rand and... that other guy's road trip by themselves as they just hopped from town to town). Nothing was explained and everything was just so confusing. And there is no language that Robert Jordan came up with, so that kinda defeats any  claims of a ""richer world.""   


Btw I'm not a purist, and actually have been thinking about giving it another shot, but goodness does it drag.

fneiiu,MarxistLeninism2050,I'm having a hard time understanding the vampires from I Am Legend,"There are two kinds of vampires, the living and the dead. The dead ones are easy to understand, an infect person dies and becomes a mindless monster. It is the living vampires I am having trouble with.

"" A cloud of silent heat was suspended over everything on Cimarron Street. Virginia Neville’s heart had stopped. He sat beside her on the bed, looking down at her white face.""

From this quote, it is clear that the bacteria killed her, and their is nothing that suggests that she was violent, as she was left in his house. It isn't until after she died that she became monsterous.

But earlier on he was testing sunlight on a living vampire, and said this:

 ""All right, she’s suffering, he argued with himself, but she’s one of them and she’d kill me gladly if she got the chance.""

This implies that the living vampires were violent and bloodthirsty, even before they died. So why did Virginia die peacefully while others become bloodthirsty?

&amp;#x200B;

""“Ben,” he said loudly.  “Ben, I need your car.” They were in the bedroom, silent and still in their daytime comas, lying apart on the twin beds, Ben in pajamas, Freda in silk nightgown; lying on the sheets, their thick chests faltering with labored breaths  He stood there for a moment looking down at them.  There were some wounds on Freda’s white neck that had crusted over with dried blood""

 ""It’s Ben, he heard his mind offering.  He’s come for the car keys.""

This confuses me more so. From the first paragraph, its clear that they are infect as they were in day comas, and it looks like Ben had feed on his wife. But in the next paragraph Robert seemly expected Ben to be able to come and ask for his car keys back. This is after the government ordered people to burn the dead, so it is not like Robert doesn't understand what is going on. 

""While he was drying himself, he suddenly realized that he didn’t know what portion of the vampires who came nightly were physically alive and what portion were activated entirely by the germ.  Odd, he thought, that he didn’t know.  There had to be both kinds, because some of them he shot without success, while others had been destroyed.  He assumed that the dead ones could somehow withstand bullets""

So living vampires were apparently feral and coming for his blood alongside the dead vampires.

“Listen to me,” he said then.  “I have every reason to suspect you of being infected.  Especially now that you’ve reacted in such a way to garlic.” She said nothing. “Haven’t you anything to say?” he asked. She raised her eyes. “You think I’m one of them,” she said. “I think you might be.” “

So apparently living vampires could pass themselves off as humans in terms of behavior

“I know,” he said.  “I know the germ, know how it multiplies.  No matter how long their systems fight it, in the end the germ will win.  I’ve made antibiotics, injected dozens of them.  But it doesn’t work, it can’t work.  You can’t make vaccines work when they’re already deep in the disease.  Their bodies can’t fight germs and make antibodies at the same time.  It can’t be done, believe me.  It’s a trap.  If I didn’t kill them, sooner or later they’d die and come after me.  I have no choice; no choice at all.” 

This implies that the reason he is killing them is not because they are monsters, but that they will die and become monsters.

 ""Bacteria can mutate."" 

Is this saying that vampires who are intelligent are so because a mutation in the bacteria is allowing them to be?

I think he goes to live with his grandfather who is trying to protect him and then he sneaks out of his house. I also remember him going to some place where he has to fight some spider girl and he beats her. He also finds out he has a brother or something.

fnapfh,EmilyamI,Octavia Butler,"I've read two books by this author (well, one and I'm halfway through a second), and while I feel I would really like the writing otherwise, I keep getting hung up on one bit that is in both books: they both feature children in sexual, romantic relationships with adults.

In one of them, the main character is a 15-16 year old girl who enters a relationship with a 50-60 year old man. In the other, the main character is a 10-11 year old girl in a relationship with a man in his early 20s.

Now, I'm not into censorship in literature, and I know sometimes uncomfortable topics are used for a reason, but the repetition of this particular issue and the way it is presented (it's ""okay"" for the 15-16 year old because she has choice and is mature for her age, and it's ""okay"" for the 10-11 year old because she only LOOKS 10-11 but is actually much older) that rubs me the wrong way. Hell, the early 20s man makes jokes about jailbait and having to hide the 10-11 year old from his parents, and the 50-60s guy questions his morals in sleeping with a minor. It's presented in the kind of ""love is love, age is just a number, society is wrong and judgemental"" way that some pedophiles use to try to justify sexual relationships with minors.

Has anybody else who has read her work felt the same way about her books? The topics and writing are right up my alley, but I can't even enjoy the book I'm in the middle of because every other chapter an adult is having sex with a woman with the (oft described) body of a ten-year-old.

I started reading yesterday afternoon and I could not put it down. This book went from 0-100 in the first 15 pages and it never let up. I'm a big fan of dramatized retellings of historical events so it's not surprising that I was so captivated by the book. But even for a book like this, the horrific descriptions of the ebola virus' symptoms and the following of the first few outbreaks in Africa were nightmare fuel and I had to keep going just to find out how it all played out for peace of mind if anything else.

The story is largely about the outbreak of the ebola Reston strain, which was found in monkeys just outside of DC and (history spoilers) it turns out that it doesn't actually affect humans, though people can still carry the disease. Despite the disease not affecting humans, the book did a good job of convincing me that it was still not to be taken lightly and does an amazing job at conveying the fear and urgency in the moment of discovering and containing an unknown infection.

fn9aoy,Gordoth,Journeys in Fantasy - How do you do them?,"Hello, folks. 

I'm in the process of writing a book, and, coincidentally, it is a work of fiction set in a world that can be characterized as fantasy. Things have been going well, but I have come face-to-face with a great beast that is evading my proverbial blade.

That is, as you can guess, the Journey. Now, of course, I do not mean the journey in a more figurative manner, which one could associate with ''The Hero's Journey'', but rather a more literal manner - the process of getting from point A to point B. 

I'd say it is traveling, the way characters do it and how detailed I want it to be, versus how detailed it should be. I write with an inclination for hyper-detail, or, at the very least, an amount of details that is above average, and could lead into the belief that the works I am creating are heavy, slow pieces of literature. I write in that manner because I wish to assist the reader with experiencing the exact emotion that I intended, I want them to glean the meaning that I sought to impart, I want them to envision the world as I imagined it.

I have been doing that for quite a while, and, so far, it has been going relatively well, in this work of fiction, yet I came to a halt.

The main character recently met another character, and they set off to travel to a destination. There is a pressing urgency forcing them to move quickly, and that makes me think I should, how do I say it, ''skim'' through the process of traveling from point A to point B, so as to make it appear quick, which is the goal of the characters - to reach the destination quickly. 

\*Keep in mind this takes place in the first quarter of the book, on the dawn of the second quarter, and I feel as if I have already had quite enough time to do world building and to establish relevant characters for the immediate plot.

One thing I could do is focus on the interactions between the characters, as they have only just recently met, and make their blooming friendship more believable, but, already, there is as much dialogue between the two of them as there is between any other characters in the book, combined, and I'm at more than 50k words, which makes me believe their chemistry has already been established and their friendship is believable.

Another thing I can do is focus on the world and build upon it, but introducing some encounters that make the setting more believable and sensible at the expense of sacrificing the sense of urgency does not appeal to me at all, and, as I previously stated, I think I have missed the opening for ""world building"" in my book.

Would it be plausible to go off and utilize a time-skip, or would that scarcity of information and detail stand in a stark contrast with the rest of the book and stick out like a sore thumb?

I've read plenty of books, many of which about journeys. Instantly, what comes to mind is ""The Hobbit"", or even the ""Lord of the Rings"", but I feel as if the Journey in my book is a lot more isolated, a lot more personal than those grand quests. Sure, the trip Bilbo takes is, arguably, personal and small in comparison to what the Fellowship undertakes in the ""Lord of the Rings"", but there are still vast amounts of treasure, Kings, Dragons and armies involved. 

The purpose of the Journey in my book, or, at least the one I am struggling with, is to have a brother find his sister. Very small, very personal, not at all grand scale.

I tried to think of other examples of Journeys, but they are all large scale, massive - that could be the medium of fantasy, which is what I am most acquainted with. One example outside of fantasy, and into Science Fiction that I can think of is ""Eternity Road"", but the type of Journey in that book is not nearly as urgent or specific as what I am going for, being far similar to an exploratory search for something with an unproven existence, ala El Dorado.

By no means is this Journey the main focus of my book, but I feel as if it is important, because the events leading up to it, and it, by itself, are driving factors into the way I seek to have the main character become a ""hero"" and complete the more abstract ""Hero's Journey"".

I realize this is not all that cohesive a post, but please, I implore you, help me! Do ask questions that would clarify things and help you if you do wish to assist, but feel a bit lost in the dribbles of thought that I've barfed up onto Reddit.

Near the end of the book when Franz travels to Asia to help the doctors get into Cambodia, the protestors are met with silence at the border. Is this an example of “lightness” because the border guard does not care?

I feel like I'm reading a diferent book to everyone else tbh. It feels like the kind of stuff 13 year old me would have found ""pretty cool"", but nowadays I just don't see the point in reading it. It feels ""artificial"", and safe, as if Sanderson wrote down what feels like the equivalent of a Marvel movie. Entertaining at times, with an ambitious setting and background for every detail of the world, but it never gets me. There is nothing about the book I could love. It feels like a shounen anime where everyone is taken very seriously and has some ""serious power"" and every fight is to prove how amazingly amazing they are. And the dialogues are just... they are. As if Sanderson hadn't really thought about what he was going for other than delivering the necessary information. I'm also not even a fan of swords fights in books to begin with, unless they are well written and, well...

The worldbuilding is ambitious and detailed, as I've said, and that's as much praise as I can give it. The rest is... fine. Sometimes a bit annoying, but mostly just fine.

fn7x76,kHartos,Tribe by Sebastian Junger is a great book to read right now,"I’ll start with a quote directly from the book:  
&amp;nbsp;

*Humans don’t mind hardship, in fact they thrive on it; what they mind is not feeling necessary. Modern society has perfected the art of making people not feel necessary. It's time for that to end.*  
&amp;nbsp;

I was completely captivated by this book through-out. Junger takes a complicated topic - societal cohesion and self-worth - and writes lucidly on it. The book spends a lot of time on how we deal with crisis, both individually and as a group, and it has me feeling better about current crisis we find ourselves. Not at a national level, but at a family and community level. We are meant for crisis. As hunter gatherers we bounced from crisis to crisis and our ability to thrive in it, or in spite of it, is a defining part of who we are. In fact after reading this book it is easy to come to the conclusion that the absence of true crisis is what has led to many of our societal ills today. I’ll end with a few more quotes from the book:  
&amp;nbsp;

* The public is often accused of being disconnected from its military, but frankly it's disconnected from just about everything. Farming, mineral extraction, gas and oil production, bulk cargo transport, logging, fishing, infrastructure construction—all the industries that keep the nation going are mostly unacknowledged by the people who depend on them most.*  
&amp;nbsp;
* What would you risk dying for—and for whom—is perhaps the most profound question a person can ask themselves. The vast majority of people in modern society are able to pass their whole lives without ever having to answer that question, which is both an enormous blessing and a significant loss*
&amp;nbsp;
* How do you become an adult in a society that doesn’t ask for sacrifice? How do you become a man in a world that doesn’t require courage?*",8,1584913605,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fn7x76/tribe_by_sebastian_junger_is_a_great_book_to_read/,books,1

I would like him to read philosophy but it would have to be at a level and style that a smart 14 year old would enjoy.

fn7e0m,lukejmcgrath,Bonjour Tristesse,"As with The Lost Honour of Katherina Blum, Bonjour Tristesse and Francoise Sagan were unknown to me before I began my reading challenge. Similarly to Heinrich Boll’s novel, discovering another non-English novel has been a delight and feels well overdue.

Since writing out my list of books I’d like to read, the title of this novel has stuck in my mind, despite never seeing it before. The superficial link in my limited memory is to La Tristesse Durera, a track by the Manic Street Preachers that takes its own title from the reported last words of Vincent van Gogh, “the sadness will last forever.”

With the title lodged rather firmly in my head, I happened upon an old copy of the novel at Tynemouth Book Fair (well worth a visit) and bought it for a few pounds, knowing nothing about it. The cover features a young girl that’s more than reminiscent of the 1928 film The Passion of Joan of Arc. On further reading, the edition I found is from 1974 and was translated by Irene Ash.

Written when Sagan was just a teenager, Bonjour Tristesse would remain popular throughout and beyond Sagan’s life, with all future works inevitably compared to her first novel. The book was filmed in 1958 and released to a middling response at the time, but has since grown in stature.

The plot of Bonjour Tristesse is little more than a short story. It follows the thoughts and manipulations of a girl, Cecile, spending the summer with her father and two women competing for his affections. Fearing the end of her easy life when one woman stakes her claim on her father, Cecile plans to end the relationship.

The great success of the novel is not the slight plot, but the atmosphere Sagan builds within the mind of Cecile. Her desperation to cling on to what was already a quite soulless lifestyle and the lengths she will go to make for a strange mix of understanding and pity. It’s easy to connect with Cecile, even when her actions go beyond our own experience, simply because they are such human actions.

Reading the novel, a nagging familiarity played in my mind and it was only in researching this review that I understood what it was. As Richard William’s writes in The Guardian, Sagan’s “acceptance of melancholy [is] more reminiscent of F Scott Fitzgerald than of her French literary heroes.” It is, as is The Great Gatsby, a short and sad tale.

Easily readable in a single sitting, Bonjour Tristesse is an enjoyable piece of mood literature. Its depiction of the depressing lengths some will go to to protect even a sad life is perfectly written and captures brilliantly the energy and misery of youth.",1,1584911731,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fn7e0m/bonjour_tristesse/,books,1
fn78oh,lukejmcgrath,A Clockwork Orange,"A Clockwork Orange was the first, and to date only, novel I’ve read in a single sitting. I can’t remember why, but I was staying at my grandparents’ house for a few nights, perhaps home from university. For some reason, I found myself with a copy of the book and dove into one night, finishing it several hours later at 3am.

Divided into three parts, A Clockwork Orange, follows the story of Alex, a young and violent man who spends his evenings taking part in “ultra-violence”, beating, maiming and raping with his gang of three “droogs”. Caught and sentenced to jail, Alex is subjected to an experimental treatment which removes his free will and makes even the thought of violence turn his stomach.

The novel is one of a select few where it’s impossible to choose a true highlight, indeed it’s the perfection of the whole that makes A Clockwork Orange so successful. The prose is tight, explosive and yet works away at subtler themes than it often gets credit for. Of course, there’s free will under scrutiny, but so too is government interference, youth culture, violence, prisons and religion.

While the prose shines, it is often the narration that many remember, spurred on by Burgess’ nadsat, a language compounded from Russian, rhyming slang and pure invention, oh my brothers. Alex, our humble narrator, is the voice of his generation. He’s an anarchist, intellectual and philosopher rolled into the malevolent heartbeat of a disconnected teenager. He delights in violence and crime, despises authority, but you often sense is just a little too bright to truly believe he can last forever that way.

Martin Amis, in his 2012 essay on A Clockwork Orange, rightly celebrates the almost whisp-like nature of the novel:

“It is a book that can still be read with steady pleasure, continuous amusement and — at times — incredulous admiration.”

Like Amis, my main reaction the novel has always been a sense of wonder at the sheer perfection Burgess accomplished. Written in just three weeks, the book reads as if it was born in a storm of white-hot but short-lived fire. No other novel I know of better captures its tone, story and meaning in so few words. Perhaps The Great Gatsby is the closest in terms of creating a single, atmospheric story. Yet even Fitzgerald rests his novel from time to time. Burgess, you sense, did not blink.",45,1584911211,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fn78oh/a_clockwork_orange/,books,1
fn6wdr,Earthbound-123,The codex Seraphianus analysis,"Introduction 

The writings scattered in lines like an ancient text on this linen manuscript but indecipherable as it is the work of an unintelligible hand and alienated script. This codex written by an artist who wrote the alien text for meaning and a purpose within these pages. The drawings in pen and colored pencil. The surrealism I stepped into like something impossible to describe like the images and drawings of people having sex and transforming down to an alligator, they fuse and the alligator leaves the page. As well as the images of cultural life in this world that I flip the pages of this valuable and rare book and I see the incomprehensible words of recurring letters that are a mere squiggle that twists and turns over and over in some words and phrases as if the and artistic drawings and lines are an actually described language but of ancient alien origin. 

   On my 11th birthday on the day of Halloween 2018, I remember a book sitting on the table and it said on the white cover, *Codex Seraphinanus.* I smiled widely as kept turning turning the pages of this incredibly strange book. I always wanted this piece of manuscript as the words fascinated and captivated my largely intelligent mind. The rare and valuable encyclopedia that goes up on the market in the near hundreds, the book of insanity about a imaginary world that exists without are comprehension. The edition I received was around 1-200 United States dollars and the highest goes up to the rarity of 5000 dollars. 

I

   The world expressed here in this encyclopedia is separated in parts about the world that doesn't exist then tells about the climate and the fona and flora only told through the pictures that were a distorted and twisted versions of earth's fona and flora, the hybrids of fruits and vegetables mashed into distortion like the image of a yellow banana with its skin pealed and exposing the fruit's flesh but around the mid body of the flesh exists a translucent pocket like glass filled with pills like a pill bottle. 

   Colorful plants that grow into chairs and people wait with herbal seeds to grow them in buildings for people to sit down shown in an image of one of the natural plant having its twigs shaved off and sawed down to smoothness with the twigs and shavings sitting on the checker-pattern red and white floor with scissors sitting with the broken twigs and shavings. 

   The world has many different races of people with chapters dedicated to the culture of the races of many varieties from the hairy to the white race. All races from different parts of the world and with different cultures with food and pictures of chefs preparing strange and revolting food that a lady slurps up with a straw from a plate of solid goo. Houses compacted around ally ways and streets with a dark turn, satellite stands made of human bones like a femur bone and arm bones tied together with red rope with it did people kill one another to make these and put them on top of the side of their house?  The page as well holding an image of a skeleton holding up a soup of brown sludge with a bone sticking out of it to the side as the skeleton seemingly dances around with the soup in hand. 

   Parades held to mysterious beings that look like walking yarn balls heading down a carpeted path as people watch in cheer surrounding the red carpet in which the walking being walks on with a man falling to his knees and crossing his fingers withholding respect possibly like this is a very important person they worship like a god. Other people either take off their hats and put it to their chest's as they bow down or sometimes cheer with flags held in the air with the same language the book is written in on the flags they wave in the background. 

   The book shows different animals that are so incomprehensibly surreal that it seams like that of a drawn sculpture of a schizophrenic. 

My most favorite page is laid out on my desk to this page on display as the book is my prized possession that I share so much gratitude for it belonging in my ownership showing off its beauty, the pages of surreal art and grotesque figures and cultures and the unreal. The page open up showing off its glory of 3 men with hats of mushrooms and long, red robes with cowboy boots on with a spindle on their black boot's heels as they skin the flesh and meat of a person off its bones like there was zipper on its skin to easily pull the skin off. Skeletons sit on chairs in the white background overlooking the operation and seemingly are making new people from dead ones because of the two people sitting down with mirrors in their hands looking at themselves in true fascination, their back stitched up with twine and put into a knot by their thighs. 

   This treasure I keep is like a rare artifact to me and in essence, you may not think the same because beauty of perspective is subjective. 

   Even though the book is expensive, buying a copy will be worth wile.",9,1584910049,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fn6wdr/the_codex_seraphianus_analysis/,books,1

fn3tju,gogogarl,Board Books for Babies (And Their Parents),"My son is almost a year old and reading is one of our daily activities. I've found a lot of board books to be hit or miss, and when I search for recommendations online, it seems to be the same ones listed over and over again. There's nothing wrong with the classics, but I've found some gems from the last decade or so.

For the first couple of months, the only board books he really showed an interest in were ones with pictures of babies, such as ""Play"" by Elizabeth Verdick, or ones with high contrast images, like ""Hello, Bugs!"" by Smriti Prasadam. I actually used that time to read my own novels out loud to him, haha.

Once he became interested in the pictures, I started collecting more board books. One of my early favourites was ""Here Babies, There Babies"" by Nancy Cohen. I love the rhythmic flow, and the illustrations are detailed enough that I can still point out things of interest to him now. I was gifted ""Snuggle Puppy"", ""Barnyard Dance"", and ""Pajama Time"" by Sandra Boynton. I made up silly tunes for them, so they became pretty fun to read and always make him smile.

""Sing a Song of Mother Goose"" by Barbara Reid is a good choice too. With the help of YouTube, I learned all the nursery rhymes in the book. If we go for a long drive, I sing through them to entertain him. ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" by Jane Cabrera is my husband's favourite to read/sing because he already knows the tune, and the illustrations are cute. For the same reason, I also enjoy ""Hush Little Baby"" by Sylvia Long.

We have quite a few touch-and-feel books, but the one that stands out is ""Good Night Farm"" by Patricia Hegarty. It's a little more expensive than typical board books, but totally worth it. The art is beautiful, the textures are high quality, and I really like reading it. It's now my go-to baby shower gift. Our son also likes the ""Really Feely"" series by DK.

He started enjoying lift-the-flap books around 5 months, and still plays with them now. ""Where Is Baby's Belly Button?"" by Karen Katz is the one he chooses the most. Unfortunately, most flaps are delicate, and he's strong enough now to rip them off. ""Where's the *Animal*?"" series by Nosy Crow have felt flaps, which are a little easier to lift, and so far have not been destroyed.

My current favourite is ""All of Baby, Nose to Toes"" by Victoria Adler. It's another catchy rhyme book, and the illustrations are so sweet.

I'm always on the lookout for new books to share with him, so I'd love some input!",21,1584899707,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fn3tju/board_books_for_babies_and_their_parents/,books,1

The very next chapter you're encouraged to rejoice in your faith and see the Divine beauty among all living imperfections. I can't imagine how one person could write this without being emotionally tortured (self-lacerated, if you will). Perhaps it is a form of self-laceration for both the writer and reader. I am a Catholic so I want to know does this book have the same effect among all faiths or is it merely of intellectual value for those who are not religious?

The book left me feeling strangely alright with the end of humanity. The book is, as Slate reviewer Rebecca Onion calls it, an anti-survival story.

fn0tjk,julesisacoward,The Song Of Achilles Is One Of The Greatest Books I’ve Read,"Hey everyone! Today I just wanted to share my thoughts on a book by Madeline Miller that I just finished an hour ago. Now granted, my emotions could be ruling me right now but I just wanted to share my thoughts and opinions with you all, so I don’t forget key things I want to talk about.

First off, I just want to say that I’m not an avid reader, but when I find a good book I can’t put it down until I’ve pretty much read the whole thing. Second, the reason that I picked up this book is that I am a sucker for pretty much anything related to Greek Mythology and when I saw that Madeline Miller’s books were on sale I couldn’t help myself with buying a few. And lastly - I know the outline of The Iliad &amp; The Odyssey, but I don’t think I’ve seen a good modern reimagining/retelling of these 2 in particular but I had heard only good things until I read it. 

Anyways to the point, after the Great Gatsby and a couple others highly emotional stories I don’t think a book has captivated me so much. After every chapter I just WANTED to know more. Not to mention the writing style - I don’t even know how to properly describe it... it’s almost ethereal. How the author meshes the old-timey dialogue with modern descriptions and words. It works so well.

I really don’t know how she did it but Miller made me care even for the side-characters, like a lot. I couldn’t help but feel (we are getting into spoiler territory now, proceed with caution) sad for Iphigenia &amp; Briseis, for their demises and for their helplessness. I fell in love with the world building, I wanted to visit Chiron’s Hut, I wanted to explore Odysseus’ ship, wanted to even experience the city of Troy behind the stone walls. 

Now for the grand finale - HUGE SPOILERS FOR THE FINAL CHAPTERS. I highly recommend reading the book, before referring to this paragraph of my review. Anyways last warnings out of the way - Patroclus’ death broke Achilles (&amp; me). From a cheerful, but stoic warrior he became a vengeful shadow of his former self. He even battled a GOD (of a river, but still). The last few pages really got me emotional - especially the exchange between Thetis &amp; Patroclus where he redeems himself in her eyes. (Also the fact that Pyrhus died somehow got me satisfied, as he was a little tyrant). His name finally rested next to Achilles’ one and they reunited in the afterlife - ashes to ashes...

Pick up this book. Do yourself this favour. I am starting Circe in the next few days and I can/probably will post a similar review then. But yeah - read this masterpiece.

fmzxs9,iPayTheTrollToll,How current world situation is analogous to a Stephen King novel,"TL;DR  - At the highest level, power claws for more power and this 1000+ page novel elucidates the ways in which that power may seek to sustain itself in the midst of this pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished my quarantined reading of Under the Dome by Stephen King and I kept thinking of how what I was reading mirrored the reality I am seeing today.

&amp;#x200B;

In the book a town get's quarantined under an invisible dome. The de-facto leader of the town, Big Jim, is a brute who claims his actions are God's will. He will do anything to gain more power, even if it means the town remains stuck under the dome. I relate this to President Trump printing money and giving it as a one-time bailout in this months-long pandemic. It's so obviously ineffective, the only benefit that will result is for the people involved (and future campaign contributions I'm sure).

&amp;#x200B;

In order to have an excuse to wrest control from the people, Big Jim instigates a riot at a grocery store where looting and other base behaviors ensue (and blames it on his opponents). I relate this to a possible strategy from the current people in charge (whether it be city, state or federal level), where  actions are NOT taken to diminish chaos and disorder and (pessimistically) generated in order to enact new, powerful legislative actions that ostensibly ameliorate the social-problem (but really helps those that passed the ""executive order"").

&amp;#x200B;

While Under the Dome's power dynamic, according to King, was meant to resemble Bush-Cheney power dynamics, the fundamental political system remains the same. At the highest level, power claws for more power and this 1000+ page novel elucidates the ways in which that power may seek to sustain itself in the midst of this pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

""We note that the Library has not had a fire drill for the last two hundred years. This is because we found the two default responses unhelpful.

fmydxo,DelFrigus,Why do old books have far longer sentences?,"Anyone know why sentences in older stories/books are so long?

Alice in Wonderland (1865) by Lewis Carroll’s first two sentence:

&gt; ALICE was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice, “without pictures or conversations?”

&gt; So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

Emma (1815) by Jane Austen’s first three sentences:

&gt; Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.

&gt; She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most af- fectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister’s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very ear- ly period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as gov- erness, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.

But if I look at popular modern books:

The Hunger Games (2008)

&gt; When I wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. My fingers stretch out, seeking Prim’s warmth but finding only the rough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad dreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. This is the day of the reaping.

&gt; I prop myself up on one elbow. There’s enough light in the bedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her side, cocooned in my mother’s body, their cheeks pressed together. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not so beaten-down. Prim’s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely as the primrose for which she was named. My mother was very
beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me.

Maze runner (2009)

&gt; He began his new life standing up, surrounded by cold darkness and stale, dusty air.

&gt; Metal ground against metal; a lurching shudder shook the floor beneath him. He fell down at the sudden movement and shuffled backward on his hands and feet, drops of sweat beading on his forehead despite the cool air. His back struck a hard metal wall; he slid along it until he hit the corner of the room. Sinking to the floor, he pulled his legs up tight against his body, hoping his eyes would soon adjust to the darkness.

I get that it’s the style of writing, but why did writing/storytelling change to become so much more compact? Is it just minimalism?

And if it’s minimalism, does minimalist writing enhance the reading experience for stories?

I know that Readability Tests doesn’t mean much in terms of writing stories. However I did input the above short excerpts into analyze my writing.com and got these results:

Alice in Wonderland: Average 19.17 and Median 22.6

Emma: Average 16.12 and Median 16.47

The Hunger Games: Average 5.24 and Median 5.52

The Maze Runner: Average 8.02 and Median 8.37

To some extent, this tells us older books used more “fancy” language to tell their story. That’s pretty obvious, and I’m sure everyone knows that. But these excerpts I chose do not have any big words in it. Alice in Wonderland is even a kids book.

So according to Readability Tests— which once again, is more suited towards essays and the like— having longer sentences that are grammatically correct makes the writing more ‘advanced’ (and I’m using quotation marks here because I don’t agree with it and am just exploring all possibilities) and thus should be a better reading experience. 

But clearly, with the divergence from this style of writing, it is not. A more compact for of writing has taken over. Most books have three to four sentences in a single paragraph. They are quick to emphasize a point and move on. After all, periods are used to offset independent clauses from each other.

Is this minimalism? And if it is, is it better? I know when it comes to subjective questions like this, there is no definite answer. However, I am wondering if it is better in the sense that it says needs to be said without wasting words, while still delivering the full reading experience of immersing you into a scene?

I personally don’t actually read much books, so I can’t say I like one more than the other. But based on what I have read, I know for a fact that I’ve read and preferred modern stories to older works.

Or maybe I’ve overthinking all this. Could it just be a side effect of the evolution of our language and speech? That they wrote like how they spoke back then, and we write like how we speak now?

fmwcc5,snmattern,Major Reading Anxiety,"I’ve always been a vociferous reader and for most of my life, it’s been a go-to coping skill for me whenever I started to feel overwhelmed/stressed. Even when I had to read as part of my job or as required in grad school, I still made the time to read for fun. 

Of note, I also have an anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder (among other things), but I’ve been in weekly therapy for years and I take medications. 

Last January I started having difficulty choosing what book to read. Part of the problem was just having such a long TR list and choosing what to read was overwhelming. But then it progressed to me choosing a book, starting it, and then thinking I’ve somehow “made the wrong book choice” and then had to pick a different book. That cycle would just continue over and over and it’s been really rough since. I’ve been able to read, but not nearly as much as I would like to or that I used to. It makes me so sad and increases my anxiety. I’ve tried listening to books, which does help sometimes, but usually only with nonfiction. I’ve tried choosing more plot heavy and breezy novels, but that didn’t really change much. I try to take deep breaths and ground myself in the moment, but it doesn’t always work. I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she thinks it’s related to depression, though I don’t feel depressed. This is also the case with TV shows. 

Has anyone else experienced this for prolonged periods of times? Any advice?",22,1584863847,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmwcc5/major_reading_anxiety/,books,1

Just curious if I am the only one?

Other that as a continuation of The Three Musketeers it is good. There are a few issues regarding story where it drags in places, but I just started. My goal is to read every Three Musketeers story out there so yeah...I am just going to hope that there are others who can tell me to keep going, Twenty Years After to me is by far my favorite, but find one I need some time and maybe a bit of a discussion of story themes.

fmu5r5,prisonforkids,Prescient excerpt from ‘On Wings of Song’ by Thomas M. Disch (1978),"""March was a month of judgements. The annual disaster of winter seemed to have rent asunder all the rotted threads of the social fabric in a single weekend. Social organization collapsed beneath successive shocks of power failures, shortages, blizzards, floods, and ever more audacious acts of terrorism. Units of the National Guard sent out to arrest this avalanche defected en masse. Armies of crazed urban refugees spilled out of the ghettoes and swarmed over the fallow countryside, only to suffer the fate of Napoleon's troops in their retreat from Moscow. That was in Illinois, but every state had a tale of similar terribilità. After a while you stopped bothering to keep track, and after a while longer you couldn’t anyhow, since the media stopped reporting the latest disasters, on the hopeful theory that the avalanche might stop misbehaving if it weren't spoiled by so much attention. 

Meanwhile life went on pretty much as usual in New York, where disaster was a way of life.""",0,1584852153,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmu5r5/prescient_excerpt_from_on_wings_of_song_by_thomas/,books,1
fmu4zq,ankit_dey,Has anyone read 'The Soldier' by Roald Dahl?,"Among other writers, I find Roald Dahl to be an exceptionally good storyteller. Sure, I've loved his books including *Matilda*, *Danny, The Champion of the World* etc. but his short stories are outstanding; most evidently because of its 'twist-in-the-tale' nature, yes, but also because I feel, his stories delve deep into the minds of the people around whom the story is based on.

Last night, I finished a book and thought it would be a good time to catch up with some short stories, so without thinking twice I picked up Dahl and turned to a random page.

Came up *The Soldier*.

It doesn't reveal much (almost next to nothing, to be honest) but the name suggests that the protagonist of the story is a soldier. Sure it is, but the back drop isn't a war; it is a just a man (who was a soldier in the past) is returning home one night.

Throughout the story, his mannerisms, his actions, and his thoughts are...haywire, and I felt as if it is all a mesh. Could this be a depiction of PTSD? The horrors of the times of war coming back to him? He is what you can call an unreliable protagonist around whom the story progresses to be a terrifying tale of madness.

If you haven't read it, there are open internet sources available, I believe, where you can access it. I strongly suggest this short story.

fmr553,ThatOneNerdBoy,Book Review: The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka,"Recently I read ""The Metamorphosis"" by Franz Kafka. It was a great book, and here is my book review. Most of the summary is from the Internet. I've realized I can't write summaries to well. However, I did write two paragraphs in the end analyzing some themes in the novel.

  
Summary (mostly from the Internet):  
The Metamorphosis begins as Gregor Samsa, a traveling salesman, awakes to find himself transformed into a large insectoid. Among his first thoughts is the worry of missing the train and being late for work. He also laments the boredom of his job, to which he had resigned himself to pay off his parents' debts. Gregor’s family calls for him from outside the room. Gregor struggles to use his new body to move around. Later, and employee from Gregor’s job appears outside the locked door to Gregor's room, asking why Gregor has missed the early train. Gregor claims that he is slightly ill but will soon be on his way. Finally, Gregor manages to open his door. His appearance startles his coworker, and although Gregor tries to reason with him, claiming he will get dressed and be on his way to work, the clerk runs away from the house in fear. Gregor's father then appears and drives Gregor back into his room.  
In the ensuing days, Gregor's family members grow more accustomed to living with Gregor in this strange form, but only his sister Grete dares to enter Gregor’s room. When Gregor leaves his room weeks later, his mother becomes distraught, and her husband forces Gregor to his room under a violent hail of thrown apples. Gravely injured and largely unable to move, Gregor suffers a lonely convalescence that lasts for more than a month. In the interim Gregor's mother devotes herself to sewing while his sister takes a job as a salesgirl. Increasingly, Gregor is neglected by his family. They hire a charwoman to attend to the heavier work around the house, tasks that used to be performed by Gregor. Odds and ends are placed in his room for storage, primarily to make space for three male lodgers the Samsas have taken in to supplement their income. One evening as Grete plays the violin for these men, Gregor is attracted by the music and crawls unnoticed into the living room. Later, one of the boarders observes him. Citing the revolting condition of the household, the lodgers threaten to give notice and depart. Grete realizes that they must get rid of this giant bug, which she seems to no longer view as her brother.  
Grete tells her parents that they must get rid of Gregor or they will all be ruined. Her father agrees, wishing Gregor could understand them and would leave of his own accord. Gregor does understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom. There, determined to rid his family of his presence, Gregor dies.  
Upon discovering that Gregor is dead, the family feels a great sense of relief. The father kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady, who has disposed of Gregor’s body. The family takes a trolley ride out to the countryside, during which they consider their finances. Months of spare living as a result of Gregor’s condition have left them with substantial savings. They decide to move to a better apartment. Grete appears to have her strength and beauty back, which leads her parents to think about finding her a husband.  
Despite his complete physical transformation into an insect at the beginning of the story, Gregor changes very little as a character throughout The Metamorphosis. Most notably, both as a man and as an insect Gregor patiently accepts the hardships he faces without complaint. When his father’s business failed, he readily accepted his new role as the money-earner in the family without question, even though it meant taking a job he disliked as a traveling salesman. Similarly, when he first realizes he has transformed into an insect, he does not bemoan his condition, wonder about its cause, or attempt to rectify it in any way. On the contrary, he quickly accepts that he has become a bug and tries to go about his life as best he can in his new condition. The narration in the story mirrors Gregor’s calm forbearance by never questioning or explaining how or why this odd transformation occurred or remarking on its strangeness. Instead, the story, much like Gregor, moves on quickly from the metamorphosis itself and focuses on the consequences of Gregor’s change. For Gregor, that primarily means becoming accustomed to his new body.

Theme Analysis (mine):  
The book sheds light on the plight of invalids in society. This is depicted through the rejection of Gregor by the Samsa family after his transformation. Gregor is no longer able to work or function by himself. This leads to his family ostracizing him. Even his father ceases to show much affection for Gregor. Kafka attempts to draw parallels to people in the real world who have become sick or old. These invalids are often shunned by their families and left to die or suffer alone. Through this book, Kafka paints a deeply psychological portrait of the silent sufferers and invalids of today’s society.  
Kafka goes further to demonstrate the superficiality and greed present in contemporary society. For instance, Gregor’s first thoughts once he wakes up in his new body are about missing the train to work. Gregor puts himself through hardships in his life just to feed his family, who don’t think about his welfare. Gregor’s family only thinks about the money they will lose after his transformation. In the novel, Kafka reveals how people have become callous toward everything but wealth. He shows how people sell their souls to the bureaucracies that have invaded even our most intimate relationships. Kafka’s prevailing message to the people of the world is to put morality first.",2,1584839744,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmr553/book_review_the_metamorphosis_by_franz_kafka/,books,1

fmp1c9,Gossamer642,As a woman what is your view on this quote from George Orwell's 1984?,"&gt; ""Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro, corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living, or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to him that the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing then hardened, roughened up by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? The solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the fruit be held inferior to the flower?""

Is this kind of description or characterisation of a woman transitioning from youth to maturity endearing or chafing? Also I would be curious as to whether if you consider yourself before or after this stage and how that might affect your views on the quote.

I'm a fairly young man so I take it from a very different perspective of course and I thought it was kind of a nice tribute, despite some of the blunt description.",11,1584831956,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmp1c9/as_a_woman_what_is_your_view_on_this_quote_from/,books,1

To my surprise, that part never came up in the audiobook. 

Did the audiobook leave out that part? Do you remember reading anything about private armies? Pretty sure i'm mixing up some other podcast/book with American Kingpin.

fmmtat,koegelsbologna,I just finished book three of The Stormlight Archive...,"...and I love this series so far! This series was the first of Brandon Sanderson's work I've read.

My main reason for posting is to ask these questions:

What book set in The Stormlight Archive cosmere should I read next??

What did you think of The Stormlight Archive?

More about me/my thoughts...

I used to read all the time - mostly historical, biographical, and political non-fiction - but I dropped out the habit for years, excepting an annual re-read of the Harry Potter series (going on fourteen years!). I just couldn't get into a book enough to keep with it. I know depression played a huge role losing my reading hobby, but I also wondered if maybe I just wasn't enjoyed the non-fiction genre as much as a used to.

Then I started reading ASOIAF and was HOOKED. I realized that maybe fantasy was the genre for me, so when I finished ""A Dance with Dragons"", I started The Kingkiller Chronicle series by Patrick Rothfuss. My love of fantasy novels grew from there.

Regarding The Stormlight Archives...
My favorite things about this series:

- The perspective: third-person omniscient is my favorite narrative perspective for fantasy genres, especially when the perspective shifts between multiple characters.
- The world building: I really enjoyed how the universe unfolds as the story unfolds. I appreciated how consistent the universe is, too, and that events which occurred earlier in the story are subtly explained before they are explicitly explained.
- The characters: The majority of the characters are very complicated, which I find incredibly interesting as a reader. Most of the main actors are ever-changing shades of grey, but there are still a few main actors who are a little more straight-forward. Personally, I really appreciate that some characters are as they seem - it helps ground the narrative.

My not-favorite things about this series:

- The interludes: there are four parts in each of the (three) books, and between each part is an interlude focusing on an actor outside of the main plot. Sometimes these interludes are very short, and sometimes they're...well, not. From a storytelling perspective, I, for the most part, understand the purpose of these interludes, but they were the least enjoyable parts of the books for me by far.
- The pacing: parts of ""Oathbringer"" (book 3) really lagged for me. The action felt like it took place in fits and starts. While very important to character development and likely future events, the flashback chapters were an obstacle for me as a reader. There are other plot lines which lagged for me in ""Oathbringer"" - namely Shadesmar
- The anticipation: when I started the series, I didn't realize that only three books of ten are published. What have I gotten myself into?!",17,1584825435,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmmtat/i_just_finished_book_three_of_the_stormlight/,books,1

fmmmri,TRJF,"For the fifth time in my life, I broke down and ugly-cried while reading a book - and I noticed a theme...","*Spoiler tag out of an abundance of caution, because I'm talking about characters' deaths.*  
  
The first four times I've just started absolutely bawling while reading were:   
  
1. The end of *Flowers for Algernon,* when I was rather young,
2. The end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,* when Harry tells his son about the one of the bravest people he ever met,
3. The Alamo Gulch chapter of *The Subtle Knife*, and  
4. In *The Return of the King,* during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, when Éomer first called the Rohirrim to ride to victory, and then to death.  
  
So, today, I was reading *Ender's Shadow* by Orson Scott Card, having greatly enjoyed *Ender's Game* and *Speaker for the Dead.*  In the penultimate chapter (titled Ender's Game), I reached the part where ""Bean understood a third and most important reason for what was happening,"" which ultimately comes down to humans' desire to preserve each individual life but ultimate willingness to sacrifice those lives ""when,"" as Bean clinically conceptualizes it, ""the cause is sufficient.""  
  
I broke down and bawled at the end of that paragraph; I had to put the book down, and run out of the room, and blow my nose and wipe off my face.  And after I finished the book, I realized - except perhaps for the generally sad ending of one of the saddest books that I read when I was probably a little too young - **all the scenes in books that make me cry** are really about people sacrificing their lives, in the face of long odds, facing certain or near-certain death, to protect others.  In books and movies, I never cry when a favorite or important character dies - except when that character charges into that death headlong, knowing it's inevitable but facing it bravely.  That makes me fall to pieces.  
  
Without thinking too hard about what that means about me, I wanted to ask a twist on the old classic.  I know this sub constantly gets ""what books made you cry"" posts (and I enjoy reading the responses!); I want to ask: **have you noticed any pattern or theme in the types of books or scenes that make you cry?**",15,1584824931,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmmmri/for_the_fifth_time_in_my_life_i_broke_down_and/,books,1

fmkpay,solomonjsolomon,I Finished the Modern Library 100!!,"Well, I did it! I finally finished the [Modern Library's 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century](http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/)!

Almost three years ago I left teaching in a small rural town and was desperately burned out. When I took a survey of my life I realized that I hadn't read anything for pleasure during my time as a teacher and about two and a half years ago I settled on reading through this list. I figured it would be a way to focus my choice of reading, to read things that would be compelling and be culturally relevant, and just to make sure that I didn't let up.

I was exposed to a body of literature that I would never have investigated had I not started this journey, which has been incredible. I feel a lot less like a fake cultured snob and a lot more like a true cultured snob who will be able to look down my nose at people at fancy dinner parties, so that's cool.

My general thoughts:
* This is list surprisingly good about including writers of color (though it could be better), but there is a pretty egregious lack of female voices.
* Related: so much of a male perspective on sex, so little of a female perspective on sex. For the century of the sexual revolution this seems insane to me!
* I was also surprised about how old the list was, almost nothing written after 1970. I think reading some more recent classics &amp; more literature written by women will be my next mission.
* I love Faulkner, and I discovered that I love DH Lawrence as well. They paint such sensitive pictures of fragile, real characters living their lives! 
* Henry James and Edith Wharton don't do it for me. Why use many word when few word do trick?
* Isolating for the pandemic allowed me to power through the ends of Finnigans Wake (which took me about two years) and Ulysses. Maybe now is a good time for all of you out there to start on a new reading mission?",38,1584819140,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmkpay/i_finished_the_modern_library_100/,books,1
fmkg61,PunchieCWG,"I just finished Leo Tolstoy's *War And Peace*, holy cow that book is a lot.","I just wanted to share what I took away from the book and hoping to gain some more insights and comments from other people who have read this literary marathon.

I guess my main take aways are chiefly: 

Incredible surprise that so many of the characters are relatable and how many have qualities and traits that I recognise in myself and people from my own life.

How close to home it hits, when the characters, several times during their life decide: ""I now know what is right and good""

How pleasant it was to read about old friends meeting, getting all riled up in discussions and still being fast friends regardless of their difference of opinion on certain subjects.

I was stoked that Pierre found his confidence after being taken prisoner and super bummed about how his relationship with Natasha ends up being.

Prince Nicolai Bolkonsky's (Andrey's father) death struck me as so real and so sad and that is compounded by seeing it through the eyes of Maria.

Maria ended up with a man much like her father and not like him at all at the same time, which I found very interesting. I was cheering for her the whole book and she seems to have found happiness at the end.

What the what is up with that crazy long rant on scientific theory in the epilogues?

I hope some people on here will read this and add to my joy of completing this book. Which was a lot better than I'd expected.",10,1584818312,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmkg61/i_just_finished_leo_tolstoys_war_and_peace_holy/,books,1

fmfx9p,TMS2017,Short Book Review: The Decadent Society by Ross Douthat,"I’m posting a brief review of Ross Douthat’s new book, The Decadent Society, because I think it’s extremely interesting and important. Basically, the premise of Douthat’s book is that the modern Western world is trapped in “civilization languor,” and has been trapped there for a very long time – maybe since the Moon landing of 1969 – and more than ever, we cannot ignore evidence that we are victims of “economic stagnation, political stalemates, cultural exhaustion, and demographic decline.”

I absolutely agree with all this, and this is a subject that has been on my mind for a long time. I remember having a conversation with a co-worker in 2018, in which he was making the case that we are living in an era of profound change, and the world is much different than it was decades ago. “Not really,” I replied. “30 years ago, everyone was watching ‘Roseanne’ on TV. Now, we’re watching ‘Roseanne’ on TV…and Hulu” (this was during the brief ‘Roseanne’ reboot).

So I absolutely agree with Douthat’s premise, but what makes Douthat shine as a writer is that he does an impressive deep dive into all the arguments (for and against) why this might be happening and what it might take to get Western society out of its doldrums. I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I call it a true intellectual tour de force, and arguably the most important book I’ve read in at least a decade (maybe longer).  It deserves a large audience, and I want to do my part in spreading the word.

But I also want to spitball some of my own ideas why this might be happening and what it will take to get some real vitality back into our society (not just an endless rehash of Star Wars movies).

I have a lot of thoughts, but I’ll just share a couple. First, I think we ignore the fact that the overwhelming majority of Westerners – if they ever thought about it for more than two seconds – are generally satisfied with what Douthat calls “the decadent society.” I remember talking with a co-worker during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, and she said something to the effect of “I’m scared to death about the stock market…oh, and I can’t wait to buy the new i-phone!” Is it any wonder then that Democrats and Republicans came together for a $700 billion Wall Street bailout, to keep “the system” alive… at least until the next financial crisis? We live in a society where people are financially comfortable, for the most part. And they do not want to rock the boat; they are fine with stasis (or at least miniscule, predictable growth).

I also think religion plays a big part in this…For literally centuries, Christianity was a true missionary religion. It encouraged expansion, a sense of meaning, and a sense of purpose – at both the individual and societal level. This type of Christianity was basically extinguished in Europe during World War II. But it stayed strong in America through the 1960’s. But today, it’s a minority in America. And nothing has filled its place. Which is at least slightly odd because I do think there’s merit to the idea that we – as human beings – have something like a religious instinct; some hunger for divine connection and purpose. We’re just not really doing anything with it. Which I guess goes back to the issue I raised in the paragraph above, which is that we are very materially comfortable (with our i-phones and what not) and we don’t want to challenge ourselves to do anything original.

Last thought before I go: What are the prospects for true change, to break free from “the decadence?” Well, I like the quote from the economist Herbert Stein, “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.” So, indeed, one day “it will stop.” But will that be in our lifetime or a thousand years from now? I go back and forth, although I lean toward “later rather than sooner.” And I think that’s partly because the powerful have…well…a lot of power. And they have a lot of financial, political, and media resources to maintain that power (as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis and the 2010’s European debt crisis). In that sense, we might be living in a “new Middle Ages,” where not a lot happens culturally and politically speaking, because – like during the Middle Ages – there is a true elite that can stop change (either with “soft power” or “hard power”). The era from say, 1492 to 1969, saw power much more diffused than during the Middle Ages or today. Even if a critical mass of Westerners wanted to truly challenge that power (and that’s debatable), could they even succeed? I’m skeptical.  

And that gets me to one final, final thought (sorry): Why is it that people like Douthat, myself, and a small minority of others find this state of affairs to be depressing? Why aren’t we celebrating this “end of history?” I think it’s because – if you look at our society with a microscope – and I mean really, really look closely at it – it’s a society whose overarching purpose is consumption…material consumption…the more consumption, the better. And that is extremely alienating to those of us who do really believe that life is NOT about consumption; it has moral purpose (whether that’s Christian, Islamic, New Age, Objectivist, whatever). We yearn for something better – at least a little better – and the world of 2020 does not really have that. Will it have it in, say, 2030? Well, anything’s possible. Coronavirus, for example, might be extremely significant. But, as of now, we do not. And more people need to know about it, discuss it, and challenge it.  

I highly recommend Douthat’s book.

fmdyqq,gtoques,Getting Caught Up in Small Details while reading,"As a reader, I face a few challenges while reading long and/or dense books. A significant one is **getting caught up in small details.** I often get caught up trying to understand and think about every little thing mentioned by the author. If I am not able to 100% understand something the author mentions, even though I'm able to understand what the author is *generally* saying in that passage - and how it fits into the larger thing being talked about - I'm unable to move on to the next sentence/paragraph without reading and re-reading the same sentence again, before *fully* understanding what the sentence means on its own. Now, there are two things that might explain this:

i) **I'm not paying enough attention** to the book/my **reading comprehension skills are poor**, and so sentences that are supposed to be understood in a single reading take me several tries and careful thought to understand.

ii) **It is perfectly normal not to understand each and every sentence on a deep level** while reading a book - particularly if it is dense or on a complicated subject - and one should avoid getting stuck on individual sentences as long as one understands what the sentence is doing. Of course, this is not true if you're writing an analytical paper on the book, but here I'm talking about reading books for my own pleasure/understanding. In this case, **it is better to not slow oneself down (and possibly lose interest in the book) by fixating on individual details, but to maintain a flow in reading - even if it means that you're not understanding each and every sentence at a deep level.**

Do others here face the same problem while reading? If so, how did/do you address it? How did/do you approach the problem; do you see it being caused by i) or ii)?",9,1584792249,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmdyqq/getting_caught_up_in_small_details_while_reading/,books,1

I feel localized myths definitely have a foot up for me though I have no idea why. Relatability, I'd imagine.

1 - LANCE MEET KITTY

On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha, Lance Lear, poet, raconteur, Renaissance man, stood facing the setting sun, thumb in the air, as the 18 wheelers full of toilet paper rolled past, drivers wearing gas masks.

It had been two weeks since Mairka shut down. The CORONAVIRUS, COVID 19, BOOMER REMOVER, had turned the country, and half the world, upside down, and inside out. Welcome to the NEW NORMAL, motherfuckers; the Mad Max meets Monty Python Matrix, where there is no blue pill, not red, pill, just bad brown acid, plenty of it, and plenty more where it came from.

The virus was beating the shit out of the world. The  world was on its knees, and the virus was feeding it shots, like a slobbering, raving, drunken Roberto Duran sticking needles into a Sugar Ray Leonard voodoo doll.

Every time Uncle Sam thought the worst was over, the virus came back, and kicked him in the balls again.

Victims, cured once, relapsed again, and again. Few of them rolled over and let the reaper have them in their asses, but none of them ever fully recovered. The virus was toying with them, stealing their lives little by little, crippling them physically, destroying their will to fight on, no matter how many thoughts and prayers were issued for their salvation.

Everywhere around the world, the people begged for a cure, like a pack of bitches in heat, howling for a slick, stiff, pink dog dick under a full moon. Governments ordered any and every facility with the technology to help the losing cause to convert, and do so. All but one, that is.

The arms industry was exempted from the conscription, first in Mairka, then around the globe. If the world survived, no matter how many humans lived, no matter how beleaguered they were, they would have to be ready to fight wars to preserve all they had left. ‘twas ever thus. So long as the blood of the bankers did not run in the streets, the fuckers would continue to pull the strings of puppet governments, and do everything in their power to make sure it would always be.

Lance Lear had watched it all going to Hell in a shopping cart full of hand sanitizer for exactly thirteen days, before saying, “Fuck it,” and hitting the road. He’d been exposed to the virus hundreds of time. The virus never laid a glove on him. He was immune. He knew not how, or why, and he didn’t give a fuck. He had a book to sell, and like every wordsmith, he had fuck all better to do. If it was to be the end of the world, Lance Lear wanted to go number one, with a bullet, on every best sellers list, before the Reaper ass raped him into submission, choking him out as he did so. If that meant selling them one download at a time, well, he had fuck all better to do.

Lance pulled out a smoke, lit it, and stared down the road bemusedly. It couldn’t be real. Could it? It was. Lance laughed, “It’s a girl, my lord, in a flatbed Ford, slowing down to take a look at me.”

Kitty twitched when she saw Lance on the side of the road. A bolt of sexual adrenaline ran through her nubile, 105 pound body, from her pretty little head, all the way down to her pretty little toes, five feet and two inches below.

She stopped, rolled the passenger side window  down halfway, and said, “What's your name? Where you going?”

“Name's Lance. But never mind where I'm going. The question is,  where the fuck am I? This ain’t Arizona. Ain’t no fucking corn fields  in Arizona. So, you shouldn’t be here. I’m waiting for the Metallica tour bus. Or Bob Segar. Whatever it says in Revelations. This timeline just went into Dali time. It’s all fucked up. Who the fuck are you? Where the fuck did you come from?”

Kitty burst into laughter. “Good answer! That’s why I bought the truck, when the shit started hitting the fan. I guess you’re the one. Get in. Unless you’re really gonna wait for Lars, or Kirk to come along and suck your dick. If that is the case, you most definitely ain’t the one, and this plotline is way too fucked up for me.”",1,1584779697,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmby26/live_lit_experiment_die_laughing/,books,1

Some series' that I loved: 

Wheel of Time (was a bit slow, but I made it through in the end)

Kingkiller Chronicles (come on book 3!!!!!!)

3) What discussions does the book promote about the impacts of slavery?

fmac75,Bald-Librarian,I don't understand why people like Atlas Shrugged.,"I do not understand why anybody likes this dreary grey pill of a book. 

I'm not going to get into Ayn Rand's Politics too deeply. They are, frankly, irrelevant. However, I will say this - It's deeply ironic that a woman so obsessed with excellence, achievement and the triumph of the human spirit , often expressed through art, was such a piss-poor writer.

Because that's what it comes down to. Ayn Rand isn't a very good author of fiction. 

It's about her monotonous, droning, entirely unromantic prose. I don't feel invested in the world, the characters, the story. The dry, dull writing style makes it hard to get into the philosophy, too. I mean, a philosophy can carry a book, but my Lord is Atlas Shrugged just fucking boring.

 It's about her 60 pages dedicated to a single speech.  It's about her one dimensional, cartoonishly evil antagonists born out of turn of the century cartoons. Honestly, I'm amazed Dagny is never tied to railroad tracks, the whole thing is so hamfisted and tacky. 

And that's what it comes down to. The whole book feels like Rand setting up a wicker man of ""People I don't like"" to be set on fire and sacrificed by ""Men I'd like to have sex with."" Great victories she wins against her philosophical enemies in her imaginary battles.

If you think highly of Rand's philosophy, that's your business. She's still a shitty author of fiction and Atlas Shrugged feels like philisophical Fan-Fiction full of Self-Insert Sues, Perfect Boyfriends, and comedic antagonists who collapse the second Sexy Hero Boyfriend pushes them, before sweeping Self-Insert off her feet and you know what else? They totally make out, you guys and it's so hot and steamy.

I'd say it's like if Holden Caulfield wrote a book, complete with a 60 page tirade against Phonies. It's not a beautiful book about an insufferable character. It's just an insufferable fucking book.",16,1584770028,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fmac75/i_dont_understand_why_people_like_atlas_shrugged/,books,1

Before this I knew nothing of Percy Fawcett and his expeditions. The book opens telling you that he goes on his final expedition never to be seen or heard of ever again but throughout my entire read I kept expecting that it was going to take a turn and have him show up and explain what had happened which mirrored the thoughts of Fawcett's family and fellow explorers. Finishing this makes me want to go back and re-vist ""The River of Doubt"".

I just finished the book on Audible. My friend sent it to me and I was hesitant at first. I gave it a go anyway. It was suprisingly good. I'm not a huge sci-fi/fantasy guy (which is suprisingly because my favorite books are Words of Radiance and The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson followed closely by LotR) but I enjoyed the unique plot of the book.

What I liked: The unique plot set up. Most of the book treats what will become the climax without much focus. The focus is on the main character adapting and overcoming obstacles and applying science to a primitive culture.

What I didn't like: The prose was sometimes heavy-handed. I found myself thinking a better writer could have put more finesse into what are rather dull moments in the book. Also, the narrator is just a bit stiff. But I'm used to Scott Brick, Kate Reading, and Michael Kramer.

I will definitely be reading book two, after I read Sherlock Holmes narrated by Stephen Fry.",2,1584762325,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fm8t4x/cast_under_an_alien_sun_by_plan_thorensen/,books,1

fm7i8y,denymore92,I love Animal Farm by George Orwell,"After reading this book, two things appeared in my mind:

1. This book is inspiring and compelling.
2. George Orwell is really a genius.

I watched the movie version of the story with my mun when I was still a kid. At that time, The only thought I had was: ""Napoleon is a bad pig."" ( It's still true though) I didn't know that this story is about history and politics.

To be honest, I don't like history much and I don't know anything about politics either. But after reading this book, I couldn't help but search on the net and wanted to find out more about who or what the characters represent in Animal Farm. This is now fascinating this book is. I think I'm more interested in history because of it and I understand deeply that the saying ""history repeats itself"" is so true. Here are what I like about this book:

1. The message in this book is so clear and easy to understand, yet it's important. We shouldn't blindly follow others. We should have our own judgments and thoughts or we will end up being taken advantages of.
2. The descriptions of different types of animals' personality and behaviours are really vivid and interesting. No wonder why even children like this story too.
3. The things that happen in the book are still happening nowadays in 2020. This book was written so long ago and the ideas are still so valid even after so many decades. That's make this book so amazing.
4. One special thing is, the ending of this book is very disturbing but I really kind of like it since it is so real. That's the reality. There isn't always a happy ending in real world.

The character I hate most is Squealer. He is such an evil pig. I hate him most when he cried crocodile tears when Boxer was declared dead. Squealer is a nasty liar. I wish he became bacon.

One was the amazing Landmark edition, translated by Crawley, with maps almost on every page, not to mention informative appendixes and helpful summaries and footnotes on each page.

# [Strange Days](https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2020/03/17/strange-days/) 

March 17, 2020

📷 

Strange days are upon us.   As ancient as I am, I cannot recall ever having lived through anything like the past few weeks.

We’re taking steps here in New Mexico, like everywhere else.

Meow Wolf is closed.  A wise precaution, given the huge size of the  crowds that customarily gather daily to see the House of Eternal  Return.   MW draws people from all over the country, indeed all over the  world, and it is very much a hands-on exhibit where visitors are  encouraged to touch everything and go everywhere.   Shutting it down  promptly was a good move.

As of today, I am also closing the Jean Cocteau Cinema.  The JCC only  has a seating capacity of 130, and we achieve that no more than three  or four times a year; attendance at the theatre and the bar is usually  well below the state-mandated cap of 50.  Even so, why take chances?  I  prefer to err on the side of caution, so we’re shutting down the theatre  until April 15, at which time we will take stock and re-evaluate.    Honestly, I have no idea where things will stand in Santa Fe, New  Mexico, the US, or the world in a month’s time.   Things have been  changing so fast.   But our intent is to keep the theatre closed until  the relevant authorities tell us that it is safe to reopen.

I am also shutting down my non-profit, the Stagecoach Foundation, for  the duration.  Stagecoach customarily holds classes and workshops in  various aspects of film and television production, for kids aspiring to  have careers in the entertainment industry, but we won’t be having any  while the coronavirus is still raging.

Despite the shutdowns, we will continue to pay our employees at Stagecoach and the Jean Cocteau, for the foreseeable future.

We are keeping our bookstore, Beastly Books, open for the time  being.   The bookstore never has more than a handful of customers at any  one time, except for author events — and we’re cancelling or postponing  all of the signings and readings we had scheduled.   We have stocked  the store with disinfectants and sanitizers, and we will be carefully  monitoring the situation going forward.   If it seems best to shut the  bookstore too, we will do that.

Meanwhile, however, our mail order service will also remain open.   With quarantines, lockdowns, and social isolation on the menu  everywhere, and all the usual entertainment venues closing their doors, ***reading***  is the best way to pass the empty hours.  If you need a few books to  get you through the next month or so and distract you from all that is  going on in the world, we have some great reads on offer, and ALL our  books are autographed.  Have a browse at [https://jeancocteaucinema.com/product-category/signed-books/](https://jeancocteaucinema.com/product-category/signed-books/)

For those of you who may be concerned for me personally… yes, I am  aware that I am very much in the most vulnerable population, given my  age and physical condition.   But I feel fine at the moment, and we are  taking all sensible precautions.  I am off by myself in a remote  isolated location, attended by one of my staff, and I’m not going in to  town or seeing anyone.   Truth be told, I am spending more time in  Westeros than in the real world, writing every day.   Things are pretty  grim in the Seven Kingdoms… but maybe not as grim as they may become  here.

Some days, watching the news, I cannot help feeling as if we are all  now living in a science fiction novel.   But not, alas, the sort of  science fiction novel that I dreamed of living in when I was a kid, the  one with the cities on the Moon, colonies on Mars, household robots  programmed with the Three Laws, and flying cars.   I never liked the  pandemic stories half so well…

Let us hope we all come through this safe and sound.   Stay well, my friends.   Better to be safe than sorry.

fm3bhc,coverthespread75,Theory and Discussion of The Road by Cormac McCathy,"Just finished **The Road** last night, read it in one sitting. 

There’s been a lot of discussion of this book in this sub but I haven’t seen anyone have a similar takeaway or theory that I have. Curious to hear what you think. Also, I'm not the most sophisticated reader, so if I am misusing a term or I clearly misunderstand something please correct me. 

I think The Man and The Boy are dead, and they are stuck in a quasi-Purgatory, attempting to find salvation. 

Oxford Dictionary: Purgatory - (in Roman Catholic doctrine) a place or state of suffering inhabited by the souls of sinners who are expiating their sins before going to heaven. 

McCarthy does a wonderful job of making us understand just how miserable the world is, how bleak and desolate, and how horrifyingly dangerous fellow man has become. He makes it clear that whatever ended the world, will ensure it stays ended. 

It is also clear that crops do not grow and animals no longer exist. Everyone must live on what was canned prior to the destruction and on what they kill (they do find some apples and mushrooms each one time, but I get the impression that was a very rare find). This means that there is a practical limit to how long the world can last. That once all canned goods and human flesh is gone, so is the world as it relates to man. 

With a limit of sustenance and the game of survival being played at the highest level, the conduct by which one plays the game is how one is judged. The Boy is constantly and consistently the beacon of kindness and hope (though he himself often lacks it). His innocence and willingness to help and his refusal to cause harm, indiscriminate of how the other is first encountered, is in this argument's vision following the road to salvation. I think it is not coincidence that The Boy is always asking to hold The Man's hand, for he is the one leading the man away from damnation. 

The Man on the other hand is at times straddling the two, which is what makes this story so gripping. To kill and plunder with impunity would be the easiest way to survive, which is what they are constantly evading. In the first part of the story when The Man kills the guy who had a knife to The Boy's throat, that is the cost of protection one's own, and destroying the evil one encounters, for The Man knew the men in the truck would kill and eat and worse them both. However, he follows the road to damnation when he kills the thief who stole their cart and belongings in the end of the story. This is one of the most morally difficult parts of the story I had trouble with. 

I feel like we can all understand The Man's anger and fear when they caught up to the thief. The thief left them for dead by taking everything they had, of course you kill someone like that in the context of this story, because to let him go would allow yourself to be vulnerable to his actions again. Sort of like the Scorpion and Frog fable. But all The Boy saw was a man who was scared and hungry, and he begged his father not to kill him. This could be interpreted as naivete on The Boy's part, or true compassion for fellow man. After all they had seen and been through, The Boy's compassion is something to marvel at. 

Because The Man killed the thief, against the protest and pleading of The Boy, and in such a cruel fashion -I think this is the crucial part-, that was his final act of commitment to damnation. The Man, for all his kindness and love of The Boy, and his desperate attempt to never let The Boy give up, had given up, or had a lapse, in conducting himself like The Good Guys. Following that commission, his fate had been sealed and that is the reason his health deteriorated so quickly afterwards.

With The Man now dead, The Boy had fulfilled his duty in purgatory, what sins led him there, I have no idea; being born in purgatory? If The Man's duty was to protect The Boy and teach him right from wrong, The Boy's duty was to ensure The Man acted accordingly, and to remind The Man of the need for compassion and love in the world. A failure on The Man's part to be good does not constitute a failure on The Boy's. 

-----
    Aside: Why would The Man allow himself to kill the thief so cruelly in front of The Boy? It undermines the belief he had instilled in The Boy that they they were the ones who carry the fire, they are the good guys. Forcing a man to freeze to death is not what good guys do. In the context of this world, if it were to be so that the thief must die, there are kinder ways to do it. I also thought The Man committed a great sin of omission in the very beginning when he didn't kill the man who had been struck by lightning. To expedite an inevitability would have been a kindness. Perhaps not? 

 Also along the way The Man had made mistakes, lapses in judgement by being lazy, or just flat broken. Not watching and waiting to ensure the coast is clear, like when they found the people in the cellar and barely escaped the cannibals. Or not adequately checking the canned food from the ship, getting The Boy sick. Or perhaps after years of toil, he had finally been beat down enough to be just like the people they had spent the entire time evading. 
------

After grieving for three days, The Boy steps out onto the road and meets a hardened man who appears to be the first Good Guy they've met, like, ever. He seems kind, he is willing to take on The Boy, the group has a little boy and a little girl so The Boy can have friends. There is a woman who wraps him in her arms, giving The Boy a mother's love for the first time in his life. 

The book ends with a beautiful paragraph that starts ""Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains..."". I don't know how to properly articulate this thought, but I think somehow the mention of ""Once"", and the act of them walking on the road, means that out of purgatory they left and to heaven they entered in the form of the world before. That the salvation and paradise they fought so hard to find is a world of brook trout in the stream and a world that is older than man (reference to the last sentence in the book). On page 219, The Man is thinking back to a time with his wife before the destruction, they are camped out on the beach and after smoothing her hair he says ""if he were God he would have made the world just so and no different."".

There are two things that have forced me to this view, the fist being the benevolent group finding The Boy. Every person they had met on the road was either no help to them, or a mortal threat. Every person along the way would have made surviving any longer impossible. The old man with the cane in the beginning would have been a parasite had they taken him on, the roving bands of thugs catching slaves and eating them, the thief at the end leaving them for dead. No one in this story was any help until The Man died. 

The timing of the benevolent group is too convenient, or appropriate. I don't know about any of you guys, but I have no idea how old this kid is. I have him pegged somewhere between 5 and 8. If that is the case, without the help of The Group no 5 year old could survive that world. The benevolent group finding The Boy when they did and taking him in is the divine intervention needed for The Boy to live, but I also believe they are the last few people on ""earth"" who deserve to leave it and make it to Heaven. It is his joining the group at the bearded guy's insistence that The Boy's willingness to trust and see good in the world was validated and that that initiated his entrance to heaven. 

The second thing that forced me to this view is that without their ascension to Heaven, there is no fucking hope in this book. Full Stop. With finite resources that will inevitably run out, and the never ending fight to not be killed by others, every last soul will perish. The boy having playmates and a mother's caress during their collective starving to death doesn't leave much hope in my heart for The Boy; for without the prospect of Heaven, to continue on in that world would without question be an exercise in futility. 
 

That's my case, apologies for how long it is but I did my best to make it as pithy as possible, and by making it pithy I left out more supporting arguments, so if it sounds a bit choppy and rushed, that's why. Very curious to hear what you guys think. Have a safe weekend wash your hands you filthy animals. 

TL;DR: The Man and The Boy are dead, they roam Purgatory seeking Salvation. Only The Boy gets it.",14,1584740371,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fm3bhc/theory_and_discussion_of_the_road_by_cormac/,books,1

As readers do we tend to be too subjective when reading a book or explaining why we dont like the books? I.e. if i read a book then I don't like the subject matter for example then i deem the book to be terrible.

Surely when we say we don't like a book we should break it down more, for example i DNF atBlood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy just passed 100 pages. I found the book to be very heavy on the descriptions which I find boring (subjective) however looking at the book objectively it is one of the best written books I've come across language wise.

fm2h4v,MrVanDude,How has The Lord of the Rings impacted you?,"I just finished The Return of the King on Tuesday and feel like I have gained a new friend. In these uncertain times, it's nice to have something so consistent and heartwarming. The depth of the books astounds me. The book not only serves as an extraordinary elevation of tales like Beowulf and Le Morte d'Arthur, but also drives home important moral and ethical lessons. The strength of friendship, the power of kindness, and the value of perseverance are all so central to the narrative. 

This book can be read and interpreted in so many ways; it can be approached politically, religiously, linguistically, geographically, allegorically and so on and so forth. It amazes me that one man had such a strong vision, and that his vision has therefore informed most if not all fantasy that has followed. It's rather cliche to throw around ""masterpiece"" and ""genius"" but I'm not quite sure how else to quantify his work; the number of people who have derived joy from this book, and the number of people who hold his work in absolute reverence should be enough to reaffirm his status as one of the most important literary (and cultural) figures not only in modern history but history in its entirety.

Anyway, thank you for reading. I just had some thoughts about these books and wanted to share and hear what the people think.

fm20ir,ShinmaOC,"Earth by David Brin, a 1990 predictive future scifi novel that seems to be growing more accurate as more people demand their governments and wealthy stop hiding info and resources from them in the face of a crisis.","I discovered this gem in my freshman year, and it earned an instant spot on my annual reread list. 

Set in 2038, it painted a robust picture of a world which we are steadily approaching. *Earth* foretold of the rise and dominance of the Internet and social media in the form of the WorldNet, the primary source for information and entertainment, which can also generate an income based on the popularity of your content. It foretold of the growing elderly population and its subsequent political influence, and a generation of disenfranchised young adults. It foretold of cascading environmental crises, the increased melting of polar ice, and lab-developed crops/farming methods to deal with the changing climate and rising population. There was even a 'Trillion Trees' global reforestation campaign. But with 18 years to go, I can't escape the feeling that we're headed towards the nastier parts of Brin's predictions. 

One of the main events in the history of the story is the Geneva War (NATO vs Switzerland, which I'll get to in a bit) in which nuclear weapons were used. Global tensions were at an extreme high this January, the Doomsday Clock was moved forward, and many young people worried about a draft.

Poaching became an international crime, policed by NATO. While I don't think we'll go that far, the rampant depopulation of wildlife in recent decades has put some harsh laws in place, and public sentiment towards poachers/sport hunters is definitely against them.

As for the Geneva War, it's not the war itself that concerns me, rather the cause of it. The world of 20 years from now has been wracked by man-made disasters and environmental collapse. The story carries optimism in that we had thus far managed to get through every disaster thrown at us, if just barely. But the people that were the most unscathed every time were the wealthy and their pocket politicians. Nations were going bankrupt, diseases were rampant (nearly everyone gets skin cancer), but the 1% kept on 1%-ing. Eventually, the rest of the world said, ""No more secrets. Why are you letting so many die that don't have to, and where @#$! is all our money?!?"" The 1% replied, ""How about you go @#$! yourselves,"" and a war was had. Will we get to that point? I highly doubt it, but I don't give anything a 0% chance, and the road we're on looks the same from here.

I had the pleasure of meeting David Brin several years ago, and he was thrilled that I loved the book. He told me that he considers *Earth* to be a litmus test, that the people who were moved by his work were the people that hold the hope for our future.  ""Protect Her,"" he wrote to me with his signature. I'll never forget that moment.",7,1584735740,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fm20ir/earth_by_david_brin_a_1990_predictive_future/,books,1

I came across a great website today for buying books [https://www.bookdepository.com](https://www.bookdepository.com). It has a great selection of works at very reasonable prices and free delivery (!!!). However, I've always been more inclined towards buying used books, as generally cheaper and a bit more environmentally friendly – for how ecological the paper book market may be. Therefore I ask you, do you know any website that offers the same service of BookDepository, but selling used books?

Thanks for your answers, and a have a great weekend everyone 😊",27,1584734565,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fm1o7a/website_where_to_buy_used_books/,books,1

An example of this I just came across is in The Shining, where a character notices inanimate objects changing positions when he’s not looking. Eventually they return to normal and the character blames it on his imagination. Does this bother anyone else a little?

flyyrs,wutangjesus,Non-Fiction: Where is the Love?,"Don’t get me wrong, there is a reason Fiction is as popular as it is: it’s an escape. It takes you to worlds that simply aren’t possible in this one. 

But sometimes this world is worth remembering! History takes you back to a time and world that can be just as foreign as Westeros or Hogwarts. Biographies can take you through all the ups and downs, character development, and heartbreak of one of your favorite fictional protagonist. But the kicker is that it’s all real! 

Sometimes I find myself reading a non-fiction book as if it’s fiction, and when reality sets in that this was a real situation with real people, the emotions can be overwhelming. 

It also feels good to feel enlightened. When I finish a work of non-fiction, I’ve collectively learned everything that took someone years of research and discovery to put together. Lucky me! All the wisdom with a fraction of the work.

flxhfm,crowkk,Is HP Lovecraft worth reading?,"I'm currently reading Dracula and I'm loving it. It's a good terror ambiance without blood-splattering all over the place. The book goes well and progresses at a very good pace. Since I really got into this genre I considered reading Lovecraft as well since he, too, goes for mysticism, dark fantasy, but I'm unsure I'll like.   


The reasoning behind this uncertainty is that I'm still to get through Lord of the Rings. I respect Tolkien and all his creations and eventually I'll read the trilogy but jesus christ he drags everything with overdetaling and talking about stuff I, for one, couldn't care less.  


And hence my question: Is Lovercraft a decent-paced writer that tells what we want and lead us smoothly through the book or does he drag us through thick and unnecessary detailing?  


P.S.: This post feels like against R3 but since I'm proposing a discussion of whether or not Lovercraft is worth reading and why it is rather than just ""Yes read it"" or ""No dont read it"" I believe it's not against it.",19,1584720240,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flxhfm/is_hp_lovecraft_worth_reading/,books,1

flvftd,Eyadnlulu,7 ways to helped me to being successful working from Home.,"
In addition to the transformation journey industry is going through, and in light of the current environment related to the Coronavirus, where change is not a choice and thrusted upon us to go and work from home, it is a perfect time to show up as autonomous self-directed leaders. Being present, productive, responsive and make decisions to drive the business forward. I take this as a challenge and trial period to dig deep, show up as a leader, help others and make a difference in the way I work.

I have worked from home many times before, working in India I was able to work from home for a couple of years, while in USA and homebound for 2 months due to illness, in both incidences I was able to continue working and exceeding expectations in delivery every time.  Now in this epidemic working from the confines of my home in Southern California I make sure that I continue to show up and be present despite the negative news surrounding us, with a main focus in mind to help those who need me the most, the Patients, my family and those in my community.

I have developed 7 steps for how I work and operate from home to ensure effectiveness and success, I wanted to share those with you:

1)	Establish a home office space
     a.	I made an area in the house away as far as possible from TVs and the 
area where my kids play. This allows me to have quite time to work when needed. I even put a sign on the door indicating I am in a meeting so family understand.
      b.	I picked a spot and made it look like my office space at work with the necessary technology to keep my optimized while doing my work. 
     c.	I have space that is ergonomically right for me to work. I spend many hours in meetings, ergo is critical to my success. 
     d.	This also helps me develop a routine, as long as the office space is far away from where my life is it does not feel like an interruption to my home life. 
     e.	I tell family about it and about norms for working from home and distractions, I keep them informed and engaged.
      f.	I am never afraid of distractions; your coworkers understand that you are working from home and there might be an occasional kid screaming or a dog barking. People are more understanding and sometimes welcome the distraction to lighten up the mood in a meeting!


2)	Have a day plan, be agile in planning and flexible and adaptable to change. 
     a.	I Plan out what I will be working on ahead of time. This helps you stay focused, 
     b.	I even plan out around kids’ appointments, family critical activities as long as I make sure the business needs are met, I schedule family activities around my work needs where I need to deliver and be present. 
     c.	Sometimes that is difficult, but be agile, flexible and adaptable to change and find ways to work around it.

3)	Be present, honest and respectful of others time and working hours. You must be available when needed. It is important to me to respect this opportunity to work from home, doing so means
     a.	I am always present when needed. Although not always available, responding quickly by saying you are in a meeting, or give me a min, or I am taking mom to the hospital, or my child is requiring my attention, can I call you in 10 min. Being honest goes a long way, it shows you are present and could be reached easily.  
     b.	Always try to get to meetings on time or even earlier to show engagement. 
     c.	My biggest advice as much as you can turn on your camera! I try my best to be available on Camera, be present and show engagement on a personal level. Turning on the camera will keep you engaged and away from multi-tasking when your focus is required. I find this behavior will encourage others to do so and makes for a much more productive meeting. There are exceptions for those 4 am meetings where I just woke up 10 min ago, people do understand it is early and respect the fact that I show up to meetings at those hours when I can and understand I cant turn on the camera.  

4)	Self-Lead, be empowered, be flexible and agile in the way you work, now with transformation, you are a leader and now you have a chance to act like an autonomous leader! 
     a.	I use this time to show up as a leader, responsible and accountable for my own tasks.  
     b.	I set hours that work to meet business demands and balance that with time at home to enjoy a social life and engage with family. 
     c.	I developed a routine to get up, have a coffee, read news…etc. Act as if you are in the office if that helps you. 
     d.	I go out for a walk, exercise, don’t set at the desk all day.
     e.	I enjoy my independence as a leader. 

5)	Use digital technology to help you. Use technology to stay connected. Be creative, innovate new ways to get it done to make support your new way of working, For example, 
     a.	I removed all social media not to be distracted, remove it from computer, I also turn off notification except for email and Calendars, this would help reduce 
     b.	I use the instant messaging feature when I have questions, want to connect with others, or sometimes ask others could we do a hangout on the spot.
     c.	I experienced having to do Virtual Coffee chats, Virtual Sprints, Huddles, lunch and learn and now will be experiencing Virtual Happy hour with my colleagues…etc. This is tremendous in keeping connecting with colleagues. 
     d.	It gets lonely as I like people interaction and influencing and inspiring others, I connect with people and do networking sessions or just to say hello 
     e.	Stay engaged on google plus, offer support and help others connect with you. 
      f.	I use Calendar to Let everyone know I am working from home.

6)	Commit to doing more.
Knowing that I have this flexibility to work from home, I am no longer distracted by surroundings, I set my schedule and hours to meet the business, but also, I have a responsibility to ensure I do as much from home as I do at work and even more. Now I have time to think more, time to do more, time to focus more without outside forces. Prioritization is crucial and focus on the activities that matter is critical now to ensure that we deliver to the mission at hand in serving the patients. 
7)	Pick a definitive finishing time each day. Have a schedule and stick to it. Get in routine
Just because you work from home, does not mean you will have more work life balance, be careful with such assumptions, it can feel like being in a casino, you can get much done but you also can lose track of time while doing it. Just because I work from home does not mean I have to work all day, I always make sure that:
     a.	I establish those boundaries early on with better planning. 
     b.	I know when to stop and take time to refresh and not respond to emails. 
     c.	I Make sure those boundaries are respected and take the time to disconnect after a certain hour or throughout the day.
     d.	Establish a routine of how you want to work and stick to it. This is a chance to take charge, establishing a routine help people to stick to it.

flv9dh,Keaton126,My Thoughts on The Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis,"\- First off, I came at this book as a Believer already, though admittedly I have not been practicing nearly as strongly as I once did. Personal opinions of mine have changed. Personal interests of mine have changed. My career field, my relationships, a bit of laziness, moving, life events.... all of that have sort of caused me to become much less pious, as I am sure it has for millions of people. This book was a total punch in the mouth for me. It makes no excuses for folks like us, and in the great race of humanity through time and space towards our final destination, it accused me that I was falling short. I am still pondering how I should interpret this. And, for this invasion on my life choices alone, I think the book accomplished its goal.

\-The book is well written, steeped in  Christian philosophy, and adds the historical flavor of being authored in the midst of World War II by the famous English writer/philosopher/evangelist C.S. Lewis. It covers a series of letters between a demon (Screwtape), his pupil of a demonic tempter (Wormwood), and the ""patient"" Wormwood is attempting to seduce away from holiness and righteousness. In instructing the tempter in the ways and the aims of their ""Father"", the Devil, much is revealed about how temptation is performed, how our weaknesses are preyed upon, how our attitudes and personalities are used against us, and how our environment can also distract us from The Way and Truth. It's eye-opening, guilt inducing, and portrays a lifelong battle to stay out of the grasps of evil. 

\- I think the fact that I hate the way this book makes me feel is a good thing. Certainly, no one is perfect, and even more so certainly no one desires to be knowingly living wrong. I think my main gripe with Christianity, and religion in general, is that with all the freedoms we live under, especially here in America, religion tells us we can be living for evil even when we are not lawbreakers of our countries of origin, nor breakers of the ten commandments and other spiritual laws. It makes it seem as though living righteously on a daily basis  is rigorous and difficult ON TOP of a life of difficulty and hardship for the majority of the world. Again, maybe my feelings here are just me excuse-making, but often it seems as though the ""proper"" Christian lifestyle is pretty hard, rather than the freedom and peace it is said to offer. I know Wormwood would likely have a rather easy time handling me.

\- Anyway, stay safe and quarantine wisely. In all times, but in these times most of all, our spiritual lives should be of concern to us no matter our religions, doctrines or creeds. I am here if any of you quarantined out there want to discuss any of that which I have written or read. Be well always.

flry8d,AutoModerator,"Weekly Recommendation Thread: March 20, 2020","Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 ____

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

flrm8o,MacchaExplosion,How do you read?,"This isn't a post about literacy. I'm able to decode lines of symbols into the meaningful representations the author intended.

This is about how so many people that love books can speed through entire library wings faster than I can make it through a single chapter. This is simply a skill that I do not have and I'd like to hear especially from similar people who overcame these issues to become better readers.

Specifically, my issues are **speed** and **focus**. While I consider myself to be an intelligent person, I completely lack one of the skills that I often associate with intelligence. That is the ability to read and comprehend quickly. I get lost in large blocks of text and when I try to increase my speed, I end up skipping over things and getting lost.

Perhaps my largest issue, though, is focus. I can read a sentence or two before my mind starts spinning off in a separate direction. Often times, I won't even have noticed that I'm lost thinking about something else until a few pages later. Then I'll have to admit to myself that I have absolutely no idea what those last couple of pages consisted of. 

In short, I just feel like I should be a much better reader than I am. Being able to read with greater speed and focus would help me enjoy books more and would help me with my job which involves a lot of research.

Any tips to help a poor reader would be much appreciated!",16,1584693442,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flrm8o/how_do_you_read/,books,1

flr0tz,fireanddream,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of Flowers for Algernon and loathed the second half, why?","Right after Charlie returned from the science convention I lost all connection with him. 

The first half of the book is brilliant. The world unfolding in front of Charlie's eyes, the receding of his mental filter of his own memories, his humanity struggling to catch up with his IQ, and most stunningly the childhood abuse he suffers, all strongly resonate with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second half, however, just flat out doesn't make sense to me. 

I applauded at Charlie's new found maturity when he leaves Alice when he could dissect the his feeling for her. In the second half, what the hell? Never mind attempting to have sex with someone while pretending that's another person, and ""just another argument for polygamy"". 

Right before the convention, we sees that the genius finally begins to have a gasp for tolerance. Right after, he starts to treat people around him like shit. 

The first half, he gradually begins to understand his old self. The second half, he fights against it. 

&amp;#x200B;

The whole book, as Charlie says, is him going up the elevator and coming down. But having things basically return to zero sabotages the book in a way that astonishes me.

flqeiu,DonSol0,Which books are best read? Which are good as audiobooks?,"I really enjoy reading books. There’s something about the internal interpretation that makes the experience so much more personal. I also really enjoy listening to audiobooks. The experience, while a bit less personal, is so convenient that it can be done in almost any environment. It seems like anytime the topic is drawn, two camps pitch tents and start debating about which is better (I still don’t know if we’re saying “I read [book_0]” when we listened to the audiobook”). I’ve settled on the fact that I enjoy both books and audiobooks and am drawn to them for different reasons; these being mainly personalization and convenience respectively.

I’ve found that the type of book seems to plays a part in whether I’ll read or audiobook. Self improvement (I don’t do many but did “How to Win Friends and Influence People” recently), non-fiction, and academic can generally be done losslessly in audiobook form. I can’t imagine my favorites in audiobook form though. I tend to hover around classics (pretty much only Hemingway and Faulkner though), sci-fi, fantasy, drama, and historical fiction. Seems like these would lose something in translation. I don’t doubt there are many, many very well done audiobooks in these categories though.

Which brings me to my question...

Which books are best read and which books are good, or at least harmlessly done, in audiobook form?

flpu46,mortandsmallgods,Your Thoughts About Books With 'Interconnected' Narratives?,"Think of Cloud Atlas, Naked Lunch, A Visit From The Goon Squad, I, Robot, The Things They Carried. Some are inter-linked short stories, whereas others are more obvious in how narrative points are connected. This trend is rather popular in literary fiction, and I'm debating whether that's a good or a bad thing. 

So here's a thread to discuss 'interconnected' stories and an opportunity to suggest favourites, or to review relevant books that you've read. 

A positive of the form is that multiple characters allows a variety of viewpoints and locations, and when done right, can add thematic depth. 

A negative is that the author doesn't really explore any particular angle in significant detail. In terms of emotional engagement- you'll find yourself liking some stories more than others. 

Other critiques people have of interconnected narratives (which I don't really share) is pretentiousness, and randomness for the sake of it.

flok9a,3PMbreakfast,Circe by Madeline Miller: Did I Miss Something?,"I recently finished this highly lauded novel, and enjoyed it a lot. It was a fun, well paced, interesting story, and it was neat to revisit all the old names from my high school days when I learned about mythology. 

That being said, I feel like I missed something. Circe is on every 2019 reading list. It was at the front of every book store for months. It’s so often recommended I was expecting some high level themes and some kind of commentary on today’s society or something. The story was a fun fiction to read, but that was it. I’m wondering if I’m just dense (which is absolutely possible), or if this is maybe a case of a book with wide appeal that got hyped, and therefore my expectations were unfairly high. 

I want to be clear I’m not insulting the book. Just want to make sure I’m not missing something that really resonated with others. How did you feel about it?",7,1584677783,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flok9a/circe_by_madeline_miller_did_i_miss_something/,books,1

flnqtl,thelittlestrummerboy,I'm glad I made it through The Fellowship Of The Ring,"I've never been a fan of fantasy as a genre in just about any medium. Things like Game Of Thrones never appealed to me as a show or book series. I don't even enjoy games like Skyrim, etc... very much. That being said, there's a lot of books I never read that are on my ""just read it at least once"" list. 

Now that I have a lot of time off (I'm a cook, no working from home for me) I've been able to read plenty. I've been slogging through the fellowship of the ring for the last month or so and, like everything else fantasy based, it really wasn't clicking. I was pretty bored throughout most of it if I'm being honest, but so many people I know love the series so much that I just kept reading. 

I finished the first book yesterday and was surprised at how much the last 20 pages roped me in. I'll keep it spoiler free but I really liked how it played out and picked up The Two Towers right away.

That being said, I read over 100 pages today alone and am excited to keep going tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

I should probably start with what i didn't like because i loved almost all of it:

* The first chapter was a little boring at first but picked up a little.
* I liked the story of the Hamilton in the second chapter but the Trasks stole the show so hard that when it went back to Hamilton i got a little bored again.

&amp;#x200B;

What makes this book so great so far is the characters. Everyone from the army crazy father to the woman beating pimp is sympathetic in their own way (except Cathy). I knew I liked the book when Cyrus told his son he knew where he would hide, but I knew I LOVED the book with the letter Charles writes his brother. There are parts of the like the letter that are very dark in what they imply. Like when I read the passage about all those ¨household chores¨ Cathy did and realized what she was planning, or everything else about her chapter.

&amp;#x200B;

some more stuff i love:

* The part where Charles tries to kill Adam was great

flkelh,lukejmcgrath,The Blue Lotus,"Tintin has long played a part in my life, through the large comic-style albums I owned as a child, to the reissued collection I’m halfway through today. In between there’s been the old cartoon series of films and the 2011 motion capture experiment from Steven Spielberg.

What grounds my love of Tintin is my own adventure creating a comic in primary school. Called The Giggle, I wrote and drew about half an issue each week with two friends. After collecting a series of A4 sheets of paper, my dad would photocopy them at work and we’d staple then distribute them around school. We didn’t produce many, but they were a labour of love.

On leaving the school, and so my tenure as the comic’s sole editor, one of my teachers bought me a copy of Explorers on the Moon as a thank you for giving him The Giggle each week. As soon as I read the story, my fascination with the little Belgian reporter began.

The Blue Lotus is the fifth title in the Adventures of Tintin series and follows on from the previous collection, Cigars of the Pharaoh. Many consider the story the best in the canon. Beginning in India, The Blue Lotus follows Tintin as he uncovers a mystery surrounding Shanghai and the opium trade. As the reporter digs deeper, he finds plans running far deeper than drug smuggling and stumbles across some old friends.

The beauty of The Blue Lotus is more than a collection of parts, it’s the wider success of the format itself. In taking an already well-worn character and placing him in a tightly plotted adventure with high stakes, sharp drawing, sparse dialogue and clever imagery, Herge created a masterpiece of any type of novel.

After writing my reviews, I like to read what others have written about the book and tend to reference one or two comments in my own article. With The Blue Lotus I’ve found it difficult to find good writers talking about the book, leading me to believe this is because it’s a comic or graphic novel. That’s a shame, as the story quality here is no weaker for it being drawn. The themes, plot and characters work just as well as a regular novel and it’s refreshing to read in another format. I hope that books like this begin to get serious recognition as new writers find voices in major literary publications.

I find it impossible to stay away from Tintin and, once I start, fruitless to try to put one of Herge’s stories down. The Blue Lotus is not my favourite Tintin collection, yet the story itself is one of the best. It deals with international themes of war, politics and crime before you realise what you’re reading. It’s not the first Tintin book you should read, but if you do it’s unlikely that it will be your last.",4,1584661127,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flkelh/the_blue_lotus/,books,1
flke8p,lukejmcgrath,The Big Sleep,"Much like my introduction to Tintin, I was first passed a copy of The Big Sleep by a favourite teacher. This time is was well into Secondary School, either GCSE or A Level years and it was my English teacher, Mr Dawson. Beyond my family, he was most responsible for both my love of reading and long-standing dream of writing my own stories.
Following a class reading of The Adventure of the Speckled Band, which I’d read before and was something of a naïve expert on, he brought a copy in and offered it to me as a loan. For some reason, the book sat in my room until he gently reminded me that he’d need it back. Shocked at my forgetfulness, I raced through the pages in a few nights and returned in the same week.

The connection to Sherlock Holmes seemed at once clear and distant. The novel’s detective, Phillip Marlowe, is as determined, intelligent and single-minded as his predecessor. Yet, this was something new too. He was involved in his case like Holmes rarely seemed to be, messing around with victims and suspects. Where Holmes intervened to solve a crime, Marlow almost seems to propel it forward and wasn’t too bothered with loose ends. Without Mr Dawson and that book loan, I might not have come to appreciate detective fiction’s diversity.

The Big Sleep, I soon learned many years ago, is the first novel to feature Phillip Marlowe. Published in 1939, it builds an a number of Chandler’s many short stories featured in Black Mask. The story follows the Private Detective as he investigates the blackmail of a wealthy family’s wild-child daughter. Before long, Marlowe uncovers much more than he’d being paid to find and the bodies start mounting up.

In truth, the plot of the novel is only marginally relevant. It’s purposefully loose and messy, something Chandler makes no apology for. The real genius is in the atmosphere of mystery, double-dealing and noir that the author builds with every turning page. Perhaps even more so, the flawless characterisation of the deeply flawed central character (even here I hesitate from labelling Marlow as our hero as he’s no such thing, although more riotous than he’d care to admit).

Genius is a strong word but highly used with Chandler, who has long since shaken off any reputation for writing ‘detective fiction’. In his review of the novel, Robert McCrum quotes another literary titan:
The Big Sleep transcends its genre, moving WH Auden to write that Chandler’s thrillers “should be read and judged, not as escape literature, but as works of art”.

Reading The Big Sleep is essentially to understanding why we read anything. It’s a mix of pure entertainment, mystery and literary art. There’s a reason its been chosen in top 100 lists by Time, Le Monde and The Guardian. Consider this essay your personal English teacher, reaching out with an opportunity to change how you think about what novels can achieve.",11,1584661090,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flke8p/the_big_sleep/,books,0

fljm3c,BigBootyBear,People who have read World War Z by Max Brooks - how much of what happened in the book you've noticed to play out IRL in our current crisis?,"I have read that book maybe 10 times. Every day passes and I get chills to my core on how much of what happened in the book has played out in real life.

To those that haven't read World War Z: It's a book about the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. A journalist from the UN interviews many people that lived through the ""Z War"". Unlike most zombie stories, WWZ describes the beginning, middle and end of the zombie apocalypse (95% of all zombie films just focus on the middle).

I don't want to spoil the book for anyone that has not read it, but it's great. Remove the ""zombies"" part and you will feel like reading a history book written in 2120 about the Coronavirus pandemic.

Yes the pandemic in the book involves zombies, but everything else - The Great Panic, the gag orders and censorship, the misinformation, false cures, the aloofness of the population, the fact it also originated in goddamn China...

The reason I loved the book so much was that unlike the your run of the mill Z apocalypse movie, it felt soo real. Like it actually happened. And when the Coronavirus epidemic begun I assumed some things will play out like they have in the book. But I didn't imagine **so many things would be the same.**

I kind of wish I haven't read it. Predicting so much of what happened weeks before is disheartening and scary, even though it has helped me prepare my family.

The name, Barry Soetero, by the way is the name that many far-right pundits say is the real name of President Obama. The author clearly had a political agenda (fortunately, I borrowed the book from the library, so the author didn't get any of my money). 

Writing with a political agenda is fine, but that should be clear in the title or dust jacket.

Anyone else run into this?

flh94d,Introscopia,What the h*ck is up with the ending of The Lathe of Heaven??,"Okay. Chapter 9. Orr has a different dream. He meets an alien who teaches him a magic word. He regains his stability of mind, ""He was back where he belonged"". He wakes up and tells Haber He cannot let him continue to use his dreams. He stands firm and confident for the first time in the novel. Haber gives him an ultimatum: be back here tomorrow or else. He replies, defiant: ""I'll come."" I got shivers from that line.

In my mind this was a clear setup for the final confrontation, Orr has learned to control his dreams, but not in the same sense that Haber controls them. A more holistic, Taoist sort of control, which is much more Ursula's style. Haber is destroyed by his own hubris, the world is restored to some acceptable level of normalcy, Orr and Lelache live happily ever after.

Chapter 10. 

Actually George has not gained confidence or control or anything of the sort. He wanders around feeling lost, disconnected from reality. He talks to another alien, this encounter adds nothing new to his understanding of his condition. Back home he falls asleep to a Beatles record and dreams Lelache back into existence. Ok. ""everyone needs a little help from their friends"" is a nice message. This is fine.

They go to Haber's office. This is it. As Haber puts him under, Orr mutters his magic word. And then.... Nothing. He wakes up, Haber's induction worked, he has done away with Orr's power, and now has the ability to reproduce it in himself. The magic word did nothing, sure, it summoned Lelache, but she is sitting there doing nothing! And then, Orr and Lelache JUST WALK OUT OF THE OFFICE. What? The fuck? Orr knows perfectly well what he's going to do with that power. And he just leaves. Before they're even out of the building, reality starts crumbling around them. We get that awesome sequence of Orr fighting the nightmare to get to the machine and shut it down.

And that's that. 

Haber is a mad scientist whose mad creation destroys him. Textbook poetic justice. But he takes everyone else down with him! We all get to live in Haber's mangled world! Ursula teases us with another scene of Orr going to sleep, but it's true, his power is really gone. We get the happily ever after with Lelache, but the world is broken and Orr learned nothing. Also Lelache doesn't have the memories from the other timelines, so Orr gets to live the rest of his life carrying that burden alone. Yay.

I really wish we'd gotten some kind of symbolic victory for Orr... Haber puts him under. he mutters the word. Haber is making speeches at Lelache as the world starts changing around them. He tries desperately to fiddle with his machines, but they disappear before his eyes...

OR, how about this, Haber succeeds, Orr does lose the power. That actually puts a neat little bow on the story. But! As he leaves the office, he uses the alien words to plant an induction in Haber's mind, as they exit the building reality is restored back to normal, *cool guys don't look at explosions* style.

OR, what if Lelache actually had some meaningful role to play in this climax? What if her heavy purse and bangles and stuff turned out to be a Chekhov's gun, and she bunks Haber in the head with them? I think we could have used some more physicality and humor in the ending.

I don't know! I just really got this weird feeling about the last two chapters. Like she had written the book up to Ch.9 and then came back years later and wrapped it up for the publishers. I was very bewildered.

On the other hand, when watching a subtitled show/movie (eg. anime), I can glance up from a separate task for a fraction of a second and process two sentences in an instant. I also seem to process emails much more quickly than books.

I should note that when I do read, I vouch for philosophy or self-improvement genres.

This sudden solitude compels Joan to assess her life for the first time ever and face up to many of the truths about herself. Looking back over the years, Joan painfully re-examines her attitudes, relationships and actions and becomes increasingly uneasy about the person who is revealed to her…

I admit I first hated the book. I wasn't used to reading dark or moody books, and even though I read the synopsis and knew it's going to be different from her usual books, I expected something mysterious. It's not. Everything is unravelled slowly, and the readers, along with Joan, know what's coming. The atmosphere is heavy, and suffocating. It's a book I cannot describe (I'm terrible at that anyway) but the theme of the book is so similar to the situation we are in that I thought I must share it.

flcmhn,GizmosArrow,I finished Stranger in a Strange Land for the first time this week. A few thoughts.,"I only knew Heinlein from Starship Troopers, which I only knew at first from the movie. Completely different book, but it was still an entertaining read. 

This last week I finished Stranger in a Strange Land and I really enjoyed it. Instantly thought it was a classic and deserved to be mentioned in company of others like 1984 and Brave New World. There were a lot of similarities in concept and style. Same focus on how organizations/religions can skew and manipulate. Also, these classic dystopian/utopian books really focus a lot on sex, and I contributed it to the times. Lots of exploration of sex and concepts of modesty and freedom. Also, women really got painted into a corner, didn't they? In Stranger and in 1984/Brave New World. Heinlein kept having his characters refer to them as little girls, and they were pretty much fembots that served dinner, took orders, and had sex. 

Michael was an interesting character with an interesting arc from almost childlike to almost innocently (?) manipulative and controlling. I liked him at first, understood his reasoning throughout, but came to kind of hate him in the end. Which made me reflect on time and the concept of living so long and being so connected that discorporating wasn't a big deal. 

Not sure I got all of the heaven and angel stuff. Was he Michael the Archangel? Was he just a man raised Martian who had metaphysical powers? He was able to teach people his ways. Does time make fools of us all?

Overall, again, I'm convinced it's just as good as books like 1984 and Brave New World. In fact, I think I enjoyed it more than 1984.",29,1584634391,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flcmhn/i_finished_stranger_in_a_strange_land_for_the/,books,1

flbn4v,HorcruxSeeker,Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler,"I read Butler's Parable of the Sower for the first time about a month ago.  Since then it's been stuck in my head for many reasons.  Initially, the Earth Seed development and growth was truly fascinating and still is to think about.  The narrative itself was engaging, entertaining, and likewise thought provoking throughout.  Butler's crumbling collapse of society felt like logical extensions of societal behaviors and provided its destruction in a very well thought-out and logical manner.

With everything going on the past week or so the book is on my mind even more.  Certainly the Earth Seed teachings are floating around and Lauren's general sense to PREPARE and SURVIVE, but the unsettling part to me is how close the book actually mimicked real life since it's publication in the early 90s. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We can get ready.  That's what we've got to do now.  Get ready for what's going to happen, get ready to survive it, get ready to make a life afterward. Get focused on arranging to survive so that we can do more than just get batted around by crazy people, desperate people, thugs, and leaders who don't know what they're doing!

I'm not trying to raise the alarm here or signal this as the collapse of everything.  This book had been on my mind a lot and for many good (and non current event) reasons.  There are certainly prophetic parts of the book and in light of what's happening now it is somewhat unsettling.  Still, the book does provide hope in the face of darkness and destruction and it certainly drives home that society hinges on the balancing act between the individual's responsibility to society at large - which may at times seemingly be in contrast with the individual's goals or gain.

Hopefully this provides us a chance to acknowledge and harness Change to better prepare ourselves for survival in the future.",7,1584630882,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flbn4v/parable_of_the_sower_by_octavia_butler/,books,1

Growing up, I'd skim stuff for school and then usually come out with a B/C grade on anything involving the books. I just never could do it.

He recommended I try this book out and I'm so glad I did because now I've been reading a lot more. I've read 5 books so far this year and that is HUGE for me given the fact that I probably never read 5 books for fun in my entire life.

Sorry if this triggers all you attention seeking hipsters on forums like these who boast about reading 100+ books a year, but fictional literature in particular is dead. No one will be studying anything written post 2000 in twenty years time, let alone a century from now. Literature is not nearly as good as it was in the 19th century. It's been downhill since.

But don't take it personally book nerds, all creative outputs have their peaks and their degeneration. It's not just books, but cinema and music as well that have turned to fecal matter. Far  superior storytelling can be found in television and gaming.

So put down your crappy millennial books and find far better fields of storytelling. That, or get a life.",5,1584628231,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flaxlu/its_not_a_tragedy_that_more_and_more_people_are/,books,1
flasgf,vilianP,I Finished Heir of Fire and Was Blown Away Once Again!,"Recently, I began reading the *Throne of Glass* series by Sarah J. Maas. **How did I figure out the existence of it?** That is a pretty interesting story, so let me start with it first and get to my impressions.

About two months ago I went into a local bookstore and started searching for something that would grab my attention. I stayed there, looking at the shelves for more than an hour, but at last something caught my attention. I looked at it and saw: *Kingdom of Ash*. It grabbed my attention *(I knew it beforehand from friends who had told me it was a pretty cool book)* and I immediately bought it.

The moment I came back home, I ***grabbed the book*** and started reading. *Excitement, excitement, excitement!* I read the first 50 pages in not time, but then I realised something.

""What the F?"", I said to myself. ""I understand nothing of this stuff that is going on here. Who are these guys?""

Then I close the book, turn it around and see the **big fat 7** on the side of it.

""Oh...""

At that moment I hoped I hadn't screwed up buying the last book of a series that I haven't even read the first book of.

The next day, however, ***I got book 1***, and read it for a week - not so fast, not so slow. Not going to lie, it started off kind of slowly, but then took off and the ending got me in desire for more. I loved *Celaena Sardothien*'s personality, reactions, friends (that is the exact kind of girls I am into, but not that is the point), I loved how the timeline unraveled and uncovered cases that were unimaginable for me.

**With one word, I enjoyed the book and bought the second one.** *Crown of Midnight*

Same thing, but my feelings were enhanced, I loved and hated some of the dialogues, characters and cases. There were many scenarios that I had no idea how she will survive the situation, but Sarah always managed to come up with the best outcome... I enjoyed the book even more than the first one and the ending... *The ending got me wanting more. Like... Like a* ***drug.***

**There we go... Book 3.** *Heir of Fire*

I shall start off without any spoilers, but then will include some things that totally blew me away.

* The plot had both **expected** and **unexpected** scenes.
* Even though I had feelings for what would happen, I was still **captivated** by way presenting it.
* Every. Single. Chapter. Ended on a **cliffhanger.**
* Sarah understood that she was using a plot technique she had used before, but that was no defect of the book - she ***managed to make something great out of it.***
* Last, but definitely not least, ***the ending***... I mean, I believe Sarah is a goddess at writing a perfect ending that would want you to immediately start off the next book.

However, this time I expected a strong ending, as it was in the other books, so bought the fourth book. 

But, hell! ***Such an ending!*** I did not expect such an ending! At one moment I was at my bed and reading peacefully, and at another I was ***shouting with amaze!*** Now that I am writing that I realize how funny it might have looked if someone else was with me... Okay, that is enough with no spoilers. Here I go:

&gt;!Hello, people who have read Heir of Fire. I hope you understand my feelings.!&lt;

&gt;!Honestly, I knew Celaena was Aelyn Galathynius. Her meeting Rowan had me believe that they had something in common. It was obvious for me - the behaviour, ancestors, etc. It kind of reminded me with the story of Celaena and Chaol. Actually, It was almost the same in an idea point of view. This becoming a real strong friendship I could foresee. !&lt;

&gt;!I loved how Dorian Havilliard understood Celaena and even was able to move on with Sorscha. And because of this girl that walked in his life he was able to understand Chaol. That, I believe is even one of the reasons he would sacrifice his own self because of his best friend (that is the part when I was shouting).!&lt;

&gt;!Okay, the ending. WHAT?! THAT HAPPENED? I know it was the only way, but it all came down as a damned lightning to me. So fast!!&lt;

&gt;!Edion, Chaol, Dorian, Sorscha and the king. In one room! He knew? Or he was just bluffing? It does NOT matter! His plans worked out perfectly... Unfortunately...!&lt;

* &gt;!Edion's sacrifice! That is a man! He did not say a word about his plans with Chaol and even if he doomed himself to never seeing his beloved cousin Aelin ever again he knew what was stronger than his desire. That was love. He sacrificed himself in the name of love! Celaena and Chaol's. I don't know if you are a Dorian or Chaol kind of person, but I am definitely a Chaol one.!&lt;
* &gt;!Sorscha's death... Yeah... That sucks. I did not expect her to be caught. I did not expect her to have been sending letters to the rebels. That was a wow moment for me. Also... Heartbraking... Another aspect of love, but the destructive one.!&lt;
* &gt;!Dorian... He could hide his powers at first, but he could not emotionally bear the loss of his greatest friend - he called him a king nonetheless! It seems as he could finally understand his motifs - he did everything in order to protect Dorian. Now it was Dorian's turn. I loved that moment! (That was when I was shouting the loudest)!&lt;
* &gt;!Chaol's reaction to it all - a perfect one for a man with honor. I don't have much to say, I just hope he saves Dorian and gets together with his beloved.!&lt;
* &gt;!The king... What can I say... Just an awful being.!&lt;

&gt;!I have one question though - What was the sword Rowan threw in the sea at the end? Was it the one he served Maeve with?!&lt;

&gt;!One of my favorite quotes: ""And then I am going to rattle the stars."" - C.S. / A.G.!&lt;

That is all I wanted to say. Thank you for sparing some time to read my post and I have to go now. **Why?**The ending of the book got me on yet another cliffhanger, so I am writing this post and immediately starting it.",1,1584627665,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/flasgf/i_finished_heir_of_fire_and_was_blown_away_once/,books,1

flaidr,DrDouchebaggins,"Just read Ethical Slut, interesting read","I liked a lot of aspects, but a lot of weird things too. 
It feels like they’re grossly misinterpreting the past to make poly cultures seem woke, but reality is that most poly marriages in and outside of America are just sexist cultures that pass women out to men. Very few have any equality and women rarely have a choice for multiple partners in any part of history lolol 

Also, the thing about kids, sex in front of kids, it mentioned how kids shouldn’t be forced to watch but it’s not necessary bad for them to watch? That seems so wrong to me, I know it’s my culture, but it’s a child. Why would you want them to see? 

It’s an interesting view and the authors are very on the extreme side of poly, so it feels like they’re speaking from an educated place but not a real, practical one that most Americans or people period will ever experience. Being from California, they obviously have access to wayyy more people and progressive ideas than most of the entire world does at any given time. 

Also, they seemed to focus so much on women, like it’s a tool for women to be empowered. There were topics that seem vaguely sexist, like they never address sexism itself in the culture or how sexist some fetishes may intrinsically be, such as rape play. 

All in all, I’d give it like a 6/10. They could have been more practical and for being educated and being informative, they didn’t have any sources or anything. 

Anybody else read this? Thoughts on it? I’m interested to see how poly and non-monogamous cultures will shape America since they’re definitely trending right now.

While I was in queue for the boarding pass, there was this tall hot girl in front of me in a mini skirt. Wearing a mini skirt in the winter needs some guts, I thought to my self.

&amp;#x200B;

That too something that looked more of a micro than a mini , not the fitting type but a little flared one. I guess everyone standing behind her was wishing that she drops something from her hand and bends down to pick it. Again my bad luck that I was right behind her and not further behind. The view of a miniskirt when you are right next to the girl is nothing much to enjoy.

&amp;#x200B;

The queue dragged on and I guess the only thing that made the waiting time worthwhile was the miniskirt, or rather say whatever was not covered by it. It was a red skirt, I wondered, what color her panties would be. To while away the time I wondered what it would be like to make my fingers travel up her thighs and discover the color of her panties.

&amp;#x200B;

   Another potential thought was , what if there are no panties in there. Will it be a smooth landing or would there be bushes. Realizing that is she is daring to wear a micro/mini in winter , it would have to be a smooth landing inside there and my guess would be that there has to be panties to save her pussy from the chill. I wonder if I said it loud because she turned around and looked at me quizzically , and from there on she turned and looked at me a few times till the time she reached at the counter.

&amp;#x200B;

  Each of us took our boarding cards one after another and marched on towards security screening. Didn’t see her after that for the 30 minutes I waited for the boarding. And as bad luck would have it , the flight was announced to be delayed by another 1 hour because of fog and poor visibility. I walked around the lounge trying to locate her and get a better view of her hot legs, but she was nowhere to be found. I wondered if she was just a figment if my imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

   Time flies in such situations and finally boarding was announced. I waited for most people to enter and went in only when almost all had boarder. Inside, the flight was full. When I reached my seat , all three were empty and I had the middle seat. And there was no passenger behind me waiting for a seat. I guess my luck just turned better. I might have all the three seat to myself. I put my bag in the overhead bin and took my middle seat and sat like a king would on his throne.

&amp;#x200B;

   I was enjoying my luck, and just as I was , the air hostess announced that the last passenger just boarded and boarding is completed. I waited for the that last passenger to come in and destroy my throne. A tall figure reached my row and said “I have a window seat” . I looked up and saw, it was the same hot girl that was in front of me in the queue. And even before I was able to get up to make way for her, she was already entering the row, facing away and with her back towards me.

&amp;#x200B;

   Her mini skirt just brushed past my face. She sat down and adjusted her skirt, thought there wasn’t much to adjust. She half stood up and adjusted her skirt a bit more, actually she pulled it out from under her ass such that she would not be sitting on the skirt but directly on the seat. I could feel a bit of turmoil inside my pants.

&amp;#x200B;

   All the while I was to busy looking at her skirt that I missed looking at her top. It was a creamy white lightly printed semi-transparent button-down blouse, short enough to show an inch of skin above the skirt. What’s more exciting was the bra she was wearing, it was red and very lacy, lacy enough to show a bit of skin if her blouse is removed. She had a nice pair of tits from how it looked like, didn’t see that before as all I saw before was back of her legs and her silhouette.

&amp;#x200B;

   The flight started to take off by the time I watched her settling down. Once we were airborne she pulled out a light blanket out of her bag and wrapped it around herself, may be the AC was a bit cold for her as compared to the winter chill outside, I mused.

&amp;#x200B;

   I recline my seat and tried to take a nap imagining sensual things about the hot girl by my side. I woke up when she tapped on my shoulder, the tray table in front of her was pulled down and she asked if she could pull down the one in front of me as well so that she could sleep leaning forward.

&amp;#x200B;

   I mechanically agreed without a thought and pulled it down for her. She placed her hands on the two tray tables combined with her elbows outward and put her head down and tried to sleep. My elbows were resting on the armrest and in a few minutes, the sides of her upper body started pressing against my elbows. Initially, it was light and then it was heavier as if she has released the weights of her body. Was it intentional or unintentional I could not make out?

&amp;#x200B;

   A little later she woke up and asked me if it’s ok to lift up the armrest between our seats as it is pressing against her ribs. Before I even agreed she had lifted it. Once again she put her head down and started sleeping. Now I had no place to put my left hand/elbow, so I just placed it on my left thigh. I was wondering if I should take all these as a green signal or is it that she is just a careless and carefree lass. I thought I should wait for her to lead me in if she means it. I was right, I felt a hand on my left thigh, had to be her left hand as her right hand was supporting her head on the tray table in front of me, and the blanked was obstructing all the view.

&amp;#x200B;

Her hand was quite close to my crotch but it was just there and doing nothing, but the presence of her hand so close to my crotch was enough for me to get a feeling of arousal down there. I felt that her hand was very very slowly creeping towards my crotch, or was it my imagination? Her hands hunted for my left hand and held it and lifted it, lifted it till I felt something lacy against the palm of my hand.

&amp;#x200B;

   It just struck me that if something lacy has to touch my palm, it has to be her bra and that also means that her blouse is now open under the blanket. Hesitatingly I squeezed the lacy material lightly, and in response, she lowered her chest and pressed the back of my hands upwards. My quick action would have made her think that I was waiting for this to happen. I took the hint and squeezed her lacy bra and her breast a little more firmly. When I did that she removed her hand and landed it right back on my crotch.

&amp;#x200B;

   I continued the squeezing of her right breast, light, and firm, I felt her nipple harden through the laces. While I was busy squeezing her breast, her fingers were busy unbuttoning the button fly if my trouser. While she was unbuttoning, she was deliberately rolling her hand firmly over my crotch as if she is finding it difficult to unbutton it with one hand. Her rolling hands were making my dick harder and I bet she was feeling it all the while and her rolling was intentional.

&amp;#x200B;

   Cabin lights were dimmed by the hostess and the. Blanket was further covering our acts. She had by now unbuttoned my fly and her hand was entering it, fingers searching for the hardness inside. She found it and started pulling it out of my fly. I was using my finger to tease her nipple through the lace. Trying to make it harder, alternating between squeezing breasts and tracing over nipples. She managed to pull out my hardness and was stroking it now in a slow motion .

&amp;#x200B;

The undulations even in her slow stroking was reflecting a response to the way I was squeezing her breast. A firmer squeeze to her breast was responded with her giving a firmer stroke to my hardness and a gentle tease on her nipple would be responded with her finger teasing the back of tip of my hardness. A slow sync was established and it was like I am guiding her hands through her breast and it was a different feeling this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

While fumbling to find a way into her right lacy bra so that I could feel her bare breast and nipple, my hand reached the middle of the breasts and something metallic brushed my finger. That very moment she tightened her grip on my hardness. As I moved my fingers away from that metallic thing she loosened her grip, indicating to me that it was something important there. I fumbled with the metallic thing in her bra between her breast and she tightened her grip on my dick, indicating to me to do something with it.

&amp;#x200B;

   It was a moment later I realized that it was a front open bra. I fumbled with the hook again and released it. The bra burst open with the weight of her breasts hanging into it. Now they were hanging free and bare.

&amp;#x200B;

   I touched each of them one by one and squeezed lightly, and teased each nipple. Both nipples were hard and teasing them was responded with nice firm strokes and teasing on my dick. After a little foreplay with her breasts, I dared a bit by placing my hand on her thighs, just below where her skirt ended, which was still very high on her thighs. She spread her thighs a bit indicating that I was going in right direction and started stroking my dick a bit faster. I started stroking my fingers on her thighs. With every stroke, I was moving my fingers higher up on her thighs. Every time getting closer to her crotch.

&amp;#x200B;

   In about 10 strokes, I managed to touch her crotch and found that there was nothing between my fingers and her crotch as opposed to my guess that there would be a panty. Was she not wearing it when she was in the queue or did she remove it later, was what I started wondering. I felt the wetness from her pussy on my fingers. As I stroked downward, her wetness on my fingers dried as it spread on to her thighs. I think she felt good as her hands were working more magic on my dick. In my next stroke, I lingered my fingers near her crotch and gathered more wetness by playing a little with her pussy lips. And then stroked down her other thigh. I was further encouraged by a firm swirling stroke in my dick.

&amp;#x200B;

   I placed my fingers on her pussy as if covering them and then bent my middle finger and slowly entered it into her wet pussy, and slowly moved it in and out. It was a slow fuck, slow firm and steady and she was reciprocating with the same rhythm on my dick. Every time she reached on the top of my dick she would swirl her fingers around the top as if she is opening a bottle and that was driving me to the edge of cumming and yet not enough to cum. I would lightly drag my finger over her clits as I pull it out of her pussy each time, her hips had started moving in the same rhythm as my fingers were fucking her pussy. And at the time she would squeeze her thighs trapping my fingers deep in her pussy.

&amp;#x200B;

   I really wished I could use my right hand to tease her nipples and squeeze her breast , at least the right one. She shifted her position a bit to help me reach her breast. Her nipples were still hard. I started rolling the right nipple between my fingers I increased the intensity of my finger fucking her and she I increased the firmness and speed of stroking my dick. In some time we both were ready to come, a firmer strike by her and squeezing of her thighs confirmed to me that she was also ready to come and in a moment we both came. It was the most silent orgasm I had and probably the most silent organs she had . Neither of us would forget that we are inside a plane and there are passengers on the other side of aisle who might notice.

&amp;#x200B;

   I could feel the strength of her orgasm in the way she squeezed her thighs. She had almost crushed my hands in her crotch. She slowly opened her thighs and released my hand. My hands were completely drenched in her pussy juices. She guided my hand to wipe on her skirt itself. I closed my eyes and re-imagined the whole thing right from the time she was standing in front of me in the queue. Now the knowledge that I had that she had no panties all the while made me feel aroused once again.

&amp;#x200B;

   I was wondering how it would be to feel so naked under such a small skirt without any panties , and as I was aroused imagining this , I felt her hands on my dick again , stroking me again. She turned her head towards me and asked me if I was thinking about her being without party standing in front of him in the queue. And I nodded yes, and she said that my dick had already answered that question. She told me to put my finger back in her pussy and just keep it there without moving. And she just held on to my dick for the rest of the flight. With an occasional stroking to keep me hard and an occasional movement of my fingers to keep her wet. When the captain announced the descent of the flight for landing , she pushed my dick back into my trouser and I quickly pulled out my finger from her pussy and buttoned up my fly.

&amp;#x200B;

   She pulled of her bra and buttoned up her blouse , her breast and nipples clearly visible through the semi-transparent material of the blouse when looked at closely . She put the blanket and her bra in the bag, pulled out a lacy thong and pulled it on. It was a red one too. The bra, the skirt and the thong, a perfect match. When she got up after landing, there was a very wet patch on the seat. She got up even before I did and got past me into the aisle and just walked away, no good bye or no other gesture. Her hips swaying and surely arousing the many men who were still seated by the aisle and many of them wondering if she is wearing panties under that skirt.

&amp;#x200B;

   I roamed around the city for some time and reached my hotel and picked up my keys from the reception and entered my room. I kicked of my shoes and pulled of my clothes and walked into the shower , where my fiancee was already having a shower. I hugged her from behind and cupped her breast , and whispered into her ears that she looked hot in the shower. Holding her breasts in both hands, I told her that her tits are beautiful. She turned towards me and kissed me on my lips and then I whispered into her ear – “hope the stranger on plane treated you well” and she replied “yes and hope the mini skirt was short enough for your liking” and we kissed each other again. She held my dick once again and started giving me a slow sensual blowjob, it was a heavenly experience .

&amp;#x200B;

   After that, we got into the bed and fucked each other very hard. The flashing images of what we did in a plane made me harder and made her wetter. It was the best fuck we had till then. In the morning she woke me up holding my dick with a morning wood firmly in her hands, she asked me, “so what’s going to be our next sex adventure” I smiled and said, as soon as we can find a shorter tighter skirt for you and she smiled back a knowing smile.",0,1584612320,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fl7lsw/sex_on_flight/,books,1

fl3hoi,Red_inSaree,Just finished reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen,"And as silly as it may sound it caused a minor upset within me. It started to make me think back to those teenage years of having crushes and feeling all those anxiety inside me that I used to take it as “spark.”

And for some reason I was craving it again and it took my husband a few sessions of counseling to finally get back to normal state of mind. When I had turned 19, I had given up on crushing when I realized my unhealthy pattern so I was surprised this book triggered it again. I remember a customer mentioned when he heard of this is that you cannot expect such “feelings” because these are human creation. Something along that line.


Other than that mini episode, I really enjoyed this book. I have started to really enjoy books like these that sort of make me slow down and remind me to enjoy the ordinary. 

My phone use has been no more than 25 minutes since I started reading this book. 

Not necessarily because I have been reading for like three hours day but also because I started to voluntarily do offline activities rather than just binge watch shows on Netflix or listening to podcasts all day long.

fl1i7c,thankyouforfu,"The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Past Decade (2010-2014)","Hey guys, I'm back with a new list in addition to my recent post covering the last 5 years:



 [The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)](https://old.reddit.com/r/horrorlit/comments/f7879h/the_best_horror_books_novels_and_stories_of_the/) 



Thus, this expands the total ""Best Of"" to the last ten years, encompassing 2010-2019 (i.e. the list below is for 2010 through 2014, and the link above is for 2015-2019).



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



It's always nice to have one place to find recommendations, and unfortunately it's often difficult to find said places, so I have created one based on what I've found to be considered \*\*AWARD-WORTHY HORROR NOVELS\*\*. 



*Essentially, these are the horror stories that were nominated for and/or won horror awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*


One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:



[http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books\_index.asp](http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp)



For the above site, you should be eyeing these major horror awards:



- Bram Stoker Award



- Shirley Jackson Award



- August Derleth Award (British based)


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:


http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&amp;awyr=2019




Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for horror, so I have taken as many horror novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).


https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2014



I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything.

I also did a list for the best Science Fiction novels and stories of the last 5 years which you can find here:

fl15j1,cbandy,The Catcher in the Rye at 15 and 30,"I imagine something similar has been posted before, but it’s amazing how differently The Catcher in the Rye reads when you’re 15 and then when you’re 30.

At 15: “This Holden guy really knows what he’s talking about. Fuck society!”

At 30: “What stuck up, ignorant, whiny little bitch.”

It’s pretty brilliant. When I read it as a kid, the book was a monument to my inflated sense of self-worth. Now, it reminds me of what it was like to be so sure of myself as a kid - or at least to act that way outwardly - but to be scared stiff on the inside.

fkzo92,styx248,Are there other readers who just love every single book they've read?,"Am I the only person who, it seems, loves every book they have ever read? I don't research books beforehand or pick out ""good"" books, and yet it seems like I love every book. I have never put down a book and thought it sucked, don't have a preferred genre or category.

fkzmvo,lukejmcgrath,And Then There Were None,"The second Agatha Christie novel on my list of books I want to read, And Then There Were None joins The Murder of Roger Ackroyd as one of the most famous detective stories ever written. Adapted many times over the years, it’s her best-selling novel and her most recognised, yet doesn’t feature Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple.

My first memory of And The There Were None is a play and not the book, though I seem to have known about the story before taking my seat. This is many years ago and my memory clouds the two things together. We sat very high in the theatre, I think in the back row, and the stage and actors looked like miniatures before I got used to the height. It was the first play I saw, my parents took me, and I was amazed. I still remember being frightened by an unexpected gunshot midway through.

The clearest part of that memory are the ten figures on the stage, which would disappear one-by-one as characters were killed off. After the first departed, I looked and looked for signs of some stagehand sneaking on in all black to silently remove one. No matter how hard I tried to focus, the play would always pull me back in and I never saw the sleight of hand take place.

The novel itself, published in 1939, tells the story of a group of 10 strangers brought together and stranded in a grand house on an island. Whilst they await their host, a record plays accusing each of being responsible for a series of deaths, from careless driving to suffocation. Tensions rise and suspicion builds until, one by one, the visitors are murdered in a way that follows the pattern of a nursery rhyme hung around the island house.

Much like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, I won’t talk about the plot in any detail as it’s the star of the show. Christie builds an intricate house of cards that’s just real enough to believe and just crazy enough to make you wonder if it could be done. As Laura Thompson describes it, And Then There Were None is “like a machine ticking remorselessly towards the endgame.” Everything is built with precision towards the stark and terrifying idea of systematic serial murder.

The real joy of And Then There Were None is in re-reading the novel to see if you can find any holes or loose threads in the story. Christie’s skill as a storyteller is so great that with each re-read you still get drawn to the characters and never quite catch sight of the stagehand.",20,1584574343,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fkzmvo/and_then_there_were_none/,books,1

fkzj28,lukejmcgrath,Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,"It seems strange that I have never read Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland before, in fact I had always thought the title to be Alice in Wonderland as most films based on the novel are. The short book feels like a childhood memory, yet to my knowledge I have never read it before, or had it read to me.
Like many, it’s the 1951 Disney film that means the most to me in the canon of Alice adaptations. Reading the original story for the first time, it’s clear that the text serves as inspiration and a licence to create rather than truly adapt. Many elements considered ‘classic’ Alice such as Tweedledum and Tweedledee are don’t appear in the novel (these two are from the sequel, Through the Looking Glass.
First told to three young girls, one called Alice, Lewis Carroll created the story that became Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland in 1862. Over time, he wrote down the short 15,000-word tale and expanded it to almost twice the length. The book was published in 1865 with original illustrations by Punch cartoonist John Tenniel.
Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is probably the most famous example of nonsense literature. Its loose plot follows Alice as she enters the underground world of Wonderland and meets an array of unusual characters. Constantly changing size and stumbling into new situations, the story unfolds much like a hazy dream.
Each situation in the story introduces Alice to a mathematical or linguistic concept and it’s these that stand out more than the events, first as nonsense then quite plain and logical.
For example, there’s the semantic lesson:
“Why, you might just as well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘I eat what I see’!”
and the mathematical revelation when Alice contests she can’t have more tea as she hasn’t had any to begin with:
“You mean you can’t take less: it’s very easy to take more than nothing.”
Beyond the language, many of the characters in the novel have transcended the pages into popular culture. The Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts and White Rabbit are often referenced in films and literature today. I image most could conjure up the Queen’s off with their head catchphrase without ever reading the book.
Perhaps most interesting, I found in researching the book that it might not be quite as fantastical as we image. As Oliver Lansley reveals, Carroll suffered from a rare condition “that causes strange hallucinations and affects the size of visual objects, which can make the sufferer feel bigger or smaller than they are.”
Despite the fun of the wordplay and memorable characters, Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland left me cold. Despite its brief word count, the novel took me weeks to read as I never felt excited to continue the story. Perhaps that’s because there is no story as such, more a series of scenes that, for the most part, can be read in any order or without reference to each other. There’s never a sense of the story building to anything, leaving it charming but flat.",7,1584573942,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fkzj28/alices_adventures_in_wonderland/,books,2

fkyy2t,LazyLamedog,"""There was a silly damn bird...""","With this ongoing crisis of the Coronavirus epidemic and all the posts I see while I stay at home and browse reddit, I'm reminded of Granger's speeches in Fahrenheit 451 about the Phoenix and the factory of mirrors. I haven't read Fahrenheit since highschool four years ago, but I do recommend it to others as a good book for reflecting on society and self-destructive human tendencies.

Granger's comment on how we must be able to learn from our mistakes by referencing the self-immolation the Phoenix continually undergoes makes me hopeful that both governments, health authorities, and everyone else alike is able to see the ways this situation could be handled better (less hoarding, better respect for those in 'menial' jobs, etc.).

On the other hand, I think Granger's metaphorical speech on using a mirror factory to ensure humanity really analyzes itself and its direction speaks to the fact that many people seem to be coming away from this situation with a newfound understanding for the struggles faced by healthcare workers, grocery workers and other essential services that they may not have had beforehand. It also seems like many realized the importance hygienic practices and difference a lack of human activity has on the environment.

All I can say personally is if you haven't read this book before, please it a shot despite the reputation it has an overrated dystopian novel. It really does offer some good insights into the effects of distracted, heavily commercialized, over-consuming, and willingly ignorant society on their future. Hopefully we can all come away from this crisis with renewed outlooks on the world and our personal impact on it with our lives, after all, none of us want to be that silly damn bird right?

TL;DR: If you have some time while pent up at home during this pandemic, give Fahrenheit 451 a read and I hope it's enlightening about your views on our current way of living.

I had this kind of thinking towards my own depression, I thought since I wasn't suicidal then I had no business trying to get help for being depressed.

fkxk8g,Speedy567,What Draws You to Classic Literature?,"Hello, folks! I'm just quite curious as to what the appeal of classic Literature is. For me personally, I want to enjoy it, but I often find the thick tomes that carry these stories to be quite dry. On top of th ay I dont tend to get much out of them (lesson wise). For example, the Great Gatsby. I've read it twice and I find it to be... fine. In my opinion the novel itself is good, but not the best book of all time, and I'm struggling to see why people rave about it so much. 

Obviously this is just a product of the generation I've been born into (mostly), for many classic stories really set the mold of what a modern story is today, as well as being the starters of many genres. Orwell's 1984, for instance, is less impactful and appealing to my generation now as it was to the readers in 1949 because before 1984 there wasn't really anything like it. Its influence is seen in many dystopian stories today (the Hunger Games and such). 

I've already kind of answered my own question, but the curiosity still hangs in the air and I want your thoughts on this topic. 

I know some of what I wrote is probably controversial and I'm not the biggest reader (currently trying to devote more time to it) so my grasp on what good literature is probably isn't fully developed yet, so please note that my words don't really carry much weight (I guess).

Edit: Sorry if this is kind of a mess to read. I have a lot that I want to say, but little patience to write and flesh it out.

fkuz03,Sankon,Have begun Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky,"Hello, I've recently started reading this book (in German) and just wanted to share a couple of impressions while they're still fresh. 

The whole sequence after he murders the pawn lady is so vividly written, I can sink into his mental state. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I read it just after waking up after an afternoon nap, so I was in the atmospheric, half dreamlike state between sleep and fully awake. 

Secondly, it is surprisingly easy to read, but I don't recall if an explanation has been offered as to why Raskolinikow is committing illogical actions. He decided to murder the lady just because of some people he overheard discussing how nice it was if she would be dead?",21,1584557930,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fkuz03/have_begun_crime_and_punishment_by_dostoyevsky/,books,0

fkujg7,danellender,I just re-read *The Machine Stops* by E.M. Forster and it's so timely.,"&gt;The clumsy system of public gatherings had been long since abandoned; neither Vashti nor her audience stirred from their rooms. Seated in her armchair she spoke, while they in their armchairs heard her, fairly well, and saw her, fairly well. She opened with a humorous account of music in the pre Mongolian epoch, and went on to describe the great outburst of song that followed the Chinese conquest. Remote and primæval as were the methods of I-San-So and the Brisbane school, she yet felt (she said) that study of them might repay the musicians of today: they had freshness; they had, above all, ideas. Her lecture, which lasted ten minutes, was well received, and at its conclusion she and many of her audience listened to a lecture on the sea; there were ideas to be got from the sea; the speaker had donned a respirator and visited it lately. Then she fed, talked to many friends, had a bath, talked again, and summoned her bed.

By the way, this was published in 1909.

To me this is characteristic of so many books. Their relevance comes from history and ideas repeating themselves over and over. People are in self-isolation watching the movie ""Contagion"" but 50 years ago a book by Michael Crichton called *The Andromeda Strain* was made into a movie.

fksx9z,DangerCloseTuber,IMHO fiction needs more characters who cause chaos without any logical motivation behind their actions,"I'm not talking about abandoning characters with complex story arcs and development, whose actions are guided and easily explainable by logic, experience, convictions or emotional state. Good, neutral or evil, if they're well-thought-out and realistically written, they are what basically any reader would want to find in a book or franchise. Even the most original plot can feel bland if the characters are dull or just plain unrealistic.

Having said that, I also think a portion of works of fiction would serve as a perfect change of pace for many readers, myself included, where the story would revolve around one or more characters who are nearly the complete opposite of logical. They don't do anything for either the good of others or personal gain, but just because they can and it's entertaining. I'll immediately state that I'm not referring to Chaotic evil characters like the Joker, or similar psychopats, sadists, serial killers etc. They are ""logically motivated"" by the urges which are consequences of their mental illness. No, I'm talking about what an average gamer does when they first pick up Skyrim or GTA - go on a completely senseless killing spree, steal whatever they see, provoke or start fights with random strangers, and generally spread chaos, violence and destruction. D&amp;D players will also be acquainted with ""murder hobo"" type of characters.

They're not really exhibiting psychopatic tendencies (well, at least most of them aren't), but are simply enjoying the freedom of doing anything they want, and testing the reaction of the world surrounding them. Since violence usually provokes quick and strong reactions, people first think of destruction, maiming and killing as the actions they want to preform in such a setting, but an action of that type doesn't necessarily have to be violent, just complely ridiculous, illogical and bizarre. I'll follow up with examples later.

So, this character wouldn't correspond to either a Chaotic evil or a Chaotic neutral alignment. He would fall into what's popularily called Chaotic stupid or Stupid evil. I'm not saying the character itself should be of low intelligence, only that the motives for his actions and general behavior are completely stupid and ridiculous. Since this hypothetical story wouldn't be set in a video game world, but a real one, the meaning and consequences of the character's behavior would have real-life repercussions. Speaking of the plot setting, a character like this could be written into a fantasy world, the real modern or historical world, or a sci-fi one. Maybe the fantasy setting allows the most freedom, as an average person behaving like a raving lunatic probably wouldn't last long in current society, plus the inclusion of magic or some other fantasy mechanics could help the character cause more mischief and chaos, evade law in additional ways etc. However, I can see any setting working, as well as many genres. A fantasy adventure, a crime/action novel, or sci-fi action would be the obvious choices, but I can easily see a character like this being an important part of the plot of a politically-themed novel, a romance, horror, comedy, satire, drama... It would certainly add to originality and undpredictability of the story itself.

Now, such a character would be best fleshed out as either the protagonist or main antagonist, though I can see it working with them being something like a main companion to the protagonist. Giving them only a side role could serve as a sort of comic relief, but it feels like a wasted opportunity... they don't even need to be extremely brutal or evil, as they're not primarily motivated by sadism or an urge to kill per se. They just find it entertaining to make people shocked, mad, sick, hysterical etc. Like ""real life trolling"", only with no moral or legal boundaries. They're also not ""crazy"", at least not in the psychotic sense. They understand reality perfectly.

If it's still unclear what the type of the characters I'm describing actually is, I'll follow up with a few examples:

1. A wandering hero/mercenary in a medieval fantasy setting. He does quests for various people while travelling from town to town, gets paid, explores the world during his adventures, faces different people, creatures, items, magic.... only when he's done questing, he rides back to the town, collects his bounty, then slits the throat of the quest giver for no reason. He also sets their house on fire before leaving in the night. In another town he sits in a tavern with his drink, then simply decides to throw his dagger into the butt of a random patron. Or he wakes up in the middle of the night in a larger city, sneaks outside past the guard patrols, and poops in the well. He can also, for example, draw his bow and shoot a bull in the testicles while the farmers aren't around. The plot, aside from dealing with ""regular"" missions and adventures, would often revolve around him covering his tracks so people don't find out about his crimes and stop hiring him, fighting his way out of a tavern after injuring a stranger, and keeping a straight face while furious townsfolk scoop up human dung from the well.

2. A villain in a crime thriller set in the real world. The protagonist can be a detective, a CSI, whatever. Anyway, they try to connect the dots, design the ciminal's profile, and predict the next crime for the duration of the entire novel, while all the guy/girl does is essentially slitting throats of completely random people in dark alleys, pushing cripples in their wheelchairs into the sea, drugging children during school break, setting city parks on fire, abusing pets, sneaking into restaurants and placing dead animals and their own poop in the food while avoiding cooks.... you name it. Completely random crimes, of various severity, at random times and places, no real connection whatsoever. It would be nearly impossible to connect them all to the same person, let alone predict the next one.

3. A high ranking noble, again in a fantasy setting. He abuses his power and authority, but not for his personal gain, and neither due to simple sadism. He just wants his subordinates to look and feel ridiculous and he enjoys it. Like ordering his guards to patrol the towns naked, having an elite stealth archery unit which sneaks around his domain and shoots at random citizens, cattle and pets, assassins whose only job is to kill the farmer's chickens... When someone breaks the law, there's no prison, but they need to put a bunch of scorpions in their pants and then run around on all fours until they collapse or something. If there's magic, add wizards which transform townsfolk into animals or shrink them, intentionally enchant/curse forests around towns in different ways, poison the entire court with love potions (except the noble of course) and watch the drama unfold etc. All that while suppressing revolts and avoiding unwanted attention from the king.

This is just a tiny fraction of the ideas a creative mind can develop when writing about this type of characters. That's why I'm disappointed to find virtually no existing novels on the topic :(",41,1584550942,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fksx9z/imho_fiction_needs_more_characters_who_cause/,books,2

fkse2o,BagelgooseB2,Lovecraft’s fear of space,"“I have whirl’d with the earth at the dawning,
When the sky was a vaporous flame;
I have seen the dark universe yawning,
Where the black planets roll without aim;
Where they roll in their horror unheeded, without knowledge or lustre or name.”

Why do you all think Lovecraft chose the emptiness of deep space to be the main object of his horror? Was it just because of his particular paranoia, or were there many people living around the same time who found science’s recent placement of the earth in a vast uncaring universe to be nihilistic and terrifying?

I’d also be interested in hearing what people today find most chilling in Lovecraft’s work, considering how prevalent and often optimistic sci-fi can be. Personally I was always more disturbed by the psychological horror than the descriptions of space themselves; stories like The Dreams in the Witch House and The Rats in the Walls involving a rapid descent into madness made me shudder much more than some of the more alien focussed works.

Centuries before the Commedia was written, that human type had already come into being. Erik the Red discovered Greenland around the year 985; his son Leif disembarked in Canada at the beginning of the eleventh century. Dante could not have known this.”

fknw3r,Babrahamlincoln3859,Alan Watts and the Steppenwolf (SPOILERS),"I'm reading Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse for the first time and coincidentally listened to a speech ""relax your mind"" by Alan Watts. 

Alan talks about the the Goo and the Porcupine. The goo (Hermine) who goes through life flowing with the vibration and accepting the flip-flop-ability of it all. While the Porcupine (Harry) tenses against it with no flexibility. 

The Porcupine is a realist, looking at everything in a negative way (golf is just walking around hitting a ball with a stick)

While the goo sees everything in a positive light.

The question was, Which is a better way of living?

In Steppenwolf, Hermine and Harry tend to bring each other to the middle of both of these. They both have bits of their lives where they give in to the other way of thinking.

After finishing the book, I proceeded to review it and mark it as ""Read"". My eyes fell on one of the other reviews, which was apparently written by this person who is apparently in a teaching position. 

He claimed that Santiago Nasar was in fact a Christ figure. And that the fact he was innocent was established ""unequivocally"" in the book. I seemed to have missed it, even though I read it quiet slowly. Can someone point out to me where this happens?

And as a person who grew up in India, the concept of an honour killing is quiet normal to me despite the fact that it has never happened to someone I knew in real life.

fkl2id,beckhamwest_,What is your take on Heidegger's works?,"As far as I've learned from some of his works and a podcast, he definetly demonstrates how assumptions can definetly not only complicate existance but as someone once wrote somewhere —I guess this person is Charles Darwin— completely mislead us into inevitable error and/or incoherence.

Heiddeger proposes that a person essential being (Dasein) is a subject of his culture, social settings, historical situation, etc. (facticity). That this Dasein has possibilities and endeavours defined by chance or some deterministic situation (existentiality and fallingness), somehow like Sartre once defined, we're chained to things inevitably in this fact that is being.

He defines that the more understanding &amp; control we get from being and the things (the thing§[the big machinery]?) the more we alienate ourselves from others, the more clear it is to us that a big deal of everyday talk is full of banalities, that most of us ignore that there's way too much in here &amp; now than we realize.

He's fascinating like Nietzsche, Nietzsche wrote that we've got to rise and stop being objects, start overcoming this dreadful tool (custom, religion, certain doctrines) and start discovering for ourselves a meaningful and tactful existance making sure we exert enough control, that we earn essential knowledge to never fall in the same mistake as Christianism did, as much as possible.

Mine is The Bone  Clocks by David Mitchell \[Random House variant\]. I'm just interested in  what others think, artists, readers, publishers. I have been thinking  about this a lot as I always find myself drawn to specific images and  have foudn that some books come across visually ""cooler"" than the  content actually is. One like this I have to name (if I must) is   Clockwork Angel,  when I looked past the cover I just found that the  book wasn't my type of story.

fkejbg,lukejmcgrath,V for Vendetta,"Although it feels like I’ve I know every scene, I can’t remember a time when I’ve ever sat through the full runtime of 2005’s V for Vendetta film adaptation. Unlike Alan Moore’s Watchman, which I’ve re-read many times over, shared with friends and family (and even enjoyed the Zack Snyder film), V for Vendetta seems more iconic but less welcoming. Where Watchmen is praised for its intricate story, new take on superheroes and broad themes, V seems to become reduced to a series of striking symbols and images.

Telling an alternative history of the 1990’s, V for Vendetta takes place in the aftermath of a nuclear war where a fascist dictatorship governs the United Kingdom. The central story follows Evey, a 16-year-old girl initially rescued from attackers one night by V, an anarchist with plans to bring down the oppressive forces running the country. 

As Evey and V bond and share their life stories, we also join Detective Finch who’s tracking V through several murders. Finch’s investigation begins to reveal a shared connection between the victims and a shady experimental “resettlement” camp V escaped from years earlier. 

As the two build and unusual and unsteady alliance, V reveals more to Evey, pushing her to her limits and putting a choice before her to accept the world as it is or join his cause.  As both V’s plans for revenge against his former captors and desire to lead a rebellion come within reach, an ever-more disillusioned Finch begins to close in. V and Evey must risk everything to fulfil their plans.

The key theme of V for Vendetta is the conflict between fascism and anarchy. Though, while the state is clearly corrupt, evil and self-serving, V is never portrayed as a shining light by comparison. His methods are often cruel, driven by revenge just as much as his desire to liberate the country. 

Perhaps most famously, his indoctrination or mentorship of the teenage Evey is difficult to accept from our protagonist. Much like 1984, which the novel owes a debt to, there’s no clean-cut hero here – just a nameless anarchist telling his story.

That anonymity becomes the point with the most famous and enduring image from V for Vendetta – the emotionless, white Guy Fawkes mask. V’s legacy is the movement he begins, giving the formerly powerless citizens a symbol and cause that lends them the strength to stand up to the government.

The novel is clearly a product of its time, written with Britain ruled by a Conservative government under perhaps our most iconic and certainly most divisive Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. As Sam Jordison noted when rounding up the discussion from a Guardian reading group, “there’s no doubt that the evils of the British Tory party and Thatcherism were preying on Moore’s and Lloyd’s minds when they created the book”.

More recently, and also published by the Guardian, David Barnett hedges this view a little when observing that “even at the height of the Thatcher years, Moore and Lloyd thought that something as epochal as a nuclear war would be necessary before Britain embraced fascism”.

It difficult to tell whether Moore thought that the world depicted in V for Vendetta was a fate already sealed or a potential one that needed illuminating for us to avoid it. Either way, his thoughts feel just a relevant today now that the technology to watch us, listen to our conversations and delivered targeted propaganda is more pervasive than ever.",4,1584484361,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fkejbg/v_for_vendetta/,books,1
fkef19,lukejmcgrath,King Solomon’s Mines,"Written in 1885, King Solomon’s Mines is an adventure novel following Allan Quartermain as he travels across an uncharted Africa searching for a lost man and a mythical treasure. At face value, it’s as simple as that, though like the titular diamond mine there is more buried beneath the surface.The novel holds an odd place in my mind, it’s one I’ve been aware of for as long as I can remember but not with any great reverence. I didn’t consider it a ‘must read’ before I started making more of an effort to read classics, it didn’t bother me that I hadn’t read it and now that I have, I can’t say I was wrong in either opinion. 

Allan Quartermain seemed to have a legacy I was only barely aware of too, yet somehow separate from this, his first and most famous outing. Perhaps that’s more due to his appearance in the flimsy-but-fun League of Extraordinary Gentlemen film and portrayal by Sir Sean Connery.

Quartermain, in Haggard’s universe at least, appears in 13 novels and two collections of stories spanning over 40 years. By various measures, he’s as prevalent as James Bond, Tintin or Sherlock Holmes, but hasn’t quite carried into modern popular culture the same way. Though he’s been adapted into film several times, Connery’s effort is the most memorable, which says it all. 

Some of that could be down to the attitudes displayed by Quartermain towards Africans and women, that are plain repellent. While there’s no issue portraying characters with those flaws, it’s troubling to the modern reader when they’re on show from our hero. 

Giles Foden, writing in the Guardian, seems to agree. He notes “it has become a novel one must defend against charges of misogyny and racism” and that “there is some unspeakable stuff in King Solomon’s Mines”.

The book must be understood as being of its time, for it to be anything else would detract from the feel of authenticity Haggard brings over from his life experiences. Yet, despite this, the novel never feels cruel or spiteful, more a record of the era. Quartermain’s occasional philosophical commentary seems to apply to all men equally (if seldom woman) and never holds the behaviour of his white peers, who he has chosen to leave many miles behind, in any great esteem. 

Haggard’s writing and Quartermain’s story bounds along like a leaf caught in a flowing river, always moving along, seemingly out of control, but over time moving smoothly from start to end. He is a master at building tension as characters wait in the crisp stillness before a battle then force their way through bloody rampages to discover who made it alive.

Perhaps due to its incredibly longevity, King Solomon’s Mines feels lighter and less consequential than its reputation suggests.

Not sure if this is allowed here or not, but thought everyone here would have an interest in this.

Due to the necessary closures of businesses throughout Portland Oregon, Powell’s Books has closed it’s doors until at least April 1st.

This unfortunately also comes alongside large scale layoffs and the company is unsure when it will be able to resume normal operations.

I am posting this because I know several people whose jobs are jeopardized by this.  I am also posting it because Powell’s has been an icon for used books for decades and this potentially could be extremely impactful on their ability to continue as a company.

fkbwyy,paramssh345,Just finished Dune and what the actual frick,"Just recently got into reading (am high school junior) and it was my first book back into the wondrous world of literature. A friend recommended it to me, and I am not disappointed. What absolute perfection in world-building! I couldn’t believe myself reading the intricacies of politics and religion that a single guy just made through his own knowledge and creativity. 

The thing that stuck with me the most was the repeated reference to missionara protectiva (hopefully correct spelling), and how the whole religion of Fremen and the prophecies to the Lisan al Gaib were fabricated by the Bene Gesserit. It unveiled to me that religion, even the religion we have right now, is primarily a byproduct of holding a person or a group of people ardently in power. It’s really cool how the book subtly hinted at that and made references to how Paul himself realized he was a sort of biblical figure, with his acts knowingly spread among the Fremen and beyond.

Overall just have to say I’m amazed, shocked, and sobered. Next I’m going to read Guns, Germs, and Steel (totally different genre, I know), and use this Coronavirus panic and 3 week break from school to keep on reading.

Edmund feels their father would not approve, Tom is sure it is all innocent fun. What is the deal here? It is okay to view a play, but not to act it out at home with family for personal amusement? Was theater something for lower classes at the time?   


Also, what is the deal with all the exercise? The women, particularly Fanny, seem so frail, can't walk more than a quarter of a mile. Walking between the houses in the park is apparently exhausting enough that Edmund us upset that Fanny was asked to go back and forth twice in a day. It would seem that apparently waking and riding horses is their only form of exercise, I don't know much about riding, but strolling down a mile or so long path is certainly not a high impact sport. No halfway healthy person would be exhausted by that, even in extreme heat and humidity. Is playing frail and fragile just part of what it meant to be a proper, upper class lady?",8,1584469647,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fkaara/reading_mansfield_park_by_jane_austin_can_someone/,books,0

fk8sd6,49mercury,A specific question for those who've read Daisy Jones and the Six...,"I'm currently reading it for the first time. While I really do enjoy the ""interview style"" of writing and the story so far, there is something that is bothering me about it and I want to know if it's ever addressed later in the book:

The ages of some of the characters. 

Billy and Graham Dunne's dad left the family in 1954. Billy says he was 7 and Graham was 5. They were both born in December. So they were likely born in the years 1946 and 1948 (their dad probably left before December). It says in 1967, the brothers are in their teens when they first form a band. So, 21-year-old Billy is in his teens? 

Included in the band is Chuck Williams, the rhythm guitarist, who is described by Billy as being a few years older than the rest of the guys. Ok, fair enough. A few pages later, it says that Chuck was born on April 24, 1949. It's possible that Graham was born in that year as well, but either way he obviously wasn't ""a few years older"" than the rest of the guys. 

My question is, does this ever get addressed or are we, as readers, supposed to give the author a pass? I can understand keeping some information about the band/storyline kind of blurry just because that's how things typically work in reality when you're conducting several interviews about the same subject (with different people having different memories and different perspectives). But someone's age is fact, it's not really something that's blurry. 

I'm still really enjoying the book and look forward to reading more.",8,1584464616,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fk8sd6/a_specific_question_for_those_whove_read_daisy/,books,1

However, I think that both of them will co-exist. First-world countries will live in a world that is depicted in Brave New World and third-world countries will be in a world similar to 1984. Aren't we kind of seeing that nowadays? The developed countries are busy with increasing pleasure and convenience while developing countries continue to take away basic human rights like freedom of speech. I have lived in both types of countries and I think that seeing the reluctance and acceptance of  not being able to speak out for your rights in one country in comparison to the ignorance and indifference in the other, offers a very distinguishing juxtaposition.",21,1584463545,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fk8h1e/1984_vs_brave_new_world/,books,1

fk78ng,IFellOutOfBed,Help with King's The Stand,"Please no spoilers


I started reading *The Stand* (unabridged edition) over winter break 2018-19. It was fantastic, I loved getting into it. Unfortunately the library book went past due, I went back to college, and it remains unfinished to this day. I've been thinking about the book recently for what I'm sure are obvious reasons (I'm certainly not saying the world's situation is equivalent to the book, only the general idea). Now I have a bunch of time on my hands and want to finish it. When I started it those 15 months ago, I read the first ""book"" of the three divisions in the novel. About 450 pages. My question is: **Should I restart it from the beginning or just keep going?**

I've very torn here. I'm going to buy it on kindle but I'm such a slow reader that I don't know if I can put up with reading ~6 hours of material I've already read. But I also don't want to be hopelessly lost with the characters. The section I read is the ""plague happens, everyone dies, now the real action starts"" story set-up. I'm at the point where I remember only general details like ""okay, the musician. The fugitive. The guy from Texas. The pregnant girl from Maine. Didn't she have some boy with her?..."" etc. I don't remember fine details. I really want to finish this book but don't know how exactly to go about it.

fk1qa8,mortandsmallgods,Interests &amp; Hobbies You Gained Via Reading,"I've found that alot of my hobbies and interests are developed via reading books. So I thought I'd create a thread where we can discuss how books develop interests &amp; hobbies. 

For me, I've developed three interests:

-Russian Language, History &amp; Culture: I am learning Russian, and have an interest in Russian culture and politics. As a science fiction and fantasy fan, realising that Russia had contributed so heavily to the genre made me start an account on Duolingo. Also, Russia has produced some great writers, and the history is amazing. I would love to visit Russia in the next 2-3 years. 

-Medieval History &amp; Culture: All thanks to the fantasy genre! JK Rowling, in Harry Potter, has great references to medieval scholars and scientists. Tolkien and C.S Lewis borrow heavily from Norse sagas and Beowulf. 

What alot of people forget about medieval history is that it spans many centuries, languages and countries. There is so much detail and density to the medieval world, that a few words can't do it justice. I also have an interest in certain saints, like Aquinas and Joan of Arc. Can I see myself doing a postgraduate thesis on medieval history and reception? Oh yes. 

Ever since I started doing medieval research, I could no longer avoid the ongoing debate in the fantasy genre. Does it focus too much on medieval aesthetics and culture? I went from saying 'yes' to arguing that there is so much richness and detail in the medieval, that the fantasy genre has barly scratched its surface. (That being said, of course I support and enjoy fantasy authors who aren't interested in medieval settings!)

-Archery: This interest is not for me, but for my mother. I was reading ASOIAF and watching GOT, and my mum and I were arranging a trip to Ireland. And of course, I wanted to do a 'Game of Thrones' tour. My mother, who has no interest in ASOIAF, accepted, with no clue on what to expect. The tour was fun, but it involved archery. Turns out, I'm not like Arya Stark... but my mum is! She had a blast, and now wants to do more archery with me. That's a really positive memory I have.

So, how about you? What hobbies and interests have you gained via reading? Have they shaped your life in any way?

fjzhy4,seuil-limite,Pandemics and Literature,"So as we live through perhaps the most defining moments of our time I thought it'd be rather topical to post about books that deal with a viral pathogen of some kinds and to connect them with our current situation as a way to think through and make sense of a time that seems to lack any order. 

Whether we like it or not these times in social isolation will define us and change the way we see things. So I think a good way to work through this is through literature just to give us an idea of where to go from. 

To do this post a quote from a book that deals with a viral pathogen and how it connects to our current situation.  

So let us begin with Albert Camus' *The Plague* (*La Peste*)

It is possible to say that this marked the end of a period full of disconcerting signs and the start of another possibly more difficult time where the surprise of the first period transforms itself, little by little, into panic. (p. 34, my translation)  

(Il est possible de le dire, marqua la fin de cette période remplie de signes déconcertants et le début d’une autre, relativement plus difficile, où la surprise des premiers temps se transforma peu à peu en panique.) 

COVID-19 did not become real until I went to the grocery store before entering into social isolation. I went to liquor stores, and sure it was busier than usual but it was calm. The pet store was practically empty. In both of these cases there where full shelves and no sign of worry anywhere. Then I went to the grocery store, the same store I went to only two days prior, and it was practically empty. Maybe I should have read the diminishing garlic supplies better or maybe I should have taken everything more seriously earlier. 

What marked the end of disconcerting signs, for me, where the shelves depleted of rice, beans, pasta, canned goods. It began another, somewhat more difficult time, that is slowly transforming into panic. Sure, I have enough food for two weeks - maybe. Yet, that seems hardly the point when I keep hearing that this could go on for months. 

The first day of mandatory work from home seemed strange. It was sunny and warm. I planned on two weeks of over-hyped panic. I was to go to bars, lounge, and throw ""corona parties."" But it became real, all at once, when I saw the empty shelves and the more stringent controls my company placed on employees who had to still return to work. Those shelves carried the sufficient symbolic weight to trigger a dissimulation of kinds.  

The threat is not this unseen threat but rather the panic of others - is this not always the case though? 

The thing is? I am having a great time. I am drinking and laughing more than I have in a long while. I am eating beautiful meals with my boyfriend. I am reading and just becoming someone I thought I lost. But I have Camus in the back of my head reminding me, or perhaps telling me for the first time, that this is the start of the end. 

Little by little, this moment of opulent indulgence can transform itself into panic. Who knows? Maybe my own transformation is incomplete and maybe I will become one of those buying obscene amounts of toilet paper out of fear of what is to come next. For some it happens quick and for others slow but it hits us all in the end. We cannot simply say to the apocalypse, ""Oh no, not today."" 

The purpose of this thread is to think though our situations and to provide a space to make sense of our problems through literature. Begin with a quote from a book and work from there. Let's make sense of this madness together.",12,1584421316,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjzhy4/pandemics_and_literature/,books,1

fjycyy,MacchaExplosion,Theory: Shakespeare was a time traveler who wrote Romeo and Juliet about two star-crossed lovers who were not allowed to meet during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic.,"Obviously, he couldn't directly write about events that hadn't happened yet, for fear of posthumously being decried as a witch and burnt at the stake. So instead, he just made subtle allusions to it. He used the setting, Verona, in place of Corona. It fits:

 Example 1:  
In fair Corona, where we lay our scene,  
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny  
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean  


Example 2:  
And made Corona's ancient citizens  
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments  


Example 3:  
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath  
Forbidden bandying in Corona streets  


Example 4:  
News from Corona - How now, Balthasar!  
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?  
How doth my lady? Is my father well?  
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;  
For nothing can be ill if she is well.

fjxy6y,terribleanecdote,Evolution of Fantasy Book Covers,"Because recently I've gotten into graphic design, I've looked into a lot of book covers. Especially for fantasy, since all of my practice works tend to be for my own fantasy novels, ideas, etc. While I was digging I realized how much the focus of fantasy book covers has changed since, ex, the first few copies of Lord of the Rings. I think the most prominent example of this kind of new wave is fantasy YA, but it also goes for adult fantasy. There's a lot of photo manipulation as opposed to more classic illustrations, but there are also some beautiful works leaning into typography now! I don't know. It's just a book subject I love discussing.

fjww2l,big_st3ppa,I’m looking for two books and I remember the plot but I can’t remember the title,"One is a book where there are four friends and they live in different places and they’re connected by this show that they watch. They meet up to go to an expo of the show. the actor of the main character of the show has some sort of disease and is slowly dying, and frequently does drugs to ease his pain. The friends somehow meet the actor and go on a roadtrip with him, and the smoke pot and go to a club and try to go to a waterpark but it was abandoned (only details I remember). In the end when the actor dies it’s in his will to leave behind money for those four ppl
BOOK TWO
This one is about a guy who’s life was filmed as a popular reality tv show when he was younger, and how it affects his life now as a teenager. The only things I can remember from this book are: one episode was filmed where he takes a shit on a table and from then on everyone called him the shitter or something, he has anger issues I think, he meets his girlfriend at his job where he does something to do w food and sports, he goes to the gym often.

fjvjpq,xaviernady,I made a self-isolation/quarantine book list for a friend. What would you add?," 

*We Die Alone: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance – David Howarth*

While we sit at home with modern comforts, enjoy this story of Jan Baalsrud, the Norwegian soldier who was part of a botched operation in WWII and subsequently spent the better part of a year escaping Nazi pursuit. Jan spends time hiding out in an old cabin, buried in a snowbank, and skiing across vast mountain ranges while he tries to evade his would-be captors. Take some comfort in the fact that you get to adjust your thermostat, drink from your tap, and order delivery while you follow Jan’s epic journey. That glass of wine will taste extra sweet when you put yourself in Jan’s mind as he savors what may be the last few drops of liquor that he will taste before he’s captured, eaten by wolves, or succumbs to frostbite.

*The Stranger in the Woods: The Extraordinary Story of the Last True Hermit – Michael Finkel*

I have many issues with the author of this book and the choices he made when writing it, but there’s no denying it is an excellent story. The book follows a man who chose a life of solitude in the most extreme sense of the word. The hermit at the center of this book chose to leave society behind and quarantine himself in the woods in Maine for over two decades. His quarantine wasn’t for fear of a disease, but one he chose as a way to escape the demands of modern society. The hermit didn’t have internet or even a house, but he did read books, play handheld video games, and listen to the radio. He also scoured seasonal vacation homes in the Maine woods for provisions, much like today’s isolators are doing by hoarding supplies from Costco. We can all learn a few things from the hermit and understand what it’s like to be left alone for an extended period while we wait out whatever perils exist outside of our quarantine. We see NYT news updates and worry about being locked inside for a few weeks, why not take a few tips from a man who spent over 20 years without outside contact?

*Permanent Record – Edward Snowden*

The COVID-19 disease is not unlike the US government in that it’s reach is endless. As Edward Snowden blows the whistle on what he believes to be overreach by the CIA, he is forced into exile as the agency attempts to track him down. Living in a hotel for months and only being able to order room service, Snowden’s experience may be similar our own in the weeks to come.

*How to Be a (Bad) Birdwatcher – Simon Barnes*

For those that live in areas where restaurants and bars have already been ordered to close, our activities may be limited to going on walks outside. If you aren’t already, now would be an excellent time to start taking notice of the natural world around you. As Mr. Barnes outlines in his book, birdwatching is something that you can do in almost every part of the world. With his dry wit, Simon Barnes muses about nature in a way that is much more Great British Baking Show than it is Edward Abbey.

*The Road – Cormac McCarthy*

Toilet paper hoarding and government-mandated lockdowns make daily life right now feel like the opening scene in an apocalypse movie. So, why not read a book about what things will look like if all our doomsday scenarios come to fruition? This dark classic is also an excellent movie, but even if you have seen the movie you shouldn’t deprive yourself of Cormac McCarthy’s writing. If you haven’t seen the movie, then you get the benefit of adding the movie to your watchlist for when you are finished. This book is a story about a dad and his son as they wander a post-apocalyptic world after a mysterious catastrophic event. If you are the type of person who rushed to watch “Contagion” recently, then you will enjoy steering into the skid in the same way by imagining yourself living in the hellish landscape in which *The Road* is set.

*Ready Player One – Ernest Cline*

I have seen a few articles recently about how COVID-19 has driven more people to work from home and left many people to communicate only through screens. Whether or not this trend will continue when (or if) we come out on the other side of this pandemic, there is little doubt that our future is going to be ever more virtual. The Earnest Cline novel follows a boy as he lives out his life in a video game simulation that blurs the lines of the online world and the physical world. We may find through all this chaos, working from home isn’t that difficult. We already have Peloton classes that simulate a group fitness class. Perhaps dating from home isn’t so hard either? Before we know it, our entire lives and social interactions can be conducted from a command center in our apartment.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books

I am truly beyond speechless. With the exception of The Lord of the Rings (and its prequel the Hobbit), Gone With the Wind, famous works of classic American and British literature such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and A Tale of Two Cities, recent mega bestsellers such as The Da Vinci Code and Twilight, and many books with more famous movie adaptations such as Jaws and To Kill a Mocking Bird, less than half of the books I listed I NEVER HEARD OFF BEFORE.

And this includes at least 75% of the things originally published in English on the list. Not once have I ever knew of the existence of The Eagle Has Landed or Kane and Abel before I glanced the list.

And I am by today's standards a well-read person (esp. when you consider I am neither an intellectual nor well-educated and I actually HATE READING). I have on my Goodreads account over 100 Books in my Read List, including classics such as Gone With the Wind and the Red Badge of Courage. I even read that long doorstopper The Lord of the Rings (now my favorite book of all time &lt;3).

But to realize I don't even know most of the Bestselling works of all time in English was alreadya shock to me. Nevermind all the foreign works. It just truly shocked me beyond words that the bestselling French book of all time is a children's book called Little Prince and its not any of Dumas' classics or Victor Hugo's works or any other French novel that has gained fame to a limited extent in English circles such as Larteguay's Les Centurions. A CHILDREN'S STORY! And France is so famed and appreciated all over the world for its sophisticated classics...........

Even what left me further more speechless was the fact this French children's book is listed as the 3RD BESTSELLING BOOK OF ALL TIME after A Tale of Two Cities and The Lord of the Rings!

The only foreign-language work of literature on the list I have heard of are War and Peace and Don Quixote. All other listed foreign works to my shock are not books that are frequently stated by Americans as classic masterpieces of literature or with an even more famous American movie adaptation such as The Count of Monte Cristo or Doctor Zhivago or Les Miserables and so forth.

Is anyone here who reads more the general populace shocked as I am that we never heard of even half of the listed English-language bestsellers of all time on Wikipedia's list?

This is just Wikipedia's own list. Nevermind lists by organizations devoted to literature, by popular news magazines and newspapers such as The New York Times, or by professional scholars of literature (which have even more works I could never have hoped of discovering without further research inspired by Wikipedia).............",29,1584397851,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjtu5t/are_you_so_flabbergasted_you_never_heard_of_half/,books,1

Book Guys Show, after a 2 year hiatus is returning with a newly tuned format of evergreen episodes, re-focusing on a hour long show dedicated to bringing it's viewers/listeners great books they might like to enjoy.  We are throwing all timely content out the window and focusing on great books the listener / viewer might like to read.

If you're a book guy (guy is actually a gender neutral term, y'all!) then please contact me here or at paulthebookguy at me dot com.

Likely we will be recording on SUNDAYS via Skype.   Fair warning, we don't edit the show, it will be live streamed for one hour on youtube, and about 30 minutes after the show is live streamed, it will be available as an audio download on itunes / other podcast apps.

We are looking for a host who is a passionate lover of books. That is the only requirement.  Ideally, you already have a computer and fast internet capable of a video skype call... but experience in podcasting is not necessary.  We're willing to show you how.  What's most important is that you read frequently, have a passion for books and are willing to have an hour long conversation about books on a bi-weekly or weekly basis (on sundays).

The pay is terrible (zero) but the reward is great (we've had some great authors and celebs on before)

During our first 7 years, we tried to focus on timely book news, but that's no longer our focus.  We want our future episodes to be evergreen (aka timeless) so we are going to focus a majority of our episodes on books and why you should read those books.

We don't do negative reviews.  My philosophy is that no human being could possibly read all the books in existence, so we will not be wasting our time telling listeners/viewers why they shouldn't read a particular book, instead we will focus on which books viewers/listeners SHOULD read.

fjt7nm,lukejmcgrath,The Yellow M,"The Yellow M is the sixth volume, but third story in the long-running Blake and Mortimer series. Following on from two longer stories, published over three and then two volumes, The Yellow M is often confusingly found as book number one due to its reprint by Cinebook. 

All that number fun aside, The Yellow M is easily the most famous of the Blake and Mortimer series, not least for its iconic cover art, which perfectly encapsulates the shadowy brightness of the book like a pop-noir poster. It makes sense Cinebook present this as the first story as it’s an excellent introduction to the characters, themes and mood of the Blake and Mortimer universe.

First published in the weekly Tintin magazine, between 1953 and 1954, The Yellow M built on the success of both The Secret of the Swordfish and The Mystery of the Great Pyramid. Much like the closely linked Adventures of Tintin, previous escapades are mentioned but not relied on for understanding. 

Blake and Mortimer, our leads, are a MI5 former Army Captain and a Professor respectively. While grounded in noir detective realism, their stories also include science fiction concepts drawn from the 1950s. They’re a double-act owing a fair amount to Holmes and Watson, though combining aspects of both alongside a more energetic style.

The story begins with news of an ongoing criminal, who commits daring crimes and leaves his mark (the titular Yellow M) all over London. Blake and Mortimer take on the case, vowing to discover the identity and motives of the mysterious man. 

The Yellow M begins to kidnap group of men one-by-one, with Blake guarding the remaining member of the group and Mortimer searching for a connection between them. Just too late, the final man disappears, and Mortimer finds evidence of a mind-control experiment from years before that lead to the death of one and disappearance of another.

Blake and Mortimer must track down the Yellow M before he can enact his revenge plan.

Even as a long-time Tintin fan (see my review of The Blue Lotus), I wasn’t aware of Blake and Mortimer until I compiled my list of books to read and review. I’ve said before, I’m pleased I included Le Monde in my list as it’s opened up books outside of the English-speaking world more than any other.

While the design is unmistakably from the same publisher, where stories would need to conform to the weekly magazine format, the tone sets it well apart from Tintin’s simpler and lighter approach. The Yellow M is a smart detective adventure story, with action, science fiction and wonderfully illustrated panels.

What a shame that while I quickly read through every Tintin adventure, I never knew about their close cousin lurking in the shadows not too far away. I’m looking forward not only to reading more Blake and Mortimer, but also sharing them with my children as they grow up.

As I find from time-to-time, especially with the Le Monde books, there’s not a wealth of opinion online about either The Yellow M or Blake and Mortimer more generally. The Wikipedia page is slim and most search results are from book stores or recaps of the plot.

The one critical theme I noticed across some reader reviews is the wordiness of the book, something I’d agree with, but I don’t believe is to its detriment. Compared to say Tintin (a lazy but sensible proxy), the panels are dense with speech and thought but I don’t find this off-putting when reading. With the story originally being published weekly, there is a tendency to recap which feels odd when presented in a single volume

I recommend reading The Yellow M if you’re a fan on Tintin, comics or graphic novels. It’s beautifully illustrated and well written too. The characters are engaging and the the story keeps its energy and mystery throughout, whilst creating a time capsule version of 1950s London.",0,1584395610,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjt7nm/the_yellow_m/,books,1
fjt6dp,crashkg,This whole Corona Virus saga reminds me of The Golgafrinchans from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.,"We are probably all going to die after being infected from dirty cell phones. 

The Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B was a way of removing the basically useless citizens from the planet of Golgafrincham. A variety of stories were formed about the doom of the planet, such as blowing up, crashing into the sun or being eaten by a mutant star goat. The ship was filled with all the middlemen of Golgafrincham, such as the telephone sanitizers, account executives, hairdressers, tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers, security guards, public relations executives, and management consultants.

Ark Fleet ships A and C  were supposed to carry the people who ruled, thought, or actually did useful work.

The ship was programmed to crash onto its designated planet, Earth. The captain remembers that he was told a good reason for this, but had forgotten it, although the reason was later revealed to be because the Ark Ship B Golgafrinchans were a 'bunch of useless idiots'.

Flight to Earth
After the ship took off, no word was heard from either Golgafrincham or the other A and C ships.

After five years of traveling, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect were teleported onto the ship. They spoke to the captain and were very alarmed by the story of the ship.

On Earth
The ship crashes onto the supercomputer Earth and is wrecked, but many of the passengers and crew survive.  They begin running the planet in accordance with their previous useless ways.  Arthur and Ford agree that this explains a lot about later Earth inhabitants.  

Fate of Golgafrincham
A notation in the Guide about Golgafrincham after the departure of the B Ark states that the entire remaining population subsequently died from a virulent disease contracted from a dirty telephone.",1,1584395478,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjt6dp/this_whole_corona_virus_saga_reminds_me_of_the/,books,0

fjsztd,lukejmcgrath,The Sign of Four,"Once again, it’s time to delve into my complete Sherlock Holmes collection for another mystery with the world’s most famous detective. This time, it’s The Sign of Four, sometimes called The Sign of the Four but who really cares, there are four people and they make a sign.

Unlike the more celebrated Holmes novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Hound of the Baskervilles, I’ve never been fond of The Sign of Four. Where Scarlet has the nostalgic pull of being our introduction to the detective and his sidekick, and Hound is a genuine masterpiece, Sign leaves me unmoved. 

For me, Hound aside, Conan-Doyle excels in the short stories and longer works can drag. Both here and in Scarlet he adds to the length of the tale with a second story recounting the events leading up to the crime. It’s a shame, as the present-day part of this story is excellent, with Holmes now almost fully-formed as a crack-addicted genius and Watson as his reliable friend. Indeed, it’s here we find one of Holmes most famous lessons: 

“How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”
There’s a reasonably interesting, if well documented, backstory to the publication of The Sign of Four. The story goes that Conan-Doyle and Oscar Wilde both attended a meeting with the magazine owner Joseph Stoddart, who wanted to launch his Lippincott’s magazine in England. Both writers took to their tasks, with the results being The Sign of Four and The Picture of Dorian Gray. Quite the result for the enterprising American publisher.

The story itself begins with the arrival of Mary Morstan at 221B Baker Street, a quiet lady who has been receiving a gift of a valuable pearl once a year and who’s unknown benefactor now wishes to meet. Along with Holmes and Watson, we’re compelled into a complex narrative of hidden treasure, murder and intrigue. As the clues unravel, Holmes chases down his suspect across London and onto the fastest boats on the Thames for a final high-speed, all-stakes river chase. 

Split into two parts, The Sign of Four works much better in pieces than its whole. Despite a well-paced mystery and excellent use of Holmes in the first section, I’m never invested enough to be interested in the villain’s exotic backstory. My preference remains for the more everyday Holmes story, rather than the grand.

It’s also troubling racist in parts, including refences to cannibals and a characterisation of India as either savage (bad) or deferential (good). 

Most of all, I never believe Watson’s love story with Mary. Perhaps of its time and coloured by his dual role as character and narrator, the romance feels one-sided and forced until it is suddenly resolved. Mary has since found more character in the BBC Sherlock series, here she could easily be wish-fulfilment for a lonely sidekick and storyteller.

In researching this review, I found the internet now filled with GCSE guides to the novel, potentially further condemning it to lesser status as students steer clear of it beyond exam season. Interestingly, despite featuring as one of his 100 best novels, Robert McCrum doesn’t say a great deal in his own review, though does praise the characterisation and “compelling” story.

There are more than enough moments for Holmes fans to savour in The Sign of Four, despite its overlong format. Conan-Doyle lays groundwork for many successful adventures by developing Holmes into his now familiar self-destructive and more-human-than-you-remember character, one who feels only emptiness to endure when a story is resolved:

“For me,” said Sherlock Holmes, “there still remains the cocaine-bottle.” And he stretched his long white hand up for it.”",2,1584394830,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjsztd/the_sign_of_four/,books,2

Another book I am looking for is,  English translation of  Itch of Wisdom by Mikhail Turovskiĭ...Anyone  know about these books?

These  books are consisting of some witty and wise aphorism, like the maxims of   François de La Rochefoucauld  or  Null und Eins: Aphorisms of Hans  Abendroth, you can read some of his aphorisms in [the paris review](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/03/14/null-und-eins-aphorisms/)..

I  like aphorisms because they are short, witty and powerful.  A line or  two can give you important insight about life or reality.

Two aphorisms from Unkempt thoughts:

**Do not ask God the way to heaven; he will show you the hardest one.**

**Is it progress if a cannibal uses knife and fork?**

And two from Itch of Wisdom,

**Broken wings fit more easily in standard-size boxes.**

fjqy6k,sleeplesseemore,"Medieval settings, fantasy vs historically accurate","I'm a huge D&amp;D fan, so personally I LOVE consuming any work with a medieval fantasy setting, regardless of genre, movies, books, games, etc. Stuff like Eragon, LOTR, Witcher, Long Live the Queen, they all have a place in my heart. Unfortunately, as much as I love it, sometimes the level of worldbuilding the authors put in can be staggering and actually intimidates me from wanting to read their works if I feel too busy at the time.

On the flip side, I find that books set in a historically-accurate medieval era are so hard to find (outside of the romance genre). Sometimes I enjoy them if they're immersive and really allow an exploration of the setting, but sometimes they can feel very pedantic and constrained. I guess due to the limitations of the era?

Is there just a smaller demand for books set in a non-fantasy medieval time? What do y'all prefer to read between the two of them?

I've recently got back into reading and since I'm taking English Literature for my A-Levels I decided it would be a good idea to read through some of the classics.

Which of the classics would I, at 16 be able to understand and appreciate fully?

For reference I've just read 1984 and was able to understand the story without any issues and also got most of the subtle themes and points featured in the novel. I'm unlikely to be able to read anything that has syntax much more complicated than 1984.

First of all, here's the traditional: sorry for any bad English, I'm a non native. Hope I'm understandable despite the mistakes.

So. When I was a kid, books made me go through the whole array of emotions - they made me laugh, cry, cower in my bed whenever a dark shadow caught my eye. I've never really stopped reading but as time passed those emotions... dulled. Now it's not that books don't interest me anymore, but they don't evoke any sort of emotional response anymore. I miss it, truth be told. Books don't... ""stay with me"" anymore, I just read them then forget them.

Did that kind of thing ever happen to you? Did you manage to get back into emotionally investing yourself in a story? If so, how did you do it?

fjkklx,Rudle455,No talk about Earth Abides during the current situation?,"There's various mentions of The Stand by Stephen King but I feel a more appropriate book is Earth Abides.
It deals with the immediate aftermath of a super plague and how society starts to reform.

The start it's prefaced with the quote:
""If a killing type of virus strain should suddenly arise by mutation...it could, because of the rapid transportation in which we indulge nowadays, be carried to the far corners of the earth and cause the deaths of millions of people."" W. M. Stanley, in Chemical and Engineering News, December 22, 1947.
I find the observations very interesting such as the majority of sheep getting wiped out as there are no Shepard's to look after them and they've lost the ability to fend for themselves etc.

I also love that the book spans a 60 year odd time frame so you get a sense of evolution down the line and the story isn't cut off.",3,1584363623,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjkklx/no_talk_about_earth_abides_during_the_current/,books,1

fjjdht,Razik_,I AM THINKING OF ENDING THINGS by Iain Reid really got me thinking...,"This book without a doubt is one if the more interesting books I've read. In the beginning I was expecting a plot because I came into the book with a preconceived notion of it being horror. But upon reading it, I found it belongs more in psychological/philosophical subgenre. 

There are many things to unpack from this book. From the beginning of the book where so much of it is a mystery to the reader that they can't help but flip through the pages to the climax of the book where something fascinating is revealed about the characters. I will say that I had to read the end twice  because sadly I was part of the population of people that didn't understand what happened thus bought disappointment.

I would like to know what you thought of this thought-provoking novel and what you make of that shocking/anticlimatic end. 

And for those who haven't read it I recommend this one. Its not for everyone but it does serve as a unique reading experience.

It is about the hardships of an Irish family migrating to the U. S. after the great depression. McCourt is full of amazing anecdotes. Here is an example: He writes about a teacher who peals an apple before every class. He then lets the peal sit on his desk to give it as a reward for good performance. That anecdote still lingers with me to this day. Times have just changed so much.

fjgoe8,Fernxtwo,Attempting to read the top 100 best selling books in 2 years.," 

Hello, 

I've challenged myself to read the top 100 best selling books of all time. I'm gong to write a blog about the whole experience; the highs, the lows , the stand out books, the must reads and all the rest. 

Right now i'm starting but i'm reading them on my 5 inch phone, or printing them in print shops or using my laptop. This is proving a bit difficult; phone notifications can be distracting and the option to just browser Reddit or play some games is also breaking my focus.

So what i'm looking for is a small donation so i can buy an e-book reader for this project. I spent 5 hours collecting the ebooks and have about 96 out of the 100 books. I will find the others or might have to buy hard copies.

[I did a similar project about 8 or 9 years ago where i watched the top 250 movies in reverse order. That took 1 year to complete, so i thing 2 years for 100 books seems realistic](https://top250imdbfilms.wordpress.com/).   
A book a week.

### What you come in

So to get an e-book reader i think ill need about $100 , and i'm just looking to see if anyone would like to donate to this project. Just a dollar or something. Or better still if someone has an old reader that would be excellent!

### Upon completion

I just want the e-book for this project and have no problem giving the eBook to a charity or someone else who wants to try this project after I've read them all. Thank for taking the time to read this post, cheers.

fjg9gl,Sansophia,The Great Gadby: Did I miss something important?,"I just watched this video on Nick Calloway as the author of the Great Gatsby
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlNOIuXj3hk

And I'm not sure I'm WRONG, but maybe I am.

See...I don't hate any of the characters of the Great Gatsby, with Tom coming very close. I don't see them as evil, only awfully self-absorbed. What keeps me from hating them is there is NO voice of self-awareness, or moral conscience or empathy to give them any kind of direction. They are innocent in a sense, vicious, narcissistic, lashing out, but they don't seem to really know better. It's one thing to be TOLD what is right and wrong but without being taught self-reflection or even keeping an eye out for consequences, they've never been able to really grapple with morality in a real way.

All of our criticisms of these characters are things someone NEEDS to tell them and tell them gently. They are expected to be decent human beings but they aren't taught how. None of them seem contemptuous of morality or empathy, they just don't notice it's there. 

If there's anything I've learned in my life, and I was in my mid 30s when I read this book and thus older than almost all the characters, it's that empathy IS innate but it needs to be taught and reinforced and there's a certain self-criticism that Americans are not taught.

And to make a long story short, I always thought that it was clear from the last few pages, that Nick is basically saying ""I had my moral foundations shaken, I truly challenged morally by the cruelty and wilfulness of these people of the egg. Gatsby was a kindred spirit, someone who wants to be honest, to be decent and gets caught up in the glamour. I failed him as a friend and now I got the fuck out of the eggs because it's a poisonous place. I'm home now where people are decent. I need to become a better person because I was found lacking there, but I have no idea how.""

So I saw the Great Gatsby as Nick having a brush with death and damnation via Gatsby as a proxy. The book ends hopefully because he's disgusted by all the material excess because it satisfied no one and made them ugly and unpleasant. Nick Calloway is putting his thoughts in order because he is, with great stumbling and no guide, about to embark on a journey to become a better person, because he can't bear the thought of ending up like them. 

And given all I've read of old-timey literature it seems, SEEMS that people in the past cannot imagine they themselves could ever be the bad guys. That they could stumble into villainy due to carelessness. It's only when you get into the 40s and 50s when people have to wrestle with the horrors of Communism and Nazism and how they are a little too close to either to put the pang in people's minds. You need something like High Noon to show people you can be the villain through ungratefulness, preserving self-interest, and conventional sensibilities. And for Nick Calloway, High Noon is 30 years away.

fjdfwf,BMaack,Discussion: Supporting Your Local Library vs Supporting Your Local Bookstore,"Got into an interesting discussion with my SO this afternoon. Philosophically speaking, which of the two is more important? Perhaps the answer isn't so binary.

In one corner, weighing in at approximately 116k (in the U.S. of A), you have libraries. Freedom. Haven. Center. How could one possibly argue against the importance of the library? Access to free knowledge/entertainment simply cannot be contested. The amount of knowledge a library contains presents a reading challenge too great for a single individual. Being funded by cities/counties/states certainly helps with sustainability as well. Libraries also exist as safe havens from the noise of the world. Finally, no one ever needs to sell/donate their owned books if they only ever use the library. Say goodbye to clutter!

In the other corner, weighing in at approximately 10k (in the U.S. of A), you have bookstores. Mercantilism. Consumerism. Community. To be able to support your favorite artists and the stores that house/represent them. Television and video games and social media provide newer forms of entertainment that trigger dopamine at faster rates. Amazon rapidly chips away at the very market it was founded upon. The odds are stacked against local bookstores everywhere. But what does it mean to own a book rather than rent it and return it? On the one hand, it's typical consumerism where we have a need that must be filled with a purchase. On the other hand, we become individual libraries, capable of sharing and spreading books amongst friends and family. 

This is a very stream of consciousness post, but with the current pandemic spreading, and more people staying inside than ever before, I worry for bookstores and libraries alike that might lose business/funding.",18,1584325512,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fjdfwf/discussion_supporting_your_local_library_vs/,books,1

Online format? (goodreads seems to have this function for private groups, but anything other/better out there I should look into for a mini message board or email thread type format which is minimally painful to access but provides opportunity for discussion?)

Anybody ever do audio/visual meetups to discuss at intervals (maybe 1/2 the book or whole book to sum things up?)

After their takeover soldiers forced the entire capital city to evacuate on foot and condemned them to hard labor in what has been referred to as the “killing fields.”

”Stay Alive, My Son” by Pin Yathay documents one man’s struggle for the survival of himself and his entire family. I was compelled by Yathay’s honesty, as well as his empathic descriptions of his family members around him.

By the end of the book Yathay is the only known surviving member of his immediate family, with the possible exception of Nawath, his six year old son who he was forced to abandon.

I know there would be problems / downsides. For one, when students are given books, some will probably vandalise them. It's also inevitable that some students would go on their phones in this time. These are, however, to be expected in every lesson and not exclusive to this one.

fj88c6,KnoelLedge,James Joyce: does it get better?,"I read through the rules and guidelines so hopefully I'm not breaking any rules when posting this. This might be all over the place but hopefully I hone it down toward the end. 

I'm currently reading Joyce's *A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man*,  (almost done) and found myself really enthralled by his writing. I often lean toward dead authors rather than contemporary literature (I call them ""dead authors"" because I don't think ""classical"" literature really captures the scope of it all. Basically I enjoy things from dead people, not *because* they're dead but because it's from a time period long ago. I hope that makes sense and doesn't make me look weird.) However, I find that when reading older novels, it's a bit difficult to get in the groove of things due to the different language used, and that's a problem I face often. That's why I was so happy and glad that I really got into Joyce's prose because he's from a different time period but that didn't stop me from really getting into it. 

However, despite all of that, I really didn't care about the *subject* if that makes sense. I feel like nothing really .... um, *happens* in this novel. There is so much happening around Stephen's life (his family slow financial decline, Ireland's political environment, etc) yet Joyce doesn't really focuses on that. He mentions it but Stephen's rather impartial toward all of this throughout the novel. Even in the moments he gets very involved in whatever subject, he soon loses all interest in it and moves onto the next subject.  For example, when he went to that retreat and felt awful about his ""sins"" and confesses to the priest and vows to a live a better, holy life. Yet in the next chapter when he's offered a position in the church, he just kind of shrugs it away. 

It's considered a coming of age story and I can definitely agree with that. I did enjoy seeing Stephen grow up, from such an innocent and adorable little kid to a smart, if not cocky sometimes, university student. I liked how Stephen tackled intellectual conversations, with wit and humour. 

I think what I'm (finally) trying to say is that this novel mostly offers glimpses into Stephen's transition  from childhood into young adulthood. And I enjoyed that, I really did, despite the lack of ... I don't' even know what word to use. Compared to stories like Harry Potter or Narnia or even Catcher in the Rye (other popular coming of age stories), I don't think there was any big impactful moment that really changed Stephen and/or pushed him/forced him into adulthood. There was no big ""goal"" here (versus Harry's goal which was to defeat voldemort, using a very simple example). And that's what I feel lacked in the novel.  (please let me know if you agree/disagree and why!) 

Despite all of that, and this is really more of a side note, I really did enjoy my first exposure to James Joyce and was wondering whether all his work is similar to this one or not. I would love to read his other novels, but I really don't know where to start.",12,1584305181,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fj88c6/james_joyce_does_it_get_better/,books,1

fj6kyj,_shme,Books similar to witcher ?,"I really liked the dark tone and look on the world in the witcher books of andrzej sapkowski . Almost everything felt so pessimistic and by that so real. I already read the first game of thrones book but it seemed a little too over the top ( it is a great book series either way ). I felt that andrzej sapkowski could really get a glimpse of reallity with being not too dark but not having a cheesy happily ever after like tolkien did it in lord of the Rings.

The character and world building were especially what i liked in his books. I dont have to mention how awesome the fates of the main characters were and even side characters like the boy of the temple of melitele who went to fight in the wars against nilfgaard. Through the book series but especially in the last book you could saw that andrzeij sapkowski really thought everything out and ended it when it was at its best, not ""stretching"" and letting it slowly die out and become boring ( looking at you game of thones). 

Also i think andrzeij sapkowski is really good at building up tention in his stories. For example the short story were duny was in. The tention that build itself slowly but not too slowly up to the Fight and the showing of pavettas magic. Everything up to the Fight and even after felt like a f****** tarantino movie. And that was just the beginning of the books.

I dont know what it is that makes the witcher books so great. It is really easy to read but it is so philosophical and it makes you think about the topics it talks about. It definetly doesnt ""re-invent the wheel"" but everything it does does it great and it is a book series with almost no flaws.

fj60gf,AnAverageFreak,How to get back to reading after literature lessons?,"As a kid I loved reading. I would take a book, and be gone for a day. I mostly loved fantasy, but also appreciated good books of other genres, mostly those targeted towards audience of my age.

fj3f9k,ashisreallytired,I read The Chalk Man by CJ Tudor,"I'm a horror nerd. I like everything that's weird and spooky, especially if it's thriller. I heard some really good reviews about The Chalk Man and was ready to support some female horror writers (and CJ was born in the same town as I was, so I was a little biased). Unfortunately, upon reading it I was a little disappointed... 

The writing is reasonably good and the characters and plot twists were great throughout. The thing is, fear comes from the unknown. That's why horror and mystery/thriller can work so well together, but sometimes it's hard to create a good reveal. I think that's part of what happened, there were just a few too many plot twists that lead to an anticlimactic conclusion I guess. I also think we would have benefitted from knowing what comes in the epilogue from the beginning. All that being said, I think I might still read The Taking of Annie Thorne.

fj2uz7,strychnine-hamburger,The role of computers in Thomas Ligotti’s &lt;My Work Is Not Yet Done&gt;?,"As much as I enjoy Weird fiction(preferably with horror elements;they almost always do), sometimes the genre get’s a bit too cryptic for satisfaction. That Is what makes it weird fiction, but with every story like Ligotti’s &lt;Purity&gt;, which is definately very strange and also has a certain sense of resolution at the end, there’s also others like &lt;Les Fleurs&gt;, which, really doesn’t offer much explanation or resolution for the reader to gain satisfaction.

&lt;My Work Is Not Yet Done&gt; is, thankfully, an exception to this in the most part. The story is straight forward(but with no less strangeness than it’s genre predecessors), and absolutely has resolutions which the reader, although not completely emphathize with, can understand as how it happened(both physically and in the mind of the protagonist). 

There is one thing I don’t get in the book, however, and that is the reapetedly mentioned protagonist’s distaste for computers. They are pointed out as trivial details(with visceral reaction from the protagonist), and at one point the word itself is blanked out, as if Ligotti himself couldn’t stand to use the word anymore.

Is there any particular meaning the computer symbolizes in this context?",1,1584285604,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fj2uz7/the_role_of_computers_in_thomas_ligottis_my_work/,books,1

fj2o3l,ConstantReader94,The Bloom 4,"Most people with even a passing interest in literary fiction, in particular American literary fiction, are aware of the four authors that critic Harold Bloom named as the major American novelists ""who are still at work and who deserve our praise."" These four being Philip Roth, Don Delillo, Thomas Pynchon and Cormac McCarthy. He made this declaration in 2003, and since then Philip Roth retired after the publication of Nemesis in 2010. He passed away in 2018. Cormac McCarthy has not had a novel published since The Road in 2006 and Pynchon since Bleeding Edge in 2013. The last Don Delillo novel was a little more recent, Zero K released in 2016. 

My own opinion on these four novelists varies. I think two are brilliant, one has a very patchy track record with a few hits but many misses, and the writing of the other one drives me insane. My opinion aside, the three survivors are now in their 80s and while I hear Don Delillo is working on a new book, it's hard to judge whether or not the other two can be considered actively working in 2020. 

Harold Bloom passed away last year. His criticism was decisive, but agree or disagree, these four writers have come to stand as something of a Mount Rushmore of American fiction.

I would point to Anton Chigurgh in *No Country For Old Men* and Harvey Dent in *The Dark Knight* as examples of this archetype. One believes himself to be the pawn of some inevitable and ineffable kind of fate, and the other uses chance to decide whether or not people live or die. Dr. Manhattan in Watchman (at least earlier in the book) might be a less psychotic example of a similar philosophy.

Dr. Kelly Connolly is part of a top-secret team studying the most important find in human history, the Enigma Cube, an alien artifact of incomprehensible power. A cube whose technology can catapult civilization to dizzying heights--or destroy it entirely.

After years of failed attempts to unlock the cube's secrets, all hell suddenly breaks loose. Kelly and a black-ops commando, Justin Boyd, are soon fighting against all odds to stay alive, and to keep the cube out of enemy hands.

As the situation quickly goes from bad to worse, Kelly discovers that the cube's capabilities are far greater than even she had imagined.

I don't get the logic here, since it doesn't change anything else than the price, at least that is what it looks like to me.

**The Tipping Point, by Malcolm Gladwell**

I like this book, but I'm torn. It's very engaging and I find myself turning pages like a madman. However, I'm not sure. I get the feeling - especially during the final pages of the book, where I'm at right now - that Gladwell (while a great writer) does popular science-ify his writing a little bit too much. I would describe the flow of the book like this:

* Interesting introduction to the topic of tipping points
* Introducing the concepts of connectors and other personality types
* Bringing up very diverse examples of interesting stuff that is related to, but also seem distant to, the topic of the book
* Trying to tie everything together at the end and declare ""This is the theory of tipping points""
* Failing to convince me, probably because I don't buy the ""here's a theory"" due to lack of... scientific method?

I don't know. Again, the book is intriguing and I read the whole thing in a short period of time. Will probably rate it a 4 out of 5. But it seems like it's travelling very far out on the

&gt;science --- popular science

scale, while still presenting itself as solid science (not an explicit claim, more of my gut feeling).

fiynvn,Ion_12,A few questions about American Psycho.,"I’m currently on my second read-through of the book, but I’m still a bit confused on a few things.

Does Sean know that Patrick is a psychopath? Or a killer? 

What did Patrick’s father do for a living, during his lunch with Bethany, he is upset at the mention of his father, and his business. This may have been talked about in other Ellis books, but I haven’t read them.

Speaking of Bethany, she knows about Patrick’s mental illness and violence right? She picks up on every little insecurity he shows, and he mentioned something that hints at the reason she left him, was because he beat her. 

What the hell happened to Price? What was the cause of his mental breakdown? I know he is in another Ellis book, but again, I have yet to read them.",2,1584263518,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fiynvn/a_few_questions_about_american_psycho/,books,1

fiutu2,mortandsmallgods,"Giving ""American Psycho"" Another Chance","So, a few years ago I read American Psycho and I absolutely hated it. It wasn't the tough subject matter, or graphic violence (although that may have put me off at times). It's the vanity, the shallowness, the brand names (from universities like Harvard to designers such as Versace). I remember reading the book, and having such a strong emotional reaction that I threw it onto the ground. Melodramatic, I know! 

But years have passed, and my reading tastes have widened. And looking back, it makes little sense for me to react so strongly towards American Psycho. So I'm going to reread it in a few months time. I think my inital problem was reading American Psycho like I read Chuck Palahniuk. Really- I should've read AP like ""Naked Lunch."" 

So has anyone else given American Psycho another chance? And for those who initally loved the book, any tips or perspectives on a second reading? Any thoughts on AP are welcome- positive, neutral or negative.

I was engaged quite a lot the first time I read it, but I remember being underwhelmed quite a bit with the ending. I won't spoil the last lines, as often quite as they are, but I must say looking back on them now it just hits differently.

I always thought that the little town of Oran worked beautifully as it's own self contained entity, yet had a very universal familiarity to it. Reading about the COVID ravaging the world currently brings back some of the familiar ache I felt reading it... Especially when I imagine the thousands of Dr. Rieux' out there, working away tirelessly, singular focused on their mission, (to a fault, like in the book)...the amount of religious sermons like Father Panteloux's dramatic yet flawed sermon, the thousands of Ramberts, separated from their significant other, and even when it's all over, Cottard and his inability to cope.

fismv1,CremeCrimson,Junji Ito is this generation's Lovecraft,"Junji Ito is a Japanese manga writer/illustrator who turns everyday mundane things into something horrible. His work and art-style has a way of infiltrating the subconscious. 

Having read several of Lovecraft's stories, I have to say they're dated; Dagon, Cthulhu, Jake from Statefarm, they're not really not so much 'horrifying' but rather discomfort readers, and were probably an outlet for Lovecraft's xenophobia. 

His story Uzumaki, which I am currently reading, takes the idea of the 'spiral' and twists it (haha) into this pervasive force that is plaguing the town, killing, deforming, and causing havoc to residents.

fis0yt,DorneForPresident,The Disposessed by Ursula Le Guin,"I am in awe of this novel. It has truly hit me at a deep level. I have always been a bit idealist and I’m a huge fan of dystopian/utopian novels. One of my all time favorite books has always been Island by Aldous Huxley, I completely bought into his utopia. The Dispossessed, however, turns the idea of a utopia and dystopia up on its head. There will never be a perfect society and we need to realize that we with everything we gain, we lose something too. 

Would you rather be born at random on a world with no war, no poverty or famine, equality among the sexes, no rules or government, but with very little natural resources and a economic system that requires a lot of hard labor....

Or,

on a world with innumerable riches and natural resources for wealth but with all the downfalls of traditional Earth style societies, castes, sexism, war, poverty and all the rest where only a few enjoy the riches while the masses are reduced to complete poverty and slavery. 

Every freedom comes at a cost, that is what I believe Le Guin is saying with this novel. I almost can’t wait to read it again in a year or so and see how much more I can get from it a second time around.",4,1584229718,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fis0yt/the_disposessed_by_ursula_le_guin/,books,1

fir82i,datedusername,The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein is Hyper-Relevant for a COVID-19 Dominated Earth,"I don't know how popular this book is, but it's very polarizing, as it attacks the heart of neoliberalism/corporatism as envisaged by Milton Friedman and the ""Chicago School"" economic principles that were adopted by many governments across the Earth from the 70s to today.

The book examines the principle of electroshock therapy as it was developed in relation to psychology and brainwashing (of particular interest to the CIA in project MKUltra). This same ""shock treatment"" was how Friedman felt his corporatist economic vision could best be enacted. In extreme brief, Friedman wanted absolute minimum government, basically nothing beyond military/defense, and felt the free market would self-regulate everything from prices, wages, supply, demand. Any failing of an economy was due to ""distortions"" as some form of unnecessary intervention. Shock on a national level, say by a coup de etat, would allow for a society to rebuild according to his ""pure"" capitalist vision. This was applied in Chile with Pinochet, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, etc.

The same principles were applied after disasters like the 2004 Tsunami, or Hurricane Katrina. The shock of Katrina allowed George Bush to push a neoliberal darling policy (charter schools) through. The New Orleans Public School system was essentially gutted and replaced with a voucher program to charter schools. 

It was pure coincidence that I picked this book up last week, but it's quite prophetic. I was prompted to post this thread after reading about the couple in Vancouver that bought tens of thousands of bottles of lysol and are trying to resell them. The quote from the hoarder was about fixing the ""inefficiencies of the market"". This is verbatim Friedman/Chicago school language. Other concepts discussed this week have included ""helicopter money"", a Friedman proposal to basically give away money. 

What's the big picture though? Pay attention to what has happened and what is being discussed. The fed approved $1.5 trillion to basically bail out shareholders overnight. Think about the last time any proposal even a tenth this costly was ever moved on so quickly. The shock of COVID allowed this corporatist policy to slip through. Another policy discussed was cutting payroll taxes as a ""stimulus"". While you could debate the merits of this proposal, Trump has explicitly wanted to cut payroll taxes to zero, permanently. COVID is the shock that puts society into a state of malleability, and policies with generational consequences will slip through. The flip side of this, politically speaking, would be pushing for medicare for all, paid sick leave, free testing and treatment, etc.

Anyway, politics aside, this book was practically written for the COVID-19 Pandemic. If you can stand to read political books from a progressive point of view, this is a must read.",31,1584226463,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fir82i/the_shock_doctrine_by_naomi_klein_is/,books,1

fiqknb,Keaton126,My Thoughts on The Devil In The White City by Erik Larson,"\- So I did a thing. I read The Devil In The White City, and found it to be excellent, as everyone who had recommended the book to me (and there were many), had said. I really loved how so many events occurring before, or during, the Chicago's World Fair Exposition, connected to much big occurrences in early 20th century American history. And this is a conundrum for me, because I would like to discuss some of these happenings, but I feel a great strength of this book is in the reveals, and I would hate to spoil that for those who haven't read it. So, I will attempt to talk about the more general elements of the book I had opinions on.

\- I am surprised, and somewhat saddened, Daniel Burnham is not a more celebrated icon in American History. I confess, rather ashamed, this was the first instance I had read about the supreme architect. Being a salty New Yorker, I read with a smirk on all the obstacles and ridiculousness this man, his artistic partner John Root, and his team, had to endure to erect this phenomenon of manufacturing. And, by the end, I was rooting for a man who had accomplished the impossible. Unbelievable feat that he was able to erect most of the fair in the extremely short window he was given. 

\- I felt Frederick Olmstead was a tragic figure, and was frustrated alongside him at every decision. Mayor Harrison Carter seemed a fantastic man who led one of those unique lives. As did, obviously, Buffalo Bill Cody. His moment with the brave Susan B. Anthony is iconic. There are many figures of history that appear in this snapshot of 1893, and I would encourage anyone to see for themselves what happens to them.

\- Dr. H.H. Holmes. What an incredible fiend and bastard. And, yet, apparently he held extreme powers of pursuasion and possession of the men and women of Chicago, and elsewhere. One of America's most prolific serial killers, Holmes existed in that perfect age, and place, where missing persons were not investigated as fervently as today. The extreme ignorance of his neighbors, his residents, and the Chicago PD was appalling. Larson delved into the gruesome details of his deeds- it is astonishing, sickening, and I absolutely could not put the book down. Bone-chilling, and worth the read for that alone. Christ, this world has harbored some evil men. What is wrong with us?

\- The city of Chicago itself seemed a city transformed. On a side note, I began reading this book during the now suspended NBA season's last All Star game, and there pre-game tribute to Chicago kind of helped set up a flavor for the city. Cool story, right? Industrial-era Chicago was black--black buildings smeared with the stains of industry, black streets caked with macadam and tar, black air filled with smoke and smog. Black deeds made ambitious, young American women vanish. A slaughterhouse of hogs and haunts, Chicago was the dirty younger brother to preeminent New York. The fair changed all of that, as Larson's extensive work shows, and changed the way we see architecture even today. I truly caught a tangible glimpse of the city, its origins, and its culture, and see why it remains a wonder. It became ""The White City"", and was mourned as a revered martyr for arts, beauty, and leisure when it shut down in October 1893. It was looked upon as a transformative, almost spiritual event by those who attended, either common or grandstanding. It's one of those moments in time, I wish I could access through a sort of time machine or otherwise. Magic and Mayhem reigned.

&amp;#x200B;

“I was born with the devil in me,' Holmes wrote. 'I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than the poet can help the inspiration to sing.”

&amp;#x200B;

“No one could bear the idea of the White City lying empty and desolate."" A Cosmopolitan writer said, ""Better to have it vanish suddenly, in a blaze of glory, than fall into gradual disrepair and dilapidation. There is no more melancholy spectacle than a festal hall, the morning after the banquet, when the guests have departed and the lights are extinguished.”",2,1584223900,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fiqknb/my_thoughts_on_the_devil_in_the_white_city_by/,books,1

Who had time to read when there was so much to do around the house? I recounted probably my worst childhood memory: when my mom took all of my books to the dumpster. One of the books was, at the time, my most prized possession. It was an extremely rare book that my favorite English teacher had given me the day that she told us she was moving to another school.

I was encouraged to let go of my remorse and the guilt I associated with reading and I was determined to rekindle my love for my favorite pass time. Out of the blue on the first day of classes, I picked up one of the ""dollar"" books from my university library. It was *Contagion* (fitting, I know).

fiogx8,youngbull1999,4 masterpieces by F.M.Dostoyevsky,"""Brothers karamazov"","" idiot"", ""crime and punishment"" and ""demons"" are considered the 4 masterpieces. All of the books are absolutely amazing and will blow everyone away if read carefuly. Through these novels Dostoyevsky comments on all the most important aspects of our lifes: relationships, morals, religion and the meaning of life. Giving himself difficult counterarguments to whatever he is trying to teach and then answer them. The books mostly comment on similar ideas, therefore you will gain a better understaning of the same idea without it being repetitive. That is why most of his ""villains"" let's call them in their essence are the same, nihlistsic atheists who are aware of the absuridty of life, and also happent to be very smart, these characters are : Raskolnikov from crime and punishment, Ivan from Brothers Karamazov, Kirilov from Demons. All of his characters represent ideas and different personalities in which i believe most of us can find ourselves in.

In case you are interested in the books i would read them in this order. 1.Brothers Karamazov 2. Crime and punishment 3. Idiot 4.demons


If I can make atleast one person interested in the books it will make me very happy.

fini90,butter_noodles_4lyfe,Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.,"First time posting here. Just finished it, cooped up at the house. Having seen the movie countless times, I wasn’t expecting to be entertained/moved like a new story would be for me. Despite having the mental images and constant Morgan Freeman narration happening in my mind while reading, I still found myself genuinely enthralled and into it emotionally, following Red in his journey. 

Ive heard the movie-is-better-than-the-book narrative about this story in particular, but I honestly didn’t find the story lacking where the movie hit a home run. Of course, good acting helps the movie, but I find King’s writing style to be so engaging and textural, the details he offers transport me to that moment for the character (“I went to the rock, squatted beside it- the joints in my knees went off like a double-barrelled shotgun- and I let my hand touch it. It was real.”), and the small addition of noting the sound his knees make just add an additional layer of realism to a huge moment for the character, that would be otherwise only be described by his feelings about what he was doing.

I don’t know, I’m not an expert in understanding how author’s create their material and who I should be reading, etc. I just find it to be deeply enjoyable reading Stephen King for reasons like this.

fin45e,KevinDabstract,The Encyclopedia of The Dead,"Am I the only one who doesn't get the hype for this collection?

If you're interested in 20th century short stories, chances are you've heard of this book. It's generally considered one of the best collections of the century. Kis is treated like one of the most important voices in European literature from this era. You see everywhere that he's praised for ""combining fiction and history in a genius postmodern fashion"". So, of course, needing more short stories to read, I decided to pick this up in my local library. I was pretty excited to read it, because I've had a Borges shaped hole in my life since finishing everything of his I could find a while back. And Kis did sound like a pretty similar writer, albeit with his own distinct features, so I thought he would serve to scratch the spot.

And I wasn't wrong, he is similar to Borges. But that's the entire problem.

Kis reads, at least here, like he's a child only starting off as a writer. Starting off, using Borges as a template. Thinking ""man, Borges is such a cool writer, I'd love to write like him"". So that child picks up a pen, grabs a page, and tries to write Borges. Just kind of writes the first thing they can think of that he would have wrote. And it comes out pretty Borgesian. But without any of the heart or soul of Borges. It reads like someone trying to be Borges, like a store brand version. If you took Borges, took away everything that made him Borges. And then still expected him to write the same genius shit those experiences gave to him. That's who Kis is. The store brand version of Borges. His prose reads like Borges, but without any of the passion. Like if Borges had've tried to move in another direction, but kept writing Fictions type shit because it was how he made his money. It's cold, lifeless, and just makes you crave Borges more than ever. So reading the stories becomes a huge slog. But you wouldn't mind if the stories were good. Not all good books need to have good prose.

But the stories aren't good. The prose isn't the only thing that feels like a bored Borges. The very plots of the story themselves feel like they were rooted out of Borges's scrap bin. It's Borges, if he wasn't so clever. If he wasn't so meta. If he didn't feel the need to tear apart a different convention with every story he wrote. It feels like those stories every writer has where they put them away and are completely ashamed for ever having written them. The concepts are so bland. Man says Jesus bad, performs miracle. Prostitute dies, big funeral. Book of all people who die. And these stories could've been good. If Kis could have written them properly. A true master of imaginative short fiction, whether it's Borges or Kafka or Lovecraft or someone else entirely, could've made these stories genius. Could've filled them out with amazing details, made them stick in the mind. But not Kis. He just did then how Borges would have done them. But without a single inch of the boldness. Of the charm. Of the wonder. Of the power. Of the originality. Does Borges, but with none of the Borges.

According to Wikipedia, one of the stories in this collection is considered to have stolen from Borges. But not all of them. Why not all of them

However, the final (non-epilogue) chapter of the final book A Flaw In The Plan, the one where Tom Riddle dies - is masterful writing. The imagery is powerful and inspired, and every single word is focused and intentional. It’s incredible that it ties together threads from 6 other books in a totally satisfying way. It makes every re-read of the series worthwhile, and despite what I said about there being many comparable series, the ending alone does some work to elevate the Harry Potter series above its competition.",4,1584201120,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fikf2c/the_final_chapter_of_harry_potter_and_the_deathly/,books,1

fijsvd,heajyea,What are your books recommandations for non-native English speakers who want to get started in reading novels?,"My English is average-great, I can hold conversations about pretty much any general subject, I understand articles that I read online and I often read fanfictions, which most of the time use the same words and sentences structures that I already know.

My grammar isn't the best, I think I can make some silly mistakes and I'm trying to work on it. I also like writing a lot and would like to be able to write an English novel, which requires to have read lots of them first. I've only read books in my native language, and I have to admit that I haven't been reading much novels lately, as I'd rather be reading in English, and fanfictions were the easiest way for me to do that. But I'm starting to get a bit tired of reading about the same characters, the same plots and all... 

Now, I really want to improve and I've started to read a Stephen King book in English. I had a hard time actually figuring what was happening, because there were too many words I didn't get the meaning of. I don't think his books are considered hard to read, but honestly it made me lose my motivation.

 So I'm looking for something a bit easier to read, probably some YA novels, I'm also a big fan of romances or slice of life novels. Not a huge fan of fantasy or sci-fi, but any kind of recommandation will do. 

I hope you guys can give me some advice, as I'm about to go to the library to buy a few books to fight my boredom as I probably won't be able to go to work for the next couple of weeks due to covid-19.

A book I recently read and actually finished and enjoyed was ""The Girl Who Could Move Sh\*t With Her Mind"" by Jackson Ford. I like it because it's got an intriguing plot with a sci-fi undertone.

* Testosterone Rex by Cordelia Fine
* The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins
* Outgrowing God by Richard Dawkins
* The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time by Mark Haddon
* Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro
* Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life by Adam Greenfield (that was in fact a chore, I didn't understand most of it due to brain fog and apathy)

fig3ao,rhysnrivers,Odyssey to becoming a Published Author,"(Note: with Odyssey being in the title, this is quite a long post. The link to the facebook page that leads to where my novel can be bought from can be found at the bottom of the post)

So, despite never been a ‘blogger’ per se before, I’ve decided to write this article about my journey from having dreamed about writing and having my own works published, through to actually writing my ideas up and publishing them myself, as I’m sure that there are many an indie author and authoress out there who can relate and have been through the very same journey I have.

First thing’s first. Rhys N Rivers is not my real name. It’s a pen name. There’s something in being anonymous when it comes to writing, almost like a sense of freedom. This day and age of social media means that almost everything we do is recorded somewhere on the internet, and an opinion or action from ten years ago can be drudged back up to be ridiculed by the Facebook jury and/or the Karens of the internet, in line with the fashionable opinions of the day. A pen name grants anonymity and to some degree, security. The only people who know my identity are my immediate family and a few close, trusted friends.

When people embark on a new venture; be it a new hobby, learning a new language, travelling the world, changing jobs etc, the journey actually begins long before said venture starts. Quite often, the journey always begins in the classroom, at home, in bed, in daydreams. It begins as a state of ambition. A plan that one day, will be put into action.

My authoring journey was no different. Mine actually began around the age of eleven. I was of the Harry Potter generation where I was the same age as the main characters in the early years when a new film came out each year. J.K. Rowling got me into reading beyond in school, and I - being one of the cool kids, clearly - read a lot throughout my early and mid teenage years. It was admittedly predominantly fantasy based, (Tolkien, Pratchett, Philip Pullman, Garth Nix) or Bernard Cornwall’s historical works before I branched out into people like Wilbur Smith and others. When I was around 14 or 15, Dan Brown’s *The Da Vinci Code* took the world by storm and I also ended up reading all of his works. School provided a sophisticated reading list, which included Dickens and Golding, and so growing I had read through a rich and broad variety of fiction.

Where actually writing was concerned, I think it was about the age of eleven or twelve that I realised that I wanted to write properly. I think it was actually after reading William Nicholson’s *Wind Singer* when I decided, and I set to task in writing coming up with a fantasy novel. I didn’t start writing the plot straight away; I actually started coming up with characters and places, even drawing out a world map. That was really fun to do. It had a sense of total control to it. What I decided was what things were. Where a kid may not feel in control of things in other parts of life (insecurities of school, friends, growing up, relationships etc), this was something totally different. The ability to create your own fictional world, in whatever genre you go for, is a form of escape and release in which you can develop your talents and ideas.  

There were lots of elements to what I was planning out - which included ideas from *Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Legend of Zelda, The Wind on Fire* among others. To be honest, I’m actually glad that ‘project’ didn’t get very far. Poor Christopher Paolini, the author of the Inheritance Cycle quadrilogy of books, was slated by certain groups and reviewers for his alleged lack of originality and using of ideas from other stories. In Paolini’s defence, he was only fifteen when his first book was published, which is something that most fifteen year olds don’t achieve! But I think that had I completed mine, it might have faced the same criticisms - not necessarily from reviewers or publishers, but perhaps friends and family reading through it first.

School, in particular, provided me with a lot of enthusiasm and inspiration to write (clearly, I was one of the cool kids). My GCSE English teacher was a great bloke (probably still is) and gave great, honest and constructive feedback to the entire class’ work. Our first piece of English Literature coursework was a piece on creative writing and I elected to do a piece on the topic of an opening chapter/opening chapters to a novel. Having just read Dan Brown I did my piece in his sort of style: bloke copping it at the start, trying to prevent some conspiracy from going ahead, then the reluctant hero of the story gets dragged in to solving it. My piece didn’t revolve around religious groups or secret societies, but around a historical artefact.

Out of 54 marks, this scored 52. I was more than happy with that. I had no idea where the story was going to go but I was determined that I would one day finish the story. To this day, I still have no idea where the story is going, but I am certain that it will be the last novel of a set of three, dragging the main character, a desperately-can’t-wait-to-retire detective, through painstaking research, learning about history that he wouldn’t usually be arsed about and running away from people, of whom he’s becoming more and more of an embuggerance (word-invention credited to Terry Pratchett) to.

For some reason, I really can’t remember why, but about a year later the option was given to my English class to rewrite that piece of coursework (we were about four out of five coursework pieces done by that time). I was of course happy with my score but I saw this as an opportunity to try something new and see what ideas could again come spewing from my mind.

This time, again sticking with the opening chapter(s) option, I wrote about a start of a medieval conspiracy, beginning around the Battle of Crécy and going…err…I still have no idea where! But this piece resonated better than the previous piece, earning full marks from my English teacher, along with the comments “…should come with an 18 rated certificate.” Again, I vowed that I would complete this story one day and see it published. This one I think I will try to make into a three-book story.

The summer after completing my GCSE exams I did the normal stuff: went on holiday with family, chilled out with friends, even attended the World Scout Jamboree that year. But I also by then had a set of ideas in my head that I wanted to turn into novels, and wrote that list onto a computer, and saved it to my USB memory stick. I have no idea where I last saw that USB stick…

After I left school I joined the British Armed Forces. I’m not going to write too much about what I did, where I went etc (not because I was part of some uber-top-secret unit, but more-so that it just doesn’t contribute to this post) but my priorities changed. I read a lot less and writing properly in the near term future just was not a possibility, or something that I wanted to concentrate on at that time.

In early 2017 I was considering a career change, and during that time I joined [fanstory.com](http://fanstory.com/), under my real name. The purpose of doing this was to put myself into an environment with other amateur writers, gain inspiration from other budding authors (and hopefully give some inspiration back), and be in a place where my works could be read among ‘peers’, giving me a good steer on things.

It was on this website where my first novel, *Payment*, was conceived. There was a competition going for short stories up to 7000 words long in the horror genre (“Put your readers on edge or terrorize them”) and so I thought this was a good place to test out to see what people think and to develop my writing style.

It took me a couple of weeks to put *Payment* together and submit it. I had never considered writing horror before but this, again, was an ample opportunity to try something new and see what I could come up with. I decided to go with a 19th Century narrative; much like Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker. I prefer to think or the horror genre as the old neo-gothic styles of writing - the old ghost stories. Horror, in recent years, both in writing and film-making, has taken more of a gore and shock factor turn. Personally, I think that will turn horror more into the thriller genre. To me, horror should be about ghosts, vampires, witches - the occult and the supernatural. And that’s that I have tried to achieve with *Payment*. 

What surprised me the most during the writing of this were my decisions to use the first-person narrative - something I used to despise growing up, and the use of a one-word title. For some reason it used to bug me no end that it was becoming more and more common that artistic projects, be they novels, films, dance, visual art etc, would use one-worded titles. I used to think that was a cop-out. But here I am with *Payment* \- a novel told in first-person narrative…

I have always thought that my writing style was/is closest to Terry Pratchett’s. I’ve never tried to emulate him but his style of using irony, dry humour and satire, whilst also plummeting to some very deep philosophical ideas. But I couldn’t do that whilst writing *Payment*. The thing is with writing horror, is that you have to be able to maintain that macabre atmosphere all the through. That actually isn’t easy. I found there always has to be a sense of the character’s isolation, a sense of doom and gloom, and a sense of something about to happen.  

I didn’t win the completion that I entered. I don’t think it even made the top three. The votes are cast by the other entries’ writers and maybe a few other people. I can’t remember if you could vote for your own project but I think you could. The entries placed above mine, although I thought their storylines familiar with ideas already done, were admittedly much easier to read than my entry. A 19th century style of writing will always lose to simplicity when people have a number of works to read.

But that didn’t deter me. I’d created a fictional work and was determined to show it to the world. I didn’t go ahead with the career change at that point but decided to fully review *Payment*, at get it out there as a completed project.

Fanstory is a good platform, it really is. I’m not sure why, but after only a couple of months and having written a few competition entries, I came to stop writing on it. My old job was getting in the way and to be honest, I was getting impatient with writing on it. I had the mentality that I wanted to be published *right now* sort of thing.

A couple of years later, I did go ahead in a change of direction career-wise. This provided the opportunity to fully revise *Payment* and make it into a ‘novelette’, more than 7000/7500 words but fewer than 17,500. I would then prepare it for editing, get the artwork sorted and then publish it online for maybe a couple of quid.

I was actually in Tanzania at the time when I thought that *Payment* had been expanded enough to put out as a novelette. Once I’d finished writing, I showed it to a couple of the volunteers I was working with and they both enjoyed it. Although I was pleased about that, I still wasn’t satisfied with it. I had touched on quite a few themes in the work but I don’t feel like I had explored them all as much as I could have. Although complete, it felt very much incomplete. At the same time I wanted to expand the work into a full novel and also I didn’t - mainly because of the challenge of maintaining that horror atmosphere.

I decided that, in order to put more meat onto the bones and develop this short story/novelette into a full length novel, I needed a goal to work towards; something that has an end achievement that will make me work to expand on what I had already done. And so I set about looking for horror writing groups and/or competitions on the internet. 

In not much time at all I came across the Horror Writers Association (HWA). They are a group that cater for all things horror and occult in fiction. There, you can advertise your works, read or recommend other people’s works and learn about events - namely the StokerCon.

But what attracted me to them the most was their sponsorship of the Bram Stoker Awards (“for Superior Achievement”). These are awards that are given out to authors and authoresses who have had their works judged in certain categories. The one that has caught my eye is the ‘First Novel’ category. A quick reading of the rules informed me of the minimal word limit: 40,00 words. Perfect. There’s something to work towards, with a chance at winning what is described as ‘the Oscars of horror writing’. When I returned from Africa I set about the task of bolstering a 17,000-ish novelette into a 40,000 word minimum horror novel!

I have read Edgar Allan Poe in the past, and even bits of Mary Shelley. For more inspiration in keeping that spooky, Neo-Gothic atmosphere, I read some parts of Bram Stoker and H.P. Lovecraft. Despite all of that, I initially found it difficult to write again on the same piece of work that I started almost three years previously. It was only after reading Susan Hill’s *The Woman in Black*, where I became inspired by her power of description to turn chapters, paragraphs and sentences that belong in quick short stories to ones suitable for a long read.

In January, this year, I had finally finished. I expanded heavily on the ideas that I was before concerned that I was rushing through and before I knew it, my word count was well over the 40,000 words I wanted to achieve! I read it all again myself, edited out any spelling or grammar mistakes that I had seen, and sent it out to beta testers (readers) for opinions and editing.

Following the last edit - of which there wasn’t relatively much to do - my debut novel stands at a word count of 53,850 words! That isn’t considered very long by today’s standards. To give a point of reference, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone* is estimated to be around 77,000 words long (depending on who is doing the word count). But my novel is longer than *The Woman in Black* as well as other novels such as *The Great Gatsby* and *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, and considering it came from a short story of 7,000 words I am still happy with it.

Concurrently with writing the novel came the task of finding an artist/illustrator for the cover. That was a more difficult task than I expected.

Not only did I want to find someone who could create a suitable cover, I also wanted that someone to be able to do ‘scene art’; by which I mean a picture at the start of certain chapters. The reason for this is that I see a completed novel itself as a form of art, and scene pictures add to that completed projected. In fact, I actually wanted a sort of teamwork between the writing/art found in the *Edge Chronicles* books by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell.  

I combed Facebook for a very long time, joining all sorts of groups and pages for amateur artists to show off their works, hoping to find someone who I thought was suitable for my work. To my dismay, there was very little, I thought, that I could go off.

Around October time I put an advert on a freelancing work website, just for an idea of who else is out there and possibly able to take this up. I did receive a fair few responses but, again, there wasn’t really anyone whose work suited what I was after. A couple of them, one of them being an art company based in Central Asia, actually got quite nasty about it. They were expectant 

It was when I was on a course in Spain that it was suggested to me to look on Reddit, as Reddit “literally has everything on it.” I had never actually been a proper Reddit user before; I’d clicked the odd link from Facebook but had never really interacted with it before. 

The guy who suggested Reddit to me was right - Reddit has literally *everything* on it. There’s so much information to be found on so many topics it seemed unlikely that I wouldn’t find what I was looking for on it, and so I combed through a few sub-reddits dedicated to (freelance) artists and checked some of them out.

So I once again posted out an advert looking for artists and this time the response were much more positive, and enthusiastic! It really was quite uplifting to see and hear from so many people who were interested in taking up the project and I received so many messages. Everyone who commented on the post and/or messaged me with links to their portfolios, I checked out their work. I honestly don’t think there was a single person whose works of art that I wasn’t impressed by. There is so much that can be found at [deviantart.com](http://deviantart.com/) and [artstation.com](http://artstation.com/) and so much talent to be viewed and be in awe at! Everyone who directly messaged me got a return thanking them.

One of the people I got talking to was a young lad from Sweden called Daniel Percy, whose artwork I also checked out. My preferences came down to him and another guy from Germany, and after speaking with Daniel he agreed to take on the work.

Daniel does a lot of freelance art work, predominately doing concept art work for electronics companies (I want to say video games but don’t take that as gospel), but he still found the time to do this properly, compiling several drafts of the cover and inside sketches. We collaborated quite often on what to change, ideas to put in etc.

The finished artwork is incredible! I’m showing some of the initial first-sketch ideas here along with the final book cover, along with a couple of since-altered scene pictures, just for an idea of his talent. You’ll have to buy the book to see all of the finished sketches ;)

And the final thing to think/worry/mull over until stupid o’ clock in the morning, was the publishing aspect. Luckily, ever since I’ve thought about writing (as an adult), it has become increasingly easier to get your works out there. The rise of the internet and social media age has made self publishing so much more accessible, and that is the route I have gone down.

At first, I wanted to go down the traditional printing route. I - again showing cool I was as a kid - always liked the idea of a fresh and printed book in my hands. But, there are two reasons why I haven’t done this:

The first one is environmental. Even before the climate change debate became a fashionable thing to signal your virtues about, I was uncomfortable about the idea of trees being cut down for my creation, unless I could be 100% certain that exact same area would be immediately replanted. It’s true, there are forested areas specifically for this kind of thing but the amount of bureaucracy involved, along with the middle-men, wouldn’t make it an immediate thing.

The second reason is that the majority of writers who send their works in get rejected by so many publishers. Yes, people refer to J.K. Rowling’s story of being rejected twelve times (and again later by one of the same publishers when she first wrote as Robert Galbraith) before Harry Potter became a hit, but as the option of the internet is there, it makes sense to negate that possible rejection. In the event that my works do get noticed and attract the attention of publishers, then great! But if they don’t, at least by online publishing, I’ve still achieved putting my novel out to the world.

Finally, today, Friday the 13th (intentionally - it is a horror novel after all ;p ) of March 2020, I officially became a published author. It is a fantastic, monumental feeling. My story, my novel, my creation, is out there for people to buy, read and hopefully, enjoy.

If there’s any advice that I can give for anyone aspiring to be an (indie) author, it is this: just write your ideas down. Sounds simple, if not downright obvious, but it really is incredible that so many people don’t achieve their dreams or aspirations simply because they don’t do them. The world of authoring and indie writing is so much more accessible now than it was even fifteen years ago, that is takes a great lot of effort **not** to find at least one platform to get your works out onto.

It is also incredibly easy to find every excuse in the book to not write at all. School, work, family etc, being the big ones, and they are legitimate reasons. But they are only obstacles themselves to an extent, before you yourself make them obstacles. Start small. Set yourself half an hour on an evening. No more, no less. Half an hour to start getting your ideas onto paper and then after a week, you’ve spent three and a half hours writing. You’d be surprised at how much you’ve achieved after three and a half hours of concentrated effort.

If you need motivation, there are plenty of people out there, particularly on the internet, who give great examples of motivation that apply to all disciplines. Joe Rogan, for just one example, has plenty of people on his podcasts who talk and give advice on self-betterment, and it can apply to anybody. If you want to write, you will find the time and means to do it. It doesn’t matter how long it takes; everybody finds their ways at different times. 

As to my next works, what am I going to be writing next? Well, shortly after writing *Payment* as a short story I thought of another idea to write about, and use that particular project to actually develop my writing style. This next one, of which the first ‘act’ as such does already have a skeleton outline to it, is a light hearted yet philosophical at times medieval adventure, combining humour and seriousness together. I’m not going to divulge ay more information the storyline because, although it’s a simple idea, I believe it’s one that no-one’s done before and some smart-arse with more time on their hands than I can easily bash something together using my idea!

The school coursework pieces? They are still on my ideas list and will no doubt be developed into their own proper projects and they hopefully will also be published just as *Payment* is! The fantasy that I started aged eleven? Absolutely no idea. Whilst I would certainly like to do fantasy, going for originality is going to be difficult, as the standard format (young hero finds out he’s the ‘chosen one’ and goes on a long quest) has been done to death, as have a lot of fantasy ideas already. George R R Martin had the idea of using the idea of old English houses warring against other in the past, and that was used to great effect even before he threw in the ice zombies! So that one is going to be a case of properly allocating some time to sit down, think and decide how I’m going to go about, but make no mistake, I will go about it!

Thank you all for taking the time to read through this! I hope its provided at least some entertainment or light (ha!) reading, and I hope you’ll feel interested to buy my debut novel!

ficlo2,Helvetica28,Normal People by Sally Rooney devastatingly broke my heart... and I loved it,"I have seen mixed reviews for the novel, but I personally found it unbelievably profound in its emotional honesty and complexity. Rooney conveys the complicated and often contradictory emotions people feel through her detailed descriptions. Rather then blatantly state how the characters feel, she reveals it through implications and dialogue.

The whole story has so paragraphs that I had to stop reading and just... absorb. Connel and Marianne are flawed, but real. I can’t help but caught up in there changing relationship and experience their feelings. Rooney absolutely nails anxiety- I knew that was apart of Connell life before it was revealed. I could honestly spend hours dissecting all the characters and their actions. This book has so much to unpack!

Personally, I view the ending as hopeful and romantic. I think Connel and Marianne, albeit still flawed, grew a lot as individuals and a couple.

I'd like to have a concrete set of characters POVs. Maybe with some additions here and there, like in The Witcher books. Sometimes you have an unique POV to tell a concrete scene and that's cool, but it happens from time to time.

Should I keep reading the next ones? I like the world and the story seems interesting (just started with Darujhistan so please no spoilers).",14,1584148878,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fiamqj/im_reading_the_first_book_of_malaz_but_im_not/,books,1

fi9lu4,fomorian,Guess the title:sci-fi/fantasy book that explored the ramifications of a corona-like virus,"Hi guys, I thought I'd play a guess the title of a book. The reason it's so relevant now is that it took the idea of deadly virus and ran with it. The book is set in the not too distant future where society has been organized into castes based on their social status, a bit like the Hindu system. If you are in the Leisure caste, you look down on the Businessmen, if you are a Businessman, you look down on the Administrators, and so on until you get to Labourers. Physical contact between castes was not strictly prohibited. 

Gradually throughout the book, it's revealed that this caste system was instituted to fend off a mutated form of the rabies virus which was impossible to cure and had a 100% mortality. This pandemic devasted the society centuries in the past from when the book is set resulting in a society obsessed with castes. 

While not a strict one to one comparison since Corona clearly doesn't kill everyone it infects, it's still interesting to see the behavioural changes that have come about since the short amount of time its been announced. Wearing facemasks is now considered so much more acceptable than it was twenty or even ten years ago (in the west at least), and I feel like this scare is going to accelerate people's adoption of online learning and work from home situations (funny how a global pandemic is needed for that to happen). 

So I thought I'd give kudos to the almost precient description of the behavioural changes that came about as the direct result of a pandemic. Hopefully someone is able to recognize the book from just this description, but if not I'll post more hints in the comments. 

To preempt any accusations of false advertising, I just want to add that the book is more fantasy than sci-fi, with the sci-fi future serving as more of a backdrop for the swords and sorcery thing, albeit with a gritty refreshing spin on the genre. Hopefully someone recognizes it, otherwise this is going to be embarrassing.",1,1584144449,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fi9lu4/guess_the_titlescififantasy_book_that_explored/,books,1

It was about this girl who was put into a re-education camp because one country had invaded her homeland.  At the camp she acted rebellious and at one point had to be put to hard labor.  Then she acted in a play praising the invading nation.  Though, she caused the entire production to fail.  She then barricades herself and the entire school within the camp at the face of an army.

fi95zp,TheKidEternity,Books for the Bored,"I have this thing because of depression and it might be my ocd too, but I find keeping to just one book very hard. I've read quite a lot over the past year. I used to be all about gay fiction when I was young, but I'm into a lot of non fic, true crime, and facts. Facts are a lot easier for me. I try to pick books that have short chapters on different people or things, but I'm in need of more. NBA, NHL and my library are all closed for the rest of this month. I'm into true crime(more forensics), I read comics(a lot of the one off ones), and fact books. I try to take it little chapter, by little chapter, but I can't read just one book. I have to have many around me. Jump from one to another. 

I would like some horror(something truly scary. I'm not scared of a lot of things. I've seen some gruesome things so...) plus I want to write my own horror.

Thought “oh about a plague wiping out humanity, I’ve read this story a million times before.” 

Oh man, was I wrong. 

The way King describes the outbreak from page one, to where I am now (about halfway) is beautifully haunting. The way he is so specific and detailed about how someone coughs in the back of a movie theater. Or how the poor family who had kids who played with all the other kids at the hotel, and they all infected everyone else, and so forth, is terrifying.

Obviously, my mouth gets tired of pronouncing the words and so I end up having short reading sessions.

When I try reading in silence, it's like if my eyes glance over the words so fast that I cannot even process what I'm reading. I'll read an entire paragraph or two and won't even process what I'm reading. I try to slow down with my eyes and take my sweet time, but it's quite difficult to do that. It's almost as if my eyes have this intense inclination to want to glance over the text, and it's quite difficult for me to slow it down. 

Is this a normal issue? What measures can I take to overcome this issue?

fi4ilf,rispidara,"From Rafael Landivar to Jordan B. Peterson, the books I read in 2020","***Rusticatio Mexicana*** **- Rafael Landivar**

&amp;#x200B;

Somewhere between Virgil and Lucretius.  The *Rusticatio* fits into the tradition of didactic poetry: the author poses as teacher, in this case with the general theme of “life in the New World.” The translation can be a bit stiff but the latin flows beautifully.

&amp;#x200B;

***Excitability*** **- Diane Williams**

&amp;#x200B;

Williams's narrator strips off the surface layer of the everyday world and reveals to us what we often label inappropriate: our fierce lust for strangers or our own siblings; frank sexual encounters; misbehavior at a cocktail party. It is not merely the uniqueness of her narrator's perspective that marks Williams's work, but also the sense that these revelations of what lies beneath the material world set the narrator free, from the everyday, from family obligations, from social proprieties and expectations, all of which can stifle the soul. 

&amp;#x200B;

***A Dance to the Music of Time*** **- Anthony Powell**

&amp;#x200B;

A twelve-volume roman-fleuve that covers 50 years of history; comparable to the best Proust, Balzac, Zola... Pure joy.

&amp;#x200B;

***José Ortega y Gasset*** **-  Jordi Gracia**

&amp;#x200B;

Biographies aren't for me. Too many cups and and very little wine.

&amp;#x200B;

***Journal*** **- Valéry Larbaud**

&amp;#x200B;

In flagrante delicto. I've nothing to say.

&amp;#x200B;

***Das achte Leben*** **- Nino Haratischwili**

fi3ww2,DarkHeraldMage,"Just finished ""The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"" by Anne-Marie O'Connor and it was amazing!","I have wanted to read this book for years, ever since I found out about the movie that somewhat recently came out to tell the tale of the beautiful WWII era painting that the book is named for; I did the unthinkable and watched the movie first, only to realize after the fact that it was based on a book, and immediately added it to my TBR. It took me a couple years, but I finally got around to it and I am so happy I did. This post will not contain any specific spoilers, though it's an overall exultation of wonder at the beautiful book and the historical topics it touches on, so anything spoiled will be vague and in reference to well-known world events.

Non-fiction isn't normally my thing, I openly admit that. I run a huge book club server on Discord and non-fiction stuff is probably less than 10% of the books and authors people discuss on a daily basis; while that's not a bad thing per se as everyone has their own interests, I've made it a personal goal of mine over the past couple years to increase the amount of non-fiction I read to ensure my whole life isn't *just* amazing books about magic and futuristic space empires. I picked up ""The Lady in Gold"" thinking it'd be similar to the movie I'd seen, focusing entirely on a single famous painting and the legal battle that happened within the past 15 years to get it back from the Austrian government/art museums and into the hands of the descendants of the family that originally owned it - I was so very misinformed.

This book spends the first 75% talking about the time before the second World War, the high society families that lived in Austria, the painters that rose to fame (and sometimes infamy), and then lead into the Nazi regime's rise to power and Hitler's hyper focus on art as it pertained to Jewish painters or Jewish subjects in paintings. I started this book with the high level knowledge that Hitler had tried to be an artist early in life and failed, but I knew nothing more than that, and this book taught me everything about it and showed just how much that failure seemed to motivate many of his actions.

When finally getting past WWII and into life after the war, this book shows what the idea of reparations can mean, and the hurdles to provide such a restitution to victims of terrible crimes; as an American who has heard the idea suggested of reparations for the many years of slavery that occurred in our nation's past, it was so powerful to see a different kind of reparation discussed, sought out, and ultimately distributed (in some cases, not all). Imagining that on a scale here is mind boggling, and I don't know that it could ever happen, though more than ever I really wish that in some way it could.

I rambled this long to boil it down to this - if you're seeking a non-fiction book to pick up, and are at all interested in the WWII era or especially in the world of art, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Be prepared for a deluge of details, but know that they are so worth knowing. With much love and respect for the beautiful Adele Bloch-Bauer, I wish you all the best. &lt;3",5,1584122721,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fi3ww2/just_finished_the_lady_in_gold_the_extraordinary/,books,1

fi3q4f,jeansoule,Reading Camus “The Plague” during a World Outbreak of Covid-19,"I read and finished The Plague recently, with the recent events that plague everyone and their mother’s social timeline, I thought it’d be apt. The parallels between reality and fiction are bountiful, I sat there in complete awe as the words in a book written almost a century ago resemble the now. I would like to share some of my thoughts and maybe even persuade you to read it, let’s begin. 

You are introduced to Dr. Rieux in the first sentence when he walks out into the street after seeing a patient, he encounters a dead rat as he leaves, and thus we begin. The outbreak is centered in a town called Oran in Algeria. People begin to have symptoms of the bubonic plague; days pass and people do not seek medical attention. The government refuses to acknowledge any sort of outbreak and newspapers downplay the severity of the oncoming outbreak with drastically reduced cases. Eventually the governments hand is forced from an uproar from the public but continue to drag their feet. People no longer go out and daily life is disrupted and people have more time on their hands than they know what to do with. Thousands are separated from loved ones who are overseas. The death toll is reverberated throughout the streets daily by speaker announcements, the town becomes a former shell of itself. 

We are slowly introduced to a cast of characters throughout the first part of the novel that are vital to the theme. Each of these characters are unique in the way they deal with the calamity that abruptly comes upon the town. We have the journalist Rambert, who is unlucky enough to only be visiting the town when the plague strikes and also ironically there to report on the health of the general public of Oran, thus leaving him stranded in the town as the government finally closes down docks and roads preventing any further spread. He panics as he feels isolated and separated from loved ones back home, he is not part of Oran. He seeks escape. Rambert signifies cowardice in time of communal strife. Then we have Father Paneloux, he is the local priest of Oran. He continues to hold mass even with the spread of disease, in his sermons he states that the plague was brought upon the people of Oran for their sins! That you have nothing to fear if you do right by God. Paneloux represents the seeking of solace and religion in times of collective calamity. Finally we have Dr.Rieux, a man who uses all his resources in trying to stop the plague. He believes Paneloux to be simply an ignorant fool who has not even seen how horrible the deaths are first hand and Rambert who simply just wants to be reunited with his lover back in France justified in his action of escape. When Rambert finally has a means of escape the next day he visits The Dr. and his colleague to announce his departure, all farewells and condolences are said, then Rieux’s colleague pulls Rambert to the side and informs him that Rieux also has a lover who is in another country far away, at that moment something clicked in Rambert. The next day Rambert does not get on the boat to escape and decides to join the health forces created by Rieux and his colleagues. Rieux signifies hope.

This was only the tip of how philosophical this novel can be. I just can’t be bothered to write more. If this write up interested you at all, I would totally recommend a read. I only went over a few major characters and the first half of the novel, there is much much more.

fi2km3,EdgarAllen_Br0,“Fun” Books,"I recently got a free subscription to Audible, and have been using the absolute hell out of it. I’ve put in 3 days of listening in about 3 months - maybe not a ton for some people but a huge shift to me! 

I’m currently finishing “A Brief History of Seven Killings” by Marlon James and I absolutely love it. It’s as gripped as I’ve ever been by a story and it’s characters. Thing is, it gets pretty brutal to read at some points. Between the explicit rapes, murder, and overall depressing atmosphere I feel like i need to “detox” with my next choice. 

Keep in mind, I’m pretty green when it comes to choosing books to read. I’ve read a few Stephen King books recently, as well as 2 by Cormac McCarthy (Blood Meridian is probably my favorite I’ve ever read).

My roommate read the audiobook and my girlfriend briefly glanced at the book cover and neither were merely as affected. I couldn't put the book down. I felt more gross with every high and low. His desperation to learn towards the beginning, Gatsby always looking at whatever the green light was supposed to be across the water, Holden Caufield breaking his sister's jazz record in the park, my lack of emotional development, how Stephen King wrote that one character that tries to kill him. How Anne Frank doesn't even know what Europe looks like, and her father living with the guilt of reading her smut. The fact he is never able to push past his desire to become like his dad James Potter greatest wiz kid of all time. How brief and bittersweet the blossoming of his heart is at the end when it grows 3 sizes and he lifts the sleigh back down to WhoVille... I don't even know how I feel or what I want for him... he sacrifices people at the bakery and turns them into meat pies, the other guys despite their flaws started to look out for him again, a bunch of other unambiguous plot points listed out with commas.

I jerked a few white tears at the end of Lolita, if only for the beauty of the writing. I did that a few times in The Sound and The Fury Road. When I was 14 I cried when my Dad threw out How to Train Your Dragon because it felt like I had lost my closest friends. But I've never had a book break me down like this one. Every moment has significance in Charlie's brief chocolate factory tour. And so much of that significance gives fuel to very human sorrow wow.

In the demon-haunted world that we inhabit by virtue of being human, this may be all that stands between us and the enveloping darkness.”

I felt that this quote and the entire book is extremely timely for our present times. The scientific method can be applied to all areas of our life...

fi0zzo,leowr,Lets Talk About One of Those Other Ursula K. Le Guin books: Changing Planes,"I don't think I've ever seen anyone talk about *Changing Planes*, even though Ursula K. Le Guin comes up quite often. Changing Planes is more of a collection of different stories that all center around the same idea. A woman named Sita Dulip was at the airport and dealing with the all familiar experience of delayed flights, cancelled flight and the frustrating lack of information regarding alternative travel options, when:

&gt;She had discovered that, by a mere kind of twist and a slipping bend, easier to do than to describe, she could go anywhere - be anywhere - because she was *already between planes*.

She thus discovered a way to travel from the airport to different planes and discover different worlds and perhaps have a little vacation while you wait for your flight to finally be called. 

I can imagine Le Guin coming up with the concept while she was bored waiting for her flight. Why didn't she just get a book to read at the airport you ask. To quote from *Changing Planes*:

&gt;The airport bookstore did not sell books, only bestsellers, which Sita Dulip cannot read without risking a severe systemic reaction. 

The majority of the book consists of a sort of travel log in which the narrator of the book describes several different planes they have visited and the societies they encountered there. There is a whole range of worlds that Le Guin describes, for example a world in which dreams are shared together, a world in which everyone but a select few are royalty, a world in which people have feathers instead of hair and several more. 

In her descriptions of the world Le Guin tackles problems and issues we deal with, for example genetic experiments, how language works, how conflicts between nations can escalate and go on for generations, how we look at celebraties, etc. I have always thought scifi, and fantasy, is a great way to take a look at those kinds of issues, as it allows us to place the issue in a new setting. 

Probably my favorite world that Le Guin described in the book was in *Seasons of the Ansarac,* which was inspired by the Ospreys of McKenzie Bridge. The world is inhabited by a people that are described as:

&gt;about seven feet tall, thin, strong, angular, a little stooped by age, with a narrow head, large round, black-and-gold eyes, and a beak.

The Ansarac follow a Way, in that the migrate between their two habitats depending on the season, like birds. Depending on the season, and habitat, they live very different lives. When their world was visited by outsiders from other planes, the Ansarac were influenced to stop their migration as they should stop giving in to ""their animal instincts"", but that caused its own problems. I thought the story took a very good look at how outside influence can change how you live your life, but the changes may not always be for the best. 

Overall, I think Le Guin did a great job of describing a whole range of different worlds and questioned certain concepts in a way that made me think about them.

The oscillation between liking Harold and not liking him. People tossing away their suspicions because it's just a feeling (despite the fact that they followed a feeling halfway across the country). Stu is the worst for it, since right from the get go he understood harold's intentions, right from the very first moment they met, and now after all this time and bad blood he's supposed to lose his intuition? 

It feels like they've all just lost a big chunk of their intellect as part of this Boulder move. Is it the thin air?

fhyfpj,imnotthatguyiswear,I'm reading 8 books at the same time and I think it's making me a little bit happy-mad.,"And that's not counting several short story collections (6), a book of Shakespeare's sonnets, and a collection of Nabokov's letters to his wife. Because I can pause any of those for days, weeks, months and not worry about losing my place.

It's like there are layers to my pile of books. ""Faster/lighter"" books are on top and the ""heavier/slower"" books are at the bottom. The general idea is that I read and finish the fast books to gain momentum and get through the slower books. But it seems like I keep adding more to the pile. Don't get me wrong -- I want to read all of these books, but it's like they're slow or taking too long and my drop desire for story keeps jumping to the next fresh thing. And it just keeps piling up and up and up. Now it seems like there's no end, no way to reach the bottom of the pile, and it's driving me nuts. Any suggestions, folks? 

For those who are curious, the 8 books I'm reading are...

1. Lincoln in the Bardo, because I was awake at 4am and suddenly had a desire to reread my favourite book. I stayed up until 5.30am that day because of that book. 

2. Peter Pan, because I'm reading it to my girlfriend whenever we call on the phone. She's never read it, I've read it at least 7 times. She's enjoying it, by the way. 

3. Station Eleven, because I was two chapters in when that 4am episode with Lincoln happened. 

4. The God Delusion, because I find religion and atheism are both fascinating ideas. 

5. Justice by Michael Sandel, because I'm studying law, and I find the philosophy of morality and policy/law making fascinating as well. 

6. Flow, because I'm stressed out a lot and a formula for happiness sounded nice at the time.

7. Heir to the Empire, because I love Star Wars but The Rise of Skywalker was so abysmally disappointing that I need a cure. 

8. The Way of Kings, because everyone says it's great (500 pages in and I'm still waiting). But to be fair, there are some parts that are pleasant. This one has been on the back burner the longest.",11,1584100369,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhyfpj/im_reading_8_books_at_the_same_time_and_i_think/,books,1

fhxyp1,dreamerimagine1,I love Japanese literature but I don't like Murakami...,"I love Japanese literature, to be more specific, I love Japanese short stories but despite trying hard, I'm not enjoying Murakami's books. I feel that they are too meandering and he focuses less on the things which matter. For example, in Kafka on the Shore, I was entirely intrigued and absorbed by Kafka and Miss Saeki's story. The possibility of Kafka being the reincarnation of Ms. Saeki's dead lover or Kafka's father being Johnny Walker were super cool. But instead we get pages about Hoshino and Colonel Sanders, which I could not connect to. Nakata was endearing but I'd rather have a separate novella for Nakata as I would like to focus more on Kafka's story. Also, Sakura played such a small role in the book. I'm also perturbed by how Murakami's female characters lack complexity. They are either manic pixie dreamgirl like Midori and Sakura, or the wounded, quiet one like Naoko and Midori. I loved Norwegian Wood but I would love to see more of Toru-Naoko-Reiko interaction and I couldn't see how Midori and Nagasawa added to the story. Midori and Nagasawa were such fascinating characters and I would love to see them in a separate book but I didn't see them contributing in Toru's story. (It felt a little hypocritical how Toru considered Nagasawa was not a good person when Toru was in fact doing the same things).

I don't know why I cannot enjoy Murakami as others interested in Japanese literature adore him. I absolutely loved short stories- Hell Screen by Akutagawa, Dreams of Love by Mieko Kawakami, A tale of two lifetimes by Fumiko Enchi and maybe they are my favorite works of literature I've ever read but Murakami's writing doesn't engage me as much.",32,1584097795,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhxyp1/i_love_japanese_literature_but_i_dont_like/,books,1

Yesterday, I finished Dracula and not having anything to read further, I picked up Oliver Twist retold by Richard Rogers. I have not yet finished it even though, I am half way across the book. And I found its writing so simple and understandable. I was so impressed by it. It maintained its simplicity while narrating an almost depressing story.

I wanna know of the original version of Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is also so simple. Or is it just the magic of Richard.

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

I read it in middle school, so it is probably a young adult novel or somewhere around that age group.

So, and as I should have done by now, I very much would like to read the book. However, in searching for a copy I am only finding a “New Revised Edition”, “75th Anniversary Edition”, and one stating only, “Metropolis: The Classic Novel of the City of the Future”. So, for anyone who knows, when it comes to particular works (and this one certainly qualifies) I’m really only interested in reading the version, in English, that is as close to the original as is available. I want to read it as the author wrote it. So how do I know which to buy?

fhu1la,A_Third_Past_Four,"In Light of Recent Events, I'd Like to Discuss My Two Favorite ""Apocalypse"" Stories","Neal Stephenson's 2015 novel [Seveneves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves) was a bit technical for me, but I toughed it out. One part that really stuck with me was the general peace of the masses once it was widely known that the bolide would lead to so many perishing. I used to have recurring dreams about an asteroid apocalypse, and in a similar way, the people just gathered with their loved ones and watched it happen. Who's to say how our end will be, but I know I won't be doing all sorts of crazy shit just because.

The other, my favorite books, Margaret Atwood's [Oryx and Crake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryx_and_Crake) trilogy, is significantly different in the mechanism and handling of humanity's demise. Of course its premise is much more speculative and person-focused, but I do still chill at the thought of the Flood, and fear that the chaos it describes might come to pass in my lifetime. I fear that humanity, even if I'm not around to see it, won't get a quick or calm oblivion. 

I also fear for the state of learning, on a kind of cosmic scale. Even if there are others out there, they won't have the earth human perspective. We're important, for the stories we tell and the stories we make.

fhtu9k,OkCricket2,Optimism &amp; the ending of The Catcher in the Rye,"Just finished reading this book and I have to say, I'm a little confused by the rather optimistic interpretation others seem to have of its ending. Personally, I interpreted the ending as a suggestion that Holden is still stuck in his unhealthy mindset - he's in a psych ward and while he does have plans to go back to school, he seems unsure of how school will work out for him again. He also doesn't seem to show any clear signs of improvements in his pessimistic, angsty outlook on life. I guess I'm just hoping that somebody could clarify what events in the book suggest that Holden has in fact changed and improved his mental state. Many people suggest that this book really helped them with their own struggles and transitions in life, but I guess it's hard for me to see how a book could do that when I can't see the optimism in it?

fht91i,3kool5you,Just finished Frankenstein and Dracula back to back and I must discuss!(spoilers),"Had a post a few days ago Dracula. Really enjoyed the book and was excited to read it for a while. Loved the horror elements, the history, and seeing the birth of the modern day vampire tropes.

I didn’t have as high expectations for Frankenstein, but still wanted to read it since I knew it was another classic and never knew the full story. Wow- I was completely blown away. 

Dracula was a wonderful horror novel, but Frankenstein was just an incredible, depressing novel that constantly provoked philosophical dread. Of course I heard the story of Frankenstein and knew the age old adage “wisdom is knowing Frankenstein IS the monster”, but the book is so much more complex than those basic themes that it is known for. 

I love that you are constantly on a roller coaster of pity and frustration for both Frankenstein, and his monster. I pitied Frankenstein at times, and hated his decisions at others. I pitied the monster for being outcast, but still hated that he resorted to killing innocents to make up for it. 

And the entire time I’m left wondering: was Frankenstein *really* wrong? In many ways he was, for creating a child and then abandoning it and refusing to give it a chance. But when his monster showed clearly that it was capable of death and vengeance, it *killed* his brother, was Frankenstein wrong to refuse to create another? He was right, what if they didn’t get along and the female monster was violent and didn’t share his desire for peace? 

The whole time I just wanted him to create the second monster and go on with his life, but his logic actually made sense, and then seemed supported when the monster did go on a killing spree of innocents just for revenge.

What was interesting too is that in common media, the creation itself of Frankenstein’s monster is mentioned like it’s a big part of the novel, but the details of it really barely encompass a few pages. 

I really can’t stop thinking about this book. Pure excellence.",18,1584069867,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fht91i/just_finished_frankenstein_and_dracula_back_to/,books,1

fhsjm9,winwining,Did Chief Bromden actually escape the mental hospital? (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest),"We finished reading this book in English today. Take this with a grain of salt, but my English teacher says that she had a student years back whose father had actually been able to attend an event with Ken Kesey. Ken Kesey had told them that actually, Bromden returned to the mental hospital despite what the ending may make it seem. (My teacher also qualified by saying that it was possibly that Ken Kesey was extremely drugged up at that point of time, or could have been making a joke. She chooses to believe that Bromden escaped.) 

I did some digging, and dismayingly, there seems to be a case for the possibility of this being true. The beginning chapter is told in present tense and ends with Bromden saying that he needs to ""tell\[\] about all this, about the hospital, and her, and the guys -- and about McMurphy"" and that ""it's the truth even if it didn't happen."" Then the rest of the book is told in past tense, making it a strong possibility that the whole book in Bromden is telling a story of McMurphy that already occurred in the past. 

This is also supported by the fact that Bromden leaves the mental hospital on the same path that the dog did (previously, he saw a dog and a car going in the same direction, implying the dog was hit, symbolizing how society prevails over the individual), which could hint that Bromden did escape but was captured and returned to the mental institution. 

Also, Bromden remembers details of his past in the first chapter, when the rest of the book we see him not remember his past and only remember it due to McMurphy's influence.   


Finally, although Chief Bromden ended up talking at the end of the book, in no point in the book does it indicate that Bromden speaks to any of the staff members, keeping it consistent with the beginning when he states that all the staff members think he's deaf and dumb and would not contradict this possibility. 

What do you guys think? Happy to discuss with you all :)))",15,1584066713,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhsjm9/did_chief_bromden_actually_escape_the_mental/,books,1

fhs183,nothingtimestwo,I just finished Flowers for Algernon and towards the end I was actually sobbing. Am I alone in how much this book affects me?,"Spoiler warnings below. Sorry if this is a repeat topic I know the book is popular.

My roommate has read it and my girlfriend read excerpts of it too and neither were nearly as affected. I couldn’t put the book down. I felt more engrossed with every high and low. His desperation to learn in the beginning, his frustration with being treated as a human experiment, his lack of emotional development, how his mom descends into senility and tries to kill him. How he doesn’t even know whether he has assaulted his sister, and his sister will live with the guilt of his expulsion. The fact he is never able to push past his desire to have Rose see him as normal and accept him. How brief and bittersweet is the blossoming of his relationship with Alice. He barely realizes the beauty of it before it is gone. When he starts to deteriorate at the end and he wants so badly to hold onto his pride and his image that he does it all alone. On the last page when he decides to go to the Warren home... I don’t even know how I feel or what I want for him... he sacrifices having friends at the bakery, the other guys despite their flaws started to look out for him again, he could have at least had that. But he didn’t. And what hurts the most is throughout it all, even if he becomes irritable, or arrogant, or a know-it-all, he wants to help the world and people like him. He remembers the people who are important to him. 

I shed a few tears at the end of Lolita, if only for the beauty of the writing. I did that a few times in The Sound and the Fury. And when I was 14 I cried at the end of His Dark Materials because it felt like I had lost my closest friends. But I’ve never had a book break me down like this one. Every moment has significance in Charlie’s brief lucidity. And so much of that significance gives fuel to very human sorrow. In these past few hours of my life Daniel Keyes has given me something incredible that I may never experience again.",618,1584064537,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhs183/i_just_finished_flowers_for_algernon_and_towards/,books,1

fhpplg,HopelessMonolingual,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this, but I'll ask anyways.","Since the start of the week I've been assigned by my dad as a tutor for my cousin. He has had somewhat poor parenting, and since his dad passed away due to old age, he pretty much has no father figure left for him except for maybe my dad. He's currently failing in math and history (he's starting high school), and I'm tutoring him so he can at least pass his classes this marking period. 

For the time being, it seems that he'll be alright in math. But history is another problem. I initially thought that his problem was due to poor study habits, but the real problem is that he struggles to read. He's not super illiterate or anything, but after asking him to read passages from his history textbook out loud, I can tell he has problems recognizing and pronouncing words. Additionally, unless he is given a simple fact retrieval question, he has problems summarizing what he just read. Because of problems like this, he finds almost no pleasure in reading and has almost no desire to improve. It's a vicious cycle. 

I thus concluded that if he wants to be successful in school in the long run, he must absolutely improve his reading comprehension. \*However, I feel that me teaching him how to read is like a concert pianist teaching me how to play piano.\* Just because you're good at something doesn't necessarily mean you're good at teaching it. 

And this is why I'm writing this post for this subreddit. (If there's a better subreddit for a post like this, by all means tell me.) Do you have any suggestions on how I can work on improving my cousin's reading comprehension? Both me and my dad really want him to succeed so he can have a better life than his parents.

fhpkh7,CountVertigo,The Wych Elm by Tana French - third act question [super spoilery],"This is going to be super-spoilery discussion of The Wych Elm (Witch Elm in America), which is a crime story in which the protagonist (a civilian, not law enforcement) has his cushy life gradually broken down by disability, PTSD, family trouble and an intense criminal investigation. It's extremely immersive, and being a 34-year-old guy with a chronic illness, I found the lead character completely plausible, relatable and well-written, if not necessarily 100% likeable. Reviews generally agree that the book's main flaw is that it's too long - one section in particular, which is the subject of this post. If you haven't read the book, but may do at some point, please stop reading now.

\*\*\*

Okay. So I had a major problem with the direction the book took near the end, after the big whodunnit reveal. Looking online, it seems this is a common view. So - Toby essentially snaps, wrecking even what remains of his life, leading to rather a grim ending. But the reason for the snap is unexplained, and to me it almost felt like it came out of nowhere. By the end of the book, we're left with almost no unfilled gaps in Toby's memory - except for this one. And it's what that whole bleak(ish) ending hinges around. Here's the extract (p481 of 511 in the UK hardback):

&gt;!I couldn't answer that; I could barely breathe. ""I'm not saying I would've ever taken things that far,"" he \[Detective Rafferty\] reassured me. ""I wouldn't've. Hand to God. I'm not in the business of sending innocent men down for murder. But the thing is, I didn't need to. I just needed Hugo to think I would. That's why I went for you over Leon. Because Hugo knew as well as I did, if you got into a courtroom, you'd be f\*\*ked.""!&lt;

&gt;!He said something else to me then. I can still see the equivocal spark of a smile lighting his face and I've spent hundreds or maybe thousands of hours trying to remember what it was he said but I can't, because just as he started saying it I realised that I was about to punch him in the face, and just as he finished saying it I hit him.!&lt;

...After which, it seems like Rafferty is eager for Toby to fight him, and he doesn't back off at any point. Not initially, when it would have been professional, and not later after being heavily injured, which would have been common sense. He beckons Toby on, acts like a fighter, snarls like an animal, and does a large amount of damage. It seems like a reprisal of what happened to Toby in the first chapter - that he *wanted* to kill him, or at least beat him back into hospital. So it seems to me that maybe that unknown piece of dialogue may have been Rafferty trying to bait Toby into attacking? If so - why?

What does everyone else think? I've been trying to find a statement from Tana French on this vital missing chunk of the narrative, but coming up blank. I'm not even finding discussion anywhere, and frankly the inconclusiveness is kind of making my brain itch. So I'd love to know if anyone has any views on what Rafferty said to trigger this, and what the goal was - or links to Tana French spilling the beans somewhere.",1,1584054389,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhpkh7/the_wych_elm_by_tana_french_third_act_question/,books,1

fhnvvo,Lupinfujiko,Bonnie Macbird Sherlock Holmes Series,"I was a huge Sherlock Holmes Fan growing up.  I mean really, who wasn't.

Well, Bonnie Macbird has written three [new Sherlock Holmes](https://macbird.com/) adventures now.  And I have to say they are fantastic.

They are just like the Sherlock Holmes Adventures by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself.  Maybe even better.  More modern language, easier to understand, maybe even more plot twists.  They are certainly page-turners.

True to the characters, true to the plot and atmosphere of London in the 1880s.  Simply fantastic.

I highly recommend this series if you like Sherlock Holmes.  I just finished the second one and I'm starting the third right away.  

It reminds me of my childhood.  I love Sherlock Holmes!!  It's great to have him revived and solving mysteries again!

I'm so happy she wrote these, and I hope she continues.

&gt; Kiji, I've done nothing unusual. What mortal have I actively or directly harmed? 
&gt; You shielded him with your statue- 
&gt; To prevent harm is not the same as causing harm. Our agreement stands. 
&gt; You argue like one of Lutho's paid litigators- 
&gt; Leave me out of it, brothers and sisters. Though I do note that the distinction between acts of omission and commission has troubled philosophers for- 
&gt; Enough! I will let this one go, Fithowéo. This one time.

* Which of the gods do you agree with? Is preventing directly intervening? What do you think of the involvement of gods so far?

* What did you think of King Jizu's actions when Rima surrendered to Namen? 

* Did it surprise you that Mata and Kuni ended up being friends? Who do you agree with in regards to those that attack/betray Cocru?

fhlvlk,zRoyce,What is your reading process/routine?,"How do you go about starting and finishing a book? Do you like you binge 3-5 chapters a day or read 1 or 2 and let it marinate in your head? Do you set out to read a certain # of chapters a week and try to pace yourself or do you only read on weekends/read whenever you can because of the type of job you have (labor-intensive)? Do you take notes on plot and characters, especially in fantasy series where there can be a lot of characters and places to remember. Do you crossover into different series after reading 1 book of a particular series or do you like to finish a full series before jumping into another? I just started reading again so I'm curious to know what you guys/gals do with your routine. I've always been an organization freak/MS Word junkie so I personally like to create folders for every series I'm about to jump into and have sections for reading essentials such as notes and characters and sections of mythology/lore to keep track of the world-building aspects of a series. I also like to read slow and pace myself so i understand each chapter better (and because of work) but by doing that, I sometimes forget things that happened in chapter 3 by the time I'm on chapter 57 of a book, hence why i keep all the word docs. In short, here are some screenshots of how i organize everything.

fhlmc8,The_Almighty_Bob,The critique in the rye,"Influenced by the popularity of the book on reddit I decided to give it a try.

I think the book is a bit overhyped. But that maybe because I'm not able to relate with it as well as most of the other people are able to. The book is definitely slow with not much happening between the covers and includes too many unnecessary details that hold no significance with either the plot or the character formation. Here in this review I'll try to break it down bit by bit.

1. Language- language is simple with plain vocabulary including too many slangs and curse words. Do not expect it to be too ""phony"" with use of words. It's all plain which makes it bland. But considering the kind of narration that has been put to use, it is somewhat explainable. 

2. Character- All the story revolves around a single character. That single character is the antagonist as well as the protagonist. And all the character development occurs in the first few chapters of the book. No new information is revealed in the later half of the book. It just keeps on dragging the same traits of the character to the extent that it almost becomes nauseating by the end. And when a character is developed in that way it is expected to provide a resolution to the character. But the climax leaves the character hanging in midair, arguably, with same repulsive trait that he begins with.

3. Plot - nothing much in this department. No excitement. No twists. There were few opportunities where it could have developed into an interesting plot but it misses on them and decides to carry on with same monotony.

I would opine that it is an okay read and not a great read as it is hyped. Just because you are able to relate with character should not make a reason to rate a book on higher side. A good book would be one where even if you are not able to relate with the character, you feel him through yourself.",3,1584039955,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhlmc8/the_critique_in_the_rye/,books,1
fhld8j,lab52,I have a lot of questions on 1984 by George Orwell (spoilers),"I admit I read this book when I had down time at work so there was a lot of putting it down and picking it back up. So perhaps I missed a bunch of stuff while reading but I'm left with a lot of questions, maybe you guys can help what I must have missed.

1. It seemed like everyone in ""The Party"" had an awful life with being surveilled by the telescreen and the thought police yet it seemed like the ""proles"" had a normal life - they could be seen singing, wearing make-up, drinking, going to the pub, etc. with NO telescreens. Why was it just party members who had telescreens? Why did the party members appear to have worse lives than the proles?
2. How did Winston end up as a member of the party? If it was so awful why couldn't he join in with the life of the proles?
3. Mr. Charrington, the shop owner, had set Winston up?? was he in some kind of disguise? the part in the book where Winston is caught by the police, it sounded like MR Charrington like.. changed shape or something?
4. So basically O'Brien and Julia set Winston up? they knew that he was against the party so they went through the elaborate plan of setting him up ? and the whole scene with Winston and Julia in the field/away from people, was just to trap him?
5. O'Brien said he wrote Goldstein's book about ""the brotherhood"" - why? that whole part was lost on me....
6. Did Winston end up getting shot at the end?

fhiar0,Leolas3,The Why Cafe by John Strelecky (review),"The 2006's book 'The Why Cafe' written by John Strelecky is definitely one if the best books I ever had the honour to read.
Honestly, at first I was a little bit afraid to read it, since it deals with some big questions of life. But now that I think about it, it was definitely worth it.
Ever since I started this book, the story and questions just pulled me in and I've been catching myself asking questions all of the time.
The book's presentation of life is extremely appealing to me and just having in mind that my purpose is to do what I want to do gives me confidence.
Therefore, it's definitely not an exaggeration to say this book has changed my life.

I would recommend it to anyone struggling with finding a purpose (or at least a hint of it). 

In my opinion, not only the story speaks to one, but also the design of the whole book.
It's all over with drawings and the cover gives you a feeling like you are rather reading a children's book than one that asks difficult questions. And that also makes it easier to focus on the topic, I suppose. Since you don't feel like reading an intellectual's biography. 

The whole writing style is also very simple. The protagonist keeps asking why-questions. I suggest this is intended to make the reader understand the point of the staff's questions and answers.

Overall, the book seems to be more intended to interfere with the reader's thoughts than any other book I have read before. And I quite like that.

Obviously, it's your decision whether to read 'The Why Cafe' or not, but I highly doubt it would do any harm.",0,1584027812,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fhiar0/the_why_cafe_by_john_strelecky_review/,books,1

fhggch,dtab,I'm wondering if this happens to anyone else....,"I'm reading Valley Forge by Bob Drury and Tom Clavin. It's a good book, I'd highly recommend it. Interesting, especially for history buffs like myself. I'm not overly familiar with the material, so it's not as if I've read all this somewhere before. It's got good pacing, doesn't get bogged down in minutia. And yet for some strange reason, I feel as though I can't make any headway with it. I'll sit and knock off two or three chapters, but when I put my bookmark in, it looks as though I've barely made any progress at all. It's only average length, about 350 pages, but even though I've been working on it for a week I'm only 125 pages in. It's not a huge deal except that as a rule I like to read a book a week, and this thing is bringing down my average, and it shouldn't be because it's a good book!

fhdsle,otoko_no_hito,Enhancing the reading experience,"So this its a topic I would like to discuss to see how common of an occurrence this is, some times when I'm reading a novel, specially in particularly detailed scenes I stop ""seeing"" the written words and I start ""watching"" the scene as if it were a movie but in my imagination, sort of like daydreaming but I'm still reading and turning the pages with full understanding of what I'm reading, if a word gets confusing or the redaction gets weird it will break the ""dream"".

I've found this state its very similar to a deep meditative trance. 

At the beginning I was able to induce it by using electronic music while being in a completely relaxed state and having full focus on what was reading, eventually I became able to induce it mostly anywhere if I have some good headphones by practicing although that became somewhat dangerous as I basically start ignoring everything else around me without a good notion of time. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

fhdl8r,LightningSteps,Just started reading the second Witcher book (mild spoilers),"I just started reading the second Witcher book. I wasn't that surprised it started in medias res. After all, the first book jumped around quite a bit so it made sense.

There were some things that seemed like really big jumps, but I had no doubts that they'd all be covered in flashbacks and the like. For example, Ciri already knew some of the magic and had already undergone some training with Geralt. She was also already separated from him which surprised me the most I guess. It felt odd that the establishing moments of their relationship would be something left for some later part of the book.

A third of the way in I decided to check the Wikipedia for an alternate reading order. Not that I'd follow it, I like reading books in the publishing order trusting the author to know where and when everything goes, but I was curious. That is when I noticed the fact that *Time of Contempt*, the book I was currently reading was the second book of the Witcher **Saga**, not the second Witcher book overall. The book I should've been reading the whole time was *Sword of Destiny* - meaning I skipped two whole books, one of which was an entry into the series.

fhbkot,esquqred,Just can't seem to get into fiction. Would appreciate some advice.,"Although I'm an avid reader, 99% of what I read is non-fiction. Mainly science, history, philosophy, nutrition, and true crime. Every once in awhile I'll venture into the land of fiction, but I just can't seem to get into it. My latest attempt was some Franz Kafka, after watching a couple of videos about ""Metamorphosis"", and what makes something ""kafkaesque"". I enjoyed it well enough, but let's just say that I'm glad it was only as long as it is. It wasn't the bizzareness of the story; I enjoyed that. I guess it was his use of language. 

I tried reading the first book of Game of Thrones and couldn't keep all the names straight. I'd really like to get into fiction and do some escapism reading, but I just can't find something to enthrall me. There is one book of fiction I love, Alice in Wonderland, and I read that almost once a year. I just read a post here about The Stand and would like to give that go.

The police station scene where he got arrested was my favorite. 
 I loved the idea of Mercerism and the tech that built a new religion, I feel i would join it if i could.  

I liked how the androids aren't really redeemed at the end, we understand they are living beings but that they are nothing like humans.

fh9oct,pie640,Visualizing books as anime,"There are a lot of threads about visualizing books and how well people do it, whether as movies with perfect clarity or not at all, but I have to wonder if anyone imagines books in their head as anime. I'm not a huge anime obsessive, and can only say there are a handful of animes I really like, but the art style has been stuck in my head and provides the look of any work of literature I read. Even the voices I hear in my head reading dialogue are reminiscent of the voices I hear dubbing my favorite animes (yeah, I prefer dubs).    

I wonder if this is unethical. Many of the authors I read and admire, from Shakespeare through Jane Austen to Marcel Proust, lived before the age of anime. If they had known about anime would they have approved? I am even uncertain of the writers who are alive and aware of the medium, such as Thomas Pynchon, who I think references Pokemon in Bleeding Edge. (I know anime adaptations of classic literature is a thing, but an adaptation is different than what I'm talking about.)

So around Christmas I was at Barnes &amp; Noble browsing for some books. I picked up one and started reading a few pages.


It started with a boy being woken up by his mother and was taken to an older women for a test to see if he had some magical ability. The test required him to put his hand in a box and keep it there but his hand was burning with pain. If he pulled his hand out he would be killed, I believe, and the mother had to wait outside the room while this test was done. He passed and the mother came back in. 

This was within the first few pages and I decided to get the book but apparently I set it down to look for others.

fh59uu,ManySleeplessNights,On Lovecraft and why I'm beginning to develop a bad taste to his legacy and reputation.,"First post here.

Currently I'm reading a compilation of the works of HP Lovecraft. At first I was immediately immersed in his writing style and storylines, from the beginning of his saga of gods presiding over insanity in Dagon to more orthodox horror such as The Outsider or Herbert West, Reanimator. The Hound in particular. Something about his way of prose just seems poetic, almost baroque in a sense. I began to really enjoy reading his works.

An interest that hit a brick wall and fell to the ground with a splat after reading one story in particular.

The Rats in the walls.

On the cover this seems like something that will genuinely make you squirm and shiver. The idea of having any kind of animal in my walls makes me uncomfortable. But delving deeper, I found that Lovecraft was undeniably and unjustifiably racist.

The main character in the story has a cat with black fur. And Lovecraft genuinely went and named it N-word man. And it's not just a simple mention, oh no, he goes on to fully name it every time the cat is brought up. Almost like he's trying to shove it in your face.

I stopped reading for about a month before finally and reluctantly picking the book back up and soldiering my way through it. The story wasn't that bad content wise, but I'm just uncomfortable at how he can be so blatantly racist and get away with it in modern day. I'm honestly thinking of stopping reading his works altogether, the only reason I'm still reading on is that I want to see what made Cthulhu (and subsequently his dedicated story The Call of Cthulhu, I've also been told The Colour out of Space will also make the reader uncomfortable in a more cosmical horror based way) so significant in culture today.

This makes me think. Lovecraft lived in a time where racism was abound. Much of any racist remarks, and content from back then is today considered highly offensive, frowned upon and banned. Sure, famous books in history tackle themes of racism, such as Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird, but here Lovecraft is just shoving racist remarks in our faces. What is it that still allows his conspicuous racist statements to prevail through to this today?

From this my interest in him has dulled. I wonder what everyone else think about Lovecraft?",22,1583964099,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fh59uu/on_lovecraft_and_why_im_beginning_to_develop_a/,books,0

fh2l11,magnum_marilyn,The Power by Naomi Alderman,"The Power is one of those books that’s long and short at the same time. 

Quick plot synopsis before we begin: women around the world start growing skeins across their collarbones that allow them the power of electrocution. They can teach this “power”— aka reawaken the primordial organ— to other women. Over the course of 10 years, changes ensue. 

At about 350 pages of short chapters told from multiple perspectives, the story moves at an exponentially fast pace as it nears its conclusion. It’s exciting. It’s tantalizing. It’s a page turner. But then, BAM: you’re left with the simplest, most disappointing ending just sort of dropped into your lap. There is nothing that indicates this “sudden death” (as a general term, not literally) ending is done on purpose, either. It doesn’t smack you in the face the way some simple endings do. It just sort of pops up, asks you to accept it, and moves on in a way that makes you feel like the author had a looming deadline and needed to get to her next project. 

It’s a FASCINATING concept, too. The story itself was great. I mean there were lots of cliches, sure, but the characters were fun and the lore was interesting. It’s not a timeless classic or something but it was a great story about the concept of “oppressed becoming oppressors”. And that ending just made me feel like I was one of the people who spent their time watching the mountain in labor only to witness a mouse. 

There is no harm in cheap reads. They’re as important as any other kind of read. But it’s good to know what you’re getting into, and “The Power” is indeed a cheap read. Enjoy it! But don’t expect something mind-bending. 

TL/DR: meh. If you don’t mind disappointing endings definitely check it out. Good pool read.",7,1583954183,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fh2l11/the_power_by_naomi_alderman/,books,1

fh0abs,potatosmashinator300,I finished Diana Wynne Jones' The Moving Castle Series and here is my two cents,"It took me less than a week to finish the trilogy of *Howl's Moving Castle*, *Castle in The Air* and *House of Many Ways* and I'd like to share some thoughts and maybe a little review about it.   
I hope anyone reading this can find it helpful, before or after start reading her works. 

**What to expect in the stories**  
If you have seen Hayao Miyazaki's adaptation of *Howl's Moving Castle,* keep in mind that though the beginning of the two versions are the same, they lead up to totally different narratives, both are equally good.  
If you haven't seen the movie, please watch it. It won't spoil anything for you but might provide you with some visual inspiration since the stories mainly take place in Ingary, a fictional country which is quite similar to late 19th century Europe. Or maybe it's not because it was not very explicit in the books. 

*Howl's Moving Castle* introduces readers to the land of Ingary where there are witches and wizards and everyone is cool about it. The main characters in this book are Sophie and Howl and they will make appearance in the next two books. 

*Castle in The Air* was a wild ride from start to finish because I have the intelligence of a screwdriver. Somehow I thought Miyazaki's *Castle in The Sky* was the adaptation of this novel so when I found out that it's not, I got disappointed. Then,&gt;!not until the main character Abdullah has both a flying carpet and a genie in the bottle that!&lt; a light bulb went off in my head and I realized that the plot is based on Arabian Nights. Then, the story goes on and ties together with the first book and I got engaged again.

In *House of Many Ways,* our main character, Charmain Baker, is a major bookworm who can be relatable to many readers (I think). She tries to pursue her dream job while find herself in charge of tasks after tasks. There are also some updates of characters from the 1st and 2nd book, which I find quite charming. 

**Witty dialogue and marvelous story telling**   
I cannot believe that so far we only have one anime adaption of these books themselves can be regarded as screenplay. While reading, I can actually visualize a movie inside my head with the camera switching back and fort as the characters exchange ingenious conversation.  
Here is a part from *Castle in The Air* if anyone is interested*,* I marked it as spoiler but I don't think it gives away the story anyway:

&gt;&gt;!There was a dead silence. In fact, the silence was so very dead that Abdullah realized that the sixty ears \[...\] - no, sixty-eight ears \[...\] were at that moment focused entirely upon what he and Flower-in-the-Night were saying.
""Talk among yourselves!"" he shouted.
The silence became uneasy. It was broken by the elderly princess saying, ""The most distressing thing about being up here above the clouds is that there is no weather to make conversation out out of.""!&lt;

**Character development**  
I terribly love how none of the characters is a Mary Sue but every single one of them has flaws or appears to be imperfect in the eyes of others, and if the character has previously been portrayed as a bad guy, they still have a redeeming quality or some still choose to love them nevertheless.  
The author succeeded in painting realistic characters, however, she also pointed out that some traits are tolerable, some aren't &gt;!(for example, Howl keeps being a coward but Charmain chooses to be kind to Peter)!&lt;.

**The predestination theme in the series**  
I haven't seen anyone mentioned this before but this is what I take from reading the novels:  
Almost every character in every book has a curse or a prophecy of some sort &gt;!(Sophie believes she has the curse of the eldest child, Howl is cursed by The Wicked Witch of the Waste, both Abdullah and Flower-of-the-night have a prophecy, Princess of Strangia and Prince of Ingary's marriage proposal, Great Uncle William knew he will get sick in the future).!&lt; From the way I see it in other stories, such foretelling appear to be a bad omen. However, it does not have to. Even though some characters try to change their destiny, they can't; Yet by letting it fulfill, they can continue and steer their path into a better direction. 

**Final verdict**  
Emma Bull described Diana Wynne Jones as, and I quote: 

&gt;""the author of quantities of excellent books, all of which should be read by discriminating adults, on trains, with shameless enthusiasm and the occasional audible giggle.

I cannot wait to start reading other books from her and sincerely you do the same.",20,1583945634,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fh0abs/i_finished_diana_wynne_jones_the_moving_castle/,books,1

fgzn7d,dustbowlsoul2,"Just finished ""A Visit From the Goon Squad"" by Jennifer Egan and I'm floored","I just finished this book and needed to talk about it somewhere. What a book! I find it insane that words on a page could bring such strong melancholy and nostalgic feelings.

I normally shy away from books about ""the music industry"" or rockers or bands. There is always an air of coolness and name dropping and the like that grates on me. With that said, this wasn't a central part of this novel, which is I think a ""mosaic novel"", a bunch of short stories with the same characters and different perspectives working together to tell a central story. 

Some of these stories really stood out to me. I particularly liked the chapter ""Out of Body"" and how there was a confirmation of it a couple chapters later.

The book is really sad and beautiful. A lot of it is about aging and the things it does with time really messed with me.

One main complaint is the final story and &gt;!how it takes place in a near future and there is a bit of speculative sci-fi stuff there that was a little dated. Why do they think we will text like that? No one predicted emojis!!&lt;

 Other than that I really, really enjoyed it and I liked how lots of elements came full circle.",15,1583943289,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgzn7d/just_finished_a_visit_from_the_goon_squad_by/,books,1

As an example, a standout i enjoyed is *When Breath Becomes Air*.

Anyone want to talk about this book? I'm only a few pages in and I don't think spoiler alerts apply (it's about Trump, and a country that would elect him).. The satire is not subtle, you know what you are reading about within a couple of pages. I had a moment to think ""Was this written for children"" but a few more pages in and I think this will be a viable read, something that holds its own if we're talking satire. There is anger, and the simplistic tone made me think Eggers (like others) wakes up some days thinking we've all gone crazy.. We're discussing legal details about multiple infractions with an eye to technical accuracy when it all comes down to a loudmouth cheating con man and his gang of criminals.",1,1583936591,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgxx7d/the_captain_and_the_glory_dave_eggers/,books,1

From then on it was my intent to read his Jurassic novels to further advance my knowledge on the lore of the Jurassic Park Saga.

It seems to me that Crichton is not as popular as he should be. People might know Paulo Coelho, Dan Brown or Stephen King but they all go blank when I mention Crichton. Crichton wrote best-sellers such as *The Andromeda Strain*, *Sphere* and *Jurassic Park*. His Jurassic Park film adaptations alone has grossed more than what all of King's film adaptations grossed altogether, let alone his other film adaptations. Crichton created the hit and culturally-significant television drama *E.R.*. The guy even got two dinosaurs named after him. Crichton also directed the cult-classic *Westworld* which spawned a hit HBO series recently.

I don't remember much else other than the dad was kidnapped by ivory poachers who were forcing him to help them track the elephants. That and one part where the kids bike gets stolen and he finds it and just steals it back. I don't really remember much about the story but I remember loving it and reading it numerous times.

Honestly I wished the author had divided this in at least two books. There is simply **too much** being covered in this tome... and apparently the second book (already put on hold in my library) is **even longer**.

If someone tried to adapt this to a TV series this would be one of those strange cases where a single tome less than 700 pages long could potentially last for more than two seasons.

The factions and characters at the end of the book simply don’t resemble what we started with at all.

And while I like epic fantasy, I feel like the pacing has been all over the place which is how we get such a long epic delivered in what seems like a short book considering the amount of important events and characters in the story.

I should be done with it tomorrow. Hopefully the finale is awesome enough to justify the 20+ hours sinked into this epic novel.",0,1583896580,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgqlej/about_done_with_this_months_book_club_selection/,books,1

fgpq89,jeansoule,Reading Camus “The Plague” during a World Outbreak of Covid-19,"
I read and finished The Plague recently, with the recent events that plague everyone and their mother’s social timeline, I thought it’d be apt. The parallels between reality and fiction are bountiful, I sat there in complete awe as the words in a book written almost a century ago resemble the now. I would like to share some of my thoughts and maybe even persuade you to read it, let’s begin. 

You are introduced to Dr. Rieux in the first sentence when he walks out into the street after seeing a patient, he encounters a dead rat as he leaves, and thus we begin. The outbreak is centered in a town called Oran in Algeria. People begin to have symptoms of the bubonic plague; days pass and people do not seek medical attention. The government refuses to acknowledge any sort of outbreak and newspapers downplay the severity of the oncoming outbreak with drastically reduced cases. Eventually the governments hand is forced from an uproar from the public but continue to drag their feet. People no longer go out and daily life is disrupted and people have more time on their hands than they know what to do with. The death toll is reverberated throughout the streets daily by speaker announcements, the town becomes a former shell of itself. 

We are slowly introduced to a cast of characters throughout the first part of the novel that are vital to the theme. Each of these characters are unique in the way they deal with the calamity that abruptly comes upon the town. We have the journalist Rambert, who is unlucky enough to only be visiting the town when the plague strikes and also ironically there to report on the health of the general public of Oran, thus leaving him stranded in the town as the government finally closes down docks and roads preventing any further spread. He panics as he feels isolated and separated from loved ones back home, he is not part of Oran. He seeks escape. Rambert signifies cowardice in time of communal strife. Then we have Father Paneloux, he is the local priest of Oran. He continues to hold mass even with the spread of disease, in his sermons he states that the plague was brought upon the people of Oran for their sins! That you have nothing to fear if you do right by God. Paneloux represents the seeking of solace and religion in times of collective calamity. Finally we have Dr.Rieux, a man who uses all his resources in trying to stop the plague. He believes Paneloux to be simply an ignorant fool who has not even seen how horrible the deaths are first hand and Rambert who simply just wants to be reunited with his lover back in France justified in his action of escape. When Rambert finally has a means of escape the next day he visits The Dr. and his colleague to announce his departure, all farewells and condolences are said, then Rieux’s colleague pulls Rambert to the side and informs him that Rieux also has a lover who is in another country far away, at that moment something clicked in Rambert. The next day Rambert does not get on the boat to escape and decides to join the health forces created by Rieux and his colleagues. Rieux signifies hope.

This was only the peak of how philosophical this novel can be. I just can’t be bothered to write more. If this write up interested you at all, I would totally recommend a read. I only went over a few major characters and the first half of the novel, there is much much more.

Not even the most astonishingly influential properties in my life (Lord of The Rings, A Song of Ice And Fire, The Witcher), caught my interest while reading. This was bothering me, since I did want to get into the habit of reading, and I thought starting with those would help. This issue recently solved itself as I picked up a few biographies from a discount store in my area, and I found myself enthralled with the stories of real people. I'm starting to truly believe non-fiction is my preferred way of reading. I am deep into the biography of Frederick Douglass, and his life has so far left me entertained moreso than the adventures of Geralt of Rivia or Frodo Baggins.

fgn6qg,korenbloemen,Currently reading Salammbô (1862) by Gustave Flaubert,"I stumbled upon this book more or less by accident through a wikipedia deepdive, and its premise had me hooked immediately: It's a historic novel set in and around Carthage after the First Punic War, where its mercenaries are revolting against the city for lack of payment. At the same time, the sacred veil of Tanit (the city's protection goddess) is stolen, without which the city will be doomed to fall.

It has great pacing, interesting characters, and *a lot* of purple prose and opulence, which are things I always love in books. (A lot better than the so-called Dutch literature I was required to read in high school.)   
The story however is also quite morbid, containing a lot of violence and cruelty and showing the ugliest side of the human psyche. These are things I sometimes like as well, as long as it's not trying to justify this or be pretentious about it. The combination of these two reminds me a lot of Oscar Wilde's ""Salomé"".   
One huge turnoff in the book is the quite racist literature with which black people are denoted. The mercenary army consists of all kinds of different peoples which are painstakingly named s.a. Greeks, Tunisians, Balearics, Spartans, etc. but black mercenaries are simply called the n-word. They're also barely mentioned up to where I am now. It's making me uncomfortable, but I'm trying to see it as a byproduct of the time the book was written in.

What do you guys think? Is violence a turnoff in historic literature, or sometimes a necessary element? Do you like purple prose? Should racist language in classic literature be seen as a product of its time, or should it be a red flag for reading?",14,1583882217,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgn6qg/currently_reading_salammbô_1862_by_gustave/,books,1

fgmtsa,jonaxo,LGBTQ+ book recommendations?,"Hi all!

Im currently in my mid twenties and love reading almost anything LGBT focused as it kinda feels like nothing like that was around when I was in high school so I went where most of us went, fan fiction!

To maybe narrow down the recommendations here here are things I already like! (tropes, books, styles)

Being a male gay I like getting to relate to male gay characters. 

For books it feels like I’ve read a lot of the popular LGBT YA books.

Captive Prince Series (a lot, loved the writing style, loved the tension, loved seeing it from both sides)

Carry On/Wayward Son (easier read but again great character development and tension) 

I’ll give you the sun (was alright!)

red, white, &amp; royal blue (amazing, so amazing. Writing style was amazing)

Currently about to start we contain multitudes.

I like reading YA a lot. Anyway, please feel free to recommend anything you’re reading and are loving or obsessed with, can’t wait! ♥️",2,1583880810,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgmtsa/lgbtq_book_recommendations/,books,1
fgmjej,Thunderwearr,Purge all my books???,"So my story is that growing up I loved to read. I was always checking out books from the library and read a good bit each month. Life happened and I got away from reading for a long while. 

About 5 years ago I was looking for book suggestions and found BookTube. I then purchased a ton of books they suggested. I had over 300 books in the matter of a few years. 

Fast forward to last year and I moved from a 4 bedroom house to a 1 bedroom apartment. I went through several purges of books I lost interest in and got my books down to about 120 physical copies. (Of the 120 I’ve read about 20) Now I’ve started several of the books off my shelves and couldn’t finish them. I got bored and wanted to start a new one. I think my reading tastes may have changed (Did I have a reading taste or did I just buy the books the BookTubers suggested? 🤔) 

Anywho I think I’m in the biggest slump ever. I can’t find a book I want to read. I must have DNFed about 6 books over the last month. 

I think I should do another book purge and keep the ones I am really interested in now? Or maybe do a TBR jar? Or stop buying books and use my library more? But then what about the ones I own???

Sorry for this long post! I don’t know what to do. Any suggestions are welcomed! 😊",19,1583879732,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgmjej/purge_all_my_books/,books,1
fgmhq0,abgemacht,I just finished Jurassic Park and was blown away,"I grew up loving (and still do) the movie Jurassic Park.  I've watched it so many times I never thought it was worth reading.  Well I had a hankering to watch it again and saw it was on sale on Audible, so I figured why not ""read"" it instead.

I absolutely loved it.  The book had all the excitement of the movie but so much more depth as well.  I was impressed with how easily the story could switch between cerebral discussions and dinosaurs ripping people apart.  The commentary on biotechnology, industry vs academia, and problems with over reliance on automation were all excellent.  With the exception of a few specific details, which were understandably outdated, it was hard to believe the story was 30+ years old.

As an aside, Scott Brick's narration was superb.

As a keen hiker myself, the non-supernatural details of their trip feel authentic, and surely must be influenced by Tolkien's own hiking experiences and love for the English countryside.

This got me thinking about other fictional walks. A lot seem to be just plot devices to get the character's from point a to point b. There are exceptions like RLS's *Kidnapped*, where the incidents on David's trek are an integral part of the story. There must be others though, so if anyone can suggest novels where there is a hike that comes across as interesting and realistic, I would be very keen to hear about them.",2,1583878389,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgm6b3/great_fictional_hikes/,books,1

It doesn’t go into detail about his early life or about what his parents did or the history of his hometown. It goes straight to the point the presidency. I understand why certain biographies go into detail about the early life of the president but it is not always the most critical to understanding Eisenhower or any other person of interest.

fglwkp,leowr,"French authors that aren't named Alexandre Dumas, Albert Camus or Victor Hugo","Disclaimer: There is nothing wrong with books by Alexandre Dumas, Albert Camus and Victor Hugo. You should definitely read them, but everybody knows about them already. So lets talk about some other French authors.

France has a long and varied literary history, with authors from different backgrounds, points of view and life experiences. I'm far from an expert with regard to French literature, but I always feel that French authors have a way with words that shines through even in translation. It seems to me that a lot of French authors write about topics that others might not be as open about, even in the written format. 

Some of my favorite books by French authors that aren't named Alexandre Dumas, Albert Camus or Victor Hugo:

[Gigi and the Cat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275350.Gigi_and_The_Cat) by Colette: This is actually a collection of the novella *Gigi* and a short story, called *The Cat.* Gigi is probably the more well-known of the two (it was turned into a film and a stage play, which was Audrey Hepburn's Broadway debut). Gigi is about a young girl that is being educated to become a Courtesan. While I enjoyed Gigi, I have to say that I loved *The Cat. The Cat* is about a young man who is about to be married and leave his parental home. However, he simply can't leave his cat behind, which he loves. So the cat joins the newlyweds in their new home, but the home doesn't end up being blissful as it is expected to be. 

[The Perfect Nanny](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38330854-the-perfect-nanny) (aka Lullaby) by Leïla Slimani: This book got quite a bit of attention a couple of years ago. The book is about a family of four, Myriam and Paul and their children Mila and Adam, who invite a fifth person into their circle. Myriam wants to return to work, so Louise comes in to take care of the children and the household. This book is not so much about what happens, Slimani tells you what happens right at the start. Rather is it about why it happens. You follow a slow journey in which relationships change and unravel, all the while knowing how these changes culminate in tragic events.

[33 Days: A Memoir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22716571-33-days) by Léon Werth: Léon Werth was encouraged by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, one of his friends, to write this memoir of the days he spent fleeing from Paris in advance of the Nazi's occupation of the city. de Saint-Exupéry (this name should sound familiar btw) proceeded to smuggle the manuscript out of France, wrote an introduction and left it in New York to be published, which unfortunately didn't end up happening until 1992. With regard to the book itself, Werth does a great job of getting the chaos and uncertainty across of fleeing your home and leaving everything behind, while everyone around you does the same. He shows how people respond to these new circumstances they find them in and how they respond to the presence of the Nazi's in their country. Sidenote: the English translation is printed by The Melville House for their [Neversink Library series](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/25224.Neversink_Library), which I think contains quite a few titles that look appealing.)

Bonus mention: I haven't read any of her books, but I recently read some short stories by Francoise Sagan (in particular The Gigolo, The Unknown Visitor, The Lake of Loneliness and In Extremis), which made me extremely interested in reading some of her longer works. 

What are some of your favorite French authors (that aren't named Alexandre Dumas, Albert Camus or Victor Hugo)?  If you have read the books that I mentioned what did you think of them? What do you think of French literature in general?

fgka71,lisoemperio,Finally Finished Don Quixote and it was something that I will remember forever. A must read,"It is regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature ever, but it's a lot more than that. If you read the proper full version of it without any cuts or anything, then you will see the deep philosophy of Don Quixote.
He wasn't just a madman or crazy person, the words he used, the knowledge he had, his view of the world and his ideologies which he shared with others made makes him one of the most well written characters. 
Miguel de Cervantes has written an epic story of a man who become so delusional with something he loves that he isn't able to tell difference between reality and fantasy of his mind, but is a most sensible person in his illness and how some people who try to amuse themselves with him act more crazy than him. Each and every interaction that he had was a memorable one, from being beaten and pelted with stones to saving convicts and eating with dukes.
But most admirable part of Don Quixote is his philosophy and thinking process which is rare to find even in these days. In the entirety of the novel all are suprised of how at one moment he talks like a madman and at others a great priest or preacher.
I know that I might be able to tell whats so good about Don Quixote but those who are looking for a good read that keeps them satisfied for a long time this is a must. You will earn a new respect for yourself if you read it completely.

fgk4bk,trinitytroll,"Thoughts on Yoko Ogawa's ""The Memory Police""? [Spoilers]","So I just finished this book, and though I'm not 100% sure I understood all of the metaphor in it, I really liked it. I think having read Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart before this put me in a good mindset to enjoy this story.

I picked up on the theme that those who are oppressed can't protect themselves against its effects. R believes that by keeping the disappeared objects, he can counteract the disappearances, but the protagonist (subconsciously) understands that in her world/society, she cannot control anything. Even her own heart and mind belong to the memory police.

The story she writes reflects her situation - neither character can prevent outside forces from robbing them of their very self. I wondered if the act of typing as a means on stealing the voice in the story was meant to mirror how the protagonist's focus on protecting R/fitting in/her jobs allows her to passively watch everything around her disappear.

I also wondered if all the talk about distance between the protagonist and R were to suggest that love can't exist in a oppressed world - no matter how hard the characters try, they are forced into loneliness by the circumstances of the society. The holes in their hearts represent this - people protect themselves from the pain of loss by denying attachment to anything. That's why the disappearances don't seem to affect them.

R's hidden room I thought was a metaphor for how the citizens compartmentalize themselves to survive. Attachment, emotions etc are pushed deep inside themselves (the swamp of the mind) and are only visited in quiet moments, away from the fear of the memory police.

There are a few things Im not sure I understand though. What did the drugged tea in the memory police office mean? Does the earthquake symbolise anything?

I'd also love to hear about the other ways people read/interpreted this book. I really enjoyed it and i imagine I'll be thinking about it for a while.",4,1583870895,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgk4bk/thoughts_on_yoko_ogawas_the_memory_police_spoilers/,books,1

fgiihh,Marlalarlowe,I don't visualise characters when reading - and apparently this isn't normal?,"So I just found out that me not visualising characters when reading or their surroundings is unusual (in my poll of 5 people including my SO). I hadn't really thought about it before and was wondering if others do it too?

I take in the information, but instead of physically manifesting what they'd look like, instead for me it creates a feeling of their character. I feel like I know them rather than see them if that makes sense? Like how in the dark you'd instantly just know your SO from what they feel like next to you. 

I do the same with surroundings and places in books. I feel like I know what it's like to be there for the character, but I don't visualise it. 

It's why I don't particularly care when a book is adapted to a film or TV series and people complain the person doesn't look like the character. Instead for me it's the feeling I get when I watch them and how the character's personality/flaws/feelings come out. 

The best instance of this I can think of for me personally is Jane Eyre - the 2011 Mia Wasikowska version vs 2006 Ruth Wilson version. In my opinion although I know Mia physically is much more akin to what's stated in the book, Ruth far outshines her in capturing that restrained passion. 

I love reading, and I especially love books where I feel like I'm inside of the character feeling and seeing things the way they do.",70,1583865107,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgiihh/i_dont_visualise_characters_when_reading_and/,books,1

I read this book once before, back in the late 80s or early 90s, and it has always stayed with me, but I think I forgot, or possibly failed to realize what a good book it really is.

It's the sequel to The Peace War, but I feel that it can stand on its own, as the issues and people are fairly universal.

One thing that really strikes me, rereading it now, is how beautifully it has aged. A male author wrote this in the late 80s, and managed to write all of his female characters as human beings, even when at least two of them were essentially super-beings.

There is a lesbian couple in the book, and it is a measure of how ahead of his time Vinge was that they were married. And even though I lived in a very lesbian-rich environment when I first read it, and knew many gay couples, I was still thrown by the fact that the two married characters had the same last name. Because that just wasn't on the radar then. We were still trying to get people to use condoms, and not make AIDS jokes.

Anyway, it's an excellent read, both thoughtful, and interesting. It's a post-apocalyptic book without an actual apocalypse. It's a murder mystery, and a very genuine science fiction novel.

I am currently reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and I have a question for anyone interested.  
What is Lenina's eye color?

I'm asking this question because in one paragraph her eyes are described as blue (page 173), while on two other occasions (as far as i've read - page 186 currently) her eyes are described as purple.

Context:

Page 16 - Lenina is introduced.  
""The girl turned with a start. One could see that, for all the lupus and the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty.""

Page 173 - Lenina at a party  
""Lenina alone said nothing. Pale, her blue eyes clouded with an unwonted melancholy...""

Page 186 - Lenina after work  
""Henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes...""

fgd5v4,challenjd,A Reading Summary (six-ish years in review),"Data here: [https://imgur.com/a/22qTPx6](https://imgur.com/a/22qTPx6)

I've [posted here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/8rfyrh/a_reading_summary_four_years_in_review/), but the overall story is that I am trying to get through a long list of books (nominally based off of [Daniel S. Burt's list](https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/Daniel+S.+Burt%27s+Novel+100) but with another 200 books or so added - including some plays and non-fiction). I am not a fast reader, but I am dedicated.

In 2018 and 2019 I read 14 and 12 books, respectively, which is very good for me. I have many hobbies, a full-time (plus some) job, and am a single dad. I squeeze it in. I have finished 6 so far this year, but one of those was mostly in December and the rest were shorter. 

My favorites continue to be Anna Karenina, Beloved, Siddhartha, and I have recently added Lolita. I imagine that will get some people on r/books spun up, but I think it was a fascinating read. Also sure to spin you all up: Moby Dick continues to be my least favorite. I appreciate the theme, but it was a painful read for me. I probably learned more about what I like and dislike about reading from that novel than from any other. I recently finished Ulysses, and I liked it, but I liken it to abstract art for literature... you're not definitely going to like it... and you won't just 'get it.' I don't 'get' Jackson Pollack either, but I like James Joyce more.

So here are some observations:

* My ratings have largely converged into a relatively narrow range - very few books are outside of my 5.5-8 range. I think this is because I am comparing them with books I have already read, and trying to squeeze them into an order (least-&gt;most favorite)
* I read almost exclusively in winter: I read 1.4 books/month from Nov-Jan, and 0.4/month April-Oct.
* I like books with a plot - I read for stories, not for appreciating the art of writing. I get bored easily, which may be partially because I read mostly right before bed. It's easy to fall asleep.

I have enjoyed doing this - it gives me something to do instead of browsing the interwebs, and I feel like I am enriching myself as a human being. I write a one-page write-up of each books I read as a summary, noting themes, and my impressions - forcing myself to sit and think about each book for a few minutes is helpful. And since I have a bad memory, that's a good reference.

Hopefully this is interesting to someone out there.",11,1583843912,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fgd5v4/a_reading_summary_sixish_years_in_review/,books,1

So why is Instagram popularizing fantasy so much? Is it simply the Instagram-worthy covers? If so, then isn't bookstagram ultimately skewing sales by hyping books that have less literary merit?

fga64c,andresm79,The Stand is a character development masterpiece (No Spoilers),"My First Stephen King Novel. The Stand is just simply amazing

&amp;#x200B;

One of the best books regarding character development. I guess 90% of the appeal in this book comes to it's characters, not because they are likable (I wouldn't be surprised if some people hated the majority of them) but because they feel very real. I was amazed with the amount of detail SK put into the characters, I've read non-fiction books with characters with less convincing backgrounds than what the The Stand gives.

&amp;#x200B;

The story is for it's majority really well thought and the plot twists kept me intrigued and in the middle of the book the story takes an 180 turn when it comes it's nature, although I was scared that it might ruin the build up and the quality of the story, the execution was brilliant. All the significant details, symbolism and character development come together in such an eulogy to what good writing is about. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not a a perfect book (there will never be one) and the main critique I have is some chapters are boring (but necessary to understand the story). Every book has weak spots but with The Stand they could drag for about 100 pages or so and since it is a really long novel so you have to be patient.

&amp;#x200B;

My other critique is that the book is really overwhelming at the beginning, there are a lot of characters being introduced at the same time, a lot of stuff happening at the same time and it might put you off from the beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

I read the Uncut version since I wanted to challenge myself by reading a long novel, but it is not for everyone. There is a lot to absorb about this universe and If you don't have the patience to watch the story slowly unfold, watch the characters reveal themselves and you're more of a point A to point B reader than you will probably won't like the book.

&amp;#x200B;

This book was more about the journey than the ending itself and it sure was an enjoyable one.",19,1583825872,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fga64c/the_stand_is_a_character_development_masterpiece/,books,1

First of all, I relate to her books so much. The cultures she satirizes I have experienced (with the exception of Mislaid) and know exactly the things she is referencing so perhaps that’s why I am so taken by her. Second, I think she is a hilarious genius. And third, I find her as a human to be unbelievably fascinating and mysterious and badass?! I am honestly so curious about her life. She seems so cool.

The way she describes euro expat culture in The Wallcreeper, or leftist squatters in Nicotine. So good. I just finished Doxology, which also was good, but found it less funny as it felt so relevant to the current political moment—but I still enjoyed it, just in a different way. Mislaid probably felt the most foreign to me, but still clever and wild to read.

But I also have a very specific life experience and I get the feeling that I share some similar experiences (just a presumptions based on what she writes about and the minimal knowledge I have about her life) and I also have a weird/dark sense of humour, so perhaps my intense love of her writing is subjective.

fg4u4f,BlavikenButcher,[Review] The Housekeeper and the professor,"The Housekeeper and the Professor is a love letter to making connections and math. This beautiful novel explores how people form attachments and how relationships beginning, evolve, and end. We see the relationship from The Housekeepers perspective, which is one that we are familiar with where we learn more and more about each other to form attachments. The relationship from The Professors perspective is always fresh and new due to his inability to form new memories. This contrast provides some real insight into human attachment and how we form opinions of ourselves. The elegance and patience that Yoko Ogawa takes to examine these perspectives is captivating. 

I was also riveted by the way that the math that permeates the novel is treated. The way the Professor looks at and explains math made me finally appreciate when people say that math is beautiful and elegant. There are many equations and concepts sprinkled throughout and all are treated with reverence.

This is the second work by Yoko Ogawa that I have read and will certainly not be the last. Her prose is gracefully written and shows a patience to explore her chosen subjects.",4,1583799385,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fg4u4f/review_the_housekeeper_and_the_professor/,books,1

fg4iv1,Sansophia,Looking for terms of Literary Analysis,"I'm not trying to start a debate right now, but to try and research what I believe about fiction and perhaps uncover WHY I believe them. 

1. Is there a term for a belief that the point of fiction is to present truths, and these truths may or may not be by the conscious effort of the writer? In fact, some of the most profound truths in fiction were not the intent of the author.

2, Is there a term for a belief that fictional worlds have a logic all their own which even the author is powerless to change unless they completely derail whatever power the story has? The best example off the top of my head is Lucas' ideas for both the Whills (Force feeders) and the midichlorians in Star Wars, although one was never implemented and the other doesn't quite break the story, though it comes VERY close.

3. Is there a term for believing that while fictional worlds don't exist, they represent worlds and people that COULD exist at least the good ones, and thus the author cannot do whatever the hell they please? This might be the same thing as 2, but maybe not quite/

4. Is there a term for the belief that an author can flat out be WRONG about details of the world they have ""created""? It's not Death of the Author, because that's about interpretation, but rather something more like the author creates a plot hole everyone sees, and there's something lacking or misplaced in the worldbuilding that by its nature must be changed for the work to make sense? In this case, there IS a correct interpretation but it's not the author's or not totaly the authors. 

5. In the philosophy of Philistinism, I have come to believe that that are actually three orders of Philistines, not just the one that simply depside art as a waste of time. 


The second is the one that actively participates in art but undervalues it. This is the type who says ""It's just a game/movie/book/story"" despite being a nominal fan. The type of person who regards everything as an evening's entertainment rather than a touchstone of universal truths. 


Then there are the third order, ""creators"" who see the work as merely self-expression, a vehicle for financial gain, or propounding ideological vision, The ""repurposers"" of Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, and even Michael Bay, who are so hated by their fandoms are the chief example in our time, but I'd argue that even Robert Heinlein was this kind of third-order philistine, and his works, especially Starship Troopers are hobbled by them being expressions of ideology rather than examinations thereof.
 

These stories do not have an existence of their own, nor do the characters, they are not organic nor developed organically, but only serve the whims and visions of the authors. They are tools of expression and do not exist for their own sake and on their own terms. 

I admit this thought might be underdeveloped so being able to read the thoughts of those who have given this concept thought would do well on me. Are there links I might make use of, even if it to disabuse me of this thinking?

6. Tvtropes has a page called I Just Write the Thing.
https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWriteTheThing

I'd like to look into this concept more, but because there's no academic term give, just buffyspeak, Google is not my friend here. I image this might be a whole school of thought given how many writers say this and believe it, but I'd need terms to investigate further.",0,1583798078,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fg4iv1/looking_for_terms_of_literary_analysis/,books,1

ffw72k,BlavikenButcher,[Review] The Institute by Stephen King.,"I never categorize myself as a Stephen King fan, in fact I did have a period of book snobbery where I poo pooed him, but I have read and enjoyed many of his works. The Institure is the first of his books I have read since 2013's Doctor Sleep and it is a great reminder that many of the trends of 80s style fiction we are experiencing lead straight back to Mr. King (and Spielberg).

The Institute gave me a similar feel to IT as it features a strong cast of young protagonists, I found Luke Ellis to be engaging but it is Avery Dixon that really steals the show for me, facing off against a big bad but still feels new and original.   The writing as is standard for a king novel is tight and propels the reader at a pace that makes it hard to put the book down. 

I assume most King fans do not need me to sell them on this book but I think The Institute has a lot of cross over appeal, especially anyone into Science Fiction particularly Stranger Things or the X-Files.",17,1583767071,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ffw72k/review_the_institute_by_stephen_king/,books,1

I only started with the book, but I have a strong impression that Charlie is a perfect guy with a perfect family and perfect friends especially compared to everything that was going on in my teens. And I'll give you some examples of that.

First, when he encounters a bully for the first time, he easily beats him up, because he obviously knows how to fight. He has a brother who is in the process of becoming a future football star, and who taught him all these punches and kicks so now Charlie can stand for himself. I was a coward in bad physical shape who didn't know anything about fights. I would lose to anybody in my school and people bullied me all the time. Nothing changed since then, except that in adult life nobody cares about anybody, so bullies disappeared just because I don't need to go to school anymore. 

Charlie's family would watch a tv show together and cry at the end, can you imagine it? I never had such experience with my family. But my father regularly reminded me that I'm a weak stupid coward who hasn't achieved anything in his life.

He's already got supportive friends who can give him life advice and with whom he can hang out.  I didn't have any friends at school and barely have any nowadays.

He doesn't look at porn pictures because he just doesn't like doing it. You guessed it, I have a porn addiction that I developed in my teens, and I still struggle with overcoming it.

I'm a whining idiot, I hope everyone already understands that by reading my post. But more than that, now I'm reminded by this book that my school life was just a piece of shit, and, no surprise, it still is. I know that my problems aren't unique, but it doesn't excuse the fact that I could do a lot better when I was younger. 

I hate myself and I hate my life.",12,1583764667,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ffvlqw/it_hurts_to_read_the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower/,books,1

I used to be really into reading as a teen but as I've gotten older (24), books just give me more and more anxiety. Specifically books where there's a super strong romance going and I feel invested into the relationship because it's written so beautifully. I've tried so hard to get back into reading but recently I tried and I've had severe anxiety for a week, unable to sleep because the ending was horrible between the two main characters lol. It's like my brain thinks \*I'm\* going through what the characters are and reacts accordingly. It makes it impossible to read a book without triggering anxiety. I just want to read, man!

So I guess I'd like to ask if anyone else finds that they experience this? How do you cope? Do you stick with a certain genre to avoid the anxiety?

ffsj8p,PreviousTea,Woolf - To The Lighthouse: Help me understand a sentence,"I just started reading \*To The Lighthouse,\* and I can't make sense of the sentence in bold: 

&amp;#x200B;

 \&gt; Since he belonged, even at the age of six, to that great clan which cannot keep this feeling separate from that, but must let future prospects, with their joys and sorrow, cloud what is actually at hand, since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests, James Ramsay, sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the Army and Navy stores, endowed the picture of a refrigerator, as his mother spoke, with heavenly bliss. It was fringed with joy. \*\*The wheelbarrow, the lawnmower, the sound of poplar trees, leaves whitening before rain, rooks cawing, brooms knocking, dresses rustling--all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language, though he appeared the image of severity, with his high forehead and fierce blue eyes, impeccably candid and pure, frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty . . . .\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

The first two sentences make enough sense: James Ramsay has just gotten good news from his mother about tomorrow, and since he's of the 'great clan' Woolf describes, he let's the joy of future prospects bleed into his present experience of cutting the catalog. (But: Woolf blends (a) inability to keep emotions separate, (b) letting future prospects color present experience, and (c) one or both of these processes resulting in the crystallization of a moment, the cementing into memory. (b) implies (a), but otherwise these three things seem pretty independent to me.) 

&amp;#x200B;

But then what does the next sentence mean? At first, I thought it might be describing other things he is experiencing at the moment, that his endowing the present moment with this joy borrowed from the future brought all these elements into sharper focus, gave them as much significance as the photo of the refrigerator. But then why say they were 'so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code, his secret language'? What does that mean? If these elements of his experience gain significance via joy borrowed from the future, it's not \*linguistic\* significance. I mean, Woolf can't expect us to believe that the wheelbarrow signifies something different than the lawnmower, and that these elements of experience could be used to \*communicate\* or anything like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean it's wrong to interpret the first part of the sentence as being about endowing elements of the current experience with something extra a la the picture of the fridge? (After all, it doesn't seem very true to experience. I agree that feeling excited or hopeful or anxious about the future colors the present moment, but it doesn't make me more aware of details in my environment like the ones Woolf lists. If anything, it makes me less aware because my mind's not there--it's off thinking about the future.) Or is there some way to keep that interpretation but fit it with this weird comment about secret languages? (Am I the only one that finds the ""kids having secret languages trope"" unconvincing and annoying?) 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, the next part of the sentence starts with 'though'--it's supposed to draw a contrast. But what's the contrast supposed to be between having a secret language and being severe? I really can't think of any relevant contrast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate some help understanding this sentence. It feels bad to be stumped so early in the novel.",12,1583748997,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ffsj8p/woolf_to_the_lighthouse_help_me_understand_a/,books,1
ffshsk,Gobanilobar,I think my education tainted my perception of women writers,"I was looking at my shelves and feeling a bit too pleased with my collection: 700 books in beautiful shelves, organized chronologically; as I run my fingers along the spines of my books, it feels like my fingers are tracing the leaves of time. I really like that. I read all these books (I keep my reference books and books didn't read in my office), and they tell as much about the history of literature and ideas as about my own.

&amp;#x200B;

Amidst all that self-satisfaction, I noticed that I only own five books written by women:

&amp;#x200B;

*Sappho* \- Sappho

*Obras Completas* \- Juana Inés de la Cruz

*The Tale of Genji* \- Murasaki Shikibu

*The Waves* \- Virginia Woolf

 *The Origins of Totalitarianism* \- Hannah Arendt

&amp;#x200B;

I read other women, of course, but I never decided, for whatever reason, to add those authors to my collection. I wonder if my education has something to do with that.

&amp;#x200B;

I went to all-boys boarding school and that means I had very little contact with women until college. I studied agronomic engineering and played rugby in college, so the contact with women was still very limited. I'm also gay and the little social life I had was spent with other guys in bars that only men frequented. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm quite aloof as it is, but I can't help thinking that my education molded the way I relate to women and the way I read. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you have similar experiences?

Claudia Gray wrote this book. She is most known for writing the Evernight series. This five-book vampire based romantic fantasy received high praise within the community. She receives credit for her originality within the Romantic fantasy genre.


The audiobook narrator is Sakia Maarleveld. She has narrated books such as The Alice Network by Kate Quinn, Bay of Sighs and Island of Glass by Nora Roberts, and Dooku: Jedi Lost by Cavan Scott.


The book begins with Leia preparing for the Royal Alderaanian ceremony called Day of Demand. This day is a ceremony where the heir to the throne would make their claim. The event is to take place on the 16th name day of the demander. The air was required to State their challenge of the body, mind, and heart. Her body challenge required her to climb a tall mountain, while her mind challenged obliged her to represent her world in the Apprentice Legislator. Her final and most crucial challenge required her to conduct charitable missions on planets in need. The purposes of these challenges were to make her become a worthy leader. The bulk of the story focuses on her heart challenge.

During her first challenge, Leia makes a blunder by trying to accomplish things on her own. The results of her actions cause pain to a great multitude. While her actions were rash, and in the long run, dangerous, it helped shape her political prowess by exploiting loopholes. 

She also grows in her political understanding while negotiating with a proud leader on a different planet. 

These heart challenges are used as a way to push character development. The author does an excellent job of turning Leia from a naive, immature little girl into a politically-minded woman. The most exceptional example of this occurs when Leia and her family deal with a high-ranking general. Leia used her young age to her advantage. By acting like an immature teenager, she can protect her family. 


Main takeaways:

This book is an excellent book for hardcore fans of the original trilogy.

This book documents Leia's maturity and growth in political situations.

This book presents a reasonable amount of backstory and dialogue between Leia and other critical characters.

However, the title has totally escaped my mind. I remember the plot though and would love some help on remembering. 

Potential spoilers ahead I guess. 

The book is about these two young brothers who's mom disappears (just doesn't come home one night) and they start helping their older neighbor with chores and stuff while their mom is gone. Neighbour, after a while, decides to take the boys on a camping trip to her summer lake cabin as a sort of reward for them. 

She instead straight up kidnaps them and makes them live at the cabin with her, helping her renovate/fix the cabin and stuff like that. 

They are there for a long time and eventually make it back to their city with the help of a neighbour of the cabin and find out that their mom was hit by a car and broke her leg(s) and was in the hospital.

fflprx,3kool5you,(Spoilers) Just finished Bram Stoker's Dracula...Questions!,"I see that this book is actually discussed pretty often on Reddit which is pretty cool, and a lot of people had the same thoughts as myself: Those being that the first third of the book at the castle is the best, and it slows down at parts.

That being said, I really enjoyed the book and the London chapters. I think I was more disappointed with the quick death of Dracula than anything at the end, but I understand it.

I guess as I finish the book, I'm left with a few questions and hoping Reddit can shine some light.

1. My main question...Do we ever find out why Dracula lets Jonathan return to London and does not turn him to Un-dead? I know London had that terrible Brain Fever upon his return but it seemed mostly from shock. I feel like I must have missed something because why did Dracula let Harker carry on his life as normal?

2. Was there an implied lesbian relationship between Mina and her best friend Lucy or was that just the style of the times? I thought especially in their initial diaries to each other, their language felt much more romantic than just platonic, but I admit that I can see that being a function of the era.

3. Was this novel the ""Lord of the Rings/Hobbit"" of Vampire/Dracula stories going forward? What I mean by that is that did Stoker borrow from common Vampire tropes (garlic, staking the heart, turning into bats, blood sucking at the neck, Transylvania, etc), or did Bram Stoker create these tropes that Dracula/Vampire films/stories/media have used going forward?

I was only able to read a couple of pages of this book when I was a kid before my mom found it a threw it away, so I hope this is enough information for you guys!(also sorry for formatting— I’m on my phone)

The book cover: (paperback) was bluish, I believe a photo or drawing of two teens swimming towards each-other? Either that or it was just an image of an underwater scene.

Story: It began with this girl heading to class in high school, she mentioned something about kissing, sex, and some boy she was interested in. I was only able to read a couple pages so that’s about as far as I got

Genre: This was a Young Adult/Coming of Age/Romance(?) book 

Year/ targeted age group:  I had picked up the book at the school book fair i think in 2006. It was in the 7th-8th grade section. At the time, I was in the 3rd grade, so obviously when I took it home and casually mentioned that I was reading a book about sex to my mom, she either returned it to my school or threw it away.

ffk1jo,goblintwat,How to solve book slumps?,"Hi all. I believe book slumps are personal attacks on individuals and solving them usually needs personalized help. But I'm hoping there may be some tips, tricks, or specific books that can help. 

I've been in a terrible slump since the end of 2017. That December, I tore through ""Fingersmith"" by Sarah Waters. It was an amazing read. I highly recommend it. But lots of things happened in early 2018 in my life, plus the political landscape has been dire, and reading has just been so difficult. I've tried hard copies, ebooks, and audiobooks. From then to now, I've finished 8 books. I used to read maybe 20-30 books in a year. Help!

In January of this year, I did read two thrillers back to back. (They were ""Any Man"" by Amber Tamblyn and ""Dark Places"" by Gillian Flynn.) I was hoping thrillers were finally helping me shake the slump since I read them so quickly, but when I started a third book, I just couldn't get into it.

I have been reading ""Catch and Kill"" by Ronan Farrow on audiobook very slowly, and I've picked up and put down so many other books. The only genres I don't enjoy are romance or new adult. I also tend to stay away from young adult unless something is highly recommended. But those are my personal choices.

How do you get out of slumps? What's the longest slump you've had?",23,1583705078,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ffk1jo/how_to_solve_book_slumps/,books,1

ffju02,GooberBuber,American psycho is the first book I want to analyze in a long time. And I want to bounce some ideas around.,"Let me begin by saying I wasn't an English major and generally just read books to enjoy them. Rarely do i want to delve into meaning or anything. I feel too often people reas too much into books and convince themselves of themes that simply aren't there. Despite that being the case, while reading American psycho I felt almost compelled to do exactly this.

It wasn't my favorite book ever, but the mix of everything that occurred in it was fascinating to me. 

One thing that got to me big time was the title of the book. If the events of the book really happened, Patrick Bateman is Clearly a psycho.

But throughout the book, I felt like it related to so much more than just him. The entire culture he was a part of was psychotic in its own right. People so shallow that they almost never actually listen to each other in conversation, are constantly mistaking each other for somebody else, and harass beggars on the street. Pat Bateman may be a deranged killer, but his colleagues are far from innocent themselves.

But this wasn't the most fascinating part of the book. The part of the book that stood out to me the most was The Patti Winters Show. It extended this sadistic culture not just to these ultra rich disconnected wall street men. It took it to daytime tv; where you can imagine the entire nation tuning in to catch her talking about things like child rape, parents of murdered children, ridiculing obesity, etc. so that they can talk about it over the water cooler at work.

What do you think? Am I reading too much into it? Have I totally missed the point of the book? I'm fascinated to hear other people's takes on this book.",12,1583704248,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ffju02/american_psycho_is_the_first_book_i_want_to/,books,1

So, which surrealistic pieces would you consider to be also literary masterpieces that also are not Naked Lunch.

ffj1h2,TwinBoltGaming,This is the draft prologue to my book what are your thoughts?,"Prologue
""Rheiin, where are you!"" the man bellowed. He was running for his life, battered and bruised. His long grey hair was burnt and his beard was torn. Strange wounds lined his arms and had cut through the back of his tunic, the skin underneath victim to what could only be described as burns. Though these weren't ordinary burns, they stung like a thousand nettles and slowly continued to eat the flesh like acid. A putrid smell instantly spewed from the wound that smelled like the rot of a month old dead animal,marinating in its own shit.

The man was Godrick, and this night was his last. The strange shadow had attacked in the night, it came with a roar of wind and the ground shook the trees like they were simple sticks. As The Shadow pursued Godrick, it seemed to only want one thing and the aching burns on Godricks body brought only one fear to mind. Where was his Son, where was Rheiin?

I was looking through old cookbooks the other day and found “James Beard’s Treasury of Outdoor Cooking”. When I went to open it, I noticed something was weird... when you open it correctly from looking at the spine, it opens upside down and backwards. There were two - one was covered correctly, and one was upside down. I picked both of them up for $2 total. 

Apparently the publisher put this one’s hardback on backwards, or printed it upside down.. anyway, would this be worth something by virtue of it being an “oops”? I know it’s a big deal when pennies/etc are mis-printed, so I’m wondering if books are the same way. 

Here’s a link to the book (well, a normal opening one I found on a seller’s site’ in case that might help with the answer. Thanks in advance!

To be clear, the sleeve is fine. It’s when you take off the sleeve and look at the title of the book embossed on the spine itself that you orient the book upside down to open, thinking it’s the correct way,

The more you learn about Holmes the more clear it is he was a conman who killed as part of his cons but not the ""devil"" the yellow press of the time turned him into and this book does nothing to dispel the mythology.

VIRTUAL ASSISTING

This is one of the best jobs for moms during school hours because you can work a few hours helping out others with their business needs. Most hours are during the day or late at night when the kiddos are sleeping and can be done easily from the comfort of your own home! There’s never a better time than now to learn how to work from home as a virtual assistant. https://canvabestssite.wordpress.com

The great thing about being a virtual assistant is that it’s such a big umbrella for a variety of skills. You can virtually help someone with their email management, by creating infographics for them or taking stock images that they need. Basically anything in their business that is just taking too much time, you can help with!

Virtual assisting is one of the best stay at home mom jobs. It’s super flexible and the options are endless!

You also could get a job within a week and start making a few hundred dollars per month. With the growth of online businesses, more and more people are looking for virtual assistants.

FREELANCING

Free what? Freelancing is when you find jobs to do for clients. Imagine writing blog posts for a big website, or creating inforgraphics for a lifestyle influencer, or editing videos for Facebook ads.

Being a freelancer is another great work at home gig because you have the flexibility to say “yes” or “no” to projects that you want to work on. If you need a few weeks or months off to help with your children during various times, you are free to decide how much or how little you want to work.

In a few years from now, there are estimates that over 50% of the American workforce will be a part of the Gig economy.

One of the most natural jobs for moms with babies is to become a photographer. So many new moms pick up photography as a hobby once their sweet little bundle of joy is born.

Even though I’m not a professional photographer, my friends hired me at $80+ per hour to take Christmas pictures of their family.

It’s a fantastic part time job for moms because you can take on photography shoots when you have time and take off when you need to.

Did you know that bloggers and other companies actually pay for great photography and stock images to use on their blog? If you have an eye for detail, you may be able to sell some of your photos for use on other sites!

ff8uct,SutoresuNeko,The age old question: what is the best ereader (that's not a Kindle or Nook),"Ok, I've tried several Nook and Kindle devices over the last five or so years. Nook absolutely sucks. I tried two of them; both slow and unreliable. My current Kindle is driving me up the wall. I read comics and manga so I didn't want a paper white. I have the Kindle Fire HD 8"" and I hate it. I only have the nook and kindle app on it, but it's hecka slow. I've only seen worse reviews for the new 2019 7"" fire. 

So, I'm looking for an ereader without garbage ads and clutter that can handle both the Nook and Kindle reading apps. I need to use both because I have dozens of books on each.

ff8993,jangujukkuja,I just finished Circe by Madeline Miller,"I finished The Song of Achilles earlier in the week. I really loved the writing and so I grabbed Circe as soon as it was over. This book is so different in its writing style from TSOA. Achilles was a golden warrior blessed with many talents. It suited that a story about him reads more like a song. Circe is not so blessed and the prose is reflective of that. There is not much beauty in it as there is not much in Circe's life. I knew much less of the characters in this beforehand as compared to TSOA. 

As a character I related to a lot more to Circe than Patroclus. There are some thoughts I have that I've never heard articulated before Circe: the fear you're a fool and that everyone else is in on something that you don't know, wanting to have a talent that will make you special, and wanting to be seen for who you are and loved. 

I think the book is really good, but The song of Achilles gave me more joy and pleasure to read.

ff3o02,Desadarius,"The Adventures of Eddie Fung - Chinatown Kid, Cowboy, Prisoner of War (DISCUSSION)","Born and raised within the confines of San Francisco’s Chinatown, Eddie Fung left home as a sixteen-year-old in 1938 searching for broader horizons. Dreaming of a romantic life as a cowboy, he ended up on a West Texas ranch, where he built fences, maintained windmills, doctored cattle, planted crops, and learned how to pace himself for long days of backbreaking labor. “It was nothing but hard work,” he recalls in this engaging memoir. “So, right away, my illusions of the movie cowboy were shattered” (p. 45). 

As it turned out, Eddie’s immersion in this primitive life unwittingly prepared him for what was to follow—forty-two months in Japanese prison camps during World War II. As a member of Texas’s Lost Battalion, he became a POW along with thousands of American soldiers after the fall of Java in early 1942. The prisoners were forced to work on the Burma-Siam Railroad on reduced rations while suffering from malaria, dysentery, and tropical infections. At one point Eddie’s weight dropped to sixty pounds, even as he hauled hundred-pound loads. 

Eddie Fung describes his years as a POW without bitterness, but in vivid detail. He explains his particular experience as the only Chinese American prisoner, how he and his comrades survived on the meager rations, how they kept up morale, and how they reacted when faced with the demand to sign loyalty oaths to the Japanese Imperial Army or face execution. 

The Adventures of Eddie Fung is a remarkable book on many levels, not the least because its informant is, as editor Judy Yung describes, “a natural storyteller with a fantastic memory for detail, a precise way of expressing himself, a wonderful sense of humor, and a strong determination to tell the story right. . . . He also proved to be an unusual interviewee in that he was both introspective and analytical in his responses” (p. x). 

The portrait that emerges in Fung’s memoir is that of a restless young man who seeks adventure, but finds instead that joy comes through cooperating with others. Even as Fung debunks the romanticism of cowboy work, the life he describes possesses idyllic qualities. He recalls no meanness, but rather generous, community-minded people: “everyone just helped each other out, period. It felt so natural and so right that I thought this was the way it should be” (p. 52). 

University of California–Santa Cruz professor Judy Yung was fifty-six years old when she began conducting oral interviews in 2002 with the eighty-year-old veteran. Yung had previously interviewed some four hundred people, but she was wholly unprepared for the transformative effects of this experience. Dr. Yung, as it turned out, fell in love with Eddie and became his wife. Many readers will find this charming account of Eddie Fung’s life story similarly irresistible.

What do you believe to be the prevalent themes of this text? What do you think about Eddie's experience and how it connects to his conclusions about war? How does Judy Young help to create a history of Eddie's life?",2,1583624044,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ff3o02/the_adventures_of_eddie_fung_chinatown_kid_cowboy/,books,1

ff3kda,miriamj2000,Iliad translations: which one should I read?,"Okay so, I know there are endless discussions about this. A lot of people recommend Lattimore's translation, others recommend Fagles. Lattimore's is more accurate (if I'm correct) while Flagles' is more accessible (please correct me if I'm wrong). 

Some people also base their argument on the fact that some translations are poetry, some are prose. 

I don't mind a difficult read, however, I'm also not a Classics student, so not every sentence has to be perfectly accurate for me (though I'm also not saying throw accuracy out of the window). I enjoy both poetry and prose. 

When I was in high school, I always wanted to take Greek and Latin but I couldn't (Dutch school system, that's a different story). I like mythology, and I've read several books. I loved The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, for example (I know this is not a translation, just a different take on the Iliad, however, it's still one of my favourite books based on a myth ever). I've never read the Iliad and the Odyssey, because I never knew which translations to get, so I just kind of procrastinated. I have a big Dutch translation, but I do love reading in English, and there are way more translations in English. 

So, which one should I get? I want it to be an enjoyable read, and I don't really care about what professors approve of, I have no one to impress. However, I do like a challenging read and I do care about a bit of quality.",6,1583623596,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/ff3kda/iliad_translations_which_one_should_i_read/,books,1

Here are the rules:

1) Books can talk about ANYTHING and can be from any genre

2) Every book should be at least 50 pages

3) If a book is over 100 pages, it counts as 2 books read. Note: even if you read a book with 800 pages, it will still count as 2 books.

4) The participant gets NOTHING if he has less than 40 books read by the deadline. Even if he was short on one book.

5) The prizes are given to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

They gave us a notebook which I write the books I read on, including a summary and some details about the author/publisher.

I would go for walks on every break during my shift and listen. I would throw it when driving alone. I would put in my headphones when doing chores.

Michael Kramer and Kate Reading were the voices in my ear at every spare moment for most of a year. Yes, there were times it was a slog, but overall they were good books. Not without their fair share of flaws, but also not lacking in redeeming qualities.

After finishing audiobook 11, I read the physical copies of 12-14 in about 2 weeks. And now I'm done. I very much enjoyed the books and am glad I embarked on the adventure all those months ago, but I find myself with something of a void in me now.

He shook his head, with no sign of interest. “Never heard of it.” 

  “Somewhere, far, far away, there’s a shitty island. An island without a name. An island not worth giving a name. A shitty island with a shitty shape. On this shitty island grow palm trees that also have shitty shapes. And the palm trees produce coconuts that give off a shitty smell. Shitty monkeys live in the trees, and they love to eat these shitty-smelling coconuts, after which they shit the world’s foulest shit. The shit falls on the ground and builds up shitty mounds, making the shitty palm trees that grow on them even shittier. It’s an endless cycle.” 


I drank the rest of my coffee. “As I sat here looking at you,” I continued, “I suddenly remembered the story of this shitty island. What I’m trying to say is this: A certain kind of shittiness, a certain kind of stagnation, a certain kind of darkness, goes on propagating itself with its own power in its own self-contained cycle. And once it passes a certain point, no one can stop it—even if the person himself wants to stop it.” 

Noboru Wataya’s face wore no expression of any kind. The smile was gone, but neither was there any shadow of annoyance.

The plot is total nonsense, a mess involving giant ants, a kidnapping, hidden jewels, colonialism, and whatever. But obviously the point of the novel is mostly to see if Abish can get away with this in the first place. The answer is he can't since there are apparently several mistakes in his scheme (I've only noticed one myself though, the rest I found on the internet). Still there are some entertaining episodes, restriction giving inspiration for bizarre images. Going through the first half of the book, it's relieving to see the vocabulary expand. Going through the second half of the book, it's sad to see all these words (and therefore some characters) disappear.        

I'm wondering if anyone else has read it and has a deeper reading of the novel. The back of the book has a quote by the author saying the novel is about the distrust of communication or something. I can see some motifs about language but overall I don't really understand the main point other than the novel being a fun exercise. I recommend the novel only if you really find the experiment fascinating.",27,1583586214,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/feuuvc/alphabetical_africa_by_walter_abish_is_a_book/,books,1
feuui0,idkman214,Finally about to start reading The Count of Monte Cristo. Can you tell me if the classic lives upto the praise without spoiling the story?,"Been meaning to read this book for a long time. Its been on my to-read list since forever. It seems to be a very long book. 1700 pages. I prefer books with 150 or so pages. This one far exceeds that limit and frankly it is the major reason which has kept me from picking it up thus far despite the fact that I found the story's introductory description to have piqued my interest long ago. 

What did you think about the book? No spoilers please. Just your overall feelings? 

Is it one of those classics that lives upto the praise or is it a bit over-rated? 

Also if there is anyone among you interested in being my reading partner for this book. Please DM me. It'd bring me a great deal of pleasure in to read this book with someone and being able to offer and be offered thoughts on its themes, characters, the story etc as we read along.

Life is already depressing enough. Why would anyone want to depress himself even more with this sorrowful literature?

fet0j0,cavack,معرفی کتاب مرد گمشده اثر جین هارپر," 

**رمان مرد گمشده** **اثر** [**جین هارپر**](https://www.cavack.com/Category/Writer/2999/%D8%AC%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%BE%D8%B1) رمانی است هیجانی و با داستانی رازآلود که داستان سه برادر را که جسد یکی‌شان به تازگی پیدا شده است، روایت می‌‌کند.  جین هارپر نویسنده‌ای استرالیایی است که پیش‌ از‌ این کتاب‌های خشکسالی و نیروی طبیعت به قلم او منتشر شده‌ ‌اند. **رمان خشکسالی** توانست عنوان بهترین رمان جنایی سال ۲۰۱۷ را به انتخاب آمازون از آن خود کند و رمان مرد گمشده نیز که در سال ۲۰۱۸ روانه‌ی بازار شد توانست **جایزه‌ی بهترین رمان جنایی** را به انتخاب **گودریدز** به خود اختصاص دهد.

برگردان فارسی رمان مرد گمشده اثر جین‌ هارپر به **ترجمه‌ی میثم فرجی** و از **انتشارات سنگ** در اختیار علاقه‌مندان قرار گرفته است. در ادامه، درباره‌ی این اثر جین هارپر بیشتر می‌خوانیم.

### مرگ مشکوک برادر

**داستان** در یکی از مناطق دورافتاده، گرم و خشک استرالیا اتفاق می‌افتد. بدن بی‌جان جوانک محبوب محلی، کمرون برایت، پوشیده از کثافت و خشک ۹ مایل دور از جایی که اتوموبیل او پارک است پیدا می‌شود؛ تنها دلیلی که برای مرگ او به ذهن محلی‌ها می‌رسد آن است که کمرون دست به خودکشی زده است. مرگ کمرون چندان تعجب کسی را بر نمی‌انگیزد؛ پیش از این دیگران در صحرا دست به کارهای عجیب و غریب‌تری هم زده‌اند. این حرف‌ها اما برادر بزرگ‌تر کمرون، نیتن را قانع نمی‌کند. خیلی چیزها با هم همخوانی ندارند و حتی تکه‌ای مدفون از گذشته‌ی کمرون بازگشته و او را تعقیب می‌کند.

### داستانی جنایی درباره‌ی خانواده

درنتیجه‌ی تمام این اتفاقات، داستانی شکل می‌گیرد احساسی و شخصیت محور که حول موضوع آزار و خانواده می‌گردد. نیتن بایستی خاطرات کودکی آشفته‌اش را زیرورو کند و به یاد بیاورد که بزرگ شدن با پدری شیاد چگونه است تا بتواند پی ببرد که چه بر سر برادرش، کمرون، آمده است.

**رمان مرد گمشده اثر جین هارپر** تنها رمانی جنایی نیست؛ در قلب این **رمان** داستانی است درباره‌ی خانواده، تنهایی، فرصت‌های دوباره و بخشش. این رمان مجموعه‌ای است از وفاداری‌ها و اختلافاتی که میان اعضای خانواده برایت جریان دارد و خواننده را مجذوب خود می‌کند.

### پایان قابل پیش‌بینی، مشخصه‌ی تمام داستان‌های جنایی

مرد گمشده اثری جنایی است و مانند بیشتر آثار جنایی، مخاطب می‌تواند حدس بزند که داستان قرار است به کدام سو برود اما این موضوع از لذت این داستان حتی ذره‌ای نمی‌کاهد. آثار هارپر طرفدار بسیاری دارند زیرا خانواده، شخصیت‌ها و روابط میان آن‌ها محور اصلی داستان‌های او هستند و همین سبب می‌شود داستان‌های او، چیزی بیش از حل معمای صرف باشند. **مرد گمشده اثر جین هارپر** شاید یکی از تأثیرگذارترین آثار هیجانی، جنایی باشد که تابحال خوانده‌اید؛ چراکه حتی اگر بتوانید **پایان داستان** را حدس بزنید حس نمی‌کنید که سرتان کلاه رفته است.

### دوری از کلیشه‌ها

نکته‌ی تحسین‌برانگیز دیگر درباره‌ی این اثر آن است که **نویسنده داستانی جنایی** را بی‌آنکه شخصیت اول آن کارآگاه باشد، چه خوب مدیریت کرده است. بسیاری از **نویسندگان ژانر جنایی** با خود کلنجار می‌روند تا داستان خود را قانع‌کننده جلوه دهند و راهی جز پناه بردن به کلیشه‌ها نمی‌یابند؛ جین هارپر اما برای خلق داستان شاهکارش نیازی ندارد تا کلاه شرلوک به سر نیتن کند و ذره‌بین به دستش دهد. پرده‌برداری نیتن از راز مرگ برادرش بسیار طبیعی‌تر و قانع‌کننده‌تر از آن است.

### برشی از کتاب

شب‌ هنگام که آسمان حتی وسیع‌تر به نظر می‌رسید، می‌توانست خیال کند که زمان میلیون‌ها سال به عقب بازگشته و او در حاشیه ی دریا قدم می‌زند. میلیون‌ها سال پیش و میلیون‌ها رویداد طبیعی که باید یکی پس از دیگری رخ می‌دادند تا سرزمینی را که حالا پیش‌روی اوست شکل دهند. جایی که در آن رودها بی‌آنکه باران ببارد جاری‌اند و مایل‌ها آن طرف‌تر، صدف جانوران در نبود آب فسیل شده اند، و مردانی که اتوموبیل‌شان را رها کردند خود را در چند قدمی مرگ یافتند.

### اگر علاقه‌مند به داستان‌های مهیج هستید…

گمان می‌کنم جین هارپر نویسنده‌ی مورد علاقه خیلی‌ها باشد. رمان مرد گمشده کتابی یک‌جلدی است که مانند رمان‌های پیشین جین هارپر، خشکسالی و نیروی طبیعت، نویسنده از محیط نهایت استفاده را برده تا عنصر هیجان را در داستانش پرنگ و پررنگ‌تر کند. اگر علاقه‌مند به داستان‌های مهیج هستید می‌توانید همین حالا رمان مرد گمشده را از **وبسایت**[ **کتابفروشی کاواک**](https://www.mag.cavack.com/) خریداری نمایید.

Kind of like voodoo type rituals being performed that forced the victim to kill them self. Required a photo of the victim.

feqtkp,belbivfreeordie,Hello. I would like to encourage you to read Independent People by Halldór Laxness.,"I was in Iceland hiking on a glacier and my tour guide encouraged me to ask him anything about Icelandic culture along the way. I only had one question that did not pertain to glaciers:

""What is an Icelandic book that every Icelandic person reads when they are in school?""

His first thought was to mention the eddas but I clarified that I meant something like a modern novel, and he said ""Well, there is a book called—"" (here he said some Icelandic words) ""—I think in English it's called *Independent People.""*

I just finished this book and found it so moving, intelligent, rich and culturally fascinating that I wanted to bring it to your attention. It is comparable to *One Hundred Years of Solitude* in its sense of near-timelessness, its epic span of several decades and its tinge of magic underlying things otherwise very much rooted in the hardscrabble life of a poor sheep-farming man and his family. But the character of that man reminds me of *The Remains of the Day*. His principles and his steadfast adherence to them are admirable in their own way, but they cause him to repeatedly make heartbreaking decisions that rob him of every happiness other than the righteousness that comes from following them. It's a novel that is nearly satirical in tone, but at the same time suffused with a sense of deep sincerity and peppered with passages of true beauty. 

I'm a person who rarely reads a book I've never heard of. I love plowing my way through the canon and experiencing books that are commonly esteemed Great. This is considered such a book in Iceland and I believe if it were better known to the English-speaking world, it would be spoken of in the same breath as many of the great Russian novels. I'm glad I made time for it.",12,1583559314,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/feqtkp/hello_i_would_like_to_encourage_you_to_read/,books,1

I wanted it to be spoiler-free while communicating something of my enjoyment of the book along with my reservations (but still a 4-star read in my opinion).

American Gods is an odd book that grabbed me in places and pushed me away in others. It came across to me as a mythic story built around an extended episode of *Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives* that went horribly wrong. In places, that mythic story is brilliant, yet Gaiman remains fixated on the seediness of American beliefs, customs, and history to a degree that I sometimes felt detracted from the story.

fepelc,Amarella,My thoughts on Solaris,"So I just finished Solaris by Stanislaw Lem. The reviews were great and I was told it is a quintessential sci-fi read.



Unfortunately, while I can appreciate it, it wasn't for me. 



For a 205 page book, it was surprisingly difficult for me to get through. I enjoyed the first half of it but then I felt as though Lem got caught up in a style that read almost like a research paper in a lot of ways. It was disappointing to be really into an emotional part of the book and then be cut off by pages and pages of what felt to me like over explained fictional science. If he cut out half of his explanation of the science behind Solaris, I feel like I would still understand his points and honestly I feel like it would of actually  hit harder. I was forcing myself to read through these passages in order to get to the parts that really resonated with me. 



Overall, I think it is a good book. I can't deny that Lem had some great ideas and really encouraged some unique introspection. I found myself hooked to the story at certain points.

fep97u,RobotWritersAIDotCom,Artificial Intelligence Generated Writing: Top Ten Trends for 2020,"  

[Twenty Twenty will continue to see an embrace of AI-generated writing by virtually every major industry -- including, of course, book publishing.](https://robotwritersai.com/artificial-intelligence-generated-writing/)

Increasing numbers of news outlets will continue to boldly experiment with the tools — as will advertisers and public relations pros.

More individual businesses will also grab the technology to auto-write company reports based on info from their databases.

And AI personalization – the ability to generate highly customized news and other writing based on what smartphone readers are tapping, swiping and commenting on as they interact with text – will continue to crop-up in a number of implementations.

But the tech will also inspire its fair share of controversy.

Many writers — especially journalists and copywriters — will continue to view AI as synonymous with job loss.

And media watchers will continue to sound the alarm as free AI software capable of generating fake news will continue to be released to the general public.

All told, scores of trends will impact the spread of AI-generated writing across the globe.

feolri,cridex,What advice would you give Holden Caulfied in J.D. Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye'?,"I'm not quite sure if this is a hundred percent right on this sub, but I couldn't think of a better one.

In October 2019 I read Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye' for the first time and fell in love with it, read it two times since. I just could really connect to Holden. Not only did I understand him, but I was (or am) in a similar situation.

Let me elaborate.

Before I read this book, I moved to a new city to study at a university but realized fast that this was not the path I will end up happy on. So I often found myself walking around the city, not knowing anybody and with nothing I could really do, until I eventually stopped visiting my university. I was alone and without aim.

The Catcher in the Rye was the perfect thing too read in that situation. Just like Holden, I tried to find people to hang out with and tried to push away the fact that I, currently, have no perspective in my life. While this is the part I most resonated with him and the part I'm concentrating on, there were a lot more things in which I saw parts of myself in Holden, for instance, his interpretation of the name-giving 'Catcher in the Rye'.

The thing is, my situation hasn't changed. And I'm still aimless. It hasn't been three days for me, but a few months now. Let's just say I could use some advice.

So I just wanted to ask you: What advice would you give Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye?",18,1583547798,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/feolri/what_advice_would_you_give_holden_caulfied_in_jd/,books,1

*Edgar Allan Poe*

Gaily bedight,
A gallant knight,
In sunshine and in shadow,
Had journeyed long,
Singing a song,
In search of Eldorado.

But he grew old-
This knight so bold-
And o'er his heart a shadow
Fell as he found
No spot of ground
That looked like Eldorado.

And, as his strength
Failed him at length,
He met a pilgrim shadow-
""Shadow,"" said he,
""Where can it be-
This land of Eldorado?""

Of the Moon,
Down the Valley of the Shadow,
Ride, boldly ride,""*

femz23,Daviddaprodigy,Trouble with fiction immersion due to depression?,"I haven’t found much on this topic, but I was a HUGE fiction junky. Manga, comic books, fictional books(Mostly mystery/romance genre), Anime, cartoons, videogames, YOU NAME IT! I could just immerse myself into everything fiction, loved and appreciated the world, characters, art, literature, storytelling, and just about everything. I was also never picky about anything I enjoyed just about anything even books and manga many considered bad. Guilty pleasures of mine I guess haha. 

Well late January I started having really frequent and long Panic attacks, so I saw a psychiatrist after 3 weeks of agony. Diagnosed with Anxiety, Agoraphobia, and got on medication for that and my newly developed insomnia. I started getting better, 2 weeks without anymore panic attacks, but about a week and a half ago I started feeling empty. I always liked looking at my lockscreen saver(it’s official artwork of a girl named “Suruga Kanbaru” from the novel “Bakemonogatari”) but I noticed it no longer really gave me much of a spark as it did. So I started reasearching if anyone else just kinda started feeling empty and emotionless outta nowhere. I eventually ended up on a thread about favorite characters of a series and a comment stated “Why do people care if characters die? I just laugh because they’re fake and never existed.” And another comment on another post saying “I can’t take fiction seriously because it’s all fake and never happened! I think real history is much better because it’s real people and real events, not made up fantasy.” 

I know this sounds weak minded(maybe because I read those things in an already weak minded state) but eversince then my immersion for all fictional media has dwindled and i’ve had a hard time reading anything or watching anything without those comments popping up at the back of my mind. Not sure if this is depression, overthinking due to my anxiety, but it’s caused my panic attacks to return and my anxiety to skyrocket because it kind of made me feel like what I was so passionate about was all just pointless. And my current greatest fear is that I won’t get that passion and spark/immersion back because those negative comments will keep popping up in my mind whenever I try to immerse myself into anything. I haven’t been diagnosed with depression but according to many that’s what that empty feeling and loss of motivation was.

Sorry for the long post it’s just really been bugging me lately.

P.S. I have another appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow but I thought i’d put this out there anyway incase anyone has been through this or has any advice.",13,1583540217,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/femz23/trouble_with_fiction_immersion_due_to_depression/,books,1

femex0,Sevault,"Recommendations for books about corrupted dimensions, failed timelines, etc.","I realized the other day that some of my favorite moments from books/shows are those where a character is transported to a dimension/world where everything is deeply corrupted or destroyed and they need to find a way out. That's pretty vague, so I'll give some examples:
In The Wheel of Time (book 2, I think), Rand travels to an alternate version of his world where most everything has died, and massive swaths of the world are scorched. One of the few inhabitants is a near-almighty villain with unknown motives.
In The Time Machine, the final time period he visits is one where the world has stopped turning, the planet is coated in ice, the sun hangs huge and dying in the sky, and the only signs of life are lichen and a mysterious blob of tentacles.
In The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (whatever, man, this show is great), the main characters teleport to a version of their world where all life has vanished except for huge, looming, spectral giants destroying everything.
For me, the appeal is the huge amount of mystery, suspense, and tension. When the rules of your known reality no longer apply, anything can happen, and everything is unexpected. I'm looking for books that explore this topic in more detail. Any tips would be appreciated.

fellsz,Valorea,Update to Junji Ito's Uzumaki,"The book got me good. The burn was so slow I didn't feel it.  When I got to chapter 15-16 things really started to connect and I couldn't stop reading. When the stories started to focus more on the town as a whole, it made shuichi and kirie being ""blank protagonists"" more bearable and understandable, and really furthered the impact and corruption of the spirals.  The snails were the most discomforting elements of horror in the beginning and seeing them towards the end was impactful and deeply disturbing.

I'm so glad I continued to read this book because it is one hell of a ride. There's enough context to know what's going on, but also enough left to the imagination that you can't stop thinking about other details and filling in the gaps yourself. The discomfort is incredible.  

I see the spirals now everywhere, and I can't stop thinking about the book.

As someone who has recently come to terms with who he is (I was 21 when I realized that I wasn't straight lmao) I've made it a point to catch up on all the books I may have missed out on in my teenage years, particularly on the YA genre.

I also find it exhilarating that it's now significantly less taboo and more accessible to get your hands on books like this. Books that are so personal it starts to feel as if it's yours, and yours alone. It filled me with so much pride and joy when I found out that the generation coming after mine finally has a wider selection of books that they could indulge in. I'm beaming with joy just thinking that books like this are embraced by a wider audience now.


TL;DR
Please recommend more LGBT themed YA novels to someone who's rediscovering the genre at 24 years old, yes?

Usually, ""world-building"" is used in a sort of nebulous way. Examples include ""strong magic-system"" or ""fleshed-out races.""

The hardships and adversities. The death of his closest friends and family. His years of persecution and perseverance. His beautiful character and way of being. The love and reverence his companions had for him, no king no Cesar, no pope, no leader in history had. 

This is a recommended read for both those who believe and disbelieve In his message, as it is worth knowing about the most influential person In history who is loved by millions, maybe billions in the past and current time.

I loved the writing style and I felt like it was the definition of an easy read... something I really needed after the last book I read (A Canticle for Lebowitz).

The pace of this book was perfect. There were times when it was quiet and reflective, but while some books may milk that for too long, Heller brings in some action just at the right time, every time. 

This has been compared to The Road, but I enjoyed this book so much more. I love end-of-the-world books but The Road was almost TOO bleak. But with The Dog Stars I felt somewhat hopeful, even when things looked bad.

The ending was a little too cliff-hangery for me but not enough to be a detriment. A sequel would be great but certainly not necessary.",7,1583516452,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/feh1ep/just_finished_the_dog_stars_by_peter_heller/,books,1

fefdos,Yobfesh,Interesting looking at the original reviews of some old favorite SF books at Kirkus," These are excerpts of the original reviews at Kirkus. [https://www.kirkusreviews.com/](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/)

[House of Suns](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alastair-reynolds/house-of-suns/)\-  Absorbing, but lacking the edgy brilliance and almost desperate urgency of the Revelation novels.

[Lord of Light](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/a/roger-zelazny-2/lord-of-light/)\- A parabolic put-on for only religious devotees.

[Nine princes in Amber](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/a/roger-zelazny-4/nine-princes-in-amber/)\-  There's a lot of out-of-focus pocus like communicating via a pack of  cards but Mr. Zelazny manages to sustain a certain eerie reality.

[The Day of the Triffids](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/a/john-wyndham/the-day-of-the-triffids/)\- After reading this little horror you will toss your innocent geranium out the window.

[Excession](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/iain-m-banks/excession/)\-  Chattering spaceships with splendid if confusing names (e.g., Not  Invented Here and Shoot Them Later) don't compensate for the absence of  real characters.

[Dune](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/frank-herbert/dune-3/)\-   With its bug-eyed monsters, one might think Dune was written thirty   years ago; it has a fantastically complex schemata and it should   interest advanced sci-fi devotees.",1,1583509959,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fefdos/interesting_looking_at_the_original_reviews_of/,books,1

feeqew,doper_caicos,A few things about Animal Farm...,"I reread it a couple of weeks ago, what a great book. However, there’s something I can’t understand. As you know, many of this animals represent actual people. Old Major is Marx, Napoleon is Stalin, Snowball is Trotsky, Mr. Jones is Tsar Nicholas II, Moses represents the Russian Orthodox Church, the young pigs are other important soviet leaders (like Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, etc.) that were killed by Stalin on the Great Purge and Boxer represents the working class. These are all the notable allegories I can think of at the moment. As you may have noticed, there’s an important absence: Vladimir Lenin. Do you guys know why Orwell didn’t include him in the story?

My other question is regarding the movie of the late 90s based on this book. I saw it as child, but can’t remember anything about it. I’m curious about the adaptation, because it was definitely aimed at children. To what extent does it follow the book? Is it blatant anti-soviet propaganda? If that is the case, why?

fedt19,elechner,Brainquake by Samuel Fuller,"Last year I discovered I loved pulp novels. Once I made this discovery I wanted to find a novel written by Samuel Fuller. He’s high on my list of favorite directors. This book took a lot of twist and turns. This book subverted a lot of my expectations. Every time I thought I had an idea of how the story was going to play out the book went “nice try” and would go in a completely different way. I highly recommend this book. From here on I’m going to spoil the book if you haven’t read it yet.

When Zara makes her way to France I thought “okay she’s going to save Paul and Michelle” then you read a chapter following Father Flanagan where he spots Zara and throws her off a building. Not only does that happen you then read on to find out a father Flanagan feels guilty for killing her and that he’s a Norman with morals. Michele was a very interesting character it relatively late in the book where she shows her true colors as the femme fatal. I though Paul was going to overcome the brainquakes  but that ends in tragedy that I was not expect. It’s bitter sweet that Father Flanagan comes across Michelle and Eddie at the end of the book because I’m glad they get what’s coming to them but you also feel bad for their son. Luckily Father Flanagan has somewhat of a good conscious and says he’ll donate the stollen money to the orphanage.",2,1583503004,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fedt19/brainquake_by_samuel_fuller/,books,1

It's really popular in Germany and even has its own movie now, especially the audio books are very popular. They are read by the author himself and he really nails it. It's a story about the author himself and the life he lives together with a communist Kangoroo and it's as weird and grotesque as it sounds but it's just so hilarious. However this book picks up on a lot of german stereotypes and current political situations and the current society in Germany. That's why I was wondering how it's like to read as someone who isn't german. So has anyone ever read it?",34,1583490737,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/febnbc/has_any_nongerman_ever_read_the_kangoroo/,books,1

Whilst fantasy has one of the most successful subreddits on reddit crime seems to be neglected despite being a hugely successful genre. 

Not only is it successful and popular but it has a wide variety of different sub genres including police procedurals, historical, cosy crime, serial killer, psychological etc. 

So I decided to start a subreddit specifically for fans of crime and thrillers both readers and writers. It’s called r/Crimefiction and I’d love some folks to pay it a visit and get stuck in. 

I’d also love a volunteer or two to join me as mods to set the whole thing up properly as my IT knowledge is nowhere near as good as my knowledge of thrillers!",3,1583488916,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/febdpt/crime/,books,1

feaxir,AutoModerator,"Weekly Recommendation Thread: March 06, 2020","Welcome to our weekly recommendation thread!  A few years ago now the mod team decided to condense the many ""suggest some books"" threads into one big mega-thread, in order to consolidate the subreddit and diversify the front page a little.  Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!

 **The Rules**

 * Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.

 * All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.

 * All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.

 ____

 **How to get the best recommendations**

 The most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.  Other helpful things to think about are genre, length and reading level.

 ____

 All Weekly Recommendation Threads are linked below the header throughout the week to guarantee that this thread remains active day-to-day.  For those bursting with books that you are hungry to suggest, the suggested sort is new; you may need to do this manually if your app or settings means this does not happen for you.

 If this thread has not slaked your desire for tasty book suggestions, we propose that you head on over to the aptly named subreddit /r/suggestmeabook.

feaqfw,hokostar,Feynman lectures,"I couldn' t really understand what feynman meant about perpetual machines in his first book ""Consider weight-lifting machines—machines which have the property that they lift one weight by lowering another. Let us also make a hypothesis: that there is no such thing as perpetual motion with these weight-lifting machines. (In fact, that there is no perpetual motion at all is a general statement of the law of conservation of energy.

We must be careful to define perpetual motion. First, let us do it for weight-lifting machines. If, when we have lifted and lowered a lot of weights and restored the machine to the original condition, we find that the net result is to have lifted a weight, then we have a perpetual motion machine because we can use that lifted weight to run something else. That is, provided the machine which lifted the weight is brought back to its exact original condition, and furthermore that it is completely self-contained — that is, it has not received the energy to lift that weight from some external source.

We imagine that there are two classes of machines : those that are not reversible, which includes all real machines, and those that are reversible, which of course are actually not attainable no matter how careful we may be in our design of bearings, levers, etc.

We suppose, however, that there is such a thing — a reversible machine — which lowers one unit of weight (a pound or any other unit) by one unit of distance, and at the same time lifts a three-unit weight. Call this reversible machine, Machine A.

Suppose this particular reversible machine lifts the three-unit weight a distance X. Then suppose we have another machine, Machine B, which is not necessarily reversible, which also lowers a unit weight a unit distance, but which lifts three units a distance Y. We can now prove that Y is not higher than X; that is, it is impossible to build a machine that will lift a weight any higher than it will be lifted by a reversible machine.

Let us see why. Let us suppose that Y were higher than X. We take a one-unit weight and lower it one unit height with Machine B, and that lifts the three-unit weight up a distance V. Then we could lower the weight from Y to X, obtaining free power, and use the reversible Machine A, running backwards, to lower the three-unit weight a distance X and lift the one-unit weight by one unit height. This will put the one-unit weight back where it was before, and leave both machines ready to be used again! We would therefore have perpetual motion if Y were higher than X, which we assumed was impossible.

With those assumptions, we thus deduce that Y is not higher than X, so that of all machines that can be designed, the reversible machine is the best.""

""The 16th edition of the Tournament of Books, presented by Field Notes®, begins on Friday, March 6, 2020. Here’s what you need to do before the action begins.

How it works: Over the course of 18 matches—one each weekday—two works of fiction will go head to head, with one of our judges deciding which book moves forward in the brackets, according to whatever criteria matters to them. Along the way, the judges reveal their biases and interests, any connections they have to the participating authors, and, most importantly, an elaborate explanation of how they decided between the two books.

From the eight opening round matches to the four quarterfinal matches through the two semifinal matches—and the potentially Tournament-disrupting “Zombie Round”—our original field of 18 competitors is whittled down to two finalists that will enter our March 31 championship match. There our entire judging panel weighs in, each judge picking their favorite of the two final books, and the book that receives the most votes takes home our 2020 Rooster.""

I thought they were so unique and didn't at all have the exact same plot. I let that love for writing die. I don't think I ever fought very hard to get it back. I used to write/type extensive daily journal entries. I was recording the history of my life. I believed those words would be preserved forever.  I would go on memory purges and delete hundreds(maybe?) of journal entries. I tore up my dragon scale and dream journals and fed them to a fireplace. I think words started to come back to me 5 or so years ago. I felt more sure of myself. I decided to pick the laptop back up. I can't remember exactly what I wrote. Most likely a couple of scattered journal entries. I also thought it was super cool to start an entry with whatever song I found deep at the moment.  I don't delete them anymore. I let them stay. I let myself remember them. I don't purge myself unless I truly want to. I get to choose what stays. I've never tried to force my writing because I don't think i can.

fe45bl,PoetWarriorLover,"Reading and Short-Term Memory, A Skill or Am I Cursed?","Hi everyone,

So I'm in my first year of university, studying English Literature and Philosophy. I never read much growing up but started falling in love with books about 3 years ago. In my first year I'm discovering that I may in fact have ADHD, the inattentive kind (not officially diagnosed, but close). This is most prevalent in my student life in regards to reading.

&amp;#x200B;

When reading, I have real difficulty remembering the point of a sentence by the time I get to the end of it, especially if it contains more than comma. In philosophy this is giving me headaches in books and in debates, where I'm trying to grasp onto multiple ideas, understand them and then find a relation. I find myself re-reading, over and over again and it can be pretty demoralizing, especially when some people can take a complex sentence, and dissect each part and spit it back out in an intriguing, yet orderly fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

I was wondering if there was anyone who has experience with this type of issue, whether firsthand, as a parent or as an instructor?  Is there any way to improve my recall, comprehension and focus aside from simple practice? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any advice.",11,1583450526,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fe45bl/reading_and_shortterm_memory_a_skill_or_am_i/,books,1

I've always wanted to cut back on my sugar intake, so I recently picked up a copy of A Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes.

Anyway, can anyone recommend a similar book for alcohol? 

I'm seeing a lot of memoirs and shit, but self-help books are a drag. I'm looking for fact-based non-fiction - ""this is what alcohol does to your body, this is how Big Alcohol convinces you to keep drinking it, and this is the worldwide effects of the former two.""

fe2yjr,DarthNexun,Stephen King’s ‘The Shining’ (spoilers),"I’m new to Stephen King, having read ‘The Institute’ first and now this. I’ve got my list of books I’ll be reading that align with the recommendations I’ve received from other fans. I’m into action, horror, thriller, emotions and characters. Meaning ‘Pet Semetary’, ‘The Green Mile’, ‘The Stand’, ‘Carrie’ and ‘The Outsider’ are on my ‘up next’ list. 

I’ve just finished reading the book and as I expected, it was brilliant. There were some parts that I admit, genuinely bored me but I was won over by the intensity, suspense and thrill. Overall, I really, really enjoyed it. The ending was spoiled for me when I was searching for the synopsis before reading the book, because I had heard of it, I knew it was horror but I didn’t actually know what it was about. 

The ending was emotional, It was so sad for Danny having to watch his own father kill himself right in front of him. And then Hallorann saves the day! I really liked him. He travelled all that way, went through all that trouble for a boy. What a guy! He was amazing. 

The scene that I remember the most that bored me was the boiler scene. Where Jack was being shown how the boiler worked. Boilers don’t interest me in the slightest, I was surprised I was able to read past it and didn’t put the book down. I suppose it was the horror I was waiting for kept me reading. 

Other than this, I enjoyed the horror. From Tony, to the moving hedges, to the spirits in the ballroom. That and the connection to the characters was the stuff that kept me reading. 

I liked Jack but it’s a shame that he became such a horrible person to the point where he destroyed his family.

Wendy deserved better! Gosh, I felt so sorry that for months on end she had to put up with her abusive husband. 

Poor Danny! He deserved a better childhood. And that thought popped up in my head again in the fishing scene in the Epilogue. He needed a break, a break to talk about his emotions and to clear his mind. The experience at the Overlook was an undeserved hell of a ride for such a tender age. 

Despite the boiler scene, I’m going to give it a 10/10. Because Stephen King, the master that he is, was able to hook me on. I couldn’t stop reading, even when I had work to be done. I loved the way he describes things, the way he builds up to things, the master of suspense as I’ve heard. I really enjoyed it. I had this sort of feeling, almost sadness when I was approaching the end. I didn’t want it to end! 

I’ll be reading ‘Doctor Sleep’ next. I’ve recently been eyeing ‘The Stand’ because having read the description, it’s a story set in a post apocalyptic world, and those two words alone immediately grabbed my attention. However, I’m not too keen on eye widening word counts, but 1500 words is like heaven or ‘the more the better’ for me considering I’m glued to the description of the story.",9,1583445684,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fe2yjr/stephen_kings_the_shining_spoilers/,books,1

You can find it in many of Jorge Luis Borges' works and I was curious if anyone had a better understanding of what this is, and what its literary function is?

It doesn’t motivate me to keep reading, but I still feel like if I don’t read this book I’ll be missing the comprehension necessary to read certain literary works.

In high school I got C’s in all of my English classes, mostly due to reading comprehension, and also that was my worst section on the SATs. I figured now that I’m older and bolder, I should attempt to fix these skills that have lain dormant since high school. When searching this subreddit, people recommend this book all the time, but maybe it just isn’t for me? It’s ~400 pages, and I’ve devoted at least 6-8 hours to it and have only made it a quarter through the book. Whether it’s my undiagnosed ADHD, or just the breadth of information coming through these pages, I just feel like I won’t be able to take what I learn from this book to future readings unless I treat the book like a course and write down all the “rules for reading X genre”.

fe18e5,hamby-dandy,What's a preference you've developed and why?,"Over time, I've noticed that as I read more for my own entertainment, I've developed some very specific preferences for the kinds of books I gravitate towards. For example, I recently realized that I really don't like fictional stories that are told from a first-person perspective. There are a few reasons for this (**NOTE:** these are just my opinion; please don't eviscerate me):

1. It unnecessarily limits the story. As a writer, you can create something much more robust if you're not limited to a specific character's perspective.
2. You either don't get enough detail (particularly if the setting is one of the author's own making) *or* you do get enough detail, but then it feels weird because no one thinks or talks in that much detail 24/7.
3. Because the narrator is telling the story from their individual perspective, you know that nothing too dire is going to happen to them. If it does, there's no one left to tell the story. So it kind of spoils the story a bit.

So now I'm curious...what preferences do you have when it comes to reading? What was it that caused you to develop those preferences?",28,1583439146,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fe18e5/whats_a_preference_youve_developed_and_why/,books,1

fe17hg,So_Much_So,Wasn't Quite Ready for Blood Meridian,"                              *SOME SPOILERS*

This is one of those legendary novels you hear about through conversation, top one hundred novels of the century lists, and by the name of the author himself. I spoiled it for myself on Wikipedia the moment I heard about it because I just couldn't keep away from knowing how ""really fucking dark"" it was. No matter where I read or heard about it the verdict was always the same: This book is not for the faint of heart. 

Its Wikipedia entry ends the summary with something like ""It's implied the Judge rapes the Kid"" or something to that effect. Yeah, that sounded pretty chilling to me. I'd hear about it now and then for years and say ""I gotta read that.""

Well, as of today I finally broke the first hundred pages after borrowing it off a friend, and... Goddamn. 

I read ""The Road"" before this. The basement and baby passages were, obviously, horrifying and soul-darkening. The ending of that book and several sections throughout, however, are filled with a quiet humanity that helps lift the heart through the rest of that book's depictions of despair and horror. The ending made me cry, made me feel just a little bit hopeful. The fire and all that...

It's like McCarthy learned his lesson from that book and decided to squeeze ""Blood Meridian"" dry of all hope then saturate the hollow places with revolting, horrific, soulless violence. 

I mean, I get the point and that he's not some sadistic nihilist, just an unrivaled writer who picked this particular story, but fuck me is this book horrifying. I'm not someone who absorbs gore and violence like a flower does sunshine, but there are very few parts in any books I've ever read that made me stop, put down the book, re-read the passage, and audibly say ""What the fuck."" So far there's been three such passages in only the first hundred pages: the Judge convincing the townspeople to murder the priest (and he gets away with it?!), the murdering of the captain's entire cavalry (McCarthy inserts one part about the Comanche sodomizing dead soldiers like it's a goddamn throwaway line); and the baby tree.

Oh dear Christ, the Tree of Dead Babies...

Oh, and that poor fucker Spoule. I mean... just... ugh.

I'm blown away by the syntax, obviously, even though I'm confounded by half the words he employs. And the flow is so natural and graceful that it feel like I'm floating over a patient river, hitting rapids here and there. The imagery is stark, captivating. The imagination and, I assume, research he put in is mindboggling in its depth. The commitment to theme extraordinary. The characters are enchanting in that way sirens are before they pull you into the deep.

(As a sidenote, I am blown away by how this dude puts spoilers under every chapter head and STILL shocks me. Like, damn dude, how'd you do that?!)

All in all, a masterpiece. But I didn't need to say that for it to be true. I just had to say... well... shit, this book is scary as hell. Had to get it off my chest. 

Anyone else had a similarly visceral reaction to this book? Did any other book get you like this? I'm not even finished the thing and I'm already scared to turn the page...",15,1583439049,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fe17hg/wasnt_quite_ready_for_blood_meridian/,books,1

And they saw each other again years later. I don't mind if they had divorce and all the blended family issues are being part of the book. 
Thank you all!",1,1583433991,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdzw0e/romance_second_chance_suggestion/,books,1

fdzhjo,leowr,First Discussion Thread for The Grace of Kings by Ken Liu - March Book Club,"Hello everyone,

Welcome to the first discussion thread for *The Grace of Kings*. Hopefully you were all able to get your hands on a copy. For those of you that are joining us for the first time, you will find several discussion questions below but you are welcome to discussion whatever you want from the first two parts.

* Liu has given many of the characters a motivation for the actions they are taking, whether Mata's desire for revenge for his family or Crupo's desire to be considered the greatest and for several other characters as well. Whom do you empathize with most?

* What do you think of the world-building in the book so far? 

&gt; I just promise myself to do the most interesting thing every time there's an opportunity

* What are the benefits and disadvantages of living your life that way? Would you like to make that promise to yourself?

* What do you think of Jia and Kuni's relationship?

* Where do you think Emperor Mapidéré went wrong as a ruler?

* Who is your favorite character so far?

&gt; There is often no line between perfection and evil.

* What do you think of this statement? Do you agree with it or not?

You slept well, you've got no distractions, and you're eager to find out what's on the next page(s), reading a book with a small-medium font. How many pages would you read in an hour?

fdub6l,jujubaoil,"""All adaptations are fan fiction."" Agree? If yes, what would be the implications?","A friend of mine asserts that all adaptations are, in fact, fan fiction, whereas I see them as separate things.

I see fan fiction as a repurposing of elements from the source material in order to tell your own story, which is usually regarded as non-canon and may stray from canonical narrative beats and characterization. An adaptation, on the other hand, is a translation of the source material into another medium, making changes along the way that better fit said medium but attempting to stay faithful to said source material. In my mind, given these descriptions, ""bad"" adaptations are more common or easier to spot, while fan fiction is afforded more much leeway because it isn't meant to tell the same story as the source material anyway.

The implication, therefore, of classifying all adaptations as fan fiction is that they do not need to even try to be faithful to the source material. They can make sweeping changes to characters, plot points, and themes without concern for whether or not it still contributes to telling the original story. If so, where does one draw the line? When does an adaptation stop becoming an adaptation entirely? If halfway through Hamlet we see Hamlet immediately confronting Claudius about what he did and they are able to work things out and decide to rule together as a happy family, would that still even be Hamlet?

So that's my case for disagreeing with all adaptations being fan fiction. What arguments could be made in the affirmative?",12,1583410103,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdub6l/all_adaptations_are_fan_fiction_agree_if_yes_what/,books,1

fdtqnt,ThatAnimeSnob,"My impressions of ""The Lies of Locke Lamora"" by Scott Lynch","Although the title of the book gives you the impression it’s going to be about the main character, it’s more about the world he is living in. A cruel, grim world where the grownups use children to do their nasty work and kill them when they are of no use. So this is the major thing you need to keep in mind when you begin reading. It’s not about the main character, it’s about the world he lives in. And although he is the protagonist, and he does stuff all the time, and he has lots of allies and enemies, none of them are that memorable. It’s more about the cruel things that they do or that are done to them.

Basically, the book doesn’t have much of a plot or very memorable characters. It’s like a far more sinister version of Oliver Twist, in a Venice type of city, and the nasty things the orphans do so they can survive another day by stealing and ruining lives. It sounds intriguing, and for awhile it is quite captivating because of the way everyone is ruthless and swears all the time, but then you realize you are more interested in the atmosphere of the setting than the actual characters that are living in it. As I was reading it the only thing I was hearing the author telling me is “See how cruel this world is? It’s very cruel! Look at all the nasty things I am writing! It’s cruel!” And it would be fine if the length of the book was not that long or had some sort of theme or topic to explore ala Brave New World. But it doesn’t have that; it’s the adventures of a bunch of petty criminals with no real long-term objective or much of a point other than “this world is cruel”. And yes, the protagonist goes up the ranks in the hierarchy of the underworld, but it's done in a distant way. Like, I read about what he does instead of being there with him, because I like the setting more than I like him or any other character. As such I quickly found myself bored, as there was nothing to look forward to.

And it’s not like it’s badly written. As far as dialogues and descriptions go, it is splendid. If you care more about world building and crafty talking than memorable characters or fast pacing, you’re going to have a blast. Just don’t go expecting a deep story or quick plot progression, or unforgettable characters, and you will like it.",22,1583406691,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdtqnt/my_impressions_of_the_lies_of_locke_lamora_by/,books,1

fdqihp,looktotheeeast,How do you handle moving on to a new book even if you haven’t finished your current one?,"I can’t help but feel guilty lol. I recently bought The Scent Keeper by Erica Bauermeister. It was on Reese Witherspoons book list for her book club and I have really liked her past picks. This book has received a lot of good reviews and every one I asked said it blew them away or that they finished it within a day or two. I also heard it reminded a lot of people of Where The Crawdads Sing, which was my absolute favorite. So I caved and bought it.

I haven’t even gotten half way and I’m struggling to get through it. It’s not a book that makes me think “I can’t wait to sit down and read it” which is why I haven’t touched it for a while now. It’s a nice story, but it’s very imaginative and almost hard to grasp. I found the theme of scents to not be as interesting as I went though the book. But I’ve been holding off on completing dismissing it.

Now I have The Cruel Prince by Holly Black, which a lot of people love and have recommended to me. I want to read it and am going to of course, but I can’t help but feel kind of shitty about leaving my other book unfinished. It just doesn’t feel right? Lol I’m probably being dramatic. But I don’t know if I want to run through Scent Keeper and then Cruel Prince or just abandon the former and revisit it later.

I was looking for a good review but couldn't find one, so here goes:

&gt;!Its about a tween computer hacker and his two best friends 1,000 years in the future. AI has taken over everything but nobody knows it, they all just think that all the things the machine takes care of is ""natural"". !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!One day the whole thing breaks down and nobody can understand whats gone wrong or how to fix it because everything has been automated for so many generations without issue (the last power outage was in their grandparent's generation). !&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!The hero of the story, Peter, tries to figure out what is wrong and ends up hacking into the main AI that is controlling everything. The AI want's the boys help and tries to use logic to convience the boy that a fully AI humanity is the only choice. The boy reluctantly goes along with it and together they upload and ""defragment"" the entire world. !&lt;",3,1583382821,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdpwob/my_favorite_new_scifi_of_2020_blue_screen_how/,books,1

fdp5jh,Troi420,Reading the Classics Is a Process,"Getting the most out of literature is a process, and “classics” aren’t generally just books you can pick up and read with no contextualization and expect to fully appreciate in a vacuum. People in this sub frequently struggle because they approach these books with the wrong mindset. It’s not about enjoying, it’s about understanding and appreciation. That comes through study.

Hermeneutics is the field of philosophy concerned with interpreting literature, and was developed by 18th century German philosophers as a synthetic, multidisciplinary approach to textual analysis. The philosopher Johann Gottfried von Herder, developed the concept of “Einfühlung” to govern how readers should approach literature. Einfühlung, for Herder, meant “feeling your way into” a work, and Hermeneutics combined Aesthetics, Art History, Psychology, Linguistics, Anthropology etc. Einfühlung is actually the basis for the modern idea of Empathy, and the concept of Empathy in modern psychology was developed directly from Herder’s Einfühlung.

To understand a work, one must become “an extended version of the author”. You have to reconstruct their world and understand them and the societies they lived in from the inside out. To put it in perspective, how many of the books that an 18th or 19th century author read have you also read? The answer may actually be zero. Maybe the Bible? Maybe Homer for some? People grew up reading Bayle’s Critical Historical Dictionary, Fenlon’s Telemachus, Lesage’s Gil Blas. Classics that have likely never even been mentioned on this sub before. Literature is a self-reflexive, self-referential tradition.

Don’t just treat Classics like a list of famous masterpieces that can be read in isolation, in a way that doesn’t work to generate a self-supporting network of mutual contextualization. Read through the entire bibliography of an author. Then find out what books they liked and read those. And find out who their contemporaries were and read them. Study the cultural history of the eras in which they lived. Read biographies of these authors. Read secondary scholarly criticism about the books you read. You will end up developing a self-sustaining, organic approach to literary history that will naturally expand and circle back in on itself and lead you to read books that you would have never heard of otherwise.

Instead of just trying to read famous epic novels in a disconnected, random way, you can try shorter novels.

You could try ancient romances, like Daphnis and Chloe, The Golden Ass, or Ethiopian Tale. Plutarch’s Lives is another good choice. Instead of reading a huge novel like Don Quixote you can read Cervantes’ Exemplary Tales. An abridged version of the Decameron may also be fun, as those are all short stories about sex and love. Robinson Crusoe is short and sweet and also foundational to the history of modern literature. Candide is well known, and there’s also Samuel Johnson’s Rasselas. Jaques the Fatalist by Diderot. The Vicar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith. A Sentimental Journey by Laurence Sterne. The Sorrows of Young Werther by Goethe. ETA Hoffmann’s short stories are good if you like fantasy, Lovecraft, or Weird Fiction.

All these are short and manageable works.

Lastly, I would also recommend looking deeper into questions about what literature is, where meaning comes from, how art works. This may help you find answers to questions you have about why literature matters. Include philosophy, aesthetics, and literary theory in your studies, as the people who really read Classics don’t do so just for the plot. Generally the depth of an important work has more to do with the philosophical study of human nature, consciousness, how individuals fit into society, the structure of the world we live in etc. The enjoyment these books give isn’t simple or reducible to pure entertainment alone.",35,1583379120,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdp5jh/reading_the_classics_is_a_process/,books,1
fdp48u,i_sigh_less,Need book recommendations for an old blind man.,"[This](https://imgur.com/4S8M6WA) is my neighbor, Nemo.  He is 87, and legally blind.  He can't watch read or even watch TV, so he just sits around all day doing nothing.  I've gotten him enrolled in the Texas [Talking Book program](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/tbp/gstarted.html), and they've sent him [this device](https://www.tsl.texas.gov/sites/default/files/public/tslac/tbp/images/PrototypeDTB.jpg), along with several digital cartridges containing audiobooks.  Unfortunately, he hasn't liked any of the ones that they've sent.

I'm pretty sure the reason that he hasn't liked them is that they had fairly complex plots, and he has trouble following anything very complex these days.    So, I'm thinking he needs simpler books, and I'm coming to reddit for recommendations.

In short, here are some criteria I've thought up for recommendations:

1. First person perspective.  I think this will tend to be easier for him to follow.
2. Police/detective stories.  This is what he asked for.  I'm thinking what he means is probably those Humphrey Bogart-esque ""I knew this dame was trouble the minute she walked into my office"" type stories.
3. Preferably more recent books.  The reason for this is that the ones they've sent so far have obviously been copied from tape, and the audio quality isn't the best.  I'm hoping more recent books will have come from CD and be higher quality.",29,1583378968,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdp48u/need_book_recommendations_for_an_old_blind_man/,books,1

fdnxet,thankyouforfu,"The Best HORROR Books, Novels, and Stories of the Last 5 Years (2015-2019)","Hey book readers! It's always nice to have one place to find recommendations, and unfortunately it's often difficult to find said places, so I have created one based on what I've found to be considered **AWARD-WORTHY HORROR NOVELS**. 

*Essentially, these are the horror stories that were nominated for and/or won horror awards, OR were considered in that vein by readers.*

One website that might be overlooked by folks is Worlds Without End, which (fantastically!) lists ALL award-winners and nominees (going back decades) for science fiction, fantasy, and horror in one convenient place:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/books_index.asp

For the above site, you should be eyeing these major horror awards:

- Bram Stoker Award

- Shirley Jackson Award

- August Derleth Award (British based)

- Aurealis Horror Award (Australian based)


Additionally, they have a section titled ""Award Worthy Novels"" (hence where I got my idea) that has more underrated/ under-known novels as well, which is in my opinion a fantastic resource:

http://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_awardworthybooks.asp?genre=H&amp;awyr=2019

Furthermore, what has long been a mostly SciFi awards, the Locus Awards have (again) started awarding the Locus Award for Best Horror Novel as of 2017:

https://www.sfadb.com/Locus_Awards_2019

World Horror Grandmaster Brian Keene and Wrath James White also starting the Splatterpunk Awards to honor superior achievement in the sub-genres of Splatterpunk/ Extreme Horror fiction, beginning in 2018:

http://file770.com/tag/splatterpunk-awards/

Of course, there is also the Goodreads award for horror, so I have taken as many horror novels from their yearly award winners as I have the patience to write down (usually the top 10 or so).

https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-horror-books-2019

I also skimmed plenty of ""Best of 201X"" lists to make sure I didn't miss anything, such as:

fdnu0a,kikomann12,Crime and Punishment reinvigorated my love of fiction,"I was always a pretty active reader as a kid and throughout high school; Stephen King, Harry Potter, Star Wars novels, maybe not high brow literary material, but great stories that kept me engaged and reading outside of assigned school reading. Like most High Schoolers, I wasn't necessarily excited about reading Mark Twain, Shakespeare, and the like but at the end of it I could usually understand why we were supposed to read it.

Fast forward to now and it has been nearly a decade since I read much fiction due to college course loads. A couple isolated novels and stories for classes that were then analyzed in their historical context, which was interesting academic work, but it felt very rigid and took away some of the joy of reading simply for entertainment. Even now, a couple years since I've completed my M.A, I still read a lot of political science, history, philosophy, and biographies to stay current for work and also because I do still enjoy the material.

This year I decided to get back into reading fiction for enjoyment. I had first been introduced to Dostoevsky in my Russian history class in college, but we weren't assigned any of his novels to read, just learned about his stature and importance in Russian literature with the likes of Tolstoy, Pushkin, and Chekov. I'm not sure why exactly it came to my mind that I should read Dostoevsky of all the potential options for reading fiction again, but I decided to read Crime and Punishment.

I could hardly put it down! It was the most I've enjoyed reading a story in years. Of course it is a thematically heavy book, but the way it is told completely gripped me. I always enjoyed books on the darker and bleaker side, such as Let the Right One In by John Lindvquist and The Shining by Stephen King, but I don't know that either of those got to me how Crime and Punishment did. The questions of human nature and the human condition are timeless, but wrapped up in the contemporary Russian culture. The feelings of psychological terror Raskolnikov experiences felt more like what I would expect to be described and narrated by a modern thriller author.

There is so much to unpack in the novel, but what I enjoyed most was simply being engrossed in a story again, even one as dark as Crime and Punishment. It was freeing in a sense to just be reading purely for the enjoyment of a story, instead of trying to stay up to date with political science.",7,1583373075,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdnu0a/crime_and_punishment_reinvigorated_my_love_of/,books,1

fdnem0,theTrueFach4,I can't seem to remember much about most of the books I've read. Does it happen to you too?,"First of all, sorry if there's any grammar mistakes, as everyone says in here, English is not my first language.

It just dawned on me that I don't remember a single thing about many of the books I've read. Completely blank. Even the ones I do remember are a mix of fuzzy details, a character's name here and there, a scene that played vividly in my imagination, maybe just the cover of the book.

 My initial thought was that maybe I'd just forgotten my most boring experiences with books, those I picked up because I bought them, thus making me feel an obligation to read them. To a certain degree that was true. See, I can forget all the details of what I've read within a year, but the feeling I get upon finishing a novel stays with me, and it's different every time. It's funny, I can know whether I liked a book or not based on that feeling, and at the same time not remembering a single thing about that particular novel. 

  What worries me is that I've started forgetting details about books I absolutely loved as well. They'll tend to fade slower from my mind, but in the end they all unequivocally do. Hemingway, Bukowski, Hesse, I love them, yet I can't remember their work in detail. I still remember the feeling of enjoyment I had while reading their work, which in the end, at least to me, is the most important thing.

 Curiously, I still remember in detail books I've read as a kid. It's funny how the human brain works.",29,1583371145,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdnem0/i_cant_seem_to_remember_much_about_most_of_the/,books,1

fdlkyh,Akrybion,The Volunteer by Jack Fairweather is an amazing book about an unsung hero that everyone should read.,"What does it take for someone to be called a hero? Now, I guess everyone has a different answer for this question, but I would suggest something to you: Voluntarily going to infiltrate Auschwitz, building an underground army there and sending reports out of there, in hopes of provoking the Allies to action. 

Does this sound like a kind of tasteless idea for a World War II fiction novel? Well, it probably would be, if this wasn't a real (as in non-fiction) story of the Polish soldier Witold Pilecki. 

The book takes you on the journey with Witold threw the war and the years after and at times leaves you angry, sad but also hopeful when you look up someone in the ""character"" section at the end of the book and see that he lived until after the war. 

It also helps to bring light on the struggle of the Poles under Nazi occupation; a part of the War that is often forgotten. 

And one learns about the transition of the camp of Auschwitz itself, which is also not an often talked about subject. Of course everyone knows about what happened there in general, but what does anyone feel if he just hears of a million dead? Sure, it is terrible, but also incomprihensable. In so far, it hit me personally harder to read of the first couple hundred gassings there or the senseless deaths of people on gets to know by name. But, I also want to stress that the book doesn't exploit the horror in a cheapo. It states facts and is very well researched (at least I trust it is, as i can't check the hundreds of given source documents) without sacrificing readability. This could very well be some fictional hero's story (albeit with a rather non-traditional character arc and conclusion).  

So I hoper this, probably a little rambling, post could convince some to give this book a try. Excuse my English, I am not a native speaker. I honestly think it should be something everybody, history buff or not, should read and learn about and learn about Witold. For anyone who wants to deep dive, Witold Pilecki's memoirs (""The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery"") are also available in English, though I'd still recommend ""The Volunteer"" for context.",1,1583363140,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdlkyh/the_volunteer_by_jack_fairweather_is_an_amazing/,books,0

Additionally, I see audiences of both men and women at book tours for male memoirs but predominantly women at book tours for female memoirs.

A recent example is “Becoming” by Michelle Obama. While I’m sure some men read it, a male friend remarked to me that he subconsciously labeled it a woman’s book.

Why would a woman be able to relate to a man’s story but not vice versa? What do you think can be done to reduce this sexism within the reading community? Do you even think this is a problem or am I in the minority thinking it’s a problem?

Would love to get some thoughts!!

There are a number of translations that exist, yet I haven't been able to find any of them online, only references to them.

There's a paper entitled ""Representation of social actors in Chinua Achebe’s novel “Things Fall Apart” and its two Persian translations"", which does list five separate translated editions of the book. So, they are definitely out there.

&gt; This novel has been translated  into many languages. It has attracted the attention of Iranian translators as well. Through the years, five translators have translated  it  into  Persian.The  first  translation  of  “Things  Fall  Apart”  was undertaken  by  Farhad Manshoorian  (1989)  [Hame Chiz Foroo Mipashad] (1368 Iranian  calendar);  the  second  one  [Hame Chiz Foroo Mirizad]  by Safavian  in  1999 (1378 Iranian  calendar),  the  third  one  [Hame  Chiz Foroo Mirizad] by  Ali Asghar Bahrami in 2001 (1380  Iranian calendar), the  fourth [Hame Chiz Foroo Mipashad]  by  Kamrava Ebrahimi  in  2012  (1391  Iranian calendar), and the fifth one [Hame Chiz az Ham  Mipashad]  by  Hodavand in 2012 (1391 Iranian calendar).

It even notes the two most popular translations

&gt; Among these five translations, the ones by Farhad Manshoorian (referred to as  T. A., henceforth) and  by Kamrava Ebrahimi (referred to as T. B.) were selected due to their popularity and availability.

fdj8k5,Fredegar-Bolger,What other books have a 'Scouring of The Shire' type chapter?,"For those that don't know, 'The Scouring of The Shire' is the penultimate chapter in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, in which the hobbits return to The Shire to see it under the brutal control of 'Sharkey' and his ruffians and so Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin team up with other hobbits to take back the The Shire.

Some people love this chapter, others not so much. Those that don't like it say it's out of place and takes a bit away from the big ending (The One Ring is destroyed). 

Those that do like it (I'm one of them) say it's important to the story because it's shows that no place was unaffected during the war and how the view that ""if you stay out of trouble, no trouble will come to you"" is flawed.

fdit10,Fingers_For_Toes666,Kindles really are a cheaper alternative with zlibrary.org,"Recently I’ve decided to quit my job in order to pursue my dreams. Because of this I have to be much more frugal than I was previously and budget my savings accordingly. I like buying books, a lot actually. But I can’t really afford the hobby anymore and have hold back for a bit. 

Last week I saw an ask reddit post about ‘hidden gems’ of the internet and a redditor mentioned zlibrary. At the time I didn’t know what it was, but shortly found out it’s a completely FREE library of pretty much every book imaginable. 

This next part sounds sketchy, but it’s not. If you send them ANY amount of money on an Amazon gift card you can have the books sent right to your kindle &amp; are allowed about 15 downloads a day. So, as you can imagine I bought a kindle and tried it out and it frickin works!

I know I may offend some people out there by saying that but I don't think those kinds of books are my cup of tea. I can see what people like about those kind of books but I'm at parts pretty bored by it.

On the one hand it's one of the classics that is beloved by so many and theres a reason for it so I feel really bad for not liking it that much. I feel like I miss something. On the other hand we only have that much time on this planet and we can only read that much books in that time, so I also feel like I better switch to another book that I may enjoy in comparison. 

Is there somebody with the some struggle when he doesn't like a book beloved by so many?

Do people read surreal fiction?

My writing now tends to be very surreal, particularly my poetry. Of course, if I were to write a novel it would be prose, but that too is affected.

Someone can not like books. Someone can not like a book you really enjoy. Discussion about books that not everyone likes is fine, but belittling someone for their opinion isn't.

It doesn't change my opinion about the books I like, and defending my favorites to the death probably won't do much to change minds.

I'm currently reading Pride and Prejustice by Jane Austin. At first I tried the original englisch version, because I mostly try to read the original version it was written in (I'm german, so not a native speaker). 

The book is over 200 years old so it's no surprise that the englisch used is pretty outdated at times compared to modern stuff or just hard to understand. 

I picked up the german translation of it because I got a little frustrated and it definitely works better that way. Did someone else had a similar experience with old classics in other languages than your mother tongue? Did you still just went trough with it and kept on reading nontheless? Should I maybe try to read the german version first and come back to the englisch one?",1,1583345152,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdgze3/reading_pride_and_prejustice_and_the_englisch_is/,books,1

Holy crap was that powerful. That’s a book that will stay with me for a while. I read it in one sitting and love so much about it.

I want to call attention to a couple things:

The parallel structure is almost poetic, like an ABCDDCBA set up. Starts and ends in the same place with Lenny asking about the farm (A) a mercy killing (B) Curley/Lennie conflict (D) Curley’s Wife flirts with Lenny (D). It’s obviously not super precise but I loved that. 

I also loved the look at mental illness in the 30s, that was incredible. I’ve worked with people with mental illness (usually autism) and it’s spot one. Does anyone know if Steinbeck had any direct experience with mental illness because oh damn did he nail it. 

I cried at the end.

fdfylu,Pender891,A note of criticism to Brandon Sanderson,"I would be a madman to not admit that Brandon Sanderson is by a margin the best fantasy writer of our days. I loved Mistborn so much that after i finished it i immediately jumped in Stormlight Archive and then Skyward. I love that every one of his book shares some similarities in the societies he builds, where there is discrimination but not in a conventional way.

&amp;#x200B;

BUT as i said, there is criticism to be made and if i were a writer, no matter how praised, i would love to know what i could improve. I know what i'll say won't change a thing but we're on the internet and i get to share my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wish his books weren't aimed to such a young audience. Maybe i'm too used to darker and gory books and yes i'm just expressing my personal taste but... It would help in his character development. For example Vin in Mistborn, \[minor spoiler, literally the first few pages\] Sanderson clearly avoided mentioning rape risk when she's was the gang. I mean come on... The situation was screaming about it and no i'm not at all suggesting he should have included rape in his story. But sexual advances that she can avoid using her ""luck""?  

 Or the way he doesn't like to describe gory fights when they're clearly so, the way he doesn't put cussing words in any of his books (WHICH IS FINE, star wars does the same, i actually love that every story has its own specific terms) but you get what i mean. I just wish they were more adult because i love when a good story can punch me in the gut and make me flinch as long as it's well written and he definitely can write a good story.

fdfsbi,Gorill_a,Lights All Night Long by Lydia Fitzpatrick,"Hey all, it has been awhile. In April 2018 I graduated after eight slow years in undergrad (eventually switching majors and obtaining an English degree). Once I had graduated and started to work more and more hours, I was only finding time to read right before I feel asleep. Nothing was holding my interest. So I put reading aside and didn't read anything for almost a year.

Eventually I decided ""I'll just pick up some random mystery thriller type novel and give it a read."" So I ordered Harlan Coben's ""Run Away"" and FLEW though it. Reading was fun. From there I moved to Malcolm Gladwell's new book ""Talking to Strangers""- which I devoured. And most recently, I finished **Lights All Night Long** by Lydia Fitzpatrick. It was absolutely beautiful. It gave me everything in a book that I missed from class (I still miss class discussion...). The story was artfully composed, deeply sad, hopeful, and thought provoking. It was the first book that I has made me cry in years.

I could not find any discussion on this book in the sub and thought I should mention it. Has anyone read it? and as a side question- is there anyone here that grew up in Russia in the 90s/00s willing to share how their experience may have aligned with the novel?

fdem9s,iwilde9,"""I think it's interesting that..."" is a poor way to start comments about books.","Apologies if this isn't quite the place to post this, but it's something that's been on my mind recently. TL;DR at bottom.

As an English major in college, I spend much of my time discussing books with my classes (an experience I'm sure is very analogous to a book club). Nearly every comment by a student, across classes, grades, and backgrounds, is prefaced by the phrase, ""I think it's interesting that.""

One of my first disagreements with this phrase is that it is an example of how people feel they need to justify their contribution. You shouldn't feel afraid to express your opinion, you don't need to have a specific reason to say something. If there's something on your mind, you should say it. Rather than saying, ""I found the conch shell in *Lord of the Flies* interesting because it symbolizes society,"" people should feel confident enough to simply say, as though they were writing an essay, ""The conch shell symbolizes society.""

Two, it leads to discussions that are simply pointing out interesting things without forming opinions on them. Discussions of books in which people simply reminisce about the best parts are a lot of fun, don't get me wrong. But they're not productive. Rather than simply pointing out the symbol of the conch shell, a comment about what that *means* and *why* its important would spark a deeper conversation. 

Three, people use the word interesting without interrogating what makes something interesting. Honestly, just thinking about why one thing is more interesting than another is a fascinating point of discussion. But we toss the word interesting around as though it had a specific definition when it comes to literary criticism when it really doesn't. Saying something like, ""This was interesting to me"" and then delving into the linguistic construction that the author uses to make it interesting could be really cool, and it's such wasted potential. 

Four, it's so repetitive. I've run out of like actual substantive arguments and now I'm just complaining, so you can skip this part. But *everyone* starts their comments like this. Even people who I regard with the highest respect, people who I think are crazy intelligent. And it's always with the same artificial tone of voice, the kind that trails up into a question at the end of a sentence. Be definitive, people!

TL:DR: Saying ""I think it's interesting that..."" leads to less productive discussions and it's infuriating to have to listen to people start their comments this way over and over. 

Haha sorry for the rant, this is such a small thing but it's been increasingly bothering me lately. I don't mean to call people out with this post, I start my comments with ""I think it's interesting..."" unless I consciously decide not too. And honestly, a lot of haha interesting haha comments get made that start with, ""I think it's interesting."" There are better ways to express yourself, and you should never feel the need to justify your contribution to a discussion.",17,1583335834,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fdem9s/i_think_its_interesting_that_is_a_poor_way_to/,books,1
fdej6l,StoryMaking_Bitch,Help me choose a story to make because I don't know which to make.,"So. I want to make a story because gay book is not much out there and I want to be proud. So... Help. I will tell you guys part of the stories and you guys will choose one. And if I could I will post it here or in wattpad idk. P. S not all part of the book will be about the gym couple. So... 

1. The Phoenix Wrath. 
A girl name Evelyn Harp was living as a lab rat for 6 years for a certain virus. The virus would kill a certain individual, and if you survived. You will be put into a very deep surveillance. She was one of the 2000 people out of hundred thousand they experimented. They succeed and the virus broke out making one of the first time people died as much as the kill count of Hitler domination. 

A certain attacked happen making the scientists have no other choice but to kill every single of of them... Out of 2000 people... There's only 5 survivor. Blah blah, years past and everything. (Sorry I'm a little lazy.) She was adopted and was living her normal life. Until she was attack and her only family was killed right in front of her own eyes. When the virus broke out, there's a certain people who get a power awakening inside of them. 

They have a collar on their neck to stopped them from going crazy. She was framed for her father death and swear to the God until she died she will find them and kill every single one of them. But first she need to find some help from a certain group of people. 

2. Demonic life. 
Ryan Anderson (maybe would change the name) was living under the same roof under his grandfather almost all his life since his parent die at a very early age. But he's grandpa would never let him near the attic. There's a stair up to the attic but it was always locked. 

Everytime he asked his grandfather why, he would ignored him saying something ridiculous or something. But as time passes he seems to forget about the attic. Until his grandfather die, he inherited his whole fortune. Since he own a cafe nearby, he wanted to move in to his grandfather house. That was when he accidentally made a pact with Archduke J. A huge douchebag and a salty son of a bitch bastard. 

He grant Ryan 1 wish. He could choose anything he want, but after the wish is granted. He will take his soul down to hell with him. He never thought about it so he keep the wish and never wished about anything, until he a black monster attacked him in the dead night. ""Oh. Did I forgot to tell you? The longer you make a pact with the devil. The more of the Grim little bastard chasing after you."" 

3. Princess Quest. 
Just like the tittle, this time a princess kingdom was cursed and she was the only survivor. With no other thing then the god words that was bestowed to her. She begin her journey to the dark forest to meet the Dark magician to help him. The problem is? His first companions for this quest is a thief who decided that helping her get to the dark forest is an easy money. 

When she able to find him, ""I need your help—"" He cut her words off. ""No. Find someone else."" A princess trying to break the curse of a mighty dragon god and his only hope for it is a man who only sit on a chair, leg crossed while sipping his tea and flipping his book.

It's a compelling image, but more than that, it seems familiar to me. I'm fairly certain I've seen it before. But I can't remember where. 

Searching Google, Amazon, and Goodreads proved fruitless. None of the books titled ""Masquerade"" seem to be even close. My best guess is that this is a non-US bookstore and that ""Masquerade"" was published under a different title in Western markets. Googling the name of the bookstore (""Book-off"") reveals that it's a major Japanese bookseller, so that seems to bear the theory out.

My next stop was to search Amazon Japan as well as Book Depository, but no luck there, either. So I turn to you.

The only other clue I have to offer is that, if properly alphabetized on the shelf, the author's name is between Kibler and King.

The delirious questions about the ducks and what happens to them in winter time.I feel like some more than others have an inherent personality flaws that lead them to be in a similar situation where they are alone and not entirely integrated with their environments and life. Maybe it was loss that started it, maybe Holden looked at himself and had an epiphany about how life truly is and how he can’t be hypocritical by just letting things go, moving on, putting a show because the show must go on.

fddowz,WadeEffingWilson,"In Burning Chrome and The Sprawl trilogy, is Rikki Wildside supposed to be Molly Millions?","I finished Burning Chrome (story and book) yesterday and I was immediately hit with the realization that Rikki Wildside (Bobby Quine &amp; Automatic Jack's love interest) could very well have been a young Molly Millions.

I started with Neuromancer and then went straight to Burning Chrome but I haven't finished Count Zero yet--still at the beginning with that one. So, if what I'm asking is explained later, just let me know please.

It's understood that the events in the short story Burning Chrome occur way before the events in Neuromancer, so Molly would be younger. She was obsessed with getting the Zeiss Ikon eye implants even though she couldn't afford them, whereas Molly has mirrored eye implants. Rikki is a meat puppet, same as Molly was.

Was Rikki supposed to be the backstory provided for Molly? She is very much a reoccurring character so it stands to reason that there would be an explanation of her past. What doesn't make much sense is that so far, it's not been explicitly stated that they are (or are not) the same character.

Speaking of which, what was Rikki's actual involvement with taking out Chrome? At the end of the story, it's revealed that she walks through an ""Employees Only"" door. Does that mean that she was an employee there or that she used the ongoing distraction to slip in and physically take care of Chrome? Was she the one that maybe hinted to Bobby about targeting Chrome? If so, what was her motivated and her end game? If it was a hostile takeover, Rikki would have stayed rather than fleeing to Chiba City, right?

LOL, sorry about jamming this post full, I have absolutely loved reading Gibson's works so far and I'd love to discuss it with others. Some of it may be speculation and theory but I also would like to hear facts, if available.

fda3u7,Ivy_Hands,"Just finished reading ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" and, oh my god! it's really that good.","I am a fan of Sherlock Holmes and I wanted to read some books which had a similar kind of character i.e. ""a genius detective"" and that's how I came across Hercule Poirot.

Though Hercule Poirot as a character in my opinion is not as great as Sherlock but I'd be lying if I said Agatha Christie is not a great writer.

This book in particular is a masterclass on how to write a great detective novel. The ending is very vital in writing any piece of fiction and Christie has a knack for doing just that and in this particular case I think she has outdone herself.

The last chapter of this book was my favourite and I think it was hauntingly beautiful. Definitely the best Christie book I have read till date.",12,1583310724,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fda3u7/just_finished_reading_the_murder_of_roger_ackroyd/,books,1

fd8b82,ToBeContinuedYes,Why I think Rick Riordan is a terrible author.,"Note: the following observations are based on the first 10 books from the camp half blood mega series.

Atrocious character writing, with informed flaws, bland project-onto-able leads, stereotypical side characters, and the arcs of the leads are either a: ""learns to be more self-confident"" or b: what are arcs? 

A fixation on his character's diversity to an annoying degree. The native American who recalls the stories of her people, the African American who went to the school for coloured children, the Hispanic who speaks Spanish, the Chinese guy with a ""wise Chinese Grandma"" who tells him of their family legend, the gay guy who's story involves him coming out... And that from hoo alone. (It somehow gets worse in MC.) While having a diverse cast is probably the only unambiguously good part of his (later, since this all happens after the universally white straight pjo) works, diversity in writing should be a minor detail, certainly never a major part of a character in a story that is at heart a YA escapist fantasy and not billed or framed as a story about LGBT+ struggles or race relations. Casting lgbt people or racial minorites as going through struggles specifically related to their diversity does the exact opposite of what a diverse cast should do: normalize. It should show that minorites are just like anyone else, which means they go through things any straight white cis character would.

Actual prose. People who aren't funny shouldn't try to be, and Rick Riordan is living proof. His kids are the only people under 26 he's ever spoken to, and it shows. His prosaic style was what taught many a genZer the true meaning of cringe.

Worldbuilding so horrendous it defies logic. Did I mention that we're supposed to sympathize with the literal fathers of the Confederacy and Hitler? Also, series mythologies should never be mapped onto human history, given that history is basically a long series of moral blacks and greys during which nobody really comes across as completely sympathetic apart from, like, toussaint louverture.

Incest. tons of it. Our-oh-so-sympathetic leads are certified cousinf¥¢√€®$. I don't care if they ""aren't related by dna"", that's some anime-level bull. (Also, again, it somehow gets worse in Magnus Chase.)

Stakes: tension and stakes come from the possibility of loss. The possibility of loss is best instilled by displaying a willingness to not have everything work out. In action series where the stakes are life-and-death, a good display of willingness to kill will serve to raise stakes, and thus tension. See JoJo's bizzare adventure and A song of ice and fire for this done well. However, in a series with 17 (Percy, Frank, Annabeth, Jason, Hazel, Piper, Leo, Thalia, Nico, Tyson, Grover, Rachel, Chiron, Clarisse, Zoe, Reyna, Hedge.) supposedly sympathetic characters with significant screentime who the writing at least tries to make us not want to see die, exactly &gt;!one dies. One. Zoe Nightshade.!&lt; What. A. Tragedy.

fd70rc,thadwdavis,The Gods Themselves: A Loose Theory,"I'm sure I'm not the first person to talk about this, but I just finished the book and I had an inkling of a thought about halfway through the book that blossomed into something larger as it continued. Is it possible that the para-universe and the cosmeg universe are just our universe at different times?

In reading the second section, I don't know exactly why, I started thinking that maybe this was actually just the future of our universe and of humanity. At that point I thought maybe humanity used the power from the electron pump to develop feasible space travel and had made it out of our solar system before the sun exploded, found a place they could find some semblance of life with a smaller star and over millions and millions of years (billions maybe? I don't know) evolved into what we saw in the book with the strong atomic force having been altered. 

When I got to the third section, things filled in a little more. There's genetic engineering to create intuitionism which could be what ultimately led to the triads. Intuitionism felt really similar to what Dua could do as an emotional. They live in caverns on the moon just as the aliens in the para-universe live in caverns, with Neville (who I believe would have been a leader in colonies that left the moon) even having an aversion to going to the surface. There was also the discussion about the number two being absurd. It's either one universe or an infinite number of them. We're led to believe the proper assumption is the infinite, but we've also seen in this book that initial assumptions aren't necessarily trustworthy.

So if this were correct, and I'm sure it has a lot of holes and not much ground to actually stand on, it would mean they weren't breaching another universe but actually breaching through time and that our universe started out as a cosmic egg with a rather weak strong force. Then, due to Denison and Selene's work on the cosmeg pump, it becomes more intense and causes the big bang. Neville and his group of people who wanted to leave the moon do so and travel the stars until they find a planet to settle on in it's caverns. They also take up genetic engineering once more. When the big bang happens, it would cause the cosmeg pumps to stop allowing the electron pump to continue intensifying the strong force. As Neville's colony keeps up their genetic engineering experiments, they eventually create three distinct types of person and then develop it further to have them merge together into one, eventually creating the soft one/hard one dichotomy.

I'm not usually one to make big fan theories or anything like that, but I couldn't get it out of my head that these connections were there however loose they may be. But hey, maybe I just decided ahead of time that this was the truth, and I can't accept anything else now.",0,1583293177,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fd70rc/the_gods_themselves_a_loose_theory/,books,1

fd4byh,elizabethdschultz,Five Great Tips on How to Illustrate a Children’s Book," [Gabriella Eva Nagy](https://www.reflectionorg.com/author/) is both an author and an illustrator whose book entitled [*Enchanted Rainbows*](https://www.amazon.com/Enchanted-Rainbows-Gabriella-Eva-Nagy/dp/1612446922)greatly showcases the unmatched power of colors and illustrations in    stimulating creativity. Indeed, illustrations are a necessary element  of   books, most especially children’s books. Without illustrations,    children will find it hard to read through a book because they have    shorter attention spans compared to adults. A book with mere texts will    less likely spark their interest than a book filled with colorful    illustrations.

Therefore, aside   from authors,  illustrators are also very much needed in children’s   literature.  Illustrators are essentially artists who specialize in   explicating  literary concepts by providing visual representations that   correspond to  the content of the associated books. In other words, the   main job of  illustrators is to clarify the intricate concepts and  ideas  that are  quite difficult to describe textually.

If   you are one of those budding artists  who aspire to become an   illustrator for children’s books, then this  article is right for you.   Briefly discussed below are five great tips on how to illustrate a children’s book. 

1. **Sketch your ideas**
2. **Look at references**
3. **Map the story**
4. **Create thumbnails**
5. **Prepare a color sample**

Netflix is a major consumer of my time. Yet I dont feel any value from it. All I do is watch.. the information I draw in is useless and the same experience as anyone else.

I would really really like to read a book, but I never manage. I get to maybe 1 chapter and I give up. Or I stop for the day and tell myself I'll read more tomorrow and I never do... I always go back to the phone or the console or the TV.

I want to be able to use my imagination more for the information I am being educated or entertained by. And that can be done by reading words from a book.

And the reason why I want to do this is because I want to learn not only how to focus on reading but possibly learn how to focus on general life, such as tasks, work, outgoings, play time with my children, spending time with the wife.

I DESPISE myself for wanting to pick up my fucking phone to look at useless shit and getting frustrated that I cant because my daughter of 2 years is grabbing my hand desperate for me to spend time with her and give her my full attention. I fucking hate myself for that.

I want it to stop. Does anyone have any tips or can direct me on how to spend my free time 100% dedicated to reading books and nothing else. No phones. No TV. No internet. No news. No magazines. No audiobooks on a device such as a phone. Just words on paper and no comic books.",5,1583277962,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fd3mab/how_do_i_learn_to_focus_on_reading/,books,1

This has never happened to me before so I guess I am asking two questions here:

1 - Have you experienced this and how did you get over it?

 2 - What book did you read that gave you a book hangover?

Hoping this is the right sub for this. I’m in a bit of a pickle. 

I’m on vacation so naturally I’m reading Harry Potter, in this case book 7. It was in my pack earlier and we all went hiking yesterday, left my pack in the car. We turn back up a few hours later and some fool broke into our car and stole our packs.

A few police reports and hours later the cops find our packs. They were dumped in a dumpster. So we go to the PD this morning and sure enough they have our stuff. Cool beans.

Problem is my book now smells like weed. Normally I would toss the book and buy another copy but this is a first edition, first printing, Bloomsbury copy in nearly pristine condition. I’d like to keep it if at all possible, since it goes nicely with my collection.

I am 16 and like all 16 year olds i am forced to read a classical book by my serbian teacher (i am serbian, so its like a english teacher for someone from england). I enjoy reading books, but i don't read books to gain knowledge or pretend like i belong to some elite group, i just read books that are interesting because they are interesting. But this book, this is the least interesting thing i have ever attempted to read! I cannot explain how utterly boring it is to me. I read epic fantasy, i love dark stuff like asoiaf, first law, witcher etc, the dark tone of the book is alright, my problem with this book is just how boring it is. I couldn't care less about any of these people, i have only read some 29 pages but i just can't continue anymore, its just so boring. I am going to give up on reading this, its a major waste of time and energy and all it does is make me feel grumpy. I can stand a depressing book, i can stand a classic, i can stand a book about a different time period, but one thing i can't stand is a utterly boring book that i would never read in a million years if i was not forced to do it. I am just going to do what everyone does and fake that i read this and instead just read about it online. Still i feel really disappointed and upset about this, i want to be a fantasy writer one day which is ironic since here i am complaining about having to read a well liked classic. Maybe my attention span is just too low, i dont know, but all i know is that i am never touching this book again my life.

No matter the headaches. I can’t help it. I need to be able to read through it fluently and without pause. 

Not reading Joyce was basically a sin in my family. Irish Pride you know? Well. American born Irish pride. ANYWAY. Joyce. I’ve read it all. Pretty much no issue. Except for Finnegans Wake.

I understand a lot of it due to my grandparents and my great-grandparents, but the usage and flow varies from what I’m used to and even though you get a feel for it in his other works?

There’s just something about Finnegans Wake my brain refuses to wrap itself around. It’s such a difficult read. People harp on Ulysses and call it hard to read and it’s even been banned in some places, which it actually is, but for completely different reasons. Like compared to Finnegans Wake, actually reading Ulysses is a breeze. The subject matter not so much, but the read itself is simple when compared to FW.

fczwxm,henrique_gj,"Today I finished reading The Gates of Rome, by Conn Iggulden. Here's why I didn't like it.","_FOA, english is not my native language. I apologize for my broken english._

**The first problem** is the unnecessary historical inaccuracy. I know it's not a problem per se, after all, little is known about the early life of Julius Caesar. But the author has changed even what **is** known and what did not **need** to be changed, for example, the kinship of the characters and their positions. (examples at the end)

**The second problem** is that the story is slow paced, and some parts are irrelevant, having no future impact, turning the book boring sometimes.

**The third problem** is that the story is too simple. Some characters and their relationships are too simple. But principaly for me, the politics are too simple. The politics are so important for the roman history that it **should** have been better explored. The book would have been better for me if that aspect had been dealt with in greater depth.

The civil war between Marius and Sulla was almost entirely fictional. Iggulden changed the location, the duration and the history of the war, as well as how and when some deaths happened and the attribution of some achievements. I understand the reason to some of this changings but some I just want to know why.

Why is Mithridates referred to as the king of Greece who rebelled against Roman rule if, in real history, he was king of Pontus, which had never been subject to Rome? The Second Mithridatic War really happened in real life, in the same period, with the same people. Telling the real reason would certainly not be a problem for the narrative.

An historical fiction can be a funny way of learning a bit about history, but not with this amount of inaccuracy, and apparently sometimes the accuracy in this book was sacrificed for just no reason.

fczonp,suomynona_esuom,Even Agatha Christie can be predictive if you read enough of her books,"This sub loves Agatha Christie, as do I. I began the journey of reading all her books in high school - I've read most of her books, sadly I was not able to complete all, including 5 of her books under the pen name Mary Westmacott ( I had read *Absent In The Spring*, and found it depressing at the time. On hindsight it's a really good book that places you in the mind of the protagonist so well, even the insensitive high school me was depressed by it). After reading quite a number of her books you begin to see well used plot patterns - &gt;!the husband/wife/unknown wife/fake wife!&lt; plot for one (Third Girl, Body in the Library, Dead Man's Folly are ones I remember) some variation of &gt;!""it wasn't her""!&lt; for another (Peril at End House, Third Girl again). My memory's very rusty, but there were many such repeated plots that made her books predictable after my 30th or so Agatha Christie books.


I still do enjoy her books; I wasn't able to predict the exact mechanism, but there was a lingering suspicion that such a ploy was employed, or that &gt;!the two unlikely (or rather, most likely) people are married!&lt;. It is to be expected though, with such a large bibliography.


My most memorable of her books are the subs favourites - *The Mysterious Affairs at Styles, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Murder in the Orient Express, And Then There Were None* + some others - *Crooked House, Endless Night, Hercule Poirot's Christmas* (It's been a long time I've forgotten most of what I've read). Her short story collections are a *must* read. *Parker Pyne Investigates* is my personal favourite. Also worth mentioning is *The Labours of Hercules*. You should just read them all! I actually did *not* like *The A.B.C Murders*, I was disappointed by it for some reason, because the premise seemed so exciting. Oh well, it's a personal thing.


The author I read before Agatha Christie was Enid Blyton; I enjoyed her books as a kid, but even at that age, I had problems with it - 1) the racism + elitism (considering Enid Blyton was born *after* Agatha Christie...she *was* inexcusably racist, whereas I didn't find any malice from Agatha, even with a book called Ten Little N*ggers. Blyton always portrayed the English characters as the perfect models - the ""slutty"" American, the ""dishonest"" French girl, the ""wild"" Spanish (?) girl. As an Indian myself I remember being mildly offended by some of her portrayals, though I don't remember what exactly it was. 2) her stories were too similar to each other. Considering she has written - I don't exactly know how many - but a LOT of books, it's inevitable; but I still think there should've been a bit more originality

Anyway, I digress. I'm terrible at conclusions so thank you for listening to me ramble.",11,1583262749,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fczonp/even_agatha_christie_can_be_predictive_if_you/,books,1

One suggestion might be to leave your phone on the other side of the room. That way, you won't be tempted to get it out and check your messages.

This book series was based in a newly made city in the middle of Australia. This main boy moves to the city after his mom gets her dream job after getting a divorce from his dad. They move there and there is something weird about the place as even though it is full of people they are all strange. It is about a 7 or 6 book series and is told from multiple people's perspective. So this is where my memory fails me and all I now remember is that one or 2 of the kids can time travel into the past and maybe slow down time?. So the leaders of the city try to stop this kid from finding out something that they have been lying about and there is a team of them and they tell everyone and they hideout in this weird bunker with the ground people, where they find out what has been happening. Then the father of the original kid saves them and that is all I can remember.

Also the books had really bright colors with black in them in the cover. No its not 'GONE' series or 'UNWIND'

Please help me find this book as I want to recommend to my siblings.

fcs7qi,-_MD_-,Where the fun fiction begins,"Hi,

I have a philosophical question for all book worms. But I guess that may be applied to any type of content.

I recently finished a book series and all that's left is a lot of fan fiction. I always avoided fan fiction. Because I am scared that I forgot which part of the story is canon and which is fun fiction and it will skew my view of characters etc...

But then I thought what exactly is fun fiction?

I thought about massive universes like star wars or warcraft made from many books from many authors. Sometimes the same characters and their stories told by different authors. 

Every movie/series adaptation is basically fan fiction because it's someone's interpretation of the source.


If you write fan fiction and it's somehow acknowledged by the author as canon it's still just fan fiction that was acknowledged. If you didn't write it wouldn't exist. Possible character development would never occur.

Who told the story and shapes the characters? The author comes up with them? But what if there are multiple authors? Their collective agreement?

How do you define what is and what isn't a fan fiction?",6,1583228128,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcs7qi/where_the_fun_fiction_begins/,books,1

Does the fog affect Wistan and Gawain less than others?
I think it does, they seem to remember more than others do, or they think that they do. After slaying Querig I didn't get much information about Wistans memory.

Am I using it wrong? The only option I see to sort quotes is tags, but it seems I can't add my own and the preexisting ones range from unhelpful to ridiculous.

The thing that actually bothers me is that when I want to see my quotes for a specific book, I have to find the name of the book in the Quotes section and click on it, not just go to the main page for the book. So go on goodreads -&gt; click on my quotes -&gt; sort through and find a quote from that book -&gt; click on the name of the book underneath -&gt; voila.

fcqn14,jhgraves1,A Youth Concerned with Society’s Lack of Love for Reading,"So, some backstory. Recently I read and loved “The Goldfinch” by Donna Tartt. It is now considered my favorite book and I constantly craved for someone to discuss it with. I recommended it to everyone in my social circle at my high school, at which I am a senior. To my dismay, I realized that my classmates, who don’t even read 300 page books, would not pick up a nearly 800 page one. The only person I could talk to about this book was my sophomore World Civilizations teacher who constantly recommends me books to read. Discussions with him are great, for sure, but I often find myself longing for interactions with my peers about this art form that I love so much. 

I just wish people my age would read more. I understand that high schoolers are becoming more and more stressed, but reading actually helps me with said stress. I used to be a victim of the absence of reading. Last year alone I only read 12 books. In the month of February this year, I read 10. Reading has greatly improved my mental health and has made the later part of my senior year so much enjoyable. 

So this is my quick rant / food for thought about the absence of desire to read within today’s society, or rather the society of teenagers. What can we do to further encourage youth to read? I’d love to find out. 

Since you’re here, feel free to check out my YouTube account where I share my love for literature.

fcqlhc,seattlecoffeedonut,Questions after finishing East of Eden (spoilers),"I finally finished East of Eden, and my god it was a beautiful read.
But like Grapes of Wrath, I had a little trouble understanding the implied meanings of some of the passages.
If anyone could help me with these questions, I would appreciate it very much!


1. When Lee talks about his parents and how his mother died, did the men take care of Lee as though he was their own son after the brutal rape and murder? The phrase ""dreadful beauty"" seemed to imply that.


2. pg251 ""Kate was haggard and her slender body had shrunk to bones. The girls tried to spell her with Faye, but Kate would not leave."" 
I'd never seen the word spell used like this, so I looked it up. It CAN mean 'rest' or 'relieve'. So I guess the girls tried to make Kate rest with Faye since they were both sick? (due to Kate's poisoning) Am I reading this right?


3. When Liz lends a Bible to Samuel for the twins' names, she says ""She(Liz's mother) wouldn't mind. And all the names but one in here have two dates."" What does this mean? That all names except one have already been taken twice?


4. Tom receives the notice of his father's death. Upon opening the telegram, he reads the ""inevitable four words"". I thought about what these could be, ""We regret to inform"" ""I am sorry to say..?"". Is it just ""Samuel Hamilton is dead/has passed""?


5. End of chapter 26, when Lee is talking about leaving the Trask household over tea with Adam, he says he would like to go to Salinas tomorrow. Then Adam says ""Do anything you want, God knows you've done enough for me."" To which Lee replies ""I want to scatter devil papers. I want to put a little roast pig on the grave of my father.""

Then ""Adam got up quickly and knocked over his cup and went outside and left Lee sitting there"". The chapter ends there. I wasn't sure why the chapter ended on such a sentence. Was Adam upset at Lee's decision to leave him and his twins?


6. And I think I got this one and that it was explained later in the book, but just to be sure I'll ask. ""Cal started fiercely at his brother, at the pale hair and the wide-set eyes, and suddenly he knew why his father loved Aron, knew it beyond doubt."" It's because Aron resembles Cathy, right?


Thanks for reading the long post. I was really curious about these, and didn't have anyone to ask.",3,1583217205,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcqlhc/questions_after_finishing_east_of_eden_spoilers/,books,1

Hey guys, as the title states, I am currently trying to remember the name of a book series from my childhood. It was a young adult fantasy series written sometime in the 2010s and maybe the 2000s. The general plot of the series was that there was a warrior queen that had to unite a bunch of fantasy creatures against an invading empire that was more modernized and didn’t believe these creatures existed(I remember that cannons were a big thing with the main antagonist). The warrior queen marries a warlock / wizard (I forget the specification). They had kids that had ginger hair and their daughter that was gifted with magic became an antagonist later in the series. Those are pretty much the main plot points I can remember.

fcprs7,Crawgdor,Read Paradise Lost Outloud or listen to an audiobook.,"Paradise lost is one of my favorite works, the only way I can really get into it is to read it aloud and let it wash over me. If you get too bogged down in the details you lose the music of it and it becomes a chore instead of a pleasure.

My son is 3 and a half and for the last while I’ve been reading it to him last thing before bed(after one or two of his books and a song). He asks for it now, and seems to really enjoy it, or at least enjoys staying awake a while longer.

We just finished the first book and I needed to share. I read a lot, I read classics, novels, biographies, poetry even scripture from different traditions. 

There is nothing else I have found as transcendent as this work. It’s a sublime work of genius by a blind poet of Homers stature written in our own native tongue. I seem drawn to revisit it every few years, and don’t read it all at once but slowly make my way through, a little at a time, over the course of a few months. This is my third time through it and as I age and revisit I only find more depth and beauty.",7,1583212655,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcprs7/read_paradise_lost_outloud_or_listen_to_an/,books,1

fcop7u,smallbasket,I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream...Wasn't Amazing,"""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"" is recommended in practically every ""What's the scariest book you've read?"" thread. I finally read it today and was so excited because Reddit praises how amazing and scary it is, but I was actually really disappointed. 

I used to read a lot of those ""Best Horror of 2010"" (or whatever year) anthologies, which are so much fun and introduced me to a lot of new authors. Sometimes you find gems in those collections, but a lot of time the writing is meh, the ideas almost work but not quite. Regardless, they're entertaining and a joy to read. That's how I feel about I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. 

The writing really wasn't that great. It wasn't bad, it felt like something an average high-school student could have produced. I think Ellison uses too many adjectives and ""tells"" more than ""shows"". One example of that is Ted's claim that the others hate him. I saw no evidence of that, so it felt extra. Why add into the story that the others hate him when you could just say that Ted was the least affected by AM? It felt like an unnecessary detail that we were told, but never shown.

Okay, but not every story's strength is the writing. Sometimes it's the ideas and plot that really drive the story and mask less-than-great writing. In this story, the plot concept is interesting and novel, especially for its time. However, there were a lot of things that just didn't make sense in this story and I don't feel that the overall concept was able to compensate for the lesser quality writing. For example, the computer somehow kept these people from aging and committing suicide. I know that Ted has no idea how it's going on, so we can't really know, but it was just too unbelievable for me. The whole story felt like those games you played as a kid with your siblings where you would say things like, ""A sword appeared in my hand just now, but not yours. Oh, and the berries I just ate gave me super strength, but they're all gone! None for you."" It just doesn't make sense and somehow always works out the way you want. 

I also didn't understand how the computer was creating these seemingly flesh and blood creatures (dead body in the beginning and mythical-type creature in the middle), unless they are just holograms, or maybe the computer is making everyone hallucinate at once? But that was another issue I had with the story....how could the AI get into their mind?  How could it produce sounds/smells/tastes/experiences/items and food out of thin air? None of this is explained or believable.

Ted's internal monologue as he learns why the AI tortures them - ""We created him to think, but there was nothing it could do with that creativity..."" carried the entire story, in my opinion. It felt like Ellison just wanted to put that monologue/idea out there, but needed to make up a story to go with it so he created this story, but didn't care too much about the details.

The large hairy creature could have been replaced with anything else, or even removed from the story, and the story wouldn't have changed. The part about how they hate Ted could have been removed, and the story would continue on the exact same. The multiple descriptions about how they were in the belly of the earth/AM could have been condensed into one, or even removed completely and I think everyone still would have had that imagery in their mind (because he told us how the computers were developed underground during the war). 

This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy this story because I DID enjoy this story, I just don't understand why it's so praised on Reddit. If I had discovered this story in a horror or sci-fi compilation I wouldn't have  made this long-ass post dissecting it, because it just would have been entertaining and then I would have forgotten about it. I expected it to be amazing but it was just fine. I haven't seen anyone else here criticize it ... am I missing something? If you love this story, why?",18,1583207253,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcop7u/i_have_no_mouth_and_i_must_screamwasnt_amazing/,books,1

We are now trying to decide what the next book or series will be, and quite honestly we just realized both of our collections have a majority of white male authors.  I think both of us would love to diversify a bit, and need some suggestions.  We are looking for something a bit light and fun, fantasy is always great but willing to branch out.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a children's or young adult book, since she doesn't understand words really yet, but something that isn't too adult.

fcl629,burgthebeast,"Chapter 15, To Kill a Mockingbird","This chapter is where I think this book separates itself from the rest and sets itself as one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written. 

My english isn't elegant enough to summarise the beauty and sheer genius of Harper Lee but I just wanted to make a few points on why this is my favourite chapter of all time in any book.

This is the chapter where the men come to lynch Tom Robinson in the night, and Atticus is sat waiting by his cell. It has you on the edge of your seat the whole way through, makes you genuinely worried about the safety of not only a 50 year old man trying to do the right thing, but also his young innocent kids who happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.

For the first time ever, we see fear in Atticus when he realises both his kids have suddenly followed him to what is probably the most dangerous situation he has ever been in in his life, to the point where he pleads them to just go home. You can feel the fear of a Dad for his kids and described through the eyes of a 6 year old girl gives it a sickeningly comic aspect of a real grave situation.

But the thing that tops it all of: Jem. Jeremy Atticus Finch you bloody legend. The night the boy becomes a man, his rite of passage, the first time he flat out disobeys Atticus and takes a stand. Scout's innocent description of the whole situation, with Jem standing face to face with Atticus, and her noticing that there was no physical resemblance between them, yet how they both looked one and the same. This is the first time you really see the impact of Atticus's parenting methods, the fact that Jem chooses individual thought over conventional wisdom, the fact he says do what you want I ain't going home, the fact that he understands the gravity of the situation.

Then Scout herself, seeing Walter Cunningham and giving him a lecture on entailments. Talking about his kid and how she beat him up but also invited him to dinner and how she wanted Mr Cunnigham to say hi to him from her. 

I'm getting lost just trying to articulate all this in an elegant manner but would be really interested in other people's thoughts on this particular chapter.

fckxef,pie640,2/3 into Perdido Street Station,"1. I know there are plenty of threads about this book already but I feel like I have enough fresh things to say to make a new thread.  

2. I first wanted to check out this book because I'm getting into Weird Fiction, the subgenre of horror that starts from Lovecraft through Ligotti to Caitlin R. Kiernan. This novel is considered a giant in the genre but I'm a bit disappointed that it doesn't seem to have much in common with that line of authors. There are a couple Lovecraftian monsters but everything else just doesn't feel like those authors mentioned above. A little more research tells me this is part of the New Weird subgenre which is different than Classic (or ""Modern Classic"") Weird Fiction. It's not bad I got something different than what I expected but people gotta explain the subsubgenre differences.    

3. People talk about the prose like it's dense and poetic and filled with antiquated words as in Lovecraft's writing, but it's pretty standard IMO. Every once in a while Mieville will throw in an obscure word but it's nowhere near as complex or idiosyncratic as Lovecraft or a certain other author whose name is similar to Mieville's.     

4. People complain about the plot taking 300 pages to kick in but I enjoy the beginning of the book more than the parts I'm reading now. This is a very interesting world. The strange elements are given time to be explained and when they're settled in they feel organic. Every chapter gives you a new area of New Crobuzon to explore and does add a little something to the plot. I don't mind following these characters' daily lives and learning more about this society at a leisurely pace.     

5. TBH I'm starting to lose interest now that the plot has turned into &gt;!psychic vampire moth hunters!&lt;. It's a bit disappointing that such an unconventional world is at the service of a conventional plot. I dunno if this is what the entire novel is revolving around but it feels like this is the main conflict. It's not like it came out of nowhere but I would have expected something more based on the political or social themes which seems to have taken a backseat at this point of the story.        

6. &gt;!Introducing a character, giving him no real personality, and then killing him off, is a real cheap trick to add a gruesome death to the story. I guess it's supposed to be tongue-in-cheek because he's known only by Mr. X, but there's not a lot else in the novel that's so wink-wink.!&lt;    

7. A lot of people say The Scar is a lot better. Is it? What about the third book in the trilogy?",11,1583190650,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fckxef/23_into_perdido_street_station/,books,1

fck7za,SocialSoundSystem,"""The price of self-destiny is never cheap, and in certain situations it is unthinkable. But to achieve the marvelous, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought."" - Tom Robbins, Jitterbug Perfume","Tom Robbins is one of my favorite authors. I looked up this quote in my physical copy earlier today while I was pondering life and the world (read: politics) and came to realize that it's generally misquoted as:

&gt;“To achieve the ***impossible***, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought.”

Full Quote:
&gt;“If you lack the iron and the fuzz to take control of your own life, if you insist on leaving your fate to the gods, then the gods will repay your weakness by having a grin or two at your expense. Should you fail to pilot your own ship, don't be surprised at what inappropriate port you find yourself docked. The dull and prosaic will be granted adventures that will dice their central nervous systems like an onion, romantic dreamers will end up in the rope yard. You may protest that it is too much to ask of an uneducated fifteen-year-old girl that she defy her family, her society, her weighty cultural and religious heritage in order to pursue a dream that she doesn't really understand. Of course it is asking too much. The price of self-destiny is never cheap, and in certain situations it is unthinkable. But to achieve the marvelous, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought.”

The trailer has nothing to do with the book I read and loved years ago. I mean the coolest thing about it is, that Artemis is a 12 year old cold-blooded villain. The movie just looks like a bad disney mix of spy kids and Men in Black where ""Artemis"" (the boy from the movie has basically nothing common with book-Artemis) works together with the characters he fought in the book. 
After the terrible eragon and Percy Jackson films, Artemis Fowl is just another great young adult book that got completely screwed by the movie industry.

fcj07t,TheFlyingFoodTestee,"The ""Arc of a Scythe"" series (or why some books should remain one-offs)","Last year I stumbled across *Scythe* by Neal Shusterman and, finding the premise interesting, decided to read it. Finding myself pleasantly surprised by the quality, I decided to try the sequel. Now, having read the final book in the trilogy, I am more convinced of the notion that I  started to develop while reading the second book.

  
Some books should just stay one-offs.

  
This is not to say that the rest of the series is *bad*, so to speak. It's actually pretty good. The characters are decently fleshed out. The worldbuilding, while not great, is certainly solid. And the plot(s) and themes that run throughout the novels are much more ambitious and interesting than a lot of other entries into the YA field. 

  
But ultimately, because of either Shusterman's writing skills or the fact that it is a YA trilogy, but the sequels never quite managed to hit the epicness (for want of a better word) that it aspired to. The worldbuilding, while never collapsing on itself, nevertheless did begin to feel a bit stretched out. And themes, though interesting, were at times belabored and unsubtle.

  
These issues were exacerbated because (in my opinion) the first book was such a well-contained book. The story could have easily stood on its own, and probably should have. There was something satisfying about the story ending where it did.  While the sequels were good in their own ways, I personally feel that the books should have ended with the first and the rest should have been left to the imagination.

It is a problem that I keep seeing this problem show up in numerous other books (and quite frankly, films): everybody is so hell-bent on making the next Harry Potter, that nobody feels content to let a story stands on its own. There is [a film adaptation coming](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/universal-adapt-neal-shusterman-ya-891595), and I'm worried that the film will ignore the story and attempt too hard to set up a franchise.",7,1583183232,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fcj07t/the_arc_of_a_scythe_series_or_why_some_books/,books,1

fciqiv,DJse7entyse7en,I know it's been posted numerous times but here is my take on Blood Meridian's ending.,"&gt;!  I've just finished BM and looked to the internet to see what the general consensus was to the ambiguous ending. With the overwhelming majority saying the Judge kills and/or rapes the Kid/Man.  I don't see it that way and here is why.

It seems they are both in Griffin for this final showdown. The Judge wanting it so much he talks the ""men"" into shooting the bear as a distraction. (""When he turned the judge had risen and was speaking with other men.""  ,  ""...the judge was not there. The showman seemed to be at altercation with the men standing at the table.""  ,  ""One of the men had drawn a longbarreled cavalry pistol..."") Then he is at the bar talking with the kid. The barman apparently gone as he is interested in the dead bear, (""Shot the goddamned bear, said the barman"") the Judge reaches over and steals a bottle from the bar. Drinking some himself but repeatedly filling the Kids tumbler, eventually making it so the Kid needs to pee. The Kid makes his way to the jakes for a wizz and steps into the building only to find the Judge already waiting for him. 

So now let's go back to the bar and the long speech by the Judge as to how they are there to dance. I believe this to be a reference to the afterlife. As the Judge is waiting for this final showdown and knows there will finally be one victor left out of the Gang. (""The last of the true. I'd say they're all gone under now saving me and thee""  ,  ""And there will be one there always who is a true dancer...""  ,  ""There is room on this stage for one beast and one alone."") 

I believe the Kid/Man kills the Judge in the jakes. Then still having to pee steps back out and just pees in the mud, being the third man that tells the other two to not go into the outhouse. Then the Judge also meets his fate and gets to enter the dance/afterlife, knowing now he can never sleep/never die. 

His fate talked about to the Kid, he wants to make it to this dance but sees that the times are changing and he will have no place in this new world of order and law. His way to the dance is almost Viking-esqe. Wanting to die in battle to make it to Valhalla (the dance). (""I tell you this. As war becomes dishonored and it's nobility called into question those honorable men who recognize the sanctity of blood will become excluded from the dance, which is the warriors right, and thereby will the dance become a false dance and the dancers false dancers. And yet there will be one there always who is a true dancer and can you guess who that might be?""  ,  ""Only that man who has offered up himself entire to the blood of war, who has been to the floor of the pit and seen the horror in the round and learned at last that it speaks to his inmost heart, only that man can dance."") He sees this as his one last chance to still make it to the dance, and he sees the Kid as the one worthy to deliver him. Eventually welcoming it with open arms. (""...he rose up smiling and gathered him in his arms against his immense and terrible flesh..."")  

And then in the final paragraphs we see him at his dance. He is happy and nimble and dancing and repeating over and over how he will never sleep and never die. !&lt;",2,1583182243,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/fciqiv/i_know_its_been_posted_numerous_times_but_here_is/,books,1

fcgyiv,Rasselegenden,Buying a Kindle?,"Hello folks. I am thinking of buying a kindle paperwhite 2018. Right now its on sale and I really don't want to miss out on it. So I only have 4 hours to decide. 

The thing is, I'm only 17. I have 11 WoT books, some random fantasy books, Mistborn 1, Dune and Ender's Game. I still want to expand my collection, but if I buy a kindle, it might seem unnecessary to buy any physical copies of books. If I get a kindle, cost of books won't be a problem for me.
