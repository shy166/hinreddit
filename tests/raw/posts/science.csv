Science journalists are working overtime to provide the answers, and in this AMA they will answer your questions: Where we get our information, and how to evaluate the real-time science flooding the internet.



I am Laura Helmuth ([@laurahelmuth](https://twitter.com/laurahelmuth)). I’m the health and science editor for the Washington Post for a few more days, and soon to be the editor-in-chief of Scientific American. I’ve also been an editor for National Geographic, Slate, Smithsonian, and Science magazines, and I’m the immediate past president of the National Association of Science Writers. 

 

I am Helen Branswell ([@HelenBranswell](https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell)). I’m a senior writer at STAT, an online news publication focused on health, where I cover infectious diseases and global health. I am a veteran of a number of major disease outbreaks, including the 2003 SARS outbreak, the Zika outbreak of 2015 and numerous Ebola outbreaks. I was a 2011 Nieman Global Health Fellow at Harvard and a 2004 CDC Knight Fellow.
