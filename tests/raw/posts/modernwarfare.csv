You can go into a practice game right now and try it out for yourself, see the difference between how much the gun bounces into your face with the Muzzle Brake vs the Compensator.

fsnm6s,69throwawayslater,"Blueprints are broken, and in need of a simple fix","This has been a small but disappointing thing so far with gunsmith. I believe it would be an easy fix that would add much more customization into the game. I bought a Kar blueprint because I thought it was bad ass and I was going for platinum at the time. Upon unlocking platinum I discovered the blueprint didn't lay on top of the camo like the other ones did.

Link with further descriptions on what I am talking about: [https://imgur.com/a/Pk1Q1Vn](https://imgur.com/a/Pk1Q1Vn)

The Kar is just one example of blueprints not laying on top of the mastery camos like the normal camos do. Every weapon has this issue. I wish this would get a fix because it would allow for much more customization and improve the overall look of guns in this game.

Personally, I know I would be more tempted to buy battle passes and packs in the store if mastery camos went under the blueprint like every other camo did.",6,1585696199,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsnm6s/blueprints_are_broken_and_in_need_of_a_simple_fix/,modernwarfare,4

fsne2t,ODSTCombo,"Has anyone noticed that ""ZLR Special"" is on a lot of weapons?","So I'm sure everyone has noticed those all-white weapons, including the corrupter from season 1 battle pass, that have a ZLR label in red, yeah? But I've noticed that there's a good amount of weapons that say ""ZLR Special"" on them. I'll list the ones I've noticed (which I bought because they're clean imo):

* ""ZLR Special"" EBR-14 from ""ZLR Special"" pack (obviously)
* ""Grand Marshal"" Kilo 141 from ""ZLR Special 2"" pack (also kinda obvious, the knife in that pack also matches the rose-gold and black theme as well)
* ""Volatile"" .357 from ""Mad Chemist"" pack (not too obvious)
* ""Quick Hit"" X16 from ""Gun Nut"" pack, which is a very nice pack (barely obvious, small hint of rose-gold and tiny little ZLR Special trademark at bottom of the grip)

If anyone finds any weapons that fit this ongoing theme (rose-gold and black, not the white ones) please comment them here so I can buy them; I want to collect them all! I love to pair blueprints that have that same theme/skin on them, even though they're from different packs (e.g. all the ones listed, oscar mike and heat cycle \[green+gray, Gun Nut, Run N' Gun mission\], code breaker and eradication \[black+sliver &amp; ammunition engraved on the side of both weapons, Level 155 Season 2, Gun Nut\]).",5,1585695413,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsne2t/has_anyone_noticed_that_zlr_special_is_on_a_lot/,modernwarfare,1

fsn6pa,sccjono,Things I've noticed...,"Just for fun, feel free to add more.

If you hear the words ""I've got your six"", watch your six cause that guy is out of here. See also ""I'm with you"" etc.

Anyone on your team with a riot shield, will often use it to get in your way. Doubly so if you just need one more mounted kill.

Some people don't care what the purpose of the game is, they're just happy to be there.

Some people can't even point blank you without aiming. They deserve to get stuck behind the guy who always blocks the window you need.

On every map there is always that one guy stuck trying to climb up on something and feels he's won the game when he manges it. Sometimes that guy is me.

On rust there will be a guy in the end of the pipe. He doesn't care if all the action is elsewhere. He knows eventually that you'll have to run past. He will miss you when you do. 

There is always one person that jumps everywhere and although he thinks he's cool, he looks like a rabid kangaroo on amphetamine.

There is always one guy that has to slide everytime they are shot at. They think it makes them harder to hit. It doesn't, it just means they have less far to fall.

I finished skulls for the knife in only 5 games of shipment. It's been 3 hours and I only have 2 done with the riot sheild. I don't like to complaine about little things but this is ridiculous. I hate using the riot sheild and I feel bad for the other people in the lobby when I do. I wish they would change it but I know they won't.

It‚Äôs supposed to improve ADS speed but it actually does the opposite. It also has decreases bullet velocity so it‚Äôs a waste of an attachment if it‚Äôs still bugged. 

This is concerning because the new MW2 M4A1 (Task Force Blueprint) uses this barrel, and apparently swapping out the barrel changes the iron sights. 

Here‚Äôs a link to Ace‚Äôs guide. He mentions the barrel at the 5:22 mark. Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

fslg81,Frank-Planka,(Soccer) Cutscene Glitch,"So I was playing through the MW campaign and I was streaming it to a friend. We came across a few broken cutscenes. (The cutscene would repeat right after completing however the player was now in the game). The cutscene before \~The Wolfs Den\~ right before I was to take the guard tower, was broken and looped twice, and after the cutscene looped twice, I skipped it. This loaded me into the game, however, another cutscene started playing. It was an odd square window with a grainy CCTV filter over it playing what appeared to almost be a FIFA ad but from the 90s. It continued to play for around 50 seconds and then looped endless times. I wasn't able to get a photo because I had no idea what was happening.

fsl43r,Lord_Failure,"XP not tracking properly and horrible lag and latency, among other issues...","XP not tracking is an issue that continues to exist even with a supposed fix implemented by IW, and over the past several days there are STILL posts on this issue with a lot of half-solutions that either don‚Äôt work or only work temporarily.

This is amplified even more when there is such garbage latency and lag issues going on. In my personal experience over the past dozen or so matches I‚Äôve played my ping would spike through the roof maybe 2 minutes into the match. Most times it‚Äôs anywhere from 200 to 399 ping, with the worst being consistent 999 ping for the entire match. And once it spikes it never goes down despite every other person in the server never breaking 99 ping. I understand the current epidemic going on has servers under stress but how can this game shove me (USA) into matches with people apparently gaming in Tasmania or the backwoods of Siberia on such a consistent basis?

These issues do not make the game fun at all to play and those are just the main gripes. Huge unoptimized patches, challenges not tracking, blatant cheaters and aimbots, all these just bundle together to make me lose faith in IW, and I don‚Äôt want to lose faith because I love this game and what the devs have done with it. These issues are just extremely frustrating and it‚Äôs almost unbearable to have to play this otherwise awesome game.

Don't get me wrong. The one we have looks nice I just don't really understand why we got a M4A1 perfectly replicated to be the MW2 one (which looks damn good btw), but the 1911 doesn't resemble MW2's in either the one you can use or captain Prices' while the name of the variant being a reference to the game and it being sold with the game. I feel this was a real missed opportunity. 

Here's what it actually looks like for those wondering:

fska7p,oscar230,PC crash to desktop fix. A solution that works for me with a 100% success rate.,"**TLDR**: login as administrator user. Tutorial below.

After problems with the client crashing to desktop without a visible error code, more than QA logs in Documents folder I had enough. Tried a bunch of possible fixes. Although after switching to the administrator user of my windows machine i can now run the client for however long i want with a 100% success rate. Note that this is not the same as just *running as administrator* in fact this user is disabled by default. This crash to desktop issue is a problem for a lot of PC users at the moment I'm therefore creating this post.

Please fill out the poll at the bottom of this post.

**Tutorial**:

* Open either CMD or PowerShell **as administrator** by searching for one of them in the start menu. I prefer PowerShell for it simplicity.
* Enter the command ""*net user administrator /active:yes*"" into the terminal window and press enter. You can deactivate this by switching *yes* to *no*.
* Switch user by pressing windows key + L and press the button at the bottom or open start menu, press your own login name and then select ""Administrator"" right below the logout option.
* When launching the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client it will ask you to login, do this.
* You will then be prompted to install call of duty modern warfare, **do not do this** the game is already installed, instead scan you system for the game or locate it directly from its installation path.

[More methods and the source](https://www.technipages.com/windows-administrator-account-login-screen) to enable the administrator user if you cant use the terminal for some reason.

**For the novice:** Please note that you are now running windows from another users perspective, it may look like you system is reinstalled but in fact it is not. All of your files and settings are intact at your other users account. Simply switch user to access that data. If you need to chat with your friend over discord you may or may not have to install that client again. Then login again. This may be a bit of a headache to have to reset you old changes but that's life right now. :D

[This other fix](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/flbb47/pc_crash_warzone_fix_its_finally_gone/) worked for me once, but is in my regard not reliable. Although some claim to be so ill leave it here just in case.

Help each other out in the comment section, i will try to be active there as well.

fsk2ck,JustBk0z,Ironsights should be able to changed like reticles for optics,"One of the frustrating aspects of modern warfare to me is having so many attachments to choose from, and being forced to waste an attachment slot on a barrel or optic in order to avoid frustrating ironsights

This post was inspired by the fact that I was trying to use the M4 with SOCOM rounds and the predator barrel was perfect for me. I thought that SOCOM rounds were the perfect way to get around the downsides of the predator barrel, but the ironsights are very different from almost every other barrel and were personally almost impossible for me to track my targets with (even without recoil). 

I don‚Äôt think in a game that emphasizes customization and being able to change your guns tangible stats, you could have to use a precious attachment slot to change something subjective about the gun. 

My solution would be to let players change the foresight of their gun to any of the other foresights of the other barrels/variants of that gun. For example, for the M4, if you used the ‚ÄúPurist‚Äù variant, the change from the circular housing of to the boxier housing of the sight would remain the same, but you would be able to use the shorter 3-pronged grenadier barrel ironsights on the predator barrel instead of the longer 3-prongs. Or you could use the base Grau ironsights on the nexus barrel. 

Note: ironsights would become available when you unlocked that specific barrel/variant",48,1585684831,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsk2ck/ironsights_should_be_able_to_changed_like/,modernwarfare,20

I tried nearly anything there is to try:

\- Change IP address

\- Change router model

\- Lan cable using (nope doesn't work either!)

\- Port forwarding

\- Resetting router

\- reset both the PC &amp; PS4 consoles ( doesn't  work!) 

\- Contacted internet provider (Problem is Activision they say) 

\- Changed settings in DHCP

\*No, we don't use the same account

\*One version is downloaded, other is on disc

\*Problem only occurred in this game! 

\*Contacted Activision with no fix

‚óèCustom lobbies being an integral part of the game

‚óèRemoval of game modes that were successful amongst the community converted into playlist

What are some things you think MP should've kept/done?",8,1585684106,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsjucf/two_things_mp_should_have_kept_imo/,modernwarfare,7

fsjrxo,Lil_Fishieeee,Questions about the story,"(Spoilers for campaign)

So at the end of the campaign there's a cutscene that shows Al Asad. It says ""Story continued in spec ops"" or something like that. But spec ops didn't really do that. All it really did was confirm Al Asad exists in this universe, but the campaign cutscene already did that so technically spec ops didn't even do that. Am I just missing something? What else does spec ops contribute to the story? Sure there's the whole thing about the plutonium and the nuclear war heads. maybe they'll do something with that, I don't know. Is there something I missed or is that all that has to do with the story?

In the opening cinematic for Season 2, Ghost says something along the lines of ""There's something wrong in Verdansk. They're killing their own."" And then it shows they're in battle royale. So does that mean that battle royale is part of the story? Battle royal is in Verdansk and so is spec ops.

In Season 3 there's supposed to be an Operator named 'Alex'. Could this be the same Alex from campaign? If so, then how is he alive?

Personally I don't like how they're making the story intertwined with with the other game modes. If they confirm Alex survived the explosion in multiplayer I'm gonna be a little upset. I feel like something that big should be in the campaign for the the sequel",5,1585683891,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsjrxo/questions_about_the_story/,modernwarfare,3

fsjr97,BXtony76911,The spec ops need some sort of fix.,"I tried operation pladdin today for the operator but failed 5 times because of the enemy just spawning and shooting from all directions in large groups. I was playing with 2 randoms and a friend,  the randoms were coordinating with us and we had mikes so we were a fine squad, i had a pkm with 200 rounds and fmj and a shotgun while my friend had a riot sheild and an lmg.we had one medic , one armour guy and two people with stopping powers.
 We failed twise as soon after activating the first crate because 100s of boys just kept on coming and shooting from all directions , the cover was of hardly any use as they just kept shooting us from unknown direction and hardly visible cracks. I managed to get the randoms up for retries and we finally managed to clear the first crate up. Well the second crate was even more awful , it was inside atlas superstore and even though i had cover i just died to the swarm of enemies. We pressed retry and then we failed again at the first checkpoint as this time the care package did not give us the juggernaut.
The spec ops need to be fixed its been so long since the release and still so broken , the system sends a whole country to tske out 4 guys.",3,1585683834,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsjr97/the_spec_ops_need_some_sort_of_fix/,modernwarfare,10

I'm at tier 90 and have been grinding these last couple weeks but don't know if the fix will be applied before the season ends. I was wondering if there was a way to just purchase the last 10 tiers through the app or website or somewhere that isn't the game (because I can't launch it at all) so that I can finish the pass.

fsj0h7,PGCchannel,Does the WiFi affect the performance?,"I was playing Warzone with a good WiFi and then my WiFi had a problem, and sympathetically, all the online games I owned lagged a lot. This is supposed to be normal, but even though I had the old wifi, I also had performance issues like frame drops (On both Fortnite and Warzone, I got the same 20 FPS) while before I was getting 80FPS on a laptop. I thought my laptop had a problem, and since we are in quarantine I tried every possible home solution. Then, I ran Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and I got the usual 180FPS on the campaign (I just want 60, but there is no frame limit) with like 0,05FDPM (1 frame drop per 20 minutes average). Now, I want to ask, since, before the Wifi error, I got 80FPS on medium to high settings in Warzone, in MW2 Remastered, will I get 60FPS too because it is an offline game? Or because Warzone had graphic glitches and frame drops, and not just ping, Modern Warfare 2 won't run either? 

My PC specs are:

* GTX1050ti (Laptop)
* 8GB RAM DDR4
* Intel Core i7
* 1TB HDD + 128GB SSD

fsik3g,FRISKYxFERRET69,Aim response curve,I‚Äôve done some research on it and understand (kinda) what the difference is. I‚Äôve always been standard but just today switched to dynamic and gave it a whirl. My issue overall is I tend to over correct my aim. So if I‚Äôm missing to the right I fling my stick left and it‚Äôs too drastic of a movement then I‚Äôm missing left and I‚Äôm dead. So I see dynamic kind of makes it so once you aim it‚Äôs almost impossible to adjust aim. I‚Äôm not the most accurate but I also am not terrible either. I do enjoy playing fast and the dynamic seemed snappy and I like that. But there were a couple gunfights I just missed aim and couldn‚Äôt get my aim on the guy. So I‚Äôm conflicted. Anyone have opinions on which I should go with? I play on 6/6 .75ADS. I put it on 7/7 .9 ADS a couple games into dynamic to try and help me a bit.,11,1585680116,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsik3g/aim_response_curve/,modernwarfare,4
fsik1j,Weetzlo,I honestly consider a lot of the choices made by this game to be anti-casual.,"Honestly, I like the game. I'm probably going to continue to play it for quite some time despite the bitching, let me get that out of the way here and now. However, as someone who's just average at the game and who only puts in like 10-12 hours a week of playtime I feel I would enjoy it more if not for some weird choices.

First, SBMM. People have been mad about it since 2014 with AW so I don't need to say anything. I still will though. As someone who's not good, you know what's worse than being defeated? Being cheated. Win, lose, or draw it should be in me and not on the fact that someone's on WiFi across the house from their outdated router. Bare minimum it should be an option like in fighting games. You can even be picky and set it to only find players of similar skill with excellent connections and just deal with longer matchmaking times. 

The mission system honestly drives me crazy. Do you know just how many missions I've done but not accomplished because I didn't have them equiped or wasn't at the right part of the mission? I'm not the ""best of the best"" and I know it, so I don't equip that mission. Once though, I went on a 25 gunstreak. This other time I somehow got an 8x multikill. I don't get a cool calling card or anything though because I was working on Perks of the Job. 

Pointman should absolutely not be a perk, it's should just be the default way the game works. As it is now, in order to be rewarded for playing the objective, I have to give up a perk like restock that would help me play the objective. Garbage. The perk should be to make it killstreaks. Even without adjusting anything else it would just become a better version of Hardline for kill based players. In a mode where kills are worth 100 score juggernaut is a 19 kill streak, but as a true kill streak it's only 15. That's worth a perk I think. 

The attachment grind for is way way more of a chore than it needs to be. I love that there's more gunsmith options. That's awesome. Gating something I want like extended mags behind my 11th reflex sight is not awesome. It should be that you unlock reflex sight and it just gives you the option of Operator or GI or whichever. If they really can't do that then make them unlockable like reticles. 25 kills with the Aim-Op gets you the Cronen.

Still fun enough though, I'm actually going to go play it now.",8,1585680112,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsik1j/i_honestly_consider_a_lot_of_the_choices_made_by/,modernwarfare,3

fsihd2,Kurkpitten,Overused Weapons : a matter of community perception,"Having been on the game since the last double xp/shoot the ship event, but on the sub way before that, I am familiar with some of the issues this game has known.

One that has not been adressed yet seems to be more on annoyance than an actual complaint is some weapon being overused, namely the M4 and the MP5.

This is still being brought up by players here, more as a meme it seems, since those guns are not that OP. They do not impede the enjoyment of the game, and one can still enjoy other weapon classes. To me, since I have not known the 725 spam days, this feels like a balanced and varied COD experience.

So here is my ( pretty subjective ) take on what is actually causing an issue to players : 

These guns, and those who use them, are making some players perceive the community in a warped way. 

Seeing people running around with a [COVID] clan tag, Ghost skin, using the aformentioned weapons, is a common sight. Add to that the squeaky mics, and what we are used to in COD communities, and this might be, to some players, reminiscent of the days where other installments of the franchise started dying or becoming unbearably boring.

When MW2, the one people are so nostalgic about, was a thermal/akimbo 1887 fest. MW3 and BO2 where maybe 3 or 4 guns were all that was used, with SMGs everywhere, all the time. I am not talking about Hardcore, which makes the game way more varied. But your average player, me for example, can get some bad impression from things that do not affect the experience directly.

These guns do not prevent varied play and can be countered, yet their ease of use makes them a go to for certain '' types '' of players.

I say '''' types '''' because we have all used them, yet they give us an impression of playing against the oh so easily despicable average mountain dew drinking 14 year old

They do not ruin the game, nor the balance, but they make it kind of boring to look at.

Skins added another layer of conformity, since it's Ghost vs Krueger and Grinch most games.

So what do you all think ? Do any of you share similar perceptions ? Do any of you feel like the way we perceive our community can be warped by our expectations of what a COD game can turn into, from previous experiences that had similar outcomes ?",34,1585679875,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsihd2/overused_weapons_a_matter_of_community_perception/,modernwarfare,5

Unfortunately, the moment you apply damascus to some skinned weapons, it just turns it into damascus. For some skins, like the Corrupter for the Ram, it can look gorgeous, but for many others, it just makes a gun look like a stock weapon with Damascus on it. The reason I want a title for damascus, is then we can both show off something nice we got from the store/battle pass AND show that we put in the effort to get Damascus (And went through the pain that is the Riot shield to do so).

Okay so this is actually about the _odern _arfare _wo _ampaign PS exclusivity issue.

This is 100% fucking bullshit.

What is the actual fucking point in this? This is hardly going to make anyone go out of their way to buy a PS4. This is just going to make thousands of fans, including myself, resentful of Sony and Activision as if there wasn't already plenty of reason enough.

I don't feel entitled to anything. Honestly it's amazing that IW or whoever made the campaign took the time to do it and give it out for free. It's a nice surprise! But then to only give it to one third of your fanbase is just fucking baffling.

Like really, what is the logic here? Activision obviously wanted to suck up Sony's money on the table. But what the fuck kind of benefit do PS4 players get out of this? 90% of people dont give a fuck about which console is preferable anymore and actually hate this bullshit.

fsha4e,Number4hater,This cod is the worst cod I've ever played. (besides iw and aw),"It's not the people who camp with mp7s and shotguns. It's the game that encourages it. The spawn system that spawns you infront of 3 russian giants that smash your head in with their boots. The ghost perk making you practically invisible when hiding in a dark corner. I really hope season 3 fixes all of those problems and makes this cod the best cod ever. Please, i want to love this game. But I just can't.

It screws your team completely if you get killed because likely the enemy will get it or I guess if you're lucky a teammate will grab it up (good for him).

Everytime I start the game on PC/Blizzard, I have no sound through the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I always have to go into sound settings and change my output device from my headset (Razer Kraken) to my monitor and then back to my headset so that the sound comes through.

&amp;#x200B;

All normal and I wouldnt mind it just being this if I had to do it everytime but then the other issue is that voice chat never works.

fsgbob,seanronan3,Unpopular opinion : people that cry over shoot the ship just want the easy way out of getting the camos.,"This new cabin fever playlist is perfect, the one gripe I have with this game is that the original maps are way too big. Now IW have added a playlist with the small maps in it and people are still complaining. I understand shipment is a fan favourite but the mastery camo is SUPPOSED TO BE A GRIND. They made it so it will actually take some time to achieve Damascus and people get a couple of gold guns on shipment and think they deserve to have it forever. I agree they should not be rotating playlists and just keep some in but Jesus Christ these people are putting there hard time into making the game we love and with all the stuff going on in the world today and they are STILL working hard to give us what we want and people still complain at them.

fsg62s,TobogganLips,Question on minimum requirements.,"**EDIT:** This specifically pertains to the Warzone game mode of Modern Warfare.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the replies. I know it's a very old processor. I don't really expect it to handle the game, I was just curious if there's a method of bypassing the restriction so we could just give it a go.

‚Äî

Hi there,

One of my older systems has an AMD Phenom II X4 955 ""Black Edition"" processor. It's obviously under the minimum requirements of an AMD FX-6300. It won't even launch the game.

However, I am wondering if there's an .ini file or something that can be edited (or any workaround at all) that would bypass this restriction. I realize that this CPU has much older instruction sets as it's what, 12 years old now? But it runs most other games for my son at an acceptable frame-rate, as it's paired with a decent GPU. He plays Fallout, Apex Legends, GTA V, etc.

If it's a hard no, that's cool. I figured I'd ask before we pull the trigger on a used FX-8350 that's currently in the local classifieds.

Thanks.",5,1585672583,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fsg62s/question_on_minimum_requirements/,modernwarfare,2

fsfxwe,MasterPrestigeBurge,So this is my theory (Cod 2020),"So this is a mixture of what I THINK might happen and what I definitely WANT to happen.

So with this ongoing worldwide Pandemic, the chances of COD 2020 being delayed 12 months is in my eyes a MASSIVE possibility. So here's the thing...

If it was to be delayed I think this is what will happen.

Activision will tell IW to add all the fan favourite maps into MW 2019, I'm talking High Rise, Terminal, Dome. The absolute CLASSICS.
They will also add all the fan favourite classic weaponry from the MW series.

They will rework the current game slightly adding a prestige system of sorts in order to always have something to grind for, and add Dead Silence as a perk for instance. Maybe even reduce SBMM. 

All of this will be to soften the blow and be an apology if you like from Activision that they have had to delay Cod 2020. They will not want to lose the massive amount of money that they would lose were it to be delayed. Hence adding this classic nostalgic stuff into MW 2019 will keep the vast amount of fans happy going into 2020. It would certainly keep me happy we're these things to happen.

These rumours of IW reworking/remastering up to 60 classic maps from the MW series is all the proof I need to think this is going to come true. Especially so if this pandemic lasts long into the summer as predicted.

I have no trouble in any other game I play. No lag at all. Also anywhere I go and bring my Xbox it does the same thing. Good or bad internet. I‚Äôve uninstalled, reset my Xbox, checked all of my network setting in the console and to no success it continues to happen.

fsf7yv,FidoErEnHund,How best to reduce recoil?,"I'm not on top of my game. After a long COD hiatus my aim is off. Not a lot, but just enough that I'm losing face-up confrontations, I would've won in Ghosts, BO2, and MW2.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
The remedy (for me) is to reduce recoil as much as possible. The question is how?  
Which attachemnts will ""convert"" my assault rifle into a laser?  
It doesn't matter if firerate goes down, sprint out speed is increased, ADS time is increased, damage output is lowered, or any other stat goes negative. If I'm only looking to make my ARs as stable, or recoil-less, as possible, which attachments should I be looking at?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Which assault rifle has the least recoil?  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
And finally, I see people praise the Kilo 141 a lot, but is it just me, or does it have a slower TTK than both the M4A1 and M13? Of which I vastly prefer the latter. M13 is love.  
It's the same with the shotguns. I'll take the R9-0 over the 725 any day of the week, but that's not what this topic should be about.  
  
&amp;nbsp;

fsemtd,brodiebradley51,Surely the devs cannot be satisfied with the balance of this game (Critical Feedback),"The MP completely rewards players using fast firing weapons, with all the advantages they have. 

Slow firing weapons have slow ADS and sprint out times, often more recoil, slower RoF obviously, and get punished by the attachment system even more. 

Fast firing weapons have better ads and sprint out usually, better handling, faster RoF, lower recoil and are less punished by attachments. 

There is very little application and use for slower firing subs and AR‚Äôs and this translates in game with constant full lobbies of M4s, MP5, MP7, M13, kilo users etc. 

Now only LMG‚Äôs. They are so underused it‚Äôs unreal. As this game has piss poor ADS and sprint out for almost all weapons, guns like these are never going to be viable. 

Some have higher recoil, and recoil reduction attachments worsens your already terrible ADS times. This needs to be sorted. Also applies to more specialised weapons like the Marksman Rifles. 

The reluctancy to nerf or standardise elements of the gunplay is hurting the game big time. It rewards camping more, as if you can already be aimed in, as the handling is so bad, you are basically guaranteed the kill. 

Surely they cannot sit there and think ‚Äòwow, what a diverse range of used weapons we see in game. Good job guys‚Äô. This is a disgrace. I‚Äôm sorry but it really is. 

I know you‚Äôll get people on here who go ‚ÄòI slay every game with the SA87 LMG, so your wrong!‚Äô but reflect on your in game experience. 

How often do you actually die to an Uzi, or a Bizon, or an Oden, or a Scar. Probably once every few games over dying to an M4 or MP5 over 10 times per game. 

The solution is to standardise ADS times and sprint out, with only subtle differences if they want it. Also have these base-lines lower so across the board, ADS times and sprint out times are just better overall. 

Also, give more recoil, slightly less range and lower the headshot multiplier on the fast firing weapons to help make the slower firing more desirable and more on par with the rest.

It would be nice to see some actual variety and not getting insta-melted by an M4 or an MP5 every game.

Another way to achieve this partially, would be to have a separate mosh pit playlist where HP is increased to 130. This way, players who like a slower TTK can be more willing to play but also that the guns will balance themselves out better so this would also be nice.

So, I've been playing COD since it's launch back in October and haven't experienced any problemas whatsoever.  
However, after the latest update, it turned my GPU (PC specs below) crazy.   
After 30 minutes playing, my game closed automatically claiming Paging File Error. To my surprise, after three times trying to open the game up, it closed with the same error after a minute or so.

When I rebooted my PC, it would crash almost instantly after entering Windows.   
The ""fix"" I found was restarting my PC on security mode, running DDU and reinstalling the AMD Drivers.

After playing 2 hours of Overwatch without any crashes, the minute I opened COD, it crashed with ""dev error 6068"". To fix that, I managed to mess with some of the graphic options and went fine.

Today, when I booted my PC, the same problem happened: It crashed almost instantly after loading Windows.

The fix? The same above. Rebooting into safe mode, running DDU and reinstalling the latest drivers.

Any ideas? Is the game really bugged out that way? Any possible fixes for the Windows crash?

fsay7g,LostMyPantsGuy,What is the point of the underbarrel shotgun?,"The damage is abysmal, you have to literally be on top of the person to get all the pellets to hit and get a one shot kill. The swap speed between the shotty and whatever weapon it is on feels sluggish as all hell. It feels faster if I'm running amped and an overkill shotgun than a shotgun that is technically already in your hand! 

To make the shotty more viable, I feel like increasing the accuracy a little bit more and speed up the swap speed between the gun and shotty should in theory put it at a decent level so you have the choice between overkill amped shotty or the underbarrel.

So, there's this YouTuber named TheGamingRevolution that has apparently built a reputation for being mostly right on Call of Duty leaks and he dropped a tweet where he lists a bunch of upcoming Activision projects including Modern Warfare 2 Remastered.

[https://twitter.com/TheGamingRevo2/status/1238173268126904324?ref\_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/TheGamingRevo2/status/1238173268126904324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) 

Now, we know that Modern Warfare 2 Remastered is real and it just got a surprise release today but I don't think I should rely on that one prediction turning true to justify his legitimacy.

We have had 11 years to replay the MW2 campaign for nostalgic reasons, and IW is asking us to do the same thing for 25$ with slightly better graphics. And what are we supposed to do after we play the campaign , it takes roughly 3-4 hours to beat. Spend your money how you want, but im not paying 25$ to only kill bots, bots that i killed 11 years ago.

I'm constantly going back and forth with either not being able to hear anything in the game or hearing explosions and shooting super loudly. 

Is it so hard to have more options to change the audio? 

The sound that plays every time you turn on the game is super loud and in my opinion pointless. Every time I'm starting the game I have to take off my headphones for 10 seconds because it's so loud, the same thing happens with the audio when you are sent to the Gulag, why are those sounds so loud and can't be turned down a bit??

The other problem is while playing warzone I have to choose between not hearing anything (huge disadvantage not being able to hear footsteps and other sounds around you) or hearing my own footsteps super loudly, gunshots and explosions also deafeningly loud. 

Why is this so hard to figure out? It's not like this is the first ever Cod or battle royal game.

I love the game but it's super frustrating having to play either deaf or waiting to literally become deaf from all the super loud unnecessary sounds.

fs9m9c,TrumpedWildcard,2 Hours Playing Cabin Fever - Results,"I saw the posts of people complaining that the **Cabin Fever** playlist was returning ***no*** Shipment, Rust or even Shoot House games, and also the Infinity Ward Twitter post that they had made a change so that more games on these maps would come up. I decided to jump in the playlist last night to check for myself (I've been playing mostly Warzone or Hideout 24/7), from a 2 hour sample of games and see if Infinity Ward had actually made changes.

&amp;#x200B;

* I tracked the games as I went along and got the times from the 'Call of Duty Companion App' this morning.
* I decided to also track the result of each match to see if it ended from *Score Limit* being reached, or if it was due to the *Time Limit*.
* I never backed out and searched again for other games.

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see from the image, it doesn't look like any changes were made by Infinity Ward like they said. I only got Gun Runner and Hackney Yard games, but mostly Gun Runner with 8 out 10 games being on it. I actually stopped after 2 hours because I got 4 games of Gun Runner in a row and was so bored by it (I hate Team Deathmatch and I'm not overly fond of Kill Confirmed).

&amp;#x200B;

It's also pretty damning that 7 out of 10 games all ended because of Time Limit. Gun Runner should never be in this playlist; it doesn't play like a small map and the fact it ends so frequently due to Time Limit shows it doesn't play well to 6v6 either.

fs9j09,fliper5067,Constant Crashing / Closing - PC,"Just got the game the other day, and i have been faced with constant crashing with no error messages. Sometimes they happen mid game, sometimes they happen at the menu. Ive tried:

* Updating My Drivers
* Updating Windows
* Lowering All My settings 
* Changing the priority of the program in task manager
* Reinstalling Shaders
* Checking the Program for errors via blizzard launcher
* And a bunch of other things that I cant remember right now

My Pc meets minimum requirements, However i only have 8gb of ram (the minimum) could this be the issue?  The game runs smoothly other than the crashes, and i never get an error message.

1. Flag/Bomb Site Transparency - Is there a way to turn down the transparency or make it completely disappear if aiming? It's nearly impossible to see enemies if you're aiming at a peak spot and the bomb site is right there. It only becomes invisible if aimed exactly on the letter.
2. Kill/Death Ratio Watch - This is generally a non-issue as it's always visible on my Striker, however, I straight up don't see it at all when I use an AR, and not fully visible on other SMGs. It is possible that my red suited Yegor has his hands further holding some attachment, but aside from that, I can't see the watch at all.
3. Friends not showing as online - They see me. Sometimes I see them. Sometimes I don't. Last few days, they don't show as online. I'm on PC and they're on PS4. It's as if the game decides which friend they want to show online.
4. The fucking plane - Is it possible to outright mute the god damn plane? I know it's probably not possible, but what can I do to minimize this horrendous sound?

fs8nrh,Eazer27,IW you marketed this game with NVG modes please bring back a perminant realism playlist,"It was such a nice refreshing addition to the gameplay of call of duty. It felt like it had more campaign moments out of any other mode. It made me feel so badass donning the NVGs and breaching a door with a shotgun, or stalking the outer edges in the dark with an SMG. Turning the lights on inside a building with campers, flash bang and then rushing in while they scramble to disable their goggles. It was nice seeing how even diffrent streaks were slightly changed, the wheeldon had fog lights, the chopper gunner had to use thermal to make it easier to see, ect. The BEST part was the 1 shot headshots, making the game seem ACTUALLY more tactical and  well, realistic.

I know some people here have already mentioned that they want it back, and I know right now we have the Infected mode with the limited NGVs but I think having a dedicated tab in quick play, like HC or CDL,  or a permanent NVG moshpit playlist would bring a lot of joy to players again. Maaaaaybe add some more maps to it? I know a night time shoothouse or rust would be *NICE*! I know theres a lot going on probably, especially with the impact from Covid 19 and other things already planned for the game.but its sucks to see a cool mode removed from the game and I hope it comes back",128,1585640186,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs8nrh/iw_you_marketed_this_game_with_nvg_modes_please/,modernwarfare,1

fs771r,somelib,"Suggestion: Battle Royale is fun, and Plunder is really fun, but something is missing?"," I  was thinking what a fun game mode Plunder was, but after playing it  more it kind of feels like it's missing something, in my opinion.  I  think it's missing was that sense of anxiety about combat that you get  in a other battle royale games.  But at the same time I also don't like  how frustrating those games can be, and very much like the ability to  jump back into the fight in Plunder, but again, the risks in plunder are  not high enough to make dying hurt the same way.

**With that in mind, what about a new game mode with:**

* Same basic rules as plunder, first to million starts a clock, most money wins
* All  players start with a basic pistol and maybe a double-barrel or  something.  Weapons can be found in loot boxes, but they are relatively  rare.  Most boxes would have no weapons
* Double  the buy zones across the map, add a bit more cash,  and have a custom  loadouts option, listing each of your custom loadouts.....
* Here's  the tricky part:  Assign a dollar value on custom loadouts based on the  weapons and attachments used in it.  Pistols cost 5,000 - 50,000,  Assault rifles cost 25,000 - 100,000, SMG's and Shotguns go between  15,000 and 50,000, or whatever, and so on for all items/attachments .   Have it be scaled in such a way that the default loadouts would range  from 35k-125k and the most decked out one possible would be like  300,000.
* When  you die, your weapons only drop for your teammates, yourself, and maybe  the team that kills you.  Dropped weapons disappear after a few  minutes, or when you buy a new loadout, whichever comes first (dying  needs to hurt just a little and knowing free weapons are scarce is good  incentive)
* Boost kill rewards to be 30% higher than what a player drops, to incentivize combat and help offset expenses

This  kind of mode would force people to balance out spending on defense or  offense with actually collecting enough money to win, and adds more  teamwork elements in trying to recover or protect guns. It makes combat  more profitable to give incentive to spend money getting better weapons  and fighting, but also makes losing those weapons just that much more  painful so the fights need to be more tactical/coordinated

Oh also make vehicles consume money as if it were gas with rates proportionate to the vehicle

fs63e0,RogueSexToy,Search and Destroy or Cyber Attack?,"Which is the better mode for everyone? On the one hand Search and Destroy is more hardcore. There‚Äôs no revives so people have to be more cautious and tactical in their approach. At the same time this means that a single player whose of a high enough skill can very easily clutch a round. This feeling of clutching and no respawns adds to the tension IMO. Not to mention because of the two bomb, attacker v defender set up, a lot more rounds will have the bomb planted compared to Cyber Attack which is mainly about killing the enemy. Hell, sometimes the emp is planted to distract enemies while you go for revives.

Cyber Attack though, requires more team work. Because you can revive, it means a pre-made team with constant communication can easily overwhelm a better fragging team simply through a constant wave of revives. This in turns means that its the optimal team based game mode compared to SnD which while is still team based, can more easily devolve into a one man carry. Not to mention due to the set up both sides will always have to rush at the start of the first round which means usually, a much more aggressive and faster pace. However here‚Äôs a few balancing issues. If you kill someone, it incentivises that you camp their body for more kills. Though this also in turn nullifies long range camper kills as people can be revived out of harm‚Äôs way. There‚Äôs also the problem of spawn camping, letting the enemy rush you, get somewhat overwhelmed, and then pushing when they are on the backfoot. Also, if you win the first round, you can take the bomb and hide every other round until you win. These are some issues which have hurt the game mode in minor ways IMO. 

Personally, I prefer Search and Destroy when solo queueing and Cyber Attack when in a party. I like both almost equally, Cyber IMO I like more mainly because of the revive system and how team based it gets.

fs4kpj,brodiebradley51,MW Playlist Changes (Feedback),"**--6v6 Regular MP--**

*This is the mode thats getting a lot of new, impressive content so i am happier with how to map pool is developing however i do feel some maps are still severely unliked the way they are, but changes can be made to improve them into better 6v6 maps without having to completely redevelop the map overall.*

*For example, all the 10v10 maps can and should be turned into 6v6 maps, with the play-space shrunk and paths blocked off. With this simple change, you can gain about 5 more 6v6 maps that are relatively small in size and can work really well.*

*Add a new playlist called 'Endurance' whereby it is HP set at 130 instead of 100, making the TTK a little longer which helps appeal to more players who maybe dont like the TTK very much in this game. This would be a singular moshpit playlist which plays TDM, Domination and Hardpoint on all 6v6 maps.* 

*Add another mode called Attrition. Attrition is a new mode, which is faster paced and enjoyable --&gt;*

* *Domination-esque with 5 different capture zones, which can be taken within only 1.5s of being on the flag, before the tables turn and you have the flags.* 
* *This mode would also allow kills to account for +1 score for your team, with no penalty for death to reward kill hungry players over more passive players.*
* *The score limit for this mode is 200 like normal but this can change depending on how it plays out overall, again with zone score, and kills adding to your teams overall score.*
* *The big benefit is that the mini-map is always sweeping however this sweeps slightly slower than normal. This means players need to get around and move, with their position being compromised every couple of seconds.*
   * *Ghost has NO impact on this mode. In this mode, Ghost gives you the benefit of arrowed indicators for each sweep (like the infamous Blackbird or VSAT streaks) instead of static dots, still giving it a benefit, but not ruining the mode overall.* 
* *There is no time limit here just like domination but the games will go quicker with the constant action and mechanics around kills v Captures*

&amp;#x200B;

**--10v10--**

*10v10 is a neat idea with bigger maps and bigger player counts, but it just doesnt materialise into much more than a slow paced camp fest for the majority of the games. And with the maps supporting this being fairly mediocre, it really suffers in my opinion. So here are some changes I'd make --&gt;*

***1. Increase player count from 10v10 to 15v15***

*This change alone allows for more players to fill out the increase in size per map. This means you are getting into action a lot quicker and more frequently which is a good thing for sure. This would make it flow so much better overall which is more fun.*

***2. For Domination, Add 2 new flags on them maps***

*These maps can easily support a new flag location on the flank paths for sure. Currently the maps are so narrow in terms of the play space you wanna play in, and where most people hang that it makes most of the map redundant anyway. This gives more incentive to push out and expand the attack for your team.*

***3. Add more maps for 10v10 (or 15v15)***

*Maps like Azhir Caves, or new remade maps could support 15v15 for more chaotic fun overall. Azhir caves would be a quick paced, more engaging map overall. Piccadilly could be opened up a little to accommodate, and new maps can be expanded upon a little to offer much more chaotic action. Even Aniyah Palace could have its bounds shrunk a little to make a good 15v15 map. Gun Runner could also work i feel.*

*New maps added for 15v15 could also be designed so they can shrink the map size and repurpose a 6v6 map also, giving them freedom to fill a gap in both playlists, which is great. This is a way of giving more content without dropping the quality of either. Plus people cannot then feel upset that a relatively unliked mode is getting content when 6v6 isnt!*

&amp;#x200B;

**--Ground War--**

\- *The first change is to allow players to spawn on, or near a flag that is being taken while still in your control. This allows players to react quicker and for more points to be contested and battled upon. Otherwise you are currently forced to run a long way to get here, ruining any ambush for the point.* 

*- Next would be a tank nerf --&gt;*

* *Give them an ammo resource of 8 rounds before a long reload of 7s, meaning positioning is crucial for your team's Tank.*
* *Once a Tank is destroyed, respawn of a new tank has a 45s delay allowing you some breathing room when capturing some points, and gives a real incentive to take out the tanks by all players.*

*- Block off the hillside access on Karst River Quarry for tanks, so that only infantry can go up there, removing the frustrating element of being sniped by a tank you really cant do anything about on the hillside.*",5,1585621376,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs4kpj/mw_playlist_changes_feedback/,modernwarfare,1

fs4e5u,maymaymikey,Question about the canon of MW's Ending (Spoilers contained),"      Hey everyone! So, quick question about the canon of 2019's ending. I can understand that it's a reboot so some things will be changed but something's been bothering me ever since I saw the Tea Time cutscene at the end of the campaign. *SPOILER FOR 2019, MW2, and MW3* Wasn't Soap originally the Cpt and co-creator of 141? Soap's Journal really throws me off when I think of this because it conflicts with FM:OK in that Soap states that he thought Price was dead after the events of CoD4 and created 141 with Shepherd and Shepherd only and only realized Price was alive in the Gulag where he gave up command. It's also weird that Price end up in the Gulag if he never got captured during FM:OK because it didn't happen at all, according to the journal. I've always been annoyed with that plot point but 2019 brings it all back up again with Price creating 141 and pulling Soap straight into 141 without meeting him prior as his CO in the SAS because the events of CoD4 haven't happened (or haven't happened yet). So all I want to ask is what is canon of the following: Soap created 141 and didn't know Price was alive (Soap's Journal), Soap created 141 and did see Price get taken after the events of CoD4 but just didn't mention it in his journal (FM:OK), or none of that, Price actually created it, not Soap (2019... kinda)?",0,1585620702,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs4e5u/question_about_the_canon_of_mws_ending_spoilers/,modernwarfare,1

fs44ap,ThaBigSean,Constant packet loss despite attempts at fixing,"So like the title states I have constant packet loss across both multiplayer and Warzone. This is on PC. The little 3 boxes appear on the side of the screen pretty much every single game for more than 75% of the entire match. It's definitely noticeable when I am sprinting in a straight line because I sort of jab and stutter my way forward. This happens during gameplay which has resulted in a lot of anger. It's incredibly frustrating and I am not sure how to fix it (if its even something I can fix on my end).

Does anyone have any potential fixes? I've done the basic ""fix-your-internet 101"" stuff like resetting my modem but nothing works. I've cleared my BattleNet cache but that did nothing.

fs41vx,Hurtis_Cellyer,"Servers are not bad, skill based matchmaking is just putting us on further servers to try to find fair opponents.",I have been noticing recently that the game I am loosing and not doing well on the opposition is better but I find my self loosing gunfights after I get first shots. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why until I was playing with my friend on pc. We both noticed in games where we lost more gun fights our pings where much higher. My buddy was telling me some games he has 200 ping and gunfights are a nightmare when the game is like this but when we have lower than 50 ping the gun fights feel much smoother and we both won a lot more of them. I think Activision should consider compromising with us on sbm. They clearly won‚Äôt listen to us and take it out so could they hopefully change it to prioritize games with sbm under 50 ping but if it Cannot find that just put us into the game with the lowest ping. With a player base this large and cross platform opportunities I shouldn‚Äôt have to play a game with high ping.,4,1585619372,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs41vx/servers_are_not_bad_skill_based_matchmaking_is/,modernwarfare,1

fs3f1j,Wxgwan,One of the best revolutionary changes in MW3 was the ability to loop your streaks in the same life. Why take that out in Modern Warfare?,"**I‚Äôm talking about when you got all your streaks in the prior games, you had a chance to get them again in the same life.** 

The majority of the streaks in Modern Warfare are pretty much weak, so this change would be balanced. Heck, MW3 had better streaks than this game and it still had that feature. It made the experience more satisfying and fun. 

I know Ground War is in the game, and it makes sense to not have looping streaks for that particular mode, but why should the traditional 6v6 modes follow suit? 

I know people will say that it‚Äôll be broken combined with Killchain, but I disagree. There will be a great trade off when you run Killchain, and it‚Äôs simple. **You won‚Äôt get your streaks in the same life when you‚Äôre running Killchain.** Therefore, it will be balanced.",29,1585616930,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs3f1j/one_of_the_best_revolutionary_changes_in_mw3_was/,modernwarfare,1

fs38nr,AOD_Lucifer,Fatal Error Menu Crash Potential Fix,"So I've been playing this game since it dropped and there have been ZERO issues or crashes at all.  High praises from me compared to black ops 4 that gave me crashes on the daily.  Then 1 day comes my game crashes at the menu upon starting the game and it crashes with this message

Fatal Error  0x0000000142f4fd30 7505236-0xc0000005  modernwarfare.exe

&amp;#x200B;

Looked up the error everywhere and the only posts I found were people who never found a solution.  If the game was fixed for them it went away and they never knew what caused or fixed it.

The began the troubleshooting... I watched tons of videos, read tons of articles, and had tons of friends try to help me with things like event viewer on windows to see if a crash was reported.  I did so many fixes I can guarantee you that whatever fix you could suggest I had tried.  I reinstalled windows, reinstalled the game multiple times, deleted file here and there, changed file here and there.  Did everything I could find including things I've never even heard of. BUT nothing worked.

Spoke to Activision 2 Times!  And they could offer me no fixes but a form to fill out.

&amp;#x200B;

Then it happened.  I came across a comment that suggested a fix that worked for that individual...  **They said they changed their region on bnet before pressing play to Europe.**..  So I say why not, I technically haven't tried that..  And sure enough the game works!!  How is that possible?  That means its a blizzard issue and not a game or computer issue?

Even saw someone say that it fixed it for them, but that when they switched back to their original server it wouldn't work or work again on the Europe server... So I'm not in a rush to attempt that change going to leave it on the EU server indefinitely..  The ping is normal NA ping though for some reason.  So whenever I start getting EU ping is when I'm going to assume its fixed...  I emailed Activision support back with the fix details in hopes they can fix this for everyone else experiencing this issue...  I hope this works for anyone who is unable to play because of this error!",5,1585616251,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs38nr/fatal_error_menu_crash_potential_fix/,modernwarfare,1

Making it more frustrating is that we had played together before, and then one day it just stopped working.

fs303o,nochiso,DEMASCUS CHART: Excel charts for tracking camo progress for Demascus,"What's up all,  just gauging interest here but if I were to share these charts I made in Excel, would anyone be interested in using them?  I'll probably upload the Excel doc to Google docs and share a link tomorrow or the next (maybe someone can fill me in with the *best* way to do this).

Below are pictures of my own progress and use of the charts, along with a description:

[DEMASCUS CAMO TRACKER](https://preview.redd.it/aptsbjbwfwp41.png?width=6164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4230d7577ad1416da198097b550691e9f77b471)

[CLOSE UP OF DEMASCUS TRACKER](https://preview.redd.it/yvp55ocjjwp41.png?width=4318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cd3af632206b8aab958110bf707993ab109e3be)

I made the **Demascus Tracker** when I started going for the Demascus camo and I've been using it to keep track of my progress for every gun as I go along.  Guess you can say I was tired of forgetting what camo I was working on while in-game and wanted a way to see my progress in a ""big-picture"" way (I also just love working with Excel).  I also saw how popular the other charts were for keeping track of gun stats and ads speeds of attachments.

As you can see from the second photo, I also made a tracker for the **Officer Challenges Tracker**.  It's not as helpful as the Demascus tracker is but still, nice to have.  Some people might see this as ""not worth the effort"" but if you're like me and are really into the grind of this game, you might appreciate this and want to use it.

**How it works:**  Simple, as you work towards Gold on each weapon, you update that particular camo's ""kill-count"" box on the far right (*see* photo 3). Every time you earn a camo, you go to the box for it and fill the color (as you can see, I've been using green).  Once you have every camo in a category (e.g. Spray Paint for kills, Woodland for headshots, Topo for mounted, etc.) you mark it with the Gold color.  Finally, once you achieve Gold for the gun, you fill the right side counters in with the GOLD bar, platinum with the PLATINUM bar, and so on.  Honestly, you could do this anyway you'd like if interested. This is just the best way I've found to do it.

**In the works:**  Currently making a tracker on Excel for the Weapon Missions under the Barracks tab (e.g. Boot Camp, Perks of the Job, Warriors Code, etc.).  Also thinking of making an excel sheet for attachment stats of every gun based on some of the YouTube vids from TheXclusiveAce (let me know if either of these have been done already though).

Let me know if you guys are interested.  You can direct message me if you'd like me to send the excel doc to you or as I said before, I may just make post it later with a Google Docs link to it.

**TLDR**; I made a chart to keep track of your camo challenges and officer challenges.  Let me know if you'd like to use it.  May just post it here tomorrow either way.  Also in the works is a tracker for the weapon missions under the barracks tab and a list of attachment stats for all guns.",7,1585615350,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs303o/demascus_chart_excel_charts_for_tracking_camo/,modernwarfare,1

fs1ukh,NOxSOx_,After 162 Hardcore Cabin Fever lobbies,"Me and my friends took advantage of the quarantine and decided to play hardcore cabin fever. Over the past few days I've been keeping track of what maps and game modes are being selected and I decided to make a chart. I have to admit that we didn't play on every lobby we entered and I didn't keep track of how many games i played in total, so if the previous map/game mode  has any ""saying"" over what map/game mode you are placed on the next game then this data is totally irrelevant. I believe I've gathered a statistically accurate sample and I would like to hear your opinions and thoughts.

fs1tru,coolcris,Memory Error 13-71 (PC Fix),"After spending the last 2-hours looking for a fix, and not finding anything that worked, I finally tried something radical. I used the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) app ""Scan and Repair"" tool and it worked. 

I'm not sure if these other actions mattered, but I downloaded the Modern Warfare app on my phone and left the ""Squad"" (seems to be used interchangeably with Regiment) since I read everywhere that Regiments were the culprit of this error. 

I also launched the game in the ""safe mode"" that it prompts. Funny enough, although I left the ""Squad"" on the app, I was still in the Regiment when I finally was able to get in-game. I promptly left the Regiment and have had no issues so far. I will update if anything.

I hope this helps anyone. I'm curious if this works for others.",7,1585611081,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs1tru/memory_error_1371_pc_fix/,modernwarfare,1

When I play Modern Warfare, from time to time, my audio begins to crackle, afterwards my peripherals disconnect(after 10 15 seconds they connect again and everything works fine.) . If I turn off and on the headset when the crackles begin, everything starts to work fine, for 15 or 10 minutes, then it starts again.

Here is what I have figure out.

It only happens on wireless mode. if I connect the headset via USB, everything keeps stable.

it only happens on COD Modern Warfare.

I have over 300hrs in other games. It just happens in COD.

fs0qcl,GIJOEMEERKAT,Why Slug Rounds Are Bad,"I have spent the past couple of days using slugs on all shotguns in the games to see why no one uses them. While there are different problems for each shotgun, here are the problems that are consistent across all shotguns with slugs.

RANGE: The whole point of a shotgun is to be good at CQB. The slugs are supposed to condense all the pellets into one shot that increases the range of the shotgun. However, the bullet velocity is so low that its better to use a sniper at that range. Plus the ads time of the AX50 allows for easy quickscopes

INCONSISTENT: The damage should be powerful enough to kill someone if they are 5 meters away from you. However, i would hit someone pointblack ads in the torso and they would live, but other times i hit someone 30m away and it one shots their leg.

BULLET TRAVEL TIME: Another post had already showed that projectiles disappear if you die before it hits them. The travel time is way too slow to hit someone before they move or they shoot back.

In conclusion, there is no point to running a slug unless you just want to meme. There are so many problems with it that its better to just run a marksman rifle or sniper, even in CQB.",8,1585607156,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs0qcl/why_slug_rounds_are_bad/,modernwarfare,1

I suck at sniping to begin with and can't play well while tired so my stats were abysmal and I was missing shots left and right. Eventually, I started getting kills when I knew for a fact I was off target, and managed to clip one

[https://gfycat.com/harmlessfearfulasianwaterbuffalo](https://gfycat.com/harmlessfearfulasianwaterbuffalo)

my first thought was shitty hitreg, but that makes no sense. How would the server have him all the way over there? On top of that with the range and the damage profile of the Kar98 there's no way the game desynced to where that is a legitimate kill. If you look there's also a bullet impact not where I shoot, but on the doorframe in between my reticle and the person I'm trying to kill. It's like my bullet curved and traveled through the door to kill him.

The thing that makes me skeptical is this happened many times throughout the night, I would be completely off-target and still land the kill. The next day I hopped on and started reg-gunning (and actually putting up numbers) and started noregging like crazy.

I'm not a tinfoil hat kinda guy, but I have never in all my time playing call of duty, or any other id\_tech 3 derivatives, seen something like that happen. The consistency as well, combined with the insane noregs when I was doing well... I'm very skeptical that there's a skill-based hit detection method implemented.

The other option is the server got fucked up so badly that it 1. did not read my correct look angle when I fired or 2. had the guy a full player's width to his right, without it appearing my screen. Granted, it's possible, but that isn't very consistent with how the servers typically perform.

So, Tomorrow well be able to replay one of the best action games ever released in all new High definition.

We'll meet the old gang with a fresh coat of paint; Soap, Price \[the real one\] Ghost \[also the real one\] and who can forget the chiefest character in all call of duty games, RAMIREZ!

No doubt many of us will be disappointed that we wont be seeing a full remaster like COD4  
Those halcyon days of noob tubes and model 1887's will remain forever memories.

But there is something that could be done to reinvigorate what is easily the worst part of the new modern warfare, and in my humble opinion, what was the best part of MW2

SPEC OPS!

Modern Warfare 2 had the magic formula when it came to spec ops. Each mission carefully crafted and considered, each with a unique twist that provided players with a real challenge  
Remember trying to complete Favela on veteran for that 69th star?  
There is no such feeling in Modern Warfare  
spec ops sits in the corner, watching us all have fun in the real multiplayer  
But imagine, loading up the pit, or estate takedown, or exploring prypiat using the glitch in Hidden, ALL IN THE NEW MW!

Infinity ward has shown that they have the capacity to flesh out the weakest part of this iteration of COD. I hope that they think it's worth at least considering",5,1585605238,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fs04yp/a_solution_to_a_long_forgotten_problem/,modernwarfare,1

Unfortunately you have to unblock everyone on the list to get to the console players. so after 2 weeks of me having my son blocked (lol) my wife comes in with the save. hope this helps everyone!!",0,1585604162,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frzstv/blocked_someone_on_pc/,modernwarfare,1

frzrf9,cwfox9,New Gamemode like an objective version of Cranked,"For the objective players out there I feel some gamemode which would either make you have to play the objective or only allow you to play if you hit a certain criteria (not sure on this part, simple objectives/game ratio or maybe a more complex algorithm)  
&amp;nbssp;  

It would be a refreshing mode for the players who want a proper objective game and not a game where half of both teams camp their spawn and the other half camp the enemy spawn and all all time avoiding the objectives other than to kill the captures from behind for easy KD padding  
%nbsp;  

This game is a great objective game and as much as people say it needs incentives the only one you need is W/L however this has never meant enough compared to KD sadly so if the majorities attitude will not change then add a mode which cuts them out, yes I know they'd whine once all the objective players leave the regular mode and every objective mode becomes a KD whore TDM game but meh.

The gun sounds are weaker, the radio chatter was made to sound clearer (although someone is talking to you on a very expensive gaming headset, with nothing going on in the background) and just in general, the sound is quiet. I just watched gameplay of ""Of Their Own Accord"" in MW2R, and i remember the original MW2 being loud, chaotic, and felt like you were in a warzone. In MW2R, everything is quiet, no music, and the radio chatter sounds so clear, whereas I remember the original radio chatter having gun sounds and static in the background.

What I've noticed is that when I watch videos that other players post on reddit, youtube, tiktok, take your pick, the players that they are against ALWAYS seem to be below average for lack of better term. Slow, unaware, and just generally easy to kill. And I notice this when watching average players, all the way to pro players in public matches. 

However every single match I'm ever in, regardless of game mode, is full of the most sweaty, tryhard, pro player wannabes you could imagine. Again, I'm not trying to say I'm a pro, but I'm not bad at COD. I've always been above average amongst the majority. 

To sum it up better, does anyone else notice that other players have fun and can pub stomp, but those pub stompable players are never in their lobby? This happens when my buddies are playing, then I get on and they last a couple more games because now every round we play is super sweaty and they are going very negative and not having fun anymore. 

It's to the point where some long time buddies of 10+ years won't play with me anymore because the lobbies are so much harder and it's very disheartening",16,1585602095,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frz6e8/something_ive_noticed/,modernwarfare,1

fryjsi,NukeEmWins,.458 SOCOM is underpowered.,"I recently starting using the SOCOM rounds on my M4A1 along with a scope to turn it into something like a Marksman Rifle and while it is fun at times, it's also frustrating because it seems underpowered. To prove to you why I think so, I will be comparing its damage profiles (among other things) to the Oden.

&amp;#x200B;

M4A1: SOCOM

* Damage: 48-41
* Shots to kill: 3
* Headshot damage: 77-66
* Rate of fire: 652rpm
* Time to kill: 184ms
* Magazine capacity: 10 rounds
* Reload time: 1.34s
* Aim down sight: 250ms
* Sprintout: 267ms
* Tactical sprintout: 400ms
* Movement speed: 95%
* ADS strafe speed: 50%

&amp;#x200B;

M4A1: Base

* Damage: 28-23-18
* Shots to kill: 4-5-6
* Headshot damage: 45-37-29
* Rate of fire: 833rpm
* Time to kill: 216ms-288ms-360ms
* Aim down sight: 250ms
* Sprintout: 267ms
* Tactical sprintout: 400ms
* Magazine capacity: 30
* Reload time: 1.39s
* Movement speed: 95%
* ADS strafe speed: 50%

&amp;#x200B;

Oden: Base

* Damage: 48-36
* Headshot damage: 77-58
* Shots to kill: 2-3
* Rate of fire: 435rpm
* Time to kill: 138ms-276ms
* Aim down sight: 367ms
* Sprintout: 267ms
* Tactical sprintout: 400ms
* Magazine capacity: 20
* Reload time: 1.95s
* Movement speed: 93%
* ADS strafe speed: 42.5%

&amp;#x200B;

As you can see, SOCOM is basically obsolete when comparing it to the Oden. If we are talking about ballistics the Oden obviously wins. The Oden has a greater damage profile, shots to kill potential, time to kill, and magazine capacity. So, I suggest raising the damage of the SOCOM conversion kit to match the Oden to make it more viable.

&amp;#x200B;

frygpd,Myenia,Will the Operator Pack be available to buy separately ?,"Hi everyone,

I recently played some classic Spec Ops with my friends, and in one of the missions, I could pick up a special variant of the Model 680, the 1337 Skeet. After some research, turns out it's the Crew Expandable shotty from the Operator Pack that I didn't think of buying back then (thinking I'd not stick on MW that much).

Now, I really like how it looks, keeping the wooden stock but darker and more rugged, really nice. But then I learned the OP pack is not available for purchase, and you can't get it anywhere else (apart from rebuying the game in the Battle Pass mode, which is very expensive for a shotty variant and undoable anyway I suppose).

So I just wanted to know if there were plans for the operator pack content to be available either for sale at some point, or unlockable through challenges and all.

Thanks for your consideration.",0,1585599748,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frygpd/will_the_operator_pack_be_available_to_buy/,modernwarfare,1

frxwgt,Black_Midnite,The New Update is Awful,"- Shotguns reduced damage amd cannot down a player with full armor. (Yet, Snipers with a headshot can)

- Less rewards for surviving and avoiding a bounty. (Even though some players are complete navy seals specialists and will completely destroy you because they know where you are all because the bounty shows a general location of where you are on the map)

- Increasing the load out drop to $8,500.

Yes, there are a lot of bug fixes, but there is also a lot of stupid stuff added to the game, like the three mentioned above.

First of all, Shotguns should be able to down a player in one shot with full armor or not. You take a shotgun to the face IRL and let me see you get back up and still fight back. 
Even before this update, most of my shotgun blasts would AT MOST break armor and that's all. It would usually take a 2nd shot to down them anyway. But, of course, COD still rewards those that camp and hide in corners, rather than those that are willing to rush the enemy. (Sure, in real life, you'd want to camp, but this is a game that says armor protects you from a shotgun blast to the face) If shotgun players should be punished, so should snipers, because I've been downed with full armor from a sniper bullet to the face and that is a bunch of B.S. to me, if shotguns can't down players with full armor.

Second, reducing the rewards for surviving a bounty is such a stupid way of telling people that their ability to survive the odds of literally being tracked down and being outed by the very map is not proficient enough to garner sufficient rewards. Bruh, the bunters tracking the prey should get less money, or they should change the tracking system to something like HUNT or EVLOVE, which makes it fun and intense to track/be tracked.

Third, I understand you want to prolong the amount of time of people getting their loadouts, so they have to either search for more money or sacrifice their greed for the benefit of the team to up the odds of survivability. But, why make it harder on us, when $6,000 was a good enough sum. Sometimes it's difficult enough to get that much money, because you might land in a bad spot. But, if you want to hold out on giving people their load out, then have less money or make bounties and scavengers less money rather than upping the price you capitalist pigs! Oink! Oink!

Honestly, give us a hardcore survivor mode or take out loadouts in another game mode. There is so much you could do that would actually make it so much harder and more fun! Instead, you just decide to really screw over players.

I've player on both PS4 and PC and the servers are awful, with lagging and connecting to friends being a hassle sometimes.

frxsqh,MissingColon,Is this the last modern warfare?,"I really do wonder if this one will be the last. I think we are in a time where yearly game releases are not really a thing anymore (or at least they shouldn't be). I think it's easier for gamers to keep progression and skills for a game they play on one game. Look at all the big titles out there that just add updates to one game with full support for the future.  


I think that was one of the big things that lead me to buy a computer. I played league of legends for over 8 or so years now and can go back at any time and see all my stats/games/progression, etc... and I love it. It encourages me to go back to a game if I know it won't have a new one every time I go back to it. I felt like every time I wanted to go try out COD I could not simply just go back to the game that I wanted to play. One year it's black ops, the next some type of warfare game.  


It also feels refreshing when you game comes out with big updates that really improve it, not just pushing things to the side because they know they'll come out with a new game within a year. I feel like updates have been coming out regularly and it is making me think they are going too long time support this COD MW.   


One last thing I should mention is that when I am forced to spend $60 every time a new COD comes out it makes it a lot less appealing to spend money on. Something what happens is I go back to play COD and there is only a couple months left in the year and I know they will likely release a new one so I decide to not buy it, and then in turn end up just never playing COD.

frxi8v,P_MickG,Xbox Game Bar on PC -- DVR issue with audio/clipping,"I use the Game Bar to DVR any crazy kills/clips that happen while I'm playing. Whenever something happens, after I get the kill I'll hit Win+Alt+G to capture my last 10 minutes of gameplay.


I had no issues with this feature when I did it on Fortnite or Tarkov, but for some reason when I do it on MW, the first time I do it in a gaming session it works fine. But then if I do it again a few matches later for something that happened, the Game Bar doesn't pick up the game audio, or the players in my party. (Even tho it picked all that up for the first clip).


I went into the settings and made sure nothing had changed from the way I had it, and it was all the same.


Also, occasionally I will save the clip, then go to watch it and it did not even capture the proper timeframe.


Wondering if anyone else had this issue, or has a suggestion of another program they use for the DVR feature, since this bug is very annoying when I do something cool and the clip has no audio, or the clip is not even capturing the timeframe where the kill happened.


TL;DR: Xbox game bar DVR audio not working properly. Settings are not the problem. Anyone have an idea why? Anyone use a different DVR program?",0,1585596808,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frxi8v/xbox_game_bar_on_pc_dvr_issue_with_audioclipping/,modernwarfare,1

What I have done so far is to exit the Blizzard app, but couldn't see any ""Agent.exe"" running in the taskbar. I then decided to restart my PC. That didn't work either. I then scanned the game for repairs. It did it's thing but the game still won't update.

It starts updating but after a few seconds the numbers freezes like nothing is happening. Then I get the error message that I mentioned above.

Should I just uninstall the game and reinstall it?

frw2yi,Joe_Roh,Joined Broken Regiment But Can Still Play," I joined a random broken regiment but I am still able to play.

I also accepted a random regiment invite last night. I am still able to play and just wanted to mention some things about the situation.

Platform: Xbox

Game Owned: Regular Modern Warfare including WarZone

Name Of Regiment Joined: \[S\~CK\] KOS OMAK (Side note, I learned what this means while search google..I wouldn‚Äôt have joined originally lol)

I accepted the invite last night and when I tried to open the regiment it forced the game to the COD load screen. I panicked and as a precaution I force quit the game by pressing the xbox button and pressing start on the game selecting quit. I tried opening the regiment a few more times and it did the same thing. I even let it load out back to the menu and went back into the game. 

At the time I was a member of 4 other regiments and an owner of my own. When I selected to leave the infected regiment it would remove me from one of the others. I repeated this leaving the others hoping it would finally let me leave the infected one. My current status is that I‚Äôm still in my own regiment which I have ownership of and it‚Äôs set to default and still a member of the infected one which appears below it. Now when I try to leave the infected regiment I get an error ‚Äú Cannot Delete Regiment - You need to be the only member in a regiment to delete it. You can transfer ownership if you desire.‚Äù

I guess I got lucky not getting the ‚ÄúMemory 13 -71 Error‚Äù since I have ownership of my own regiment? I‚Äôm mentioning this mostly to hope support sees it and hope maybe it can help someone else.

**Console A** is my primary console, has PS Plus active and is the activated console where I make all purchases.  Never use this console to play the free games.  


**Console B** is the console I use to play all games purchased by **Console A**, including the free games like Apex, Fornite and now WarZone.  Do not have PS Plus for this console since we use **Console A** to buy games.

Which console do I need to purchase MW on in order to have the unlocks carry over to my WarZone account on **Console B**?

So I downloaded and installed the Warzone game first, on my xbox one. This has worked fine until now and I'm at lvl 97. The game is so damn good that wanted to purchase the full version of the game.  
I bought a physical copy, since I had a gift card I hadn't used yet.

Here's the problem:  
When I got home I inserted the disc to start installation. The only thing that happens when I do that is that Warzone opens, and asks me if I want to buy COD MW. Pressing this directs me to the store.  
I tried to restart, and the same thing happens. When I insert the disc it opens the Warzone game, and I'm unable to install or play MW main game.

Anyone with a solution would be much appreciated.",3,1585589244,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frv2rb/help_cant_install_game/,modernwarfare,1

fruayq,silenthills13,Just some random thoughts on the quality of this game's management.,"So, first of all, I'm by no means a hardcore CoD player. This is the first one in ten years that I've bought - right after launch, too. I believe the last few ones died after a couple months on PC and I'm a PC player. I've been playing for half a year now, on and off, and I've got some thoughts so I thought I would maybe throw in something on a positive note.

I'm pretty sure there's a lot of negativity running around this sub and I tend to avoid shooter subs altogether (PUBG sub probably left some permanent damage on my brain). Looking at the whole picture though, I really think this might be the best thought out and managed CoD in years. Maybe ever.

Yes, there are issues that probably should be fixed, but if you're not a perfectionist you tend to appreciate how the whole picture looks - and let me tell you, I've played most popular shooters in the past years and none came even close to being a balanced, well running and fun game. Not only that, it's got tons of content and that's not just fillers - that's maps, guns, modes, campaign is really decent and the general feel that there's always something to do in this game is there. Which is really cool. Even though some people have a dislike for some maps, I'm pretty sure there's a much less vocal group that quietly enjoys most of them. Yes, I do like Picadilly, I love Shoot House - and despise Shipment. I'm just saying this to point out how well this game appeals to different players, everyone has their niche they can have fun with.

Then there's Warzone, which probably is the best BR currently available in the market. PUBG is good, but it works like shit, Apex is decent, but it kinda lacks the X factor for a lot of people. Warzone is a cool middle ground. It's well made, maybe a little unbalanced when it comes to weapons but that's not very annoying.

And now they're dropping the MW2 remaster, and while this is not directly within MW2019, I assume it's going to be strongly interlinked. We know for sure that there will be a really cool skin, but I think we're also gonna be getting MW2 multi maps. If this happens, I honestly think the only bad thing about this game will be servers and lack of map voting.

If you played other games, you might have noticed how trash MW2019 servers are. I don't know if they're like 5 tick or what, but sometime the game just doesn't behave like it should. Especially in Warzone you can also encounter some mega rubberbanding, when you can't run forward or change direction. They're mitigating it well, but not well enough. 

And the map voting - does anybody know, why that's still not in the game? It's crazy that I have to play shipment 5 times in a row, while people are complaining they're not getting it.

To end it on a question. I wonder, do you think they're going to change up their model of launching a new game every year? Honestly at this point MW2019 is in such a full swing it would be a waste to just publish another CoD in 4 months or something. This is a great opportunity to keep this one game alive, it should keep the money stream flowing for some time especially with the free BR, and it would also give developers more time to polish upcoming iterations, so that maybe next CoD could be launched autumn 2021. 

What do you think about the game, in general? Especially as a long time CoD player, is this one really as good as it feels compared to others?

Why in there right mind would they add modern warfare 2 remaster multiplayer? There is no way in hell  activision or infinity ward would sign off on that.

frszg5,dshelz1,BS Final Ring Happens WAY too often!,"Here the other team had high ground on the edge of the map and we couldn't get up there despite trying our hardest for the last 10 minutes of the game. The area sealed off super quickly but one team had this absurdly OP spot. They didn't even need to peek if they didn't want to. Look at this BS!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj4k3826ujc&amp;feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj4k3826ujc&amp;feature=share)

The same exact thing almost happened here, later in the day as well. However, the dude luckily peeked and we were able to secure a victory. Look at how the ring shut us out again in the most annoying possible way.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fhOWA42t2c&amp;feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fhOWA42t2c&amp;feature=share)

Conclusion: Some of these final rings are really really ridiculous. We should never not be able to access the middle of the final ring where it is constantly moving in at the end.

Edit: Forgive the click-baity titles on my YouTube page. I am very new to streaming/posting clips and am trying to get some views/attention.

Latest Nvidia Driver with SAFE MODE CLEAN INSTALL  --  took longer for a crash to happen

CPU problem, whatever is going to fix it  --  OC off, still crashes

Flip PSU upside down...

IT""S FIXED...

&amp;#x200B;

**-TL;DR:**

The truth is, if it's your PSU not able to deliver stable current and voltage to your GPU and CPU, it's gonna crash at some point.

My computer's power supply unit was installed with the fan facing downward to the floor at the bottom of my PC case.  Turns out it is a problem.  It's getting too hot, preventing it from delivering stable power to my GPU when playing MW.

It's being 3 days, I have yet to experience any crashes whatsoever, not just from MW.  The little freezes or glitches overall has also disappeared...

&amp;#x200B;

**-Story of how I figured this out...:**

Some guy a long time ago posted a thread somewhere that he moved his graphics card to a different PCI-E slot and fixed the problem.

So I tried that and moved my GPU to my second PCI-E slot, which is X8, half the FPS, didn't bother to wait for it to crash, I can't sit &amp; play when I can get double the FPS.  So I decided to put it back where it was.

IT WAS ALMOST F\*\*\*ING BURNING.

When I had it in the first slot, it had never gone this hot.  And I only ran MW for 10 min before I decided to abort this operation.

What's the difference between my second PCI-E slot and the first PCI-E slot other than their speed?

It's only an inch away from the no-fan-side of my PSU.

frrvm5,bloueddeu,Is there a way to enjoy the game with 1-2 friends?,"Hey, so everytime I group with my one or two friends to play MW, I noticed that the 'quick play' option was unavailable since it tells us to reduce the party size to 1. As so we are only forced to queue for 2-man ground war, gunfight, and some other default queuing options in the main lobby, which doesn't seem to accept 3-man group for ground war as well.
But what we want to play are the various other game modes such as cyberattack or cranked confirm kill and so on, which doesn't look like possible to queue for 2/ 3man group.

Please understand its our first time in the franchise and as I am not a native speaker I am wondering maybe the option to play w/ friends is just there but lost in translation or sth?

frovsh,aisofdbisofd,Gunfight / game issues.,"So it's been multiple times I've been shoved into a losing match of gunfight. Recently I was put into a match all by myself losing 4:1 with 2 enemies because the two previous players had left but I joined during the 30 second countdown.
1. Do NOT allow players to join midgame Gunfight matches. Gunfight is about competition really, there is nothing competitive in joining an already losing side ALONE against 2 players. It doesn't prove anything if the other side wins since you were already at a loss you didn't cause. Just remove mid match joining entirely from CoD MW 2019, not worth losing more matches and lowering K/D stats by simply having smaller queue time.
2. Remove the 30 second countdown completely if you're not removing mid match joining. As I said Gunfight is competitive and if both opponents leave, you win by default. It's quite annoying having to wait 30 seconds for another enemy to join instead of taking your earned win as one probably outskilled their enemies to the point of leaving. Or if they disconnected? Simply add a feature which separates manually disconnected players and network disconnected players. Seen it done in other games, (For Honor for example) shouldn't be a problem to introduce.

With these 2 points I'd say Gunfight would be much much better. For me it is a competition and so is it for many others but I don't sweat it. However, it'd still be better as I would rather take my earned win after beating my enemies until they leave over getting a new player who might be so good they would turn the table around and force me a loss I didn't deserve. It's quite simply unfair. And the 30 sec countdown after both enemies leave is annoying. If you'll remove the mid game joining, what's the point? Unless you're going to add a feature of joining back disconnected games, there's no point to it. I've just listed out several things you can add:
1. Joining back disconnected games. 
2. Separating network and manual disconnecting
3. A penalty for manually leaving the game, works best with point 2. added.
Afterall this is my opinion and I have rushed this because I am quite annoyed at how bad Gunfight has been made and even other matches. You can even add an option of allowing or disallowing joining matches in progress.
4. Option for joining matches in progress.

Continuing about my struggle, Gunfight is not the only place where I've been forced into whilst it's already playing. Even Hardcore games!! Not only core but hardcore! The proper competitive gamemode where you find tryhards and sweats, you try and prove your skill or like me, rank up more weapons which do more damage to less health. Yet you can still somehow join those matches in progress and it's always on the losing side. I don't like having my K/D ruined just because I was forced into a match I didn't want to play, it's already below 1 (at 0.97) so I don't want it lower.",5,1585566856,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frovsh/gunfight_game_issues/,modernwarfare,1

frmzk7,Just-Bioinformatics,"IW, please fix this (introduces since 1.13)","Dear graphics team at IW and Reddit community,

Ground War, Spec Ops and Warzone actually have a minor graphical problem which can have a huge impact at some situations.
Since update 1.13, the developers significantly downgraded the graphics of the Spec Ops, Ground War and Warzone maps across all platforms, including the high-end console (PS4 Pro and Xbox One X). 

The following features of the engine were CRIMINALLY adjusted after update 1.13 without a single word from the developers:

- Significantly reduced the quality of the volumetric lighting 
- Significantly reduced object reflections
- Reduced the draw distance and the density of object across the whole map
- Significantly reduced the texture quality of the ground, walls and objects across the whole map
- Decreased shadow quality 
- Decreased shadow draw distance (appears as pixelated cubes from distance) 
- Player shadows rendered at 30fps at some spots inside buildings
- Significantly reduced the rendering circle around player from 40-60m to &lt;5m (huge impact shadow and foliage draw distance, mainly foliage) here is an example image: https://ibb.co/sP5jDxD
- Foliage only renders up to 8 meters around the players, which results in massive object pop-ins
- Significantly reduces draw distance of foliage (tall grass looks like counter strike 1.6)
- More overal object pop-in, including blurred-out buildings from distance

Hereby some evidence of pre- and post 1.13 update:

https://ibb.co/LP0bzm8

https://ibb.co/2W2tfqv

https://ibb.co/YTTdFS2

https://ibb.co/8BZYHrM

https://ibb.co/jHXKsDj

These kind of optimizations are indeed required for 150 player modes. However, it can be resolved by increasing the rendering circle back to 60-100 meters but slightly dropping the texture quality of some lower-end systems to maintain performance (This used to be the case before patch 1.13). For instance, the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X can have much higher quality when compared to the lower end systems. Same goes for PC players.

Please revert the graphics as it was after launch. I think it‚Äôs very unprofessional to advertise good looking graphics for 2 months post-launch and then downgrade. Performance issues were not present on PC and the higher-end consoles (PS4 PRO and Xbox One X) before the graphical downgrade. 

To make things even worse, why in hell did the developers think they could adjust the graphics of Ground War and Spec Ops? Was it too difficult for them to separately optimize Warzone from an already working game mode? 
Ground War and Spec Ops looked decent, yet the graphics has been massively downgraded as well, for absolutely no reason!

frmq1k,PlasticHasMemory,Game Suddenly Performs Worse Than Before.,"Specs:

GPU: RX 580 8GB (FACTORY)

CPU: FX-8350 (FACTORY)

RAM: 24GB DDR3

So I have run system benchmarks to see if it was a hardware issue, I rank above average on all stress tests. I run the game on everything low except textures which I keep on high. The game runs in fullscreen too!

I played a couple of weeks ago with 80-100 FPS with my settings in standard game modes and was extremely pleased with its performance. But I uninstalled due to it taking too much HDD space. A few days ago I got an EXTERNAL HDD to store my important files (I'm a music production student), and around that time I got a BR itch and wanted to try warzone. I reinstalled the game and was getting 40 fps in Warzone. Sure, it's a BR and it's using more power from my machine to render more things on my screen, so I let it slide and decided that it was too much to ask for 60fps. So I returned to playing quickplay and had \~40 FPS as an average (according to AMD's Adrenalin software). It's confusing to get worse performance on maps where I had averaged 90-100 FPS.

So here's what I've done: 

1. I've uninstalled and reinstalled.
2. Scanned (But never repaired since the scan came clean)
3. Reinstalled shaders because I paused the installation the first time and kept playing so I reinstalled just to be sure. (Also uninstalled the game and reinstalled and waited for shaders to optimize again)
4. Drivers were already up to date but I've checked anyways.

My Radeon Settings are default, and other games run perfectly (R6, CSGO, DayZ, ARMA 3, DMC5)

frmixb,DarkHorse786,What happened to the scoring?,"So I don't know if you've noticed this or care about it but it's obvious at this point that if you play with randoms no one is playing the objectives during Domination, Kill Confirmed, Hardpoint, Headquarters, etc. Atleast whatever team I join seem more interested in turning these matches into TDM and getting the most kills since TDM itself is a camping infested nightmare now. Also, why is it when I am playing objective, the points you're given or the scoring is way less rewarding than if I just went around shooting people, this isn't how it used to be. I'll have captured flags in domination 15 times, have a good amount of kills and assists, decent deaths, but you know who gets the top positions? People who have captured the flag once or at times not even once but have been running around just killing not playing the objective at all, and the scoring system basically encourages them to play this way as well since it doesn't matter if you play the objective anymore or not, get the most kills and you're rewarded. Same with Hardpoint, spent almost 2 whole minutes on Hardpoint and the reward is given to someone whose spent 0.02 seconds on the Hardpoint. Kill Confirmed has nigh become useless, as I end up being the only one collecting tags as the tags no more count towards the score like they used to, even kill confirmed is now based on number of kills, not collecting the tags, a mode that specifically used to depend more on number of tags collected and denied in the past.",13,1585554242,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frmixb/what_happened_to_the_scoring/,modernwarfare,1

frm6d4,dogtreat07,100 Lobbies of Cabin Fever,"The other day I noticed a user post a result of 100 lobbies of Cabin Fever via graph to illustrate the map breakdown. I decided to do the same as I was getting pretty frustrated that each map isn't just being given a 20% breakdown.

I would say 5% of the GR lobbies were with the same people who were backing out and trying to find a different match. The twitter post from Infinity Ward made it seem like each map had an equal likelihood of appearing but obviously many users are not experiencing that with the appearance of an inordinate amount of Gun Runner and Hackney Yard. I also am completely aware that the prevalence of those two maps is likely due to people like me who are 'lobby surfing' however, even given a deviation of \~5-10% it's still **heavily skewed towards Hackney and Gun Runner.**

**I'd love to be able to vote in this playlist, or at least have an equal chance of getting each map.**

before i did this i had constant packet loss about 30 to several hundred % on really good internet.

now i have a rock solid 0.

key is that you set udp connections to 0 and tcp to atleast 2 (i recommend 4 unless you have really bad internet) as for the game region, just use whatever is the closest location to where you live and it should be fine.

I spoke to him how to connect to wifi on the xbox and its all clear it says he is connected.

frl5v1,Logic-DL,Anyone else feel like the AK-47 and SA87 are just outclassed in every way?,"* They both feel super slow to ADS with (even with every ADS speed increase attachment)
* They both have stupidly slow fire rates (at least the AK can increase it's firerate with the 5.45x39 mags)
* Both are outclassed by every other gun in their category for the most part
* Both have RIDICULOUS recoil even with an angled grip (unless you wanna watch a movie while you wait for the gun to ADS)

&amp;#x200B;

I mean why should I actually use the AK over the Kilo, M13 or M4? in every engagement where I've shot first and the enemy starts shooting immediately after or at the same time, I have ALWAYS lost with the SA87 and AK if the enemy so much as has an M4, Kilo or M13

&amp;#x200B;

Are they going to get a buff? because they really need a slight damage buff if they're going to keep the same fire rate.

&amp;#x200B;

The ONLY saving grace the SA87 has imo is that putting the 60 rounder isn't detrimental as it stops that MORONIC slapping the magazine in animation and actually makes your reload faster",45,1585547031,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frl5v1/anyone_else_feel_like_the_ak47_and_sa87_are_just/,modernwarfare,1

frkid2,Timmyan,The future of game release cycles,"Today the COD games are mainly being developed by Infinity Ward, Raven Software, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games.

Black Ops 5 (or whatever the name will be) coming in 2020 is being developed by Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games, as far as the leaks tell us.

Since there are four developers in total, I could easily believe that the COD games will have a two year gap after BO5 is out, and that there will be two developers on each game. 

More people + more time = better game in general.. right? Well I hope so.

Games should in theory be able to have a longer life span now, as games today dont get outdated in a year (usually). Usually a COD game is only popular for a year.. and then gets less popular real quick thereafter, mostly due to there being a new COD game every single year, which in my opinion is way too often. If they have two years of the same game they will (most likely) earn more from the game and it will last longer with the right amount of content and updates.

frjsc1,MyAltFun,The PROBLEM with constant SBMM,"  I have been using the JOKR as my primary for two- TWO!! days now and yet I have not gotten into any easier lobbies, and if anything, it almost seems like my lobby's are filled with even sweatier, campy, no-lifes that lie to talk trash on everyone when they win, as if I wasn't trying to level up my JOKR first and my 725  as an afterthought. These are my last 2 weapons to max out before I work on camos. I have gotten nearly twice as many deaths as kills in almost every single game, yet all I have played against is guys who think the spot behind the car in Khandor Hideout is their bedroom while in isolation.
  I just played a game where I spawned in front of, or just around the corner from at least 1 enemy. Every. Single. Time.  Without fail, every time. Now, in normal Hardcore, that means you die, unless the enemy is trash. But they never were. Now, if my last 5 games are anything to go by, my highest K/D was 1, and I got 7 kills. My highest kills was the one where people with racist or racial slur names were camping or spawn trapping or camping, and I finally had enough, so pulled out a decent rifle the last 2 minutes of the game and nearly evened the score solo, I still only got 24/25 K/D. My most kills in 2 days. 
  ""Why does all this matter? You are just pissed because you suck."" No, I am pissed because I worked for 1.5 weeks to max out the shield because the average K/D of everyone I faced was over 2, where mine during that time was under .9, because screw came challenges. The same goes with these past 2 days. No matter how poorly I do because I have to grind this out, I cannot find a lobby without overweight neckbeards sweating in timeout in their corners, or the 114lb teen who hasn't seen daylight in 3 months bunny hopping around a corner while I am still chambering rounds because I just spawned. 
  I don't expect easy lobbies, but I should not still be in my usual lobbies hating every moment I have to slog through my rapidly lowering K/D in order to level the worst launcher THIRTY-ONE TIMES! Why not just let me unlock all the camo categories 1 level after another?! Or put me in lower skill lobbies with people that use Personal Radars often. Or just get rid of SBMM in everything but Ranked! If I wanted to play with my equals, I usually do, I would play ranked every day of the week. 
  Even better idea, playlist update: JOKR only, killstreaks constantly spawning, who ever has most destroys/kills wins.  And before anyone asks, I normally play GW, but since chumps in their superior gaming chairs abused the ammo depots with the JOKR, and I wasn't about to jump into that cheaty bandwagon, I find it nigh impossible to have enough rockets to take down anything before FMJ+LMG users take down every little killstreak, or the PILA beats my rocket by 7 years.",0,1585540550,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frjsc1/the_problem_with_constant_sbmm/,modernwarfare,1

So we can be as close to Mw2 as we possibly can.

Far to often to start games and be killin everyone get to maybe 10 and 1 or 10 and 2 then quite seriously die 8 to 9 times in a row from being spawned behind or spawning in front of a teammate whose being shot.

fri6un,8InchMale,Warzone constantly crashed my Pc and now it‚Äôs showing no display.,"So I have been enjoying warzone quite a bit but it keeps crashing my Pc once every three games. This only happens on waffarzone and not regular game modes like dom or ffa. My specs are ryzen 5 3600, 5700xt and 16gb ddr4 3200mhz ram. I lowered my settings and turned the fans up to max speed to see if it was a heat issue or a lack of power. So for the past few days it crashes and when rebooting the pc the fans are spinning the LED lights are working, but there is no signal on the monitor. Today I have tried  to reboot about 40 times maybe but still no signal. Here are the diagnostic steps I have followed so far.

1 Use a different monitor + make sure the current monitor is on, properly plugged in and working. It is not a monitor issue.
2 I have drained the power from the pc after unplugging everything.
3 I have unplugged the gpu and cleaned the slot.
4 cleaned the ram and ports and switched up which slots I put the ram in. 
5 I have reset the cmos battery, this made the pc worked yesterday but no chances of it working today.
6 I connected the monitor to the motherboard instead of gpu.
After all of these steps it still shows no signal.
Has warzone killed my Pc? If there is anything else I can try please let me know this is a Pc I built with parts from different places and if it happens to be a hardware issue it would take too long to fix the problem especially since we‚Äôre facing a pandemic.",1,1585533846,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/fri6un/warzone_constantly_crashed_my_pc_and_now_its/,modernwarfare,1

frgruh,Elvexa,Infinity Ward makes really bad maps... Like literally a campers paradise.,"I feel like this game has the all time wost cod maps i've ever played on in any cod ever. F\*ck, just let them use the Black Ops maps in their game, it'd actually be really fun. Also why not let Infinity Ward use the Black Ops killstreaks, cause those are actually worth going for.  


This game feels like it was built for pussy campers, it punishes the fun fast paced cod playstyle that i've come to love. Theres like 2 maps that are actually fun for running and gunning, and even those maps have people hiding all over and you have to hunt them down.  


Even the f\*cking gun camo challenges are telling players to GO CROUCH and get 200 kills, or set up your gun on the ledge and sit there and wait for someone to walk in your line of sight... This shit is so fucking boring, why encourage players to camp that hard? At least back in Black Ops 3 you had proper flanking routes, and you could double jump around a corner to snag the kill on campers... But in this game you can BARELY see people that are camped up.  


All in all, I feel like the game had potential to be really fun, but they f\*cked it up with some bad maps and campy-ness. Hide and seek is not how I play COD. Dark Matter was fun to get and worth getting in BO3, but the final camos in this game don't even look good, and theres no way in hell I am going for ""crouching kills"" or the kills where you ""set your gun on the ledge"".",17,1585528348,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/frgruh/infinity_ward_makes_really_bad_maps_like/,modernwarfare,0

I don't like this idea simply because then it'll be the same maps Everytime. Shoothouse, shipment, and rust. Everytime they appear. It happens in every game. There are a couple of maps that people like and they are played to death. It gets tiring for me, I may be solo on this opinion though. My thought would be to play every map in order. No skips, no votes. Just play each map and then after all maps have been played, repeat the order. Every map is played an equal amount of times.

frf0k5,RuggedSavior,Headquarters is the worst mode (for objective players),"The first reason for why I believe it is the worst involves the scoring system.  When you capture the headquarters, it says that you got 200 points, but the scoreboard only registers 100.  You can get kills for that same amount, which explains why regardless of how many captures people get, the slayers will always have a higher score.

The second reason is because the scoreboard is bugged. I'll play a match of headquarters and secure 4-5 objectives, but I only end up having one or two on the scoreboard.  Sometimes the person who didn't even get near the headquarters will have multiple captures for some reason.  

The third reason is because although there is one objective, the mode itself is more based on slaying than it is capturing.  There's not enough of a constant objective in comparison to other modes like hardpoint and domination.  Headquarters? More like team deathmatch with an objective to stand on once in awhile.

My solutions would be to fix the scoreboard to accurately represent who played the objectives.  I also personally think the scoring for securing the HQ should be much higher and also based on your participation.  Defending the HQ should be more rewarding when respawns are disabled.  Lastly, although this can be debated, but what if the HQ became available a lot more quickly, in addition to allowing the area to be captured and destroyed more quickly?  This would encourage more movement and objective play.

frew8y,GreyWolfCenturion,Cabin Fever Map Rotation,"First I'll say that this playlist update is an ENORMOUS improvement over last week, but I've still got a gripe or two, primarily with the Cabin Fever mode.

Gun Runner and Hackney Yard are both perfectly good maps, but they are by NO means small.  They stand out pretty awkwardly in the mix, even after the update to increase the amount of Rust and Shipment we see.  I'd happily play them in a mix with Vacant and Ramaza, but they aren't the hectic mess you get in Rust or Shipment, and they aren't even classic CoD meat-grinders like Shoot House.

I've been pulling for map filters since day one.  I know it's quite likely a pipe dream, but filters would let players pick their own experience rather than having to make do with whatever the devs throw us from week to week, and all the bickering over maps and playlists would disappear.

And on top of all this, I do not want to play TDM or KC.  I know some people like the modes, but I don't.  But if I want to see the maps I prefer, I have to deal with a moshpit of modes I never turn on in normal matchmaking filters.  Why do we have to play moshpit to play these maps?  And without a vote in the matter?  It's obnoxious, unnecessary, and seriously reduces my enjoyment of the game, as I'm sure it does for others.

I like this game, and a lot, but I'm losing my patience with the devs.  The erratic playlist shifts are ridiculously annoying.  It feels like the game is using my enjoyment of its mechanics and progression to try and press me into playing modes and maps I don't want to.  The limitations of choice are totally arbitrary and I just want to have control of the maps I see just as much as the modes I play.

One of the the things I‚Äôd like your input on is which missions should I focus on first? Specifically the missions that will get me blueprints. Which are the best ones?

Also, anything I could do to level up BP tiers faster?

Get 10 Kills With  A Pistol

Get 20 Point Blank Kills.
All five days I‚Äôve done the challenges and nothing. I‚Äôm about to start again today to see if it tracks this time. This has happened before to me and usually on the 3rd day the challenges start tracking but 5 days? It‚Äôs pretty infuriating, and it bothers me so much that my challenges never seem to get track.
