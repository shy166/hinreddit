fsofmg,GManBoyd,New PC build - i7-9700k or wait for 10700k?,"I’ve been thinking of building a new PC again, currently using an i5 7600k but I want to go for an i7 in the new build, question is do I go for a 9700k now or wait for the 10700k which is due soon enough? I believe 10700k will be 8 core/16 threads with hyper threading but will it really be worth it is the question :)",35,1585699100,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fsofmg/new_pc_build_i79700k_or_wait_for_10700k/,buildapc,1
fsofhe,jakethesnake0619,Need Advice on my Gaming Build,"So I've always wanted to build a PC, and I've saved up about 2000 dollars for my build. I would like a relatively high end PC that can run almost all modern games in 4K 60 fps. Ive made a list at PC part picker and I would really appreciate some feedback on my build.

fsociq,SaxonShieldwall,Old computer stopped working,"I was hoping to refurbish an old computer but it won’t start, the power cable doesn’t seem to be a problem because I let a friend use it a day before and it has power going in there because the mouses LED lights up, all the wires look fine but I haven’t checked fully behind the hood yet, any tips?",11,1585698787,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fsociq/old_computer_stopped_working/,buildapc,1
fsoc2k,PineappIeRasengan,Can I have some help making this overall better and a little bit cheaper,"I’m considering a ryzen 5 1600af, Asrock b450m pro4, a seagate barracuda 2tb hdd, a Adata 240gb ssd, a msi gtx 1650 super, a Corsair vengeance 2x8 no rgb ram, a thermal take 500w 80+ white, and a focus g case.

fsobum,empacher-,2070 Super performing terribly,"I just installed a 2070 super today. My build is Ryzen 7 1700, Asus Prime b350 plus, 16gb of 2666mhz ram, 650w corsair psu and 2070 super. 

Before this I had a 4gb rx580. In every comparison video I watched the 2070 had double the fps of the rx 580. Currently it is only getting about 20-30 fps better than what my 580 was getting. 

I spent some time on live chat going through Nvidia control panel settings and it helped a small bit but nothing huge. I also clean reinstalled all the drivers.

Does anyone have any ideas? The live chat support said they will contact me by email. Is my cpu bottlenecking the 2070? When I checked a calculator online it said it would only bottle it by 10%. However at the moment it is still only getting have the fps as expected.",20,1585698720,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fsobum/2070_super_performing_terribly/,buildapc,1
fsobhq,spacerl_,Using a fan splitter with the b450 DS3H,I'm trying to use a 1 to 3 fan splitter with this motherboard as it only has one fan header. The splitter I purchased is [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FNL8YCZ/ref=twister_B07FNNHT5L?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1). Upon plugging it in none of my fans are spinning. Does the Motherboard not have enough power for this or what could the problem be.,0,1585698687,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fsobhq/using_a_fan_splitter_with_the_b450_ds3h/,buildapc,1
fsoalo,Brothengar,How to move hard drive to new pc,"So my PC died , going to build a new one , I'm keeping my ssd and selling the rest , when I build a new pc what's the best way to set it up and keep my files ? 

Do I plug in HD and just boot it, or do I put a new drive in first and give it fresh windows and then hook up the old drive and move stuff off etc ? 

What's the best way to go about this ?",13,1585698600,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fsoalo/how_to_move_hard_drive_to_new_pc/,buildapc,1

fso8x7,kreempuffpt,Should I upgrade my ram or get an SSD?,"I'm looking to upgrade my very old (almost 7 years) custom built PC. Here are my specs:

* Intel Core i3 3240
* EVGA Geforce GTX 660 (2gb)
* 8.00GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 665MHz
* ASRock H77M
* Toshiba 1TB Hard Drive

The main things I want to upgrade are my mobo and CPU. I'm pretty much settled on getting a Ryzen 5 2600x with a combo motherboard from here:  [https://www.microcenter.com/product/505629/amd-ryzen-5-2600x-36ghz-6-core-am4-boxed-processor-with-wraith-spire-cooler](https://www.microcenter.com/product/505629/amd-ryzen-5-2600x-36ghz-6-core-am4-boxed-processor-with-wraith-spire-cooler) 

It seems like some combos from the link above include an SSD for a decent price and I know I'm way behind the times in using only a mechanical drive. But also I feel like my ram is holding me back a lot.

The main games I want to play are Battlefield 3/4, COD Warzone, Fortnite, Minecraft, Planetside 2. I don't care about having the highest settings. If I can run at 1080p 60fps that would be fantastic. Is my ram bad enough to hold me back in these games and should I upgrade that? Or should I get with the times and get an SSD and buy better ram later?",12,1585698435,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/fso8x7/should_i_upgrade_my_ram_or_get_an_ssd/,buildapc,1
