fsodju,UniqueMemoir,"GPU being disabled after BSOD, Error 43","Hello everyone!So I've been having issues with my laptop lately (Lenovo Y50-70, GTX 960M, +5 years old). Ever since a few days ago, I've been getting a BSOD.

Today, I've been getting it more frequently, and when I check my device manager, Windows disables my GPU and says it's ""Error 43"". So I do a clean install of my GPU drivers, but it still does it.

The way it goes, more specifically, is that when I Alt-Tab from a game, my computer freezes for a bit (can still move my mouse though) and then I get a BSOD. After that, same thing, disabled GPU. So again, I do a clean install, I got to game for a couple of hours, but again, when I alt-tabbed, freezes, crashes, and then disabled GPU.

When I go into Reliability History, it says : Hardware Error, Live Kernel Event, Code 141 (or 1b0 sometimes)

Would it be worth trying to do clean reinstallation of Windows?

Is this the sign of a dying GPU?

fsock1,Kiru4444,PC will not turn on at all,"Hey guys, my friend's PC will not turn on at all. To give a little bit of context, we were switching the components over from an old case to a new case that he bought. When we tried to turn it on, it didn't turn on. No boot, no fans spinning for a second and then turning off, nothing. I tried checking to see if it's the power supply that had died by doing the paperclip test, but the PSU actually turned on and was working fine. Then I tried to check if the wires were the problem by plugging everything in firmly. Nothing. 

I'm thinking the motherboard is the culprit cause I've seen a leak and I did smell something burning, but it was near the bottom of the motherboard/near the PSU. I don't know how to confirm that it is in fact the motherboard that is at fault. Even if it is, ASUS support won't pick up (thanks COVID-19) and their website, for some reason, won't let me submit an RMA. 

I'm completely lost on what to do.

AMD Ryzen 7 2700X

MSI Aero GTX 1070 Ti 

ASUS ROG STRIX B450-F Motherboard (Possibly the culprit)

fsoabr,AlyricalWhyisitTaken,My keyboard and mouse both decide to stop working at the same random time and I have to turn the computer off and on again to make them work,"Unplugging and plugging them again doesn't do anything, I have to restart the computer. This started happening 2 days ago, but it would only occur 1 time a day. Today, for some unknown reason it is the third time it happened.  
I've had a similar problem to this before: after some years that I had my computer, my mouse and keyboard started turn off at a presumably random time and I had to restart the computer. There were only 2 differences: They made the disconnecting noise when they decided to turn off and there was a clear correlation between playing heavier, more demanding games. Although the  turning off was inevitable, playing those more demanding games seemed to accelerate it. I could spend hours on Terraria or watching YouTube videos before the turn off happened but could only play 20 minutes of GTA.  
I fixed this problem by buying a new set of keyboard and mouse, which seemed to fix the problem and lead me to believe that it was only a hardware problem.
About a year has passed, and the problem started occuring again 2 days ago. This time, though, there is no disconnecting sound when the turn off happens (the mouse cursor disappears but that is the only sign that it happened besides me not being able to use the keyboard and mouse) and there seems to be no correlation between how demanding the game I'm playing is, and the time the turn of happens seems more random. It used to happen less frequently though.  
I don't know what to do, please help. If this is a hardware problem I can change the flair.",0,1585698572,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsoabr/my_keyboard_and_mouse_both_decide_to_stop_working/,techsupport,1

fso38n,boilersitch,Problem with my laptop running on Linux that it's now stuck at one screen,"**Background on my laptop**

I have a Toshiba Satellite that used to run on Windows 8.1, runs on Pentium. I got it in 2015, and after using it for a year or two, it got a bit too slow, so I had been refreshed it once or twice.

Then, I had been abusing the power button for a while to turn off the laptop quickly. I did this for quite a number of time that the laptop just said scanning the disk or troubleshooting or something, I couldn't remember exactly, but it was early 2019. So I went on to the internet, and the helps I found didn't help on the problem. So I resorted to install Linux on the laptop. I installed Linux onto my USB drive to boot it with the laptop on CSM boot mode instead of UEFI. 

First I tried Lubuntu 18.04, then it got frozen, I forced shut down using the power button again, and it ran into problem when I boot the laptop again. Then I tried Ubuntu, which I used for about a year. Of course there and then, the laptop froze and I resorted to the power button to force shutdown. It ran into the similar kind of problem where the error lines appeared, but then the login part appeared and I thought it was no big problem.

**Now came what happened recently**

This happened about mid-to-late February 2020. I opened the laptop at the lecture hall at my university, then closed the laptop (not turned off) when I left. When I got back home, I turned it on and the system info lines just popped out. I resorted to force shutdown again :(. I turned it on again, then it got stuck the system just tried to fix the problem. 

I then boot a USB with Lubuntu 18.04, and installed Lubuntu 18.04 on the laptop. This time I installed Lubuntu 18.04 but a 32-bit ISO file. I have been using 64-bit ISO files for the whole time. And it was my regret. I boot the laptop, and I went through the whole hassle of installing it with the old-computer-style screen. I finished the process, but somehow it couldn't work, and too bad I can't remember how I did it. 

Then I reinstalled Lubuntu 18.04 using the 64-bit ISO file, which was easy to follow and I could use Lubuntu for a day. I then turned the laptop off properly this time. Then the next day, I turned it on, it got the similar kind of problem of trying to troubleshoot.

By this time, the boot order is USB before HDD on the BIOS page.

*When I did not plug in the USB to boot it up*

When I tried on UEFI, the system said that it couldn't find any bootable drive. But when I boot the laptop at CSM mode, it took about 6-7 minutes, maybe 10 minutes, before it got to Lubuntu. There was one time I could actually use Lubuntu with GUI, but for most of the time, it was just black screen with terminal command line, while I'm just a novice at Linux command line

*When I did plug in the USB, and it's where I am at now*

Part 1: I now tried Ubuntu and Xubuntu. I successfully managed to use the ""try without installation"" mode, both on UEFI and CSM, and I could try out both Ubuntu and Xubuntu. However, when I tried to install Ubuntu or Xubuntu, it got stuck at the select language window or connect to wifi window. I then resorted to force shut down and repeat that again and again :(( I even tried the troubleshoot and help options, none worked.

Part 2: This is where I stuck at now, and I use a different USB drive that I used more than the one I mentioned above on the above Part 1 of When I did plug in the USB. When I booted from the USB that contains Xubuntu, it just stuck at the Xubuntu loading window that supposes to appear the log in section. The loading circle just keeps loading on and on.

That's where I'm stuck now. I would appreciate if you guys can help me, thanks :))",0,1585697873,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fso38n/problem_with_my_laptop_running_on_linux_that_its/,techsupport,1

fsnkzb,drumsndrums,"Surface Pro 7 model 1866 win10 with Microsoft docking station making odd varying pitch, crapping out noises","I’m on a work machine that’s been having intermittent issues with noise since working from home. 

Setup at work is as follows:
Surface Pro 7 model 1866 
Windows 10 pro 10.10.18363
Kensington SD7000 docking station 
3 24” 1080p aux monitors 

Setup at home is the same except:
Microsoft Surface Dock 1661 (instead of Kensington)
3 total aux monitors:
1 24” 1080p aux monitor
1 27” 1080p aux monitor
1 27” 4K aux monitor
Also am on wifi as opposed to Ethernet at work. WiFi at home is (up to) 150 mbps. 

Power settings were on high performance until I switched to balanced a bit ago. Noises totally subside when I unplug from the dock (this of course kills all aux monitors).

I never noticed noise at all at work, but perhaps it was contained within the more enclosed dock? 

Since coming home the fan noise has been mostly consistent (pitch is fairly consistent with processor load), but today a new noise (didn’t sound like a fan) started. Pitch was varied, but mostly sounded like a light softsynth gradually lowering in pitch. Kind of like something was crapping out inside. 

In both docking situations, two of the aux monitors are connected via hdmi/dp plugs, and one usb B/ hdmi or vga adapter. 

I haven’t really noticed any major performance issues until recently and just want to make sure I’m not overloading the system with the setup. Should note that we have an entire office using these Kensington setups with three aux monitors without issues.

fsnib5,Riku2211,"Been having BSODs and freezes since PC upgrade; ran memtest86 a few times, got 70+ errors once","So, I upgraded my motherboard, CPU, and RAM last November and had some issues getting it started, but ended up getting it booted up and everything seemed fine. Unfortunately, after that, I continued having blue screens and freezes very randomly - they would seem to happen all at once and then be fine for up to a month. I thought I'd fixed it some time ago with a driver update, but the issues eventually came back. They seem to be most troublesome when it comes to trying to play VR games, but again, sometimes I can run a game fine for hours.

In general, most of the BSOD errors trace back to it being ""drivers or memory"", and I'm betting on memory at this point. I ran memtest86 last night without changing anything after having had multiple crashes and blue screens trying to play a VR game, and it populated over 70 errors before finishing the first pass. I stopped it early because it was late and I wanted to get more tests in, but I did take pictures of the summary. [Here's after the test](https://i.gyazo.com/7239273fb551c4bf3cb758fa5b4c54cb.jpg), and [here's the summary afterward](https://i.gyazo.com/bc330401ab6d9acfb8131b6d8fa096c9.jpg). Unfortunately I didn't take a picture of the test failure numbers summary because I thought I'd be able to save it to a log file, but then it failed to do so, so I don't have that info :(

Then I tried running more tests, one RAM stick at a time in both slots (so 4 tests). I let 1 pass finish for each and had no errors. I then tried testing with both sticks in, but reversed which one was in which slot (not that that should matter), got 1 single error in 4 passes overnight (one failure on test 4). Then I tested again with them in their original configuration, got no errors at all in 3 passes before I had to stop it to use my PC.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on here? How did I go from 70+ errors to 0? I'm worried this could be either a motherboard issue or a CPU issue instead of RAM, but I was thinking of getting the RAM replaced as soon as I can to test that first. I actually did find that my motherboard (MSI Z-390A Pro) is specifically compatible with my model of RAM, but slightly off. I have G.Skill Ripjaws V series model ""f4-3600c16d-16gvk**c**"", while my motherboard is compatible with ""f4-3600c16d-16gvk"", no 'c' at the end. As far as I can tell, the only difference between them is timing, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to know the implications of this. Could this be my issue? Is there any chance I can adjust RAM timings manually, and how would I know what to set them to?

In case it's relevant, my processor is an Intel i7-9700KF. [This](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/support/Z390-A-PRO#support-mem-3) is where I found out about my motherboard's RAM compatibility. The RAM is 2x8GB.

Basically, when I'm doing something (playing games or just typing an essay), my computer would just freeze up and then restart on its own with no warning. It's not super frequent and it occurs randomly, but it gets very concerning when it happens more than twice.

So, I thought it was an overheating issue and I tried to clean out my fan, which seemed to do the trick until it restarted AGAIN today. I checked my fan to make sure, and everything seemed clean, there was nothing hindering the fan and it was running fine.

I thought it was a malware issue so I installed Malwarebytes and ran a scan. It caught some potentially dangerous files and quarantined them. However, even after I ran another scan and it told me everything was fine, the same problem occurred again.

So, I moved onto CPU or RAM. When I try to recreate the scenario by opening the same applications, my CPU and memory are at a safe percentage, my disk isn't too overloaded either. I also tried updating my drivers and BIOS, but it says everything is up to date.

I can't seem to figure out what's wrong! :( By the way, here is information about my computer below.

 One day he tells me that it failed to boot and BIOS was corrupted, so I buy another motherboard and I did not pay attention and bought a [Dell Optiplex 7010 Desktop Motherboard LGA/1155 GY6Y8](https://www.ebay.com/itm/254331596318) thinking it would work, NOPE.

fsmxqs,stefantatic,Computer makes beep sounds while gaming,"Hello, so recently i bought a brand new pc and a problem has occurred. While playing League of Legends, my PC starts making strange beep sounds. The first 10 minutes i play on 200-100 FPS and then for about 2-3 minutes my fps rapidly drops to 40-5 FPS and the computer starts making strange beep sounds. Sometimes 1, sometimes 2 with small pause and sometimes 3. Here are my specifications:

Windows 7 OS

ASUS Motherboard

Intel Celeron Processor CPU G1840 @ 2.80ghz duo core

4.0 GB RAM

Intel HD Integrated graphics and AMD Radeon R7 200 series dedicated GPU with 2GB memory

I play League of Legends on lowest settings, I suppose that I shouldn't have any problems but this problem occurs for some reason.

The whole PC is new except for the dedicated graphics card which I took from my old PC.

If someone would explain to me what is the reason for my PC making beep sounds and my fps radically dropping from 200 fps at the start to 40-5 or even sometimes hitting 1 FPS and then goes up to 100+ FPS after 2-3 minutes of lagging. This happens every match almost and does not happen while I'm using PC for surfing, watching movies or whatever. And is there any way to solve this problem? 

I'm not playing any other games except  League of Legends, is this problem caused by League of Legends itself or? And I wan't to write of GPU causing it because it was the same when I used integrated graphics card.

fsmlxb,Roadruntt,Mystery issue - still occurring after multiple days.,"Hello, almost a week ago i started having issues with my PC, randomly while i'm playing games (WoW,Civ6 and COD BR) i will encounter a black screen, however i am still able to hear the audio. My GPU fans max out and i have to manually restart or shutdown the computer. 

This has currently occurred multiple times. Unfortunately this issue is proving to be difficult, as it doesn't seem to be possible to replicate  as sometimes i can play for hours without it occurring, and then suddenly it occurs. 

When it occurs there are no  error codes present on the MOBO and after i restart and look through the event logs there aren't any errors to suggest something had gone wrong. 

My setup includes two monitors, one 240hz (Alienware) and  a standard 60hz (benq) monitor. One is running from Displayport and the other HDMI. When it occurs both monitors go black. 

(It may be debatable on whether or not my GPU is  sufficient for 240hz, however i have had no issues for the past few months since obtaining the monitor)

&amp;#x200B;

Currently this is what is what has been attempted and failed.-

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gpu swapped out. (2060 --&gt; 1050ti) (Monitor re-fresh rate was set to 60hz)

\-Ram has been set to default (3000 --&gt; 2133)

\-BIOS has been updated

\-Drivers have been wiped and reinstalled

\-Swapped out HDMI to Display port cable for HDMI to HDMI (1050ti doesn't have 2 DP slots, 2060 has no HDMI slots) 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently Trying - 

Running each monitor separately to see if the issue occurs.

Note : I have considered resetting the PC, although i am worried that a crash may occur during the resetting process causing permanent damage.

about a month or two ago my computer begun to BSOD whilst playing certain games. I play games like Escape from Tarkov and MW which it seems to occur within 5 minutes of playing to the point at which its unplayable. Certain low graphical requirement games like League of Legends seem to not have the same issue as I cannot recall this happening whilst playing it.

- Seasonic PRIME TITANIUM 850w PSU
- Corsair CPU Water Cooler
- Acer Predator XB241YU (24"" 2K)

Below is a list of things I have attempted to help resolve the issue.

- I updated all my drivers which didn't help.
- Someone told me having my VR headset (Oculus Rift) plugged in during gameplay can cause this issue so I unplugged it, USB's and HDMI. Didn't help.
- Cleaned out my entire computer tower just in case heating was an issue but my temperature has never been close to anything above at risk levels.
- Reinstalled windows.
- I was told my processor can create a bottle neck when gaming at 2K so for all games I changed my render resolution to 1920x1080p to -try- and help circumvent this.  
- Replaced my PSU cable in case it was faulty.
- Changed the wall power socket to which my computer plugs into. 
- Ran windows memory diagnostics tool. Came back no errors.

Below is a list of the blue screen errors I have been experiencing. 

- KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE
- SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (what failed win32kfull.sys)

A month or more after that, I started getting BSODs with errors **""VIDEO\_DXGKRNL\_FATAL\_ERROR""** and **""DRIVER\_POWER\_STATE\_FAILURE.""** At this point I realized it would probably need to get checked out, but as I was a busy student, and the only consequence was having an unexpected 2 minute reboot every week or two, I kept putting it off. Now today, it is suddenly completely unusable.

I let it do its thing but when I signed into my pc the next day my Ethernet icon was gone and in its place there was a network globe symbol with a stop in the bottom left, when this symbol is there I can’t access the Internet 
Even in the short bursts the Ethernet symbol comes back I still can’t get online on most websites and the ones that do load never do fully and take forever.

I have tried everything

I’ve been on countless articles and even spoke with some tech support people directly from Microsoft but nothing any of them suggested was working.

I’ve uninstalled the latest updates as it was working fine before the update 

I have turned my pc and my router on and off more times than I can count

I have tried to identify my network multiple times

I’ve entered in the IP address manually

I’ve temporarily disabled and updated and everything else I’d been advised to do.

fslz6j,Varialle,Hide images in (or otherwise optimize) a large word document?,"TL;DR: Running windows 10, having issues with a Microsoft Word document lagging and freezing constantly.

Hi all! I'm currently working in a relatively large microsoft word document--126,000 words, lots of images--and it's running unbearably slowly. I'd appreciate any advice on how I might make it lag less so that I can scroll through it and use the spell-check without hanging every few seconds.

The document was originally a pdf that I converted to word in order to use the spell-checker (It's a draft of a non-fiction book that I'm proofreading), and I imagine the many different fonts and images and so on are slowing things down a lot. Is there anything at all I can do to speed things up without completely destroying the flow of the document? I'd like to keep the text on the right pages if possible.

I've tried selecting the ""use picture placeholders"" option in the advanced settings, but it doesn't seem to have done anything--any thoughts on how that feature works?

Hey,

I have 2x4GB DDR4 HyperX Fury 2133MHz bought in 2015, which i overclocked to 2666MHZ on 16-16-16-35 @ 1.3V.

It is literally impossible for me to find my 2133's in-stock(only available are from 200euro+, idk why). And I want/need to upgrade - this is where I have a problem, because I can not find any info about it. [as this intel site says](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/88191/intel-core-i5-6600k-processor-6m-cache-up-to-3-90-ghz.html?q=6600k) my max cpu supported ram speed is 2133MHz(?), and i am not sure if i can stick new 2666mhz(stock) RAM in my mobo and hope it works.

so,

1. is it okay if I buy 2x4GB 2666MHz and pair it with my overclocked ram(clock it to same timings, voltage etc.)?

or

2. can I buy 2x8GB 2666MHz ram and it should work with my cpu even if intel site says it is above 2133MHz(i cant understand how it is meant)?

or

3. I can only stay on 8gb ram unless i upgrade cpu?(my mobo allows up to 3600MHz)

EDIT: forgot to mention my cpu is overclocked to 4.4GHz @ 1,265V(idk if it is somehow helpful)

I usually change some configurations quickly by opening the Control Panel using a shortcut, Start+Pause. This goes straight to the Computer Properties window. From there, I press Ctrl+F to search. When I type something and press enter, it's supposed to show search results, but it goes to the initial screen instead. I have to type my search and press enter a second time for it to work, and it definitely breaks the flow.

I know some would say to search straight from the Start Menu or Cortana Search Bar. I know it's better, I just want this small thing fixed.

I remember that, in older versions, the results start to appear right after typing, no need to press Enter. This doesn't happen now.

Also, upon pressing Enter, I used to simply press Down key or Tab key to reach the results using the keyboard. This no longer works, as pressing Tab seems to focus on the first items on the window (like the undo and redo buttons).

So Ive been having numerous problems with my laptop pc that I got 2 years ago. From the day I bought my laptop I found out my battery was completely busted (my battery was draining away like crazy when I charged for the first time and the laptop was burning hot) but I’ve been so caught up with med school that I couldn’t go for a repair. Later on, many problems started coming up one by one. Whenever I plugged in my laptop for charging, it would overheat and my laptop would suddenly freeze, make weird noises and my screen would go black (surprisingly my laptop was still switched on but there was nothing on the screen, I had to force restart to fix it) and only once did I get a blue screen(Stop code: VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE, igdkmd64.sys failed). Recently I figured out lowering the screen brightness and/or putting on power saver lowered chances of such episodes from happening. Nowadays after an update, where my brightness doesn’t change anymore (another problem...smh) fixed the black screen problem. Instead nowadays, often I play a video, either keeping my laptop plugged in or not, the weird noise starts coming again and the video slows down a lot. Sometimes it resolves by itself, otherwise I have to wait for it to go away (keep my laptop muted). What’s wrong with it? Is there a way I could fix it myself from home now that there’s corona lockdown and repair shops are closed? 

(P.S: I did take it for a repair a few months ago and I noted all these issues to them, but they only:

1.  Put a new Cooling fan (made a lot of buzzing noise) (every other hardware was alright)
2. Told me battery’s condition is really bad (It didn’t fall under warranty, so I didn’t change it

My laptop seems to be running really hot with minimal workloads sometimes. It's behavior is very erratic. Sometimes I will be running FL Studio or 3D modeling software with almost no fan action, but something as simple as Chrome with a few tabs and OneNote ramps the fans into overdrive.

* Almost always hooked up to 2 external monitors via D6000 dock. Only other connected devices are condenser mic through sound card whose power supply is almost always off, and bluetooth keyboard/mouse
* Running Win10
* Not sure if related but I've been having problems with it booting up while asleep in my backpack and cranking fans to max and getting scalding hot, although I've been told this has to do with the way Win10 handles C states so might be unrelated.

[QNINE NVME CI Express 3.0 x4 to M.2 PCIe SSD Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F9RBP5W)

I know a custom BIOS is required to boot from PCIe NVME on older motherboards like mine but for now I'd just like to use it for storage in Windows until I can upgrade the rest of my system. I don't want to attempt modifying the BIOS firmware since I don't need the boot functionality on the new drive.    

I have an RTX 2080 in the top PCIe 3.0 x16 slot on the motherboard and the NVME on the second. If I understand correctly this configuration should drop both slots down to 8 lanes each.    

As the title says my issue is not seeing the drive in Windows whatsoever. Nothing new in disk management. Windows update is up to date. I don't have another system to troubleshoot the new hardware on.    

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.    

**Updates:**    

So it seems my CPU only has 16 PCIe lanes. I also have a USB 3.0 card in one of the PCIe 2.0 x1 slots. I'll try taking that out of the picture but the NVME adapter can only use 4 lanes as it is.

No love even with the graphics cards and nvme being the only pci addons in the machine.    

I'm thinking it could be a driver issue but W10 should have that natively... Guess it's hardware??",11,1585688720,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fslbcc/new_m2_nvme_in_old_z68_motherboard_asrock/,techsupport,1

fsl4f5,undercutprincess,Virtual Event Running - Please help!,"Hey all, Hopefully you can help me but please, send me to another subreddit if there's a better option!

I work for an outdoor educator in NZ, and we're running a virtual instructor function for all of our contractors to celebrate the end of the peak season. Sadly, this ended early - we are all in complete lockdown in NZ. Hence the need for a virtual function!

We are wanting to run a virtual pub quiz for our instructors, as well as show them a slideshow of collated images of peak season and generally have a catch up and make them feel more connected and valued by our permanent team.

Being a small family-owned company, things are understandably tight at the moment and we don't have the budget for a whole lot of fancy software so yes, I am looking for a cheap (free, ideally) cheerful option that will tick the boxes for us.

I need to be able to:

\- Run a 'face to face meeting' via webcams for those with bandwidth

\- Stream the 'meeting' to Facebook live in our group for those who can't cope with the webcam streaming

\- Allow for people to access us without seeing the video stream but still hear the audio.

I am flexible as all hell, so if you reckon I don't need the audio only option or the FB live option, lemme know. My colleagues reckon we need both of these - we have a handful of people living in vans streaming from mobile devices and I don't know enough to pursue a better option!

I'm not asking for someone to spend their valuable time developing anything for me, I just have no idea what to search for since my current Google search terms aren't getting me anywhere, so if you know of software that will do the job, lemme know!

Our company has access to the Microsoft suite as well.

if the black screen does come back on, it will happen over and over again every few minutes until I either, launch a game and that somehow manages to stabilize it, or it doesn't come back on.

the issues recently stopped for a while after my drivers (somehow) got uninstalled. a few games stopped wanting to launch but other than that, everything worked fine. until I was trying to figure out why Minecraft wouldn't launch and discovered I didn't have drivers installed, which is weird because on games that would launch, I couldn't tell any difference at all.

once I reinstalled drivers, the issue started again. i got the drivers off of the and website so that isn't the issue. i know the most recent drivers have some issues but I didn't think they were this bad? my card is a 4gb rx580.

I've also swapped monitors to make sure it isnt my monitors hdmi port, switched hdmi cords, and used a different hdmi out on the pc itself. There isnt much troubleshooting that I can do because, well, I cant get the pc to stay on for more than 30 seconds. I can, however, launch it in safe mode with no issues.

Hey so here's my situation. Currently, I have the Arris Surfboard SBG6700ac modem/router combo and I have Xfinity wifi. I don't pay much for the internet, only have the ""up to 75mbps"" package which typically seems plenty fast for us. It's just two of us in the house so normally there are 2 computers or a computer and streaming tv going on. Every other connection works pretty well except for my desktop computer. Recently I bought a new desktop and it just has a terrible connection. I ran an internet speed test on it and it says I get between 5-25mbps one it! I can't stream classroom Zoom meetings right now without lagging out and having an extremely difficult time with it. 

We have a 2 story condo and we're limited where we can place the router. It is downstairs on the rear wall, while my office/second bedroom is upstairs on the front wall. Our place is only about 1000sq ft so I never thought this would be an issue...

We don't really game or do anything too intense on the connection.

I'm trying to determine, should I buy a new router and modem or should I pay for a better internet connection? 

A.) I'm looking at getting the Netgear Cable Modem CM500 and the TP-Link AC2600 Smart WiFi Router. They look like they're good enough while still being pretty cheap for me.

B.) I thought about increasing my Xfinity connection to up to 100mbps.

fskx6q,IrishLaaaaaaaaad,[MSI] Monitor flashes grey/black/white lines and static bars despite no damage done to PC.,"Hello /r/TechSupport.

My laptop is MSI - GF62 8RC 15.6"" Intel® Core™ i5 GTX 1050 Gaming Laptop - 1 TB HDD

I've had this since 26th September 2018 and have had absolutely no problems with this product until today, 31st March 2020. I was playing a game and then my dinner was ready, so I saved and exited the game and put the laptop into sleep mode and closed it.

After dinner, I reopened the laptop and my sister pointed out that the screen was flashing. I thought it was just Origin open in the background during sleep mode so I closed Origin and restarted the laptop. The problem however still persisted; black, grey or white lines flashed at either the top, middle or bottom of the screen with various thickness. Static bars appeared on the screen when in use regardless of the laptop activity.

After Googling the problem, updating the drivers, running an anti-virus check and restarting the laptop, the problem still persists. I did not drop the laptop nor did any other family member. The laptop was in perfect use ever since purchase and has never been dropped or hit or damaged. The problem only occurred after setting the laptop down in sleep mode to eat dinner.

I've reached out to MSI support via their website and Twitter in hopes for some help. In the mean time, is there anything I can try to fix this problem?

EDIT: [I found this on Microsoft's support page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026160/windows-10-fix-screen-flickering), but I'm afraid I'll end up damaging my laptop by messing around with uninstalling things when I've never done this before or have enough knowledge on the topic.",0,1585687492,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fskx6q/msi_monitor_flashes_greyblackwhite_lines_and/,techsupport,1

It’s a great monitor, and for my own pc gaming desktop it works flawlessly.

I also have a 2015 MacBook Pro I use for creative purposes. Generally works flawlessly*.

However, my crappy work HP laptop creates all kinds of issues. Some are resolution/detection related where it just acts bizarrely, but the more concerning issue is a specific program I have to use for my job creates temporary image retention (the white lines that are supposed to create the illusion of depth on the tabs specifically seem to burn in).

The two PCs use the same dp2 to dp2 cord, and the Mac uses a thunderbolt 2 to DisplayPort 2 cable.

I tried switching back to my PC and I was in fact able to still see the image retention but it eventually went away. No matter what I’ve tried though, I get ZERO image retention from use on either of my personal devices.

My 2 questions are:

1) Is this potentially harming my monitor over time?

2) Is it known to be possible or typical for a specific laptop itself to create this kind of issue?

fskmt9,Zockmaster,Pixel error in some pictures/videos in certain programs,"Hi Reddit,

I am pretty desperate, because I am finding no solution to this Problem.

In  Firefox/Chrome/Steam(store and library)/Spotify(Win10 App) images get  weird looking red/green/blue Pixels in lines all over them.

Here an example: [https://imgur.com/a/b0lgK81](https://imgur.com/a/b0lgK81)

Today I found out the Error is present in YouTube Videos, too. A little in VP9 videos and a lot in AV1 videos.

A strange fact: When I use the old Edge Browser, there are no problems

* My Graphics Card was already changed (RTX 2080ti)
* I used different Monitors and cables
* Formated my disk and reinstalled windows + drivers
* My PC was at a repair shop and they couldnt find the Error

Does one of you have any idea what else I could try?

If you need any additional Information I will try to give it to you as soon as possible.

fsklk8,pokebax,SATA Data Cable Smoking/Melting," I built my PC about a year ago and only used an M.2 SSD for storage.

I've been trying to add an additional standard 1 TB HDD but every time I do the PC fans &amp; motherboard lights will turn on for a split second and then turn off. When I disconnect the SATA data cable and leave the power cable connected, the PC boots. I've tried different hard drives and different cables as well as all of the SATA ports on my motherboard.

When I tried the 5th SATA port the PC booted but the drive was not shown in Windows 10. I looked down and the SATA data port was smoking on the motherboard. Fortunately, I powered everything off and other than my SATA port being melted everything is functioning properly.

Does anyone know a possible solution to this?

fskc45,Adze95,"Mom gave me her old work laptop, loaded Windows 10 on it, and lost the product key. How do I remove the ACTIVATE WINDOWS message and enable display/personalization settings?","***Of course, I don't think I can prove that I have a legit copy of Windows 10, so if you're not allowed to help me, then I completely get it.***

Like I said in the title, my mom gave me her old work laptop because my old one broke about a year before, and she was due for an upgrade anyway. But before she gave it to me, she updated the OS from Windows 7 to 10. She brought it home and got it all set up for me, but I'm stuck with the ""Activate Windows - Go to Settings to Activate Windows"" watermark on my screen at all times, and I have no access to Display or Personalization settings.

Is there any way I can get around this? I don't have enough money to just buy another product key, and from the sounds of things, there's no hope of finding the original product key my mom lost.

I've seen people talking about editing the registry, but I don't like messing with that unless I REALLY feel like it'll be safe. I've also heard that those fixes are temporary.

I've tried turning off the ""Have the Windows Experience"" option *(or whatever)* which made it go away for a little while, although I still couldn't access Display or Personalization settings.

I really have no other options. Either I find a workaround, or I just deal with the watermark. I record my screen a lot, so I'd rather not leave the watermark just sitting there.

If there's any more info I can give you, please let me know.

Thanks

fskbez,Double-Corner,Entire Folder of Unknown Software Downloaded,"Hi!

I just made a new account to post on here, because I'm nervous and confused.

Brief background: I was downloading a game off of IGG Games (I know, I know, I'm just asking for a virus by going on there) and tried to get Jackbox from it. Past downloads for other games worked fine, with no viruses on it, but this one had a /TON/. Windows Antivirus is working really hard to get rid of it all, but I believe some are slipping through. (Obviously, we don't have enough money for a good antivirus).

The folder is called ""ILGBROWSER\_INC"" on my computer and seems to have a ton of random programs and notepads in it, and I'm not techy enough to understand any of it. I've done a full scan (lasted 15 hours) and it did remove something, and since then, another threat has been popping up every few hours. 

Apparently images aren't allowed, so:

Mostly, the removed viruses are these:

Trojan:Win32/Ashify.J!ibt

But then, there's one that couldn't be removed, called, ""Trojan:Win32/Bomitag.D!ml"".

If anyone has any suggestions, please comment them. If you guys know of any good, free antiviruses, please suggest them.

The VCModa BoomPro headphones are connected via the splitter (mic/audio) and a 3.5mm jack into my Bowers and Wilkins PX7 headphones.

Attempted Solutions:

\- Reinstalling RealTek audio drivers.

\- Restarting the system once everything is plugged in.

\- Connecting the headphones to my PC via both USB-C and Bluetooth connections.

\- Trying a different pair of headphones (I plugged them into my AKG Y50BTs and have the same issue.

I could not get unto the internet and when you work from home, that's a death sentence. The error message I got was Ethernet doesn’t have a valid IP configuration in Windows 10. I did what any tier 1 level noob would do and Googled a solution. The first time, I was able to follow simple instructions to fix it. It took a day but I figure it out. I though all was good but today, it happened again. I tried the same steps to see if it would fix it but have failed. Please help, my job isn't offering any help in providing me hardware to continue work and given the circumstances in the world, I'd hate to find myself out of a job. Any suggestions?

This is the following troubleshooting steps I took.

Unplug and plug back the ethernet cable

Used a different ethernet cable

Connected directly to Modem instead of Router

Rebooted said Router + Modem

Restarted PC, checked for Updates and try running Windows troubleshooter

There is no issue with the internet since both my iphone and macbook are connected to the wifi. I tried with the ethernet cables and it works as well.

I used CMD to flush my DNS

I'm applying to a job I really want; the company outsources its job application process to brassring. When I begin the application, I have to start by making a profile of my contact information. The problem is, there is a required dropdown box for me to input my country. This dropdown box is broken, by which I mean:

* The country box will only load through ""Boumet Island"" (alphabetically), and if I try to scroll any further than that, it jumps me straight back to Azerbaijan in an endless loop. The United States is probably hidden in the ""U"" section, which is inaccessible.
* When I try to type my country into the dropdown box, the widget can't find a match and deletes what I typed as soon as I click out of the box (including if I click submit straight away).
* There is an option for the system to import my contact information from my resume document, but when I tried that, it populates every single field correctly... except for my country, even when I wrote out my entire postal address including the country.
* There is no way for me to move on to the next section of the application without filling in my country. The ""save and continue"" button pops up an error message telling me that I need to fill in all required fields before moving on.

I've tried it in two separate browsers, same issue in both. I've tried restarting my computer, no luck. I've tried clearing my browsing data, updating my java, turning off my adblocker... nothing. And I couldn't find any information online about anyone else having a similar problem.

There doesn't seem to be any way to apply without going through this system; every listing I've found links back to the same form on brassring.

And, of course, brassring has no contact info for tech support.

fsj87j,StraightRespect,Which to choose? Asus ELMB (Extreme Low Motion Blur) at 120hz OR Adaptive Sync (FreeSync) at 144hz? Specifics inside!,"*Question*

**In-short**

Asus ELMB (Extreme Low Motion Blur) @120hz or FreeSync@144hz with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super for fast-twitch first person shooters (think more competitive, less casual)

**In-depth**

I can choose between FreeSync at 144hz (on an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super) OR ELMB (Extreme Low Motion Blur by Asus) at 120hz. Which is the superior choice for me and why? Is there a test I can do to determine this myself? Personally, I don't mind tearing, if it's up to personal choice and there's no objectively better decision to make.

Also, is there any reason to enable Vsync to any degree in this setup or should it remain turned off at all times? Should I limit the frame rate a few frames below 144hz in case of going with AdaptiveSync? Should I do the same with ELMB? Ideally, why?

For context, I play mainly FPS games (CODBO4/CODMW Multiplayer, reaction speed is insanely important, but so is the ability to clearly identify enemies, where a lack of tearing certainly helps), so minimal input lag is key. Crucially, the game should also feel consistent and not choppy (speeding up/down while I move my mouse, if that makes sense).

Depending on which choice I go with, is there something I need to be aware of? Some settings that has to be turned on or switched to make the best use of either feature?

**Data**

* Monitor - [Asus VG279Q](https://www.asus.com/us/Monitors/VG279Q/) (there are two others also connected, but I assume that makes no difference for this?)
* GPU - Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060 Super (auto. overclocked + 800MHz memory OC)
* Driver - GeForce Game Ready 445.75
* CPU - AMD Ryzen 5 2600x

fsit10,Jerson789,PC Problems (A bunch),"Heyy!

First of all I want to thank you if you even read this. The reason I decided to make this post is bc I've built my first (self-built) PC on October 2019, its a beauty and works awesome, but I've had some problems from the beginning and some new that started a couple of weeks ago.

I'm gonna explain each one in a different paragraph so it's easier for people who know to help me.

Here's a Benchmark: [https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/26059712](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/26059712)

My build is: Ryzen 7 2700x, ASUS ROG Crosshair IV Extreme, Corsair Vengeance RGB PRO 2x16GB 3200MHz, Samsung Evo Plus NVMe M.2 500GB (Windows is located here), Seagate Barrauda 4TB.

Problems:

1. My Processor has 2 issues: a) The cooler suddenly stops spinning, and it starts to overheat, i have to restart it and the fan starts again. I have already changed the settings from the Bios and it doesn't seem to totally solve it. b) I can't change the RGB lighting from the software (Cooler Master)  since when its connected to the internal USB port it does not detect the Cooler.
2. With the memories everything is fine, the only little thing is that from the Mobo i can't change the frecuencies to higher ones, it's locked into 2133MHz and mine can go up to 3200MHz. Again, I have checked the BIOS and so but i can't change it; every time I change that and try to turn it on it sends me to the American Megatrends screen and says that the RAM speed cannot be changed, I'll later add an image to the post.
3. I bought Corsair's LL120 Tripack with the Node pro. They are stuck in the default color cycle since my Mobo doesn't detect the Node Pro. I have tried talking with Corsair Support but I'm from Argentina and got the fans at US, so I can't ship 'em to get new ones.

That's it, if anyone could help me i would be really happy.

If you've come this far, thanks again for reading!

fsirdq,refnulf,HDD (SATA) failure - or is it? HELP,"So I've got a dreaded clicking sound from my 1TB WD SATA drive. It came out of the blue one day (it's less than a year old) and I didn't really know what to do, so unplugged it.  


Earlier today, I plugged it back in (well not really, it was in the casing I just stuck the power + SATA cables in) and it was working perfectly fine. No clicking whatsoever. Ran it for a couple of hours and perhaps stupidly thought it was just a silly lil glitch and decided to move ahead with it.  


A few hours later, turn on the PC, and the clicking sound is back. This time not even letting me boot up Windows (which is on a separate SSD drive). I've now unplugged the SATA drive again.  


Could someone sort of shine a light on what's going on here? In my head, I've already committed to buying a new SATA drive simply because if it's clicking it's gonna die hardcore at some point, right? So I'll get that eventually when THE PANDEMIC decides to bugger off. In the meanwhile, is there a chance it's not necessarily the HD itself that's the problem and something else is going on?

fsinq5,a-r__,Please help me. My Dell Poweredge R410 wont turn on or post.,"Hi guys, 

So I recently bought a refurbished Dell R410 server 
With 
2x X5650
16gb ddr3 
500gb 7.2k dell hdd 
Perc6/iR controller 

Which I purchased off ebay for £114 shipped.

So when I recieved the server. I plugged it in and tried to turn it on. It did not turn on, the fans didnt turn on, the lcd turned on after about 1 min. 
When I pressed the power button nothing happened. 

So I was confused why it wouldn't turn on. So I opened it to see if there was something come disconnected or something. But it was all fine. I took one of the ram sticks out to check it out. Then put it all back and replugged it in and it turned on, I got into bios and all the jet engines worked. But there was an orange light on the lcd saying ""E1210 Motherboard Battery Faliure"" 

Which I assumed was the cmos battery. So I replaced it and tried to turn it on and it didnt work. I unplugged it and held the power button to drain the capacitors (or something like that). Then left it an hour and it still didnt turn on. But the blue lcd was on. 

So I tried with just 2 ram sticks still didnt work. I removed hdd and it still didnt work. I replugged in all the cables and it Still didnt work. I resat the cpus and it still dint work. 



I dont think it's the psu becuse there is still a light in the back and the lcd works. 

I tried all combinations of ram placement. 
I replaced cmos again. 
I tried with different hdd
I reconnected every cable 
I tried new power cable, and new socket 
I literally tried everything to my knowledge and it wont fully turn on. 

But one thing I did notice is that as soon as I turn it on the lcd flashes orange for literally 1ms then turn off. 
So I presume there is some kind of error stopping it from turning on, but it wont display the error. 

So it turned on once at the start and I got into bios. Next day to now i have been troubleshooting why it isnt working 

Please can you help me, please
I thank you in advance.

fsilnb,crazycaesar,Help Me Solve My Eternal Problem: Periodic Stuttering on My RX 480,"Dear redditors, I have a problem with my trusty MSI RX480 Gaming X 8G.

Specs:

Computer Type: Custom Build Desktop

GPU: MSI RX 480 Gaming X 8G

CPU: i5-4690 4x3,50 GHz

Motherboard: GA-H97-HD3

RAM: 2x 4096MB Crucial Ballistix Sport DDR3-1600 CL9-9-9-24

PSU: 550 Watt Corsair CS

Operating System &amp; Version: Windows 10 64-bit

GPU Drivers: 20.3.1

Chipset Drivers: 10.1.1.38
&amp;nbsp;

I already found various posts describing the same issue, all with fixes which make this problem better, but never managed to completely eradicate it.
I need to preface this, by saying that I bought this card used in 2017 to replace a 280X.
Shortly after getting the card I noticed very short, periodic freezes in some of the games I played (e.g. Rainbow Six Siege). They occurred like clockwork, roughly every 1 second, lasting only a very short moment, but they were there. An important detail is, that changing game settings e.g. the Resolution to something ridiculous like 640x480, doesn’t improve the stuttering at all. So first, I tried disabling Windows 10 FastBoot and also disabling every Power-Saving measure I found. Upon rebooting, the Problem often was gone for a while and only when I concentrated on spotting those freezes, I noticed them again after some time. This didn’t completely destroy my gaming experience, it was only a reoccurring annoyance.
&amp;nbsp;

Fast forward to 2020, I decided I want to upgrade my PC and get a 3600/3700X CPU. Because of the expenses connected with this I’d really like to keep the RX 480 for at least a year. Because of that, I started to investigate the stuttering issue a little bit closer. Many posts described this issue, with no definitive solution to be found, [this redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMDHelp/comments/a67v00/rx_480_msi_gaming_x_8gb_really_unstable_on_recent/) describes it pretty fitting. 

I installed the latest Drivers (20.3.1), fired up Unigine Heaven 4.0 and started tweaking values in MSI Afterburner. Often times people recommend increasing the power limit to +50, in my case this makes absolutely no impact on the periodic freezes. When observing the core clock during the benchmark, the problem shows itself as an oscillating core clock, power draw and core voltage. The first few seconds of the Benchmark it runs with a stable frequency (1303 MHz) and then the oscillations, coupled with the periodic stutters, begin.

I found out, that one can influence the severity of these stutters. By increasing the core voltage and the core clock, the oscillations then become larger and the periodic drops in frame rate more pronounced. Similarly, by undervolting and reducing the clock speed, the stutters become less pronounced.
In the following Images you can see several graphs from MSI Afterburner.

[The first one](https://i.imgur.com/Qngkl9X.jpg) is showing the first few seconds of stable clock speed with no oscillations.

[In the second one](https://i.imgur.com/N76vawr.jpg), slight oscillations begin.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/7pCtobf.jpg) you can see the core voltage starting to oscillate.

[This](https://i.imgur.com/5n3wE9F.png) was taken around the one-minute mark of the benchmark.

[This graph](https://i.imgur.com/qXr4Ltc.png) shows what a 30 mV increase (starting from the white line) of core voltage does.

[This graph](https://i.imgur.com/bQ6qXS1.png) shows an increase of Clock Speed to 1344 MHz and +54 mV of core voltage.

[Here is a video](https://i.imgur.com/9UpTr1e.mp4) of a very severe case, notice the framerate on the upper right side

Other things I tried:

I disabled all additional Radeon features like Radeon Chill.

A BIOS update didn’t make any difference.

I tested the system latency, it is at acceptable levels.

The CPU doesn’t seem to bottleneck the GPU.

Used DDU to perform a clean driver install.

At this point I don’t have much hope left for solving this problem. The only partial solution seems to be undervolting and underclocking the card, at which point the freezes aren’t noticeable, but also incurring a considerable performance hit.

My last Idea would be to reapply thermal paste to the chip, although the readings of sub 71 °C aren’t high, maybe it would change something. I only see this as a last resort, because I have never reapplied thermal paste onto a GPU.

I’d be very thankful for any helpful tips or ideas on what I should try out.",5,1585680249,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsilnb/help_me_solve_my_eternal_problem_periodic/,techsupport,1

fsigk9,PaulRonin,Having some strange RAM issues,So I just upgraded my video card and now Windows isn't recognizing the RAM that I have installed in the 4th slot.  I'm running a  Gigabyte ga-X79-UP4 motherboard with 4 sticks of Corsair 1866 DDR3 in quad channel.  When I go into the bios it's recognized.  All 4 sticks are there.  When I boot up Windows it only sees 12gb and when I fire up CPU-Z it sees 16gb running in triple channel.  It was working fine previously (16gb in quad channel recognized everywhere).  I just recently ran Memtest86 on this motherboard with this RAM and it worked perfectly.  The only thing that's changed was that I upgraded the video card to a 980ti.  Now I'm having these issues.  I have moved the RAM around.  I have identified the fourth slot as the one that Windows isn't recognizing.  Any suggestions on what I could try to get it working again?,0,1585679802,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsigk9/having_some_strange_ram_issues/,techsupport,1

So a very, very novice bet would be RAM, hard discs or faulty OS, but before I order new components or start  formatting, I'd love some more expert opinions than my own.I've tried moving games from my HDD to my SDD with no change. My temps seem fine as well.My memory seems to cap at around 67% and doesn't change, no matter what load or game I boot. It also only shows 12 gigs of ram, despite me having 4x4GB.

It’s pretty old, and the big speakers have blown out from power surges and how to be repaired in the past, but the console itself has never been the problem. Then, this morning, mid gameplay just stopped working. My first idea was to try and use the remote, but when I pressed the power button, it said no signal. There was no light on the front of it (yellow means it’s off, green means it’s on). I checked to make sure everything was plugged in, and it was. I unplugged my power strip for 30 seconds, I unplugged the console itself and I’ve looked for help on the Bose support page, but there is nothing that describes or even comes close to my problem. Being completely honest, I’m not really good with kind of stuff. I know how to hook up console with hdmi’s and stuff, but that’s about it. I tried basic troubleshooting, and nothing is working. So if anyone has any advice or thinks they know what’s wrong, please tell me. I know if I don’t get it fixed I’ll get immediately blamed for it, but I honestly don’t know what wrong with it. Another thing, everything is connected to this Bose in one way or another and I can’t access any of the things like the blu ray or my Xbox without being able to go to the correct source. I have not messed with the things plugged into the console. Any help or at least some clarity on why it won’t work would be very appreciated.

 When we tried to use our EMR's software, i'd see the following problems (again, think 70 year olds)  
1) General discomfort with tech/downloading apps- we can manage this over the phone with patience, but trying to convert hundreds-thousands of patients this way takes quite a long time  
2) They can't see well enough on their phone to actually tell if they're inside the text box  
3) They tend to have tremors that make typing in information quite difficult.   


It's not a problem when they're here to set up for them, but not being physically present is the point.   
Are there any options you guys can think of that are as easy as Facetime (when already installed). If I could wave a magic wand to have imaginary tech exist, it would be something like:   
1) We call phone number, they pick up, it installs automatically and converts to something with Video.  
2) They call a phone number, and it installs the information automatically. 

In more direct terms, what are solutions to installing a program on someone's phone where the only things they can reliably do on their own is answer phone and dial phone numbers.",2,1585677513,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fshpuu/covid_clinic_setting_up_telemedicine_need_ideas/,techsupport,0
fshpjr,Beitzim,Can't Connect to Wi-Fi Due to Invalid IP and DHCP Problem,"EDIT: SOLVED.  It was a Firewall issue.  


Hi all,

This is my first post here on r/techsupport, so I apologize in advance if any important information is missing.

Recently lost the ability to connect to Wi-Fi on one of my home computers (Win 10,  connects via tp-link tl-wn822n).  It doesn't seem to be a problem with the Wi-Fi or router itself, as other devices are able to connect just fine, and trying to connect the PC to the internet via mobile hotspot yielded the same problem.  All Wi-Fi networks appear as available, but as soon as I connect to one it says that the internet is unavaiable.

After spending some time looking up the issue online, I've found and tried several potential soluions, to no avail.  It is, however, worth noting that the commands ""ipconfig /renew"", ""ipconfig /release"", ""netsh int ip stop"", ""netsh int ip start"" have all failed when trying to run them on Admin cmd.

Here's a copy of my ipconfig -all output, any and all help will be greatly appreciated!

Hello,

My PS3, slim model, bought used so don't know the exact year, but I've had it for 6, just kinda stopped loading games out of a sudden.  
It stays in the living room, it's never too hot, I placed it on little legs for it to breathe, and I clean it about once a month.  
Sometimes the game doesn't load at all when I put in the disk so I can't even open it, and other times the disk appears and the game opens but when I make a load happen, like going into a stage or quick-traveling, it just stays there loading forever, it doesn't freeze, or crash it just...never finishes loading.  
Does anyone know if that is fixable, and if so, how?

Thanks in advance.

MSI GTX 970","Transported my tower from my house to my partner's house when lockdown was announced, on arrival I plugged it in to her monitor and booted up Rocket League. Got like 5 FPS. Tragic.

Prior to the journey, it was absolutely fine, got it second hand off a mate and have been using it about 3 months, no problems and was running on a 3 monitor setup, can't remember the exact stats but I was running RL on max settings, and was able to play Warhammer Total War 2 on max as well with decent performance. I basically on a train the entire time, computer didn't have much opportunity to get knocked about. Could it potentially be an impact of static from the train carpet or something? Could it possibly just affect the gfx card? Everything else seems fine.

The card still lights up when I boot, fan is spinning, checked all the connections and everything seems fine. Should I reseat it?

Is it possible that it's just because of the old monitor I'm now using? Really hoping that's the case because the only other alternative is that it's borked. I'm running a VGA cable straight into the motherboard (MSI Z97 PC Mate), whereas before I had main monitor DVI, secondary monitor HDMI (both to GFX card), tertiary monitor VGA (to motherboard).

fsg48o,LurkingArmidilo,144 hz monitor not displaying 144 hz as an option after graphics card change,"Hey there, hope somebody can help me with this.

So, I've got a Asus VG248QE monitor as my main monitor, and on my previous graphics card, a GTX 1080, I was using a DVI cable, which worked fine and I was able to use 144hz, no problem.

Last night I installed my new graphics card, a 2080 Super, got it bolted in and secured, and since it only has 1 HDMI port and I had no DisplayPort cables, I used my HDMI cable which I normally use for my second monitor and I plugged it up to the VG248, which worked fine, however it was locked at 60 hz, due to the cable, I believe.

The next day, today, I went out and bought a DisplayPort cable from a nearby shop (since the 2080 Super doesn't have a DVI port for me to use my cord that the VG248 came with) and plugged it into my 2080 Super and my VG248. However, I'm still only able to select 60 hz, 59hz, and 50hz.

So, what I've tried : restarting the computer (obviously), fully shutting down the computer and booting back up, and reinstalling my VG248 drivers, and ensuring my graphics card drivers are up to date.

What's interesting to me is that under ""Adjust desktop size and position"" (this is in NVIDIA Control Panel), in the Scaling section of the panel, my Refresh Rate is listed as 144hz. But that option isn't showing up under ""Change Resolution"", just 60hz, 59hz, and 50hz.

So, am I missing something? What could be causing this?

EDIT : Perhaps I should clarify, I downloaded the ASUS Multiframe software, which was the only thing listed on Asus' website when I searched my monitor's drivers. When I try to use my VG248's disk driver install, I receive an error ""NVIDIA Installer cannot continue : this graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware"" though my initial thought with this error was that it is simply an old driver disc.

fsg1qm,HGMIV926,Am I able to safely play games above my current hardware?,"In 2015 I built a machine that included an FX-8350 and some other competent parts. Over the years I've upgraded my RAM(16 GB DDR3) and GPU(RX480) so my setup has served me just fine. But now with games coming out like Doom Eternal and M&amp;B II requiring a Ryzen 3 at minimum, I see my Ol' Faithful 8350 aging quicker than ever.  

I was able to play the M&amp;BII beta just fine, although I know that is probably very different performance-wise than the recent Early Access release.  

With games that require a Ryzen 3 or 5, at least for the time being, if I lower the settings overall, or the most CPU-intensive settings, could I safely play games like this?

fsfxmk,SeedIsTrash,Question About an Email Incident,"Hello!

Somewhat curious and also interested in learning about something in regards to an email address. Recently, for a game I play, an email associated with it was sent, I presume, a phishing link for a password reset. It was not triggered by me, so without a doubt screams a phishing attempt (phishing attempts are rather high in this game), or it could mean someone got a hold of my main email associated with it and it is legit password reset. Regardless, I am more so curious how someone even knew that my email had any association with the game I play? I've checked if both emails used were breached, and the one, email A (the one sent the password reset), has one, while email B, has 3. All of them are old/somewhat new breaches but information and passwords are different from the ones used on those websites and everything has been changed quite recently as well, so that is the least of my concerns. My question is, how would someone even know that the email I use is associated with a game I play? And for email A, it was only ever used for one other thing, which was consequently breached awhile back, but still would have no connection to the game I play.  How would someone even possibly figure out it is associated with a game I play and send a very likely phishing email?",5,1585671830,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsfxmk/question_about_an_email_incident/,techsupport,1

Also connecting them though USB also seems to disconnect, sometimes after a few seconds, sometimes after a few minutes. When these disconnections happen the PC still thinks the controllers are there, they still show up in the Xbox Controller app and in Devices, they also will lock to whatever input was being used at the time they disconnect.

fsfka6,TBP-breaKii,Diffrent BSODs still happening a week after game froze.,"  

So first of all, these are my pc components:

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600

RAM: Crucial Ballistix 2x8GB 3000Mhz CAS-16

GPU : Gigabyte RX 580 GAMING 8GB

Motherboard : MSI B450 Tomahawk (non-max)

Storage: Kingston A400 480gb 

PSU: be quiet system power 9 500w

OS: windows 10 64-bit

I also run a wifi adapter in a usb slot.

Now here is my (pretty complex) issue(s). 

One year ago, I’ve build this pc, and its been great ever since, until last week. In the middle of a game of warzone, my pc completely froze, and I had to perform a hard shutdown. After that, I restarted the game, and the same thing kept happening. A day later, I crashed again, but now I got a BSOD saying DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL. 

I thought this could be OS or driver related, so I updated those. I went from radeon version 20.2.2 to version 20.3.1. That seemed to work fine for about two days. Then I got a different BSOD saying KERNEL\_SECURITY\_CHECK\_FAILURE. So I thought it maybe could relate to memory or the wifi adapter? I tried running the windows memory diagnostic tool, used cmd test, and unchecked marker in advanced boot options. But a day later I got the same BSOD. After that I got another BSOD, which stated the following: KMODE\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED. And today I got another one saying SYSTEM\_THREAD\_EXCEPTION\_NOT\_HANDLED. During this process I also reinstalled the game twice.

I have no idea what to do with all of these BSODs. Is there anyone who could help me out?

One other really weird thing what happened was that at during the week, task manager showed the wrong speed (1200 instead of 1500), but it also said that 8gb of my 16gb was reserved. I checked CPU-Z, and it recognized 16GB ram, and both sticks, but also shows 2400Mhz. So I went into the bios, and there was this really weird thing where it showed that the DDR speed was 2400Mhz, but if I went into the overclocking settings, it showed that the memory was running at 3000Mhz. How is this even possible?

I have tried turning the mic volume all the way up as well as maximizing the booster. It is all already full. Furthermore, any headset I connect (Bluetooth or aux) does not receive any louder audio. My PC uses Realtek audio drivers and I have updated Windows 10 to the latest version and have updated all BIOS and Sound Drivers. Beyond that, I'm pretty confused and not at all a tech wizard.

fseoje,IZZYEPIC,Micro stutter on start up.,"Ok I've had this issue for a while now and it does my head in. 
when I turn my computer on i get this micro stutter that effects everything, even before getting into windows i can see the stutter happen on the loading circle where you're giving the option to enter the bios. Also the computer generally boots up slower when this micro stutter happens.

so far i've replace the gpu, psu and ram since this issue has appeared and the problem remains. 
only remaining parts since the issue appeared is the mobo, cpu and the ssd which my computer boots off of. 

Windows 10 pro
mobo- asus  maximus ix formula 
   cpu- is i7-7700K CPU 
   ssd- samsung SSD 849 PRO series. 
  GPU- ROG Strix RTX 2080 ti
  RAM- Vegeance rgb 16 gb 3000mhz  (This ram is temporary as my other ram been sent back with a fault, happens with both ram)

Things to know is that the ssd is pretty old, was from a build when i originally bought my computer about 6 or 7 years old, back when 780 ti's were the top dog.. i suspect this is the culprit.  

I've noticed that the micro stutter goes away if i let my computer stay on for a while. not entirely confirmed but i have booted the computer up and gone to work knowing the issue was there when i left it and was gone when i came back.

It doesn't matter how many time you turn the computer off and on, the micro stutter doesn't go away unless i take the ram out and back in before booting up, also done this with my GPU but works more often with the ram. 

Even then I've had the micro stutter remain even after doing this. eventually it works, but never works when simply booting it up and down. 

The micro stutter always comes back though the moment i shutdown my computer and turn it back on. because of this I often leave my computer on as long as possible before shutting it down again and restart the process again. 

Lastly I've noticed i can stall the micro stutter problem by putting my computer to sleep instead of shutting it down. It doesn't appear when i wake the computer up.",0,1585667757,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fseoje/micro_stutter_on_start_up/,techsupport,1
fseo7x,Rakata86,PC crashes on high frame rates.,"Hello Tech Support! 

I have a strange issue with my PC, and was hoping that maybe the bright minds of Reddit could give me some pointers or help out.

So my issue is that, when i play games, and they are not FPS capped, they will eventually crash (full on reboot, kernel error). 

Setup : 
OS : Windows 10
CPU : AMD Ryzen 5 3600
GPU : RTX 5700
MoBo : ROG strix b450-f Gaming
PSU : Corsair RM850W

Other info :
Acer XFH240H display

Now, i have tried to diagnose the issue to narrow down potential problems, but i cant seem to pinpoint anything except the FPS itself.

1. temperatures don't cause the crash - messing around with fan speeds, undervolting and underclocking/overclocking - doesn't matter if the GPU is chilling at 45degrees or sweating at 85 degrees - no crashes, but set the boy loose and dont cap FPS = crash, at any temperature. (eventually).

2. Tried various settings on/off, like Vsync, FreeSync, Radeon Chill etc. It seems the only thing that for sure reduces/stops crashes is setting my monitor to 60hz and turn Vsync on in all games. (again, in those games i can put everything on max, run the the GPU into 80+ degrees, run it for hours = no crashes, as long as i keep it at 60fps). 

3. tried re-seating the GPU (made sure PCIX settings is Gen 3 - tho Gen 4 is disabled in latest BIOS update anyway).

4. yes, everything is up to date (bios, drivers, ddu'ed it and all that). 

5. It seems some games + AMD drivers *sometimes* has issues figuring out the refresh rate / vsync. Like currently in Doom Eternal, sometimes it will cap at 60, sometimes it will cap at 144 (my native refresh rate) - irregardless of the system refresh rate setting. 

6. In addition it seems dual monitors, 144hz monitors and anything DP related is causing irregularities in the settings/results i see in game, but its hard to pinpoint.

Anyways, my own best bet is that the GPU is simply just slowly dying somehow, but i dunno, maybe some of you have had similar issues or solved something vaguely related before.

fsemf9,AbsoluteUnitChungus,Laptop SSD upgrade. NEED HELP!,"I recently bought an M.2 NVMe SSD to replace my factory ssd. When I purchased my ssd from memory express they never made mention of the external drive ssd reader thing that every YouTube video and article seems to refer to using as well as never mentioning the need to “put the OS on the new ssd”. 

I’m not very tech savvy and have no idea what any of this refers too. I already have a 2 TB external hard drive and already have all important files backed on to that. My thought was I can simply just take the old ssd out and put in this new one as everything important is in the external, then empty out the external hard drive back into my computer with the new ssd.

My laptop only has one storage solution which is the one m.2 nvme ssd connector, so wouldn’t the computer just automatically “store” the OS on the single drive it has (which is the new ssd I bought)? Where else would the “OS go” if it’s not going to go on the new ssd, the processor? The ram stick? The cloud? 

Because of the pandemic I don’t want to go back to memory express again to purchase that connector so Im hoping I can just get away with plugging and playing. I literally have nothing else important on the SSD besides games (but I’m assuming I can just delete them and re download them from steam). I also want to give the old ssd to another person.

fse0qb,acuppajoseph,Using NoMachine Remote Desktop without Firewall,"In light of the work-from-home boom that has hit us all, our company's tech support team has elected to use NoMachine Remote Desktop after a debate between that and Chrome Remote Desktop. I'm already aware of the features that each pose, however, it's unclear to me what the security differences are between the two. Could that be explained or is there a list out there that rates the security features of each? I've had no luck finding it on my own.

The reason I'm mostly concerned about that alone is that NoMachine seems to only work on our work machines if their local firewalls are turned off, which I feel like is particularly unsafe for a work computer. I can't verify that this is the ONLY way it works, but our IT team keeps experiencing difficulties with intermittent connections that sometimes work and sometimes won't when the firewall is turned on on a particular machine. To clarify, this wasn't an issue we had with Chrome Remote Desktop, and the firewall could stay operational and the software would still function as long as the PC never went to sleep.

Sometimes running the troubleshooter will fix this, sometimes it doesn't. Most of the solutions I've tried will fix it for a while (a few minutes to a few hours) but the problem always comes back. I've tried the following;

-Restarting the router (BT home hub)

-Factory resetting the router 

-Releasing and renewing IP address

-Resetting TCP/IP

-Deleting and updating adapter driver 

-Manually setting IP address

-Disabling IPv6

-Flushing DNS

I own an HP Probook 4530s, currently 9byears old. Around 3-5 years back it, developed heating issues. 

Upon being taken to the computer repair guy, the guy shook the pc, only for black crumbs to fall out through the vent grills



. The fans are constantly blowing at max , as I've set them that way, as it heats up pretty bad.


The battery can't hold a charge for longer than 15 minutes, so it's constantly connected to the wall.



Anyway, I suspect the fan has been blocked. I was planning on pulling the lappy apart and cleaning it out.



As of now, the only tools I have ( can't purchase anything else) are a box of disposable latex gloves, and a screwdriver kit.

I purchased gloves as I have cuts all over hand. I'm kinda scared to let the chemicals and dust from the potentially clogged fan head into my bloodstream 


How would I go about cleaning it? On top of that, I have fears that HP may have used lead-based solders in the pc. I'm kinda scared to open it up.


I mean, if it's been running this hot for so many years ( I rarely shut it down , just send it to sleep only been doing this since last year, used to shut it down before ), some of the solder or whatever could've melted and fallen on the components.



So with that being said, is it safe to open it up with gloves and scrape out the dust with my fingers?

All started 7 months ago, my laptop, an acer swift 1, shut down randomly. At first i thought it was weird, but i soon realized something was not  ok. When i turned the laptop on again the battery level was at 22%. When the battery reach 21% it just shut down, no notice, just like when you detach the power cord from a tower pc.
The laptop has an integrated battery, it's pretty new, 1 year and an half, and it has dual boot windows 10 and linux mint, and the problem appears in both os at 21%. 
I've tried everything, from running battery test on windows (it was ok) to resetting the battery from acer website description.
The laptop has always been buzzing near the power port, both durnig discharge and charging, so i just thought the last battery cell died, so i surrendered and i sent it to warranty service.

The laptop came back and it was  working, but the strange thing was that the employee told me (i was in an hurry so i was stupid enough to ask what the problem actually was) that they didn't change any hardware components, and he vaguely replied that the problem was just solved with a bios upgrade via flashing and a clean windows install. 

I was skeptical but the problem seemed gone. I eventually reinstalled linux with grub dual boot. 
The laptop actually worked well until yesterday, when, guess what? It turneditself off at 21%.

Fortunately the pc is still in warranty, but i have to uninstall linux and hide the boot modification in order to have the warranty back, plus i need it, plus coronavirus quarantune in Italy.

I'm going to do something I've never done before and I can't find clear infos about it. I defer to your wisdom.

My boss fired a person. For reasons unknown to me this person will be allowed to retain their laptop for personal use. 

This laptop's SSD - single partition containing both data and OS - is encrypted with bitlocker. I encrypted it myself and  have the encryption key, if this is relevant. 

I need to reinstall Windows 10 Pro on this laptop to give it away. I don't want the data currently on the SSD to be recoverable, of course: they must go. Before we implemented bitlocker on all our machines I simply wrote a series of 0s on the disk before reinstalling, but this is really time consuming and not feasible in this instance. Furthermore, this is the first time I need to reinstall a bitlocker-enabled device.

I was thinking of simply booting up the installation media, deleting the current partition and reinstalling the OS. 

* Are you aware of anything that could impede this process? 
* Is this a sound strategy? 
* I think the data will be reasonably unrecoverable: am I right? 
* If the user chooses to activate bitlocker again the key will be different, I surmise: is this correct?

I ended up just booting into the live USB blind and I ran the installer. Once I rebooted however, the monitor was blank, I'm pretty sure the problem is that SecureBoot is enabled as I have had this problem installing Linux before.

I can still boot into the live USB but nothing else. Is there anyway I could display the BIOS menu on the external monitor to fix this, or even a way to disable secure boot blindly?

fscvug,Skandi007,"My PC keeps crashing during gaming, this is getting seriously annoying.","(crossposting from r/pcmasterrace, sorry. I found no solutions there.)

Something odd that has recently started occurring, is that my entire pc freezes and crashes (with audio looping) when playing games. I don't get BSOD, I can't access CTRL+ALT+DEL, I just need to manually press the power button and restart.

Now, my system is quite new, and beefy. I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600 (watercooled, temps never go above 50), RTX 2070 Super (temps never go above ~65), 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and the system is running off an NVMe M.2 SSD. Clearly, lack of performance, or heat problems, shouldn't be the cause.

At first this issue started occurring with Borderlands 3. Alright, I thought, maybe the game really is that demanding and unoptimized, that my PC simply cannot handle it. Then it happened once during a Divinity: OS2 session. Okay, that's odd. Finally it occurred once when playing Siege, and today when I tried playing PUBG. (Couldn't even get one match done). It doesn't happen during regular PC usage, or, weirdly enough, when I play For Honor. Only on other games, the number of which is rapidly growing.

I have tried every trick in the book, looked across forums and reddit threads, and found no working solution. I have completely cleaned my PC and all of its fans to check for potential cooling issues, reinstalled my Corsair Hydro H80i V2. Ran MemTest86 for hours without any issues, used DDU, installed new drivers for virtually everything, even my BIOS.

Issue still occurs. Please help me find a solution. I'm currently sitting at home in quarantine and I'm probably going to die of boredom without video games.

Thanks in advance.

Are they all going to run at full speed or will they be any limitations due to the lack of PCIe lanes?

fsc542,Mariopetar,PC deadlocks when playing games,"Hey there,

as the title suggests, PC deadlocks when playing games. It's been a reoccurring issue but I've just been ignoring it for a while but since quarantine set in, it's been really annoying having to reset my PC so often.

Basically, there is no specific scenario when this happens. Whether I'm playing Terraria or newly released Bannerlord, freezes nonetheless.  

Sorta what managed to somewhat fix it (and I really thought I managed to deal with it) was setting my graphics card power settings to max performance. Then it froze for a couple of times while playing games but as soon as I move my mouse, it came back to life. But I got a new game yesterday (Bannerlord) and when I play it, the problem is back up again. Really not sure what to do...

Things I tried:

1) Clean reinstallation of drivers for the graphics card (in safe mode)  
2) A memory check (nothing came out of it)  
3)  System file checker - nothing

The environment itself is 40 broken snapshotted VM's that new hires have to repair. They write a report on how they repaired each one. We use AHK to handle auto-launching the VM's through a custom UI that includes a description of the module and hints. Once the module is repaired they close it and can relaunch right back into the broken state using the UI or move on to the next module. It's all pretty old and no one I work with knows the AHK language that the interface was written in. Maintaining all of this has gotten to be a big headache over the years.

I've got a gigabyte ga-z97x-sli with i5 4690k.
I loaded an old saved profile in the bios out of curiosity and the computer doesn't boot.
The fans fire up for a couple seconds then it goes off, turns back on and then off. Sometimes it stays on for longer and the monitor says DVI input but the pc turns off before anything comes on the screen.

Things I've tried,
Removed gpu, reseated cpu, removed ram, hdds everything.
Removed battery, reset cmos.

I'm pretty sure either the mobo or the cpu is dead but going by the fact loading a profile killed it could it be a corrupted bios? I doubt the settings in a saved profile would be enough to kill a cpu on boot? 

I have removed the whole system from the case as I'm getting a new mobo/cpu this week anyway (pure coincidence) but I was hoping to use most of the failed system to build another pc so not knowing which part has failed is driving me mad. 

Is there any way to know if its the cpu or mobo? I don't have a mobo speaker but if I did would it tell me what part it is? 

My bios has a backup bios but that hasn't kicked in, when I thought it should if the bios failed? Apparently you can force it by shorting the main bios. I think that's my last attempt.

My monitor ([Acer P238HL](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/877284-REG/Acer_um_vp8aa_002_Acer_P238HL_BD.html/overview)) suddenly developed an issue.

Any ideas what this might be, and/or how to troubleshoot?

**More Info**

* I tried reseating the power cable, and replacing the power cable, but same issue.
* I cannot access the monitor's on-screen display.  The buttons on the unit used to bring up the on-screen display, but now they are unresponsive.
* The monitor is at least 5 years old now.  I purchased it second hand.  No issues until now.
* A repair guy in my area says it *could* the 'power supply,' in which case he might be able to repair it.  Thoughts on that?  That repair, if necessary, would cost ~$25.  So I might take it to him for a ~$15 diagnostic.  Can't hurt I guess, especially considering I don't have the tools or expertise to do this properly.

I tried to run some commands there and change to other partition (from non-existing ubuntu partition to windows partition) and all it said was unknown filesystem. 
Then I tried to use windows repair tool from usb but nothing happened after i plugged it so I wanted to change to boot from usb in bios but there was a password which I'm pretty sure I didn't set (but I remember getting into bios before). I tried to use some passwords that I could set for it but none of them worked, there was no hash code after typing wrong password for 3rd time either. Then I removed CMOS battery for 30minutes then 1hour then 1day and then 1week but it didnt remove the password. There is no jumpers so I can't remove the password like that. I think the only way to remove bios password is by replacing bios chip, but is there a way to somehow install ubuntu again so I can boot into Windows/Ubuntu?

fs9jrv,TsingShiTao,PSU clicking and now won't turn on,"A while ago (several months) my psu (HX1000i) would make a loud pop when I switched on the mains power. This happened a few times before I realised switching on the psu switch after the mains switch seemed to solve this problem.

Fast forward a few months. During the last few weeks, when I switched on my psu it would take a few seconds before 'powering up' (at this point it would click and the lights on the motherboard would turn on. Note I'm not talking about powering on my pc here). I also noticed that after I switched off my pc the psu was making a click every few seconds. 

Now this problem has been getting worse day by day (psu taking longer to power up) until today I have switched on my psu and it won't power up at all and hence I cannot use my pc.

Any help would be much appreciated. I believe I may simply have to RMA the psu as I think it's likely an internal issue but fixing the problem if possible would of course be preferable.",0,1585645039,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs9jrv/psu_clicking_and_now_wont_turn_on/,techsupport,1

fs9acu,GootPoot,[Window 10] Bluetooth adapter not working out of the blue.,"I recently purchased an Insignia Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter, which treated me well for about 2 weeks. However suddenly, I was hit with a driver error and it refused to let devices connect. Things could still be discovered, but they'd never pair. So, I uninstalled the drivers, restarted my computer, reinstalled the drivers, restarted my computer, and nothing. So I uninstalled all of my bluetooth drivers, reinstalled the Intel Bluetooth drivers, then installed the adapters drivers, and still got a driver error. From that point forward, whenever I'd restart my computer, the driver error would swap. It would say that the adapters drivers failed to start, then the next time I boot, it would say that the intel drivers failed to start. I thought that maybe the drivers on the device went out of date or something, so I decided to go to insignia support to find a driver download list. However, Insignia apparently doesn't care enough to put drivers for download, so I'm stuck there. I rolled back the Intel drivers and that didn't fix anything. So I'm stuck on what to do. Both versions of the Intel drivers failed to work, and uninstalling the intel bluetooth drivers causes them to automatically be installed with an older version whenever I next boot up my computer if I didn't install a newer version first. I made sure windows was up to date, which it was. I don't think this started happening right after a windows update, but I can't be sure because I forget.

At this hour, I've run into a weird problem that I can't understand. :(
My PC is relatively new, I purchased a new mobo, Ryzen 3500 and 8gigs of RAM along with a WD hard drive back in January. I upgraded my GPU earlier in Nov 2018.


My current system is as follows:
CPU: Ryzen 5 3500
Mobo: MSI B450M Pro M2 Max
GPU: Gigabyte GTX 1060 3GB
RAM: Adata DDR4 2666MHz
OS: Windows 10 Pro 1909


All seemed well for two months, suddenly a few days back, I started getting BSODs while downloading large files. If I play games, (mostly FH4) then I can play for more than 1 hour without interruptions at a smooth 60fps.


Now, the BSOD appears randomly. While installing, while copying, sometimes when playing Youtube videos.



Stopcodes:
KERNEL_AUTO_BOOST_INVALID_LOCK_RELEASE
MEMORY_MANAGEMENT
KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
Fltmgr.sys failed

Ive tried getting into the bios and the only way i could get in is through the advanced options in the recovery section of windows settings. I tried changing the boot order and my only options were master bot record, ip6, ip4.

I tried booting from the usb from the advance recovery settings and the usb isnt listed. I got back to bios and created a boot option from different files on the usb. Nothing worked.

Somehow now the usb is showing up in recovery. I get the windows logo and spinning dots like if i figured it out and i get a BSOD with memory management error. I do a memory check/scan and its fine.

Finally i try changing the bios to legacy from uefi disabling secure boot and yay, i get boot order options. I set the usb and it boots but now i cant install because the drives are gpt and not mbr. Id rather have gpt so i cancel the install.

I try to restart to take a break and try tomorrow and now nothing boots but the usb win10 or the recovery disk i created. Currently doing the recovery disk just to get something back to something hopefully but im sure its installing to the hdd instead of the ssd.

Not sure if this is important, but worth mentioning, the mute/unmute toggle is flipped on my mic. It's a production issue, when it's on mute it's unmuted and vice versa. They offered to replace it, but I doubt it's related as the mic works fine when plugged into my phone.

So as the title says, I am having weird lag spikes with my PC. And by lag spikes, I don't mean from a poor internet connection. This is from my system itself. I don't know if this is a recent occurrence but I started to notice it when playing Mad Max. I have my FPS counter on in most games and when this lag spike occurs, my FPS drops to as low as 40FPS and goes back up to 60FPS. It happens for about a second or so. It also seems to happen to me when  I'm on desktop too (browsing Facebook or YouTube) however it's rarely common compared to gaming.  


I've done my basic troubleshooting such as checking for driver updates, doing Windows Update, uninstalling and reinstalling my graphics driver, doing a System File Checker and all of these have not worked.

I am helping my friend fix their internet issues at the moment. Basically she can't get internet access on her iPhone and Macbook after connecting to her WiFi. I directed her to spoof her MAC address on her Macbook and suddenly her internet started working after joining back to the network.  


Note: By not getting internet I mean she is able to join the WiFi network but cannot receive or send any data after connecting, she can't even access the modem GUI via a web browser after connecting to the WiFi which is really strange to me.  


Her iPhone still doesn't get connection as we can't spoof her MAC, I've tried forgetting the network and rejoining to no avail.  


All of the above symptoms on top of her brother (teenager) previously threatening to cut off her access to the wifi make me think her MAC addresses are being filtered.  


So my question is after getting her to spoof her MAC and then accessing the Modem settings there is no MAC filter entries in place. Is there another way her brother could be targeting her MAC addresses? Like a third party tool etc, if so what is the best way to figure out what it is or monitor it for more info?

I then found out that Shutterbug2000 found out how to do this task. Because of my extended spring-break, I thought this would be a good project to spend time on. Now, for the help I need. I have one of the older 3ds' from around 2010 but the video and forum said that it worked on a newer model. Is there a way to do this on my older model? If it needs more memory, I still have the 2GB  issued SD card that came with the 3ds. I would need to upgrade this if anything were work on it.

After watching a few videos online of how to take apart and clean a controller I hoped i fixed everything but I only fixed settings button and square button, triangle still doesnt work. Also, L2 is now permanently being pressed on even when nothing is actually pressing on the button.R2 switches between not working at all and doing the same thing L2 does. Everything else works fine. 

To specify how i cleaned the controller i took all the buttons off the external case and cleaned it with dish soap then dried it. Then i individually cleaned and dried the buttons. I didnt do a thing to L1 and L2 just put it to the side. I also didnt do anything to the board beneath the buttons, even though the juice mightve gotten there i dont have tech cleaning stuff so i didnt wanna risk ruining it.

I have multiple Netgear powerlines which are all 1200. But I have yet to experience any speed above 100mbps and I have determined that it is the Netgear that is bootlegging the speed. 

The apartment that I moved into was built with in the last 5 years

The router can provide up to 1900mbps, also meaning 1.9gb. 

All the ethernet cables are cat7 and brand new.

I have put the master powerline and the slave powerline in the same room, less than 10 feet from each other (Also, there is no difference from the master and slave, just the master is connected to the router via a cat7 ethernet cable and the slave is the one connected to the wall which then connects to a computer).

I have reset both of them, the master and the slave, and I have unpaired them and paired them.

Can someone please help me, I have no clue what could be the issue, I was on Netgear tech support all day and they have no clue either. 

there are tones of people with the same issue but I can't find an answer to fix this.

Oh also, this might be important to solving the issue of finding an answer, there is a total of 3 slaves and one master and they all have the same issue. They all can't produce more than 100mbps.

I can boost the volume through Windows' settings, but +10dB makes me go from inaudible to barely audible and +20dB adds a lot of background noise, but even then, this would not really be a solution, more of a workaround

Googling i can see that there are other people with this problem, but the only suggested solution that i could find (other than boosting the mic) was reinstalling my Realtek drivers, but that didn't help me

I'm fairly certain that the issue is a software issue (unless my headset is defective) the thing is that i'm not sure if the problem comes from the headset or from Windows 10 since i can find lots of people that have my problem with both, but i have no other PC to try the headset on nor any other mic that i can try on this one

- tried booting without the gpu, nothing changed.

Removed the HDD and it turns off while I'm looking at the Bios options, or it doesn't even gets at the bios. Well, it eventually gets to the bios after 5 or 10 restarts. 

Removed 1 ram stick, then exchanged with the other one, then changed ram slots... Nothing changes...

Took everything off the case, changed the motherboard little battery(I know, I'm desperate).

I’ve never posted on reddit before, I have no idea about anything tech-related so I’m a bit in a panic. 

About 2 days ago, I spilled about half a cup of tea (not hot) with milk and sugar in it all over my keyboard. 

Followed regular steps, immediately powered it off, let it air dry upside down. After about 24 hours, although I wish I could have let it sit longer, I had something very important to submit for school so it was on (verrrry slow and fan was blowing like crazy) for about 15 minutes before I shut it back off for another 36 hours. 

I meant to let it sit for longer but as I was checking the status of my sticky keys I accidentally turned it back on and it booted up pretty fast. I thought might as well use it since it was already on, so I opened google chrome, typed in a random website, all was good and I shut it back off. I plan to let it sit upside down for another 12 hours. 

My laptop seems to be running just fine. I know some corrosion (is that the term?) is probably going on inside but is there anything I should worry about for now? or should I just use it for the next two months or however long until it gives out?

I' m on 144hz, I average about 200-300 fps in CS:GO but my game is running terrible. It is so choppy, it' s unplayable. When running around, especially when turning/strafing, my screen just tears apart. It is impossible for me to play consistent like this, it' s unplayable. I am not exaggerating.

My CSGO runs like dogshit for half a year now, i thought i would give ReviOS a shot. ([https://sites.google.com/view/meetrevision](https://sites.google.com/view/meetrevision)) (Yes, i tried a default ISOs of Windows 10 Pro as well)

Back to ReviOS. Got 1709, got average +40-50 fps increase/better latency and an overall good performance outside of CS:GO but my problem is still there. Unfortunately. I followed the Post-Install guide ([https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEqG0M8ijTBm4L\_q2hubVrzdK5dOZ2no0qJ3LEgJNUU/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEqG0M8ijTBm4L_q2hubVrzdK5dOZ2no0qJ3LEgJNUU/edit)) did everything except the advanced tweaking stuff at the bottom.

I am out of ideas. Is something in my PC broken? If yes, what is it? Can a faulty DVI-D cable be the problem since i get heavy screen tearing even though my fps are fine? Faulty RAM? Only happens in CS:GO. I wish i could just upgrade to a better PC but that is not possible at the moment unfortunately.

The only way to stop the fan is to reboot the laptop. I have found out that because of the fan grinding my PC is starting to overheat more, so I believe that it would be better if the fan is turned off.

I have also heard that it is extremely difficult to repair it, and I would also have to repair the screen when opening up the laptop in which case it would be better to just save up for a PC altogether. My warranty has also ended years ago so there isn’t anyway I can get a replacement.

fs6y63,JamalBruh,Locked out of computer on disabled Administrator account,"This all started with me trying to hyphenated my username to stop certain programs from having errors due to the space.

Through a series of (apparently) ill-advised command prompt, I ended up losing access to my original account, and being stuck in Administrator mode, with no option for logging back into my other account on the login page.

I tried to fix this by entering the following commands:


**net user administrator /active:no** and **net user Jamal_Bruh /active:yes**, and then **shutdown -L**.

But when I went to log back in, the Administrator account was still the only option.


But now when I try to go in, it (naturally) says: ""Your account has been disabled. Please see your system administrator.""

And since my old account still isn't showing up, I'm virtually locked out of my computer. The how-to videos on YouTube all asset that there's a power button on my login screen, but there isn't--just wi-fi and Ease of Access, so that's a no-go.

Any advice on how to get things unlocked again without just having to wipe everything on my computer away would be very appreciated.",4,1585631525,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs6y63/locked_out_of_computer_on_disabled_administrator/,techsupport,1
fs6xg9,Akuvo,"Mic issues, driver issue possibly?","I have a modmic uni  
When I first got it, it wasn't working at all. It would have some static noise but it wouldn't pick up my voice at all. I tried a ton of things, and eventually disabled a couple of audio drivers and it worked. Recently, while playing a game, it stopped working again. Back to making the static noises and not picking up voice at all. I went through enabling and disabling different audio drivers again trying to fix it, thinking that the first time it was some kind of conflict, to no avail.   


Not sure if this is important, but worth mentioning, the mute/unmute toggle is flipped on my mic. It's a production issue, when it's on mute it's unmuted and vice versa. They offered to replace it, but I doubt it's related as the mic works fine when plugged into my phone.  


In device manager, I have the following Sound/video/game controller drivers (may have been a coincidence that it fixed it last time, but just in case)  
Intel(R) Display Audio  
NVIDIA High Definition Audio

When I plug it into my computer it makes the chime that a new device is plugged in. But I’d does not show up in the My PC drives. 

After exploring around I found that the drive does show up in Device Manager and in the Devices and Printers part of control panel but does not show up in Disk Manager at all, not even an unformatted drive. 

Following basic google my problems protocol, a lot of websites said check the driver and what not, which I did to no avail. Uninstalled the driver restarted and plugged the drive back in, nothing.

My next thought was the wire or USB mini b port was messed up, which I tried another wire and that didn’t work. So I took the casing apart and plugged into a standard Sata data/power port, and I have the same issues.

I then tried to use a data recovery software, which I know nothing about and wasn’t sure they worked for this sort of thing. So I just went with googles first result which was M3 Data Recovery. I first tried a RAW Drive recovery which said it failed, then the data recovery and said they failed as well, but unsure if they worked that well, I saw a drive there that seemed like it was the broken one but the recovery tool only said it was 12 MB.

Anyway my query is that, is it at all possible to get any data off this drive or am I totally screwed and the drive is toast. Most of the data is photos.",8,1585629190,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs6fs5/seagate_portable_backup_drive_read_issues_win_10/,techsupport,1

fs62wr,JasperFoxtrot,Help - PC Head-FI Set Up Hiss,"Hi everyone,

I built a new PC just a few days ago, and and when using my head-fi set up I find a new, audible hiss that wasn't present with my old PC.  I have been in an out of these forums and and nothing I find seems to address the problems I'm experiencing.  I'll start with the weird stuff, below that are the things I have tried to this point.

The hiss only starts when I windows boots.  I can be in the bios looking at power settings and fan speeds for however long I need, and the hiss is not present at all.  

I can unplug the DAC and still hear the hiss.  This means there is enough of an electrical charge coming through the USB to travel through an un-powered DAC and the headphone amp to create an audible signal.  

First, I thought it was a ground loop issue as the hiss becomes louder as I adjust the volume, but after ensuring all the plugs are on the same outlet, I still have the same issue.  I even checked the outlet itself and it is properly grounded.  

I have removed all other devices plugged into the PC, including the graphics cards, monitors and even individual fans.  I do not believe any of the hardware in my PC is causing the issue (I can still be wrong of course).  I even deactivated all the RGB lights.

I deleted all audio drivers except for that of the DAC.  The problem is not present on any of the headphone jacks, only USB audio.

Everything works as it should when the DAC is plugged into my Surface Pro.

Over the holidays I got a pre-built gaming rig as a gift to myself.  I recently thought it would be cool to have dual monitors, but I'm not quite sure how to do it.

The specific model is the Slate MR BB972.

To my knowledge, the graphics card can support up to four monitors...  I just don't know how to go about doing so since there's only one HDMI out port.  Any help would be much appreciated.

I ordered some new G.SKILL Flare X Series 16gb ram F4-3200C14D-16GFX which is rated at 3200mhz CL14.     
    
I was wondering if it would be best to run it at the 3200mhz CL14 or try to get it running at 3600mhz CL14 instead.       
    
Would it be as simple as choosing XMP for 3600mhz and increasing the DRAM voltage to maybe 1.4 or even 1.5v?      
     
Does it even make sense that RAM would ever cause stuttering? (low 0.1 and 1 maybe?)

While I would be in-game playing with friends (such as modern warfare etc.) My computer seems to stutter for about 3/4 seconds, with heavy frame drops and my inputs from my keyboard and mouse become unresponsive. This would happen every 5 minutes or so, but now it has become a system-wide problem with everything that I try to do, even typing this post right now, my typing would stop completely but all videos/music would play as normal, I can still control the mouse, but I'm unable to type/click anything, my mouse would drag across the screen if I move my mouse then stop, and even typing, nothing would appear on-screen while it stutters, and after it ends, all my text would appear on the screen. 

This has become a super huge issue, and I can't tell if there is a CPU problem because all of my system monitors show no spikes in performance (except when I first log in to windows) and windows is running on my Samsung EVO SSD, it's almost full, but my SSD has been almost full for forever and I doubt in my mind that my pc is running like butt because it's almost full. Does anyone have any ideas? I tried doing a full virus scan on my computer and nothing suspicious shows up at all. I recently cleaned out my rig of dust to see if there were any thermal issues that were causing the stuttering but alas, no solution has come across me.

 I'm not sure if I should do a factory reset of windows, as I have no way of obtaining an external hard drive to back up my stuff. Any suggestions would be amazing!

fs54bx,Dospcoc,Laptop doesn't charge/no indication of charging. Faint ticking sound when plugged in.,"I recently got the P53 model number 20QNS00N00. Run windows 10. It's about 4 months old. 

Today  I went to unplug my laptop and when I did, a pop up said that a battery  couldn't be detected or something like that. It should be known that I  turned on battery threshold between 40-85 percent. Right after I  unplugged it, the battery indicator said it was at 100 percent for quite  a while. I hop on a game and in the middle of the game, the laptop  suddenly turns off like it lost power. It didn't seem like a crash since  there was no blue screen or any beeps, it just suddenly turned black. I  turn the laptop back on and the battery now reads 50 percent and  decreases normally with use.

Now whenever I try to plug in  my laptop, the laptop gives no indication of it being charged, not even  ""plugged in not charging."" The only thing that it does is makes a  really faint ticking sound near the port where I plug in the ac adapter.  I opened the back of the laptop and unplugged/replugged the cable and  nothing changed. The laptop continues to tick and not charge. 

Even when the laptop is completely off, it doesn't charge and it still ticks.

I'm  scared to turn off the internal battery since it doesn't even seem to  charge when the laptop is completely off so I don't think I'd be able to  turn it back on. ",1,1585623570,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs54bx/laptop_doesnt_chargeno_indication_of_charging/,techsupport,1
fs50py,the_tech_dude_,Issues in Hangouts Meet for online classes,"I posted this on r/google and its discord, but no one responded, so I am copying my post here

---

As many others are going through, my university has setup online classes and are using google classroom+hangouts meet.

The problem is that someone from our class leaks the hangout link and allows other students to enter and disrupt the lecture. These other students use their own emails to join, so we have no way of attaching a disruptor to the leaker. They enter by asking to join and someone allowing them to enter the stream.

An answer to the following questions can help a lot:

1. Is there a way to disallow outsiders from even asking to join the stream? I.e. private to only organization members.

2. Is there a way to know who let an outsider join the meeting(clicking on allow entry)?

3. Is there a way to let only the professor allow/disallow outsiders to join?

If anyone can answer any of these please do so, so I can forward it to my university. I think this can help a lot of students and teachers trying to actually get work done.

I made an album on imgur -https://imgur.com/gallery/YicjTMp -  to show the insides of it and Id hope for some opinions of more experienced people if it feels salvagable or not.I was gaming at the time, it made some weird screech noise, the fps droped from 60 to 20 and I turned it off to start trying to dry it out. I made the mistake of turning it on again about one hour later because I was desperate to check if it was still working ( it was, except for the toutchpad, I turned it off quickly feeling my anxiety was making me do something stupid ) . Only after that hour I oppened the laptop to screw off my 2 week old SSD hd and see with my own eyes the damage. I coudnt see any wet part or obviously corroded piece but a long copper piece ressembling a snake I have no idea what it is seemed to have taken most of the damage and was a bit off. After trying to fix it back to the original position I realized the thing wasnt firm and nearly broke in half as you can see in the album.     

  The first thing I tried doing was to discover what the piece was but I didnt find out. i figured I wasnt doing anything helpfull and decided to go to bed and hope for it to be next day... As expected, it wasnt. It turns a single light on when I press power but nothing else seem to start working and it stays like that. To me it feel only the batery is there, powering nothing else.

  This was like the worst timing for something like this to happen as I am quarentined, with the entire semester canceled and was with hopes of taking that time to game and chill. Well that isnt going to happen so I started studying like the semester was still happening ( like I probably should ) There are no stores open so I cant send it to a repairshop yet but the anxiety is killing me. What is this piece? Does it looks salvagable, but expensive even? Or is it most likely dead for good? I would be really glad to have some eyes on this...

1- Starting Saturday at 11pm, and all day Sunday, the internet speed was snooozin range of .3 upload and .3 download. We should be getting 10 Mbps download, 1 Mbps upload.  I called their support team who said they'll have someone call back. I did a lot of plugging unplugging and waiting at this time with no avail. I took break.
2 - Support team left a VM a couple hours later. I called back and while on hold, I tested the internet, and realize the wifi password was changed.
3 - They told me what the 'current' password is, and I gave them the old pw so no one at home needs to update the pw on multiple devices. 
4 - Monday, around 6:00pm, I see '[blah blah] 2' that I've never seen before, and it doesn't appear on any other connected devices.
 
I lived in the city where my router had 2.4GHz and 5GHz, and named 'abc' and 'abc 2', but in this area, I just took their free router.

fs4688,FRO_oh,PC does not post when XMP is enabled - Please help.,"**Issue:** Installed 32GBs of Corsair vengeance pro RGB 3200mhz DDR4 ram (16x2) into an Asrock z170a-x1/3.1 motherbored with an i7-6700K.
Without turning on the XMP feature in the BIOS the PC boots and operates fine (even passed built in Mem tests), but the moment I activate the XMP profile in the BIOS, the computer refuses to boot (it will continue to do so until I hard reset it a couple of times and the bios detects that it is failing to boot and allows me to go back into the BIOS and turn off XMP).

**What I've tried:**
* Reseating the Ram. 
* Rearranging the Ram. 
* Replacing the Ram completely with new ram (tried a different set of the ProRGB ram and 2 different sets of Corsair Vengeance PLX 3000 mhz (8x2) ram as well) (all 4 sets work in other machines of mine perfectly fine in xmp).
* Updating the bios and chipset.
* Removing Cmos battery and letting the Bios reset.
* Replacing the Motherboard - I had the exact same mobo in storage, new in box, same issue.
* trying to boot without graphics card connected.
* I've called Corsair, they told me the motherboard doesn't support the PLX ram (it does) and couldn't give me a straight answer about the Pro ram (as the motherboard is verified to support it).
* I've tried contacting Asrock and have heard nothing, not sure if they'll ever get back to me.
* A couple more things that I don't believe would be related to the problem.

I'm stumped, not sure what to do, and would honestly love help.

**The only things I could think of being possibly the culprit are:**
1. I'm upgrading from ECC Ram (what I had laying around when first setup the machine, I doubt this would cause this though).
2. something is wrong with the XMP profile Asrock has setup.

Spec sheet:
* i7-6700K CPU
* Asrock z170a-x1/3.1 motherbored 
* Corsair vengeance pro RGB 3200mhz DDR4 ram (16GBsx2)
* nh-d15 CPU cooler 
* Samsung SSD (replaced these a couple of times whilst testing, they're all new or working)
* EVGA GTX 1080 OG FTW
* RM 850x PSU

Also posted in Pcmasterrace, figured I should put this here too...

Alright, I'm not all that great at organizing my thoughts, so bare with me.

The other day my brother and I were playing a game together when his computer suddenly shut off without warning. When he pressed the power button to try and turn the computer back on, the power button LED lit up briefly and then shut off. Also, the case fans turn about a 5th of a turn and then stop. Some RGB and LED elements turn on inside the computer, but nothing else happens. As I mentioned in the title, we replaced the PSU and the computer still presents with the same symptoms. I'm going to do my best below to summarize the hardware.

GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 950.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 of some sort. I can't remember exactly which model.

MoBo: Some sort of Asus STRX, about 2-4 years old, if that helps.

PSU: Powerspec 650 bronze semi-mod.

Don't remember what brand the RAM is, but I believe its 16 GB DDR4.

Storage is a Tb SSD.

Sorry I can't do much better than that right now. I built this computer about 4-5 years ago and recently gifted it to my PC-challenged brother. I'd have him check the device manager, but... well, you know. Any info you have on which part might be the issue is appreciated.

I am regularly able to hit 60fps in battlefield 1, and other games, according to the in-game fps counter, but I have been a tad suspicious that I am not actually *seeing* that 60fps.  As I usually don't see gameplay as buttery smooth as many gameplay clips I see around.  


I was playing verdun heights and accidentally adjusted the volume on my keyboard, causing the windows 10 overlay to pop up on-screen for a few seconds.  During those glorious moments the gameplay came through smoother than I have **ever** seen it.  Sure enough, every time I adjust the volume, the overlay comes up and the gameplay goes buttery smooth. As far as I can tell, the quality does not diminish in the slightest.  As far as I can tell the game is always outputting 60fps, but for some reason it isn't coming through clearly until some overlay from windows appears on-screen. 


I have disabled the ""animate controls and elements inside windows"" and tried to poke around various windows settings for a solution, but most of my searches on this topic just return ""how to disable the overlay"" results.  Honestly at this point I would *love* it if anyone has an idea for how to get the overlay ""stuck"" on-screen for an entire game.  Obviously implementing the actual fix would be a lot better, but I'll take a hack if anyone has an idea.

I would like to state that she already has a new laptop so I can do a little more tricky fixes if we need to because her work paid for her to get a new laptop because it broke while she was using it at work. 

So in the video, I linked it shows that the turns on but all you can hear are the fans and the with start pulsing. If you hold the power button while it's plugged in it will turn off but when you release the button it will turn on and do the same thing. I have tried taking the HDD, SSD, and RAM out and it does the same thing. I have tried getting it to boot top bios and this also doesn't help. I unplugged the battery and plug the computer back in and it also does the same thing. I tried plugging it into a monitor and this also showed nothing. 

Since we don't really need this laptop and she got one paid for I am willing to learn with it if I need to. Such as use my multimeter and soldering iron if something is actually shorted on the motherboard. 

If you need any more info or pictures/videos please just let me know and I will try to get them to you as fast a possible.

fs3sbi,lilshannon21,CPU Random Shut-Offs - not related to CPU Temps,"Hi /r/techsupport,
I built a new PC recently (End of December 2019) and have been having random shut offs recently, with increasing frequency. Originally, it would only happen when under a bit of stress (Gaming + Discord + Stream + Assorted Chrome tabs). This led me to believe it was likely a cooling issue with the CPU so I replaced the thermal paste, cleaned fans (though they were very new so much to clean anyway), and reinstalled Windows to make sure it wasn't any corrupt files as well. It worked great for 2-3 days but now the shut offs are back. Now it has turned to shut off really any time, even with CPU temps (Via CoreTemp) under 60 Celsius consistently. 

That being said, I've noticed that sometimes when I turn on my PC the Power Supply glows red (indicating some problem?) where other times it pulses blue. When it starts with red on my CPU lasts anywhere from 10 second to 15 minutes before it shuts off but when it's blue there are virtually no problems.  That last bit brought me to think it's probably a Power Supply issue. I would love to provide you wonderful people with my make and model but, unfortunately, I can't even tell what the brand of my power supply is because the receipt from MicroCenter isn't helping. It's labelled as follows: ""IPSG 850W 80+ GOLD FULLY PSU"". 

Ultimate questions being: 

1. Anyone know wtf power supply I bought so I can look into a user's manual and maybe troubleshoot?

2. If the issues for random shut offs are not (CPU) heat related, what might the cause of random shut offs be? 

2b. Is my assumption right that it's Power Supply or does the glowing even matter?

Background: Bought a Logitech Brio so I could play card games and now due to COVID-19 interview.

&amp;#x200B;

Issue: The webcam won't display video (read on) but the microphone works.  It does display video initially on things like skype and google hangouts.  Then the video dies until I switch USB ports and it dies again.  I've done this switching 3 or 4 times now and it's failed continuously.  Even restarts won't bring video back on that usb port (I'm actually afraid I'm damaging them).  HOWEVER!  The video continues to work on Logitech G Hub the entire time.

&amp;#x200B;

What I've Done:

\-Checked firmware, all up to date .

\-Checked for Drivers, nothing.

\-Tried changing driver from brio to usb video device (or some combination of that name), no effect.

\-Tried decoupling the control from logitech Ghub, no effect.

\-Tried other services, all fail except Ghub which will still show a video.

fs2s41,JDorian88,Radeon Rx 580 Glitching,"
Ever since I updated to the new version of Radeon graphics software Adrenaline, my graphics card has been having a weird issue. Please see the image I’ve posted. What’s happening is, whenever I open a video or a game or any program that would rely on the graphics, the screen starts glitching like that. I know it’s a software problem because I rolled back to a previous version of adrenaline (prev UI, version 19 build) and it doesn’t do that. I would just keep it on that version, but newer games need updated drivers/software. 

Not sure if anyone else has had this issue, or what you did to fix it? I’ve played with pretty much all the settings in Adrenaline, to no avail. I thought I had luck originally when I turned ‘Wait for Vertical Refresh’ to ‘Always On’, but it only helped for one game session, then started glitching again.

fs2s1p,ObsidianGang,quiet microhpone windows 10 (SOLVED)," after weeks of trying to resolve the same issue i have finally fixed it.  


ok so whenever you plug in a headset it asks you to choose the type, i had been choosing headset/headphones the entire time and messing with the boost and all kinds of settings with no avail, this was the settings shown while headset/headphones was selected

finally i decided to hit ""line in"" when asked which type, while selected as ""line in"" whenever i opened up my audio console ""realtek audio console"" i realized a new section had appeared for ""line ine"" and the volume was turned way down, 

[https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/358222806238101505/694341435603943485/Screenshot\_4.png?width=1040&amp;height=585](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/358222806238101505/694341435603943485/Screenshot_4.png?width=1040&amp;height=585)

so i turned it all the way up, unplugged the headphones replugged them in and selected ""headset"" and boom, my mic is now loud. im guessing the issue has something to do with the driver not registering the microphone on your mic thus not allowing you to adjust the headsets mic settings, but once you select ""line in"" it recognizes the microphone on your headset and allows it to be adjusted. i hope this helps, i made an account just to reply to all the forums posts about this issue lol",1,1585614558,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs2s1p/quiet_microhpone_windows_10_solved/,techsupport,1

fs2hu1,Maurarg,NVMe drive performance Issue,"Hi!   
Recently I noticed that my 1 year old Gigabyte NVMe 1.3 SSD 265GB M2 2280 PCIe x2 GP-GSM2NE8256GNTD ([https://www.gigabyte.com/ar/Solid-State-Drive/GIGABYTE-M2-PCIe-SSD-256GB#kf](https://www.gigabyte.com/ar/Solid-State-Drive/GIGABYTE-M2-PCIe-SSD-256GB#kf)) slowered down for an unknow reason.   
Gigabyte says that speed rates are 1200 MB/s Read and 800 MB/s Write for my drive. When I bought it (about a year ago) and did the proper configurations on my PC, CrystalDiskMark benchmark showed 1102MB/s (Read) / 703MB/s (Write) in Sequential test, but now I´m getting 1020MB/s(Read) / 224 MB/s (Write). Read speed slowed down around 10% but Write speed rate now is very slow.   
Programs like CrystalDiskInfo, Gigabyte SSD Tool Box, HD TUNE are showing 100% on Health Status and no error on SMART. I´m using an UPS, so the computer never suffered a power failure.  


My specs are:   
&gt;!\- Intel Core i7 8700K 
- Msi Z370 Gaming plus 
- 16GB RAM DDR4 3000mhz Teamgroup T Force 
- Gigabyte NVME M2 2280 256GB
- SSD SATA 480GB HyperX Savage
- HD SATA 1TB Western Digital Blue 64MB
- HD SATA 500GB Western Digital Blue 16MB
- Nvidia GTX 1060 6gb
- Sentey Golden Steel Power 1050w 80+ Gold Modular. !&lt;

What I  tried to fix :   
\- Secure Erase, with Gigabyte SSD Tool Box and from BIOS settings.  
\- 10% free unformatted space of 256GB  
\- Latest Bios upgrade  
\- Fresh Windows 10 installation  
\- MSI CD and online provided drivers , Intel Autodetection driver installation, IoBIT Driver Booster software and DriverPack software  
\- Checking for thermal throttle (32°c iddle, 45°c under full load), but same result on both temperatures.  
\- Disconnecting all sata drives, only M2  
\- AHCI and M2 Genie mode in BIOS settings  
\- CLEAR CMOS.  
\- Unplug and plugin the drive from motherboard  
\- All combination in Write-caching policy on disk property.   


Doing some research, this nvme ssd uses Microsoft stornvme driver, and no aditional or specific software/driver installation to make it work.

I will do my best to provide as much info as I can.   


In January I built a PC. The motherboard I am using is MSI (MSI z390 Gaming Edge AC). I am using Discord to game with friends and at first I had no audio and none of my friends could hear me. After a bit of problem solving it seemed like I needed Nahimic installed so that Realtek would work properly. I got all of that set up and everything seemed OK. In the last month or so my friends have been expressing that they have been having a hard time hearing me and that I am too low. I went into Nahimic and turned on the boost for the microphone and all seemed OK for a little while. Until now.   


The issue now seems to be that as I raise the volume of my voice at some point my mic sharply increases the gain making everything too loud for them. This seems to be remedied by going into Nahimic and turning the microphone boost from 1 to 3 then back to one (tons of trial and error brought me here)

The headset that I am using is the Corsair HS50. It is not a USB headset and it is plugged into the front port of my case (3.5mm jack) which goes to my MOBO.   


I am not sure if the issue is my headset, Nahimic (leaning that way), or what  


**TL;DR :** Gaming headset boost gain from zero to 100 with increase of voice volume. leaving me either too low or making my friends deaf.

I have a gaming computer that I bought from a friend that was working up until a few months ago. 

Everything was working fine until one day it wouldn't turn on anymore. The LED for the power light would come on but nothing else (no POST and no fans). My brother gave me his motherboard and CPU to try it out. When I used his motherboard and CPU, the computer would turn on but there were beeps (insufficient power to GPU). I bought a new PSU and tried it out with both CPUs/motherboards. My motherboard would have the same issue (only LED light), his motherboard would start up everything with no beeps but there was also no video output received.

I tried his RAM in my computer, same problem. His GPU, same problem. New monitor, new cable, same problem. 

It seems to me that my PSU shorted out and fried my motherboard and his motherboard is faulty (it was in storage for over a year). We can rule out the GPU and RAM of being an issue since I tried different hardware there and it was still giving no video output. I also tried the onboard graphics and it was the same issue. 

Can we confirm that it's my motherboard that is the issue? I find it weird that the computer would boot but there being no output at all (with no beeps, and I can confirm that the speaker was plugged in).

Any help would be appreciated here. Many thanks.

\-Upgraded the BIOS

\-Reset the BIOS info to both ""BIOS defaults"" and factory settings

\-Performed system diagnostic check both on Dell website/support assistant and through the error screen itself.

\-Updated Windows 10 to the most current iteration.

\-Run the following in the command prompt:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

and

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

\-Replaced the CMOS battery

(None of the completed system scans returned anything other than ""all clear"")

After googling this, I figured it was something to do with drivers, so I went into computer management and downloaded the most recent drivers. The screen still continued to go black, so I tried uninstalling the drivers and reinstalling them. She then received another blue screen error which said VIDEO\_TDR\_FAILURE and amdgrfxg.sys was what failed. I tried putting this into google and I couldn't seem to find anything on that particular failure. I turned instead to just googling the problem to see if I could find another solution. I tried searching for corrupt files, testing the memory, as well as updating the drivers again and uninstalling/reinstalling. The computer is getting to the point where it is almost unusable as its freezing and going black more and more often, and my mom said that went she powered it down after it happening earlier it happened again as soon as the computer came back on before she could even log in. It doesn't appear to do it during certain times, but it seems to happen randomly according to her and from what I've seen. Any help would be appreciated as we can't just bring it in to get looked at right now, and I feel like it shouldn't be having issues as it essentially brand new. I am, however, not very good with technology, so I could be missing something basic, and I apologize in advance if I missed anything.

fs1pvv,EeK09,Green tint on screen after Windows 10 March 28 updates,"I'm on Windows 10 Pro 1909, and after the last couple of Quality Updates, installed on 03/28 (KB4551762 and KB4537572), every time I turn on or restart my PC, my display has a green tint, as if the HDMI bandwidth has exceeded what's supported by the panel (I've seen it happen when trying to run older games supersampled to 8K, with YCbCr422/10 or 12 bpc - fixed by switching to RGB/8 bpc).

My display is an LG OLED C9 (which offers native 4K@60Hz or 1440p@120Hz), and my GPU is a 2080 Ti, running the latest drivers (445.78). I checked the Nvidia Control Panel after booting, and noticed that Windows was defaulting to the first TV resolution of the list, under ""Ultra HD, HD, SD"": 4k x 2k, 3840 x 2160 at 60 Hz, with YCbCr422 and 12 bpc as the color format and depth, respectively.

The actual native resolution, added via CRU (Custom Resolution Utility), is listed under ""PC"": 3840 x 2160 (native), at 66Hz. I made sure to include it at the top slot in CRU, under ""Detailed resolutions"", in order to truly make it the native res and the one to which Windows defaults after booting, which worked perfectly fine until a few days ago.

After the March 28 updates, Windows started defaulting to the incorrect (non-native) res, which is still technically supported and shouldn't be causing any issues. In fact, switching the resolution/refresh rate and color format/depth after the initial boot causes the green tint to disappear and the image to be displayed correctly. Switching back to the initial default settings set by Windows does **not** cause the issue to occur again.

Any ideas as to what's going on and a possible, definitive fix?",1,1585610686,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs1pvv/green_tint_on_screen_after_windows_10_march_28/,techsupport,1

Just got my ATH-M50XBT headphones and I really love them (been using the corded version for years).  
  
However, I'm noticing an issue when I have them paired to my PC. It's a desktop PC and I'm using a [USB bluetooth dongle](https://www.pccasegear.com/products/38432). 
  
I'll do my best to explain it, but please give me some rope here as I'm a bit of a luddite.  
  
So, when playing music or watching videos or playing games, they work great. No issues whatsoever.  
  
However, when no audio is playing, the headphones seem to 'turn off'. I go from hearing super faint white-noise/feedback to nothing. And then if I get a notification sound on Windows (like an email or similar), it seems to miss the first 2/3rds of the sound - I only hear the last bit.  
  
How do I correct this so that they're always 'on' and it won't miss notification sounds?  
  
Does the way I've described this make sense? I'll be around all day to answer follow up questions should you need more info.

It's been working pretty well over that time, but two days ago it suddenly started acting up. Whenever I hold a key down, instead of treating it like I'm just holding it down it acts like I'm machine-gun mashing the key. I learned this after I held the shift key down for a moment as I was preparing to write something and I started getting rapid-fire beeps as it registered the StickyKeys command.

The issue is definitely with the keyboard itself. I moved back to an older Logitech keyboard and it's been working fine, but the XG keyboard continued to do the same thing even after I plugged it into my laptop. I've removed and cleaned every key on the keyboard (except the spacebar; there're some springs involved with that one and it's *really* stuck on, so I didn't want to risk damaging it) and soaked them in soapy water overnight, then cleaned the board itself as well as I could, but nothing's changed.

fs1bfq,Fox924,Formatted Drive + Crashing Windows Explorer,"I really apologize for the wall of text, but I feel like this could be interesting for anyone who's up for it.

I have a 4tb Western Digital Mypassport Ultra. About 2.5 years ago, my brother reformatted my drive accidentally. Initially I was able to recover the files (using which program I'm not sure). Then the drive began to fail. If I remember correctly, I wouldn't be able to access the files and windows explorer would crash if I did. On the few times it did allow me, attempts to get pictures off of the drive never completed. I eventually gave up and decided I would come back to it in the future, as I didn't have the money for professional data recovery. I didn't RMA the drive despite being offered it by Western Digital because I wanted to get the pictures off of it. 

Fast forward to around this weekend, I found the drive in a box and decided to give it another go. I still couldn't really access it with recuva or data lifeguard. But data lifeguard said it had too many bad sectors. I don't hear and physical grinding although it does vibrate (which may just be standard for the drive while the disc is spinning?). Upon unplugging, it will make a high pitched beep noise. I'm attempting to use recuva to get the files back. I was able to get recuva to recognize the drive. I then let it deep scan (had to let it do this overnight) and then I just selected all of the picture/video files. They were not named, guess because it was reformatted, and I literally left my computer on for 3 days straight attempting to recover (it said 8 days to recover). Unfortunately last night, I heard the same high pitch beep as though it had been unplugged, and then the recovery went from about 13% to 100% in less than 10 mins. I had to restart the computer. I was going to let it scan again and begin the process over again, but I could not get recuva to recognize it. I ended up giving up and I documented a few interesting events. 

Recuva won't start until drive is physically unplugged. 

Windows explorer freezes/ taskbar unusable if attempt to access the drive. Immediately unfreezes if drive is unplugged. 

Windows won't restart until drive is unplugged. If plugged in just before startup, I will be able to login and my desktop will be shown. It will be blank and a program that usually runs on startup will not run. A white overlay will appear over the screen as if it was loading or something. This disappears upon unplugging drive. The startup program will start upon unplugging the drive. 

Does anyone know what could be causing this? Perhaps the drive wasn't dying physically but something was wrong with the software? I remember reading about maybe the enclosure is bad, but it's soldered onto the drive so it's not like I can replace easily. 

Any advice? If it's software, would reformatting it in hopes of fixing (if I can even access it) harm chances of data recovery?",0,1585609196,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs1bfq/formatted_drive_crashing_windows_explorer/,techsupport,1

fs14nd,robbie2000williams,Seemingly random unrecoverable freezes during heavy load.,"Hi guys, I know there are a lot of people posting problems and not enough resolving on this sub, but any help is much appreciated. I will try to be as concise as possible.

Here I will describe the issue and list my full specs and notable cases below: 

Recently I have noticed that some games on my pc will run for x amount of time and then ""freeze"". The game window will be stuck on a single frame and depending on the game, it will keep running fine in the background (I can jump, shoot, place objects etc.) or only the audio will play but gameplay stops or simply the whole game will freeze. Initially I thought it was a problem with just one game until I noticed extremely similar cases in other games. The only way to recover from this is to kill the process in task manager or as this sometimes fails, to use taskkill in command prompt. The freezing changes in frequency seemingly at random, sometimes 5mins after loading the game, sometimes after 30mins, depending on the game or day.

**Affected games:**

* Absolutely unplayable

1. Skyrim SE (Vanilla): Freezes after between 5min and 20min of gameplay. Unrelated to what I'm doing in game. In combat or not, after being in an area for a long time or just entering/exiting... Freezing can sometimes cause whole system to lock up, usually have to use taskkill.

* Borderline unplayable

1. Middle Earth, Shadow of Mordor: Freezes usually every half hour to hour or so. NOt unlike skyrim, seemingly unrelated to gameplay. Alt + F4 suffices and can restart the game. Game does not continue running after still image like others.
2. Counter Strike GO: Can't get through competitive match w/o at least one freeze. Have to exit via task manager. Gameplay continues in background, can place objects and move, hear all sounds. This is where I first noticed the problem, tried many things to fix assuming it was just a problem in CS until it started happening in other games.
3. Cities: Skylines: Freezes after 20mins-50mins. Still image but gameplay continues, like csgo. Alt + F4 suffices

* Freezing occasionally

1. Fifa 19

* Seemingly no issues/unrelated issues

1. GTA 4
2. Battlefield 4
3. Rocket League
4. My summer car
5. Assassin's creed 1
6. Holdfast
7. Assetto corsa

**So far I have tried:** Reinstalling graphics driver, running games with only one monitor (I run dual monitor setup), changing if the game runs in fullscreen or windowed, lowering settings (I don't beleieve it is a settings issue because games all run smooth, never dipping below 30fps), reseating graphics cards, reseating memory sticks, ran a memory test (0 errors). All to no avail.

**Things I suspect:**

1. PSU: My PC is an old Dell Optiplex 760. Runs very well but I understand it is old and therefore can be problematic. It has had a cpu and MB replacement over the years. Also replaced ram. The reason I think PSU could possibly be a problem is because: 1) It is old. 2) Case can give small electric shocks when unplugged if you bridge certain areas. 3) It is only 240W.
2. Ram: I got cheap ddr2 from amazon, works fine and neither BIOS or Windows detect errors. Could be a factor though.
3. Graphics card not seated properly: It's an old PC with a gen1 PCIex16 connector for the card. I push it in as far as I can but it never seems to sit perfectly in the slot.
4. MB Problem: It's old so maybe the buses dont give enough power for the card? I'm no expert so this is just a guess.
5. For my old PCI WLAN card (yes, PCI not PCIe) to work I had to allow drivers to install w/o certificate in the windows boot menu. Have no idea if this could be related but who knows?

Thankyou so much to anyone who helps, even if it's just recalling a similar case and how you fixed it, I really appreciate any help and will stay glued to my PC for any responses.

**TL;DR: Some games freeze randomly in the same fashion, issue repeats in many games so likely not a game issue. Sometimes image is still but gameplay continues.**

fs142b,ProMyBroCuber,OLD Hard Disk Drive,"So I got new PC few months ago, because my last one stopped working(long story behind it). Now it can't be turned on and I have many many old pictures, when I was kid, pictures of my family, holidays etc.
This is probably stupid question, but I need to ask, to be sure it's possible!
The old PC was bought back in 2006, and it has an  old HDD. When I was kid, I downloaded many things from Internet and I'm scared that there is probably a lot of viruses. So my question is, am I able to somehow connect HDD to my new PC, without losing any data and safely(without getting viruses)? I would like just to copy pictures, paste them to my new HDD and disconnect it. Maybe if it's possible, I could delete (or formate if that's the word) that drive and use it as storage for pictures :D Of course I would firstly backup them :)

fs0tby,FutsNucking,Freesync Stutter,"I'm currently having a problem where my freesync stops working after exactly 3 hours and 10 minutes of my PC being on. Games begin to microstutter heavily with freesync on (tested with windmill demo). Only way to fix is to keep rebooting my PC after 3 hours.

Frame rates are high. I've noticed that the stutter happens when the FPS dips below 144 Hz. 144 Hz feels smooth but limiting my frames to 143 Hz feels choppy.

PC Specs:

RX 570 4GB

Ryzen 5 1600

MSI B350M Gaming Pro

16 GB 3200 MHz RAM

Monitor: MSI G24C 144 Hz Monitor

Things I've checked/tried:

* Temps are normal (GPU and CPU both below 75C)
* Enabling/disabling HPET in Windows (BIOS has no option to turn on/off)
* Resetting monitor.
* Using different display cable.
* Updating BIOS.
* Changing mouse polling rate
* Enabling/disabling freesync in Radeon settings
* Using ISLC to clear standby memory

I have no idea what else to do. This problem has been consistent for months now and I've looked everywhere for help. I'm assuming a process is starting up at the 3 hour 10 minute mark that is causing the freesync to start but I can't pinpoint it.

fs0oyh,TheSCientist99,Router gets speed boost after restart but quickly returns to normal - Why?,"For reasons I don't need to get into, despite being a heavy internet user I have 4G home broadband. The speed is far below advertised so I'm always looking out for ways to improve it. Consistently I find that when I restart the router it often boosts the speed by a factor of 2 or 3, only for it to return to its ""equilibrium"" value after 15 or 30 mins. The speed boost is real and measurable and suggests that those higher speeds are possible but something else is limiting the download speed. Can anyone explain this?

For general info I have the Huawei-535 that comes as standard with Three 4g home Broadband in the UK. Also, once the speed drops it very rarely (if ever) goes up again. I notice the effect particularly when downloading games, and that the ""equilibrium"" download speed is around 0.5MB/s.",0,1585607030,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs0oyh/router_gets_speed_boost_after_restart_but_quickly/,techsupport,1

fs0m77,GhettoSpaghettio,Gaming PC can no longer play games,"Hey all, being stuck in quarantine and all, I decided to finally use my MSI gaming laptop for its intended purpose, gaming. Here are my specs. 


MSI GS63 Stealth
Processor: Intel 8th gen core i7-8750H
Graphics card: GEFORCE GTX 1060
Video memory: 6gb GDDR5
System memory: 16GB DDR4 -2666MHz
Storage: 256gb ssd, TB HDD


For the past three weeks or so it’s been working like a charm, I was running games like The Witcher 3 at 60fps ultra settings and basically no loading screens. However a couple days I went to boot it up to find that, not only are load times taking upwards of a minute, I now can barely run the game at 20fps at the lowest graphical settings. I should also say that I am not a technologically inclined person, hence why I’m using a pre-built gaming laptop. I’ve tried running a Windows security scan, updating windows, and updating my drivers, which temporarily alleviated the problem. I could run games at ~50-60fps with long load times. However the next day is was right back to chugging along at 15fps. I reinstalled the drivers and it went back up, only to once again start underperforming today. Does anybody have any ideas as to what could be causing this?",10,1585606766,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs0m77/gaming_pc_can_no_longer_play_games/,techsupport,1

fs08be,UrDreamDaddy,Need help with hardware choice for Rift s," 

Hey, I need some help with choosing components for my Pc.

I got my Rift s a couple of days ago and I currently I have a 1060 6GB, a Ryzen 5 1600 and a X370 Asus motherboard. I soon noticed that many titles such as Boneworks and Stormland are not very well optimized and have pretty high recommended specs.

So I thought of upgrading my PC in maybe June or July. My budget will be around 800 euro. Although my budget is pretty big Im not looking to spend it all if not needed.

I looked at some benchmarks and it seems like just upgrading my gpu to a 2060 would do? Maybe I should wait for Nvidias new series to drop or perhaps I upgrade my Cpu to a ryzen 5 3600, my gpu to a 2060/2070 and my motherboard to a x570? What is a good choice, because I want to be able to play at high settings with a smooth framerate.

Thank you in advance :)",1,1585605536,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fs08be/need_help_with_hardware_choice_for_rift_s/,techsupport,1

I activated 2 factor authentication now and changed the password of course. I didnt use the infected PC anymore. Now I got an E-Mail that was sent from ""My Mail Adress"" via houmonshinryou""Dot""com. I wouldt recommend clicking on this website. The Mail says I have to pay 1000 USD or some kind of Video of me gets leaked.

""You may not know me, and you are most likely wondering why you are receiving this email, right?  
In fact, I posted a malicious program on adults (pornography) of some websites, and you know that you visited these websites to enjoy  
(you know what I mean).""

First of all I didnt visit a website like that on the PC with the Virus.

""The first part shows the video you watched (you have good taste, yes ... but strange for me and other normal people),  
and the second part shows the recording of your webcam.""

I know there cant be some kind of this Video, because like I said I didnt watch any porn on that PC at all. Just for gaming. I dont even have a webcam lol.

I wont pay obviously and will report it to the police. But I wonder if he has still access to my mail or what does that ""My Mail Adress"" via ""Website"" mean ? Is this some kind of fake so that I think it was really sent from my mail account to myself ?

For real I dont know where I got the virus from but not frome a porn site! I think I downloaded a ""wrong"" file for a game..

fs01uk,NetsuDagneel,Impossible to factory reset my Windows 10,"I'll give you the whole story, so you can have all the information:

After using sudo apt-get update &amp; upgrade on my Linux Mint (dual boot), something went wrong and my grub no longer worked and my PC returned ""something went terribly wrong"" whenever I boot it up (boot up - my PC, not Linux), I got this fixed however, but could not boot up Linux or reinstall it from a USB (it wouldn't be my first time needing to fix grub or reinstalling Linux), nothing worked, so around 1am the next morning I wasn't thinking straight, I deleted all of my Linux partitions (original goal after not getting grub back up again), but also by accident deleted a vital partition for Windows (roughly 100mb in size). This move broke my Windows side, but through searching for fixes I stumble upon one which allowed me to "" restore and repair"" the broken partition. This did work, it got me booted back into Windows and I didn't lose any files either... I couldn't exactly remember everything I used to fix it. Nor can I find the fix again, I just remember a lot of bcdediting things.

After repairing the partition, I wanted to format my Windows, hoping to remove all the problems keeping me from reinstalling Linux. When I tried resetting my PC from the settings, it just said ""Could not find Recovery environment - Insert your Windows installation or recovery media and restart your PC with the media""
I searched a few sites for answers, one telling me I should use bcdedit again, but when I tried to use it in that scenario, it kept telling me something about not being able to change whatever I should change (note, this was still early in the morning), also when I type bcdedit /enum, it returns ""The boot configuration data store could not be opened. - The volume for a file has been externally altered so that the opened file is no longer valid.""
I tried contracting Windows support (not by calling, I'm still in school and have no money of my own to pay for the cost of contacting them), after getting past an AI, to a human, the guy just never responded after asking me if I tried to reset my PC via settings (I answered yes).
I was getting pretty agitated now, so I decided to put a new Windows 10 on a USB (using the Windows 10 Media Creation tool they have on their website), but now my PC doesn't want to boot off a USB (the USB is bootable, I tested it on the family desktop just to make sure), there is no ""USB Lexar"" boot device like there had been previously been in my BIOS and I can also not use ""Advanced startup"" to boot to a USB, since the Advanced startup screen now only has 2 options in it, shut down and configure UEFI(?) firmware (it just reboots to the BIOS). I then decided to use the media creation tool to then ""update current Windows"", but it just, after all the processing and downloading, said ""Could not tell if your PC was ready to update"" (it failed). Note: I did this because multiple sources said I can format windows using this option.

My current partitions look like this (just in case you need to know): 117mb (unallocated) | Acer (C:) 766.90 GB NTFS Healthy (Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition) | 100MB Healthy (EFI System Partition) | 163.27GB unallocated (this used to be my Linux partition, I couldn't extend the primary partition (C:) over this again to create the 1TB partition I got with the pc) | 1.00 GB Healthy (Recovery Partition)...

I believe my problem is that when fixing the volume, I could have deleted another important partition (explaining the random 117mb unallocated partition randomly laying there), I remember the tutorial telling me to delete another partition before restoring the previously deleted partition... It could also be that the partition wasn't properly replaced? Please help me solve this issue, it is quite a bugger :(...

fs00ol,marrianosa,Problem booting BIOS - Motherboard issue?,"Hi guys,

So I have a problem with my pc and I don´t know what else to do, I´ve done everything I can and I have no idea what´s wrong, and being in quarantine I can´t ask for help. This is my first time posting on Reddit, I don´t know who else to ask and I can´t find the same problem online.

The thing is, **the bios doesn´t boot**. When I start the computer the monitor gets no signal, and the computer stays on for about ten seconds and then restarts itself. It starts to loop like this until l I kill it.

This computer is very new (except for the graphics card), I bought the parts in December, so this strikes me as weird. The specs are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Motherboard**: Asus Prime B365M-A
* **Processor**: Intel Core i7-9700
* **RAM**: 16 GB (2 memories 8GB each)
* **GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960
* One **sdd** with Widows 10 Pro 64 installed on it, and one **hdd**

&amp;#x200B;

It´s very clean and has good ventilation. I removed the RAM memories, switched them, switched slots, removed the graphics card, switched hdd/ssd cards slots.

The only thing that helped was removing the motherboard battery and reinserting it. When I do that, the computer starts for like 2 seconds, shuts down, and then starts again. It takes about 30 seconds for the bios to show up. Now, if I do nothing here and restart, the boot problem would persist, but if I choose to boot the ssd where Windows is installed, I can boot Windows 10 with no problem.

The computer works perfectly once in. Windows even recognizes every part. The thing is, if I shut down or restart my computer, the boot problem still happens. 

**So the only way I can boot the bios and access Windows is by removing the battery.** I believe there is some kind of issue with my motherboard.

Another detail is that when I shut down the computer from Windows, the display shuts down but the computer never does. I have to keep the power button down in order to shut it down.

I really don´t know what´s going on or what to do, it has been working fine until now (minus a few software problems due to ""unofficial"" Windows). If anyone has any idea about what´s going on I would really appreciate the input.

frzrag,BelgianBillie,Issue with UD3900 and USB switch. UD3900 not showing up in adapter display after initial switch.,"I have a screen that i want to share between the Surface Pro 4 and my Desktop. The screen is plugged into the UD 3900 with a DVI cable and then i plugged the UD 3900 into a USB switch that goes to my surface and my desktop. My keyboard and mouse are also plugged into the UD3900.

When i start up the desktop (which has another separate screen) it goes into dual screen mode and everything works fine. When i then click the USB switch, the surface pro 4 recognizes the second screen and mouse/keyboard and everything is fine.

Then when i switch back, the controls and mouse moves over, but the screen remains stuck on the surface, or at least the visual gets stuck on the screen because the surface wont allow access to it anymore. The mouse and keyboard moves over to the desktop pc but not the screen.

What could be causing this issue?

frzngl,InfinityVive,Can you please prove my father wrong?,"Hello everyone, So I have an XFX RX 570 4 GB, and I am trying to do stuff to it (e.g: Undervolt it) but my father (who was used to gaming in the 80s and 90s) who's supervising me (I am 15) doesn't agree with me and keeps telling me that this is dangerous and it can ""break"" the GPU very easily... He told me I can do it on my own responsibility and that he would still disagree with me and that he believes that the GPU's factory default is the best for the GPU and that it provides the best performance (but it's not the case with my RX 570)

He also told me he will only believe what I said when he reads it from a ""reliable source"" and I am sure people here are reliable enough, And as a good son instead of just carrying on I decided to help him by proving his way of thinking wrong and correcting him to the right direction...

So here's what me and him are disagreeing at, He thinks:

1- If I put the GPU's fans at 100% it will be very harmful for the fans. 2 - If I overclock the GPU it will make the GPU break even if the overclock is stable with good temps (I did a lot of research and I know what I am doing) . 3 -If I undervolt the GPU it's very harmful for it and it would decrease it's lifespan even if it's stable. 4- If I increase the Powerlimit it would be also very harmful for the GPU.

So can you folks please prove him wrong? keep in mind I will tell him to read the best reply of yours...",5,1585603676,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frzngl/can_you_please_prove_my_father_wrong/,techsupport,1

The drive had Windows 10 installed on it in an AMD system. My plan was to first see if Windows would boot by detecting hardware changes, then if not, just reinstall. 

Things I've tried to fix this include reinstalling Windows 10 from USB twice, using the clean command in the command prompt (from the Windows 10 USB), using GParted on a Ubuntu USB to format the drive, and install Ubuntu on the drive.

I have a couple other SATA drives in this computer also and tried installing Ubuntu on the 2tb SSHD I have just to say screw it. This is when things get screwy and make me think the motherboard itself may have issues. After installing Ubuntu on the 2tb drive, I can no longer see it connected in the motherboard's BIOS. I play around with settings in BIOS such as UEFI or Legacy boot, and what I think is secure boot which I thought worked like if a Windows version is installed on a drive, the motherboard won't boot anything else, but I may not understand secure boot. 

A short background on the motherboard is that I bought it used on eBay with bent pins unable to boot. I fixed it so it does now boot and was running a version of Linux on it in a different build for a time. So something *was* able to be booted from it before. 

Thanks for reading this and any pointers on how to possibly completely wipe the drive and all partitions would be appreciated.",0,1585603220,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frziiw/how_do_i_get_rid_of_this_windows_error_screen/,techsupport,1

I've got a (2 years?) old model of the XPS 15 9560 with an Nvidia 1050, and I've been struggling through some framerate and stuttering issues recently.

My setup is the laptop, connected to a USB-C hub (CableMasters) which feeds two 1080p U2417h monitors through DP cables. The mouse and keyboard are connected through USB 3.0 ports to the same hub.

When playing League of Legends, if I have a web browser opened up, and sometimes with no other windows open, a few minutes into the game the entire program will stutter and run at drastically a drastically lower frame rate (think 130 down to 30). Smoothness is also severely affected, i.e., it looks worse than I would expect 30 fps to. This extends to operation on the rest of the computer. Buttons are laggy, webpages are slow, programs don't close out, and the normal Windows animations are painfully slow.

A similar thing occurs when I try and play Path of Exile, even on very low settings. Here, though, it is constant, and involves continuous sort of microstutters even when the rest of my computer is operating functionally.

This problem occurs at any level of undervolt (0 to -0.135V) and up to at least 65 mA of Turboboost, both controlled thru the IntelXTU. My SSD (a Samsung M.2) is operating fine according to ATTO and CrystalDisk benchmarks, and the system can deal with Excel sheets comparable to those that slow down my work computer (a 2019 Dell Precision).

Is there any sort of diagnostic that I can perform to pinpoint the problem, or do you all know any fixes / workarounds to where I can play these games on even very low settings? It's my understanding that the 1050 should be able to handle these two games fairly easily.",0,1585602023,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frz5ku/dell_xps_15_9560_gaming_framerate_cpu_throttling/,techsupport,1

I've tried different ports and cables, using programs to try and activate the pixels again, trying to apply pressure to the pixels, but the line remained... Until a couple days ago. The only thing I can think of that I did in that time that would have fixed it is calibrating the monitor in windows settings. The curious thing is that the LCD side panel seems to function fine right now, but when I woke my pc after it being off all night, the line appeared briefly until I logged into windows. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, since it's working fine at the moment, I'm not really looking for an immediate solution as I am curious to what could be doing this and any way to prevent it from happening again in the future. Could monitor calibration settings purely on the software side somehow be able to reactivate dead pixels? Or do you think it's just pure luck and complete coincidence that the line works again? I'm curious to hear theories or any suggestions anyone has.",0,1585601919,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frz4fp/inconsistent_dead_pixel_line_and_what_could_be/,techsupport,1
frz3bj,lucagunz,Dual Monitor/Different refresh rates issue," 

Hey everyone,

So I finally upgraded my setup with a decent second monitor and now I am running into all sorts of problems. My specs as well as the monitors are as follows:

Monitor 1 (Primary): Acer XFA240 (144hz 1ms response)

Monitor 2 (Secondary): Acer ET241Y (60 hz)

CPU: Ryzen 7 2700X

GPU: GTX 1660 (BOTH monitors plugged into here... Primary thru DP, Secondary thru HDMI)

RAM: 8GB DDR4 Patriot Viper

MoBo: ASRock B450M Pro4-F

I recently started streaming, and I got the second monitor for the sole purpose of holding my camera and being able to manage my stream and chat and other things on my second monitor while still gaming. Whenever there is ANY sort of animation or media on my 60hz monitor, it caps my refresh rate on my 144 to what has to be 60 or lower. My game starts running terribly until I minimize every window on the second monitor, and that's on both full-screen and full-screen borderless in game settings.

List of things I have tried so far:

\- Turning hardware acceleration off on Chrome (Worked temporarily - issue arise again)

\- In NVIDIA control panel, using integer scaling on both monitors as well as eachother at different times (Did not work)

\- Setting my refresh rate to different values on my secondary (59, 50 hz)

\- Went into BIOS and tried to activate iGPU for second monitor (unfortunately my hardware doesn't support iGPU)

I know this issue has been around for a while. Ultimately, I don't want to have to sacrifice gaming performance just to have a second monitor. I would use my laptop. I find it silly that this is even an issue, but that's tech! The reason I am making a new post is because I have seen multiple posts on reddit and elsewhere addressing this issue, but from a long time ago (1 year +). Please help!

PS: Is having a 60hz monitor alongside a 144 uncommon? I feel like more people would have this issue and it would be easily fixable, but that doesn't seem to be the case...

Hi guys,

I'm planning to buy a new monitor , the Auros FI27Q-P. Though I have one question regarding its variable refresh rate range. It is officially stated that the VRR range is 48-165 HZ. My question is that what happens if the frame rate goes higher or lower than 165 or 48? Will the Free Sync or G Sync turn off? Will they turn on automatically if the FPS comes in range? What happens if I play a demanding game like RDR2 which its FPS is most likely below the range a lot of times?

frysk7,Clown_RNG,Packet Loss,"Hi,

For at least a month our broadband connection has had high packet loss, in the region of 10%.   Our internet is through a wired BT Smart Hub with Ethernet connection to the computer.  Ive already contacted my ISP and they sent an engineer our who reported nothing wrong, but suspect they are just fobbing me off.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have ping plotted for 48hr to a website to see where there is packet loss occurring.

[https://i.imgur.com/E8vGqJU.png](https://i.imgur.com/E8vGqJU.png)

It seems the packet loss begins after leaving the hub with all subsequent hops having a degree of loss.  

When I run tests on [Packetlosstest.com](https://Packetlosstest.com) it tells me I have around 10% upload packet loss with only a few % download lost, not sure if that helps to diagnose anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if anyone here could assist with interpreting the above so i can try either fix a problem on my end or raise the problem with the ISP again.

I have tried using Voicemeeter, but for some reason as soon as I route the microphone audio from my interface through voicemeeter, I have to use huge buffer sizes (at least 1536 samples) to keep the audio from popping which adds a ton of delay. Even if I was okay with that delay (and it's definitely not ideal), when I route audio from Ableton through Voicemeeter, there seems to be much less delay, meaning that my singing is at least half a second behind the backing track in the call.

fryeq0,kicktomcrash,Seagate external hard drive failure - Teacher desperately needs help!,"My wife is a teacher, and needs to set work online for her students due to the school closures (UK). She has a Seagate 2TB external hard drive. She was transferring some files from the schools network on to it, and it froze, which has damaged it.she already had a lot of files on there as well.

Now, if you plug it into a laptop it will show up like normal, even let you view the files, but it wont let you actually open any. We ran some data recovery software on it and it said no files, even though they all still show up.

Prior to it not booting there was an excel spreadsheet that had gone missing from their desktop. The spreadsheet is important while fixing the laptop is not. I booted to an Ubuntu Live flash drive and searched the entire volume but the file did not exist, so now I'm looking at data recovery.

Normally I would pull the disk and connect it to a Windows machine to run Recuva or Undelete. It's been a few years since I've had to do file recovery so there might be something better out there. The catch is that the SSD is m.2 or PCIE or something and I don't have the USB adapter on hand, nor a spare machine, that will accept that. I'm trying to find a solution that won't require waiting for something from Amazon.

My line of thinking is a Linux app that will do data recovery on Windows file systems, preferably already a part of a live distro, but I am open to any other suggestions.",2,1585599508,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frydzx/deleted_file_recovery/,techsupport,1

frycbc,Pastrami_,Certain games crashing or bugging out after new ram install,"Hello all. I have recently been having strange problems with my PC. Recently, I have been playing 4 games a lot on my PC, GTA V, Destiny 2, Half-Life: Alyx and Halo MCC. GTA V, D2 and MCC have been having problems as of late, but HLA has not been having any problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The problems:**

**Destiny 2:** Destiny 2 will be running smoothly and normally for about an hour, but after the 50 minutes to 1-hour mark, it seems that the crashes begin. The crash goes like this; the game stutters, the windows error sound plays anywhere from 1-3 times in repetition, the game then freezes on a frame, the game audio either continues (so a gun I was shooting will keep playing the sound until the game closes), and then either 1 of 3 things will happen. Either the game screen will turn black and I will have to pull up task manager to close it, the game will freeze on a frame and continue to play audio on repeat, or most commonly, the game will close and I will get a notification telling me to ""Verify Integrity of Game Files"" which I have done numerous times and the game files are fine.

**GTA V:** The game will once again, play normally for about an hour until crashes begin to occur. The crashing is simpler on GTA, the windows error sound plays, the game will simply close and a Rockstar Launcher message comes up telling me the game crashed and if I want to launch again in safe mode, etc.

**Halo MCC:** Halo Masterchief collection acts a little bit more strangely. I was playing through the Reach campaign, and suddenly the windows error sound came on. It froze on a frame and I thought it was going to crash. To my surprise, the game did not crash but it began acting strangely. For example, all game audio began to deteriorate until all I could hear was the sound of a Banshee or a Phantom when it got close. The cutscene following the mission did not have any audio, and at first, it seemed that audio was the only problem. But the game gives you achievement on Steam and Xbox every time you beat a level for the first time on normal, which I had done, but the achievement for the level only came through on Windows 10 as an Xbox Achievement and I was not awarded the achievement on steam. After that, the next mission would not load up and my only choice was to close and reopen the game.

**Half-life Alyx:** I did have one crash in Half-Life but I believe it was just the bug in-game because I had put a bunch of grenades I found into a box and carried it around for a bit, and when I grabbed some from the box the game froze and crashed but I later read about this being a known bug. I believe that this game is not being affected by whatever problem my PC has because it is running through Steam VR and Oculus Link but that may not be related at all.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

&amp;#x200B;

**My PC specs are the following:**

GTX 1060 6GB

i7-8700 @ 3.2GHz (6 cores)

16gb DDR4 @ 2400MHz

256gb SSD

3tb external HDD

&amp;#x200B;

**What I have tried:**

I have done the memory diagnostic and it came back with no errors. the only thing I can think of that I have recently done to my PC is installed a new RAM stick that my friend gave me. Not sure if that has anything to do with it.

I have verified the integrity of the games.

Updated Nvidia drivers and have used Driver Booster 6 to update as many drivers as possible.

I have whitelisted Steam from Avast and Windows Defender.

&amp;#x200B;

**What hasn't happened:**

No blue screens whatsoever. No errors in Unity or any other programs. maybe a problem with steam itself. Everything looks fine and I have no idea what is causing this.",0,1585599363,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frycbc/certain_games_crashing_or_bugging_out_after_new/,techsupport,1
fryc7k,slovakianpartizan,CS:GO randomly freezes for seconds (AMD)," 

Hello guys. So for at least 1 month, I have this problem where my game just freezes for 3 to 5 seconds or sometimes even longer, for example at the start of the rounds it lasts for 8-10 seconds. I have this problem only in CS:GO. I do not experince it in any other game. I have uploaded an example video of my problem. By judging from the video, you can say that it only happens after death etc. but it happens so random that even in an aim duel, i get this. At the start of the round, middle of the round, it just does not matter and my friend say that they can see i lag. My model just holds W and runs. After i get these freezings, there are some things that appear in the console which i think points at the problem and they are;

1. Resource materials\\panorama\\images\\icons\\equipment\\world.svg failed to load.
2. DispatchAsyncEvent backlog, failed to dispatch all this frame. 2076 of 2078 remainingDispatchAsyncEvent backlog, failed to dispatch all this frame. 325 of 2387 remaining

i get this messages after game freezes. sometimes i get only 1 of these messages but sometimes both of them show up at the same time.

I tried cleaning steam cache, checking game files if there is anything missing, i formatted pc, i tried installing the game on ssd or hdd, it does not matter

frxcyi,shubangarang,BSOD issues with Alienware M15 during gaming,"I've been having this error since last summer but back then it used to only happen during Rainbow Six Siege so I stopped playing that game and played much more cpu and gpu intensive games like RDR2, Witcher 3, etc. From the past month or so it started happening in all the multiplayer games. Either windows used to crash or it just goes into bsod if I don't force restart and surprisingly it wasn't happening in any of the single player games. Note that I have played a lot of multiplayer games on this laptop like Overwatch, Rocket League, CSGO, Apex. The list goes on. And it's so disheartening to see your laptop crash in a simple game like csgo. 

I thought it was a temperature issue because well my temperatures WERE pretty high. I repasted and undervolted. Temps dropped down and my games were running fine again except well Rainbow Six. But it has started to go into bsod again sometimes. For example, I'm playing COD Warzone these days and it runs fine and I'm getting good frames and all but it just freezes and bam bsod. 

I have reinstalled windows more than 3 times. Did stress tests to test my cpu and gpu, doesn't crash during that. Tried turning intel turbo boost off. Even reinstalled windows with an image file. 

Note that I'm a 3D animation student and I have never faced a bsod during high load renders or working in a high load software. It's always in games and not just one game. 

Could it be the hard drive or ram? 
I tested my hard drive by some program and it told me the status of hard disk is ""good"". 

I've ran memory test in the boot menu as well. 

If this helps, my most common bsod errors are-
UNEXPECTED STORE EXCEPTION, 
KERNEL DATA INPAGE ERROR

My laptop was bought from the US and I don't have any warranty on it. And I've been to Dell authorized service center  here in my country for servicing before repasting myself but they seem to not know their stuff properly anything beyond basic use laptops.

Okay before you flame me im not very technical with pcs and i dont know if this is on my end but im hoping someone can help me.

So as any good FPS kid i recently downloaded MW Warzone and starting blasting. I played the first day complety fine but recently i have had about 7 crashes in one day and almost none of them were the same so i dont know what to look for.

First crash was something like this (dident get to take a picture in time found online)

: [https://gyazo.com/362bd87e5e71532446768708f968f4bd](https://gyazo.com/362bd87e5e71532446768708f968f4bd)

The pc then continued to Blue screen and turn off.

Second crash i had was a Dev6068 which from my understanding seems to be something a lot get. This is also the one i have gotten a couple of times after.

Third crash was the PC grey screens with the game sound looping in the background forcing me to manually turn the pc off.

I checked PC temp and its doing fine with a respectable 40-60 Celcius. Highest recorded was GPU 65, CPU 50 ish.

This is the pc specs if anyone is interested which in my opinion should be enough to play the game.

(The games graphics also seems to miss behave with some settings resetting every now and then and the games resolution changes to 1280:800 or something along those lines by itself. But that also seems to be a problem with a lot other people due to Moden Warfare being a indie game right)

So far I've tried the following:

* I've checked for overheating. Nothing ever gets above 70-75C.

* I tried playing games on very low settings and I still get the same, no change, sometimes it even crashes on start up. I thought it's because of my PSU since it was a 450W 80plus Bronze. I have since then upgraded it to a CorsairTX850M. Unfortunately, this did not fix the issues I'm having. I had a clean windows install, also this does not work.

* I have stress tested my pc using Furmark and everything runs smoothly. No overheating as far as I can see and I get decent FPS.

Is there anything else I can still try? Thanks!

frwh2e,showyourselfaries,Heard creepy voice on the other end of a voicemail,"Hello all! I'm new to reddit. This is my very first post. I think this is the thread to post this in, but I'm not sure, so please feel free to correct.

Anyways, this happened maybe 20 minutes ago and I can't find anything about it online. Help?

I decided to call my nana and check up on her a little bit ago. I haven't heard from her in a while and she normally calls all the time. I can't go visit her with everything going on because her city is on lockdown due to corona and she is elderly.

Anyways, she didn't answer when I called so it went to voicemail. No biggie. She normally works night shifts so she's probably just sleeping. This was what happened:

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hi Nana! It's me, showyourselfaries. I was just calling to-

Phone: \*Intense static noises\*

Me: Wow, that was weird. I don't know what just happened. It just got really staticy all of a sudden. Anyways, I was just calling to check up on you and see how you were doing. I miss you. I love you.

Phone: \*More static\* \*Muffled man's voice\*

Me: Hello...?

Phone: \*Silent\*

Me: That's weird. I could've sworn I heard someone talking. Anyways, I miss you. I love you. Call me back when you can.

Phone: \*More static\* \*Man saying, ""I'll call you back.""

&amp;#x200B;

I immediately hung up after that. I was so scared and creeped out that I was on the verge of tears. 

I called my nana back after calling my boyfriend and telling him the situation. Nothing happened. It was just a regular voicemail.

What could this be? A glitch in the matrix? A ghost? Phone signals getting tangled? Any help would be great.",3,1585593641,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frwh2e/heard_creepy_voice_on_the_other_end_of_a_voicemail/,techsupport,1
frwgjq,vandivion,Acer Nitro 5 CPU issues,"Hi! I have a known problem with CPU overheating in this laptop. specs: i7-8750H + GTX1060M (Acer Nitro 5)

Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about this problem before buying a laptop. It had very good reviews and it was recommended.  


I'm looking for any tips that will fix my problem: when i'm gaming it can run 130fps (example Doom 2016 on med) but after a while fps drops from 130 to 20 for few seconds, it happens every few minutes and its very distracting (CPU temperature throttling)  


What i've tried:  
\- cleaning dust (no difference)  
\- new thermal paste (slightly better but probably after few months its the same)  
\- using v-sync to drop from 120 to 60fps (even worse, vsync uses alot of CPU, and it seems that GPU temperature doesnt affect CPU temperature)  
\- using laptop pad (no difference)  
\- changing graphic settings of game high/med/low (really no difference for this issue, only ultra is too much)

That how it looks: (GPU is well cooled but CPU hits the limit - constant 95stC in every AAA game since i bought it year ago)

frwg20,tunkor,Wireless network not playing nice with Dell XPS 15 9560,"Hello guys.

In short:

I had issues with my XPS 15 9560 connecting to the wifi on my home network. Only on this specific network and only my XPS 15 has issues, other devices work fine and other wifi networks work fine on this laptop too. Also mind you the XPS 15 used to work on this network for about a year, suddenly it just stopped working.

The laptop has trouble getting onto the network in the first place. If it's connected it will only work 5% of the time. It'll say it's connected to the internet (so no yellow symbol) but it won't connect to any website or so.

What I tried to fix this:

* I updated the firmware on the router.
* Dell sent me an Intel wireless card to replace the Killer wireless card, because we suspected the card was just not playing nice with the router. The weird thing is it used to work for a whole year before this.
* I have got a new SSD in my XPS 15, so a fresh install of windows was also done.
* Updated to the newest Intel drivers.

I am really not sure what is happening here. It's the only device having issues on the network. Other networks also work fine. I got a new wireless card. I really can''t see how I am having issues.

I was hoping anyone here might have an idea. Thanks in advance!",0,1585593551,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frwg20/wireless_network_not_playing_nice_with_dell_xps/,techsupport,1

frw9xo,Mr_Meninist,Laptop Randomly Turning Off,"Hello All,

My laptop keeps randomly turning off and I was hoping to get some assistance with it. The computer will immediately turn back on when I press the power button, and when I type in my password, no files are lost/closed. This will happen between five and ten times a day. I'll be honest, I don't know a lot about computers, but I have done some research into the problem and wanted to confirm that what I was reading is correct. Thanks for the help!

General info: It is an ASUS laptop that is a little under three years old and runs window. It has an I7 processor and a nvidia graphics card. I have taken good care of the laptop It has never been dropped or anything and it mostly just sits on my desk for school work. The laptop has a loud fan that runs often. It was like that even when the computer was new.  the fan runs even when I'm not running large programs. I do not frequently run large programs on it anymore. I mostly use it for writing papers and doing online homework. (I was a biomedical engineering major and switched to neuroscience when I decided that I wanted to go to medical school.) I have been using the computer a lot more than usual now that classes are online. The issue has gotten a lot worse in the past few weeks because of this.

Most results from my search indicate that the laptop is overheating. They suggest that I clean the fan, buy a new fan, or buy a cooling mat. The computer does not get hot (to the touch) when I use it though. This makes me think that overheating may not be the issue. Do you guys have anything else I should look into. If you think this is the issue, I am happy to try to clean the fan or buy a new one, but I am recently out of a job due to coronavirus and don't have have the funds to replace the laptop if I somehow brake it. I will definitely be watching videos on it if I need to replace or clean the fan, but any added tips would be super helpful.

What do you guys suggest I do? I'd appreciate any help that you could give me. If you need anymore information, I'd be happy to provide it. Thank you!",6,1585593025,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frw9xo/laptop_randomly_turning_off/,techsupport,1

This error is not specific to the connected device, I have tried multiple devices and USB drives, all give this error. These devices work fine on other computers. I have attempted to follow these tutorials in hopes of a fix:

However, this tutorial did temporarily seem to fix the issue, only for it to come back within the next couple hours of using the device

CPU: i5 3330 @ 3.0 GHz
GPU: Nvidia GTX 970 
PSU: CoolerMaster B600

I recently got back to gaming with my PC and it first shut down unexpectedly when I was hosting A Way Out on Parsec. However, I have previously played many graphic intensive games such as Assassin’s Creed Origins, Ghost Recon: Wildlands, Hitman 2 etc. with no issues
Recently, I was also able to play Street Fighter V, Cities:Skylines, Rocket League for 2+ hours  also with no issues.

Now again, it shut down twice running Control for no more than 15 minutes. I have read that this could mostly be a power related issue, however my PSU seems to be running just fine even for prolonged periods of time (8-10hrs) (non-gaming). My graphic drivers are up-to-date and monitoring with MSI Afterburner I have set the temp limit to 76 degrees.

While playing A Way Out and Control, which is when the system shut down; I noticed the HDD getting excessively heated up but the PSU seems alright. I find no way to monitor these components temperature nor what is causing the shutdown. 

What do I need to do? Is it even safe to run again and conduct tests at this point?

So the first problem is when I put a working ssd in it, there's a  red light that isn't there usually no matter where I put the sata cable on the mobo.

The second or the same problem is that there's no video output no matter if I try integrated or the gpu's graphics. 

And the third problem is after a minute or so after I have the PC on, the fans slowly ramp up to insane levels and I have to plug it out because I'm afraid it's gonna explode or something...

So my guess is it's the motherboard or psu that needs replacing but I'd like to be sure. Also, should I just try waiting and seeing what happens?

How would I go about ensuring the PC has not been loaded (unintentionally or intentionally) with software like proprietary remote desktop that might have a backdoor? 

1) Can I backup all my drivers, then reset the PC, then reinstall the drivers?

2) Can I create a new admin user, delete the user they used to setup, then continue using the computer under the new admin?

Please disregard any notion of paranoia. I actually recently bought a new ssd that I'm trying to make my main system drive so doing this kind of ""resetting"" serves both purposes. 

The manufacturer's windows installation contains specific programs that come directly loaded (eg dolby home theatre among others) and once removed by re-installing windows, there's no way to get them back. How can I save these programs?

3) Can I create a system image backup, reinstall windows on the new ssd, then re-mount the system image? Would this ensure that those programs are restored?",0,1585590218,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frvdsa/how_to_reset_pc_after_receiving_from_tech_support/,techsupport,1

frurzm,thatsthesoundofthepo,Resolution/Refresh Rate not supported by PC anymore,"Hi. I'm running a 1080p 144hz LED monitor. My GPU (which is relatively new, got it a few months ago) only has HDMI ports and DP ports so I've been using a DP cable to achieve the full refresh rate.

About a month ago, I started having issues where I would boot my PC and it would struggle to detect the monitor (out of range, no signal etc.) sometimes. After restarting a few times, it would detect it but the monitor is locked out of its intended resolution and refresh rate. It is stuck displaying at 1280x720 and 60hz or lower. It is locked to these options both in Win10 settings and in the Nvidia control panel.

When I switch to an HDMI cable, it works fine, but is then locked at 60hz so I would prefer not to use that solution. Switching between my two DP ports on the GPU does not seem to make a difference. I thought it might have been my cable going bad, so I ordered a new one, and it worked, but only for a couple days. Now my PC has started doing the same thing with the new cable.

I've tried rolling back my drivers to an earlier version, as well as uninstalling them and doing a clean install of the newest version. The problem persists in both cases.

Since HDMI still works, I am not sure if the issue is the DP ports on my GPU or the DP port on my monitor. Unfortunately, I do not have another monitor that I can test the cable/GPU with. I tried doing some research online but could not find any promising leads. I am hoping to find some suggestions here on how to approach this problem.

frup01,Phaedrus_Wolf,Desktop has slower download speed on all networks.,"Hi! 

Today I realized that I have a consistent issue with my desktop that has appeared out of nowhere.

I moved to my parents recently because of college being shut down due to Covid19. I was excited to use my fathers fiber wifi, and found through internet speed test I am only getting 15mbps download.

This is odd as last time I was in town I brought my desktop and I had 200mbps then. He currently still has that same speed. 

With ethernet, 5g and 2g I get speeds of approximately 17mbps 15mbps and 14mbps.

Testing on other devices, his desktop get's \~200, my lap top get's \~200. and my phone get's 200.

So it is definitely an issue with my Desktop. I tried resetting my desktop multiple times, and the router once. and the issue has been consistent. To test whether it was an issue between my adapter and the router I tried internet speed test with my mobile hot spot. I got 7mbps on my desktop, and 60 on my laptop, so the issue has to do with my desktop.

I am not sure what could have caused this, I have ran malwarebytes and trend micro housecall incase it was a virus, and neither detected any malware/viruses.

If anyone knows the solution, or has any suggestions please let me know.

Here are some of my computer specs, starting with what is likely most pertinent, the adapter.

frulrw,lacuslekky,"I accidentally deleted a long passage from my Word document, and I can't undo it. Can anyone help??","So this might be difficult to explain, but I'll try my best. 

(sorry for the long post)

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I deleted a long passage from my word document so that I could print the remaining text (the deleted passage was not relevant to the text I was going to print, so I deleted it for the sake of printing the rest). 

I meant to recover the text I previously deleted by using the undo function in word or by pasting it in after I had printed the document (i had copied the deleted passage before I deleted it). 

But because my printer was out of ink, I had to browse the internet for new ink. But while I was doing so I completely forgot that I had copied the deleted passage from before and stupid me copied the name of the ink I needed and thus removing the copied passage from my clipboard (I'm on macOS Mojave 10.14.6 btw). 

By this time I had completely forgotten about the deleted passage which resulted in me saving and closing my document. I quickly realized my fault and reopened my document again, but I could no longer redo anything (the option is greyed out) and I no longer had the passage in my clipboard, so I couldn't paste it back either.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is: Can I somehow restore the previous version of the document (to before I deleted the passage)? Or is it possible to access the clipboard history and copy and paste the passage back in? 

I don't have Onedrive either so I can't restore it that way.

Since I've installed about 20 programs in this machine so far and none have asked me that, I don't really want to install something that's going to do something weird. It looks like maybe it's just being stupid (or extra polite) and asking me if I want to create the necessary folders for the app while other installers just do it without asking, but I can't be sure. Why would it bother to ask me if it needs to do it, anyway? It's really not an option if that's the case.

Can anyone confirm PowerPro's installer just wants to make the folders it needs and it's nothing that's going to cause me headaches later?

I use a TP-Link USB adapter, which has always worked until today. This morning I would have a minute or two of internet, then about 10 mins without, then a minute with internet, 10 without etc. etc. However now it has stopped working completely, refusing to load any web pages regardless of WiFi source. I tried my home WiFi and phone's mobile hotspot - it connected, but had no internet from either - but other devices worked fine with them.

I have rebooted the router and computer, and couldn't find any new drivers. My laptop and phone are using the same WiFi and work without a problem. I've tried a few troubleshooting articles and come up with nothing that works.

I installed a newer Windows a few days ago, but it was working fine up until today. The only change to my PC is quarantining a few things in MalwareBytes - could this have affected it?

Any help would be extremely appreciated, I have an assignment due tomorrow and need my PC to complete it.",1,1585586667,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fru9l2/wifi_gradually_stopped_working_in_windows_10_two/,techsupport,1
fru9ea,PrinceBel,NAT Type and Public Static IP?,"Hi Reddit,  
I recently bought a Nintendo Switch, only to find out that I am stuck with NAT type D/strict and have been trying everything to change it to type A/B/open.  The Switch has been given a static IP, tried enabling DMZ, port forwarding, and made sure than UPNP is enabled.  I'm still stuck with NAT type D.  


I got in touch with my ISP- I live in a rural area, so it's a small, local company- and they said that I would require a public static IP to have an open NAT which they can provide for a fee.  Now, I'm more than happy to pay the fee and have them provide me with the static public IP if this is what I need to do.  But in all the research I've done trying to figure out how to open my NAT, I haven't come across anything that says I need a static public IP.  


Can anyone shed some light on the situation??  Will this really enable me to get a NAT type B/A on my Switch?  Thanks!",0,1585586652,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fru9ea/nat_type_and_public_static_ip/,techsupport,1

Mobo ASUS B250M 
HDD 2TB Seagate

The issue is that my pc is CONSTANTLY blue screening and its getting worse. Previously it was just doing it every now and then but now its doing it on boot. It then reboots and gets stuck in a loop of auto repair doing nothing which then leads to another BSOD. This problem has got worse every time I have installed a specific game but I doubt that's the issue. I have done all the standard chkdsk stuff and even took it in for repairs. The guy at the repair shop said it was just an OS problem and couldn't see any major issues so I reinstalled my OS. The BSOD errors calmed down but were not gone. I recently reinstalled what I suspect to be the offending game and sure enough the BSOD on boot is back. Really lost and I don't want to take it back in for repairs unless I absolutely have to.

First one is that sometimes when someone makes a meeting for me in Microsoft Teams on my Calendar, it doesn't show up in Outlook until the next day.  The Teams add-on is enabled in Outlook, and I restarted the computer.  I did a test with another person and those meetings did show up instantly so I am not sure why I randomly had a couple that took a day to come through.  At this point could it have just been lag in the system or something?  Using Windows 10 Pro

&amp;#x200B;

The other issue is someone on my team says that their Windows Explorer keeps freezing, and they have to launch task manager and end the Windows Exploerer task in order to be able to use File Explorer again (it happens specficially when they are using file explorer).  I took a look at their computer and 72&amp; of the RAM was being used.  Could this be the cause of it?  The person did not have hardly any windows open, just a Google Chrome window, Outlook,  and Amazon music.  I have the same amount of RAM and have Google Chrome open  along with Outlook, and Word, and file explorer runs fine for me.  I am having them run a hardware scan (using a Dell laptop) and we both use Windows 10 pro.  Just wondering if I am missing anyting.  Could anything in the event logs tell me anything?

frtc71,Sennes_7,"Google Data Archive downloaded from my home IP address, but I did not request it.","Hi all,   
A week ago I received an e-mail from Google that ''I'' requested my Google Data archive, meaning the zip-files with all my photos, locations, browsing history, mails, and so on. 

The problem, I did not request it. I first checked if it was valid and no fishing attempt, and (unfortunately?) it was real. It was mentioned in my Google profile, which also showed the IP-address. The IP-adress is the same as my home, where I live with my boyfriend.

That evening the archive was requested, I was using my laptop now and then, but I am 100 % sure I did not request my data at that time. 

I only noticed the request and archive mails the next morning, as I was busy with working on a study deadline. Then I changed my passwords and installed 2-step security, and logged out on all devices, obviously. 

Still, it is making me feel paranoid someone might have downloaded my Google data archive, and therefore also access to my accounts. Strangest thing is that it was requested from my and my boyfriends IP-adress. I don't want to accuse my bf, but he has shown somewhat  controlling behavior and studied computer science, whereas I am a total tech-noob. 

My questions are:

* Is there any way I can check in the log-books of my laptop to check if someone accessed my computer at the time my data archive was requested?
* Is it possible for a hacker to acces my laptop from distance (and therefore using the same IP-address)? Or did it had to be someone physically present in the same room?

frtb2x,SmashPortal,"[Win7x64] Sound Issues (Freezing, Long Startup)","My current audio devices setup is as follows: I have speakers (Logitech S120), and I have headphones (Logitech G432). When I want to use the speakers, I disable the headphones. When I want to use the headphones, I re-enable them (set to default device).

For a couple months now, I've been having sound issues. At first, I only noticed Discord calls taking a long time to fully connect to, but then I started to have other issues--

- If I switch between audio devices while watching a YouTube video, it stops and buffers as though I were having internet issues.

- When I startup my computer, MS Security Essentials doesn't start right away (it takes about 10 minutes from my computer to fully start, then another 5 minutes for MSE to come online. When it does, I hear a Windows ding sound. During this time, if I open ""Sound"", none of my devices show up, so I think it's related).

- Just today, I tried switching from speakers to headphones at the end of a Zoom meeting (to talk to the professor), and Zoom froze for a good 30 seconds when I did it. When it unfroze, the meeting had ended. 

Additionally, -- and this has been happening for a really long time (a couple of years), but I assume it's related -- when I'm in a game like Overwatch or Rainbow Six: Siege, my mic will suddenly be disconnected from voice chat. In Overwatch, this looks like I'm still in the voice channel (but muted), but for everyone else, I left the voice channel and have to reconnect. In Siege, my mic icon just disappears from the scoreboard menu (leaving an empty space). In both scenarios, I can't vocalize to my team. I can't hear them either in Overwatch, but I'm not sure about Siege because I haven't been playing for as long (and it was rare at first).

Now, my belief is that whenever I switch devices, anything that's using the audio has a hard time updating to the new audio source. I'm sure there are other occasions when this happens, like on startup.

I've tried using Device Manager to remove the driver, then rebooting Windows to automatically reinstall. That seems to be the common recommendation. Some posts say that it's another program that's having trouble (with startup), but I don't think so based on the other symptoms. MSE says my PC is clean.

I've already googled about it but what really worries me is that the sound of my phone and earphones (redmi note 8 pro and mi sports earphones) only lag while gaming. The sound doesn't have any delay when I'm watching YouTube videos or listening to music. Is it normal or it should lag when I watch videos too?
Is there any solution?

frt24v,beater942,Even the low specs games lag and stutter on my gaming laptop.,"Guys i have had inspiron 15 7567 for around 4 years.i have always had a bit of stutters and lag on games i play like seige and pubg where i used to get around 50 fps and 30 fps on all settings set to the lowest as possible.it used to just work fine ,not very bad but it was bad.

6 months ago i downloaded csgo where i get under 60 fps in-game with all settings set to very low too but main menu getting 110 fps.even dota 2 i would get around 30 only with settings on lowest.

Remind you that i had all my drivers updated.

Few days back the issues had become worse I thought resetting my laptop would fix all the lags,stutters, fps.so i resetted yesterday and updated all the drivers and stuff but still my games like cs lags a lot getting around 35 fps on average.

The laptop gets heated a bit too much.i dont know if that would cause it


Please suggest and help me in any way you can possible to fix my laptop.
Thank you :)

frsxjw,Bobthedoodle,computer keeps blue screening. but i cant find the cause.,"this might be a bit long, OR I explain it horribly and might be able to clear things up later.

let me start with my use to never blue screen until about a year ago and it would blue screen every now and then and the error code i would always get was bad pool caller. but then it started getting more frequent and i never did anything about it until recently about 2 weeks ago when my PC BSOD 3 times in 2 hours. I did everything I could think of,

updated bios. lan drivers. USB drivers. updated graphics drivers. did a memtest. tested the ssd and hard drives for errors all clear. and i reinstalled bitdefender. also want to note that I have bitdefender premium and malwarebytes premium installed but i did a bit of research and found that they should be compatible before installing them both with some settings here and there changed. after doing all of that i didnt have a bluescreen for about 2-3 days. I thought it was fixed.

but there are sometimes (kinda rare.) where i would get BSOD but the screen wouldnt stay long enough for me to see the error code. like it just crashed. and I checked the Event viewer and it says ""The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."" event ID: 41 Kernal Power.

I am baffled at this point I have no idea what to do. Ive uninstalled and updated every troublesome program I can think of that I have on my PC. 

but Im also thinking this might either be a ram or power supply issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, because I have been battling this issue for a while.",4,1585582382,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frsxjw/computer_keeps_blue_screening_but_i_cant_find_the/,techsupport,1

Here is a TL;DR version of the problem:

The TV, ever since I first got it, has been slowly failing at picking up one specific freeview (for non Brits - free terrestrial channels) frequency that broadcasts some channels that I regularly watch (frequency 55 broadcast from COM7 in Crystal Palace, if that helps).

I'm 99.99% sure it is the TV itself, as when I plug my old one in the same spot, there is no issue (see [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TVRepair/comments/fqnw5b/uk_lg_43uk6400plf_tv_not_picking_up_one_specific/) for more detailed description and what I've tried).

I'm wanting to know if I can fix this myself by changing the part out, if I have no choice but to send it out for repair, or if it is a lost cause entirely.

Then when i switch back, the controls and mouse moves over, but the screen remains stuck on the surface, or at least the visual gets stuck on the screen because the surface wont allow access to it anymore. The mouse and keyboard moves over to the desktop pc but not the screen.

What could be causing this issue?

If i press the USB switch to move it to the surface, it moves the mouse/keyboard/screen over.

However, as soon as I plug in my headphones, the Realtek(R)-Audio-Driver overwrites the digital jack signal with my 3.5 mm jack signal (and there is no way to prioritize manually). Hence, it tries to get input from my headphones mic (which are quite bad: low voice volume, loud static noise).

I know, With the Realtek HD Audio Manager, there was the possibility to consider it as two different devices so that you could enable one as input and one as output. But, my laptop only has the Realtek Audio Console installed, which does not seem to have any useful settings at all.

frsa0x,AceHeartlight,GPU Usage drops while ingame,"Hey everyone ! My GPU usage drops dramaticaly when playing video games, causing huge freezes  and making theme unplayable and I am struggling to find the cause. I discovered it while running MSI Afterburner and displaying GPU usage during gameplay. The GPU usage goes from 98% to as low as 4% in a second, however the usage drops more frequently to 40ish%, enough to cause a massive freeze nonetheless. 

&amp;#x200B;

Oddly enough, the drops happen when \**something*\* happens in the game : when playing CoD for example, the drops occur when I shoot or when I get shot; when I turn my camera and do a 180; when I get out of a building etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my detailed specs with clock speeds, voltage and temps using HWMonitor (the screenshots were taken while the PC is idling, browsing Chrome) :

Here is the short version of my specs : My PC is a MSI Laptop, model GE63VR 7RF bought three years ago.

CPU : i7-7700k

GPU : GTX 1070 

RAM : 8 GB 

I am pretty sure it is not a case of bottlenecking, although it looks like it : The CPU usage remains pretty constant and does not hit 100% ingame.  

My NVIDIA drivers are updated. I mainly play CoD Warzone these days and the drops happen every game, while playing and in the menus. Tried rebooting twice, tried changing the power management mode in the NVIDIA control panel, tried running the game in fullscreen and windowed, tried changing the graphics settings from ultra to very low, and I am probably forgetting other things I tried. I haven't been able to resolve it and I am at loss of solutions. 

I am not particulary well informed on  this subject so I want to ask for your help. What could cause the GPU usage to drop ? Thanks ! :)",0,1585580236,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frsa0x/gpu_usage_drops_while_ingame/,techsupport,1

Recently my WiFi extender packed in so I fished out my old TP-Link AC450 Wireless Nano USB adapter (archer t1u) and started using it on my computer. However it is incredibly slow, it takes 5 minutes just to load the speed test webpage but when I run the speed test it’s normal (~5mb download/upload, yes I know this is super slow but WiFi around me is awful and we have the cheapest package with one of the worst providers). Do i need to buy a new USB adapter or is there another better way of getting my pc online? Ethernet straight to the router is not an option, I used Ethernet to a wifi extender for the past year but it was not that reliable.


Some possible issues:
The USB adapter is built for windows 8 and I have windows 10.
I also don’t have a cd drive in my pc so I downloaded the drivers and such onto a memory stick using my laptop and transferred them using that. 
The frequency of the USB adapter is 5GHz, I don’t know what my WiFi is or how to find out.

frs2oi,TeoTheBeast,Connection problems on my pc ever since moving locations,"So I moved my desktop from my dorm to my home due to the whole quarantine situation. Ever since I've been home, I've been having issues with connecting to wifi. Connection to my normal router doesn't work, but connecting to a hotspot on my phone doesn't work either. All other devices work perfectly fine on the same networks. I have a pcie network adapter (ASUS PCE-AC51) with the latest driver installed on my motherboard since ethernet is not an option.  Windows network diagostics has been giving me countless error messages, but no solutions seem to work. Here are the most common ones: 

\-Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding

\-The connection between your access point, router, or cable modem and the Internet is broken

\-The default gateway is not available

Sometimes it just says ""Can't connect to this network"", other times I'm able to connect but have no internet access. On some very rare occasions the Internet works for like half an hour but at ridiculously slow speeds (not over 300kb/s).

Here are some of the things I've already tried: 

\-reset all my internet settings countless times 

\-uninstall and install my network adapter again

\-manually set an IP-address and DNS server

\-deleted my temp files

\-flushing my DNS with ""ipconfig /flushdns""

\-resetting the TCP / IP stack with ""netsh int ip reset""

\-changing the wireless mode on my network adapter from auto to several options (IEEE 802.11b/g/n, IEEE 802.11a/n/ac...)

So, to start from the beginning. A few hours ago, my computer froze. Wasn't doing anynthing , just some light web browsing. No sweat, I push the restart button since nothing was responding. And now my computer goes on for a few seconds, then off, then on again. You get the idea.

I tried :

\-Unplugging completly the power supply before turning it on

\-Disconnecting the front panel buttons from the motherboard and turn the pc from the on button on the mobo, to no success

\-Made sure everything was clean and every cable connected

Hypothesis :

If it was a SSD or HDD issue, I would still get something on display

If it was a GPU issue, the pc would still turn itself

So either power supply failing, or motherboard, or ram , or cpu . And I hear no beep codes , and I had no BSOD, so i'm thinking PSU failure. 

Any suggestion ? thank you very much

Specs:

Windows 10 (whatever is the latest release)

i5 2500K 3,9 Ghz ( OC'd to 4,5 Ghz, maybe that's the cause)

8 GB DDR3

Nvidia MSI GTX 970

Have taken out battery on mobo and shorted the reset prongs - still nothing

Ethernet cable has no effect (maybe it needed an update? But no - still can’t get to BIOS)

Used 1 RAM stick in the 2nd slot still nothing.

frrwec,BK201-TheBlackReaper,I have an issue with my Wi-Fi card and it's driving me crazy,"Hello guys, I believe this is my first post on reddit, at least for many years. 

So I custom built a PC around November and my wireless adaptor is an Asus pce-ac51. At first I had very high ping and was getting kicked out of games, so I phoned Scan (the company I bought it from) and they sent a replacement for me, and then confirmed it was faulty. 

2 months down the line, I have been suffering with constant ping spikes and high latency, it isn't a very stable connection. I don't have the option to used cabled connection so that's out of the question, but here is where it gets interesting.

On my laptop, my iPad, my girlfriends laptop, her phone, my phone, we are all getting between 40-50 Mbps download speed in the same room as where my PC is. 
However, on my PC I am only getting 13 Mbps download and around 20 upload. (I've never known upload speed to be typically higher than download speed)

And for some strange reason, when I go to View network connections &gt; properties &gt; configure &gt; advanced the options that display there on my desktop aren't the same as the options that display there on my laptop. As I tried to mimic my laptops options since that is working fine. 

I can only manage a stable connection using 802.11a and the 5 other options I can't even get onto games for over 10 seconds, it kicks me out. 

Quick note, if I set the value to Auto I can achieve higher download speeds but I can't connect to any games, which is extremely unusual in my opinion. 

The router is a vodafone THG3000 with both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz. 
The network I can ""play"" with these high latency is the 5Ghz one with 802.11a, and 2.4Ghz one is the one I go on when I put auto to download at higher speeds, but cant play any game at all since it kicks me out.

I've tried a few things like DNS flush, re installing the cards driver, pulling it out and putting it back in to the motherboard. 

I am not the most knowledgeable person and I have hit the limit of what I know, I haven't managed to fix it so I am hoping I can get some valuable insight on here. 

If you need any more info please do say and I'll get back to you ASAP!

frrs6i,protorales,Samsung Galaxy S8 different kind of bootloop (unstoppable rebooting),"My Galaxy S8 has suddenly stuck in a bootloop (if you can even call it bootloop because the logo doesn't even start to animate, see the video) a while ago after I restarted it (as I usually do, weekly or biweekly) and I have tried to bring it to life by flashing it using latest stock Samsung firmware (files: AP, BL, CP and HOME\_CSC) and by disconnecting everything from the motherboard except the screen and power supply (either charger or the battery) and trying to turn it on, but unsuccessfully.

The bootloop cannot be stopped except by removing or draining the battery. When I reconnect the battery it doesn't start looping by itself anymore. Pressing the power button or connecting the charger will start the bootloop.

There are 2 'unusual' things I did to it which, in my opinion, could've brought it to this state:  
\- using old car charger while traveling and using GPS, for 2 x 4 hours (2 months before it died, restarted it many times afterwards without any problems)  
\- tried watching the green flashing light out of my Galaxy Watch Active (heart rate sensor light) using both front and rear camera and putting the watch close to the camera (I saw some strange patterns on the camera screen and I stopped doing it immediately). I did this one day before it died and the very next day when I tried to restart/reboot it, it has never turned on again.

I have also tried to 'reflow' the CPU using hairdryer for 2 minutes. Stupid idea, I know, but this gave me a couple of hours with Nvidia laptop GPU some years ago.

I don't mind the phone anymore, it is the data on it which I care for (mostly 2nd factor authentication codes).

It seems impossible to enter the recovery menu. Only 'download' mode can be entered.

frrlvy,Cushions,WiFi Connection -- Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

User is having an issue connecting to a TALKTALK router wifi.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Worked fine last week with the device

\- Internet went down over the weekend

\- Worked fine for an hour this morning, now cannot connect at all

&amp;#x200B;

When trying to connect to the router it says ""Could not connect to the network"". Checking the wlan-report you can find this:

&amp;#x200B;

 

8003 2020-03-30T09:24:44 

\[‒\]WLAN AutoConfig service has successfully disconnected from a wireless network. 

Reason: The network is disconnected by the driver.

&amp;#x200B;

and then since then you can no longer connect to the router for the following reason:

&amp;#x200B;

11006 2020-03-30T09:44:12 

\[‒\]Wireless security failed. 

Reason: Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time

Error: 0x0

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Have tried:-

&amp;#x200B;

\* Forgetting connection and trying again

\* Rebooting machine

\* Rebooting the router

\* Uninstalling the Wireless device and letting it install itself again

\* netsh int ip reset

\* netsh winsock reset

\* Connecting to another network (phone hotspot) - worked fine

\* Other devices connecting to the router fine

I am kinda at a loss of where to take this further. It always fails with that Dynamic key exchange timing out. Any help or ideas would be appreciated.",0,1585577902,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frrlvy/wifi_connection_dynamic_key_exchange_did_not/,techsupport,1

First, let me tell you what I did in the process of getting the pc to run again:

- checked in BIOS if the AHCI is enabled

- installed the most recent BIOS software

- unplugged the HDD and dvd drive

- connected the SSD to SATA3 0 slot

- downloaded the windows 10 installation media to an external 

- formatted the SSD and started the win10 installation via USB (external hdd)



I tried 4 times to install win 10 and get my pc back on track. Yesterday, I came the farthest: I had windows running and installed almost all current drivers but the usual freeze on desktop screen (no mouse icon/no keyboard response) came during the process of installing my graphics card.  After that, windows won‘t start, I only get a black screen after the mainboard/BIOS logo on start up.

I think the issue may has something to do with the graphics card in conjunction with the ssd? These freezes happen apparently when the pc switches to a higher resolution. 


My hardware:

Mainboard - Gigabyte GA-B85M-D3H

Graphics Card - Asus R9 270, 2GB GDDR5

Power Supply - be quiet! SYSTEM POWER 7 400W

My  PC has a random to chance to fail to boot. It appears to be getting  stuck on ""VGA"" on the motherboard lights inside.  This happens totally randomly on boots. I just get a  flashing underscore on the screen or the logo.

CTRL ALT DEL will not work. It requires full power down to get back into it.

I've tried a number of solutions including:

* BIOS updates
* Changing ram
* Changing PSU
* All new hard drives
* BIOS defaults
* Older BIOS's
* Ensuring boot order is correct

Something  is causing it to stick and not work. It's a dice roll every  boot if  its going to POST. Once we are into windows everything is smooth  as  silk - no issues.

It's just a  chance it won't boot - it may happen every day, or once a  week, or  twice a day, or three, or not. Totally completley random.

My dorm has been getting a new internet system, which is great bc it means that my Nintendo Switch has lost the ability to partake in online play. I identified the issue as a Error: 2618-0516, *""You are unable to complete the matchmaking process.""* which according to Nintendo's support website **indicates that my network is not optimal for peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, likely due to my network's NAT type**.  
Like most of the people running into this issue, I live in a dorm (CPS dorm at that so it's not just a college dorm issue), and my NAT type is D. I know that **I want at least NAT type B to run online play**. Which is all fine and dandy until I run into the distinct problem that I do not have direct access to my internet settings/router and I have been denied contact to our IT to fix the problem with them.  


I have tried a rather old 2018 fix of changing my DNS settings to google's [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and [8.8.4.4](https://8.8.4.4) but unfortunately that fix doesn't work anymore.  
All troubleshooting suggestions point into the direction of my router and my internet settings, like setting up a DMZ for my switch, enabling UPnP or opening the ports via Port Forwarding, which I am unable to do.  


I'm really just looking for someone to give me a fix I can attempt that doesn't require me downloading some shady software to alter my internet unless it's verified to be safe or for a bunch of people to tell me there's no hope without IT cooperating. If everything fails i'll have to admit defeat and buy a giga cube or something but I'd rather save what little money I have.

When I  got home an set up, everything worked fine for a few days, and then the 2nd monitor wouldn't turn on. The button on the displayport that retracts the locking hooks was busted so I used pliers to (as carefully as I could) pull the displayport out of the computer and bought a new cord.

The monitor led has a blue light when it first powers on, the backlight comes on and even says no video signal detected but then goes dark, and the blue light turns amber.

And if I try to connect in settings right when I boot the monitor up, settings will crash as soon as the monitor goes dark, and the amber light comes on.

This problem occured when I changed the power multi plug I did fine I waited for ps4 to compltly turn off and when I changed it and turned it back on the fan stopped working.
I teared the ps4 down to check if it was just stuck or something, cleaned it from the dust and rebuilt the ps4 and same problem I turn on the ps4 with the botom cover off and the fan is not spining, probably it is burnt or somethink .
Can someone tell me how to fix that fan or should I get a new one. (I live in a third party world country so getting a delivry from a site is either not possible or so late and I would like a faster option to use in this damn quarenteen.

frq5so,mybot10,Ongoing CPU issue (3 different CPU's tried),"My PC broke a couple of months ago and I wanted to get a cheap PC going because I've mainly only been using it at home for a little bit of work and some light gaming. I opted to buy some low budget parts and a refurbished CPU.
I had some issues with being sent the wrong motherboard which wasn't compatible with the CPU I ordered so I got a new motherboard which was compatible.

When I put all the parts together and start the PC the fans (GPU, PSU, Heat-sink and case fan) all spin for a a split second and then stop.. this is repeated. When I take out the CPU the fans spin and don't stop. When the CPU is in the motherboard and the other parts are taken out the heat-sink fan spins and stops again. I concluded there's an issue with the CPU I was sent (the PSU is fairly new).

I sent that CPU back and got another one, the same thing happened (both refurbished CPU's), one of the sellers actually sent me another CPU (3 CPU's tried in total) and I've had the exact same issue.

Either I've been extreemly unlucky or something I'm missing.. I'm going to spend a little bit more money on another CPU but I wanted to be 100% sure this is where the issue is.

I've read through the forums, the PC is set up correctly all the right things in the right places, the PSU was working fine on the old PC and is fairly new. I tried launching without the GPU in, same without the RAM in, and if the CPU is in the motherboard the fans spin for half a second, if the CPU isn't in then the fans spin fine and don't stop.

frq5e0,noblight7,"Multiple BSOD issues, cannot reinstall windows.","So, basically its as the title says.. 
My specs are:
Cpu: i7-7700k 
Mobo: msi z270 pro gaming carbon
Gpu: sapphire nitro+ 5700xt 
Ram: hyper x 16gb (2x8gb) 

I recently came into a problem with my gpu first. The fans were spinning at full capacity constantly, so I turned off the pc, i removed the gpu and then reseated it, i also changed the fans around because the trixx software was telling me the gpu was failing the last fan check, and was not going above 0rpm. However, the fan when i looked at it was spinning just as well as the rest. Doong this and using ddu to wipe the drivers and reinstall fixed the problem with the fans going full speed, but now in the radeon software they only read the fans as goong up to 29rpm. Hmmm.. set custom fan curve, played assassins creed and the fans DEFINITELY were going, but still not saying above 29rpm. 

After playing assassins creed the pc would crash. I could play the game for 5 hours but once i closed the game, pc crash. Either a hard shut down or jard reset. Not sure what thats about. Put a ticket in the rma the gpu today. Same day i did this, i was just on chrome and nothing else, it crashes to blue screen. Annoying, but okay, I reluctantly install windows again. Now the fun begins. It starts of as a boot loop, cannot repair the pc. I get different error each time. One error is h:\Recovery\windowsRE\winre.wim\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt, another error 0xc0000221. Damnit. Try to reinstall windows again, installs properly, so I thought. BSOD SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. restarts, bsod: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED, again ATTEMPTED TO WRITE READ ONLY MEMORY. UNEXPECTED KERNAL MODE TRAP. This is not the full list. I have never seen so many in all my life. I removed the gpu, try to install windows again, same thing. On repeat. I do a memtest86, in the first 38 seconds i have 2000 errors. Okay, I stopped it early and am currently doing one ram stick at a time. The first was fine, the second seems to be doing okay as well. I plan to re do the memtest in full with them both in over night so I dont have to watch it and cry. 

I cant install windows. When it goes to the restart point of installation, it just loop reboots and if i leave the usb in it just boots back to the first installation phase. I have tried to reinstall it over 10 times. And nothing works. I install without the gpu, same issue. 

At this point, I think its best to just buy new parts. I think my cpu is okay, but im not sure about the ssd or the motherboard. I think both of them are not functioning correctly. Im going to take the gpu and try it on my brothers computer tomorrow, if it has the same fan issues then I will send back once I hear back from the rma ticket. 

I would like to not have to buy a whole new ssd but it is old, over 5 years. Before this i checked about two days ago for smart disk errors and it was completely fine and functioning. Now however, im not sure if its best to just go buy a full new motherboard and ssd or just a motherboard. 

My main question is would it be worth it to keep the processor and/or ssd just get a new motherboard, im just worried if the processor  and ssd is also not good. But i dont know how to check it. My instinct tells me to just buy new everything. But that is not a cheap endeavour.

frq4ce,TacitMantra,Motherboard not posting - possible corrosion due to suspected bad storage,"A friend of mine passed an old MSI  Z77A-GD55 motherboard and 3770k to me to try and build a system out of old parts for another friends of ours.

I gave it a clean down, put the essential parts together but it won't post. It just power cycles and doesn't get an image.

I've given it a thorough scan with a magnifying glass. It looked like it was maybe stored in a damp garage, possibly near some sort of solvent of grease. Some of the solder points on the back look like either some sort of fluid has started to erode the solder and drip down, hence some of the lines you can see in the photo. It's either that or tiny bugs have been dragging moisture across the board.

[https://imgur.com/a/p1AV9eg](https://imgur.com/a/p1AV9eg)

 I flushed out the slots and cavities with contact cleaner, blasted any remaining fluid off with a blower then used isopropyl to rub some spots that looked gunky.

Still no luck getting it working. I'm not sure if this is actual corrosion or just surface coating. It could also be a dead CPU. I'll be getting another 3770k in the near future to further test with.

Has any dealt with anything like this before?

frpufn,sassyennefer,NVIDIA Geforce 1050 code 45,"Hey guys so I have an Acer Nitro 5 (Nitro AN515-51) for about 2 years now. Recently I experienced a blue screen when booting up and afterwards, I realized that all my games had a significant fps drop. I went to the device manager and realized that under display adaptors, my laptop was now running Intel(R) HD Graphics 630 instead of the NVIDIA one, which only appeared when I clicked 'show hidden devices'. Turns out the NVIDIA driver had a Code 45 problem and said that the driver was not connected properly. I tried all kinds of solutions like running the troubleshooter, system file checker, CHKDSK etc. but none worked. 

I finally decided to uninstall the driver as I read online that it would automatically install again if I clicked 'scan for hardware changes'. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I tried to download manually from the NVIDIA website as well but when I tried to install the driver, it said 'The NVIDIA graphics driver is not compatible with this version of Windows. This graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware.' So now the NVIDIA driver doesn't even appear on the device manager at all. I'm really lost right now so any help would be really appreciated!

Additional info: I used a GeForce GTX 1050 and my OS is Windows 10 64-bit. I didn't uninstall the driver with DDU so maybe that's a problem? I think I may have updated the OS before the blue screen but I'm not too sure on that.

frpuc3,Raizo101,External Microphone Gone Wrong,"Hi everyone.

I recently bought a **Boya BY-M1** microphone as well as a **3.5mm jack to USB-C** adapter to plug it into my **OnePlus 7 Pro**.

However, when I do so, the phone believes that I've plugged in a headset, which makes everything go south. If I try using the voice recorder app it does not pick up any sound. If I try playing sound (e.g. Spotify) you can't hear anything at all.

I have a similar thing going on with my computer, a **Dell XPS 15** . If I plug it with the USB-C adapter, the same thing happens: it detects a headset but nothing works. If I plug it with the 3.5mm jack directly, it ""hijacks"" the default mic on my computer (i.e. no new microphone option appears on the sound manager).

Does anyone have any idea of what's going on?

frpq0p,Mazzbags,Static electricity disconnecting mouse and keyboard.,"Alright I'm all out of ideas and I need some input from experts lol. My new PC, if I even have a light static charge from moving around my couch and I reach forward and touch the mouse (sometimes keyboard too) on the coffee table, it will disconnect and reconnect.  I don't even have to feel the static shock for it to happen, so even a very light charge triggers the problem. I am static shocking the mouse and it is disconnecting and reconnecting it instantly. If I hook up my other PC, or my girlfriends PC to the same set-up, same mouse+kb, even a hard zap on the mouse will not disconnect it. If I connect a different mouse+kb to the problem PC, I get the same results.  Front ports on the case, back ports on the motherboard, doesn't matter, the issue is the same.  This is especially annoying because sometimes it will disable my dpi and RGB settings on the mouse.  It's a living room PC so quite often I will be playing a game on the couch with a controller, lean forward to alt+tab or whatever, watching youtube, etc. And this annoying problem occurs.  Probably 1/5 times I touch the mouse.  Outlet is grounded so thats def not the issue, and the problem occurs on other outlets as well.  I had my old rig hooked up to this same setup for years and never experienced this issue.  PC is sitting on hardwood.

I thought maybe it was the motherboard, so I RMA'd the motherboard and replaced the ram, same issue. Could it be the case? The power supply? Maybe this particular line of motherboards is really sensitive? (Asus x570). Those are the only 3 options left but I'd appreciate any input because I've been tearing my hair out with this one.  Again, I have two other PC's in the house and I can rub my feet on the carpet and give the same mouse a good jolt when hooked up to those machines, and it doesn't flinch.  With this new machine, even the slightest charge (even if I don't feel it) will disconnect and reconnect the mouse and/or keyboard, tried multiple mice and multiple keyboards.  Any ideas?

Is this phenomenon ghosting? Is there anything I can do to reduce this? I don't understand why I'm experiencing this on a $2000 laptop when my previous one that cost half the price didn't have this problem.

froqcm,IGilb23,PC freezing up/stuttering when playing games,"OS : Windows 10

Applications Affected : so far all pc games and also Adobe products (anything that uses GPU??)

Specs : AMD RYZEN 5 3600

ASUS TUF B450-M PLUS GAMING

ASUS STRIX GTX 980

CRUCIAL BALLISTIX GAMING RGB 16GB (2X8GB)

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all, first-time poster so please let me know if I got anything wrong,

So to the problem, 

Whenever I am playing any sort of game (this is most annoying in CS:GO &amp; Minecraft) my game will freeze up and stutter. This seems to coincide with GPU memory and GPU usage plummeting for a couple of seconds in a 3D Mark test whilst cross-checking with ASUS GPU TWEAK II. 

This is a fresh install of windows 10 and I have updated all drivers I can find, done all windows updates and turned game mode and game bar off. 

This happens in single-player games (non-internet) as well as multiplayer games. My TeamSpeak client (when playing with friends) does not lag when this happens either so I know it is not an internet issue.

The MOBO, RAM, and CPU are all new in this system so my best guess is a dying GPU, however, I thought I'd ask the smart people of Reddit what they think before splashing the cash.

Link to graphs from 3d Mark and GPU Tweak showing plummets in usage:

froq5d,sthsyd,Laptop charger seems to be defective,"This problem occurs every time I plug the charger's cable to a socket.

This problem occurs just about with every socket in my house. I'm sure this is a hardware problem.

It has been this way for about 3 days. All I remember, (before this problem occurred) is that I installed a setup file / media creation tool on my laptop to upgrade to Windows 10. But I didn't run the setup because the charger was already starting to be defective, started blinking and wouldn't charge the laptop. So, I decided to just shut down the laptop since the installation wouldn't really work properly. 

Just to let you know, my laptop only starts up and runs property if a charger is plugged into it. 

To add further information, my dad used to remove the laptop's battery and plug in the charger causing what he calls, ""infinite battery life."" He would use this technique every time he would use it. We share this laptop as a whole family by the way. We've been using it for a whole 7 years now.

The problem is that the charger has a green LED on the front of the power brick. Usually if it's plugged in, it would just stay green and wouldn't blink like how it is now. It would blink every two seconds.

I haven't had the chance to look up my laptop's specs and judging by the situation I'm currently in, I'm never gonna know. My laptop runs Windows 8. But I remember that it runs an Intel Core i5 if that's gonna help. My laptop is a Samsung Notebook NP350V5C-A02AE. Perhaps you guys could just search up the model's specs. I haven't installed any hardware ever since I've been using it. But it seems the problem here is the charger, not the laptop.

The charger that I'm using is an AC adapter made by a company named Delta Electronics, Inc. 

I have no further information on the charger itself, to be honest.

I've tried plugging the charger in every socket in my house. I haven't tried disassembling it or fixing the hardware since I'm no expert in that type of field. Yet, the charger's cable is intact and not broken.

Due to the long use of the charger, it may just have gave up and became defective. The laptop's battery might've also been defective. I'm planning to buy a new one but I'm just looking if this could be fixed.

Hopefully, you guys could help.",6,1585566175,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/froq5d/laptop_charger_seems_to_be_defective/,techsupport,1

I'm(M26) a proud owner of a *Conker's Bad Fur Day* cartridge and I always loved these old Rare classics. Unfortunately, I accidentally bought a *Conker's Bad Fur Day* copy which does not fit my N64. By closer inspection I discovered that the reason was rather simple: my cartridge was NTSC, but as a German I own a PAL N64.

I got this copy for a pretty juicy price tag and more annoyingly I did not check the compability right away. I bought it actually years ago, but I was busy playing other games and now I was surprised by this unpleasant problem. I don't even remember where I got it, so there are no refunds. I just want to make this cartridge work somehow. In one of Nitro Rad's videos (awesome channel by the way) I saw how he unscrewed one cartridge and put the circuit or how it is called into another cartridge to bypass the region lock. As I'm informed, the region lock is mainly or entirely by cartridge design. 

I would like to know, if Nitro Rad's idea works. I have here quite some rubbish games I don't mind losing, but I really would like to invulge some *Conker,* because it is one of my favourite games. If not, is their some other way to make it work? I fear, in the worst case, there is some digital blockade which cannot be avoided by simply cobble two cartridges together.

fro86p,Garkenful,About installing a 32-bits driver for a 64-bits PC,"Good morning, everyone

The point of this thread, is about what I implied in the title, obviously. Recently, I have decided to install an updated driver for my graphics card (Intel HD Graphics); take in count that I've never took the time to update my graphics card on this PC, this was my first time doing it in here.

When the installation of the driver finished, I've noticed an annoying issue with the driver more later, specifically when playing videogames, and I took the decision of reverting all the changes I did. Overall, it was a bad idea to update that thing.

I thought that reverting drivers was kind of easy, but it seems to be that not... or at least in my case; the CD of the drivers that came with the PC was uncompatible for some reason, and after knowing that, I went to the Intel support website, and installed, and uninstalled, lots of drivers for my graphics card, with the hopes that one of them could get rid of that annoying issue that has been occuring me since I've updated it, and no, nothing worked.

After doing a lot of research, and experimenting with some things, I've discovered that I can't install my ""default graphics card driver"", because only supports x32 systems, and I have a x64 one, so my question is, it is possible to me to install a driver like that, whether I need to format my PC, or not? More specifically; maybe I could do something if I format my PC to a 32-bits system, install the driver, and then, format my system back to a x64 one again? Or simply there is nothing to do?

And yeah, I've tried looking for x64 versions of the driver, but there aren't. It's a really old driver (2013), so yeah.

So I have this camera, Sony PXW-FS5, which has an ethernet port and is apparently able to directly stream video via an ethernet cable to my computer (iMac).

And although the camera itself says it is streaming, I don’t know how to access the stream on my Mac and am even doubtful if there is any signal coming through at all. I am pretty sure that I fucked up some the Network setting, because I have no idea how any of this works. 

 How do I go about this? How do I access the video signal that is coming in via LAN on my computer? What IP-Adresses do I need to give to the camera and to the Network? How do I use Ports? What is a Subnetmask, what do I need and use it for?

I checked all the connections, no problems there. It seemed simple enough, the button is broken, I have to replace it...

Hi All

1st reddit post, emotional.

I need some assistance upgrading my 3 or 4 year old PC! This is new to me, I was just going to pay someone to sort this but given the extra time on our hands it seems like a good isolation project!

Below are the specs of my current set up, obviously pretty out of date. What I'd like to achieve is 144fps and confidence that it'll be able to run the majority of games at top settings for a good while. However, I'm happy settling for 1080p in order to obtain this and keep the cost reasonable.

So can anyone suggest the most effective upgrades on a (max) budget of roughly £1,200, excluding an appropriate monitor which I'll sort myself separately. I was looking at just upgrading to say a RTX2070 graphics card but what I don't fully understand yet is if the other components can support that like my CPU and things.

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!

Then it said your password was changed an hour ago...

The main issue I'm having is I set up the Facebook account around 11/12 years ago on an email account I set up in 2004 and has not been signed into for nearly a decade. (I can't remember any passwords etc.) 

Trying to login on outlook to no avail then  requested an account recovery for my old email address used on the Facebook account, it told me I'd reached my limit of recovery requests for that day please try again 24hrs, I only did 1 request. Are other people yet ying to access my emails too?

Also if I press forgot password it says I have a le******@getnada.com attached to my account I can send a code. But I don't know what that email is, never heard or used Getnada before and. I'm unsure why it's showing up on an old email address.

frnn1s,Trustedflipper8,"CenturyLink C1000Z Modem/Router in ""Walled Garden"" status after reboot","Hello all,
Fellow IT Prof. Here asking for a bit of help. So I recently changed the security settings on my router since I will probably be doing remote work from home via VPN. I need the PPP password from my ISP but instead of dealing with teir 1 tech support that will put me on hold I decided to do my own troubleshooting. 

1. Downloaded my prior configuration file from the GUI and opened it with notepad and looked for the &lt;PPP password&gt; section of the script. 

2. Attempted to use PuTTY to try and edit my settings to obtain the PPP password via CLI. 

I am a bit stuck in what to do now, I am using DSL and the line is live but the internet is not accessible the modem is not in my name so if I call the ISP I will most likely get pushback since I am not the owner of the equipment (but I am the admin) 

So what should I do ? Does this  have anything to do with the Army using CenturyLink for Covid-19 purposes ? I looked at down detector the other day and my state was hit hard with an outage so the question is do I need the PPP or is it just an outage I have to wait out ? Or maybe it's a bill that went unpaid by accident ? 

I don't have time to call some dopey ass 19 year old in tier 1 I have some serious work to do with my own IT problems for a LOT of people and I'm sure you do too. what can I do to solve this. I recently factory reset the router and still get the same problem. 

Not trying to be a dick but my work schedule is so time sensitive at the moment it's not even funny if I'm down people are screwed.

Much love to all my IT peeps out there dealing with this insanity right now.",0,1585560542,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frnn1s/centurylink_c1000z_modemrouter_in_walled_garden/,techsupport,1

Let's start off by saying I own the questionably legitimate accidental DRM free DOOM, but since it's technically not ""cracked"", it shouldn't be a problem, right? Computer shouldn't be either since it's fresh out the store: ASUS TUF Gaming FX505DU-AL420T gamer laptop (15,6'' FHD/Ryzen5/8GB/512 GB SSD/GTX1660Ti 6GB/Win10H)

First day it got home, I tried playing, doesn't work uof course. I check task manager, it starts, but immediately crashes, don't even get a black screen or anything.

Then I check online about the fixes: my laptop's plugged in, I set everything to high performance, I updated all drivers, even the BIOS, it's using the 1660 Ti, but nothing.

Then I read that if I disable the integrated GPU (AMD Radeon Vega 8), it should work, because then it runs solely on my stronger GPU. And it starts… with 3 fps.

At this point I'm randomly switching the int. GPU on and off, and restarting the laptop, and suddenly, after a restart, when I turn the GPU back on, it works. I'm on ultra with 100+ fps, and I play until I'm too tired (I managed this at like 10 pm).

Next day, I start the game, it loads and everything, but as soon as I try to enter the campaign, it crashes. Starting a new game doesn't work either, lowering the graphics doesn't work. And it keeps doing this.

I again start messing with the int. GPU, and now I'm back to square one, except I now get a black screen before the game crashes.",5,1585559585,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frngyg/doom_eternal_laptop_problem/,techsupport,1

I have an i9-9900k and GTX 1080 with 48 gb of ram running Windows 10 and for several months now my computer has been having these microstutters of sorts.

I type something (like in this text window) and when pressing a key it appears to not register the key press but then does afterwards,

I watch Netflix and the screen stutters.

One common denominator through all of these is that they seem to occur whenever ""video encode"" in Windows task manager temporarily (at the same time as the stutter) goes to 0% from a normal 6%, but I already have fresh drivers installed.

All of these freezes or stutters are very short, probably 0.25 sceonds long at most, but very annoying. What should I do to remedy this?

The error messages are usually IRQL not less or equal. Sometimes it's failure to write to read only memory.  Sometimes it's some Kernal error.

I have replaced the ram, tried to repair and reinstall windows, removed the SSD and HDD and loaded a portable OS from a USB. It always ends up in it crashing or shutting down within a few minutes.

Before I removed windows, if it was 100% cooled down, I could get windows to load for maybe two minutes. The portable USB OS stayed on for a few minutes longer. The longer it has been on, the more likely it is to get caught in a restart loop and not even get to any OS loading screen.

All fans are operating, I added more thermal paste to the CPU and GPU and it did nothing.

frmthw,dalesahadow02,"My computer randomly restarts but NOT when I play certain games, except for Paradox games (Stelaris/CK2/HOI4/ETC.) Wtf is going on?","Bit of backstory, I built this thing like 5 months ago. At first it worked pretty well. It's my first build so I expected something to go wrong but the thing worked. A week later, I wake up in the morning and tried turning it on but it refused to. At first I assumed I fucked up and I broke/incorrectly installed something. After some testing of parts excluding the motherboard in my roommates's build, all of the parts worked without anything going wrong, so I sent the thing to a PC repair place. I get it back (according to them it was because I installed the operating system on my D: drive \[my hybrid hard drive\] instead of my C: drive) and it worked once again.

Couple days later, the things stops working again. I don't even bother testing and just send to a different PC repair place. Turns out a loose screw shorted the motherboard and I had to buy a replacement. Got it back and it worked well for about an hour. Then it restarted without warning. For the first week I had to just use the thing because I couldn't afford another visit to a PC repair place. I discovered that in that week that it doesn't restart if I have certain games open. I initially used Dragonball Fighterz but also discovered that Escape From Tarkov also keeps my computer from restarting and uses up less CPU. I used my computer for a couple months now and my friends wanted to play Stellaris over the weekend and, since I was the only one who had all the DLC, I had to host. A couple hours in my computer started restarting again.

At first I thought it might have been a temperature issue but a bit of testing showed that I was at \~60-\~70C when I randomly restart. I'm really confused on why this is happening and I wanted to post my issue here before I go to another local PC repair place to see if I can resolve it without paying too much

I was planning to use the pc as a mobile platform and also with a docking station and dual external monitors (with laptop lid closed). Whenever I use the laptop by itself for my everyday tasks, the laptop is pretty quiet. But when I do those same tasks when hooked to the dock, the laptop heats up a LOT, and the fan is very loud, sometimes overpowering its wimpy little speakers. I've worked with the dell warranty team for weeks at this point. Here's what we've tried

1. they sent me a replacement refurb laptop, which had the same issue
2. i brought home my work computer (xps 15), same issue
3. i plugged the laptop in using the power adapter (not TB3 usb-c), and used a single external monitor via hdmi, same issue
4. dell support had me try to reset the ""group policy,"" which exists on both the new laptop i bought and the replacement i got, and replace them with an OEM dell policy. supposedly, that's the next step in the troubleshooting process.

There's also been a couple of times where I've been actively using the pc and its restarted randomly(like what just happened now reminding me to make this post). I've already tried googling how to stop this, and what I remembering doing is not allowing windows to automatically update(I've also had some problems trying to manually update it fyi where it can never finish the install past 10-20%). I've also turned on a setting to stop restarts in the case of an error to first tell me what the error is before restarting, never once have I seen this screen or just always goes straight to the blue restarting screen with the loading circle.

frmgoj,sfish18,PC blackout issues with unoptimized games,"I have been having this issue for quite some time now, some time mid-2019. Here are the specs of my PC:

&gt;Ryzen 5 2600

&gt;16 GB RAM

&gt;Galax RTX 2060 White Mini GDDR6 6GB

&gt; Running as far as I know, the latest Windows 10 update

I don't play much games these days but when I do I can say that my PC can play heavy, graphically and/or CPU-demanding games just fine. I've played the new Call of Duty: Warzone, Witcher 3, Jedi: Fallen Order, DOTA 2, Dota Underlords, etc. I even ran Heaven Benchmark just fine, all the way from the start to the end. Here are the results from that:
&gt; https://imgur.com/a/fLa0Orc

Now the issue lies when I launch, or play less, what I assume is less than optimized games, and this list of games include small games such as:
&gt; We Were Here, Pool Nation, Football Manager 2020, Overcooked 1, Overcooked 2

It also happens in some big games, but I can kind of attribute as to the reason for these games:
&gt; Dota 2 (Only at random times, known for various optimization issues here and there), Divinity Original Sin 2 (Only the last act, in which googling shows me that a lot of people have performance issues in the new final area of that game)

Again, this is only my assumption, that these only occurs in unoptimized games, but the issue exactly with what happens is: 

I would launch the game, and in some cases such as Pool Nation, and Overcooked 1 &amp; 2, at the main menu, both my monitor screens would black out, sometimes I can still hear audio and Discord audio, and the computer does not restart, just blacks out. The fan on the PC speeds up to the max speed, in which I am not sure which fan it is, but I think it is the GPU fan. And if I leave it be, it would just stay in this state until I force shutdown by holding down power button. 
I suspected that it may be a power issue, so I've switched PSU to an older one, and the same thing still happens. I've stressed test both my CPU and GPU with no issues. I've checked disked both my C: and D: drives, and I've done a memory test on my RAMs. 

At this point, I think it is something wrong with my GPU, as some random times browsing, watching YouTube or Twitch, Windows would show an error of ""Display Driver failed to start.""

So can anyone tell me what's the issue here? Why can my GPU run big games just fine until it tries to run smaller games or less optimized games? What should I do here?",0,1585553881,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frmgoj/pc_blackout_issues_with_unoptimized_games/,techsupport,1

frmat1,xT28arakanX,"Logitech mouse, keyboard &amp; headset upgrade","I don't know if this post is related to this subreddit, but I think you guys are more experienced than me at this. **Keep in mind I can only one buy thing, so I want to know which is the best option for me.**

&amp;#x200B;

**KEYBOARD UPGRADE**

Somewhere around January 2019, I bought the Logitech G213 Prodigy. The minimalistic design of it, the mechanical feel and the special keys (mute, sound leveling and anti-windows keys) made me fall in love with it. Even after playing intense osu!mania maps, I had zero problems, except one: it has an English layout.

This is an annoyance to me, because everytime I need to write something in Spanish, I have to change the system's input language (ENG to ESP). This caused a little bit of confusion at first, because when I pressed ***"";""*****,** it showed up as an ***""ñ"".*** I got used to it, but I would like to stop changing the input language everyime (Windows key + Space). I also plan to give it a wayI also don't know what I should do with it if I upgrade.

The problem that has been explained above led me to think if I should upgrade and buy the Logitech G513 Carbon. Same minimalistic design, real mechanical feel, lightsync and a removable wrist rest (but no special keys, sadly).

I also need to mention that my country doesn't have the best economy, so I bought the G213 for $80 (it was like $60 on USA), and as of right now, the G513 is $160 (I think it's $100). I can buy it, but is it worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

**HEADSET UPGRADE**

I bought the Logitech G231 Prodigy for $40 four years ago, and it's the best headset I ever bought. It covers up all of my ears (can someone tell me the name of this type of headset?), and it feels more comfortable than any other headset I've used in the past.

The only problem is that the device that controls both microphone and volume levels is a little bit broken. Basically, if I touch it, I will only hear sound from one speaker (left or right), so I have to touch it again until I can manage to hear audio from both speakers again. I don't really know what happened to it, because I never threw this headset (I believe it has only fallen twice, but the speakers work with no problems). It's an annoyance that I'm also accustomed

Knowing this issue, I'm planning to buy the Logitech G432. I like it's colours, and considering the controlling device is no longer attached to the cable, it would solve this problem for me.

I need to add this as well: I bought the Logitech G231 for $60, and as of right now, the G432 is $135 (I don't know how much is it in the USA). Considering that this upgrade will solve my issue, is it worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

**MOUSE UPGRADE**

I'm not really sure about this, but I don't know if I should upgrade or not. Basically, I bought the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum for $48 like five years ago. It gave me zero problems, excluding the double-click issue which is very rare. But, I have encountered external little issues, which I do not consider them to be a part of the mouse's problem (at all):

\- A lot of dust always concentrates in one place, and despite my efforts of cleaning both my table and the mouse's base, it doesn't go away. It's always in the same spot, and I don't know if buying a mouse pad will fix this.

\- My cable, a snakeskin type one, gets hard as a rock. I don't know what's the science behind this, but I can't manipulate it like a normal cable. Due to this, it adopted a shape and I can't change it back. I've seen some guys peel the mouse's cable, but I'm afraid I'll fuck up something so I'm not trying that. Any way to solve this?

Anyways, I've seen the new Logitech G502 Hero and Lightspeed version. Their shapes are a little different, almost unnoticeable, the actualized ***G*** logo, a meshed cable (thank god), a ten times better sensor as I've heard, and useless 16000 DPI. However, the Lightspeed version is wireless (and it can be used with cable too).

Right now, the Hero version is at $87, while the Lightspeed version is at $140. This is the latest of my priorities, so I'm not planning to buy one of this any time soon. Still, I want to know if the upgrade would be worth it.

frm4i2,ddg2112,Frequent driver_power_state_failure on AMD Radeon 530 (Laptop GPU),"So, 2 days back my laptop, **Lenovo Ideapad 330 (15IKB-81DE)** does a BSOD with the error code of **driver\_power\_state\_failure** after updating my AMD drivers to **Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.3.1 Optional** through the Radeon software, during the installation process. I thought that this was just a minor thing and nothing to worry about but after the restart when I tried to play CS: GO, I noticed that I'm not getting the FPS I used to get normally.

I opened task manager to see if any other processes were taking my resources and what do I see, my AMD GPU is missing and I'm running on the integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics. When I opened the Device manager to see if my GPU was missing, it was missing. So, I then enabled show hidden devices, the GPU was present in hidden devices but had the following error - **Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45). To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer.**

I tried restarting, did a clean install of Windows 10 (1909), created through the Media Creation Tool, after formatting the boot drive, installed generic drivers from Lenovo support, installed the **Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.2.2 Recommended (WHQL)** drivers but to no avail.

My laptop was only opened once and that was about a year ago to change the keyboard and was running fine until this happened.

Please help me solve this problem as this is getting in the way of my work and my gaming.",0,1585552032,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frm4i2/frequent_driver_power_state_failure_on_amd_radeon/,techsupport,1
frm4hj,GenericOwOUsername,Stuck in boot loop and resetting gets stuck.,"I recently was going through storage and found my Hp 15 Notebook Pc and am trying to reset it to see if it still works at all. It turns on, takes charge. When it does turn on, it brings up the Hp logo and than blackscreen, and restarts. The orange wifi symbol turns white and than when the laptop reboots, it turns orange which makes me think the laptop is still on but I do not know. I've looked for hours on what to do. All of the tests in the f2 menu come back as passed, switched from Legacy to UEFI and restarted- nothing, so I set it back to Legacy. There is no detachable battery (but two sliders on the bottom). I've tried resetting it but the first time it was stuck at 54% and the time(s) after that it's been stuck at 37%. Everything I've tried does not work. Factory reset, hard reset, holding power button for 15 seconds and retrying. I don't have another computer that runs windows so I can't put a new windows installer on a usb and port it into the Laptop. Any help at all will be appreciated. Also, everything I looked up was never specifically for the Hp 15 Notebook pc so maybe there's a specific process I'm yet to try. As for now, I'm going to let the reset sit over night just incase it makes progress and if that doesn't work, I'll let the battery drain and than restart it. (Extra Side note, when I got it out of storage, it turned on and signed into my account fine. I am trying to reset it to give it to my nephew.)

frm1y5,Zombalias,Certain keys on my laptop are behaving strangely,"So, last week out of nowhere my laptop's keys started acting up.

all of the lower letter keys (z-m), my punctuation keys (;-/) and my ""q"" key have been only sometimes (like 20% of the time) been responding to my pressing them.

What's really weird to me though is that if I \*hold\* one of the problematic keys it \*does\* eventually respond albeit very delayed (abt 3-6 sec). The proper character is typed, there's a slight pause, and then that character auto-repeats until I take my finger off the key, like normal.

I've owned it for two years and never had a problem like this.

No one else but me even approaches this laptop, I've never spilled anything on it, I don't even eat near it, it's the only computer I own and an absolute necessity to do my work so would never even attempt that, this problem seems completely spontaneous.

And now with everything that's going on, it's way too risky to get someone to take a look at it, so I'm really hoping this is something I can fix on my own.

It's seriously looking like I'm going to have to deal with this for the foreseeable future, which is a pain because everything I do on this requires fairly quick typing, and this slows me down to a painfully sluggish speed.

Please give me whatever advice you can spare, I'm willing to try anything short of a factory reset.",0,1585551654,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frm1y5/certain_keys_on_my_laptop_are_behaving_strangely/,techsupport,1
frm0rh,yonnylol,Sound problems," 

Hey guys,

1 month ago, my PC started to glitch a bit. While playing games, the sound went off with a click like sound, froze everything for a quarter of a sec and my sound was gone. The method for temporary fixing it was re-pluging my headsets usb, then everything was good and it keeps coming back in every 20-25 mins. I tried to update Razer syanpse, didnt help. Updated all my drivers, didnt help. Rolled back Realtek driver, didnt help. Reinstalled windows as a clean install, didnt help. Turned off the option ""Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"" for USB Root hub and Intel USB 3.0 extensible host controller, and guess what.. didnt help. I made sure power cords are properly attached to everything inside the rig, didnt help. I even tried my headphones (in case thats the criminal mind here) on my girlfriend's pc, and it did jacksh\*t. I'm on the edge of insanity since i cant fix this. Do we have a mastermind around here who could help me out?

frly9x,8InchMale,Pc won’t boot up even after trying every diagnosis.,"My pc specs: 
Ryzen 5 3600 (cpu)
Rx 5700xt (gpu)
16gb ddr4 3200mhz Corsair vengeance
Msi b450 pro max motherboard

Recently I have been playing a new battle royal mode on cod modern warfare warzone.The Pc has never had a crash when I was in normal multiplayer game modes but battle Royale mode crashed my pc (force shut down) with no alerts or messages once every 3 games. When it first started happening doing simple things like a power drain worked and was able to boot up my pc. Now it isn’t showing any signals after trying many different diagnostics. The fans turn on the led lights turn on the rgb lights turn on but no signal on the monitor 

1. I tried different cables on both the monitor and the Psu to see if there was a cable issue but there wasn’t.
2. I tried a different monitor to see if my monitor was the problem but no signal on a working monitor either.
3. I tried a different power supply that works for my other pc and is rated better with 600w instead of 550w and that still didn’t fix the issue.
4. I have done power drains multiple times and cmos resets.
5 I have taken the ram and gpu out of their slots cleans them and reseated them.
6 I put the gpu in the second pcie slot on the motherboard still no signs.
7 I took out the gpu and plugged the hdmi cable onto the onboard graphics and that also didn’t show any signals
8 I switched the ram around in all 4 slots one at a time but still didn’t work. I couldn’t replace the ram since the ram in the other Pc is different and won’t fit. But the ram does have rgb lighting which has been lighting up just fine.
9 As a last resort I have taken the fan off the cpu taken the cpu out checked if any pins were bent which didn’t seem to be the but I could have missed it. And I reseated the cpu and tried again.
All these steps have not worked. The only error code I can remember is when the system crashed after playing a session it showed a blue screen when self repairing on reboot which read “dpc watchdog violation”.
The cpu was put under a fair bit of load about 60% while playing the game and temps of about 80-85 degrees Celsius, the gpu temps were much lower at 55-60. These temps are not unsafe or unusual while gaming and they are also safe considering that amd says 100 degrees+ is considered unsafe. My pc has never hit about 90. I’ve been using this rig for 2
Months now and would like to fix the issue if I can.

Thank you.
TLDR: a battle Royale game crashed my pc at 80-85 degree temps for cpu and 60% usage.

But the moment I'm inside the boat the same wifi signal is barely usable, all my devices have trouble connecting to it with some working better than others. Some parts of my boat just doesn't have a signal at all. 

I found some commercially available products I think will work, the cheapest being ubiquiti bullet. I also found some (marine specific) options that exceed $1000, which is far more than my budget would allow. 

So my question is, how could I do this? Is there a way I could do it cheaply or would I be better off buying something like the bullet? The goal is to have wifi inside the boat, and not just supply a single device with wifi.

Few years ago my pc kept blue screening and telling me my HDD was corrupt so bought new HDD for storage and SSD for boot. Things were sorted for few days/weeks but moved house and  never bothered to sort it as internet connection here is poor. 

Anyway, booted up the pc the other day and once again it had wiped itself. Reinstalled windows onto the newer hdd did updates etc and couple days later, blue screen. Didnt wipe itself but got a blue screen - i’d be lying if i said i can remember the popup. Coped with blue screen happening a couple times until it kept saying corrupt disk whenver i tried installing.

I said enough and reformated everything and once again reinstalled windows yesterday. Everything was fine, was running windows updates last night okay when i went to bed.
Just woke up to check it and its asking to choose correct boot location? Looks like the ssd has been wiped again on its own.

Running out of ideas now, i’ve checked that they’re plugged in correctly. They can’t both be damaged when they’ve been like this from pretty much out of the box? Imm baffled.

The pc is old, i built it back in 2013 but should still be fine for every day use rather than crashing on me every two days or so.

Components are;

I5 2380p
Asus h61m
Nvidia gtx 770

My oh so smart child changed his phone Security PIN to Pattern lock then forgot what the pattern was.  After several hours and I won't say how many attempts of trying a pattern, the only option Google Support had was to factory reset the phone. Thus I factory reset the phone. 
When I tried to set up his phone after factory reset it would allow me to go through Family Link with my email and Password to allow his account to be set up but it failed to  connect and allow a backup to be set up on his phone. I tried for 2 hours pausing for my sanity for a few minutes here and there. I finally stopped and decide to wAit overnight and try again which was 12 hours.
I did a new factory reset just in case and went through the normal setting up phone procedure including entering my email and password allowing kid's account to be set up. Suddenly it accepted the account but said there was no cloud backup associated with the account. This was odd as I personally go on kids phones and start a backup once a week. But to no avail and no Google Support available and phone needed for school work that requires mobile device app from Google Play for the class project (or if iPhone Apples app store).
I ended up setting the phone up from scratch as if he never had any apps From Google Play thus losing data that was previously saved within Google Play Services for several apps.
Downloaded every app he needed that was on the phone before without Google Family Link requesting approval from me as parent
Except for one app that was on his phone previously and was approved through Google Family Link years before.
The app is called Telegram by Telegram, LLC and us a Chat app that is necessary for 2 organizations that only use that app for Communications with Parents and the kids. 

I do not have Telegram blocked as an app. I do not have the website blocked that is associated with the app. Telegram is listed in his library on Google Play but with an info button that when pressed says blocked by Google Family Link. I gave the Family Link for this kid set for Teen limits and again I cannot for the life of my find out where it would caused you be blocked. He can request and install other Chat apps such as Signal, Snapchat, WhatsApp, TikTok, and more without being blocked.

frlj90,ryan5091,"Secondary HDD in laptop performance isn't good, seeing this in the SMART status despite saying good health","Hello, I recently picked up a Lenovo Y540 with the 1TB secondary drive. It was perfect out of the box and performance seemed to be fine. However lately I noticed steam games were downloading much slower then usual, or what I've seen this laptop download before. I thought it was just my network connection, but when doing speed tests everything was working just fine. I downloaded a game to my SSD boot drive and it downloaded at the speeds that it was suppose to. 

I then loaded up HDD Tune and looked at the smart status. Everything seemed fine, but as I was letting steam try to download a game I saw that the ""Raw Read Error Rate"" and ""Seek Error Rate"" was increasing tremendously. It doesn't stop until the drive has no activity. I've also noticed in task manager that the drives response time seems to be unusually high. Could this be a sign that the drive is already failing despite only being owned for less then a month? SMART reports back being good and healthy but the performance just downright, well, sucks. It's a newer Seagate Barracuda, I know in the past there was some reliability issues with some seagate drive, but I heard the newer ones have been pretty good. 

So, did my drive really come in defective? I would like to think a $1,000+ laptop wouldn't come with faulty components. I'll buy a new secondary drive if I have too (Upgrade to a 2TB if I really wanted too) but I didn't think I would have to do so.",4,1585548919,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frlj90/secondary_hdd_in_laptop_performance_isnt_good/,techsupport,1

The other partitions are protected. I have the option to delete the partitions but I already messed up once by deleting a partition.

frkxsd,frechettey,"Okay that is it, i completely give up on trying to do this myself and I need dall of your help because you fellas are awesome.","So I am going to get straight to the point, here are my specs first

Ryzen 1600x 3.6Ghz

16GB Single Stick 2400Mhz (Patriot)

GTX 980 TI SC EVGA

500GB Samsung SSD

120GB Kingston SSD

850w Antec PW

all at 1440p resolution 60Hz

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So just recently I jumped back into Destiny 2, and something is just off. My preformance when not on V-SYNC caps at like 85 on any planet, yet my friend playing on lower specs hits consistent 90FPS at 1440p. This is completely regardless of settings I throw on. Also when I do have V-SYNC on, its 60fps then dips to 40-49fps constantly, no matter what planet or mode. Now I only play COD:MW and D2 so Ill focus on those. Also I did a raid in Destiny 2 yesterday, and as we went along it would go back to 60FPS, but felt like it dropped more frequently as we went on, and then my game crashed 4 times while we were doing the boss fight, and when I looked in the event logs i got 0xc0000005 error code as a crash but I did the SFC /scannow trick and it said it repaired files so not sure if that is worth mentioning. ALSO minor thing but when I replaced my GPU thermal paste, all my games kept crashing with cod giving DEV ERROR 6068 and I installed Overwatch and I could open it but once I loaded into a game and clicked on a character I would get ""Render device lost"" and i repeated this and everytime it let me get into a game and click on a character, it would do this, but both of these issues have been resolved since reinstalling Windows.

COD:MW runs fine at 60FPS no problem and high settings or anything really, but when i turn off V-SYNC I'm only getting around 80FPS which from what I've seen online is not right/

  I read that ICUE can cause issues, so I uninstalled it and my FPS seems to be increased but still only to like 85FPS and the drops are A FRACTION less consistant but still there very noticabley. I also noticed my temps when Idling for GPU was 65c and my processor was 55c. So I changed my thermal paste on my CPU and GPU....

Now my CPU Idles at 35c and GPU at 45c-48c, great? Still the same problem.  I have taken apart my computer, same problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will be playing and it just dips to 45 real bad, and then goes back to 60FPS, COD doesn't have this problem, but like I said still not getting the preformance I have seen.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to run down what I have tried in the past 2 days...

&amp;#x200B;

New thermal Paste on CPU AND GPU

Reseated RAM into different slots

OC'd variable levels (Ram is not OC'able but I tried lol, processor I put to 3.9Ghz but made no difference)

Various software changes (uninstall anything that could affect anything. Uninstalled drives and reinstalled, power mangement for global settings in Nvidia CP set to MAX power and CPU in Power plan settings set to High preformance, Variety of game settings)

Updated BIOS from F2 to F31

Just reinstalled windows recently which the PC using it feels fantastic and Idle temps are great and when I played D2 to try it the temps never went above 65c on GPU so big win there, BUT Destiny 2 drops huge frames, and when I uncap I hit 140FPS+ in orbit (the menu) but when im on any planet its 60FPS then drops to 45FPS with no change of scenary. Haven't tested COD yet as its still installing.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I guess I feel my PC isn't getting the preformance it should, and at this point I feel I have tried everything and I can rule it too my ram being only 2400Mhz and Ryzen likes faster speeds, OR my PSU is going as it is older and I originally got it used.

My bios seemed fine with the ram showing 3200 and my fan changed easily but I also noticed I didn't have 'game mode' on so I turned that on but after restarting now when I try turn on my PC it either sits on a black screen or now my monitor doesn't even detect a signal and my peripherals don't come on.

frkuwk,RexAssassin8,Acer Predator Triton 500 2080RTX Black Screen,"Hello to anyone who reads this post, 

My laptop screen blacks out whenever I play R6 or CS:GO. The issue only happens on these two games and happens very inconsistently. When this black screen appears, I can still hear the audio from the game and my discord but eventually it starts to loop and my computer shuts down. Whenever I try to reboot it the boot up time takes much longer then it normally does when I'm first starting up my computer. There is no way to really replicate this problem as it happens randomly. Sometimes I can play the game for an hour or two, sometimes the game crashes 5 minutes after I load into a match. I've had this laptop since April of 2019 and this issue has been going on for essentially the entirety of the time that I have had it. I have contacted many supports about this issue such as Acer support, Microsoft support (the legitimate one lol), Ubisoft support, and Steam support. Ubisoft was the one support which actually helped me, the rest gave me useless information and ended the ticket on me. I've also tried sending the my laptop back in for repair, Acer couldn't find anything wrong with the hardware but they did screw up my fans so I had to fix that. This computer runs ridiculously well though in every game. I've already tried a clean Windows boot, reinstalling graphics drivers, resetting the internal battery, asking for support on the forums, reinstalling the games, getting an external fan in case of it being overheating, and using compressed air to clean out dust on the inside. If anyone can provide any information or solutions for this issue it would be much obliged. I was considering sending it back for replacement but apparently my 1 year warranty was expired even though it hasn't been a year. Sorry for the long read, thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

Also : I've looked at the crash reliability history thanks to Ubisoft and every time my laptop crashes (the red X's) it says Windows failed to shut down properly. Might mean something but I'm not sure.

Here are some pics of some evidence of the issue:

I want the 111.78gb of unallocated space to be added to my Windows 98.64gb partition. Hopefully I can add the 12gb recovery partition, as well. 

There must be some setting issue that I am missing as it wouldn't make sense for this software to exist if it has this limitation. 

I don't want multiple partitions either, as I want it all to be on one.

The current TV I own is a Hanimex Portavision. It's good and all but it only takes that aerial cable in. I've been playing my PS2 on it because back in the day I bought an RF-unit Auto Switch for it. Of course I want to play more than just my PS2, and it would be really useful if I could get some sort of composite to coaxial converter or HDMI to coaxial. Just basically anything else to coaxial (or tv signal I really don't know what it's called, whatever plugs into the thing in the images I linked).

Is there anything like that I can buy for relatively cheap?

So recently I was given an old Dell Inspiron 3520 as a gift to try and fix. Turns out, the battery is junk and I’ll need to buy a new one, but before I do so, I want to know if it’s worth the money. 

So as the title suggests, this thing runs terribly slow, and I can’t figure out why. I’ve upgraded the boot drive to an SSD (Lexar 128gb), I’ve upgraded the CPU to an i5-3210m I believe, and I’ve also installed 8gb of DDR3 RAM @ 1600Mhz. 

Now I know it’s nothing impressive, but for Christmas I upgraded a laptop for my girlfriend with similar specs and it runs smooth as can be, but this thing runs like a brick. I was wondering if it’s because I’m run in it off of just the power adapter (which, by the way, is from a different laptop, so I’m not sure if that could be it either), or if it’s just destined to run like this forever.",2,1585542987,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frkbn7/dell_laptop_unbearably_slow/,techsupport,1

Computer has been perfectly fine up until yesterday (fast boot times in roughly 10-15 seconds to desktop ready).

I installed a program called Sibelius 8 (music notation software) and the boot time is now roughly 2 mins. So I uninstalled the software and removed all files associated to it, but the boot time remains around 2 minutes. I ran SFC scan, nothing. Did a startup repair and it said it cannot fix my computer. I checked startup items and nothing in there out of the ordinary, though there was a small program running for the software before I uninstalled everything.

Not sure what else I can try at this point? It might help to note that the hang up happens between the Windows 10 boot logo and the user login screen. Once the login screen comes up the computer is EXACTLY as it always is - fast and easy to use. 

In case this matters:

i5 4670  
8GB DDR3  
2x 120gb SSD (one specifically for Windows 10, the software wasn't even installed on this)  
2x 1TB drives (one for programs, one for data)

frk511,Talyonn,My laptop is too lazy.,"Hello. 

I've had an Asus UX430UAR for two years right now. It's a pretty good laptop if you ask me but it started to have some issues. 

The laptop don't want to wake up from sleep. EVER. I always have to hard reset it by letting the power button pressed for 6 seconds or so. I also lose everything if it randomly goes to sleep.

It started 3 to 4 months ago, pretty mildly. The laptopt wouldn't wake up randomly after I closed the lid. Maybe one out of five time. Now it evolved to a state where the laptop will NEVER wake up if it's put to sleep. 

Also, I don't know if it's related or not, but the laptop sometimes randomly turn on when the lid is closed and will heat up to the point it's real hot to the touch until it run out of battery. With this issue I ALWAYS have to transport the laptop with the power cord or else it'll not turn on.

I tried : 

* Don't let the laptop sleep in power consumption options, only hibernate.
* Updating the BIOS or every drivers.
* Wake up on lid opening in the bios.
* Allowing the keyboard to wake up the computer (mouse too).
* Some intel power management software recommended by Asus for this specific problem. Didn't work at all.
* Typing powercfg in a command prompt for some reasons.
* Never putting the laptop to sleep, which is pretty hard to do when I just fall asleep with the laptop on.

Alright so there you have it. It's gotten to the point where I'll probably have to buy another laptop even though this one is still good so I figured I would ask here if somebody would have a solution.

Last thing I'll do will be installing an older version of windows to see if it's due to the fall update or something.",2,1585542117,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frk511/my_laptop_is_too_lazy/,techsupport,1

So I'm fairly careful when it comes to files that I'm downloading, or websites that I'm visitng, however, recently I was looking for an old game that I couldn't purchase online. I ended up pirating it, it was a zip file containing a pre-installed folder of the game. As soon as I extracted it, my antivirus detected one of the .dll files as a Trojan.Gen2 or something along those lines and quarantined it. Even though I probably shouldn't have, I ended up running the game anyway, and it ran as it should have with no issues. I still ended up deleting the quarantined file and deleting all files.

I'm not really experiencing any issues with my computer as of right now. After a few scans my antivirus (Symantec Endpoint Protection) as well as malwarebytes tell me that my pc is clean.


Despite this I have this nagging feeling that I should nuke windows just in case. I am a little hesitant to do this because I have a lot of software licenses that would be a huge hassle to reactivate. Should I do it anyway or would I be safe trusting my antivirus?

2) Running in safe mode. It gives the same error: everything runs normally until I enter my password, upon loading in I'm greeted with a black screen and mouse where my desktop should be.

3) I have tried resetting to a memory point (I don't remember what it's called, but I chose to reset to a saved point from a time when this error hadn't yet occured)

Additionally, I don't think it's a corrupt profile, because I already had an extra account for school work, and upon loading in im greeted with the screen.

Today in a social call my friend recommended my sister download Snapchat camera for PC. She has an Asus windows 10 laptop. she asked for help so I downloaded it from the official site. All of a sudden her microphone stopped working in the zoom call. I tried swapping camera inputs from snapcam to her regular built in webcam. Nothing. I tried to give microphone permission to zoom or snapcam but neither even came up on the list in settings. I rebooted, nothing. Frustrated, I tried to download it on my Acer laptop to see if it would be different. I did all the same things and boom no mic input. Only difference is I have FL studio, which has a sound driver (FL Studio Asio). I can't say I've used my built in mic in the past while, I have a small recording setup with an audio interface and microphone, so I'm not positive that my mic would've worked before. My blue snowball ice microphone still functions as normal, in zoom and FL studio. I ran a scan on Malwarebytes and got nothing. I deleted all instances of the snap camera program, nothing, still nothing from the stock mic. In the audio settings on Zoom there's a drop down for mic input selection, but it is blank and you can't change it. The speaker input can be changed from my built in speakers to same as system.  I rebooted twice with no difference. If you have any questions I'll try to answer them but this is mostly what I know and I'm lost on how to get both my sisters mic and mine to work again.

I have an iPhone 6s Plus and recently got the update. I was on a phone call prior, but hung up. I then went on Safari and everything was fine. But, when I closed Safari, there was the green line you get when you’re still in the call. It appeared for 2 seconds and disappeared.

Is this normal? I’m freaking out and losing my mind over this.

frjwwk,bassboostedasmr,"Can't eject virtual disk, doesn't show up in Disk Management/Device Manager, system restore didn't work","Windows 10, mounted a disk image to run an old PC game, didn't work, now can't eject the disk. It's currently unmounted, clicking on it in File Explorer says ""please insert a disk,"" and trying to eject it just says there was a problem ejecting it.

I can remount the disk no problem, it immediately becomes the game disk I was trying to run. I can unmount it again, and it turns blank and gives me the ""please insert a disk"" message when clicking on it. Ejecting it doesn't work in either scenario.

All the solutions I've found for being unable to eject a virtually mounted ISO or BIN file involve going into Device Manager and deleting it that way, but nothing shows up there or in Disk Management. It's currently ""mounted"" as E: and only my B: drive (HDD), C: drive (SSD), and D: drive (CD/DVD drive) appear anywhere. This is the case whether or not the game disk is actually mounted or not.

I haven't found any suggestions or solutions that don't end with either a system restore (I've done 2 of those now, no effect), or using Device Manager, which it straight up doesn't appear in (unless it's super not-obvious what it's labelled as). It hasn't posed any real problem to my PC so far, but I'd really like to get it to go away for my own sanity.",0,1585541084,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frjwwk/cant_eject_virtual_disk_doesnt_show_up_in_disk/,techsupport,1

I have 8GB of ddr3 RAM and need to run at least 4 virtual machines but with just my regular RAM I can only open 2. The VMs will all be linux so I can afford to keep RAM on these as low as possible. Will increasing the virtual memory on my host (windows) to around 4GB (currently at 1.5GB) allow me to run most of these machines?

Also, my Laptop has in Intel Pentium processor (in case this has an effect, which I think it might).

So I have my cable modem and separate router in my office upstairs. Modem is connected to router - router then has an Ethernet cable to my desktop (works fine) and then another port on router goes into the wall jack. My house is pre wired and it all goes into a closet compartment (see pic). 

I put an unmanaged switch in there and tried plugging in various Ethernet (blue ) cords in the pic since they are unlabeled. 

I am trying to use the switch to get wired internet on my smart TV downstairs. No matter what combination of plugs I never get any lights appearing on the switch nor any connection downstairs. 

Am I missing something ?

frjmz5,F1U00,RX 5700xt Sapphire Nitro RGB won't work,"So, I bought this card last December and it's worked flawlessly ever since. This all changed yesterday when I decided to buy an M.2 SSD and a Hyper 212 Evo. So I already had a hard drive in the PC and I had been able to control the cards RGB with he trixx software perfectly when I first got it. After some trouble with the M.2 and the hard drive I decided to just wipe the hard drive of everything and start with my PC basically from scratch to have windows on the M.2. After some trial and error I was able to put Windows on the M.2 so I started installing all my programs and everything. I installed trixx and tried controlling the RGB but nothing changed on the card. Before I had deleted everything I had the card on purple so it just stayed on purple. After turning my PC off and reseating the GPU when I booted it back on the RGB was just completely off instead of it being purple. I deleted trixx and reinstalled it multiple times, even trying older versions but nothing would work. The software even recognizes the GPU bit won't control the RGB. Something to add on is that I had played Borderlands 3 earlier today and was getting horrible framerates, in the low 60s to low 70s. Before this whole situation I had been getting north of 110 FPS on basically max settings with no issues. I'm just saying this since it's another weird thing going on with the GPU. For the record, I just removed the GPU drivers and reinstalled them and it still isn't working.",0,1585539880,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frjmz5/rx_5700xt_sapphire_nitro_rgb_wont_work/,techsupport,1

So I've been on this issue for a few days. I have even contacted Windows 4 times and they tried different things and all failed. I tried everything that I know in conjunction with their work. I'm at the end of my rope here.

* I turned on the computer one day, and when I went to turn up the volume, it had the notification ""The audio service is not active"". No biggie, I manage to get the audio service running, annnnd surprise, the audio still doesn't work.
* I reinstalled the drivers and it still didn't work.
* Tried updating Windows, failed. (Error Code: 0x80070003) I also tried to hard AND factory reset but both also failed.
* The system fails to play test tones.
* This is almost certainly a software issue due the fact that my computer is pretty new, (&lt;1 year, laptop) and that the speakers fail to even recognize audio is being played (I play audio in the background and the system thinks everything is silent).
* I am not using headphones or external audio devices.
* The speakers are not muted, at 100 volume, and my default device.
* My computer is the Eluktronics MECH-17 G1Rx (If that helps anything.)
* This did not happen after an update, I merely turned it on and the issue arose. I did not change anything besides plugging in some wireless headphones a few days earlier. (The headphone's data has been removed from the system in my quest to fix the issue.)",0,1585538697,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frjd6t/the_audio_is_gone_on_my_computer_after_turning_it/,techsupport,1

* I reinstalled the drivers and it still didn't work.
* Tried updating Windows, failed. (Error Code: 0x80070003) I also tried to hard AND factory reset but both also failed.
* The system fails to play test tones.
* This is almost certainly a software issue due the fact that my computer is pretty new, (&lt;1 year, laptop) and that the speakers fail to even recognize audio is being played (I play audio in the background and the system thinks everything is silent).
* I am not using headphones or external audio devices.
* The speakers are not muted, at 100 volume, and my default device.
* My computer is the Eluktronics MECH-17 G1Rx (If that helps anything.)

&amp;#x200B;

I recently stumbled with issued when using my Scarlett 2i2 interface on my laptop, and I'm assuming it had a short circuit, but I still tried testing it on my brother's laptop to try and troubleshoot it on a different system so that i could at least see if it would work there. Sadly the audio interface wasn't working even after installing its driver and Visual C++ (the driver wanted to install that for some reason) and restarting his laptop.   


After that night, my brother tried working on his thesis, he depended on a lot of architecture programs, but he was unable to open most of the apps, most of which where working before i plugged my interface for troubleshooting. A pop up error message would appear every time he opened some of his apps, stating the the computer was unable to open the app, whats weird is that this error happened on multiple apps (but not every app). He tried running on safe mode but the apps were still unable to open.

The only way that this can be resolved is by restarting my laptop.

I've had this issue for some time althouugh the frequency in which it occurs can vary greatly. Sometimes I might go weeks without a problem and sometimes I might have it happen several times in a single sitting.

Things that I have tried:

1) Updated drivers for my network adaptor (Qualcomm doesn't appear to have a website to download these but I have found some others that seem repuable from different driver sites including Microsoft's catalogue.)

2) I disabled my network adapter power saving settings.

3) Changed Scan Valid Interval to 120

4) Forget and reconnected the Wireless Network

5) Released and renewed my IP address and flushed the DNS resolver cache.

I think I have tried  disabling IPv6 in the past as that was a recommdation although I switched it back when it didn't produce any results because I wasn't sure what else it could affect.

I've read that it might apparently be an issue with a faulty driver that Qualcomm hasn't properly addressed with Windows 10 and if that's the case I might be out of luck so I'm considering just buying a USB Wifi dongle.

Here's the troubleshooting I tried:

1. Plug the laptop into a different device. HDMI audio appears as an option and plays just fine.
2. Different cables - tried 3 known good, all had the same issue
3. Confirm the Xbox and other devices are playing audio over HDMI - yep
4. Update audio/GPU drivers to the latest from Dell's website
5. Restart
6. Unplug/replug (like 20 times)
7. Plug the laptop into the Xbox using HDMI pass-through (treating it like a TV)

&amp;#x200B;

So, it's weird that the cable/HDMI port can handle audio as demonstrated by the Xbox working fine and the computer can do audio over HDMI as demonstrated by plugging it into the projector directly. That tells me that the cable is good, the receiver is good, and the laptop is good but... Huh? Any ideas?

Last few days I've been noticing that my PC will start to stutter (mouse skips around, image will skip almost like its frame for frame and the audio will skip and sound choppy). They only thing that will help is to restart the system. But even when attempting to restart the system it will take a while to shut down. I've done a ram memory test. Passed. Updated drivers with driver tools. Performed memory defragment. When issue occurs checked system performance. All four category's are below 50%.

fribnr,shadowfyre9,Please help me with random 2s computer freezes,"When i am using my computer (mostly when playing games, but also when using photoshop, or even just the general desktop usage), i get short freezes of approx 1-2s. When playing games, after the freeze, it plays those frozen 2 seconds back in about 10x speed. Freezes happen approx once every 30s  - 2minutes

Sometimes rebooting the computer it will be fine for a while, then it will come back.

My computer is approx 5 years old, but the main games i am playing are even older (Diablo 3, WOW Classic, POE).

I have checked CPU usage, GPU usage, temperatures, memory usage. All are absolutely within spec. CPU runs around 40c, GPU 60c. CPU not capping, neither is memory.

Computer specs are:

\- i5-4690k CPU @ 3.5GHz overclocked to 4.1GHz (tried removing overclock too, no difference)

\- 8GB Ram

\- Asus H97M-Plus motherboard

\- GTX 970 GFX card

\- Mushkin 240GB SSD (MKNSSDCR240GB-DX7)

All drivers are up to date. Gaming typically at 1440p, but also tried running games on 1080, low settings, no AA etc... doesnt seem to make any difference.

I've read a lot of forum posts, and nothing conclusive, but suggestions that it could be an SSD issue, while the OS waits to write to the disk?

Also checked windows event log, and no events in there are timing with the freezes

I've spent 3 hours working on trying to figure this out and it's just so fucking frustrating. It isn't stereo mix, it isn't ""listen to this device"". I've uninstalled and reinstalled realtek drivers more times than I can count. One thing that made a difference was downloading a generic realtek audio driver from their website which made my microphone quieter and have less static, but audio would play out of the headphones and the speakers at the same time so there was no way to test if it wasn't picking up my computers audio.

Yesterday I repasted my CPU and GPU not that that should have had any effect, had no audio issues tomorrow. Earlier today I moved my laptop to a different place and when I unplugged the charging cord it shut off (never happened before and no reason it should have, turned on without plugging the cord back in). My worry at first was that I didn't plug the battery back in all the way when I repasted it and I'd have to open it again but now it seems fine. I think my headset might have been plugged in when that happened though, could it have somehow shorted and damaged the 3.5mm jack somehow? I also only see one device for Speakers (realtek(R) audio) and Microphone (Realtek(R) Audio) when I feel like I remember seeing different devices before but after all the driver uninstalling and reinstalling I'm not entirely sure

The pc randomly restarts with no BSOD just screen goes black and restarts. I've tried to narrow down the problem and this is what I've come to think its either the Motherboard or the PSU. Probably the motherboard because I've stressed tested the CPU with CPUID Powermax no issues. Heaven benchmark for GPU. Then came the ram (running at 2666mhz no xmp or oc) I've tested it with memtest86 and memtest64. Everything looked fine. I then turned on xmp and set my ram to 3200mhz and that's when the issue became really bad it would restart about 10 mins and memtest86 wont complete will just restart at the beginning of the test. The higher the frequency the faster the restart started to happen. (Also 3600mhz wont work). So I changed the ram and I thought everything was good (this one is running at 2666mhz) but after a while it did it again couple hours of having the PC on. Restarts happen doing anything could playing games to just idling. I also returned the corsair ram since it wont go up to 3600mhz. Since it does it randomly it's hard to see whether I should return the PSU or the Motherboard and with the epidemic I'm not sure which to return. Mostly I've say it has to do with motherboard ram slots since it worse going up in frequency. Thanks for the help.

When I go into Finder and look at Documents, iTunes isn't in there, neither are some of the other things that appear to be under Documents in the ""Manager"" section. So is there two different types of ""Documents"" folders? And is iTunes being counted twice for some reason?

My question is: could this problem with the psu be the one causing my 100c temp cpu while in game? Like It’s not giving the right amount of power needed by my gpu in game so my cpu is overloading and trying to do the work...?

Psu: masterwatt lite 700w it’s a shitty one which I’m replacing soon, was thinking of cougar stx 650w also cheap but for the same price as my current one but if you don’t advise it, I’m open for suggestions on affordable ones

Specs: 
Mobo: meg ace z390
Cpu: intel i7-9700(wanted to avoid watercooling)
Ram: hyperx fury 3200 1x16GB 
Gpu: msi duke force gtx 1080ti

frhngh,themarkwithamouth,Laptop Non-OS HDD upgrade to SSD,"Hi everyone, I'm looking to upgrade the non-OS internal HDD (literally everything else except OS) of my laptop to a SSD, and have been doing a lot of reading about how to do it. However most of the content I find online are for replacing OS drives, and so - disk cloning, which I understand I don't need to do. I would appreciate it if you can read through the steps I'm gonna do based on so much info. from everywhere online, so to see if I've got the understanding of how it's supposed to work out.

1. Make sure SSD is SATA, 2.5"" with relatively the same dimensions as the HDD
2. Take out old HDD
3. Put in new SSD
4. Change BIOS settings to AHCI
5. Plug in old HDD through a SATA enclosure
6. Copy/Paste all data into SSD
7. Change drive letter of SSD to the same drive letter of the old HDD.

Would it be as simple as this? Also are there any limitations as to how much SSD storage a laptop can have?

Any insight is appreciated. Thank you everyone.",7,1585531717,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frhngh/laptop_nonos_hdd_upgrade_to_ssd/,techsupport,1

frhkvu,newaccountblabla,Windows 10 not booting. Last options?,"Hi,
To start off, I'm fairly tech savvy but cannot for the life of me fix my computer.

Windows 10.
I downloaded Microsoft update tool so 'upgrade' with the intentions of 'refreshing' the install without losing files, apps and data.
I'm not too sure what happened when restarting I got the error
'inset proper boot media'

I managed to fix that and then Windows kept looping into recovery. Where it shows command prompt, restore, uninstall updates etc
Automatic repair fails and the pc just loops into that.



On my disk (850 Pro) I have my fat32 partition with the efi folder, 2 recovery partitions and the Windows partition

I've installed Windows tool onto my USB drive and booting into that says something about I'm in the process of an upgrade and I've booted from installation media..

Using the 'repair my computer' on the USB and CMD I've ran
'bcdedit' which shows my partition E: and shows path as system32/winload.exe
I've browsed that directory and there is no winload.exe nor is there on my gfs laptop (windows 10).


Bootrec /scanos
Shows 0 installations so the install must be in the BCD store?

Desperately in need of help since I'm going mad after trying last night, going to sleep and then 4 hours now.

I don't want to install windows fresh, that will be the very last option.

**Behaviour of the problem:** below error messages appear and freeze the games (majority of the time), requiring forced end tasking of the game, sometimes it will freeze the whole PC and sometimes it will crash to desktop (more rare). below are the games I've tested so far, there are probably more to come.

**Frequency:** Cannot remember a time without having issues. 1 out of 10 times I can run the games for hours without the issue coming up. 90% of the time the error will appear within minutes of running, making them unplayable. I generally run games to what the game or the GPU app (GeForce Experience) deems recommended settings for my hardware. What tends to extend play time (not 100% sure on the exact combination of settings that allow it to work for longer periods) is running the games at the absolute lowest graphic quality and resolution settings (this makes it almost unplayable too). This will still lead to freezing.

I recently bought a PNY GeForce RTX 2080 Super 8GB Blower Edition and I was wondering what type of aftermarket air coolers I could get. I'm not experienced in GPU cooler replacement and I really dont want to mess it up. 

I want to change it out because the fan gets loud (yes, I know its stressed) but I feel like the cooling could be better, or at least a little bit quieter. 

Also, the card doesnt come with a backplate so it's a complete difference than the ROG 1070 I had before it.",0,1585528797,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frgwde/gpu_cooler_replacement/,techsupport,1
frgunh,The_Kalmado,Windows 10 Audio Stutter and cutting out,"Specs

* I5-3550
* Dell OEM LGA 1155 mATX board
* 1xSSD 1xHDD
* Asus R9 380 4GB
* Seasonic Focus 750w 80+ Gold
* Windows 10 Pro (activated of course)

**Problem**

Audio stutter that varies when under load. When using Youtube or streaming video sound is fine. Any game (Steam, Uplay, etc) and Heaven Benchmark will have audio stutter. Can be every few seconds. Could be once every 15 seconds or so. Never goes away. 

I snagged some desktops from my old job and am rebuilding for friends and myself. Built a PC using the main parts above for a living room PC. I've built a number of PCs and I have never come across this problem. Things I've tried so far:

* Monitor with Latencymon
* Update to most recent BIOS
* All drivers up to date
* Changing power settings to basically max performance
* Format SSD and reinstall W10
* Disable Intel LAN
* Disable fast start
* Multiple HDMI tested
* Tested another PC in same physical spot without issue

I've spent the last three days going thru at least 30 forum threads from various sites (tech, windows, YT videos, etc) doing any and all suggestions and nothing has worked so far. Regarding Latencymon, it was pointing towards the LAN causing issues and that is why I disabled it. After doing so Latencymon always reads 
&gt; Your system appears to be suitable for handling real-time audio and other tasks without dropouts.
but audio will still cut out randomly. 

Audio problems still persist after everything I've tried. I am absolutely baffled by this. I'm really wondering if maybe the MB has just had it or maybe I should try W7.

frgr5z,DKill77x,Windows 10 not working &amp; now not booting either,"Hi guys, so I’m fairly literate when it comes to troubleshooting technical issues but I’ve tried everything to my knowledge and don’t know what else to do.

The Issue:

I booted up my PC today and all my apps were missing from the home screen. I clicked around and an error popped up saying “Windows 10 stopped/isn’t working”. Googled around, and it suggested to open the task manger and end the “desktop windows manager” task. I kept trying and it wasn’t working.

The only running applications were task a manger and malware bytes. As soon as I closed malware bytes, my windows started working again. Thinking malware bytes was the issue, I uninstalled it.

Turns out, the drive where my windows is installed was completely maxed out with barely any space on it - so I’m assuming closing malware bytes gave it enough temporary space to work fine.

My PC was now working fine, but I restarted to double check that it was also booting properly. 

——

Well, it’s not. Now windows isn’t booting AT ALL. I tried resetting, but it said it needed additional hard drive space. Googled around some more, and eventually got to opening the notepad from the command prompt and deleting files to make space. I could now reset the PC, but sometime throughout the reset, an error pops up and says it could not reset the PC.


——

So now I’m completely and don’t know what to do. Is it an issue with the hard drive? Maybe clean some of the hardware (dust)? Or could it be a software issue (virus)?

Any and all help would be tremendously appreciated!!",2,1585528280,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frgr5z/windows_10_not_working_now_not_booting_either/,techsupport,1

frgilo,dmcphx,Trying to help my brother figure out a problem with his laptop &amp; remote working,"   My brother apparently has this VERY ongoing issue with his work laptop, 

   His company wants him to be able to work from home,    but any time he tries to connect through his remote access vpn &amp; company software they use,    it will let him get through the VPN,    but the software (Apprise) takes FOREVER to do anything. 

   He says he doesn’t have this issue ANYWHERE else other than at home.    No one else at his company has this issue. 

   We even got as far to borrow a router from a friend (what he has is a Ubee Modem / Router in one box from Spectrum), 

   but once he connected the Netgear router,    the problem fixed instantly. 

   The long &amp; short is ~    why would he have such difficulty connecting ONLY at home ONE on this Ubee modem / router box from Spectrum, 

   while anywhere else works,    or even on a different router at home. 

   I know the obvious answer is just get a new router ourselves,    but we’re just curious what it could be that would be making this Apprise software not work (it’s like you click anything,    &amp; it just has a spinning “loading wheel” for forever,    &amp; just will never open the ability to do anything in the Apprise application.)    on just the Ubee thing. 

   TL;DR,   trying to figure out why when my brother is trying to work remotely from home,    it’s the ONLY place he can’t get his remote work application Apprise to not work correctly,    while he can with the same computer on literally any other network anywhere else.    Doesn’t even work with Ethernet so it’s not just WiFi.

frgh5d,SpookyAndykins,Potential CPU issue with odd coincidence.,"I'd like to apologize ahead of time because I'm not much of a hardware guy so I'll do my best to be descriptive..  
&amp;nbsp;

I got a new comp about a little over a year ago with the following specs:  
Processor - Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz  
Ram - 16 GB  
System Model - MS-7B98  
&amp;nbsp;

Now, About 6 months ago I was getting a problem with a BSOD WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR while playing games. The problem started happening more frequently until I couldn't even get on chrome without crashing into a BSOD. I was still under warranty so I sent it in for repairs where they replaced the CPU and Motherboard with identical models.  
&amp;nbsp;

Cue a week ago, roughly another 6 months after the fact, the same issues are rising again. BSOD while gaming, happening more frequently, ect.  
&amp;nbsp;

I've managed to seemingly stabilize the rate at which it crashes by underclocking my pc.  
&amp;nbsp;

Here is a list of the troubleshooting Iv'e done:   
*Ran software to check temps while gaming, it was all relatively stable.  
*Ran windows memory diagnostics. It came back fine.  
*Ran memtest86 over night, It came back with no issues after 8 full passes.  
*Checked both RAM sticks. They were fine.  
*Updated all drivers.  
*Ran Prime95 on smallest FFT's and got a BSOD in about 5 minutes.  
*Minidump says it's caused by driver ntoskrnl.exe.  
&amp;nbsp;

This leads me to believe it's a faulty CPU. But I'm hesitant to get it replaced because of the coincidence 6 months prior. I mean, what are the odds of getting 2 faulty CPUs in a row?? is it possible that some of the hardware isn't very compatible thus ruining my CPU in about 6 months time?  
I'm no longer under warranty so I want to have more confidence before going out to buy a new CPU, I just don't want the same issue to pop up in another 6 months.  
&amp;nbsp;

EDIT: added result of my minidump from the BSOD's.

Hope yall okay with everything going on.
Yesterday i happen to click on a link, if most of you use discord you mighr have gotten dm'd the same link ,that was sent by a fake twitch bot.It redirected me to discord site where i logged in and stuff and then invited me to a server.


The next day ,i opened my pc to play some league and the game had server issues ( high ms) and some of my friends suggested to download exitlag as it might help me.I download it and suddenly my pc starts stuttering.
By stuttering i mean me trying to move my mouse from one end to the other and it would freeze at some point only to unfreeze a few miliseconds later


After tons of googling, i decided it was a good idea to clean install windows
So i prepared a bootable win 10 usb and clean installed windows


But what do you know the stuttering still persisted
After furthermore research , some BSODs which i can provide screenshots, and tons of random blackscreens on my computer , i gave the matter to my brother to check it out


He tried to identify the issue but he couldnt and believed it might have been an usb input ( headset keyboard mouse etc) that was causing the issue.
After testing that, the issue still persisted.


The weird thing for me is that i tried to play league of legends after reinstalling windows and here's how it went
The game was running smoothly however whenever i alt tabbed the pc would freeze for 2 to 10 seconds and the same happend when i alt tabbed in
If i was on discord in a channel the sound would either space out or bug with them not hearing me and me not hearing them and forcing me to go to options to manual select the input output devices
This could go on for ages


So all in all thank you for reading all this, and before i ask my questions i believe this is a software issue( I own the pc from september 2016):

1) Is this a hardware issue?

2) Is there a chance my hdd (2nd drive ,also have an ssd which windows is installed on) could be at fault?

3)Ive read that it might be an audio driver issue? My brother who happems to be in tech believe its a driver issue but dont know which one

Honestly id love ANY INPUT on how to fix this problem

frg3u6,Hadrae,GPU unstable at 1440p,"Hello, I have a Vega 56  PULSE that I undervolted with stock clocks and OC the Memory, tested with 3D mark, superposition and gaming. Have no Problem at 1080p, but when trying to gaming in 1440p, my pc freezes and crashes, and I have to manually shutdown. I use msi afterburner to keep watch at temps during gaming and Hwinfo64, all temps were ok. 

At first I thought it might be the drivers, so i tested the new ones and old ones and all got me this problem. I eventually stuck in 19.10.1. So decided to tested the Ram, that I have at 3200mhz and the problem persists. Already did a fresh install to.

Finally tryed to reset my undervolt profile and gaming at stock settings, and ""apparently"", the system crashes disappear, I try it about 2h and not a crash. So it is possible that my Undervolt/OC was unstable only at 1440p resolutions?  

Anyone could help me figure this one out?",2,1585525875,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frg3u6/gpu_unstable_at_1440p/,techsupport,1

frg14f,Dolt-Dragoman,New WD Black 6TB HDD throws I/0 error when trying to initialize. Any steps left to check before returning?,"I bought a Western Digital Black 6 TB HDD (WD6003FZBX) to add to my desktop gaming computer.  It's my third HDD, and the last available SATA2 port on my motherboard.  

**Here are my specs:**

* Windows 10 pro x64 bit
* Gigabyte motherboard [Z77-DS3H](https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Motherboard/GA-Z77-DS3H-rev-10/sp#sp)
* Intel Core i5-3570K CPU @ 3.40GHz, stable overclock at I believe 4 GHz (has been for a couple of years now)
* 250 GB SSD (contains OS on 0 SATA3 port)
* 1 TB WD blue HDD (full on 1 SATA3 port)
* DVD multi recorder drive (on 2 SATA2 port)
* 1 TB WD blue HHD (essentially full on 3 SATA2 port)
* 6 TB WD black HHD (on [last] 4 SATA2 port, but failed to initialize) (WD6003FZBX)
* Radeon 7970 GHZ edition GPU (now known as the r9 280x, I believe)

**The error:**

Upon entering Disk Management, it prompts me to initialize the new Disk as GPT or MBR, and I have to choose GPT because it's over 2 TB (my understanding).  

I then get a ""The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error"" message. I also ran the same command through Microsoft Diskpart, but I get the same error.  [Here are pictures of both errors.](https://imgur.com/a/McMMfHi)

**Step I've taken:**

* My SATA cables were also new, so I swapped one with an existing cable for one of my other drives. The existing drive works normally, but I get the same error for the new one.  This rules out cable issues.

* I tried swapping my DVD drive with the new HDD (SATA3 port 1 with SATA2 port 4) to try to test the SATA port itself.  I figured Windows wouldn't be as confused as if I tried that with an HDD, but it was very confused. I received a boot location request immediately as if I had unplugged the SSD.  I have no idea why that happened, but it all worked fine again when I switched it back (except the new drive of course).  Oddly, it did switch the ""Disk 1"" names around seemingly at random, but that did not seem to have any effect on anything.  All the HDDs work fine and the DVD drive still works.  

* I checked that my motherboard drivers are up-to-date, and they are (nothing new since before I bought it).  Windows says everything is up-to-date as well. There apparently aren't any drivers for HDDs. 

I'm thinking if the SATA2 port was bad, Windows wouldn't even see the new drive, right?  Also, that seems less likely than a broken HDD.  I've had zero problems with this motherboard.  

**Question:**

Is there anything else to check or try here?  Or is the only conclusion that the HDD is bad from the factory?  I ordered it from Newegg and it came packed appropriately. It has just sat on my desk in the box until now, and it's been months, so I'm not looking forward to trying to return it.  I'm definitely pretty annoyed if this thing is just broken on arrival. It's supposed to be a high-end drive.

Few minutes ago an e-mail came saying it’s from “Hacker Team” and claiming that they cracked my device after I watched porn in a site. Indeed, I watch it, but who doesn’t? And in the text they are saying that they recorded videos and stuff and they threatened me by saying that they will send these recorded stuff to my contacts if I don’t send them bitcoin. And btw, i watch porn only with my phone.
Now, they didn’t mention any passoword or my name, they didn’t mention any site. Btw, i’m from italy. Can someone please tell me what to do and how should i act?

THE E-MAIL:

You may not know me, and you are probably wondering why you are getting this email, right?
I'm a Hacker who cracked your devices. I setup a malware on the adult video (porn) website and guess what, you visited this site to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching videos, your internet browser started out functioning as a ""HRDP"" - Hidden Remote Desktop Protocol having a keylogger which gave me accessibility to your screen and webcam. After that, my software program obtained all your contacts and files. You entered a password on the websites you visited, and I intercepted it. Of course, you can change it, or already changed it. But it doesn't matter, my malware updated it every time.
 
What did I do?
I generated a backup of your every system (private document files, video, photos, all files).
I created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were watching (you've got a good taste ha ha . . .), and 2nd part shows the recording of your webcam.
Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server)
Do not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.
I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim. This is a hacker code of honor. Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.
 
exactly what should you do?
Well, in my opinion, $ 500 (USD) Dollars is a fair price for our little secret. You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (search ""Bitcoin Wallet"" in Application Store then Download &amp; Install) Make a deposit to your wallet. After that, transfer it to my wallet.",19,1585524545,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frfqeu/i_got_an_email_that_says_i_was_hacked_and_that_i/,techsupport,4

**Asus ROG Strix B450 Mothetboard**

**2x8GB Adata Gammix RAM 3000Mhz**

**Ryzen 5 1600AF**

**MSI GTX 1660 Super Gaming X (Not delivered yet so using girlfriends 780).**

**Samsung 860 EVO SSD**

**Corsair 850RM**

Now  at first I thought it was the motherboard itself, then I put my girlfriends CPU (Ryzen 3 1200) into my PC and after the motherboard lights spent a minute thinking about it, it booted up fine. Then I put  the new 1600AF back in, with no other changes, just a CPU swap, and the problem persisted. I also tried in my girlfriends PC which has an older b350 motherboard etc, but same issue there to, so its nothing to do with cables not connected properly, turning this or that off or an issue with my motherboard. Also her graphics card works fine too. I've  literally tried everything. The pins are perfect, the CPU was completely new and boxed, I just don't understand whats going on? While my PC  booted with ryzen 3 1200, I then updated all the drivers and stuff for the motherboard, and updated the bios itself. I then repeated everything  above, and still same issue. I've tried without GPU, with 1 stick of RAM, switching RAM in other slots, using my girlfriends RAM, taking motherboard battery out,  leaving it to boot up for 5 minutes. No matter what, this white led light just remains on with a black screen the moment the 1600AF is in.

Anyone know what could be the issue? I've built plenty of PCs in past and never had this issue. At this rate I’ll be returning the CPU tomorrow.",0,1585524324,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frfo82/ryzen_1600af_wont_boot/,techsupport,1

* The motherboard standby light turns on solid green.
* The chipset heatsink is warm to the touch (it gets really warm after a few minutes).

frfm49,Haltus_Kain,Is it possible to play a sound file as though it's coming from a mic? [Windows 10],"Wife works in a call center and (finally!!) got approval to work from home due to COVID19. She's all set up and everything's working, but I've heard her give the same 5-second intro at least a hundred times in each shift... which seems nuts to me; why not just record it and press the play button at the start of each call?

Everything's done through the computer, which looks like just a standard copy of Windows 10. No phones or anything.

After some googling, it looks like this can be done by changing the recording device in the sound settings, but experimenting with this on my computer, doing so will silence the mic, which is a no-go.

The computer she's working with is provided by her work, so we can't install anything new - I'm hoping this is a simple enough action that there's just a setting we can tweak or use the ""Open With..."" option to play that file through whatever program handles the mic.

The ideal scenario would be: Call comes in &gt; wife hits the button to play her pre-recorded greeting (which includes asking for customer-specific information) &gt; customer responds, providing their info &gt; wife plugs in the info and carries out the rest of the call normally.

Just those few seconds of automation in each call would add up to a lot of saved words; her job is to literally talk nonstop for 8 hours, so a chance to rest her mouth at the start of each call would hopefully make her hate her job a bit less! (don't work at a call center if you can avoid it -- grateful that she has something, but they really treat her like shit)

I have never ran into any USB related issues before and I've moved several times with this PC. After I set up my computer at my current house, Windows occasionally likes to remind me that there are ""not enough USB controller resources"". I didn't notice any problems arising with any of my USB devices until I realized that I could no longer have my audio coming out of monitor speakers as well as my headphones. I use Voicemeeter Banana to turn on/off whichever output I would like and I have used it since I built my computer years ago with no issues. It looks like I can't use my monitor speakers at all unless I restart my computer and have it be the only output option on Windows. I just can't figure out why I'm having this issue now even though I'm using the same amount of devices I was at my old place. My best guess is that I put different devices into different USB ports and now I don't have the right combination. Not sure if that even makes sense. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Their existing ~100gig hard drive is full so I’m trying to transfer everything to a new 500gig Samsung SSD. That should make all the difference they need. 


It’s my first time working on a laptop like this, please keep things in laymen’s terms. 



the SSD I bought is SATA, so I was told to buy an enclosure so I could plug the SSD into the laptop with a USB cable, then use cloning software to clone. The enclosure I bought is Sabrent SATA to USB. It comes with Acronis True Image cloning software. So I plug the new SSD into the enclosure, plug it into the laptop, all is good. I tried this a month ago and it failed, so today I went into Disk Management and formatted the drive. 


So now it should be empty and ready to go, right?


Well, using Acronis True Image, I open it and click clone drive, find the source (old internal HD) and the destination (new SSD) and begin cloning. 


About 15 minutes in I get this failure. “Failed to read from sector “31.485.192” of hard disk 1. Try to repeats operation. If the error persists, check the disk using check disk utility and create a backup of the desk. Failed to read the snapshot. VSS logs for details. 0x10C481 unknown status 0X9. The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error. 


^ I don’t understand how it helps me to have a backup of the disk, does it mean the original old HD inside there? How does a backup help?


It says “ignore, retry, ignore all, and cancel” I haven’t clicked anything yet, making this thread first. 



I could consider a fresh install but they don’t know where all their files are, I’d prefer a clone if possible. Also, since the new SSD is Samsung (not the old existing internal but the new one) does that mean I could use Samsung’s cloning software? Would that be superior/worth trying instead of Acronis True Image?",15,1585523255,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frfdkk/please_help_me_look_good_for_a_friend_trying_time/,techsupport,0

* Changed the cable to another power input
* Cleaned the dust out of the fan/entire case

What happens is my computer starts freaking out, screen would go black EXCEPT for the task bar at the bottom as if its opening some kind of invisible application. even the ""press alt+Z to experience nvidia geforce overlay"" message would pop up at top right of the screen after the black screen dissapears. after this happens my computer becomes extremely laggy, especially when i have chrome open. when i close chrome i can move mouse around fine, but even opening simple things like pictures start to spike my GPU up to 100% usage for a period of time until it calms down again. What i noticed on task manager is that opening ANY application except for paint seems to spike my GPU usage to 100%. some programs worse than others in terms of how long the lag lasts.

The weird part tho is that if i simply put my computer in sleep mode it clears up the issue, and i will not have any issues at all until it happens randomly again a week or 2 later. This has been happening since January of this year. at this point its really starting to freak me out and annoy me as i put alot of money into this build. is my GPU faulty?

When I go to turn on Bluetooth, it appears the Logitech Controller ""wakes up"", and I end up pairing to it rather than the ASUS module, and my mouse starts acting up. I presume this means the Logitech Controller is taking priority, and treating the game controller as a second mouse - with less than ideal results.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the error i found in event viewer. The description for Event ID 14 from source nvlddmkm cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.

&amp;#x200B;

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.

&amp;#x200B;

The following information was included with the event: 

&amp;#x200B;

frenun,sdgavilan,i7 6700 (non k) not pairing right with a RTX 2060 Super,"Guys, a question: I have an i7 6700 with a 144Hz monitor, 12Gb DDR4 and I upgraded from a GTX 1050ti to a RTX 2060 Super. Nice.

It turns out that in most games I didn’t feel the difference I should have felt in terms of performance. Battlefield 1 for example, with the 1050ti I played a time between 100 and 115 FPS (low, I have recorded) today, with the 2060S I'm taking 80/90 at the low .... Cod Warzone the same thing. I played before at 720p (100%) to get more FPS and I got a beautiful 80/90 FPS. Today, with Super, the same performance. Whats wrong? I know that the 2060 Super is already focused on 1440p resolutions and I play in 1080p, and that I must play in max settings to take fully advantage of the new GPU, but, in my logical understanding, there should also be performance left for 1080p resolutions/low settings. And I also know that with the new card I'm being somewhat limited by the CPU, but still I find it strange not being able to maintain 144 FPS or at least between 100 and 120 which are the minimum updates accepted by the monitor.",2,1585520726,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frenun/i7_6700_non_k_not_pairing_right_with_a_rtx_2060/,techsupport,1

frej13,snizzy_snazz,"Hi, just need some real-time advice on an external drive that's not initializing.","Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 4T WD My Book that I use for my Xbox One X, and a few months ago it just stopped recognizing the drive. I replaced it with another similar drive but I would like to get this one back if possible. I have researched Google and Youtube as well as I know how. I have posted pictures of the drive itself and all the information about that particular model in the dropbox link below. I have also included a recording of the sound it makes.

I realize its likely physically damaged. It does get recognized by both my pc's, it shows up in the device manager and the disk management utilities but it does not initialize and get recognized as a readable drive. This is had been my line of investigation trying to figure it out on my own: First I tried plugging it into my laptop. I did show up as a readable along with the others under My Computer the very first time I plugged it into my laptop. I then unplugged and reconnected it to the xbox to see if something had changed. It had not. The xbox still would not recognize it, and then I plugged it back into the laptop. It has since never initialized on either my laptop or my desktop, both running the latest version of windows 10. The sound on the recording provided has been the sound its made since I realized it was not being recognized by the xbox and it has made that sound the duration of my time trying to fix it. I read some stuff on google saying that it was likely corrupted since there was no way to partition it as is and to use a disk recovery software tool. I tried using Disk Drill and it said it would take almost six  thousand hours even after leaving it overnight. Then I read that that meant it was probably physically damaged. Is there anything to try at this point?

It should be noted that I care nothing about data recovery, as its just all xbox games I own digitally and can be redownloaded as needed. But I would like to fix this one myself if possible. Are there any things to try at home, or is it trash? I saw another youtube video that said often it could be the sata bridge card but the sound the drive makes would leave me to believe its mechanical within the drive, yes? Whats your advice, reddit? The only thing that gives me hope is the fact that it did appear to initialize the first time I plugged it into my laptop last night.

freg9d,ThatBoredTechGuy,HDD Noises,"Hello there,

Last year my PC passed away during a house moving. Many components inside the case ended up bent over and broken. Fatal. I had to build a new computer.

I checked the hard drives health at work, and although one seemed on it's way to die the rest seemed fine.

Just recently I acquired an HDD Dock Station. My plan was to copy over the dying HDD's data and use my old SSDs and HDDs from there until I had enough time to put them inside my rig.

I connected my biggest HDD and noticed it's doing quite profound noises whenever I do anything.

I never had a connected HDD so near me so I wonder if this is normal and back then my Fractal Define case kept the noise to minimum or if, instead, I should worry about this noise.

I updated everything I can find (windows and bluetooth drivers). The PC tower sits on the desk behind the monitor so the distance between these devices and the PC tower is about half a meter.

This is what seems to work ok:
- the devices settings window can find the bluetooth adapter to enable/disable bt
- devices can be paired successfully (tested with headphones and keyboard)

All seems ok, then:
- keyboard: pressing the window key sometimes opens the start menu, typing text has a huge delay and a buffer that holds what's being typed and then dumps it out. Sometimes it loses keystrokes
- headphones: impossible to use as the audio stutters all the time

free3p,Drawleks,Port Forwarding on my router doesn't seem to work.,"Hi reddit,I have been trying to set up my Minecraft server to host so I can play with my friends. I want to host it on my pc. I have done it countless time, but I have a different router this time, and I think the problem is coming from here.

I have the Huawei B315s-22. I have forwarded my 25565 port in both tcp and udp, choosing the lan IP address of the PC I'm hosting minecraft on.I have forwarded them thanks to the ""Virtual server"" service.My minecraft server works from localhost, but using my public ip address didn't work to connect on it.

I then have used this website : [https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) to see if my 25565 port is open and it's telling me it is not.

I have tried to disable the firewall from my router but it didn't change anything.

After giving up, I have tried using hamachi to make things easier, but even after creating my network and my friends joining it, they were still not able to enter my server with the local Ip address from hamachi.I have tried with and without firewall enabled and it never changed anything.

If any of you has any other possible solution I would gladly try. (I really don't want to host my minecraft server on a website as I always had the possibility to do it myself and I'd rather have full control over it)

fred4x,Pantelis94,PC's secondary TV via HDMI (suddenly stopped working),"Hey there,

I have connected my TV (LG42LA660S) with my computer via DVI (Graphics Card) to HDMI (TV) and everything worked fine from the first plug in until it suddenly when I closed the TV stopped working and now is not recognized by neither the computer nor the TV indicating no signal.

Manually detecting doesn't pop up anything either. Drivers are updated. I've literally tried everything posted online from removing the cables to checking the power source to my GPU. Still nothing.

This is the second time this has happened, first with an HDMI (Graphics card) to HDMI (TV) which also worked from plug in and then suddenly stopped.

frdxa5,AdanixDesigns,custom PC black screen after boot and windows login - NVIDIA GPU,"
Hello guys,

Just recently I finished my first custom build and I have already run into some trouble with it.

Since the second day of usage I am experiencing this weird issue where the screen has input for the boot logo and windows login but after showing the desktop for some seconds the screen goes completely black.

This always seems to happen the first few times I start my PC in a day, so after the PC not being powered for a long time. The issue goes away after multiple forced restarts or by reinstalling the NVIDIA drivers.

When this happens I also hear the windows notification sound and when the issue is finally gone I see the message “display driver failed to start; using microsoft default driver instead”.

For the rest my GPU seems to be working completely fine.

In the device manager I see some PCI devices listed under other devices with yellow circles with exclamation marks. These PCI devices should normally belong to my GPU.

I have also experienced these blackout is BIOS which makes me believe this is a problem with the motherboard, possibly a loose contact?


My PC specs are:

GPU: RTX 2080ti
Motherboard: ASROCK x570m PRO4
CPU: Ryzen 9 3950x
SSD: Samsung EVO 970
RAM: Ripjaws V DDR4-3200 2x16GB
PSU: Corsair RM750

I hope that I can soon resolve this annoying issue!

It was the only new drive that showed up after the installment (and the only one I installed) and I didn't find this ""issue"" anywhere on the internet. Well, I made this post because I thought that maybe I got another drive than the one I paid for. Even though it has more storage, it might be lower quality hardware and more prone to issues. So I thought maybe someone more knowledgeable than me will know about this and I might have accidentally got another drive than what I ordered. Or maybe I'm just lucky.

p.s: the drive had a sticker on it and the box was closed properly.",9,1585516872,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/frdkv1/a_new_m2_drive_appears_in_windows_with_more/,techsupport,1

A quick question about hardware, I got an nvme ssd, an other ssd, and a not so big HDD.

I was thinking about buying an other HDD (in the near future) to stock solo games (my internet is not very fast...)

Is there any advantage buying one of those hybrid HDD like the Firecuda ? Will I have faster loading times than with the ""basic"" HDD or the interest is just to put windows on it and make it faster ?

frdj84,CBA_Honestly,Random FPS Drops in CSGO with dual monitor," 

I just bought a 144hz monitor for my desktop. I have that as my main monitor with a displayport and I took my old tv I was using and connected that via HDMI as my second monitor. Normal PC usage everything is running smooth. When I play CSGO, my FPS is capped to 144 (i'm assuming g-sync does this because I don't have it capped in my config) - the only issue is that for some reason almost every game I play my fps just suddenly tanks to 20. Restarting the client fixes the issue. I haven't been able to diagnose any specific cause for the fps drop.

Drivers are up to date

Running fullscreen windowed

Notes: New monitor is using G-SYNC, and my 2nd monitor isnt G-SYNC compatible - maybe that has something to do with it?

Specs if thats helpful

GPU: RTX 2080

CPU: 3900x 12 core

32 gigs of ram etc.

After it was finished I found my graphics card (details listed at the end) was no longer being recognised.It no longer appears in device manager in the adaptors section or in any other, and it has been set to view hidden devices.It no longer appears in any autodriver update programs (never used it before today but thought it may be worth a shot).It also does not appear in geforce experience, as well as any drivers I try to install failing to install due to not having the correct gpu.Currently my pc is using the basic ""Microsoft Basic Display Adaptor"" which is pretty much useless for my kind of work.I tried looking through the bios, which seems the graphics card isn't even showing up there, though I may have made a mistake.

Any idea what I should do?

Symptoms-

Yesterday my pc stopped booting past the first beep ( gigabyte z87-ud3h Mobo, i7 4770 processor) . I decided to open it up and check. Upon popping open the cpu out of its socket, I found the pins to be a bit misaligned, with some thermal paste at some places, due to earlier attempts to get it on the cpu,  pic attached of the cpu socket ([https://imgur.com/a/urrH3bL](https://imgur.com/a/urrH3bL)). I need your help in order to find out how to get past this. Following are the possible resolutions i'd thought up to the problem-

1) Buy a new mobo with the lga1150 socket that the 4770 uses, if so, what would be a good alternative, to the gigabyte z87-ud3h? Does gigabyte still make these, and can i get them in India?

2) Fix the misaligned cpu pins, if so, how bad do you guys reckon the damage is, and how could i go about fixing/cleaning it up?

I appreciate any and all help I can get, this PC is 6 yrs old at this point, and holds quite the sentimental value to me, as I gamed my highschool away on this thing. What I wouldn't give to get it working again!

The problem manifests itself in a couple of different ways, the most common is when loading up/alt-tabbing out of a game, particularly league of legends. My screen will turn black for a few seconds, and eventually show me my screen with all my windows open but my mouse will stop moving intermittently, and when it does move most things don't react. My computer will stay in this state until I restart it. In this state, every time I try to open/close any program, my computer and mouse freeze up for around 15 seconds before opening the program.

After switching league of legends to borderless mode, the problem manifested itself by my game/mouse freezing about 20 minutes into a game. I pressed alt-tab and after about 30 seconds the game closed and my computer was now in its freeze-every-so-often state.

I have tried a memtest for my RAM and had no errors and my PSU has plenty wattage for my computer.

frc0p5,Gwiz220,Huge WindowsApps Folder Refuses to Die.,"So a little bit of backstory. I had been having some issues with windows for a few weeks, random security check failures, video crashes, stuff like that. I have 2 separate drives to house my OS and my actual storage, so I decided to format my OS drive and reinstall. It works much better now, even though appdata went with it, so i had to reinstall a few things. Luckily nothing was lost.  


However, after experimenting around with the Gamepass the last few months, I had about 300gbs of games installed from the Xbox app into a folder on my storage drive. All of those games were stored into the Windows-provided folder named ""WindowsApps"". And now theres 2 WindowsApps folders. And one of them is 300gbs big. On my primary storage drive. And I can't delete or replace it.  


I've scoured the internet for the past 3 days, going to shady looking websites (safely) just trying to find some tips or programs I could use to destroy this file:

* Tried changing ownership of the folder and folders within, through both properties and command prompt. WindowsApps would let me change ownership, however all folders inside would not let me. Clicking ""Change"" on ownership would reload the window and grey out the button, as well as the ""edit permissions"" button.
* I tried unlocker, lockhunter, AND fileassassin. No dice. All of them said the files couldn't be unlocked. Even on restart.
* I tried force deleting through command prompt, nope, need permission from System.
* Safe mode? Nope, same thing.
* Safe mode with command prompt? Nope, same thing.
* Zipping up the folder in 7zip and then choosing to delete the original, Nope, can't zip up something I don't own.

Using command prompt, I managed to force ownership on 3 of the 10 game folders contained inside. However the greyed out buttons continue to appear when I try changing the permissions. And instead of needing permission from System to change the folder, I now need permission...

From myself. 

^(I tried saying ""Permission Granted"" into the microphone, but for some reason it wouldn't listen.)

This folder and its contained files pertain to absolutely nothing on my fresh OS, windows won't detect it as a WindowsApps folder, and will in fact claim that it's corrupted due to missing files. So it's basically 300gbs of windows protected trash, and my PC has now run out of space.

frblho,AlwaysSeekingHarmony,Trouble Upgrading Laptop Memory,"Hey everybody, new to the community. If this should be posted elsewhere please just let me know.

With everybody spending a lot more time on their electronic devices these days my parents and I decided to do a badly overdue upgrade of the memory on my mother's laptop. None of us are experts by any means, FYI. As best as we could determine she had a HP 15 series laptop [with the following specs](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05829258), although having opened the thing up ourselves I can testify that those specs are at least somewhat incorrect, with her having 2x 2GB sticks of RAM instead of 1x4GB.

We ordered what we thought would be a simple upgrade, [16 GB of DDR4 2133 SODIMM memory](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D2W7D9R/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_tEoGEb4X277KW). Again, not an expert on this end, let me know if I should be providing more or different information. We ordered the memory, it showed up this morning, and we opened up the laptop only to find that the new memory was ""in the wrong shape"", for lack of a better way to put it. It doesn't fit into the laptop's memory slots, the indentation in between the two groups of pins is in the wrong place. Obviously it's probably also the wrong type of memory and we don't want it to fit anyways.

[Old memory still in place](https://imgur.com/rYmkfs9)

[Old memory next to new memory, old is green and new, incorrect type is black](https://imgur.com/5EAWOxI)

frb3xa,BlooNoob30,Can't update BIOS on ASRock AB350M Pro4,"For the past two hours I've been attempting to update my computer's BIOS. I've formatted two different USB drives to FAT32 numerous times, plugged them into the USB 2.0 ports and put in the updated BIOS version into the USB. Yes, I unzipped the file and put the raw file inside. I've been at this and I'm very frustrated that it's still not working. 

My main reason for updating is that while playing COD Warzone, my Ryzen 3 1200 will endure major lag spikes from a constant ~60fps down to 20-30fps every five seconds. I was hoping that updating the BIOS would help as I've read online that ASRock motherboards are known to be rather finnicky with performance. Of course, now I realize I can't even update it since every time I select Instant Flash in the Tools menu at Post, it says No Image File Detected.

Another weird thing is that the UEFI Version states ""AB350M Pro4 P3.30"" but the latest version on ASRock for this motherboard is only 2.20.

frazmr,emmaspeedy,FPS problem due to HIGH CPU usage,"Hi everybody ! So here is the problem.  I  made a PC like 3/4 years ago and i never had problems so far. I decided to buy a Corsair all-in-one water-cooler H0100i Platinum. I Installed it and everything looked fine the temperature was stable and  everything. 

But now when i play league,for example, i have some fps drops not much but enough to be annoying and can be unplayable in some rare occasions. I played a couple  of games with a temps thingy Afterburner Rivatuner for OGD( On-Game-Display) to watch my CPU and here is what i saw 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TEST #1

I launch League of Legends in a Practice Tool Mode with all my normal start-up programs that I chose

\- Windows Defender  
\- RealTek HD audio Manager  
\- Overwolf (LoL overlay)  
\- MSI Afterburner  
\- Logitech G-HUB  
\- Corsair ICUE  
\- Razer Synapse  
\- Nvidia Experience  
\- RivaTuner  


The in-game results are :  


\*degrees Celcius

\- GPU TEMP : avg 40 and avg 20% load  
\- CPU TEMP : avg 45 and avg 90/100% load

With this setup, if i add Discord while playing, I'll suffer of FPS instability and people will hear me lag on discord.  


TEST #2

I launch League of Legends in a Practice Tool Mode with close background programs

\- Windows Defender  
\- RealTek HD audio Manager  
\- MSI Afterburner  
\- Logitech G-HUB  
\- RivaTuner

With this setup, if i add Discord while playing, I won't suffer of FPS instability and people will hear perfectly fine on Discord

My issue here is that I have NEVER suffer from CPU problems up to now. Before, i could play LoL with Overwolf to record my games/plays without problems but now I have to run the game only so i can enjoy it WHY.

Power: Corsair RM 850x  


P.S : I tried to see if i had some Bloatware running and i didn't see anything abnormal, I updated my BIOS and didn't fix the problem, My drivers are updated

So my question : what could be possibly be the problem?

fraze2,Lucetti,Computer crashing with black screen and (gpu?) fan revving.,"My computer has decided to shit itself, which is not ideal now that I’m forced to online classes. The issue started when I was playing divinity 2, wherein it would hard lock to a black screen and the fans, which I’m about 99% sure are the gpu fans, would kick on to max.

I powered it on and off from the power button, and it did it again. After about 4 times over 3 days, it has gotten way worse. It started doing it when I for example loaded steam or opened a screenshot of something on reddit. It now won’t even boot into windows without doing it. It goes to bios but either crashes while trying to load into windows or crashes shortly after.

The progressive nature of the problem is confusing and due to coronavirus I’m having trouble finding anywhere to take it and would like to just fix it myself if possible.

I’m thinking it’s got to be the gpu but I don’t know. I guess could be a motherboard problem or a problem with the voltage/power supply.  Very troubled.

The gpu is a Radeon rx 580, the power supply is thermal lake smart series 600 watt, and the mb is a an ASUS x470 plus.",0,1585507898,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fraze2/computer_crashing_with_black_screen_and_gpu_fan/,techsupport,1
frayov,YME2019,PC lag without full utilization,"So my PC is lagging heavily, but Task Manager doesn't show full utilization of the CPU, RAM, or GPU. (I'm running CAD programs, but sometimes this happens in games as well)

That's what is strange to me. It just doesn't seem like my machine is using its whole capacity. It does the same thing with games. I thought that the problem could be with the HDD, but it doesn't show full utilization either. I'm stumped.

I downlad the last driver from nvdia web (v. 445.75) and plug the gpu through hdmi directly to my smart tv and everything goes well. I can run the games with all the graphics in high.

My pc had a problem where it would not play minecraft without restarting randomly but i could play all other games fine. This really bothered me as I decided to put a decent amount of money into my build so I could play any game I want for the next while.

My system is: 5700XT Red Devil, Ryzen 3600, B450 Tomahawk MAX, 650W EVGA power supply, 16GB Corsair Vengeance.

I tried everything, MEMTEST86, removing one ram stick at a time, trying different ram slots etc etc with no luck. My temps are fine on GPU and CPU. I could stress test the system with no crash, so I decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 from a usb.

While installing windows 10, I kept getting blue screens during the installation stage and I figured out the only way I could stop the blue screens for long enough to install Windows was to constantly move my mouse around(weird, I know).
Finally got windows installed and boom, before I even install any drivers, BSOD.

I AGAIN re-installed windows but same result. The thing is I can boot into safe mode and no crashes, does anyone have any idea what’s going on? Faulty MB? CPU? I’m desperate",1,1585507568,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fraw0l/pc_keeps_restarting/,techsupport,1

Our area is notoriously known for being a service dead zone and having very limited wifi options.

(granted I haven't actually talked to a person, I've only used their online ""availability"" map. Areas literally a mile away from us are able to get reliable internet, so maybe if I talk to an actual rep, they would be able to find a signal???)

Currently, we have Consolidated Communications DSL as our internet provider. They offer us a maximum of 10mbps down for our internet. Overall, it's decent, but it's very unreliable and drops connections all the time. Our household is somewhat tech-heavy; we like to stream frequently on our devices. Being a gamer myself, I can rarely play my online games due to the amount of lag.

My question is, what can I do? Are we just screwed because of our home location? We have looked into satellite internets, like HughesNet, but their service was actually slower than our current internet provider.

MOBO: ASUS ROG STRIX X570-E GAMING

PSU: Corsair RM650X

""*The Phanteks Eclipse P400A ATX Mid Tower Case supports video cards up to    420mm long, but video cards over 280mm may block drive bays.

fracgm,bibicicimici,did I fry my cpu/mobo?,"hello. I must start by saying I'm not that great with computers and my hardware knowledge is quite limited.

my laptop is MSI GL62MVR 7RFX. about 2-3 days ago I was playing sims 4 and noticed my laptop was getting really hot so I turned on the cooler boost which did cool it down but not that much. I must've played for around one hour, or maybe one hour and a half, and then I turned it off right after I got out of the game. the next day I turned it on but it wouldn't boot up, it only showed the MSI logo without any spinning dots. I plugged it in, turned it off from the power button, unplugged it, turned it on again and plugged it back in and after around one minute it worked. I thought that was pretty weird since it never happened before but I didn't pay too much attention because the next time I turned it on it booted up just fine.

yesterday I didn't use my laptop at all, and today when I turned it on the same problem appeared, plus my battery was completely drained after a day in which I haven't used it at all. I got it to boot up by using the method mentioned earlier but now I observed a new problem.

I charged it all the way and then unplugged it but the battery dropped to 59% so I plugged it back in to get it to 100%. when it was full, I unplugged, battery drained normally to 90% after which it suddenly dropped to 60%, drained normally to 59% and got stuck for I think like an hour. now it's going down but quite rapidly considering I'm on power saving mode, it's draining by 1% every 2-3 minutes. the estimated time remaining that the battery shows was messed up too; it went from around 2hrs to 1hr while the percentage was the same.

I have never ever had problems with the battery on this laptop and the battery light on the laptop doesn't show any problems, it's blue when it's charging (not flashing or anything) and off when it's not. I looked around and found some people with the same problem of not booting up but not the battery thing. if I didn't have the booting problem I would just think I need to calibrate the battery, but now I'm super scared I fried the CPU or motherboard from the gaming session. the laptop is quite new, I have it since July and never had any problems with it and it would be SUCH a shame if I did any damage by playing sims....... so I guess my questions are: should I worry? and is there anything I can do to fix the booting/battery thing?",1,1585505627,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fracgm/did_i_fry_my_cpumobo/,techsupport,1

fra9ta,srcircle,Random Blue Screens Even After Clean Reinstall.," 

About  a week ago, I started getting random system crashes. They are  relatively intermittent (maybe once every few hours) and they have  different crash messages each time. The first time I assumed it was just  a fluke and ignored it. After it happened a few times I started  troubleshooting. Since I couldn't find a single source for the error I  reinstalled Windows (leaving files). However, later that day, I got  another BSOD. And another. I obviously hadn't fixed the problem. I clean  reinstalled from scratch, but I was still getting Blue Screens. They're  still happening and I am at a loss for what to do. If someone could  help that would be great.

Here's what I have already tried:

* Reinstalling Windows
* Running a Memory Diagnostic (It ran both passes w/o errors)
* sfc /scannow passed with no errors
* chkdsk (write/read mode as well as read-only) pass with no errors on any drives

The only things that changed around that time (that I can think of) is that I:

* Upgraded my ram (1x8 -&gt; 2x8) and boot SSD (860 EVO -&gt; 970 EVO)
* switched from Chrome to Firefox
* Moved some of my files to a Samba share

Crash logs and such are in comments.

I'm starting to get a little desperate and I'm not sure what to do.",7,1585505375,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fra9ta/random_blue_screens_even_after_clean_reinstall/,techsupport,1
fra9qg,Star_Muncher,New computer gets extremely laggy and then black screens after continuous use,"I built a new PC recently.   
The only things I reused were   
my GPU (RTX 2070),   
my RAM (Corsair Vengeance, 16 gigs),   
and my Power Supply.   


For the new pieces: 

I got a new cooler (Noctua D15),   
a new CPU (Ryzen 9 3900),   
and a new motherboard (Gigabyte Aorus Elite Wifi).  


Ever since I put it together, I get some unbearable lag. If I try and run anything, my pc usually black screens, forcing me to reset it. CPU temps when turning back on show it to be dropping from \~50c, so it's likely not overheating. I ran memory diagnostics, and both my memory sticks were reported to be okay. The only exception to this was if I turned on XMP, and then they returned as faulty (along with a number of other issues). I have tried to make sure my Drivers are updated. I got the latest Nvidia drivers, and installs the drivers for my motherboard.   
I reinstalled Windows, kept my old files on a separate HDD, did a Malwarebytes scan, nothing came up. Eventually, I removed my HDD entirely, running everything off my M2. Turned off XMP, which giving me blue screens when I ran games. Then, it appeared to be working fine. But then, this morning, I got the same horrendous lag, and my PC black screened when I tried to open up a diagnostic tool. The background programs running are the same ones on my old PC, and I had 0 issues on that one. It would stay on for weeks on end without showing any issues. My new PC gets like this overnight.   


I'm not sure what the issue is at this point. The only things that come to mind are that I either messed something up building the PC, or one of the parts I brought over from my old PC is faulty, and causing failures.",0,1585505367,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fra9qg/new_computer_gets_extremely_laggy_and_then_black/,techsupport,1

It takes me about 10ish hours to fully download ARK from the MS store, and I've had to do that twice while troubleshooting so I really don't want to have to do it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I have tried:

Disabling Anti-Virus

Full Rebooting

Updating windows 10 (I did install the update BTW)

Signing into the store &amp; installing ARK on my brothers PC which is on the same WiFi (it worked).

Giving Windows Store full permissions in settings--&gt;apps &amp; features--&gt;Store (gave access to everything: mic, camera, background apps, etc.)

Restarting Wifi Modem then Completely Removing &amp; Re-downloading ARK (Took 10 hours- and I have friends waiting on me to play!)

Installing apps other than ARK (they don't install either)

&amp;#x200B;

Running this powershell as admin:

Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ""$($\_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml""}

Then running this CMD as admin:

PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command ""&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}

&amp;#x200B;

Turning off every non-windows process &amp;non-essential startup process in task manager

Reinstalling the Microsoft Store

And A LOT of other things I forgot

&amp;#x200B;

I have followed every tutorial on YouTube that says it will ""fix error code0x80070005 in the Store"", but none of them do.

Anyways after 30 minutes i was sure that my system is still stable and will just work, most likely not with the best performance but whatever.

i played some games until i wanted to restart my pc after installing couple more games.

then it didn't boot. it hung itself up in the gigabyte bios post screen. so i've reset the system 2-3 times till it booted. as i found this behiavor quite comical i shut the pc down and put a beeper into my system.

system boots, beeps one short beep, seems to post, hungs up in the gigabyte screen. reset 2-3 times it starts.

i've browsed the web and manual regarding the aorus m b450 and tried to find some error codes or LEd codes or whatever, but couldn't find any.

now i sit here, my pc is running, performance seems still to be subpar, but okayish and i have no idea whats wrong with my system.

Then it would reconnect and be fine. This was infrequent. 

Specs: 
Samsung S9+
Andriod 10
6 GB Ram

I am sometimes able to use chrome to google something on Wifi, but apps such as Twitter and Tumblr and Netflix will not work at all, ever. Sometimes when I am connected to the wifi, the wifi symbol at the top of my screen seems to indicate it is working normally, but the wifi still doesn't work. Other times, a little exclamation point will appear next to the wifi symbol.


I am the only person in my family with this phone. Everyone else has an iPhone, except for my sisters boyfriend who has a 1+ (he is living for us during quarantine). They have no issues connecting, and neither does any of our computers (we have macs and PCs). 

It's just my phone. I have tried everything I can think of, and somethings suggested by troubleshooting tutorials online. I was able to sucessfully connect to my moms phone as a hotspot, but not our wifi. I would try going somewhere else to see if I could get their wifi, but that's hard right now. 

Here's what I have tried:

-turned my phone on and off again
-forgot our wifi network then rejoined
-reset network settings
-wiped the cache parition 
-reset our router
-checked for software updates (its up to date) 
-reset app permissions 
-deleted newly installed apps in case one was messing with the connection
-checked the devices ""health"" and for malware

I am really happy with it, the only thing that drives me crazy is the CPU Fan Speed CONSTANTLY changing, it seems to happen at around 105°.

When it happens, it doesn't change by much, just enough that the annoying whirring of the AMD stock cooler really sticks out against the rest of my PC. 

I already know about CPU fan smoothing but my BIOS doesn't seem to have that option at all, and I'm already on the latest BIOS. Another option would maybe be to switch the stock fan with my bequiet case fan, I'm not even sure if that's possible though, it looks like it might be the same size.

On the first evening the issue began, it was perfectly capable of running Overwatch until I switched to Apex Legends with a couple friends. It worked fine for about 5 minutes until rainbow coloured artifacts began appearing around the screen. About a minute of that and the system froze entirely, requiring a hard reset to continue. Further attempts at launching Apex Legends or any other game, including Overwatch, results in either a crash to desktop or complete lock up requiring a hard reset either immediately after loading the main menu or within 5-10 minutes.

The thing that confuses me the most about this is that it works perfectly fine for everything BUT games. Any sort of browsing, media streaming, or my work from home applications have no issues.

Over the week, I've run tests with the following list of games that were working normally before this began and found them all to be crashing or locking up. I'll also list any game-specific errors in case those help:

Overwatch - Upon crash, displays an error message stating ""Your rendering device has been lost""

Distance - Upon crash, produces an error log file that states ""d3d11.dll caused an Access Violation (0xc0000005) in module d3d11.dll at 0023:70e96b9e.""

Apex Legends

Battle Brothers

After a game crashes, there are a few things that I get in the Windows Event Viewer System Logs as well:
Warnings that state ""Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."" (Source: Display, Event ID: 4101)
A series of errors from Source: nvlddmkm, first one with EventID: 14 and then several with EventID: 13.
They all start with the usual ""The description for Event ID 14 from source nvlddmkm cannot be found."" blurb followed by the following unique segments:

For the ID 14: \Device\Video3 20c7(3180) 00000000 00000000

For the ID 13s I get three different errors that repeat with the numbers incrementing or changing:

\Device\Video3 Graphics SM Warp Exception on (GPC 1, TPC 0, SM 0): Illegal Instruction Encoding

\Device\Video3 Graphics SM Global Exception on (GPC 1, TPC 0, SM 0): Multiple Warp Errors

Here's my current build:
PSU:	SeaSonic FOCUS Plus Gold 850W

MoBo: EVGA Z390 FTW

CPU: Intel Core i9-9900KF 3.6GHz 8 Core

RAM: G.SKILL TridentZ Series 64GB DDR4 3600

Video Card: Asus ROG Strix RTX2070 OC Gaming

OS Drive: Intel 660p M.2 512GB

App Drive: Western Digital Black SN750 1TB

Storage Drives: Western Digital Blue 4TB WD40EZRZ x2

Monitor: Benq GL2760H

OS: Windows 10 Version 10.0.17763 Build 17763


It's also worth stating that I have zero over clocking in place beyond what was done by manufacturers.

So far, I've done the following to try and resolve this with no resolution:

-Update video drivers. Latest version 445.75 were used.

-Use DDU in safe mode to remove existing display drivers and return to V432.00 included in Windows 10

-Monitor temperatures using SpeedFan - nothing goes anywhere above 50-60C during crash

-Move monitor cable to different HDMI port

-Move video card to second PCI-E slot

-Replace video card with older known good card, again testing both PCI-E slots

-Test known good video card with multiple driver versions

-Replace power supply with older known good PSU of same wattage

-Ensure that there are two separate cables from PSU to each power port in video card

-Reset BIOS settings to factory defaults

-Ensure latest version of BIOS is installed - it already is.

-Run Windows Memory test - no faults found

-Remove all but a single memory module. Test different modules in different slots

-Use Debug Mode in NVIDIA Control Panel

-Use checkdsk on C: drive

-Windows System File Checker to repair system files - no faults found

-Reformat C: drive and reinstall Windows 10. Install only windows updates, Steam

-Include driver update to clean install. Only install drivers - no PhysX or GeForce Experience, etc.


At this point I'm out of ideas of my own and those that I've managed to find by trawling the internet for old threads with these same error messages aside from replacing the motherboard which I have no compatible replacements for. I honestly can't tell at this point whether its a software or hardware issue given that reformatting and replacing all potential hardware issues with known good parts resolve nothing.

fr9s4j,racingmc,Boot loop problem," So I can't for the life of me fix this problem. I thought I was a pretty smart guy, but I guess I was mistaken. My PC is about 3 months old. Was working great until about a month ago. As soon as the windows logo (or windows repair logo) appears, the computer reboots. I can get into the bios just fine and stay in the bios as long as I want. Running WIN10

Parts List and what I've attempted:

Asus Tuf Gaming x570 plus WIFI (put a brand new one in today as a last ditch effort) BIOS is latest version. Speaking of the BIOS, I've disabled secure boot, removed all other drives from the boot priority except the USB, and deleted all the boot keys. It seems that the system ignores my USB.

AMD 3700x

GSkill ram (Ive tried plugging in only one at a time)

2080 pro video card 

Sata HD (unplugged it and added a NVME drive as well, because why not try everything)

Kratos p650g power supply (changed to a rm850x)

2 different USB sticks made with the windows creation tool (thought maybe one was bad). Made another last night and tested in another computer. Works fine and can boot into the windows install screen.

The BIOS sees all of my drives, my memory, and CPU. Everything looks perfect. Even the self check on the SATA drive from the BIOs comes back good.

No matter if I boot to the USB or the HD, as soon as the windows logo appears, it reboots.

OS: Win 10

CPU: i7 4790K

GPU: GTX 980Ti

RAM: 32GB KINGSTON DUAL-DDR3 1600MHz

PSU: CORSAIR 750W CS SERIES MODULAR 80 PLUS

So I followed the advice from my [previous question](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fn11da/computer_not_booting_after_restart_command/) and bought a new SSD for my ASUS Z97-P motherboard - the [Samsung 970 EVO Plus](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-V7S500BW-Solid-State-Drive/dp/B07MFBLN7K). I want to use this SSD to boot from, so used EaseUS Todo Backup to clone my OS from the old SSD to the new one. However I can't get it to boot from this new SSD.

I've gone into the BIOS and there's no entry against the M.2 drive, it says N/A. However the 970 *is* being recognised sometimes - if I go into Boot Mode and select the drive it seems to boot from there (although I could be wrong) but doesn't have a P in front of it like the SATA drive (although I think this might be normal?) I've also had a look for any PCI-e settings in the BIOS (as I read that this will need to be enabled) but can't find any definitive enable/disable settings, nor any PCI-e settings in the Onboard Devices Configuration of the Advanced boot settings. I've also tried disabling the CSM but that didn't work (it wouldn't boot anything), as well as changing the storage boot options to UEFI only.

I haven't unplugged my current SSD from the motherboard yet, as I've heard conflicting things about whether or not this is necessary.

So I guess what I'm asking is, can I reliably boot from this SSD, and if so what am I doing wrong? I know I could just buy another [SATA SSD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-MZ-76E500B-EU-Solid-State/dp/B078WQT6S6) but would like to try and get this working if at all possible.

The next morning my computer would not even post. I had to reseat the card and in doing so some of the RAM. It booted but had artifacts all over the screen. It starts in the taskbar. Sometimes the screen will go black for 5 to 10 seconds and will be several second before the artifacts start up again. Also, I am now getting notifications that Firefox is being denied access to the graphics hardware and the artifacts get worse when I use it. When it reboots from DDU and I have just installed Radeon drivers, the adrenaline window and task bar artifact first.

My computer is an old Dell with an i7 3770 and 16G of RAM.

All uninstalls of the drivers from this point was done using DDU.

I reinstalled them several times (20.3.1). Artifacts. (This step I did multiple times and even in between some of the later steps.)

I installed the WHQL drivers (20.2.2). Artifacts

I went back to the previous drivers that I had been using (September). Artifacts.

I booted up my Linux partition, Ubuntu 18.04. Artifacts so bad I can barely do anything.

I boot to a Live USB of Ubuntu 18.04. Artifacts so bad I can barely do anything.

I figure that something must be wrong with the card. Maybe when the drivers installed it did something to the BIOS of the card. I used Techpowerup's Bios collection to try and flash it. But it says that it is already installed and just quits.

In all of the uninstalling and reinstalling of the drivers I realized that it was not displaying artifacts when I didn't have drivers installed. With no drivers I had no artifacts and was able to play Particle Fleet Emergence for a few hours before my computer crashed (not sure if it was related, no artifacts first). Linux Live USB seemed to work fine without the drivers installed on Windows. I thought that was a bit weird.

Took the card out and used the integrated graphics while the AMD drivers are not installed. Works fine. I will test if having the drivers installed but using the integrated graphics makes a difference and will update.

I also hope to find a spare drive and with a fresh install of Windows 10 see what happens when I install the drivers.

fr96a1,Dewbydan,Unexpected Crashing While Gaming,"Morning Friends,

I am having some consistent crashing issues (specifically while gaming) which is definitely harshing my quarantine mellow. Essentially what happens is I will be able to play any given game anywhere between 2 and 30 minutes before my computer will crash. When it crashes the screen will typically go completely white (or bright purple in some cases) and become unresponsive. Typically sound will continue to work but the computer needs to be hard reset after. Occasionally it will kick back a CPU Fan error and I will have to boot from the bios. When it crashes the CPU fan will stop spinning for a bit and then kick back on again. I've ran it with temp checks going and the CPU/GPU are not overheating.

It typically will crash when it has to do something graphically intensive in a less than optimized game. IE Doom 2016 runs without a hitch but Vermintide 2 dies when I try to use a flamehthrower.

fr9055,Kirkoid,What's the best processor I can get for a Pegatron AP480C-S motherboard?,"So I was given these two old school computers (RM Ecoquiet 780), as they didn't work, and hadn't done for years. Two cheap CMOS batteries later, and they were working, albeit with Windows XP. Stuck at home in the lockdown, I decided to see how far I could take one of them (I'm not really very experienced at this). Windows 10 installed but ran slowly, so I replaced the HDD with a 120GB SSD (£20 on Amazon). The results were surprisingly good. I then took the RAM from the other machine to give this one a total of 8GB. Even better. I then replaced the CPU with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 2.6GHz Dual-Core CPU I got for £10 on eBay (it did have 1.6GHz single core), and it was now running better than my wife's laptop, which it has now replaced. I've also put an  NVIDIA GeForce GT730 2GB graphics card in.

So the MB manual says;

CPU:

* Socket AM2 - AMD Athlon64/ Sempron/ Athlon 64 X2/ AM2+CPU/ Phenom
* HT3 (Socket AM2+ with RS780C, up to 5.2 GT/s)
* HT1 (Socket AM2 with RS780C, 2.0 &amp; 1.6 GT/s)

What's the best CPU I can pop in this thing to finish it off? Thanks in advance.

If I turn the speakers all the way up I can hear some pretty loud muffled sounds/static, and it doesn't seem like the inputs are picking up sound from any instruments either, as I've tried playing them though the interface with the gain all the way up and the signals aren't clipping.

fr8piw,DynamicArrow,Motherboard and RAM help,"Good day all,

I have a z77 MPower (MS-7751) motherboard with 8gb ddr3 RAM and a GTX 1060 3GB GPU. I play games from time to time and I have noticed a lot of lag from the new Call of Duty Warzone. After some research I believe that it is my lack of RAM that is giving me the lag problems in Call of Duty. However, my motherboard only supports ddr3 RAM which is ancient now a days. 

I finally stumbled upon these RAM sticks: https://www.wootware.co.za/g-skill-f3-1866c10d-16gsr-sniper-16gb-2x8gb-ddr3-1866mhz-cl10-1-5v-black-desktop-memory.html

I believe that they are compatible but for some reason they are more expensive than DDR4 RAM. 

I don't really have the money to upgrade my motherboard and all that at the moment, but I believe it will be necessary at some point to upgrade my pc parts. 

Should I just buy the RAM or should I rather update my entire motherboard and RAM because it will be more beneficial in the long run?

I cannot pinpoint the issue though because the system log just shows a kernel error and all info is always lost because of the sudden shutdown(no bsd's no nothing).

I took the CPU fan off the CPU to see if there was something wrong but all looked good, no bent pins, no damage. Reapplied thermal paste and put it back on.

No temp issues (between 36 - 46 in idle, around 60 under load)

Changed all my powercables in my room. Bought a new powersupply, changed all the powercables in my system.

Updated to the latest mobo bios and windows drivers.

Troubleshooted my GPU.

Cleaned everything.

Nothing resolved the problem. It just happens extremely random, though if i try to reinstall WIndows , it ALWAYS shutsdown mid install (this caused windows to start acting weird, sigh not smart, i know, however i thought it could be a software issue -_- ... Everything still works though some programs wont start anymore so i really need to reinstall but am unable to).

At the beginning of the day i would normally be able to use my desktop for quite a while, however, once the shutdowns begin, it happens faster.

Normally i can fix these things myself but i'm absolutely clueless this time.

I'm thinking it's perhaps the CPU or MOBO but could be something else too.

fr8hgd,shroudedwolf51,"Windows 10 machine intermittently reporting ""No option to boot to.""","This is going to be long to try to give as much information as I can.

About half a year ago, I refurbished HP EliteDesk 800 G1 for my mother to replace her Core2 Quad Q6600 based Win7 desktop. I cleaned it out, repasted it, upgraded the RAM, stress tested it (IntelBurnTest with 25 passes followed by AIDA64 overnight) while keeping an eye on temps (I forget what it was, but it was all reasonable), bought brand new storage for it (SSD boot, HDD storage) as well as new SATA cables, set up Win10 on it, and off it went. 

About two weeks ago, she phoned me up saying that the machine ""had locked up"", she pulled the power, restarted it, and the machine was reporting that ""IDE device failed"". Oh, dear. I asked her to remove any devices other than the keyboard and mouse and reboot it and the message had changed to ""No option to boot to."". I came over and sure enough, that's what it was displaying. I powered down the machine, intending to check the BIOS, powered it back up, got a little ...and, it booted into Windows 10 like nothing happened. I checked the storage to make sure it didn't have issues with CrystalDiskInfo, everything was blue across the board. Ran chkdsk /f /r, no issues found. Did a CrystalDiskMark benchmark with nine passes, nothing looked out of the ordinary. I ran a small script I wrote that simply runs sfc /scannow, DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth, /ScanHealth, and RestoreHealth on it and no issues were located. I had to get up early for work, so I told her to let me know if it happens again and left.

Fast forward to today. I woke up to a series of photos from her. ""IDE device failed"", just like last time. A recovery screen saying ""Your PC/device needs to be repaired"" and an error code of 0xc0000185. And, ""No option to boot to."" just like last time. This time, I was paying attention and in the BIOS, the only thing that seemed out of place was that in the boot order, Windows Boot Manager was missing, only displaying the MX500 SSD and USB Device (I've manually disabled all of Legacy boot, network boot, and boot from optical device). Odd. Rebooted the device and it boots into Windows 10 like nothing had ever happened. Checked CrystalDiskInfo, both drives are reporting Good with no parameters looking out of the ordinary. Ran the script again, again no issues. Rebooted it a few times just for good measure, no issues. Any odd applications or processes I don't recognize? None. 

Started looking around for assistance. I saw some reports of HP EliteDesks having issues with SATA ports, so I switched the boot drive from SATA 0 to SATA 1, data drive from SATA 1 to SATA 2, and optical drive from SATA 2 to SATA 0. I also switched to a different SATA cable for good measure. Re-ran CrystalDiskMark benchmark and no noticeable changes compared to the last time. 

Then, I attempted to look for solutions using the error code. The most likely consensus seemed to be that it was mild corruption in MBR. Fair enough. Downloaded a brand new .iso of the OS using the Microsoft tool and using a newly downloaded copy of Rufus, put it on a USB stick. Booted into that. Got into cmd.exe. Started following instructions for BOOTREC. BOOTREC /FIXMBR, check. BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, access denied. Huh. BOOTREC /SCANOS, Total identified Windows installations: 0. BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, same result. 

Okay. Gotta rebuild the thing. I tried to run bcdedit /export c:\bcdbackup, it completed successfully. Followed that by attrib c:\boot\bcd -h -r -s and it can't find the path C:\boot. 

The only other advice that I've found to do (other than to clean install, since I can't really just nuke it from orbit) is to do an in-place upgrade from Win10 to Win10 while keeping applications and files. That is in progress right now. 

My questions are as follows. After the process finishes, is there anything else I should try to attempt to figure out was happening? Are there any other diagnostics bits that I can attempt to run to prevent this from happening in the future? And, any ideas on what may have been the issue? At this point, it's as much about remedying the issue as it is to sate my own curiosity to try to figure out what happened and why it wouldn't replicate on the spot. 

Thank you in advance for your time.

fr8gav,willmaster123,Computer keeps crashing and makes a loud BRRRZZZZ noise before crashing. Dump file not created. No BSOD. Doesn't happen consistently.,"This has been an issue which has actually been going on for a really long time now. But there are long periods of time where it doesn't happen, and then some times where it happens within 2-3 minutes of playing a game, over and over. 

I am pretty sure it has something to do with my graphics card. I did a furmark test to test my GPU, temps remained okay (CPU temps in general are also good), but it crashed even on just a medium setting after one minute. But as I said, its not consistent. I tried it again on an even higher setting on furmark and it went a whole 7 minutes before I got bored and exited out. Yesterday when I was playing a game it crashed in around 2 minutes, then again crashed in the same time. Later that day I went on and played for over an hour with no problems. 

Checked event viewer, it doesn't create a dump file. It says ""Dump file creation failed due to error during dump creation."" and ""Audit events have been dropped by the transport.  0""

Also, it often buzzes really loud from the speakers before crashing, but not always. Also, there is often a significant series of audio and lag problems directly before the crash, like 5~ seconds of the fps dropping suddenly and audio glitching in and out. The computer always restarts after the crash. I thought it might be an audio driver issue, but then why would it crash during the furmark test that first time? No audio there. 

I'm really confused, any annoyed honestly. I know this sounds corny but I never feel 'safe' or comfortable playing games because I know it could just crash suddenly at any moment, and its totally unpredictable as to when. It only crashes during gaming, not otherwise. Also ive already lowered the power settings, no change.

fr8dg0,KCLDNJMA,4 Year-Old Vizio Smart TV Display Help,"Hopefully this is an appropriate place to put this. Last night the right half of the screen of my 55"" D55u-D1 Vizio 4K smart tv turned to white static, while the left half remained the same. I was watching a show on Amazon, so I know it wasn't a poor connection with another device. After that it shut itself off after about five minutes, which it has never done.

I've since tried the following;
Doing a hard factory reset
Removing the back and disconnecting and reconnecting the ribbon cables (Two on the bottom, one on the top, I've tried all three and I think it's connected to the TCon board if I remember right. I'm somewhat technologically illiterate, sorry)
Disconnecting those cables and swabbing them with isopropyl alcohol

After swabbing it with alcohol and turning it back on, the static on the right side of the screen is gone, but now the right side of the screen is brighter than the left, and displays different colors in the following order; black, white, black, red green, blue, black, white, red, green, blue, black, white, etc.
It also can't be turned off by the remote, and still turns itself off after about five minutes.

What's weird is before I swabbed it, I would turn it on and see the Vizio logo, fully displayed, and then after about three seconds the right half of the screen would turn to static again. So it was like the right half COULD function, it just was displaying static for whatever reason, but now it's just colors with no logo.
I've never hit my TV (though right now I'm tempted to grab my sledgehammer and take it outside), the only thing that's ever happened to it is my young children have made greasy handprints on it and drawn on it with crayon, so I wonder if that's burnt something out. Any advice is much appreciated, I just feel sick about spending money on a new device when the old one is less than five years old and has been mostly treated with care.",0,1585498644,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr8dg0/4_yearold_vizio_smart_tv_display_help/,techsupport,1

fr7n2u,Pretty-Reward,Suddenly unable to see 5Ghz networks,"Obligatory reminder to everyone to stay inside and wash your hands :)

**Specs:**

\-Intel Core i7 9700

\-rtx 2080ti

\-16 gigs of corsair ram

\-Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo

\-Asus prime z390A mb, Corsair RM850 850

\-And perhaps most importantly: ASUS PCE-AC88 AC3100 WiFi card.

**Problem:**

My building offers routers that have both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz connections, and until recently I had no issues connecting to the 5Ghz network with my PC.  However the other day I suddenly was unable to see the 5Ghz connection, let alone connect to it, leaving me stranded on the 2.4Ghz connection.  I am still able to connect to 5Ghz with no issues on my phone and laptop, so I assume it is not an issue with the router.  Usually the 2.4Ghz connection is fine, however even on my phone and laptop my speeds on it are really slow.  (On my PC I am currently getting a clean 80-100KB/s :) )

*In short* I would appreciate if someone could help me fix suddenly being unable to see my 5Ghz network on my PC.

**Troubleshooting steps (In order):**

\-Reinstalled WiFi adapter drivers  [https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/PCE-AC88/HelpDesk\_Download/](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/PCE-AC88/HelpDesk_Download/) 

\-Tried following guides online such as  [https://thegeekpage.com/5ghz-wifi-not-showing-up-in-windows-10-solved/](https://thegeekpage.com/5ghz-wifi-not-showing-up-in-windows-10-solved/)  

\-Clean reinstall of windows keeping personal files

\-Clean reinstall of windows removing everything

\-Tried installing older driver

(I do not have physical access to my router so I have not tried restarting it or anything)

I believe that the issue lies with my PC as I am able to see and connect to the 5Ghz network just fine on my phone and laptop.  I reinstalled the latest drivers for my WiFi card to no avail.  I googled around for answers, but most of what I could find were guides showing how to find out if your WiFi card can even connect to 5Ghz (which mine can).  

I tried following the geek page guide linked above (which mirrors steps found on other sites as well), but in the advanced settings of my adapter I do not see ""802.11n Mode"" (though I do see an ""802.11d Support (Auto-Country)"" option), or ""Preferred Band.""  As this is a clean install of windows with no history of drivers, I cannot choose the ""Roll Back Driver"" option.  I also tried installing one of the older drivers on the Asus site, but after running the install wizard for it, windows says I have the latest drivers installed, which makes me think I did something incorrectly?  

I have also done two fresh installs of windows, the first keeping my personal files and and second wiping everything entirely, but the problem has not been fixed.  

I understand that with everything going on with COVID-19 WiFi speeds are going to be slower in general (which is why I assume my 2.4Ghz speeds are so slow), but as I can connect to 5Ghz without issue from other devices I feel there is something else going on.  Worse case scenario I just have to buy another WiFi adapter on the chance that somehow mine just broke seeing as I cannot think of any other options.

I will also mention that my WiFi card was bought in Japan while I currently live in the UK.  This should not be an issue however as, again, I was having no issues until just the other day.

Thanks in advance for the help and I will be active in checking replies.

**Tldr**: Suddenly I am no longer able to see my 5Ghz connection on my PC despite having no issues with my phone or laptop, and while stuck on 2.4Ghz connection on PC my speeds are laughably slow.

**P.S**. I do not know if it is important, but my PC lists my driver version as ""1.558.48.8,"" whereas on Asus' site it lists the latest as ""2.8.0.7"" (I'm not sure if the discrepancy is just some file syntax thing or not).

**P.P.S.** The only change I made to my PC recently was the installation of my new GPU, however my WiFi issues only started a few days after that.

Is there any way to open or click on all the files in the network tab instead of individually opening them all up

fr7mss,iHateReddit08,ASUS Laptop Boot to Black,"I bought a refurbished Asus Zenbook Pro in 2017. Since purchase, it has always had this issue where the laptop is on but it boots to a black screen. Whenever I have to get the screen to come up, I have to press the ""Fn"" and ""F7"" key every single time. Eventually, especially if the laptop went to sleep or was previously turned off incorrectly, it won't come back up. In that case, I have to attach to an external monitor or even reinstall windows. But the problem never permanently fixes. Additionally, I noticed the laptop always disconnects to the internet upon boot up, too.

I don't believe its a hardware issue but an issue with the firmware. However, I've tried downloading bios and firmware from the ASUS website and the downloads never work or are incompatible. ASUS refuses to work on it without a fee even before it was out of warranty. 

The model number on the back of my laptop is UX501V and N501VW in my System info. It runs Windows 10 64-bit and my drivers are up to date. I already updated the graphics driver and the NVIDIA Geforce driver. I also tried disabling the touch feature but it still boots to black.

fr7ld8,MrDerpinati,WiFi Dowloading and Uploading Problems,"Hi all,

My wifi sometimes just stops downloading/uploading things for no reason

By downloading, i do not mean actually downloading, i mean downloading as in watching videos, opening the browser etc. If you use android, you'll see that there is a wifi symbol and near there should be an arrow that points up, and one that points down

For some reason my wifi shows a greyed out down arrow symbol, sometimes the up arrow, indicating it has stopped downloading/uploading respectively.

I have a huawei p20 lite and it is nearly 2 years old

and i have a Hub 3 Virgin Media wifi router

I need both the up and down arrows to be black, or in other words functioning so i can watch videos, however as soon as one of the arrows disappears i have to restart my phone for it to work slightly again.

is my phone the problem or is it my router?

fr7fym,CleansingRitual,Question about notepad++ double click behavior between certain characters,"Hello there, greetings. I have a question about the double click behavior on a program called notepad++. Specifically, I have noticed that certain symbols will stop the double click selection.

For example, take this string of text.

wordsandtext-notepad-morestuff

If I were to double click the word 'notepad' in the following string of text, the selection of text would stop at both of the dash '-' characters. Both before and after the word 'notepad'.

My question therefore, is there anyway to modify which characters notepad++ respects as stopping points for a double click selection? If at all possible, I would like to remove all such respect for any characters, so that I can select an entire line of text with a double click.

I exhaustively looked through all of the available options within notepad++, but could not find anything that looked relevant. I am hoping someone more knowledgeable and experienced, either with notepad++ or computing in general, can be of assistance.

I've been trying to remove ""Realtek (R) Audio"" drivers off my system for quite some time now. I am doing this, because these drivers are horrendous: you can't listen to music with volume all the way up/ if there's bass, because audio gets all distorted; the audio in general sounds terrible and etc. I used to have Realtek High Definition Audio drivers, which worked perfectly, until about 3 months ago they've got replaced with Realtek (R) Audio and I had no luck returning to my previous drivers again.

Things I've tried doing:
- Uninstalling, reinstalling, rolling back, disabling the drivers through device manager.
- Installing the audio drivers from my motherboard's manufacturer's website and Realtek's official website.
- Disabling automatic driver downloads through ""Devices and Printers"" section.
- Used ""Display Driver Uninstaller"" to hopefully get rid off the drivers.
- Contacting Microsoft support.

All of these came to no luck, after rebooting the system, I could see Realtek High Definition Audio drivers installed and after a couple of seconds, they get replaced by the Realtek (R) Audio drivers.

The drivers only seemed to get reinstalled to Realtek (R) Audio if there's internet connection.

Is there something I'm missing or is reinstalling Windows the only option left?

Sometimes it's bad enough that I have to turn off wifi all together and just use my mobile data to move about sites.

I say it might be a DDOS because the community I’m in is no stranger to inflicting such acts against opponents. However, I need to do school work and cannot when I cannot access the internet.

I was surprised to find that neither of the two upstairs coax inputs worked - I couldn't get connected to the internet even plugging in with ethernet. Is this common, for only one input to be wired to work for internet? I assume the upstairs ones would work for cable TV but I don't have cable TV so I can't test that.

There are also ethernet ports in each of the rooms, but I'm assuming that doesn't help with my problem since the modem has to be connected to coax in at least one location?

So I have this camera, Sony PXW-FS5, which has an ethernet port and is apparently able to directly stream video via an ethernet cable to my computer (iMac). The idea is, to take the live signal from the camera and stream it to Youtube via OBS with the iMac as a hub. Now, I have pretty much experimented all of Saturday and half of Sunday with this. And although the camera itself says it is streaming, I don’t know how to access the stream on my Mac and am even doubtful if there is any signal coming through at all. I am pretty sure that I fucked up some the Network setting, because I have no idea how any of this works. 

 How do I go about this? How do I access the video signal that is coming in via LAN on my computer? What IP-Adresses do I need to give to the camera and to the Network? How do I use Ports? What is a Subnetmask, what do I need and use it for?

I have had this issue for a few months now: Whenever i set-up a custom profile in wattman through the Radeon software, the profile keeps resetting itself without user input during gameplay/ other random tasks. Whenever the profile gets reset, MSI Afterburner also closes itself.

I have installed MSI afterburner and RTSS, but this issue appeared before those were installed as well.

Upon searching the web for possible fixes i stumbled some older threads which tell me to change my windows power settings and disable fast boot. I did disable fastboot, in windows as well as in my bios settings, but this does not seem to have any effect on the constant crashing.

If anyone of you has an idea of how to fix this, i would greatly appreciate your comment, thanks!

fr6cv6,Zero_Storm,Should I use VM Virtual Box and imaging or physical drive connection?,"I know the title is worded weirdly, but it's the shortest way to put it. Basically, my parents still have the desktop that we used for years as a family when I was younger, before I went to college and got my own computers. This thing is ancient. I remember it had a staggering 512mb of RAM and ran Windows XP. It's still sitting in their house, collecting dust and god knows what else as it hasn't been turned on in close to a decade at this point.

So naturally, with little else to do in my free time now, I wanted to get into the drive, see if there's anything useful I might pull off of it, and then basically slag that nightmare of my childhood. The problem I have, however, is that while I was always smart enough to not try to actively infect my computer with every virus and malware known to man, my parents and younger sibling were not... quite as careful or computer literate. 

I've thought about imaging the drive and running it in a VM program, though while I'm sure the HDD is (otherwise) fine, I have no idea if the computer would even power on after so long in dormancy. I have no issues pulling the drive out and just shoving it into my desktop that I have now, but even if I isolate the drive by unplugging my three other drives, I'm not sure if it could somehow damage my motherboard. I'm guessing that anything that would have affected the old computer would just get found and killed by even Windows Defender on an up-to-date Win 10 machine, but I don't know enough about viruses/malware to be sure, so that's why I'm here.

TL;DR: Should I try to image the old drive and run it in a VM software, or should I just hook the drive up to my PC and just pull anything I want off with a USB drive to migrate?",2,1585490711,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr6cv6/should_i_use_vm_virtual_box_and_imaging_or/,techsupport,1

fr6asg,overthinkingpigeon3,How do I find out which software is causing my PC to crash? (if that's the cause),"Bit of a difficult explanation since I'm not an expert with computer stuff, but my 6 month old gaming PC regularly crashes (blue screen), usually while I'm on chrome although sometimes not. The blue screen tends to give me a different reason each time.

Whenever I look up the possible causes it always points me to the same explanation: there's a piece of software that's not compatible and that's why it keeps crashing. I've heard that it could be something to do with NVIDIA drivers but I update them regularly and it still happens.

When I bought the PC it already had a load of files on it from the shop who built it, which I'm assuming are just the stuff that keep it running. The only real stuff that they had installed on it was Chrome, a demo for a game (I think half life 3?) and a system monitor thing that tells me how hot the PC is and how much CPU usage there is.

So that begs the question: how the hell do I figure out which piece of software is causing this if that's the case?",0,1585490463,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr6asg/how_do_i_find_out_which_software_is_causing_my_pc/,techsupport,1

# Graphics card not being recognised after reset

I downloaded a fresh installation of windows 10 from the microsoft windows 10 media installation tool as my current version would kept coming up with the ""No changes were made error"" when I tried to reset it otherwise. After it was finished I found my graphics card (details listed at the end) was no longer being recognised.  
It no longer appears in device manager in the adaptors section or in any other, and it has been set to view hidden devices.  
It no longer appears in any autodriver update programs (never used it before today but thought it may be worth a shot).  
It also does not appear in geforce experience, as well as any drivers I try to install failing to install due to not having the correct gpu.  
Currently my pc is using the basic ""Microsoft Basic Display Adaptor"" which is pretty much useless for my kind of work.  
I tried looking through the bios, which seems the graphics card isn't even showing up there, though I may have made a mistake.

Any idea what I should do?

A few years ago I bought an Acer Predator G3-605 to play GTA5 with mods, but as I can remember, it's been crashing ever since I first started using it, I have no real knowledge on PC's so this is very frustrating to me, especially as I can't find a fix online.

The crashes started as the screen freezing and little pixels going discoloured and sometimes accompanied by loud 'buzzing'. 
I have also gotten the BSoD and sometimes the screen just gets really messed up, I will put in a link to an IMGUR album to show what it looks like.

My question is whether or not this software monitors employee's PC activity when it's installed on our home PC? I always exit the program from running in the task bar when she's done with it hoping that will prevent it if it does monitor. Although if it also reads your HD data and sends that information, exiting it between uses isn't going to help much I suppose. I know nothing about work from home software.

fr5wnz,Goderitch,2560 x 1440 resolution via HDMI with NVidia GeForce GT 730?,"Hello,

I recently bought two Philips 245E1S/00 - Quad HD (2560 x 1440@75Hz). However, currently I'm running them at 1080p@60Hz because that's the highest resolution I can select with my NVidia GeForce GT 730 :(

Before buying them I read and I read if my GPU would be able to support that resolution since it's quite old already. According to the manufacturer of [GV-N730-2GI](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N730-2GI-rev-10/sp#sp) which is Gigabyte the **Digital max resolution is supposed to be 2560 x 1600** therefore through HDMI and DVI-D output the GPU should be able to pull out 1440p. Unfortunately, it does not.. And here my journey begins:

1. I attempted to update my driver to the latest Nvidia version 445.75 but it turns out Nvidia halts support for Fermi based graphics cards and the latest version available for GT 730 is 391.35.
2. The monitors are connected the following way: The first monitor is connected directly with HDMI 1.4 cable to the HDMI port. The second monitor is connected via HDMI 1.4 cable which has a DVI adapter and it's then connected to the GPU's DVI port. The HDMI cables that I'm using are the ones that came with the monitors.  
I tried running only one of the monitors connected directly to the HDMI port - still only 1080p.
3. Interesting part is that I'm able to run 1440p on both monitors with my laptop that has Intel HD Graphics 520.

Is there something I'm missing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",0,1585488605,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr5wnz/2560_x_1440_resolution_via_hdmi_with_nvidia/,techsupport,1

I'm trying to set up a webcam style thing for Zoom, but as there's a massive shortage on webcams right now, I've got a setup using my phone. Its a Samsung S10.

However, I can't get the microphone to work. Its a cheap one with a TRRS jack, so designed to  work in phones. It will work if I record video or audio on my phone, but not if I use DroidCam. I suspect that DroidCam isn't supplying power to the microphone, causing this problem.

fr5eqj,IKnowYourWifi,PC crashing under load after cleaning,"
For the past few months my GPU (Vega 64 Liquid Cooled) has air in the AIO closed loop and I’d hear the noise of air running through the pump. My temps would reach a max of 71 C during gaming and I’d have no other issues, so I didn’t act on it immediately.

I was playing games this morning without any issues, but I wanted to clean out dust in my computer, which involved me taking the GPU off the MOBO and then replacing it. Things haven’t been the same since :(

Two issues have been happening since. 
1) My GPU crashes under load, and I’ll get a black screen and the fans stay on like the cpu fans, gpu radiator fan, and RAM lights up. But the PC just shuts off entirely most of the time now. 
2) there’s a humming sound that wasn’t that before that’s coming from the GPU or PCIE slot. It’s pretty consistent but stops here and there. Not sure if this is the pump or not, but my temps still aren’t high because I can’t even begin gaming once it crashes in the menu. 

I wish I didn’t touch my gpu at all, things were near perfect before. I quadruple checked the PCIE connection and seems like it’s seated properly. When I removed my GPU I could hear the liquid and air “sloshing” around but I haven’t heard the air bubbles pass through my pump since I put it back on the MOBO

Specs:
Ryzen 2600x
PSU Gold 1000W (I initially had 500W which wasn’t enough for the VEGA 64)

I built this pc back in January and everything was going great until a couple of days ago. 

I started getting random restarts, no warning or anything just suddenly all goes black for a second and the pc reboots. This happens seemingly randomly. Sometimes I could just game and work for a day without any problems but other times it just kept doing it after five, ten or twenty minutes.

I’ve been looking online for solutions and have tried about everything. I changed everything using parts from my gf’s pc. Changed the ram sticks, same thing happens, different psu, gpu, ... nothing helps. So other than the cpu and mobo I’ve changed everything.  The cpu isn’t overheating btw, I watches Hwmonitor untill the restart happened and all temps were fine.

I thought maybe it was software related, flashes the mobo with the latest firmware, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers,.... 

After all of this I wanted to try and reinstall Windows 10. I formatted the drives, made a boot usb with windows on it (straight from the microsoft website). Now I get these black screens when I try to install Windows... aaargggh  so frustrating. I changed drives to other ones but same thing happens. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t have another motherboard or cpu to test the ones I have. What do you guys think? 

I made this speccy before I tried to reinstall windows, maybe this helps someone?

fr4gj3,schudermcgavin,Weird Internet Issue,"I'm not sure if this is the right sub to be doing this, but I could sure use some answers for this issue I have. I wouldn't consider myself a tech wiz, but I know my way around a computer fairly well. I've dealt with a lot of weird problems before, but this is completely unique for me. 

About a week ago, I started getting a strange drop in internet for my Comcast. Strangely it happens for every app I have open besides Discord. Whether it be Chrome, Battlenet, or Steam, about every 30 seconds-1 minute everything will disconnect for a half second, and then reestablish the connection. Yes, it still happens if Discord is closed. It would appear no game I use can bear the thought of losing internet for even a moment, and they are essentially unplayable. The only thing that works is streaming videos, because it buffers enough to the point where it doesn't catch this dip in connection. 

I've done speed tests(this is pretty decent internet at around 800mbps download speed, 40up), I've done a ping test for it, I've reset the modem remotely, replugged it several times, done a factory reset on the modem, changed the password and kicked every other device off the Wi-Fi so my desktop was alone with the internet, while trying a direct connect as well as solely using the Wi-Fi connection. Nothing seems to work or even detect an issue. All my scans have come up empty as well as a clean up in safe mode and I just did a reformat a month ago that was working perfectly fine till this began.

I've called tech support and chatted with someone on their messaging service and they noticed no errors on their end, nor any drop in connection. They reset the modem and Gateway, same as I. They can't send out a technician out unless my internet is completely broken due to coronavirus. I'm basically unable to do anything besides stream TV and one can only netflix so much in quarantine before losing it. 

I'm curious if anyone can explain how this issue can be resolved, or if they know this is due to the quarantine putting a strain on connections(although I've had over 20 friends in my area tell me they had no issue). I've been looking up different fixes for days and nobody seems to have an answer. I hope you can help me out, reddit. It's nearly 4 a.m. and I'm done trying for today, but I'll be sure to answer any clarifying questions some of you may have tomorrow when I wake up.

fr4dbp,loerresking,Decisions to make concerning my PC,"Hey Guys,
This is my first posting on this board.
I recently had a lot more time to play some games on my PC, which is kind of oldish I guess.
It consists of a Xeon 5650, 24GB of DDR Memory and a Gtx1080, SSD and HDD Raid as well.
I have a Supermicro Dual 1366 Mainboard spare, as well as two more X5650. And 48GB of ECC Memory.
When playing games that have recently been released, my CPU frame times are spiking so much, playing doesn't feel smooth despite the good overall framerate.
Would it be worth to switch to the dual Xeon System to enjoy gaming more?
I am playing on a 144hz Monitor, so this Frametime Spikes are really annoying..
Or should I just toss those systems and upgrade?

I really don't know what to do, the market is just so chaotic, despite me working a full time job in It, I can barely grasp what is the best decision to make.

fr4d8k,itsRainee,Same fps across all settings &amp; crashes on high settings," Hi!  


**The issue;**  
I recently (1,5 months ago) built a new pc. I'll list the specs below.  
Currently facing a very annoying issue. After the first month of using my pc, I noticed frames started dropping. Quite alot even. For example; in Black Desert Online, I went from 180 to 110 fps, same settings, same scene, etc.  
What makes it even more odd is that on every graphic settings (in many different games aswell), I get the same FPS. Also, when I play games on high settings, I seem to crash alot. This also started occuring at the same time as the FPS issue

 **Everything i tried so far;**  


* Clean install GPU Drivers (using DDU)
* Update every driver (bios, chipset, etc.)
* Use friend's components (RAM, PSU)
* RMA old GPU and get new one
* Fresh install Windows
* Undid overclock on RAM
* Checked issue on both SSD's
* Monitor temps, everything is fine
* Benchmarks (3Dmark time spy &amp; Cinebench R20). Scores were around the same as comparable systems.
* Check component usage (usage on high settings: CPU around 30-40, GPU around 70).

The only components I haven't swapped out are the motherboard and CPU. Could it be that the issue lies there?

 **Specs;**  
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600x  
CPU Cooler: Arctic Freezer 34 Esports Duo  
GPU: MSI RTX 2060 Super Gaming X  
RAM: 16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX - 3000MHZ CL15 (Overclocked to 3400MHZ)  
MOBO: MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX  
PSU: Corsair CX550M  
Drives: WD Green m.2 SSD 240GB, Gigabyte 2.5"" SSD 480GB  
Case fans: 2x Be Quiet! Pure Wings 120mm(intake), 2x NZXT Aer RGB 2 120mm (exhaust)

Since most of my classes have moved online, I've had to use Zoom, Skype, and MSTeams. Specifically, when I use my microphone and camera to video chat, after about 15-20 minutes on call the person on the other end will ""lose connection"" and then my laptop will just freeze up. Can't move the mouse, can't CRTL-ALT-DEL. Nothing. So I'm forced to do a hard restart. 

This has happened at least 10-11 times over the past week and a half. I've deleted Skype (as I don't use it as much as Zoom).

fr3l2m,RandomTaco123,Can't figure out how to switch from Legacy to UEFI boot mode?,"Hello everyone.  

I am using a Toshiba Satellite M840-A764, Windows 10 Pro. BIOS is Insyde Software version 1.50.

I'm trying to change my boot mode from Legacy to UEFI but I'm not sure if it is even supported or if I'm doing something wrong.  
  
According to HWiNFO, my motherboard is UEFI capable, but when I enter BIOS setup, there is no option to change to UEFI. There's not even an option to disable Secure Boot or anything like that.

For the record, I converted my disk from MBR to GPT, and upon restarting, there still wasn't any option to change to UEFI boot mode (I got locked out and had to reinstall Windows lol)

fr3iui,Antihero89,Ubuntu 19.10 / Windows 10 - Using 3 monitors does not work correctly,"Hi there,

I transported my office PC back home since I am doing home office because of the current situation. In office I have two monitors. At home I have an monitor for working with my (old) notebook. So I took both monitors with me two have three monitors for the current situation.

I figured out that the graphics card only supports two monitors even though it has three ports (VGA, HDMI &amp; DVI). In a tutorial I read that it is possible two connect two monitors to the deticated graphics card and connect the third one to the internal GPU and the motherboard. For using that method I had to enable using both GPUs in the BIOS.

The right monitor is positioned in vertical, the other ones horizontal orientation. The middle monitor is connected via HDMI to the external card. First I had the right one connected via DVI to the external card as well and the left one via VGA to the motherboard.   
First of all this was unconvenient because GRUB loader and the Ubuntu login screen where on the right monitor and before login the horizontal orientation was not showed correctly so the text was flipped in 90°. Second of all even though I now had an image working on all three monitors, I could not go with the mouse on the one (internal GPU). Moving a large window to the left worked partially but also not correct. Also the image had a border.  
Then I switched so that the left one was DVI external, the middle one HDMI external and the right (horizontal) was HDMI internal. Now I can move the mouse to the right monitor, but when I do so my other two monitors kind of scroll. So that when I move completly to the right, the image on the left monitor is out of the viewing area, the image of the middle monitor is displayed on the left one and the image of the right horizontal one is also mirrored on the middle one. I also tried connecting the right one to VGA internal instead of HDMI internal but I got the same result.

This only happens with Ubuntu. With Windows 10 the right monitor (internal VGA) is not detected at all?

I have a hp laptop with very little memory that was initially meant for my writing. During current isolation I decided to download a game via origin. Due to the laptops memory I bought a 1TB external hardrive. Origin does not save games to a root source so I had to download things bit by bit but move each thing over to the hardrive before downloading the next. It was hard with the download stopping and starting but I managed to move the majority of the laptop to the hardrive then things went smoothly from there.

Now my niece has the same laptop as myself and decided she would like the game too. So I bought her the same hardrive as mine and went through the same process. But for some reason no matter what I delete from the laptop or move from the laptop to the hardrive the game will not download whatsoever. It will say (for example) please clear 3mb of storage to continue download. I'll delete, move and rearrange everything but somehow when I come back to re load it all and try to download again it asks for even more memory for example please clear 6mb of storage to continue. Even though there is literally nothing left of the computer. The number becomes greater each time rather than smaller. I'm scared to do anything else to the computer, I've moved deleted and disabled that many things I'm afraid I'm going to break her laptop. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to clear any more memory? I just dont understand how it's the same laptop, same hardrive, same game yet this time the memory request is greater with each move/deletion.

This kind of confused me, I was only calibrating devices in settings, surely this should be light work for this PC? All of a sudden my display goes black. Reconnected cables, nothing. The PC was still running, the fans still screaming. I shut down the PC and restarted it. The same thing happened seconds after booting up. Figured I’d shut it down again and give it time to cool. Several minutes go by and I try again. Everything seemed nominal. I checked the temps in the control module, both CPU (Intel Core i7-9700F) and GPU (NVIDEA RTX 2060) were at roughly 140°F. I’m not a computer expert, but am I wrong to think those temps are OK? Anyway, I boot up X-Plane once more and pull up the control module to monitor temps. Nothing was loaded, just sitting in the menu screen of X-Plane. All of a sudden the fans start spooling up again. I watched the GPU temperature skyrocket into the high 100s, then 200s, then the screen quits again. I am puzzled. Am I doing something wrong? Was I sold a dud of a PC? I am baffled that a $300 graphics card can’t handle the boot up of a flight simulator. I was skeptical of buying refurbished, I usually never do, but I needed to save a couple bucks. I’ve stopped messing with it before I cause any more damage.

Hoping I can have this issue fixed as I'm really needing the games for quarantine!   


I reformatted my gaming laptop because I was experiencing low FPS in LoL out of seemingly nowhere, and the changes I made to try and fix it were not helping. I'm not super experienced, so there is the possibility that I messed up somewhere in the process.

My disk is at 100% usage, and i'm experiencing significant delays when trying to do anything. I've got two hard drives, one is an SSD and one is a regular HDD. I installed windows to the normal HDD.  I've installed all of the drivers, which is quite the process with a 100% disk issue. I also ran a check disk that took hours, with no improvement. 

I tried some online troubleshooting as well, to no avail. Windows is telling me the drivers are up to date and that the disk is healthy. 

Please let me know what info I can provide to help you guys troubleshoot my issue. Headed to bed after a long night of trying to solve the problems. 

Thank you in advance. Hope there's a solution!",4,1585469240,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr2g0p/disk_usage_at_100_after_reformat_and_chkdsk/,techsupport,1

fr2b4c,RastajeleN,Suddenly choppy/stuttery (packet loss) gameplay without FPS drops - only in Rocket league,"Hi everyone,

**please, I am asking you for big help. I am a bit desperate now**. Any help would be freaking fantastic.

Since about 2,5 months ago my Rocket League started stuttering (major packet loss) at HEATED/INTENSE moments (so more often in 3v3 than in 1v1 matches), feeling like the game dropped FPS from 200 (my usual) to 20 for just a milisecond. But as some of you know, in RL 1 millisecond is everything.

This is now applicable to all game modes and any RL game is just hard to play for me. All other games on my PC are ok.

This is now a MAJOR issue which is making me unable to play Rocket League. For the past 12 days I have been discussing this issue with some nvidia support guy over here: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/348859/suddenly-choppystuttery-gameplay-without-fps-drops/. **Please, if you are serious about helping me, read through that thread. So that you do not suggest something I have already done.** But, nevertheless, the key takeaways:

* this started happening 2 months ago. Way before any lockdowns were triggered. Sudden increase in online traffic is NOT the cause.
* this happens only to Rocket league on my PC at home. I also play ranked in LoL and AoE2 DE and they are OK - they have much longer match times, so I would know
* the cause is not IN MY PC per se. I have tested Rocket league in my friend's place on my PC and monitor, different wired ISP, and it was smooth. It certainly is not a hardware or software issue on my side
* i have played RL with several players and described my issue to them over the past month. Nobody experienced anything similar. 
* please, feel free to check this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h_zr4HzBfv-OnphzBv3Ybm9O32ceKGmu?usp=sharing. Which contains all my important screenshots. As of now, only the hop tracing screenshots are important as they show one traced connection to a RL server (I found the hostname after checking in cmd prompt for -nestat -b/-f after a RL ranked). The other screenshots are just hardware tests during a FIRESTRIKE test run.
* one of those screenshots is from me (the one which ran for a lot of intervals), while the other (19-20 intervals) is from my ISP who claim everything is OK on their side. **But the issue MUST be somehow on their side**. You can see that they are evidently VERY lazy to bother trying anything.

Thanks for reading this far. Any help would be appreciated.

fr293e,Sam--Hyde,GPU Suddenly Running Hotter?,"My Geforce RTX 2080 has suddenly gone up in temperature since last Sunday while playing Modern Warfare. This now happens in any game I play. I am currently using a 1440p monitor. The only time I remember having to deal with adjusting fan curves was when I first had problems running hot playing Escape from Tarkov, which is a pretty poorly optimized game. My I9-9900k runs at a fine and stable temp, but my GPU however, runs hotter than it has in the past noticeably. Should I try thermal repasting? My idle sits at 32-35 C and 75-80 C full load (granted I had to play around with MSI Afterburner fan curve, but it's still quite loud.) I'd like it to run cooler and not have my fans blasting at 70-80% speed as they get quite obnoxiously loud. My goal is to have a lower GPU temperature and run at a lower fan speed.

I've owned my pre-built computer since December of 2018. I rolled back my drivers to 442.74 from 445.75 and did not seem to be the issue. I also used DDU and clean reinstalled my drivers. I've tried under volting and there were negligible results. I did a full scan for possible viruses and so on and got nothing. The ambient temperature in my room is quite low and my [case](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Cases/Obsidian-Series%C2%AE-500D-Premium-Mid-Tower-Case/p/CC-9011116-WW) has three front intake fans and one back exhaust fan. My computer does not get very dusty and it's on my desk, I have dusted it about two months ago. Lowering game settings to low and high seems to not reduce GPU temps by much, like under volting.

I personally feel this may be the stock thermal paste that has been used. Or perhaps maybe a software issue that I do not know of. If anyone has any idea or recommendations that may help it would be greatly appreciated. Also, I no longer have warranty. I'd be glad to provide further information on my specs if they are needed to try to get a better idea of what may be causing the sudden issue.",2,1585468084,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr293e/gpu_suddenly_running_hotter/,techsupport,1

I've been reviving my old gaming PC during the quarantine and everything was smooth and dandy until tonight when I restarted it and it will not boot. My monitor is just a continuous blank red screen from edge to edge. I don't see any posting or bios information. I get a series of beeps which I have been unable to decipher. It seems like 11 beeps total, followed by 5 more after a break, and then 2 (video attached). All are in different tones and speeds.

beep-beep-beep-beep-(high-pitch-beep)    beep-beep-beep beep-beep (long pause) beep-beep-beep-beep-(high-pitch-beep) (long pause) beep-beep

*Technically* it's 11 beeps in the first set but since they're multi toned and spread out, I don't know what to make of them: [https://www.techrepublic.com/article/step-by-step-deciphering-bios-beep-codes/](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/step-by-step-deciphering-bios-beep-codes/)

fr1i6p,leebom,Windows hibernated during Update... now I believe my drive is corrupted,"Hello All,

Long but interesting story:

I saw that my machine was in a ""hibernated' state and upon ""waking up"" my computer, I saw that it was in a Windows 10 update cycle (""Working on updates 30% completed""). Upon an automatic reboot done by the update, my machine received ""Bootmgr is missing"" and I was unable to boot into my OS. 

This is where I spent hours troubleshooting (booting from win10 CD, usb drive, attempting startup repair, attempting system restore, attempting to go back to previous build) pretty much every possible troubleshooting method I could find online but all failed, many using the link below (this isn't the only website i used, I used many many more)

https://www.ghacks.net/2017/05/02/fixing-bootmgr-is-missing-error-in-windows/

I gave up and eventually decided to format my Intel m.2 NVME ssd where my OS was installed. So I booted into my win10 usb drive, went through the typical process of selecting the Windows default language, version, and when I got to the part to select the drive to install windows on, and I did not see my NVME ssd. I even tried installing my Intel NVME drivers onto a usb drive, successfully ""installed"" the driver...

https://www.auslogics.com/en/articles/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/media-driver-issues.png

...But still no drive found. 

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WyON2-wL2MY/hqdefault.jpg

At this point I felt like I've tried everything. I can see the NVME ssd in my BIOS, messed with pretty much every single BIOS setting regarding NVME ssd's (UEFI settings, CSM settings, etc) but still no luck.

What's interesting are these couple of pictures...

1. Before the windows setup process (upon booting Win10 from USB or DVD) I'm receiving this:
https://i.ibb.co/jy7v1wm/before-WINDOWSsetup.jpg
2. During the process of selecting the driver to install for your drive I'm actually **seeing my files in my C drive**
https://i.ibb.co/H2v3gg0/files-Seen.jpg

3. This got me thinking... I read a couple of more forum posts and eventually made a bootable Ubuntu v15.04 USB drive to troubleshoot further. I'm under Ubuntu's file system and see my NVME ssd: however upon clicking on it i see this error:
https://i.ibb.co/4JX95VR/ubuntu.jpg


So this really leaves me to believe that my drive is indeed recoverable. It seems like my NVME ssd is stuck in an ""hibernation"" state, stated above at the start of my post, which is why I'm receiving these error messages. At the beginning of my post, I mentioned that for some reason my computer was at a ""hibernated"" state upon the windows update cycle which is why I initially received ""bootmgr is missing"". The fact that you can see ALL of my files in the file path to install the drivers (Picture section 2.) definitely means that its recoverable, no?


I feel like I'm very close to finally using my computer again. At this point I don't care to:

1. Format my drive and start fresh.

2. Somehow recover my files that I see and then format/ start fresh.

3. Somehow get my drive out of a ""hibernation"" state so it can finish it's windows 10 install and work like normal


Any help would be much appreciated!

fr1b22,Burned-Pixel,[Windows] Driver issues on laptop (Realtek High Definition Audio),"Hello tech support gurus of Reddit.

I own a Asus GL702VMK running windows 10 (18363).  
For the longest time I've had issues with my built in microphone, and so today I had some free time and tried removing the Realtek driver and the microphone started to behave as it should. Hurray!  
But as we all know the story didn't end there, now I'm not getting any sound from my speakers (also built in).

And so the troubleshooting adventure began, 2 hours later and this is what I've found:

* **The microphone and the speaker both use the same driver.**
* **When using the Realtek driver:**
   * Microphone does not work as expected, it does in fact pick up sound because I can see the meter found in control panel go up while tapping straight onto the mic.
   * Built in speakers are working as expected and so does the aux port.
* **When using the Microsoft generic High Definition Audio:**
   * Microphone works as expected.
   * Speakers do not work and aux port has strange behavior but sound does come out  (skipping songs on Spotify when plugged headphones in)

Did some google searches but nothing worked :(

Maybe there is a way to use the Realtek driver on the Speakers/Headphones and the generic one on the microphone? If there is a way, I haven't been able to do it.

If anyone knows how to fix this it would be awesome. Thanks! :)",13,1585463058,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr1b22/windows_driver_issues_on_laptop_realtek_high/,techsupport,1

fr1a3x,MilkWithSalt,Online Classes in Covid-19,"Hi all,

Since COVID-19 started, I have not been able to take my classes with my tutors. My exams have been postponed by  a decent amount of time, but I need to take those classes as there are portions of my syllabus that I need assistance with.

I have tried to whats app video call with my teacher, but the quality was too low, and if he moved it around it blurred even more. Also his network is not very good. He's actually trying to get fiber wired to his house, but the country's under lock down and it's not easy. 

The issue is that in class, he writes in a notebook as he teaches me, and I use those notes for further revision and stuff. An entire session is in those notes. It's the best way we have for my type of examination. 

So I need to have high enough video quality that I can see those notes, as he writes on them and copy them down myself on paper, and i can make do with decent audio quality. You obviously don't need crystal clear level stuff for audio.

I was considering if he had a **e-table**t that he could hook up to his computer, he could stream the tablet (similar to Khan academy, except they record videos privately and then release, if a reference is wished for) through some platform. Unfortunately it will be a bit difficult to get a e-tablet due to COVID-19.

 (Twitch, comes to mind, but it's not really made for this stuff as far as I know, and it might be to complex to get working.)

I'm worried it might just be that we'll have to rig together a tripod or summat, and therefore keep the phone steady, so the image is at least a bit more clear. Then as he writes, he can pause periodically, and I'll note everything down, because the image should clear up. 

For those wondering why not just let him write notes, take pictures, send them to me, and teach using them as slides, that is also a possibility, but for a lot of reasons, not one I wish to opt for. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the technical side of things, I am running a OS X computer with High Sierra. I am not sure about my teacher. I am willing to provide other info if necessary.

Is there any advice or plan or software you can give me? It's quite urgent.

Now i’ve built a few computers so i know my way around a bit but i’m not like a genius or anything; however, i figured installing more ram was as simple as installing it the first time so that’s what i did. I was previously running 2x8gb sticks of corsair vengeance at 3000mHz in dual channel, and installed the exact same kit into my pc in the remaining two dimm slots and just logged into my pc like normal, and since then i’ve had numerous crashes all ending with BSOD and have done a bit of research with the error messages.

anyways long story short i ran a memory test through the pc control panel and it said there was hardware problems so i went ahead and uninstalled the ram and reinstalled it making sure it was the correct way but still getting crashes, especially when trying to run a game. It normally occurs whenever I try to do anything, but occurs more now that i’ve tried reinstalling. now i’m sure there’s a solution to this as i’ve read testing individual sticks but doing such a thing for day on end seems very excessive and i don’t want to commit to something unless it’s going to guarantee a fix. if anyone has any help it would be very much appreciated, thank you so much.",7,1585462235,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr157m/installed_more_ram_and_pc_keeps_crashing/,techsupport,1

Though I can't set my PC to sleep or hibernate anymore.","For more than 4 months I've had this issue with my desktop pc with win10 getting random audio buzz, stutter, lag while gaming, and I just lived with it until a couple weeks ago when I got hellbent on figuring it out and was directed to LatencyMon which showed me I was getting latency spikes, from numerous different .sys files, usually dxgkrnl.sys was the biggest culprit. I spent hours upon hours googling and looking at forums as many people have had this problem .

I tried soooooo many things, usually with drivers, with no success. Finally tonight, I begrudgingly jumped into the googling again, and decided to look up 'acpi.sys latency' which was one of the many files that were shown as an issue in latencymon. Almost everything I was reading was saying acpi.sys has to do with power management exclusive to laptops, without much info about it pertaining to desktops at all. Then randomly I see one single post saying this:

""Go to power settings. Set it to sleep never, and turn off display never."" 

And son of a bitch if it didn't work. No more latency spikes. No audio issues, no lag in games. Almost every forum I've read on this were discussions about drivers, and people who fixed it eventually by updating, disabling, or rolling back some dirver or another. Remedy's ""Control"" has been a good test subject because it's very demanding game and would lag pretty badly and let me see the issues in LatencyMon immediately. And now it's totally smooth sailing. This all started shortly after I installed Studio One to start working on recording music projects, and I see a lot of people online with this problem who are also working with other DAW's. If anyone has this problem and this helps you, I'm glad, and if anyone else is reading this and has any idea why this happened, and why I can't use the sleep function on my computer anymore basically, I'd definitely like to know. I can live with it but a solution would be nice too, I'm just glad this headache is over (I'm pretty sure).",0,1585462200,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr14ym/i_finally_found_a_fix_for_latency_in_win10/,techsupport,1

fr0rec,deaddr0pfred,Samsung S9+ Not Connecting to Wifi - but all other devices can.,"Hello reddit. So my issue is, basically the above. For about 4 days now I have been unable to connect to my homes wifi on my Samsung S9+ phone. Its about two years old. I have had issues with spotty wifi before on this phone, but for like... minutes. Then it would reconnect and be fine. This was infrequent. 

I am the only person in my family with this phone. Everyone else has an iPhone, except for my sisters boyfriend who has a 1+ (he is living for us during quarantine). They have no issues connecting, and neither does any of our computers (we have macs and PCs). 

It's just my phone. I have tried everything I can think of, and somethings suggested by troubleshooting tutorials online. I was able to sucessfully connect to my moms phone as a hotspot, but not our wifi. I would try going somewhere else to see if I could get their wifi, but that's hard right now. 

Here's what I have tried:

-turned my phone on and off again
-forgot our wifi network then rejoined
-reset network settings
-wiped the cache parition 
-reset our router
-checked for software updates (its up to date) 
-reset app permissions 
-deleted newly installed apps in case one was messing with the connection
-checked the devices ""health"" and for malware


Some other stuff like toggling location services and bluetooth, mostly out of desperation. I do not want to do a factory reset but I will, if that is my only option. 

Does anyone have any advice? Any help would be very appreciated.",0,1585460391,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr0rec/samsung_s9_not_connecting_to_wifi_but_all_other/,techsupport,1

fr0gwb,TImmSkiIIer,Can I connect 5V wires to battery pins on a mobile wifi device?,"Hello. I have a Huawei Mobile Wifi E5577Cs-321, and because currently I can't get ahold of any other form of internet connection, this is what I have to use.

Now, the device itself works fine. One issue: the battery is a little bit swollen.
Now, I'm pretty good in electronics, and I know that that's dangerous and it can swell more/possibly explode. But I can't do anything because of the situation that's going on. Normally I could just go to a repair shop and buy a new battery. 

Now, the battery says: 
Model: HB434666RBC
Rated Capacity: 1500mAh/5.7Wh
Rated Voltage: 3.8V
limited charge voltage: 4.35V

The battery has four pins, the two middle ones are unmarked, the two outer ones are marked + and - respectively.

What I want to know: can I supply 5V from a USB cable powered from a power bank? Sure it would just supply 1A because of no connection to the data pins, but would it work? It would be amazing if it could.

I want to fix this as we are still in lockdown and having no internet/knowing that the device could explode any time just sucks.",7,1585459005,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fr0gwb/can_i_connect_5v_wires_to_battery_pins_on_a/,techsupport,1

New to this subreddit but I'm having an issue that I cannot figure out for the life of me.

Recently, I got a Valve Index for Half-Life: Alyx's release. The game came out, and I was able to play through the entire game on Ultra Settings at 120 hz and it ran beautifully. I was even able to start a second playthrough with no issues whatsoever. Other games, like Pavlov, H3VR, and Boneworks worked perfectly as well. However, last night, after playing H3VR for about 15 minutes, my computer restarted itself. At first I figured it was Windows just being Windows, but then I played Half-Life for another 20 minutes and it happened again. And the next time I played Half-Life, it happened again. And again. And again. I've gone through power settings, ran check disk, updated Windows, updated graphics drivers - I even tried running the game on the lowest possible settings because I thought it might have been my GPU overheating for whatever reason - but it restarted itself then, too. I just need help figuring out what it could be - I've gotten Kernel Power Error 41 in Event Viewer every time this restart has happened, but that doesn't exactly narrow it down. It could be that some of my parts are outdated, hell I know it's probably that, but I don't want to go out spending money on replacement parts just for it to continue happening. What confuses me the most is why it's happening now, after DAYS of everything working perfectly fine.

The laptop's screen flushes fine on the righthand side, but the left does not close all the way anymore. My partner briefly inspected what was wrong, and he said the computer was bulging where the battery was. 24 hours before discovering my laptop was not fully shutting, I noticed the fan on my computer was running at high speed nonstop. Even closing and shutting down my laptop, I thought, would get it to quit running. I thought it did for a while, before waking back up early in the morning to hear it still running. I logged back in and closed all I was running (just two browsers) and shut it off before going to work. I get back home to find that the laptop won't close fully. Since it has been a few days, now, with a bulging laptop battery... how safe is this to use and how long can I continue using my laptop? Because I purchased this laptop in November of 2018, my warranty is expired at this point. If this is not okay to use, what can I do next? It's still up and running as I type this (and seeming to work just fine), but with a bulging battery, is this safe, and for how much longer? Am I in need of a new battery replacement right away (as in this week) or can I keep going for another month? (and with computer repair shops in my area closed due to Covid-19, and this my only working computer, what can I do, or should I just purchase another laptop?)

Basically, I wanted to dual boot Windows. So I cleaned 2 drives, and installed Windows on each with the same media. Seems like installing the 2nd one messes with the first. Something occured which repaired this for about a week. This morning, I hit a problem where a repair process ran, and (I think) overwrote the boot partition on the smaller drive, where Windows was installed first, and swapped the C: and F: drives (to match the designation of the 2nd drive). Thus the typical boot files aren't present, and it doesn't work. Anyone encounter this issue before? I'm trying to fix it in the cmd using diskpart, but I don't have permissions on the other drive, and booting from the boot media again leads to being asked to log on, with 0 options (again, probably associated w/ the swap, no users are being found).

Any insights/tools/tips would be great.

fqz83d,andvruss,"Laptop acting as if FN key always pressed, possible registry editor issue","In trying to swap the control and FN key functions via registry edits, I think something went wrong. Whenever I press the s, b, k, p, or spacebar keys, the onscreen keyboard shows that both alt keys are being pressed and the keyboard stops functioning probably until I press Alt. I am unable to use these keys and my laptop is essentially useless. These keys have added functions when pressing the FN key, so that might be part of the issue. 

However, when I hold SHIFT, this seems to override this and I'm able to use all keys. 

Two possible causes for this issue I see are:

1. Laptop stuck in Japanese input mode without the underlying layout installed. I initially thought this because the installed keyboard changed to Japanese 106/109 and persisted through reinstalls. I managed to get rid of this via further registry edits, but this didnt fix the problem. 

2. Alt and FN functions got switched in registry editor and pressing a key (a,b,p,k, spacebar) triggers the FN function of those keys (although nothing happens except both Alt keys being pressed and nothing able to be typed until Alt is pressed again).

Some other notes:

-laptop is a Lenovo E570 running Windows 10 x64

-reinstalled Windows several times, uninstalled and reinstalled keyboard drivers, updated BIOs. None of this helped.

-issue persists in BIOS and in safe mode

-using a USB keyboard fixes the issue

I built it myself and it went decently smooth for my first time building a PC and I got it to work and it was great. Immediately however I noticed the gains weren't as much as I was expecting. I then also kept getting kicked from CS:GO games for being unable to establish connection to VAC secured servers. After trying every possible solution for it I was left with the one I didn't  want to check, some sort of RAM issue. I ran a test online and it said my RAM was performing way below expected, I believe something like 12gb max or something to that effect (don't have the results, it's on the computer). I went ahead and popped open  the case to make sure they were in the suggested slots and making good connections (they were) swapped them to see if anything would change. Nothing did, so I went to the store and bought new RAM (Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro 2x16 3200hz DDR4) and plugged them in, swapping out the old ones. Started up, BIOS said it read 32gb memory, went to run the test again and it said it was still preforming well below expected (something like 16 or 18) so I started trying other positions with both types  of RAM sticks, even all 4 at once and nothing would break it past 32gb in the BIOS. after one of those attempts the computer wouldn't load to BIOS upon power up, only the Red EZ Debug LED came on for CPU. I checked connections, checked the RAM to make sure it was in place, anything like that. I then made the genius move taking out the CPU and losing a few (like 3) pins in the process. I had to take the thermal paste from it and the fan to replace it, so I need to get more to reattach it. So right now me and and my friend are at a loss for the next step, neither of us are that savvy in terms of PC building so any help or tips would be appreciated.

I have checked the DNS service on my windows machine and it is up and running fine with no power settings affecting it

I have ensured that the network adapter is automatically assigning an IP to itself under its properties

I have enabled and disabled the network adapter and also ran a network reset on the machine

I have also updated the network drivers by using another windows machine to download them.

I have also uninstalled bitdefender which I learned could cause this issue however this hasn’t remedied anything

Also restarted my Hub multiple times, also noting that no ports have been changed. The PC is still plugged into the same port it was when it suddenly stopped working.

Please if you have any more suggestions on what to do they would be much appreciated as I am at wits end after 7 hours or constant machine and modem restarts

fqyx4k,Browengazebolo,Windows 7 blue screen and failure of safe repair,"Hey people. The nice folks at buildapc sent me over here for an issue, and was hoping you guys could help me. 

Recently my PC blue screened, and it can't boot up safely. It gets caught in an endless loop and eventually blue screens again, and unfortunately when I try to safe repair it fails to read my keyboard and mouse, rendering it moot when it asks to safe restart/repair. Is there anyway I can salvage my files, or save the os? 

(I unfortunately don't have a disk drive for my pc thanks to the way my case is set up, not that it matters. I don't have a windows 7 OS start disk anyways due to losing it years ago.)",6,1585452270,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqyx4k/windows_7_blue_screen_and_failure_of_safe_repair/,techsupport,1
fqywxe,ysabelsrevenge,"Help begginer out, I tried to build a computer and my computer is insistent that wifi doesn't exist.","So as the title says, I tried to build a computer. Well not just me, but my dad started it off (he actually has previously done this for a living, pre youtube days, so he's not a complete idiot like myself). I may have gotten out of my depth on this one. Dad's bailed due to Corona and work stress and I'm left with a blue cable running through my house.

So here is the situation. I have all the bits in the box, windows installed, motherboard drivers installed, VGA card drivers installed. But alas ZERO wifi.

When I say ZERO wifi, I mean, if you type it into the search bar, no matches are found. WIFI isn't and option period, I need a little help on that front. If I go to the Network and Internet Settings, there is nothing (and I mean nothing, I searched all the options) that mentions wifi at all. I firmly believe that its not a matter of hitting the wrong button on the keyboard as no keyboard we own has that facility.

There is also a distinct possibility something could be installed wrong as the old man (dad) maybe a little sight challenged and black on black doesn't help.

A couple of begginers questions,

1. does the wifi require a separate chip/card/piece of hardware in order to operate? My dad insists its part of the motherboard (also vaguely remember the salesman saying so aswell)?
2. Which brings me to question 2, could it possibly be a switch not flicked during the actual build stage? I remember in the past a lot of switches to be flipped at the start of a build (bare in mind this was 30 yrs ago) and read something along those lines.
3. lastly could it be our copy of Windows. We have the Microsoft OEM system builder license, dont know thats a possiblity.
4. I have looked every where for a damned driver for the wifi, what the hell do I need to search for to find a driver for it, cause I 100% think I'm doing it wrong.

Heres some specifications if this helps, I tried to read up on the motherboard to find out about the wifi, but I'm so lost in all the acronyms.

It was getting a little slow and I planned on replacing it soon anyway, but there's a pandemic so I had to cancel a trip to see her.

So, today her computer kept showing error messages about ""bad image"" for various .dlls and .exes. They would all say something like ""___ is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error."" Her computer would be stuck and unusable, even after dismissing these messages. I could get the computer to start in safe mode, but it still seemed to get slow and stuck. I tried to use ""last known good configuration"" but it didn't fix anything. I googled what to do, and found that I should try SFC /scannow. When I did that, it got stuck at 16%. I tried to use DISM.exe to scan it and that couldn't even be found. I finally tried to do a chkdsk scan and rebooted her computer.

As chkdsk was working, it listed a few file record segments as unreadable, and it said that some bad file records were processed. It deleted some index entries, blah blah. After that, the error messages disappeared but the computer would still be stuck and not functional. When the mouse hovered over any programs in the task bar, the little thinking wheel would spin.

Is there anything else I can do to make it work at all? Or is it just dying and I need to get a replacement shipped to her? My mom isn't allowed to leave her house because of this pandemic, so a working computer is important.

I was doing further research today and I discovered that portable drives under 2T in capacity are formatted to an MBR NTFS drive and larger than 2T are formatted as GPT NTFS drive. I looked for anything on this subject both within Netgear and out on the net in reference to my model router or any wifi router and on the Western Digital website whitepapers but I haven't been able to find anything.

All I want to do is connect my portable drive to the wireless router and use it as media storage that I can access remotely from anywhere as I sync my Samsung phone to my laptop using Microsoft's ""Your Phone App"" and Link to Windows or using RDP.

This quarantine has put me in an endless cycle of doing mini-projects, and my current focus is finding a way to optimize my streaming setup.

I currently have an internal Elgato HD60 Pro that is doing nothing other than taking up a PCIe slot. So I figured rather than having OBS capture my game footage directly through a software capture, why not have it capture my PC's footage through the HD60 Pro directly? For this to happen I'd need a way to split the video feed coming from my PC to my monitor, splitting it in such a way where one end goes to the HD60 Pro and the other continues to my monitor as before.

My issue is, I haven't been able to find such a cable. 

My ask is, is anyways aware of a solution? Am I going about this the correct way? I'm eager to hear some feedback.

I recently moved to a new residence and subsequently acquired a new internet provider (AT&amp;T). With this new internet provider, we were able to acquire a fiber optic connection for the first time.

1. Upon trying to load a page, anyone in my family from any device, whether a mobile phone or a laptop, will be prompted with a privacy error from their respective browser, specifically ""Your connection is not private.""
2. If the aforementioned error does not present itself, the page will load indefinitely before redirecting the user to the modem's administrative page where the connected devices, settings, etc. are listed. If I am not on a browser (for example streaming), I will simply experience very poor connection speed and nothing will load.
3. While playing multiplayer games on this connection, my ping will randomly spike and I will be kicked from whatever server I am playing on.

After installing some drivers with easy driver and restarting pc just wouldn't go after the spinning circle before windows start. I had to reinstall windows because it wouldn't even let me repair or go to a previous state. After reinstalling windows the pc could finally boot up completely,but now when i play some games and say i try to alt-tab to go to desktop or open task manager it freezes and cpu usage rises a lot but it doesn't show what is causing that because it freezes the whole pc(for 10-15 seconds if i'm lucky or completely)and i have to restart it because if it doesn't completely freeze everything goes super slow,even opening a chrome tab. When i'm on discord and alt-tab o go to task manager i can't hear anyone like it mutes but others can hear me. Sometimes i can't even turn off the pc from the windows bar because it doesn't open and i have to manually turn it off.When it boots up again it takes a while but everything is fine.When i plug in a controller and open a game pc also freezes.

The Laptop has 1 HDMI port 

I connected an HDMI splitter (one input + 2 outputs) to the laptop, and 2 HDMI cables into the two monitors respectively.

However, the two monitors are mirrored to each other, and I would like them to be independent. (I.E. display different things)

I have tried having Windows detect the other monitor, it won't. I suspect since it recognizes One output (the HDMI splitter) it only extends one additional display, not two as I would like.

fqxice,More-always,video/streaming Dynamic contrast type of problem,"hi guys. ive been having a recurring video/streaming issue despite having swapped some parts out. gonna try to list all the details.

&amp;#x200B;

the main problems: 

\-happens during video streaming on netflix, amazon prime etc and video playback on vlc, classic media player, the windows media player. if there is a firelit scene or with alternating lighting and shadows in the same scene/frame, the monitor backlight seems to switch from full bright to completely dim. it is garish and really spoils watching stuff like tv.

\-i mostly play one game, Dota 2, and not too often i have stuff like character models getting stuck on loading, color warping out. im hoping random little glitches arent part of the overlying issue. this is relatively rare compared to the omni present butchering of my TV/Movie experience

\-certain apps like task manager and device manager keep refreshing and are basically unusable as they wont let me scroll down long enough or right click long enough to select anything. its like playing whackamole. gets boring and alarming super fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

the hardware: 

i7 6700 CPU

AMD rx 5700 xt ASRock GPU (new bought 3 days ago), the old amd 570 wasnt the issue i guess

32GB RAM

650w corsair PSU i got in 2017

H170 Pro Gaming MB

CV27Q Aorus monitor (new couple months ago), ive tried a sony 32inch TV, a Benq 4k one same issues

&amp;#x200B;

stuff i have tried: 

almost everything except the PSU and MB has been swapped for newer parts in the last couple of months. 

taken everything apart nut and bolt, cleaned out and carefully put back in

new/better wires

there is no setting for dynamic/adaptive brightness in the AMD software, i have turned it off on all 3 recently tested displays to no avail, and i dont have intel HD graphics so i dont know how to do it from windows without messing with stuff i'd rather be more informed about hence im here. 

all the drivers are up to date, windows is up to date, and the driver updating softwares i bought to be sure are also up to date. bios is running the most recent version.

i have tried memtest and followed some online guide instructions on trying to exclude RAM and CPU issues.

At first it would send it but not as I had cut it.  (I wanted to send from 1:59:56 to 3:00:03 but everytime i pressed send it would become a gif of only 3:00:01-3:00:03) Then I tried screenrecording while watching the video thinking that maybe the data of the video got fucked up because of the change but now Whattsapp says that I can not send that GIF and to choose another one.

fqx97t,TheOneWhoKnocks68,Pc shutting down in sleep mode.,"My computer just started this neat trick where it loses all power when it goes into sleep mode. Most of the time it starts back up after I push the power button, but a lot of the time it tries to start up but then loses power immediately afterwards. Following this you can push the power button and it’s a coin flip as to if it works or not. I’ve went in and made sure there was nothing wrong in the power settings and everything. I’m not sure what to do as everything online says to check the settings which I’ve already done. 

The starting up to immediately losing power kind of resembles when you’re trying to start a car and it won’t turn over.

I'm fixing someones laptop that constantly crashes out of boot. Previously they had a different bsod and tried fixing by resetting windows? I am not totally sure about that. But afterwards now it just constantly crashes. Things I have tried in the command prompt in Windows PE(since I can't get into windows anymore):

1) sfc /scannow

RESPONSE: Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.

2) Dism /Image:C:\Windows /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:F:\sources\install.esd (Using an external flash drive that had the windows installer on it with the install.esd file.)

RESPONSE: Error: 2 Unable to access the image. Make sure that the image path and the Windows directory for the image exists and you have read permission on the folder.

3)chkdsk /r

RESPONSE: File system is NTFS. cannot lock current drive. Would you like to dismount the drive. To which I say yes but I believe nothing happens since I'm in WinPE.

I have spent a lot of time trying to figure out 2 and why it cant access the image. It doesnt look like there are any restore points and reset (where files are kept) doesn't work according to them. Any help is appreciated. I'm guessing I gotta just reformat or there is some big hard drive issue.

All fans spun. Heard a click from the psu. Wasn't enough long enough for the debug codes on the mobo to start up.

I panicked. Naturally.

Grabbed a different psu from my other build (Seasonic Focus Plus Gold 1000w) and tried that. Same thing. Tried a different psu (Seasonic Focus 650w) to no avail.

My family just got a new router and service from Xfinity which has speeds up to 600 mbps. However we had to relocate the new router to a less central place in our home to connect it to a coax cable. This relocation has rendered the wifi in allot of the house non existant or very slow. I found a secondary coax cable on the other side of the home, I plugged the router in there and it works almost as well in the first location. My question is, If i get a network extender that connects to that second coax cable would it successfully boost the wifi on the other side of the house or not?

Also if any of you have any suggestions for reasonably priced Coax network boosters I would appreciate it.

fqw8gm,embeddedmonk20,Will a wireless adapter for PC desktop help with slow Ethernet download speeds?,"I do not have fiber optic internet. Though, my PC is hardwired to the gateway (C1000A to be exact) that is wired to a router. The line is split in 2 to allow other hardwired connections. On average, I see \~1.3 MB/sec when I try to download something from Steam. When I do download over Ethernet, it slows down the entire connection, both the Ethernet and wireless. The wireless connection seems to be alright or better since I just updated a router. So, there is less overwhelm for the amount of devices (I live with multiple people). I didn't update anything from the provider. This has me thinking a possibility: if I use a wireless adapter for my PC, will it lead to faster download speeds because the wireless connection is better? If that does not work, is there a way that I can download without slowing down the entire network?

I doubt that it will make a difference if I do get an adapter because it's just the wireless portion of my internet that got resolved and nothing else. I also still suspect that it would drastically slow down the network if I did download via wireless adapter as well. However, I just want to ensure that I am not looking over a simple solution.

fqvu48,spillingTheBean,My Laptop stutters every few seconds and it's driving me crazy,"As the title says, my laptop stutters about every 2 seconds. I have not timed the stutter, but as far as I can tell, the amount of time between stutters is always the same.

Specs

Processor: AMD A8-7410 APU with AMD Radeon R5 Graphics 2.20 GHz

OS: Windows 10 Pro version 1903 Build 18362.720


A brief timeline of what my machine has been through these past few months: originally, my laptop became extremely slow to the point of non-functionality late last year. After taking it to IT help at my university, they found that my C drive was running at 100% even when nothing was going on. They decided to do a clean boot, and after I got a couple files off, they reinstalled windows.

Not long after, I created an Ubuntu partition to make things easier for c programming for class. I think the stutter started either just before or just after I made this partition. Oddly enough, the stutter only occurred on the windows partition, never on the Ubuntu partition.

As time went on, both the windows partition and the ubuntu partition became corrupted, and when they both became unusable, the IT guys guessed that it was likely that my Hard Drive was failing. So I replaced it with a 256 gig SSD. Initially, the stutter was gone, but about 5 minutes after booting it for the first time, it suddenly rebooted, and the stutter was back.

I've looked all over to try to find help, but I haven't been able to find anyone with this issue of regular stutter on the OS level. It's all either in specific games/applications, or an irregular stutter. If anyone needs more information I will do my best to answer promptly.

fqvto6,BCArbalest,Boot drive not detected about 50% of the time,"Hey all,

In November one day i got up to load my PC and it wasnt detecting any OS. After faffing for a bit i removed the SSD into a caddy and discovered the drive had died and was totally unresponsive. I threw another spare drive in and installed Windows, however during install the drive wouldnt always be detected at start up and it made installing a nightmare. After several hours i had a run where it detected ok all the way through and i got it on. However since then the system has been unstable, with the occasional BSOD (About once every 2 or 3 weeks), and occasionally hanging and being unresponsive.

The main issue i have is that about 50% of the time my hard drive is not detected at all, and so it fails to boot, so i CrtlAltDel and restart and go through the loop until it does. Very occasionally it errors at boot and i get a message saying something like ""Inaccessible boot device"" i think?

At POST i can see the hard drives, i have 2 storage and one SSD for the OS. The other 2 are detected every single time, its just the SSD that is a problem. Ive tried multiple cables and different ports on the Mobo. The hard drive came out my laptop which i had no issues with so i dont think that the hard drive is at fault. Recently a bunch of my Steam games all stopped working and i suspect even though theyre installed to a storage drive its related to this. Ive ordered a new PC but want to clean this up and gift it to my father so that he can play Championship Manager during the ongoing health shenanigans, but dont want to pass it over while its playing up.

Any advice on how to trouble shoot this?",1,1585440467,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqvto6/boot_drive_not_detected_about_50_of_the_time/,techsupport,1

I mostly play fortnite, world of warcraft: classic, and escape from tarkov.  I've noticed that my games will freeze for approximately 1 second. With fortnite in particular, sometimes textures will not load in for whole towns in the game. When I try to enter these untextured locations, the game will not let me move through them. For world of warcraft, sometimes my interface will just disappear like I was hiding it to take a screenshot and I need to restart the game to get it back.

One thing I have noticed is that while gaming, my CPU and GPU are at 100% usage the whole time. The HD and  ram are generally steady at a much lower percentage. I don't know if the CPU and GPU were at 100% usage in the past when I was not having performance issues because I wasn't checking. I've tried reducing the settings in these games, but it made no difference.

fqv21u,Husbento,I cannot open anything,"I recently got my PC and finally decided to run it once I had a functioning mouse and keyboard; however, I ran into a problem almost immediately. I had this PC built at another company as I was worried about damaging the parts and they informed me that everything was running perfectly once they completed the build, that there were no issues with the boot ups and whatnot; however, I’m running into this issue of being unable to even access my settings because I’m unable to open up anything once I click on it. It only displays a minimized window that shows its open; however doesn’t open it on the desktop screen. 

Additionally, whenever I boot up the pc, instead of sending me to like that Windows screen before you log into the computer officially, it sends me straight to my desktop. I don’t know if that means anything to anyone, but it stood out to me because I’m used to having to at go through that if I want to log into a pc. 

I’m not the greatest in terms of working with technology, I’ve tried to do a hard reset with CTRL-ALT-Delete and it immediately sent me to a black screen... but ten minutes later I was back to the same desktop screen with nothing changed. 

If anyone can help me, I’d greatly appreciate it! I’ll do my best to answer questions if possible!

This is his speedtest results: [https://ibb.co/cbsFrZk](https://ibb.co/cbsFrZk)  
So as to my understanding he should be available to download much more than a max of 100kb/s.  
My research I've come across posts saying its due to speedtest valuing the users speed as bits not bytes, but I'm still not too clear if this issue is of the same thing. Sorry if my question is really dumb but it just confuses me and would hope someone can clear this up for me?

Normally I wouldn’t give a shit but I’m at uni and need to contact people in my group project (due this week) and I forgot their names lol. We had a group chat on my old messenger account rip.

Paired with ryzen 5 1600 af, windows 10 pro. Ram is actually a 2x8 kit, not 1x16.



After installing/updating windows and amd drivers, I noticed in the task manager only 8gb of ram was being recognized. Additionally, there's a lack of any specifications on the ram speed or manufacturer, etc. Enabling XMP in BIOS causes it to turn on and off twice with no video output then successfully boots on the 3rd try.

What's weird is that 16gb of memory is being shown in the BIOS (is the latest version) and in CPU-z but not in task manager.

After noticing half the ram was being recognized I tried reseating both sticks, slot 2 and 4. Same result, then tried each stick at a time in slot 2 (then 4, also tried 1 in 3), both times the system just black screens with only 1 stick. I would try slot 1/3 but the cooler is blocking slot 1 and I'm not sure if it would fix it.

Also tried looking at the ram from the cmd prompt:

Not sure what's causing this, some google searching shows that some people's task manager didn't show correct ram after updating windows.",13,1585436466,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fquotb/half_of_installed_ram_showing_in_w10/,techsupport,1

On boot (if I don't access the BIOS), it says ""preparing automatic repair"" under the Aorus logo which runs for a couple of seconds, then says ""diagnosing your PC"" for a couple of seconds, then goes to a blue screen that says ""Your PC did not start correctly"". If I restart from this menu, the cycle basically repeats. I can't get any of the advanced options from this menu to solve the problem either. I'm not sure what to do.

One thing I notice is that my GPU is not listed under the ""information"" tab in the top left, but I'm not sure if that's because it wouldn't normally be, or if that's my problem.

I'm now working from home and am quite worried since I'm unable to take my computer in with everything being closed - it has begun BSOD'ing fairly frequently and sometimes get's stuck in boot loops.

I've run direct x diagnostics, command console DISM, memtest for 9 hours and have seen no signs of errors or issues.

I've found a major warning spam right before the error in Events Viewer (the computer has rebooted from a bugcheck).

Should I uninstall this driver? I was unable to find a new driver for this.

I turned off my CPU OC option in the BIOS and am repairing Windows back to a fresh install to see how it goes.

EDIT: That seems to have done the trick.

I reset Windows entirely, and set everything back up the same. I have a Ryzen 1800x and Asrock x370 Taichi motherboard. I am also using a USB wireless headset, the RIG 800LX. 

Audio is perfectly fine on the PC, except for in-game audio. When I play Overwatch, Call of Duty, or League of Legends the in-game audio will cut out at random times for short periods and then come back; during this, the rest of my PC’s audio is perfectly fine. Discord calls, YouTube videos, etc. never cut out, only the game audio has this issue.

This issue also occurs when I use my PC’s speakers which are connected to my PC’s rear audio jack.

I have tried uninstalling all the audio drivers I had installed and reinstalling, using multiple different speakers and headsets connected to various ports on my PC, and uninstalling and reinstalling nVidia drivers.

I have no idea how to troubleshoot this from here, this issue is constant and makes any games unplayable. I also am not sure why the game audio is the only thing cutting out. Any and all help is appreciated.

My computer has been turning off after a recent upgrade I made.  I think I know the issue, I just need a second opinion, but first, the specs:

Motherboard: ASRock X37 Killer SLI/ac

CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1800X 8-core

GPU: Radeon RX 580

PSU: Thermaltake 650W Bronze

I have dual screens, sometimes stream, and take up most of my USB outlets.

My issue is that during Borderlands 3 specifically (My most intensive game), my computer has been turning off.  I downloaded a core temperature monitor, but I didn't see anything wrong with the temperature.  My recent realization is that it might be an issue with not enough power.  I pulled up an estimator for my build and it runs around 530W, so my initial thought is that I'm fine, but the power supply is guaranteed at least 80% efficient, so I'm thinking that during the most intensive times during the game, it just isn't getting enough power, and turns off.  I would just like a second opinion or if anyone thinks of something else before I commit to buying a more expensive PSU (Which wouldn't be an issue, as it is now the oldest thing in my build).

fqtaxu,Pegart,"Brand new hard drive (Toshiba P300, 4 TB, 5400 RPM) making suspicious clicking noise","I've recently bought a new HDD and noticed it's making suspicious clicking noise. The clicking is not constantly present but it sometimes does persist even when the HDD not being actively used (copying to/from, using it by any program etc.) and when idle (might be used by Windows processes though IDK). It stops only when the drive goes into standby mode.

I ran it through SeaTools which said the drive was OK. Ran it through Toshiba's Storage Diagnostic Tool which also didn't find anything wrong - funnily enough the clicking sound wasn't present during the tests but started immediately after the tests were done. It seems fine otherwise as copying to and from it looks OK, though at times it gets busy for no apparent reason. IDK if Windows 7 is doing something on a system level but I've never experienced anything similar and I've bought my fair share of HDDs through the years.

The drive was delivered to me by post so it might have been handled without proper care which makes me worried.

Mods allowed me to post the audio files through SoundCloud so you can hear how it sounds. Maybe someone will get a better idea if it sounds faulty or fine.

Audio 1 - background noise is my computer so ignore that, then you can hear intermittent write/read sounds that are normal and the third type of noise of constant clicking: https://soundcloud.com/user-836814447/1a-1/s-XJd9Pr5gNYe

Audio 2 - less background noise, but again similar with normal write/read sounds and constant clicking noise: https://soundcloud.com/user-836814447/2a-1/s-ahtSkfrB0PK

Audio 3 (careful with headphones at around 5 seconds, loud noise, sorry) - normal sounds with the weird clicking starting at around 10 seconds: https://soundcloud.com/user-836814447/3a-1/s-nDN1FhuPSXS

It seemed to me like CPU was overheating so I took a look and it turns out the thermal paste was completely dried out so I replaced it and did the stress test again. Still had the same issue but my PC lasted a while longer. First test ran for about 3mins while second run was about 8mins.

What do you think could be the problem? Is GPU or PSU potentially just needing replacement?

fqt1pk,intolerablewebsite,PC power issue,"(hopefully relevant) Components:
PSU: Seasonic SS-650KM
GPU: R9 fury nitro (air cooled)
CPU: i5 3570k
MOBO: ASRock P67 Pro3

Obviously a pretty aged build. 

I tend to leave my PC on overnight. Yesterday morning it was off, and wouldn't turn on. It was plugged into a power strip, which was functioning properly. Directly into the wall outlet didn't help, different power cord didn't help. Checked the seating of all connections. Decided it was likely a PSU failure, since there was no response at all from the PC, so I ordered a new one (Corsair CX 550) -- still doesn't power on. I know the fury is pretty power hungry; would that be an issue? Just hoping someone could point me in the right direction with diagnostics/troubleshooting so I don't end up throwing more parts at it.

fqt1ht,SrZiino,Is it the game or is it my internet?,"I play fortnite, dont need to judge. The past days I cant play at all because when I'm in the game I start lagging pretty bad.

In the game on the side of the screen it tells you your ping as well as how stable the connection is being a straight white line. That line will move or turn yellow sometimes and I notice I would start lagging. 

What I notice is that depending on some actions that I do in the game the connection will act like that, making me think is not the internet but the game.

Let's say in the game I emote, the exact moment I do it, I'm unable to move and that white line turns yellow and the game freezes.

But it makes no sense as my friends and I watch people play on media platforms not experiencing this. My computer is powerful enough as well.

This issue started a week ago and I been playing this game for years.

Already reinstalled and nothing seems to fix this.

fqsuzo,PFunk_Redds,Problems with Fullscreen and auto-minimization,"Hello! This is my first post on this subreddit, and I come with a question about how Mac OS deals with fullscreen tabs.

I am attempting to stream minecraft gameplay with my mac. I have everything set up and ready with OBS and all that, but I have a little quirk that I'd like to iron out. Basically, I have two monitors in use while I stream, my built in retina display with the MacBook pro laptop, and my external dell monitor. There are no issues with either monitor, and it my setup works beautifully. But when I try to use fullscreen on my external monitor, things get a little weird. For instance, if I have minecraft fullscreen on my external monitor, I can still see my built in display, and all of the open applications. But when minecraft loses focus and I click another application on the built in display, minecraft minimizes into the dock. This also goes vice versa with the monitors. What I would like to happen is minecraft not to minimize and stay where it is on the screen rather than minimize and show the desktop background. If minecraft is not fullscreen, it still loses focus but doesn't shrink into the monitor.

Is there a way to change this feature, or do I have to live with it?",0,1585430509,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqsuzo/problems_with_fullscreen_and_autominimization/,techsupport,1

fqst5i,BlackflagsSFE,Having a PSU problem. It won't supply power to the motherboard now but it DID once. Please help.,"Alright, so I am helping a friend upgrade a few parts in the computer he already has. The computer he has is a [Dell Inspiron 3487](https://www.cnet.com/products/dell-inspiron-3847-core-i5-4460-3-2-ghz-8-gb-1-tb-led-18-5/). I bought him a [1070](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Support-Graphics-08G-P4-6173-KR/dp/B01GX5YWAO) and a [600w PSU](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/evga-600w-atx-12v-eps-12v-80-plus-power-supply-black/8511029.p?skuId=8511029). He put everything together yesterday and the computer did not start up. He was taking pictures and sending them to me and my FIRST thought was the jumper cables. He didn't have them hooked up. He finally got them hooked up and nothing. My next suggestion was to reset the CMOS battery. He did this while we were on FaceTime and VOILA, he hit the power button and everything lit up and fans came on. Now, we never checked it to see if it would post, because he told me when it started he hadn't installed the graphics card yet. I told him to hold down the power button and shut it off. It wouldn't, so I had him flip the switch on the PSU. Now, I know things CAN happen, but to my knowledge, this should NOT compromise a PSU. Moving on, he installed the GPU and NOTHING. Reset the CMOS and NOTHING. He took the GPU back out, reset CMOS and NOTHING. I had him try with one RAM stick in, NOTHING. Try the other RAM stick, NOTHING. No green light on the motherboard, no fans, NOTHING. So next I told him to try the other PSU from the Dell (all of this went in a new case). I told him to just hook up the 24 pin ATX and the 4 pin. He hit the button on the back of the PSU (it has a button with a green light, not a switch) and WITHOUT hitting the power button, FANS ON. Alright, so I told him to do the SAME thing with the new PSU. NOTHING. Next, I wanted to rule out if the PSU was in fact DEAD. I had him take a paperclip and make a constant loop from green to black and flip the switch to see if the fan comes on. IT DID! The PSU fan came on so I ruled out that the PSU itself is NOT DoA, considering it gave power into the motherboard and ALL the components EXCEPT the GPU, which was only ONE TIME. I had him hook it to the 24 pin and 4 pin again, NOTHING. I thought the jumpers might be wrong, but he hadn't touched them from before. The NEXT thing we had him try was removing the motherboard and do a breadbox test, just to see if anything was shorting. NOTHING. It seems that the motherboard is not fried if the old PSU is kicking fans on, because if it were we wouldn't get anything.

So now, I am searching and coming up empty. So, my question is: Does anyone have a clue what could be going wrong here and how I should have him TEST it next? My gut is telling me there is a SHORT happening somewhere, but I don't have enough electrical experience yet (EE pre-major) to really rule this thing out. From what I understand, PSUs are rated for MAX power and only put out what is needed. I also don't see how the GPU would have effected the PSU not pushing power to all components because the RECOMMENDED settings is a 500w. This should push all these components just fine. Could the PSU be TOO MUCH for the board and the components? My gut is telling me no, especially if PSUs work like I mentioned above. I have gotten him to try just about everything I really know, so now I am turning to you all. PLEASE help me. He can't just run out and get another PSU since he is in Cali and they are on lockdown. I can ship him another PSU (the same one, bought 2 by mistake) Monday but then I would be out money and have to deal with RMAs, shipping costs, etc. ANY help would be GREATLY appreciated!

Edit 1: Spelling and added a couple more pieces of info to be accurate!

Edit 2: A guy in live TechSupport chat was telling me this is a D Tier PSU and is not recommended. I am thinking of getting a different one, but I don't understand why it wouldn't power just the motherboard and fans. He said it could be a VOLTAGE problem, which makes sense, but in that case, why would the old PSU power the board but not the new one?",0,1585430355,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqst5i/having_a_psu_problem_it_wont_supply_power_to_the/,techsupport,1

fqsq7t,Yorgi93,Cycling power...sometimes,"I've always been able to do research online and troubleshoot myself but I am kind of at a loss right now and hope this is the subreddit to post this on. I have never really had any issues with my pc since upgrading it in the mid summer of 2019 but the other day, two days ago, I was sat at my desk inside a virtual classroom for school when I bent over to grab my laptop I bumped my pc. Kind of hard but I am certain I've hit it with the same force before and never had any issue. This time my pc totally froze, the voice of my professor stuttering like it was crashed and it was. So I power off my pc using the button on the front and start it back up, hoping that it was nothing more than a restart to fix. When I pressed the button again to power it back up, the pc would cycle to try to turn on for about a second then turn back off for about 2 seconds. I haven't tried to let this go for very long anytime that it has  happened, instead opting to turn off the machine, press the PSS switch on the back and unplugging it. 

The most success that I had seemed to happen when I tried unplugging my cpu power cord and plugging that back in. After I had done this, the pc started back up like normal. The next day, yesterday, I went to start it again and again I was cycling power. Trying to go through the same steps as before, when I plugged back in my cpu cord nothing seemed to change and the cycling continued. When it got working again after letting it sit for a while I played games, did homework, researched the issue and kind of went about my day. After about 6-8 hours of that (sorry im a potato) the pc crashed again and I tried following the original steps to start it back up. It being late, I decided to tap out and leave it off and unplugged overnight. 

Today, I waited a few hours before trying anything, the side of my case was removed and I had to unplug and re-plug it in for the pc to boot up. Once I got it working I was talking to my friends on discord, hoping to play some games when I bent over to put the side of the case back on only to come out from under the desk to a crashed pc. Again I tried unplugging the PSS and the cpu, from the motherboard and the PSS but that didn't help. I unplugged some peripheral cables too, just in case, and it started back up after that. 

From what I've gathered I think its a heat issue but I don't really know how to check if thats the case. Between letting it sit to I guess ""cool down"" to make it work, and it instantly crashing with the case side on I am at a loss. This having started from a bump to the side of the case has me even more confused and wondering if I just need to reseat some of my components. All of my internal fans are running, but if I remember correctly, when I tried to turn up the speed of the fans through the button on my case, my pc crashed during that time as well so thats something that I am afraid to try.

Any help or thoughts on this would be wonderful and I am again hoping this is the right subreddit for this sort of thing.",2,1585430090,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqsq7t/cycling_powersometimes/,techsupport,1

fqslpo,milkku4,Monitors' colours changes when opening League of Legends,"So basically when I open League of Legends my monitors' colours change to weird saturated colours. I have windows 10.

**What happend?**

A few days ago I opened my pc and monitors normally and I noticed the colours were weird. Last use of them was the night before and I had shut down my monitors and pc without changing any setting or pressing any monitor buttons. The colours were weird in every game and on desktop as well. At first I tried to fix it by using the monitors' own settings from the side buttons. It did not help. I also tried to reset the monitor settings back to factory settings which also didn't help. After that I decided to change my nvidia colour settings (lowered gamma ratio) which fixed the problem. 

After that I opened League and realized the colours were weird again. Then I manually changed the nvidia settings (changes explained in step 1)(note: different change than the gamma one). League ignores these changes and turns the colours back to weird. This is what I'm stuck at now: I have to manually fix the colours from nvidia control panel after opening League.

The problem occurs only when I open League of Legends. I have tested Minecraft and Overwatch but both show no signs of problems. 

**How have I tried to fix this problem?** (terms used are straight translations, sorry for that.)

1. Changing nvidia settings. NVIDIA control panel -&gt; navigate desktop colour settings. I changed the dot from ""other applications can navigate the colour settings"" to ""use NVIDIA settings"". Repeated on both monitors. (When the colours turn odd the dot from ""use NVIDIA settings"" doesn't physically move to ""other applications can navigate the colour settings"" even though the colours change as they would be set to ""other applications can navigate the colour settings""). Basically: dot doesn't move but the setting still changes on it's own.
2. Changing nvidia settings. NVIDIA control panel -&gt; change resolution. I changed the dot from ""use default colour settings"" to ""use NVIDIA's colour settings"". Repeated on both monitors.
3. Updated my monitors' drivers.
4. Repeated the first 3 steps listed on this thread:  [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/discover/239606/finally-a-fix-for-the-games-changing-the-color-profiles-/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/discover/239606/finally-a-fix-for-the-games-changing-the-color-profiles-/) 

**NOTE:** the problem occured when I only had one monitor. A few days later my other monitor arrived from the mail and now the problem occurs on both monitors. (I'm right now using both).  I wrote the post as having two monitors to make my problem a bit more easier to understand.

Keep in mind that my native language isn't English and I tried to keep this post as simple as possible. Thank you for your time. 

**TL;DR** \- My monitor changed its colour settings on its own. Fixed it by changing gamma ratio from nvidia settings. Then I opened League and noticed the colours were off again. I have to manually change the nvidia settings to get them back to normal.",4,1585429694,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqslpo/monitors_colours_changes_when_opening_league_of/,techsupport,1

I must apologise first as this is my first ever Reddit post, but I am starting to lose my rag with my computer.

So the problem, for a good few weeks now, I can't remember the exact start date of this problem, but I would think that it has only started occurring in March 2020. In every game that I have played recently (Warframe, CSGO, Space Engineers) at random intervals the screen goes black (mostly, sometimes other colours), then crashes to desktop. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for the crashes. However I can mostly replicate the crash when trying to complete this one mission in Warframe - 90% of the time is crashes on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to sway any advice given, but it seems like it started crashing when I updated Windows. The first this I noticed after I updated it was that when I opened Google Chrome, it came up with the Aw Snap! page, and all the extensions crashed. I looked up a fix for this, which was to add --disable-features=RendererCodeIntegrity in the Target: box in the Properties. This seemed to fix the issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Computer Specifications:

\- Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

\- i7-6700 CPU @ 3.40 GHz

\- NVidia 980 Ti

\- 32 GB RAM

\- Razer Naga Chroma Mouse

\- PC is around 4 years old

\- Need anymore information I can share.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I've tried:

\- Memtest - Came back with no errors

\- 3DMark - Ran perfectly okay

\- Updated all drivers - Including Graphics Card

\- Uninstalled Windows updates from March (however I left the Security ones alone)

\- Ran the games with Game Boost on using IOBit Driver Booster program

\- Uninstalled Razer Synapse completely - But still occurred so reinstalled

\- Uninstalled and Reinstalled the games listed

\- Used CCleaner and Advanced System Care to scan the computer and fix any issues

\- Tried the SFC /Scannow in Command Prompt (Admin) &amp; PowerShell (Admin)

&amp;#x200B;

Any help on this issue will be massively appreciated. I'm at my wits end with it.",0,1585429598,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqskks/random_sudden_crash_to_windows_when_playing_games/,techsupport,1
fqsjnc,Ares12480,Guys solve this problem,"So reddit is not letting me post any pictures but I will provide it to anyone who wants it. So there was this problem with my all in one pc that it's screen would go off after almost 20 mins of using it. All temps were normal. But figured out that there was a small heatsink attached to the mobo of the pc which was heating like hell. So I had two fans in my all in one pc which were designed to cool the heat pipes from the processor (both of em) so i detached the secondary  fan from its place and pointed it towards the heatsink and put some duct tape to keep it facing the heatsink. This stopped the going off of screen!!!!!! But this is only a temporary solution and my pc is also lacking one of the fans. Please note my cover is open and I want some permanent solution to reassemble my all in one again. Pls note that I cannot add an extra fan to the pc because since it's an all in one pc the space is very cramped plus on closing the cover there is very less space between the cover and the stuff attached to mobo. Pls help me find a permanent solution to this problem. Thank you guys in advance.

Weirdly the upload speed stays stable sometimes. It sometimes comes back by itself or after a while or doesnt at all. I usually fix it by restarting the modem (technicolor cga4233tch3), or by calling the ISP, they fix it sometimes but after a while it dies again.

Recently ive found that unplugging the ethernet cable that goes to a desktop pc (turned on), and plugging it back fixes it, so i been doing that every 30 minutes for a couple of days.

I know its probably an ISP issue, but they have changed all the cables arround my house, given me a new modem, an the problem continues. I dont know what else they coud do, so ive come here to see if I can do something myself or if someone knows something. As we are in quarentine im stuck in my house with this faulty internet, so is kinda annoying, and got nothing to lose...

This took some time as my pc was just turning off at any moment and taking me to a blue recovery screen. After force powering off my machine it would sometimes boot me back into my desktop successfully. We then tried to reinstall windows/update it with an iso he got from Microsofts website. It got as far as around 89 percent and then my pc restarted with a message stating it was reverting back to windows before changes were made. He then told me theres nothing else to be done by him and its a hardware issue. Then told me to take it to a tech shop to get it sorted. This is impossible at the moment as my countries in lockdown. Is there anything i can do or check on my pc to try and find out what it is?

fqs4d8,PhantomFlayer,Blank Screen before and after using Windows 10 Media Creation Tool,"The problems started yesterday morning. I’m pretty sure my HDD died. When I tried to boot it, all I got was a blank screen. My display was on and lit, but it was completely blank. Not even a cursor. 

Luckily, I have a friend who’s more knowledgeable about computers than me. I have an SSD that I haven’t used yet, so he tells me to install Windows 10 on it using a flash-drive with media creation tool on it. 

After downloading the tool on a separate pc and booting it on my pc, it starts configuring it. Using my friend’s help, I partitioned and formatted my SSD, and set windows to install on the primary partition. 

I wait for the installation process to finish, but right after it gets to the last step (finishing updates, I think?) it says windows needs to restart. Windows restarts, and the Windows logo pops up along with a loading circle. A few second later, it goes blank. Just like before.

I try restarting. Doesn’t help. I try booting the flashdrive again. Now it’s blank too after the same windows logo and loading circle. I try reinstalling media creation tool and booting the flash-drive again. The tool works again, so I select repair pc, but it says there is nothing to repair. So I press the shut down button so I can try to reinstall Windows, but upon booting the flashdrive again, it goes blank. 

I don’t know what else to try. I don’t have access to windows so I can’t use task manager or command prompt. All I have is the BIOS and the creation tool when it’s working. Any Help would be greatly appreciated.

fqs48w,InventedAcorn,Looking to move my router/modem to a better location.,"We are currently with Cincinnati Bell’s Fioptics. Our modem and router are both ISP provided. When installing the hardware (several years back), they decided to install them both in the basement and on the ceiling. This wasn’t a big issue until recently moving my Xbox up to my room. Now, connection is slow and moving our router closer to all our connections would be an easy fix for faster speed. 

Now, the problem is how they hooked up everything. We have a TV in the basement, and one on the second story. It appears that the Fioptics box by each TV (to turn on the channels and stuff?) is connected through a single cord in the wall that runs inside the house interior. This means I cannot move the router somewhere else, because these cables are being run inside the house walls. 

My question is, am I able to move my router and modem at all? I don’t see how I’ll be able to do so without having to run wires through the house. These cables appear to be connected to the router (if the router is the box with the antenna). Please, if you need a more in-depth idea of the situation, I can take pictures or videos to show you.

fqrvwh,libjohn,Random Freezing and Strange Behaviour with Ryzen 2700x PC,"I built a PC a while ago (see below for full specs) but have had non stop issues with it since the beginning. If I use all of the stock 'auto' settings in the BIOS it immediately freezes after boot (at the windows login screen). The only thing I have had any success with to get it to run with any stability is setting the vcore voltage manually to a sensible value (currently set to 1.344V). I does however, still freeze up on me and behaves a little strangely. I am bit stumped and any help / suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Some strange behaviour that I have noticed:

* The BIOS auto settings set the vcore very high. At least 1.45.
* Ryzen Master shows that the 'EDC' is very high. Almost always in red and over 100%, sometimes as high as 160%. Lowering the vcore does help bring the EDC down a little bit. Do I need to be concerned with this? I am not too familiar.
* Applying a profile in Ryzen master doesn't do anything. The current settings remain the same.
* GPU benchmarks e.g. superposition run OK with \~ 70FPS but other GPU tasks e.g. trying to train a neural network causes everything to grind to a halt.
* When using a manually set score of 1.3-1.35 to make the machine stable enough to use and bring the EDC down, the CPU usage reported by windows doesn't ever get above 90%, even when running a benchmark e.g. cinebench or rendering something in blender.

Some things that I have tired so far:

* Changing windows power plans. A lot of people recommend checking it is on balanced (what I am using now) but this appeared to have no effect at all.
* Setting the vcore voltage manually. This is the only thing which helps. It made the machine bootable and usable but still freezes and struggles. Auto mode causes it to hover around 1.45 when idle and go even higher.
* Checked temperatures. Generally very good. It hardly gets hot.
* Updated the BIOS.
* Disabled 'cool n quiet'
* Disabled 'Precision Boost Overdirve'
* Tested the RAM
* Changed the RAM speed/frequency (currently 2144 MHz).
* Checked the chipset drivers are up to date.
* Using only one DIMM slot (I have only one in use at the moment).
* Moving the RAM to a different slot.
* Resetting / clearing the CMOS.
* Downgrading a BIOS version.

This seems like a really simple problem, but I'm getting nowhere with it.


So it's pretty common to have the F keys on the top of your keyboard also control various system functions (change volume, screen brightness, etc). Usually this is set up so that, for example; pressing F1 just does whatever it's supposed to do. But holding fn and pressing F1 will mute sound.


Apparently HP thought it would be cool to reverse this so that F1 by itself is mute, but if I'm using a program or playing a game that uses the F1 key, I need to also hold down fn. This is extremely annoying. 


Looking through various websites, the two main solutions I've come across are to either change settings in the bios, press and hold a series of keys to toggle it, or have a keyboard with a key that toggles this. 

My bios simply doesn't have the options that a lot of these websites assume it does. I can find nothing regarding action keys or function keys. My keyboard just doesn't have an fn lock button, so that's out.  And pressing different combinations of shift, alt and the function key hasn't done anything yet. HP support was extremely unhelpful, basically telling me I had to pay more money for additional support or just buy a new keyboard. 

Is there some way that I can change something in the registry or trick my computer into thinking this button is always down or something?",10,1585427310,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqruf1/my_function_keys_are_stuck_need_to_hold_down_fn/,techsupport,2

fqrtd7,samiskyhigh,What could be the cause of this internet problem?,"Hey guys! So I have 25 mbps fiber network and basically it runs perfect, 4K videos work great and gaming is awesome, low ping and almost no packet loss, that’s until I play this game called Call of Duty Warzone. For those who haven’t heard of this game, it’s basically a huge Battle Royale where 150 players fight to be the surviving team. This is where I get crazy packet loss, like 100 percent packet loss at most times, even though my ping just stays at an average 50ms. What could be causing these massive packet loss? I have a Huawei router, but it doesn’t connect to a modem, it basically has this blue fiber optic connector which I found out to be called ONT, could this router be the cause? Should I find a different router like a gaming router? Or maybe it’s time to upgrade to a faster internet to solve this problem?

The BSOD that appear are mostly system thread expectation not handled along with Memory managment. I've tried a few fixes that I found on youtube and some tech help websites the fixes include manually changing the page file I have tried letting windows automatically set this as well as manual setting it and also removing it altogether I have also tried to reset windows removing my own files as well. Currently I beleve it to be windows update/ windows store related as when it first became an issue if I prevented the windows store from downloading Forza horizon 4 it wouldn't crash, but then it started crashing again and i beleve this to be due to windows updating as I have been trying some of the recomened steps in youtube videos again and one was to update windows check for updates that kinda thing the second windows started to download the update it carshed and when I booted back up three or so more times after that as soon as I started the update it would crash instantly.

fqrj8c,Backrish,PC Frame drops,"Had this issue for a while now and kinda getting on my nerves since it's started to affect games I could always run perfectly fine a year ago. First had this issue with Battlefield V where I'd be playing and it'd be running perfect, but then every 10 seconds or so I'd get high packet loss and framerate would drop to 2 for a moment before bouncing back, became very frustrating so I just stopped playing that game after searching around, it came up again around the release of Mordhau again, to which it was again high packet loss, I believe this has something to do with internet connection or something, but on any other game it was fine and I ran another check using malwarebytes, nothing there, stopped playing that too.

Recently went to go and play another game, Dark Souls 3, and while that is on Multiplayer mostly, even on offline mode I'd get frames suddenly dropping and coming back up, I could run the game perfectly in the past long before the issue with BFV and the issue is coming up on most games I play now, I know my CPU is fine, I checked with CPU-Z, I wasn't sure how GPU-Z worked so I never got to check anything there but I used Task manager at least and found that my GPU is at 100% constantly, i read that this was normal but something feels odd about that. I will note that I run my games from an external hard drive, but I read that it would only effect the loading times rather than framerate, my hard drive isn't near full either.

Does anyone know what I can do with this? I think my GPU is at least 4 years old, same for my hard drive but I'm not sure if that would be of any use, I assume it's something to do with one of those two but I'm not great with knowing all the details about computers and what does what.

fqrc6j,RAMIssues1111,ASUS TUF GAMING B Channel Memory,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to be posting this particular problem in. If there is an other, more appropriate one, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

My part list:

&amp;#x200B;

ASUS X570 TUF GAMING PLUS

AMD Ryzen 5 3600X

Corsair Vengeance LPX 2x8GB (CMK16GX4M2B3200C16 - compatible according to ASUS' QVL)

&amp;#x200B;

So this one is a bit of a doozy. Motherboard \*will not\* post into BIOS if there is RAM in either the B1 or B2 memory channels. It will only post, and successfully boot into Windows 10, if memory is slotted into either the A1 or A2, or both, memory channels.

&amp;#x200B;

When the RAM \*is\* in memory channels A1 and/or A2, performance is limited to 2133 Mhz. I can use ASUS' D.O.C.P. to (theoretically) boost this up to its intended 3200 Mhz, but I'm not sure its actually using it (I'm running a MemTest86 as of writing this). According to [userbenchmark.com](https://userbenchmark.com) the performance is ""performing way below expectations - as one would expect if the RAM slotted incorrectly (userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25950054).

&amp;#x200B;

Ordinarily, I would simply return the MB and get another one, or the same one again, but I've read elsewhere that the issue may also be the CPU. I want to troubleshoot this before I take the more drastic step of refunding both.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess my actual question is this: is it even possible for this issue to be originating with the CPU, or did I just get a faulty motherboard? Considering that I have already returned a motherboard - having tried, unsuccessfully, the MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX, which would not post at all - I would like somebody else's input before I continue.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I nuked the Windows Install on my SSD, because I bought a 970 EVO and I would not like to install everything again...

fqqt17,TheFoxerNL,A weird stutter in both windows and games," 

I have a very annoying issue with my rig which makes me want to throw my pc out the windows sometimes.

I have terrible stutters in my games and windows. It happens with an interval of about 2 minutes and it varies in the severity. Sometimes my screen freezes for .1 seconds and other times 2 to 3 seconds.

I'm starting to lose hope to ever finding a fix, because I've already tried all the things I could find and think of online. Here is a list of things I have already tried:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hardware related.

I used to have an older rig in which the stutters first apeared (which is the main reason I upgraded to my current build). Thinking the stutter came from an old CPU I had I decided to upgrade the entire thing exept my hard drives and monitor (KINGSTON SSD 240GB 450/450 V300 and Seagate 1TB ST1000DM003 7200 SA3 with a Iiyama E2483HS-B1 monitor). All my other parts are new and working just fine, but to be safe I also checked my hard drives and they apear to be functioning normally.

2) Windows or NVIDIA driver issues.

With my new rig came a complete reïnstall of windows and several games. All drivers have been updated and I have not had any bluescreen or windows error.

3) Emptying cashes and temporary file saves.

4) Changing the 1's to 0's in the registry edit.

5) Internal Windows command prompts which could cause stutter.

A friend told me to try to turn off several windows features to see if the stutter got removed as this had been the case with him. He had turned of several features in CMD (1 at a time) and let me test if it had any effect. It did not and the changes were reverted. Also I'm not sure to what he specifically tested or typed into the CMD, but I trust him with my life, so I'm sure he did'nt do anything to break the PC or screw me over.

6) Turning the power settings to 'Performance' instead of 'Standard'.

7) Malware or virusses.

I have used a variety of malware/virusscanners and none found anything suspicious. I also checked if it was'nt caused by having several scanners at the same time which was not the case.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to also mention that I have used MSI Afterburner to see if anything happend during the freezes. The only thing I have noticed was out of the ordinary was that my GPU And PSU both dropped in output during the freeze, but only miliseconds after the freeze already happend. My guess is that when my screen stops, the Gpu doesnt need to proces the game for the duration of the freeze and when the freeze is over, it goes back to normal preformance.

It has been several months now and it really sucks the enjoyment out of using my PC.

&amp;#x200B;

My old rig was: GTX 970, 500W PSU, I7 4790 Intel CPU, MSI B85-G43 GAMING motherboard, and 16 Gigs of RAM.

My new rig is: RTX 2070 SUPER OC, AMD Ryzen 9 3900X CPU, Asrock X570 STEEL LEGEND motherboard, 750W PSU, G.Skill DDR4 Sniper-X 2x8GB 3200MHz RAM.

&amp;#x200B;

Could there be something wrong with the monitor? Is there a driver I missed? Anything to help would be much apreciated.

I also want to apologize in advance for any typo's, I'm dutch, and my English writing is'nt the best.",0,1585424023,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqqt17/a_weird_stutter_in_both_windows_and_games/,techsupport,1

fqqrlw,CanadianWhisk3y,"Recently upgraded my PC (Win10), now experiencing frequent BSOD","Last weekend, March 22nd, since I am working from home for the foreseeable future, I decided to bite the bullet and upgrade my PCs parts. Here is what I am running:

Motherboard: ASUS PRIME Z370-P II

CPU: Intel Core i7-9700k

RAM: 16GB DDR4

GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Super

SSD1: Samsung SSD 840 Pro Series (128GB)

SSD2: Samsung SSD 860 EVO (1TB)

HDD: WDC WD15EARS-22MVWB0 (1.5TB)

Win10 Education 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, one week later, I am experiencing frequent BSOD. BSOD mostly occurs when trying to login into Windows, opening/running a, internet browser, trying to launch games from Steam/Battle.net. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the steps I have taken so far:

 \- Opened Device Manager and checked every device, updated a few drivers

\- Went to Windows Update and updated as much as possible

\- Changed which PCI-E slot the GPU was in 

\- Since my previous GPU was AMD, and now I am running an Nvidia card, I uninstalled all AMD software and drivers leftover

\- I installed WhoCrashed to be able to read the minidump files

\- At this point, it was telling me the Intel(R) Display Audio Driver may be the issue

\- After researching how to fix this, as per a forum post on [answers.microsoft.com](https://answers.microsoft.com), I installed the latest version of Java, and downloaded, installed, and ran Intel Driver and Support Assistant

\- This tool recognized I was missing an Intel driver, but it was not the Display Audio Driver mentioned above.

\- Then I learned about using Driver Verifier Manager. I first selected the 3 drivers with &lt;unknown&gt;, but they did not have a value in the Faults Injected

\- At this point, I also started to notice my PC not powering on correctly. When powered off, I press the power on button, it lights up/pc powers on, then shuts off for about 2-3 seconds, then starts to fully power/boot.

\- Next I turned to Command Prompt. I ran sfc /scannow, and chkdsk /f /r c:

\- The sfc /scannow returned with a message saying Windows found a few corrupt files and repaired them

\- Ran Driver Verifier Manager again, this time selecting all non-Microsoft drivers. Restarted, inspected each one, and none of them had a value in Faults Injected

\- I created a new user environment variable which would allow me to see hidden/unused drivers in Device Manager. In DM, I then uninstalled every hidden device, which included some leftover AMD drivers and a duplicate Intel Audio Display Driver

\- During this whole process, my PC was BSOD frequently, so I checked WhoCrashed again, and now the main culprit seems to be [ntoskrnl.exe](http://www.google.com/search?q=ntoskrnl.exe). There was also one instance where the crash was caused by hal.dll (full logs down below)

\- Then through more research, I found out about Driver Booster. So Installed it and ran it, and it found some missing drivers, along with an Intel Display Audio Driver marked as ""faulty""

And that's pretty much where I'm at now. For the majority of this process, I was doing this in Safe Mode w/ Networking. My PC runs fine in safe mode, and now as I am writing this whole post in normal mode, things seem a bit more stable, but just before writing this, it BSOD at the login screen again. As I am writing this post in Chrome, which is making me anxious. Here are the full logs from WhoCrashed:

fqq6qq,Zeenie10,GPU failing? Diagnosis help pls,"Hello, I think my GPU is dying but I am not sure, as PC problems have changed over past few days.

I think the problem started after downloading CoD warzone. I was forced to update my driver to play (Adrenalin 2020 Edition 20.2.2 Recommended) for my Radeon R9 380. 

I played a few games, and it seemed really slow, low FPS even on lowest settings, but it was playable. I assumed my PC was just getting too old for these new titles. However I think the game was not fully installed during this game time as I saw the game continuing to install optimizing shaders and textures in the menu later on. Aftersitting idle in menu this finished and the game felt smoother and ran better. But my theory is by this time the damage was done to my GPU.

Since then I have been monitoring resouce usage a lot on task manager etc. and seen a few different things.

\-sometimes, sitting idle in game menu, near max memory usage (RAM, 8GB installed)

\- sometimes, idle menu memory usage was normal, but playing games causes memory usage to climb from regular amounts \~2gb to \~6gb and then drop suddenly back to regular. This caused freezing sometimes, but game audio suggested game was running fine behind the frozen screen. Had to force quit the game and restart. 

\-now currently, sitting idle in game menu near maxes GPU usage, but tabbing out this drops to \~30%, and entering a practice mode in game drops the GPU usage to \~70 or 80 % but CPU usage shoots up to 70% also. 

These problems are intermittent and inconsistent, sometimes occuring after an hour of playing, somtimes straight after booting up PC. Sometimes restarting sorted the problem temporarily.

Has my GPU died from playing Warzone with un optimized textures etc? Was my GPU forced to push workload onto RAM and now CPU to cope, as the damage to GPU memory is permeanant? Do i have any idea what i am talking about??? Pls help.",0,1585422013,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqq6qq/gpu_failing_diagnosis_help_pls/,techsupport,1

fqq3q0,ABabyPanda777,"PC is giving me a couple of graphical issues, nothing I have done has changed anything","Well, at least I think it is my GPU. Recently, I built a new PC using parts that I have been collecting since Black Friday. The only part that is not new is the PSU, but it is just 6 months old as I had to replace a broken one in my old PC at the time. I had no previous issues with it whatsoever. My specs are as follows:

Ryzen 5 3600

ASRock Fatality B450 Gaming-ITX/ac Mobo

16GB XPG Z1 3200MHz Ram

MSI RTX 2080 Super Ventus OC Edition

Corsair CX750M PSU

Focusrite Solo 2nd Gen

My two issues are that 1) For whatever reason, my pc will not allow me to run my 3 monitors at the same time. They are three different types of displays, but I have never seen that be a problem, and I never had an issue with my old PC and GPU, a GTX 980. One of my ""monitors"" is an Insignia 4K TV, another is an old Samsung 21"" 1080p monitor, and the last is a QNIX QX2710 1440P Monitor that I have to connect via an Active DVI-D to Display Port adapter. I figured that may be important information to getting to the bottom of these problems.

2) For whatever reason my PC is crashing when trying to play games at high resolutions (1440p and 4k). I ran the Unigine Heaven benchmark and had no issues. Also GTA V and Witcher 3 ran for a few minutes but I did not keep playing so I am not sure if it would have continued. On games like COD:MW and Farcry 5, it crashes as soon as the game boots. It is a full crash, and begins rebooting immediately. I was able to play a game at 1080p for whatever reason. I did not really look too deep into this because is does not really solve my problem. My PC is also not making a crash report in the Minidump file, when I set it to do just that.

Now, I have done a decent amount of tests but I am all out of Ideas. I have ran the benchmarks as I mentioned before, reseated the ram, unplugged the PSU cables and made sure they were secure, stress tested my CPU with Prime95. I have tried it with a different mix of monitors plugged in to different ports. I removed the drivers with a DDU software and tested this PC with my GTX 980 and everything gave me no issues. I thought I had finally come to the conclusion that I had a faulty GPU, so I returned the one I purchased and got a new one. Uninstalled my drivers, put the card in and reinstalled everything, and I get the same issue. This is where I gave up. I have no idea what this problem is and have googled endlessly to find a solution.

I bought this card and built the PC right as the quarantine was about to begin as I figured I would have a bunch of free time to play games, but instead I have been dealing with this headache the entire time. This entire time, I have had no issues using the pc for work or internet browsing. It runs perfectly fine for anything not gaming related.

I would like to add that I have a little bit of experience building PC's, I started doing it myself probably 8 years ago, but have only built (or repaired) about 3 systems. Last time was 4 years ago, however. I am not a novice, but nowhere near an expert.

My Specs:

CPU: AMD FX-8350 GPU: GTX 770          I've had this setup running since 2013

So what I have tried out sofar:

I booted in to safemode and deinstalled the graphicsdrivers via DDU. Then after that I loaded back into nomal Windows and tada everything seemed fine, then after a minute or two the Black Screen reoccured. So I figured Windows must be installing a graphics driver in the background. So back into Safemode, deinstalled drivers. And then booted back in to Windows without an internet connection. Tada the computer stayed on without any problems. So I figured it must be a Driver issue. I took my laptop and downloaded an old graphics driver from January 2019 and installed that one. And during the installation process the Black Screen reocurred and the computer was once more unresponsive. Then I took the graphics card out and put it in a different desktop (Desktop2), same problem. Then I took the graphicscard from Desktop2 and put it in my computer. And after installing those drivers it works completly fine. So my conclusion is, it is either a driver issue or something is wrong with the graphicscard s hardware.

So now I'm turning to you guys in the hops of finding a solution, that doesn't recure me to buy a new graphicscard.",0,1585421369,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqpzg0/windows_10_blackscreen_upon_boot/,techsupport,1

My setup consists of a Dell XPS 13 9380 and a Samsung C49RG90 monitor, connected via a 4k@60hz capable USB-C to HDMI dongle and the HDMI cable that came with the monitor.

TLDR: I want to share my keyboard, mouse, monitor and sound system between my gaming pc and macbook pro. What's the best way to do it? 

Apologize in advance if this isn't the right subreddit, but I wasn't sure where else to put this.

I have a windows 10 gaming pc and a mac book pro. My gaming pc is hooked up to my workstation, which consists of 1 monitor and a 5.1 surround sound system. This is the rig I have:

http://obutto.fr/12-64-thickbox/support-triple-ecran-pour-obutto-r3volution.jpg

I sometimes use my workstation to work with my laptop. To do this I unplug my monitor from my pc and plug it into my macbook pro. I have a separate keyboard and mouse for my macbook, so there's no other wires to unplug/plug. This allows me to share my monitor between two devices, but does not allow me to share the speakers or keyboard and mouse. It's really clunky, but it's not the end of the world, as I really only need to use the monitor for the extra screen space when working.

In the past I used a kvm (probably a couple of years ago). However I ran into problems with the kvm not supporting the same resolution and refresh rate as my monitor (144hz). It was okay for working but terrible for gaming. Also it still didn't allow me to share my sound system. I've also tried several software solutions that were really laggy, so i ditched them. This is why I've ended up with what I have.

Now I want to increase the amount of screen space I have for work. Two solutions are to 1) Get a bigger monitor, like an ultra wide one 2) Get 2 more monitors. If I get a bigger monitor I can continue with the existing setup of unplugging my monitor cable from the pc and plugging it into my mac. If I get more than one monitor than I'm not sure how I can share between pc and mac.

What are my options? How have other people solved this problem? Is there a way of sharing all monitors, keyboard, mouse and surround sound system between my pc and mac?",1,1585420186,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqpm3s/share_workspace_between_pc_and_laptop/,techsupport,1
fqpkl1,ReallyLegitToaster,Did A VPN Give Me a DMCA Notice?,"So I'm going to keep this brief because there isn't much really to say here.  I received a DMCA notice (complete with my name, from Comcast) that claimed I had used a Bittorrent client to download a file called ""Grand Theft Auto - Final Mod 2012"" and it was an infringement on copyright law in some way.  Now the weird thing is, I don't think I've even used a torrenting service in the past few years, and the only time I've ever recently played Vice City was through my android phone.

My question then, is, how is it possible to get hit with a DMCA notice if you've never done anything in the first place to get one? If I haven't used a P2P torrenting service and I haven't downloaded anything illegal on the day I received the message, what could be going on here.

My other question is, is it possible that by using a free VPN (OpenVPN) that I could in some way be tied to someone else's torrents that were done over VPN?  OpenVPN is a free VPN service that someone might use as a way to ""hide"" their identity and download torrents with, but if someone else was using it for that purpose, could it in some way lead back to me?

Then I tried switching the Ram back and nothing, I also tried going back to the original CPU but still nothing. Not sure what else to try or if I messed something up.  

Edit: Seems that the CPU is not compatible or it doesn't work, I switch back to the original for a second time just to make sure and it works now.

My PC is capable of running any game perfectly, it just started happening about a week ago and I have over a year with this PC. Is a connection issue.

I already reset my router, I already did a bunch of commands for CMD like flushdns, etc.

When it started:

So this all started when I decided that I wanted turn an old Lenovo thinkcentre M91P into a cheap gaming rig for my wife so we can play games together. I had an old gtx 1060 3gb laying around, so I figured I could do it for really cheap.

I bought a new power supply(600 W) and tower, moved the motherboard from the Lenovo case to the new tower, installed the gtx 1060 and bam, gaming PC for next to nothing. 

Everything works just fine except now the damn CPU fan is running at 100% all the time and I just can't get it to stop no matter what I try.

What I've tried so far:

The first thing I did was take off the heatsink, clean it, and reapplied thermal paste. Didn't help. I checked the CPU temp and it is running at a cool 30-35 C. So the CPU isn't overheating.

I flashed bios and reset cmos. Nothing. 

I replaced the CPU fan with a different one. It still ran at 100%.

I removed the graphics card and reverted back to the original Lenovo power supply. No change.

I tried running fan control software, but my motherboard doesn't support it. 

As a hail Mary, I reinstalled windows and installed the lastest updates. Nothing.

I've been having this problem for about 4 or 5 months, ever since I upgraded my CPU, my GPU, my case (though I don't think that matters), and my PSU. My PC will randomly force restart while playing certain games for certain durations. There's no errors, just a force reboot. At first I thought it was my CPU overheating, so I got a cooler for it, but the problem persists. I can usually play very graphically intensive games (Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 3, Shadow of the Tomb Raider) all pretty much without problems. However, there are some games that will restart at random times and AREN'T very graphically intensive. The biggest offender is Doom Eternal, which will restart on the menu screen or opening cutscene (even on the lowest graphic settings), and Overwatch, which will stay up for any time between 5 minutes and 5 hours.

I can't figure out what's wrong with my PC, please help! The only thing I can think of left is either a faulty PSU or having to upgrade my MoBo, which is still from my older build when I cheaped out on a lot of parts.

After replacing my PSU, which required some fiddling with the GPU and motherboard due to the way the PC was put together before, I have started to experience a low noise in my headphones that plays constantly when I turn a game on - and its volume is relative to how demanding the game is. The noise is barely audible when it's minimised, it's noticeable when in the main menu, and it's insufferable when I get into the proper game. It has no relation to the system audio volume - it's just as audible when I have it at 100 as when it's sitting at 0. It only occurs when I have the headphones hooked up to the front headphones jack and it's absent in the back speaker jack, but it's more convenient to have it in front and I've heard that it's better not to use the speaker jack for headphones.

fqo9kn,stoelwinder,Disable Store Mode or Demo Mode on Ariston Microwave Oven,"Hi all, I’m sorry if this question doesn’t belong here but i hope someone can help.

I have an Ariston MP796 IX A microwave oven combo and while cleaning the front display, a combination of buttons activated and my oven started beeping. Later I realized that it popped into some demo mode that’s used in stores and now it won’t heat and the features keep scrolling in the screen.

I’ve tried:
1.	Check Settings: there’s no option to disable demo mode, no option to factory reset either
2.	Switched off at the main for several days, but it just returns back into demo mode
3.	Checked the manual: no details about demo mode there
4.	Searched online for same, similar or even different model and brand ovens and checked for similar suggestions but none of the steps match anything on my model oven
5.	Contacted the Ariston agent for support and have been waiting for 2 weeks (multiple calls) to get a technician to give me instructions but they insist on a house visit (during the Covid-19 outbreak) next week
6.	Pressing random buttons for longer durations. Up arrow and Down arrow seem to make the oven beep multiple times but nothing disabled the demo mode. The only way to make that work is when the oven is displaying the time and then pressing and holding either up or down arrow for 3-5 seconds

Is there by any chance someone here that knows how to switch demo mode off or knows a better place to get expert help? I’ve tried Fixya but some dude just sent a link to the manual and marked the question as solved. Nothing in the manual says anything relevant.

fqo0t1,MalzxTheTerrible,How to change default screen orientation?,"I have a Nextbook Flexx 10.1, a cheap tablet/keyboard running Windows 10. It has Intel graphics. 

The problem I'm having with it is that the 0 degree orientation is ""portrait"" instead of the ""landscape"" orientation it would be with the keyboard attached. With the keyboard attached, the screen is rotated 270 degrees. I want that to be the 0 degrees.

Going to ""Advanced Display Settings"" in Windows lists the desktop resolution as 800x1280, where I would expect it to be 1280x800.

I have a strong feeling this is why I cannot get certain things to run fullscreen properly. For example, Rollercoaster Tycoon 1. If I try to run it fullscreen, it only shows a roughly 800x800 square of the screen, and the remainder is either black or my desktop. Cutting off roughly a third of the game's image.

I have tried Nextbook's support, Windows support, and numerous google searches for changing your default orientation. Any mention of similar issues I have seen either go unanswered, or are met with ""go to display properties and select landscape"" or ""use the ctrl+alt+whatever hotkey"". Which is not what I'm looking for.

I have no idea on how to do this or if it is possible at all. I think that I need a network switch to first split the ethernet connection but I don't know how to give Wi-Fi to the other room. If I set up an access point in the first room, the other room will have terrible wi-fi signal, the house is really old and walls are cement filled bricks with iron &amp; steel slag as filler so it disrupts it a lot. Anybody have any idea on how I can achieve this? I thought about setting up a powerline but there is only 1 outlet near the router and a surge-protected  multiplier is plugged in which has TV, NAS Station, PS4, DVR and router power plugged on that so I don't think I can use a powerline adapter with an outlet on it. (the ones that still gives you a power outlet when you plug them in).

fqn9ap,Jam-The-Man,Am I being scammed by my wifi provider?,"So basically I have been experiencing bad wifi for a while now on my computer. Although this, every time I check my speeds on a online tester it tells me that I have got pretty good speeds, like 40 to 50 mbps download and perhaps 15 mbps upload. I thought that this couldn't be right so I decided to see what task manager said about this, and in complete contrast to the online speed testers task manager told me that I had below 1 mpbs for both download and upload. I decided to test this further so I put both the speed tester and task manager on and clicked the test button for the speed test. Out of no where suddenly both the speed tester and task manager where telling me that I had the good wifi that I should be getting according to the speed test. But as soon as the speed test ended the speeds on task manager went back down to below 1 mpbs.

fqn7ne,Saoirse_Says,TV flickering when connected via HDMI,"Hello folks. So uh I've been having a problem lately that I'm not really used to having and could use a bit of troubleshooting help. It's pretty simple... Basically my TV screen flickers either black or with static every once in a while when connected to my laptop via HDMI.  Sometimes there's no flicker, but the sound cuts out.

Here is some information on my whole dealio. My laptop is transmitting a 120Hz 1080p signal to the TV (it supports 120Hz). The TV is a Vizio P55-E1 and the laptop is connected to HDMI 5 (gaming) via a three-way switcher. The flickering happens regardless of which switcher port it's connected to and regardless of whether anything else is connected to the switcher. Other devices have no trouble with the switcher. The problem persists regardless of what cable I'm using.

fqn58o,testingattentionplss,Work landline gets transferred calls from another company on the other end of the state. Cannot figure out how to stop it.,"At my office I have a landline phone with an extension. This is all fine and well, though several times a day I get a call on this phone that is for a doctor's office on the other end of the state. At first I thought I might just have a similar number as them so I looked it up and none of their listed phone numbers are even close to mine.

That made me curious, so then I asked a few questions and learned that these were calls that were being transferred from the receptionist to the doctor, except they would end up on my phone on the other end of the state at a completely unrelated company. I'm not sure how to stop this.

Our phone service is provided by Vonage and they don't know what's going on and they definitely don't care to look into it. I've spoken with the receptionist that these patients are calling in to and she doesn't know anything about it. She said she'd look into it but obviously that hasn't happened or didn't work.

Normally I'd just live with the annoyance because that's who I am, but whenever I answer one of these calls the patient (usually a more elderly person) usually begins with, ""Hey Dr. (Name), this is (Firstname Lastname) and I'm calling to refill my prescription of (Medicine).""

This is not fantastic because A) I don't want to know what kind of medicine they are on, B) This is possibly a HIPAA violation because I know their first and last name, state, and even city so I could probably find them if I wanted to. I don't have any ill intentions, I just want this to stop.

So far only happens in Chrome. We tried with a bunch of other apps and they all went fine. I installed her Firefox for now but she prefers Chrome so she would like to have it fixed if possible. 

Both monitors are plugged in her GPU and the problematic one is using DVI, while the new one is using HDMI. This has never happened when she only had one monitor, so I guess this has to do with the dual-screen setup.

My Samsung Galaxy suddenly stopped recognizing and writing to the inserted microSD card, a SanDisk Extreme Pro 32GB. When plugging the card into the computer, it shows up as a E: drive named SDHC in explorer, but likes to make explorer crash.

If i go to This PC and left click it (just once), it loads forever until explorer stops responding. If i right click it, it crashes too. 

I tried recovery software like EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard. The software recognizes all my drives usually, but as soon as i plug in the SD card it can't load any drives - just like explorer crashes when interacting with the card. The software just keeps trying to identify my drives.

I have non corrupt SD cards still working just fine. I tried on another computer too. Both computers seem to recognize something but explorer crashes in both instances.

I have images on the drive i would prefer to be able to recover....

fqmy7l,ChemicalWeight,Headset/sound problem windows 10,"Hey guys so I have been running into a problem for the last week or so. At first my sound service kept telling me it was off or not working. So I would restart and things would go back to normal for awhile until it happened again. A restart of the service would make it work for a short amount of time and then it would turn off/not work again. So a few days ago I decided it was time to reset my computer to clean it up some and start fresh, also secretly hoped that it would solve this issue. But, sadly it didn't. 

Headset type:

Wired Corsair void pro

Steps I have taken so far:

1. Update drivers
2. Uninstall device and reboot.
3. Changed how windows audio and endpoint services login
4. Installed Corsair ICUE 

Then I found a post suggesting people do this:

1. Uninstall headset from device manager
2. unplug headset
3. restart
4. uninstall ICUE
5. restart
6. Install ICUE
7. plug headset in
8. restart

But that didn't accomplish anything either.

After doing these steps out of no where now the Corsair headset does not show up in Audio inputs and outputs under device manager anymore. It only shows up in Sound, Video and game controllers.

When I have the headset plugged in on boot up of my PC I get the standard 3 beeps inside the headset and it has power as the lights are on.

Can anyone help me figure how to get my computer recognize it as an input/ouput device.",1,1585411598,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqmy7l/headsetsound_problem_windows_10/,techsupport,1
fqmwg3,promisedjoy,Certain PDFs display OK on my computer but come out of the printer completely garbled,"I'm trying to print quite large numbers of PDF attachments to emails. Most of these are scans of documents. Up until now, I've been able to open the attachments in gmail, and print directly from there, without any problem. But today some of the scanned documents are completely garbled when I print them out, although they look fine on the computer screen. There are lots of solid black blocky things appearing, with most of the document being black but a few blocky non-black shapes appearing (kind of like a crossword, or maybe like space-invader sprites - that sort of thing).

This isn't happening with all the attachments, just some of them.

I've found a workaround, but it is really not great. It involves saving the PDF to my computer, then converting the file to TIFF (probably JPG etc would work equally well, I haven't tried that), and then printing the TIFF. The printer then prints out what it should. But this is really painful, and as I said I have a lot of these files to get through every day - and before, when I could print direct from gmail, it was pretty easy to get through them quickly. 

I'm on a Mac (Catalina).

I’ve tried to install the drivers supplied on the AMD website, I’ve installed the Radeon Adrenalin (sp?) detector and installer program and it will detect what drivers I need, “install” them, and I always end up with the error message saying something along the lines of “No AMD drivers are currently installed or the device isn’t functioning properly”, or something like that. When I go into my PC settings, under advanced display settings it says the display driver being used is Microsoft Basic Diplay driver. I’ve looked at forums with other people having this same issue on the same machine. Just need some help please.

fqmdbb,sassyennefer,NVIDIA Driver Code 45,"Hey guys so I have an Acer Nitro 5 (Nitro AN515-51) for about 2 years now. Recently I experienced a blue screen when booting up and afterwards, I realized that all my games had a significant fps drop. I went to the device manager and realized that under display adaptors, my laptop was now running Intel(R) HD Graphics 630 instead of the NVIDIA one, which only appeared when I clicked 'show hidden devices'. Turns out the NVIDIA driver had a Code 45 problem and said that the driver was not connected properly. I tried all kinds of solutions like running the troubleshooter, system file checker, CHKDSK etc. but none worked. 

I finally decided to uninstall the driver as I read online that it would automatically install again if I clicked 'scan for hardware changes'. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. I tried to download manually from the NVIDIA website as well but when I tried to install the driver, it said 'The NVIDIA graphics driver is not compatible with this version of Windows. This graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware.' So now the NVIDIA driver doesn't even appear on the device manager at all. I'm really lost right now so any help would be really appreciated!

Additional info: I used a GeForce GTX 1050 and my OS is Windows 10 64-bit. I didn't uninstall the driver with DDU so maybe that's a problem? I think I may have updated the OS before the blue screen but I'm not too sure on that.

holy shit literally while typing this it happened again. and again, and again

it all seems in relation to a web application they had us use for school called collaborative ultra. all of the text entered relates to questions i posted i think??

it only seems to be from today's session, i have turned my PC on and off at a few hours before this occurred.

virus scans have come up with nothing (avg/malware-bytes)

i keep my computer very secure to the point of paranoia so i am naturally freaking out right now.

my keyboard is a Logitech g915

im on the latest update of windows 10

some process is currently using my mic

It seems to stop if i don't have the Logitech G force Program open

So i recently bought a new ssd wanting to migrate my os system to ssd from my old hdd.

I am thinking to either clone or clean install to my new ssd but there is something i wanted to make sure of.

1. My hdd have two partitions, 1 i installed some educational CAD and FE programs that are quite complicated to install but not impossible, my school onedrive storage, OS system, another one i store some files and games and videos and my personal onedrive storage. If i choose to clone, is it possible to just clone the OS system's partition? After being able to boot from ssd, i can just format and delete the old hdd OS's partition? Will cloning onedrive storage work? Or is it better for me to just uninstall onedrive files and reinstall afterward? Also a question toward onedrive, if i uninstall it will the files that i made keep in my pc stay when i uninstall it , how to i make sure when i delete them , i wont delete them in the cloud school system..cause its not only my file there...
2. So if i do a clean install, will my laptop recognize the windows license that came when i purchased the laptop? So i actually already done some clean install to my pc before, i know my gpu,cpu and moba, thus i know where to download the needed drivers, however for this laptop?, how should i know where to download drivers? Will the windows installs the newest driver automatically when i do the clean install and what about wifi will clean install make my laptop no access to wifi and need to download the wifi driver? and if so , i still have the problem of how to deal with the only partition of os system and installed programs right?...

fqm2o5,Edyrem0,"My internet has been inconsistent and my ISP can't figure out why, any ISP experts out there who might be able to shed a little light?","I'll try to be as descriptive as possible, just lemme know if you need more information. I know there could be a million different little things that could make your internet worse, I'm just hoping my particular issue might be something someone has encountered before.

For at least the last 6 months or so, my download speed has always been fairly consistent at around 500mb/s (which is actually half of what it should be, but I'll get more into that later), while my upload speed remains consistently at 50 mb/s until *exactly* 5 pm, every day, in which it drops down to 3-8 mb/s. It's like a switch gets flipped.

Now, upload speed is rather important to me, because I am attempting to maintain a regular streaming schedule, but it's nearly impossible when my upload speed drops so low. I start dropping over half my frames and the stream is just unwatchable.

So far, I've had a technician come by about 6 times in the last year, and each time, they replaced my modem with a brand new, newer-than-before model (I'm up to a DOCSIS 3.1 capable modem), they've reprovisioned countless times, they've replaced my coax, replaced my Ethernet cord, I've even replaced my entire PC a couple months ago, and the issues persist. Each visit from a tech ends with, ""Well I'll dialogue with my coworkers and see what we can figure out, and we'll get back to you."" and that's the last I hear of it until I call again. Pretty much every piece of wire and hardware has consistently been replaced.

As far as my hardware goes, I do have a gigabit capable integrated NIC, a too-long Ethernet cord that goes directly to the modem, no router, and only two hard connections to the modem, myself and my roommate. We do have multiple devices connected to the wifi, but most aren't in use 90% of the time. Three phones, a PS4, and a laptop.

I pay for gigabit internet, and 50mb/s upload speed, and I only really ever see 500 down max, though the speed tests will start out at 7-800 and drop down by the time it's done. I know I can't expect 1000mb/s down all the time, but half speed seems excessively bad. Oftentimes, speeds will drop down to maybe 100mb/s down and 3mb/s up for the majority of the day. The wifi rarely works in a stable manner despite having a separate 2.4g and 5g network on my modem. 

I do live in a small town of maybe 2000 people, mostly rednecks who don't even know what a keyboard is and old people. The techs that come by have mentioned before that our nodes here in town aren't ever really overloaded, and the hardware at the head-end shows everything operating normally, and that I'm one of maybe 3 people in the area having these types of issues, likely because I doubt anyone else in my area really pays for really high-speed internet.

That's about all I can think of for now, let me know if any more information might be relevant!",0,1585408753,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqm2o5/my_internet_has_been_inconsistent_and_my_isp_cant/,techsupport,1

I did run some software to keep track of the temp of the processor while running a game that caused the restart and it didn't get above 63 degrees celsius so I don't think the issue is with the processor temp.

One other issue could be with the power supply or how I have the GPU plugged in. I have a 6+2 pin cable plugged into the GPU and an adapter so that 6 pins connect into the power supply.

""updated drivers are required. Installed:17.7.1 Required 20.3.1 or newer"" 
It then prompts me to the AMD website to install new drivers. The problem is I have windows 8.1 and according to the website, 17.7.1 is the newest drivers for windows 8.1. 20.3.1 drivers are only available for windows 10 which is not on my PC.

I can ignore this prompt and click ""play"" however the game will not launch if I do that.

Is there any way I can install these drivers on Windows 8.1 or make the game work with older drivers?

fqlf51,coogie,Turning Displayport connected monitor off in 2-monitor setup completely disconnects it,"Current setup: Desktop machine with 2 monitors - one is a 24 inch monitor and the 2nd is an HDTV away from the desk- used to watch something while working and sometimes as a regular 2nd monitor type of thing - dragging a window there just to keep it there. 

The TV is connected with HDMI but I have the option to use DVI or Displayport for my monitor.  If I use DVI for it, if I turn off one monitor, everything that was on that desktop is remembered. If there was a browser window there, it's still there when I turn the monitor back on. If one was a main display and the other was a secondary display, it's still remembered as such.  No issues at all.  

The problem is that I thought I'd go with Displayport for the monitor because it's less bulky and even though I don't need it now, I know Displayport has more bandwidth so eventually I'll have to bite the bullet and connect it now, but what happens is if I turn off one monitor, the computer acts like that monitor was completely disconnected and it throws everything on the 2nd monitor and makes it the main display.  I don't always need both monitors on so I like to keep one off but still have the ""phantom"" desktop where it was.  

Is there any way to make Displayport act the way DVI/HDMI acts? I can go back to DVI for now and it's just an 1920/1200 monitor so it doesn't need Displayport's bandwidth but I remember debating this like 6 years ago and it's weird that there isn't a solution 6 years later.

A few years back my laptop unrecoverably BSOD'd. I had a friend of a friend do data recovery of the HDD for all my music which I didn't have on a backup drive. Problem is, this process created multiple duplicates of every file (up to 4 duplicates). I've already done random testing and some of the duplicates actually are corrupted, or they do play but with lots of artefacts.  
I was thinking of cleaning it out manually, but it's nearly 300GB and 30k+ files, with lots of the metadata lost in recovery, so that was out of the window quickly.

fql9jx,savemystomach,WiFi keeps dropping on and off all day,"I've been dealing with this for months and can't get a straight answer. I've been contacting my ISP and I sent it off to my manufacturer, twice, for 'repair'. They said the laptop was fine and just reinstalled Windows.

The issie is that several times a day my browser will suddenly say 'resolving host' and then 'unable to connect to internet'. The wifi icon will have a warning / no internet sign on it until I either disconnect and reconnect (instantly fixes it) or it fixes itself after a minute or so.

My ISP says nothing is wrong, the repair company said nothing is wrong. But it's been happening every day for months. Reinstalling Windows, updating the BIOS and changing power saver settings, preferred network band etc have not fixed it.

It doesn't happen on ethernet.

I don't really know what else to do, I begrudge paying for a laptop that has such an irritating problem.

I live in a multi-person building with built in wifi so I don't have access to a router and this doesn't happen to anyone else, it also happens wherever I am in the building so it's not a signal issue, it's always at full strength and has fast download speeds when it's not cutting out.

fqku9q,ImNotADickBut,Disable the integrated GPU without deactivating the dedicated gpu,"Hello, I am currently using a Notebook with two gpus, the intel hd 630 and Nividia gt1050 and Windows 10. My integrated gpu is kinda faulty, my computer freezes randomly sometimes and only rebooting saves it. I know its the fault of the integrated gpu because when I deactivate it in the device manager everything works fine and I don't get any crashes. But if the integrated gpu is disabled, my computer still doesnt seem to use the Gt1050. I can't play any games or use apps that are graphically demanding. I set in the Nividia settings that the games and apps should use the GT1050 but it doesnt seem to work. 

So my question is, is there any way I can still deactivate the GPU? Thank you for your help, and sorry if this is not the right place",12,1585404556,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqku9q/disable_the_integrated_gpu_without_deactivating/,techsupport,1
fqku0t,emptysettho,"I suspect someone tried to ""hack"" my router.","Hi everyone. I think somebody is trying to hack my router/computer/wifi connection.

Everything started a few hours ago, when I was creating a Counter Strike server to play with my friends. I turned off my firewall (which is necessary for the server to work), created it succesfully and suddenly my internet connection was off. I found it very strange but I thought it had been just a coincidence. Things got even weirder when, a few minutes later, I was watching TV and a message popped up saying that a ""Samsung J4"" was trying to connect to my Smart TV. I immediately came back to my PC and opened the router settings, I changed the password and deleted a port that I had created to play Counter Strike. Of course, I had also turned on my firewall again previously. Aproximately 5 minutes after I changed the router's password, the internet connection was working again.

I am kind of scared because I have a lot of useful information in my computer. Also I really need everything to work properly, specially during these quarantine times.

fqkstu,mitchensteinn,My computer keeps shutting down while gaming,"Hey there.

As the title says, my computer keeps shutting down while gaming. Sometimes after 10 minutes, other times after a few hours, sometimes even in the menus as well.

I've had this issue for some time now and I've since then changed some parts like the **PSU**, the **CPU Cooler**, the **Video Card** and the **Motherboard**.

And it still shuts down.  

Here are my specs:

**Motherboard:** ASUS H81M-D

**CPU:** Intel i7-4790  3,6GHz  
**CPU Cooler:**  Noctua NH-U9B SE2 

**GPU:** GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 2060 Windforce OC 6GB GDDR6 192 bit

**RAM:** Patriot Signature Line 4GB DDR3, 1600MHz, CL11, 1.5v  - x2  
**PSU:**  nJoy Titan 600, 600W Real Power 

**SSD:** Flash SSD Kingston V300 2.5"", 120GB, SATA 3

Given the fact that the only components that I haven't changed are the **CPU** and **RAM**, (I don't think the SSD could cause system shut down)  maybe one of them is the culprit. Funny thing is that the **temperature of the CPU doesn't really go over 60-70 °C** when it's at 100%. It used to go to 100°C but that's why I swapped the cooler thinking that will solve the issue. Could it be that it suffered some damage with the old cooler and not it's acting up?

If anyone has an ideea, that would be really great.

fqkoj2,Neown,No display after PSU rattling on startup,"Hey guys. 

I recently bought a new board, ram and cpu - msi b450 tomahawk max, a Ryzen 3600 and 2x8gb Corsair Vengeance 3200mhz

Been working perfectly for a few days, then a couple of days ago I went to turn my pc on in the morning and the PSU started making some horrible whining noise, but the PC would still boot and work fine. Turned it off and on a few times but couldn’t stop the noise.

Took the PSU out, gave it a bit of a shake and a spray of compressed air in case anything was stuck in there. Now the noise has gone, but the PC won’t display anything at all. 

I’ve bought a new PSU today and there’s still no display. 

I’ve tried putting my old motherboard back in with my gpu and old ddr3 ram just to check the gpu wasn’t dead (GTX 970) and it displayed fine, so the gpu is good. 

All the fans come on and motherboard lights up, but the gpu fans just move a tiny bit and stop, and continue to do this every few seconds for as long as the PC stays on. Nothing displaying whatsoever.

fqkduy,maruno20,My PC is hard freezing - please help," 

Hey all. I hope you are doing well.

I have a problem with my PC. It's a difficult one and I will try to explain you every step I have taken.

**Operating System** Windows 10 Education 64-bit

**CPU** AMD Ryzen 5 2400GRaven Ridge 14nm Technology

**RAM** 1x8.00GB @ 232MHz (13-13-13-30)

**Motherboard** ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. PRIME A320M-K (AM4)

**Graphics** SAMSUNG (1360x768@60Hz)2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 (NVIDIA)ATI AMD Radeon RX Vega 11 Graphics (ATI)

**Storage** 111GB PNY CS900 120GB SSD (SATA (SSD))930GB HDD

**Audio** Realtek High Definition Audio

**LINK TO SPECCY**: [https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28](https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28)

PC was bought 2 years ago and it already started freezing very rarely from the start.I ignored it and hoped it would stop in the future.

When the problem occurs, computer completely hard freezes. The audio and screen stops. I can't even move the mouse or turn on caps/num/scroll lock on the keyboard.I thought the problem was in my old HDD from 2007. It was the only old component and I bought a new one. The freeze was STILL there after replacement.

I was not playing games in the first 2 years. The freeze happened sometimes when the movie was playing or when randomly browsing internet. Recently, I started gaming and that's when the freezes started occuring more frequently.**They are totally random and it can happen when I start the game or hours and hours in playtime.** I use Discord while gaming if that's important.

Under **Display adapters,** PC says there is an error with my Ryzen 5 Vega integrated graphics not working properly and to check problem **code 43**.  
I don't know if that's causing the problem.

**Things I've tried:**

\- fresh reinstalled Windows

\- installed newest drivers for most of the components

\- disabled integrated GPU in BIOS (there is no way to disable it, I only set my primary display device to Nvidia)

\- using DDU to uninstall all my Nvidia and AMD drivers and then reinstalling ONLY Nvidia driver (newest and older recommended version) - nothing changed and PC still saying theres a problem with my integrated graphics

\- tried changing power from balanced to high performance

\- testing RAM on MemTest86, the test lasted for like 2-3 hours and it said everything is fine

\- CrystalDiskInfo and CrystalDiskMark said my HDD and SSD are healthy

\- scanned for malware

\- System file checker - when I typed sfc /scannow, my computer completely froze 2 times and after **chkdsk** finished, the sfc /scannow completed and said there were no errors

\- tested GPU with FurMark - everything was fine with the temperatures

\- tested CPU with Prime95 - I can't run it for even 15 mins and my CPU temperature quickly rises to more than 85 °C and I shut it down. I disabled AVX.

They can happen while idling or while under heavy load, with no seeming pattern I can put my finger on. Sometimes I get 3 in a row, while I might not get any for a couple of days straight. There are no major changes I have recently made. My temps seem fine (GPU goes up to 65C, CPU goes to about 74C max, idles at 35C).

My main issue is that I don't know how to attack this. Are there some logs or a program that would record some relevant logs for when it happens again that could give me a direction to go in? I'm aware of the ""Event logs"" in windows 10, but I can't find any actionable information there, likely because I don't know how to properly use the feature.

I'm living in the UK and I have an Italian SIM card. My girlfriend and I often call each other to keep in touch. She is leaving in Italy and has an Italian SIM card.

What's happening here is quite interesting:

Every day we call each other and sometimes ( at least 1-2 times per day ) happens that the call suddenly drops, receiver-wise, after 1 minute and 10seconds. 

The caller instead who is still on the call keeps hearing the sounds and hears a repetition of the call from the beginning, initial rings included. The caller then can hear the voice of the receiver.

If the receiver tries to call back the caller, he finds it as busy.

This is happening every day for at least 6-7 months.

However, when we tried the same thing with the motherboard i/o, the same happened. I have verified that both the audio and the microphone works from both my personal computers, and the headset has been used without the extension/splitting cable. Then, the audio worked, but since the jacks are split on the front and rear i/o, the microphone didn't work at all. I have tried updating to the latest version of windows 10, i have updated the audio drivers for the motherboard, i have unplugged and plugged in again the front panel connectors and hd audio, i have checked the bios and it recognized that there was something plugged in.

I was wondering if someone knows how to ""flatten"" all edited fields in a PDF file.  Not sure that ""flatten"" is the right term for it since I don't have layers in my files.  Basically, I have some images placed over parts of pages I need to edit/hide/change and I would like all edited fields to be merged with the pages in such a way that whoever receives the file isn't able to select an image I placed and see what's underneath it.
I'm looking for options other than password protecting the file or placing a digital signature.  And I'm familiar with the ""flatten"" option for form fields and annotations but as I have come to learn, it doesn't apply to added images.

Also, I'm guessing that it would be possible to save all pages as separate images, rasterize them and combine them in a PDF file again, but it seems to me that there must be a much easier and faster way to do it, right?

fqidq1,troubled_water,I have two GPUs but I cannot select between them and other weird stuff is going on.,"I have both a GTX 980 Ti and a Quadro K2000, and I want to play some games on the 980. 

The 980 is always at 0% usage so I try to use the windows 10 display settings to run some games using exclusively the 980, but it has the K2000 as all of the GPU options ('high performance' and 'power saving'). So now things get weird because I try to use the Nvidia control panel to reassign the GPUs but [it can't seem to identify the 980 \(which would give another drop-down menu to reassign things on this page\)](https://i.imgur.com/6c07B62.png) despite [it being shown when selecting GPUs for the PhysX settings](https://i.imgur.com/rPudCuM.png). Selecting the 980 for PhysX still has the 980 at 0% usage.

Things are also strange because I can't boot the PC at all using the 980, but if I boot it with the K2000 and then change the ports to the 980, it works, however after an hour or two the computer crashed. 

I tried plugging them both into the same monitor and dupliating the screen which only made things slower yet the 980 stayed at 0%. I looked into it overheating but the 980 seemed fine (by the time I checked it, it was down to 60). 

What is going on? Is the 980 broken? Do I know nothing about computers?",9,1585394627,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqidq1/i_have_two_gpus_but_i_cannot_select_between_them/,techsupport,1

fqi5m3,Alien_Cha1r,"Monitor does not work via DisplayPort, only through HDMI","Basically my monitor (Acer XV272U) which is a 1440p 144hz freesync monitor, won't work properly over displayport, however hdmi works fine (but cannot use freesync).

I have a GTX 1070 and use 2 other monitors as well, both connected flawlessly via displayport.

The weird thing about this problem monitor is that it used to work (better). Displayport used to run flawlessly as long as I turned off freesync which would cause it to lose connection sometimes when gaming for around 3 seconds., but using it non-gaming worked just fine.

Now however, the monitor displays only a washed out image (its static and does not move/reflect whats actually happening). When I boot windows with the monitor over displayport it wont start as the screens all stay black. Again, no problems over hdmi.

Ultimately, I need to get displayport working as I want to use freesync.

I already did both a clean uninstall and reinstall of my nvidia drivers in windows safe mode. I swapped all of my 3 different displayport cables around the monitor and gpu ports, all of them produce the same result with the problem monitor. So the cables are definitely fine.

I also reset all the settings on my monitor after playing around with them but it also yielded no results. I also changed some stuff in the nvidia control panel, like refresh rate etc.

I have also read a psu might cause something like that, mine has only 400w but didnt have any problems before (at least not that I know of).",0,1585393634,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqi5m3/monitor_does_not_work_via_displayport_only/,techsupport,1

This only affects this one machine, we have 3 other laptops that do not have this problem and a linux desktop also not affected.  And all phones, TV and consoles also do not have this problem with connecting.

So I work In IT but this issue is getting on my nerves and I need a second opinion on what to do next.




At my girlfriends place we are streaming quite a lot. She lives in some student housing area where they share an Internet connection. As far as I know they main fiber line to the central is a 10.000/10.000 or so connection and it is then split out between these smaller areas so about 8 apartments share a 100/100 line. Running Nat type 3.



I am on my desktop running a cabled connection and speed tests are fine. Streaming there is no issue either.


However my girlfriend has issues when streaming on her laptop, phone and especially smart TV over WiFi.

The smart TV makes sense. Speed test shows 6.6 Mbps down. This device is by far the worst.


Her laptop and phone gets 60Mbps+ but they are still freezing and buffering when using streaming services and I have no idea why.


Obvious next step is to connect a cable and see if the issue persists, but how could I make the WiFi work as it should?

TV is a Samsung series 6 running newest update. 
IPhone is IPhone X and the laptop is an older HP running win 10 1909. All fully updated.

fqhsfc,DoggOwO,Programs shutting down without producing error messages,"So over the last 2 days I've been running into a bunch of trouble with my pc. It sratred with the problems I outlined [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/fqg6id/using_a_graphical_gui_editor_such_as_scene/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) but the gist of it is the following: For university, I'm working on Java apps with a graphical user interface. Programming the positioning, dimensions, etc. of the individual graphical elements produces no problems but when I try and use an editor like Scene Builder, the development environment unexplicably shuts down.

I finally got a workaround where I just use drag and drop the individual fxml files into Scene Editor but the problem still persists, hindering my workflow and rendering the IDE I so far grew accustomed to, Eclipse, useless.

Now I stumbled into another problem with another software. A project management software called V-Modell XT is required for one of my courses. So I installed it but when I launch the project assistant, it immediately closes the application again as if I just hit Alt + F4. There are no error messages whatsoever whenever this happens.

Just a week ago, there was a major problem for almost all my fellow students in one of our course where we couldn't use the phone emulator for Android Studio because we had to install HAXM and after fiddling around for 1,5 h I fixed it for me by enabling Hyper-V in my Windows settings, restarting my pc, disabling Hyper-V and restarting again. It just fixed itself.

Additionally, when I first got my current pc running about 6 months ago, it constantly got fatal errors like kernel\_heap\_corruption and some others that I can't remember right now but they all went away on their own after a few days and haven't appeared since.

This machine is cursed if you ask me. My only request is that maybe you can tell me what's wrong or what could be the cause of this mess of issues because googling hasn't helped much and I seem to be the only one around me that has this many issues with his pc. Here are my specs if it helps:

Now said drives will crash and **disconnect** from my pc. I'll open up device manager and the drive will not be there. The drive does not reappear until I unplug the SATA power cable from it, then plug it back in.

Here is the interesting thing. In my attempts to fix it, I replaced the SATA power cable, hooked everything up, clicked power and nothing turned on except the CPU lights. Put back in the old SATA power cable, everything works fine.

My next thought was that perhaps the sector on my Power Supply was busted, I'll try one of the other SATA ports. This also did not work with the new SATA power cable.

The only things I can think of it being is that **multiple** hard drives are dying at the same time, coincidentally. Or that my Power Supply is dying.

One of them kind of did the work. and removed some of the unnecessary Bit defender files, but that software is still there, and it doesn't have an uninstaller. It won't even let you click on any of its menu options unless you pay for the full software. I even tried to delete the whole folder directly from the Local Disk 'C', but it won't let me. The message says, ""You require permission from the administrator to make changes to this folder."" It also has its own tasks going on in the background. I called up the task manager and tried to end those tasks, but they won't end. The software has been annoying me with the message, ""Please update your product to stay protected."", for a year.  And it's pop-ups about the activation keep coming up every single time.

fqh9fb,CNL__,Rx 570 installation issue,"Hello guys and girls.
I have an ASUS rx 570 Expedition, just bought from Amazon Warehouse, for very cheap, classed as 'used'.

Long story short after much experimentation, I put it in, and it didn't show anything. I have seen a few people post about BIOS/Legacy/UEFI, so I went down that avenue eventually.

If I leave this option at its previous value of choosing Legacy BIOS as the first option, my PC boots, with no output to the monitor and no activity on the card itself. The card gets gradually hot, but the fans are off, they spin for 5 seconds then they stop so I feel like the card is asleep. However, I know the PC actually boots, as it beeps on startup, then I hear the Windows jingle through my speakers afterwards.

If I put the UEFI Bios priority option, then my PC does not boot. There is no beep, and there is no Windows jingle. However, the card fans are running the entire time! I don't know if that is better or worse in this case.

My current PC is P8p67LE (yep, old), i5 3400, 12gb ddr3 ram, and up til now have used the r9 270X from Sapphire, with no issues, for about 5 years. Corsair 430W PSU.

I believe I have the newest BIOS version. I have cleared the BIOS and the results are the same with legacy/uefi.

If I absolutely have to, I will upgrade my motherboard and CPU, I just had no intention to spend that extra money what with the coronavirus shutdown and all.

This problem occurs just about with every socket in my house. I'm sure this is a hardware problem.

It has been this way for about 3 days. All I remember, (before this problem occurred) is that I installed a setup file / media creation tool to upgrade to Windows 10. But I didn't run the setup because the charger was already starting to be defective, started blinking and wouldn't charge the laptop. So, I decided to just shut down the laptop since the installation wouldn't really work properly. 

Just to let you know, my laptop only starts up and runs property if a charger is plugged into it. 

To add further information, my dad used to remove the laptop's battery and plug in the charger causing what he calls, ""infinite battery life."" He would use this technique every time he would use it. We share this laptop as a whole family by the way. We've been using it for a whole 7 years now.

The problem is that the charger has a LED on the front of the power brick. Usually if it's plugged in, it would just stay green and wouldn't blink like how it is now. It would blink every two seconds.

I haven't had the chance to look up my laptop's specs and judging by the situation I'm currently in, I'm never gonna know. My laptop runs Windows 8. But I remember that it runs an Intel Core i5 if that's gonna help. My laptop is a Samsung Notebook NP350V5C-A02AE. Perhaps you guys could just search up the model's specs. I haven't installed any hardware ever since I've been using it. But it seems the problem here is the charger, not the laptop.

The charger that I'm using is an AC adapter made by a company named Delta Electronics, Inc. 

I have no further information on the charger itself, to be honest.

I've tried plugging the charger in every socket in my house. I haven't tried disassembling it or fixing the hardware since I'm no expert in that type of field. Yet, the charger's cable is intact and not broken.

Due to the long use of the charger, it may just have gave up and became defective. The laptop's battery might've also been defective. I'm planning to buy a new one but I'm just looking if this could be fixed.

fqgs0g,superthrust,Got a weird issue involving Voicemeeter Banana &amp; Elgato Streamdeck,"So, the Elgato Streamdeck has a built in feature that allows me to use it as a soundboard.

I can take audio clips, load them to buttons and decide what channel I want to output it to.

&amp;#x200B;

I use Voicemeeter to combine the soundboard audio and my mic audio. Thats it. 

This is how I am able to play my sound clips via my mic channel in discord and in games. I have yet to figure out any other way as it seems Elgato (now taken over by Corsair) are VERY inept with the management of their software.

&amp;#x200B;

Without Voicemeeter, I am not able to pair audio together and play sounds on discord or in game.

&amp;#x200B;

LATELY, however, I have used any sound effect, and this causes my entire windows audio/voicemeeter/etc. to glitch. It emits a grindy error noise and cuts out the audio ever 5-10-15 seconds. Visibly, in the voicemeeter app, i can see my levels freeze, as in, the whole application freezes for about 3 seconds, then resumes normal audio playback.

&amp;#x200B;

I have attempted to restart the windows audio service, nothing. I've reinstalled both elgato and voicemeeter, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

This didnt used to do this at all, but i feel like it might be an update with elgato, but im trying to see if there are any alternatives or something I can use to fix this? Possibly a way I can route my sound clip playback automatically through a channel i choose? (Windows has this built in, but when i do that, nothing happens. Either no sound is played at all, or it simply freezes as if there is no audio output source.)

&amp;#x200B;

I understand this may all be VERY confusing for someone trying to help and ill do anything i can to help explain it anymore if youre confused. I am just getting sick of playing a single sound byte mid stream then having to reboot because of the stupid audio cutting in and out, making games and any audio playback impossible.",3,1585387103,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqgs0g/got_a_weird_issue_involving_voicemeeter_banana/,techsupport,1

fqgnai,WillTakePantsOff,Installing drivers from a separate computer.,"Hi all,

So we had these self serve kiosks at work that were running on these Optiplex 9010 mini towers. The kiosks were being thrown out so - with permission - I took one of the PC’s home to try and convert from a POS to a basic little home computer while I’m stuck at home as I only have a barely useable laptop and am not really in any position right now to buy a new machine.

It was running Windows 7 Pro but was locked out of the administrator account so I managed to install Windows 7 Home from a USB flash drive. The only reason I’ve kept to 7 so far is that it showed the (NX) problem when I tried to upgrade to 10. The main problems I’m having are that it’s not recognising the keyboard and it also cannot detect any networking hardware. I thought if I went to a new version of 7, I could get online and install the keyboard drivers to get into the BIOS settings to enable NX but obviously I now have another hurdle. It sometimes picks up the keyboard when you first boot but then it drops back to an unknown device and I know there is networking hardware because it worked before I changed the OS, which I THINK means these are driver related issues?

My question is can I find the drivers on my shitty old laptop and install them to the desktop by USB drive? And how can I find out exactly which drivers I need? Or am I completely off the mark on what the problem actually is?

Probably a pretty dumb question but if I had any hair I’d have ripped it out already over this.",1,1585386396,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqgnai/installing_drivers_from_a_separate_computer/,techsupport,1

fqgiqh,MagicalBBA,My PC hard freezes intermittently.,"First off, these are the thing's I've done to fix it:

Stress testing GPU, CPU and memory(GPU did not pass the test, but I'll talk about it later)

Updating BIOS(Not the recent one, because my CPU works best at an older version)

Reapplying thermal grease to both GPU and CPU

Replacing a graphic card(970 to rx5700xt)

Formatting both HDDs

And today, I've replaced power supply unit(600W to 700W) but it's still happening.

&amp;#x200B;

First, it happened not too often. So I just ignored it. But it started to annoy me, so I decided to do some stress test on some of the parts.

CPU was fine, passed 6 hours of Prime32, memory was fine as well.

The first suspect was the graphic card. GTX970, bought about 3 years ago, didn't pass the Furmark test. It always froze when GPU temp hits about 75℃, so I've ditched it and replaced it with a brand-new Radeon rx5700-xt. It seemed like it's been fixed at first, survived about 2 hours of Furmark. But it was not. It froze when SHUTTING DOWN Furmark. So GPU wasn't the culprit, unless I've picked up another faulty graphic card, which is highly unlikely.

So the second suspect was the PSU. FSP, 600W, used almost 10 years, not well-ventilated, dusty as hell. Bought a new one(FSP, 700W) and tried it. At first, again, it looked like it's gotten better. Shutting down Furmark after running it for 30 minutes or so didn't do any harm anymore. But when I shut down Apex Legends, it happened again.

At this point, I think it's the motherboard, but who knows.

It happens seemingly randomly, but as you can see, it happens way often when I shutdown a heavy-loading application(video games, Furmark, etc.) Not never, but given that it doesn't freeze too often when I'm playing, my guess is that something's having trouble with going to idle from full-load.

I am probably going to buy a new motherboard tomorrow no matter what, but if someone had a similar problem and know how to fix it without replacing the motherboard, please do bestow your brilliance upon me.

Probably the dumbest thing I have ever done was that. I should have installed only m2 ssd first, install windows to that and then put the 1 tb hdd. Instead, I got confused at bios because the names made no sense and installed windows (which means formatted) on the 1 tb hdd.

I really need to recover my files from that hdd. With m2 ssd I also bought a normal portable hdd yesterday so I can move recoved files to that immediately.

fqggoq,BerdyGaming,PC randomly crashes,"Hi,
I recently got a new pc with the [following parts](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XvKkb8) and I randomly endure crashes. 

Basically, my PC would randomly cut all audio in my headphones, the monitor would freeze for seconds and then my monitor will say that it has no signal. The event viewer shows no errors except the error of the PC not shutting off properly when i boot it up since to get it off the frozen state, I need to use the power button. I really can't understand why its happening. I'm running brand new parts and the most recent drivers. 

More info about the crashes, they almost never happen under load. They usually happen when I'm doing casual browsing with the only thing opened at the moment being Firefox, Discord and Spotify, sometimes even Steam but I don't have anything running there at the time. Today it happened while I was rendering something in Blender but I honestly think it was mostly random.

GPU: Evga 980 ti SC+(I bought it second hand from a friend)

SSD: m.2 Samsung 860 evo 500 GB

Case: NZXT H500

OS: Windows 10 Pro

My problem is that my pc shutdown to black screen with no error screen or something else and I only could start the pc again after pulling the plug for one min. This recently started about a month ago. At first the shutdown occured every time I started a high demanding game like Call of Duty Modern Warfare. I got into the main menu and when I start a game my pc would shutdown.

I tried to troubleshoot the problem after that. I did this with OCCT tests. The CPU test ran fine but the GPU and Power test would cause my pc to shutdown after clicking start. After that I looked at the temperatures and I saw that my GPU was idling at 60 degrees celcius. So I downloaded Precision X from the Evga website and I put the fan control in agressive. With the new fan control settings I ran OCCT tests again and it seemed to solve my problem. But the last 2 days I had my system shutdown again to black screen. It happened yesterday night and I pulled the plug and went to sleep. When I started my pc again this morning I got a screen with an error message: ""System power fault triggered due to opwer surge detected during previous boot up to protect system from unstable power supply.""

I'm somewhat inexperienced with PC hardware. I know my way around PCs fairly ok (software wise) but have no experience with hardware. I configured a PC online off of recommendations and had it assembled by the online shop where I ordered it at. 

However, the PC is very loud. It's louder than my 5 year old PS4 and this shouldn't be a thing, right?

Here is my question: What could be the source of the problem or how could I start figuring this out? I googled this a lot but can't really find the problem.

I went into the BIOS and saw the following fan controls:

70°C - 100%

65°C - 75%

20°C - 20%

0°C - 20 %

My PC is currently just web browsing and around 37 decibel loud. Sounds way too much for basic browsing, correct?

fqfime,TheFlakyBiscuit15,Computer restart on launch attempt of some games,"Hey there, new to reddit, but I'm trying to find a fix any way I can. 

When I attempt to launch some games (ex: Portal 2, Sekiro(new issue), Divinity 2, Warcraft III, etc.) my computer will instantly cut to black and restart after a minute or two. These games (besides Sekiro) have never launched before, and are often fresh installs, and do not launch successfully before the screen cuts out, as the files are missing specific folders that are added on the first successful launch. I've been trying to figure out for a few months what the cause of this is. In the specific case of Sekiro, I played it plenty with no issues about a year ago, and I stopped until a few days ago, when it suddenly cut to black and restarted my computer. I haven't changed any hardware or touched the files since i played it a year ago, so this instance made me very concerned. This problem also seems to be happening more often (only with new installs, so far Sekiro is the only exception). Could it be an issue with a piece of hardware failing, such as my motherboard dying or a sudden voltage increase to my PSU? If there's a way I can fix this, I would be extremely grateful for the help.

PS: The cut to black and following restart does not happen randomly, nor does it happen with other basic programs. This ONLY happens when I attempt to launch some games (even very old ones).",4,1585380179,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqfime/computer_restart_on_launch_attempt_of_some_games/,techsupport,1

fqekpx,KylAnde01,I actually get higher fps using windows borderless in MW: Warzone... cons?," quick PC tech question.

When  I run in full screen borderless mode my fps takes a 10\~15fps boost.  Stable too. I discovered this when the game settings changed themselves  automatically. I had sudden fps boost in a game and checked the options  to see what happened. It switched to fullscreen borderless at max  resolution and rendered down slightly. I didnt notice much in the change  of quality except that my fps was a steady 60\~75 at all times.

Everything  I've read said that fullscreen borderless should slow down and limit  your fps big time by running through the desktop, why am I the opposite?  Are their any other cons to running this display? Maybe some input  delay from the mouse/keyboard to the game from running through the  desktop? I've tried finding more info on this little phenomenon but  haven't had any luck.

I installed a new graphics card first and everything was fine with my audio for a few days. Then my motherboard and processor came in. After installing them an old problem that I had before with my Razer Kraken Pro V2 (not USB, it's the 3.5 mm stereo/audio split cable) resurfaced, all my game audio, music or YouTube video audio now plays through my microphone/headset and all my friends can hear it clearly in Discord. I checked if it was just Discord by recording myself, it was there as well. I've tried different headsets to no avail (Man O' War's and an old junky headset I had lying around). 

  
My PC Spec's are as follows:

\- Nvidia Geforce RTX 2060

\- ASUS Tuf Gaming X570-plus (motherboard)

\- AMD Ryzen 7 3700x

The problem didn't arise until after I installed the processor and motherboard. I installed the proper drivers for the motherboard and graphics card, I tried updating the Realtek Audio Drivers I have.. I tried rolling back the drivers, I tried everything I could find online. Long ago there was an enhancements tab in the sound control panel for my recording/playback devices but that's nowhere to be found after some windows update. My last ditch effort was just completely factory resetting my computer like I should have after making big hardware changes. I literally have nothing installed other than the drivers that came with the motherboard and my updated graphics drivers and I still have the problem.

fqdv78,kostatheprototype,PC won't boot up and USB Disk won't mount,"I use Windows 10 (Distro Pro [i think]), as I boot my PC up everything looks normal untill I input my password and press enter to log in. The little loading sprite shows up and freezes after a few seconds.

Aparently it had already opened to my desktop but it didn't show it up on screen, it still showed the frozen login loading screen. So I had to ctrl+alt+del &gt; task manager for my pc to even show me the desktop. 

And then lo and behold parts of the UI are gone. The task bar has no border and color it's just transparent and unresponsive. The icons are unresponsive. Everything is barely somewhat responsive on clicks. I tried shutting the pc down by opening start and clicking on shut down but that wouldn't register either. 

I decided to do a factory reset on the C partition. 
Because I could get to the login screen which was fully responsive untill I tried logging in, I did shift+restart to open up the recovery screen. I did a reset only on the drive where windows was installed [ /C: ].

After a while the reset was successful and I tried booting it froze up on loading and started recovering back to the previous state before the reset. I didn't even know windows had that option.

So I decided to do a full reset on the [/C:] drive by erasing everything and cleaning the partition. Which means it had to open up. But after like half an hour later after its finished I tried booting it up and all it did was shoe the windows loading screen, then start just blinking. As if disconnecting and then connecting the cable from the monitor to the PC. It just turned the screen on and off. I left it like this for hours and nothing happened.

I booted the PC up with Kali Linux from a USB to try and recover everything from my [/D:] partition. I mounted the partition and mounted a external USB Drive. Everything worked as intented and I started transfering everything I had on my [/D:] partition. After transfering like 35% of everything it freezed up. Like the UI freezed up too, it was unresponsive to everything.

I left it like that for an hour just to make sure. But nothing changed, still unresponsive. So I did the horrible sin of disconnecting the USB Drive while it was transfering, which I'm not even sure it was still transfering but I had no other option. Screen still showed the same thing as before. So I force shut down the PC by the button.

Next time i tried booting up Kali the starting UI was different, like it went down a version. The UI where u choose wether u want percistence or a live boot or a forensics boot etc etc. It looked different and older, less polished. But it still worked fine. I boot up kali and mounted the [/D:] partition which worked. I then tried mounting the external USB Disk, but it didn't wanna mount and threw this error at me (Unknown Erorr (udisks-error-quark 0)).

I even tried booting up Kali from another USB that had the exact same version as the one that got fucked up and went down a version somehow. But it still showed a older boot up menu. 

I tried connecting the External USB Disk to another PC to make sure I didn't fucking corrupt it like the stupid retard I am but it worked just fine, I even did a few tests to make sure it's working right and sure enough its okay. 

I'm now stuck with my data in the hard drive, still intact. But windows just doesn't wanna boot, every time I try it just blinks as if disconnecting the screen and connecting it again. 

Even if I did recover all my data by connecting the hard drive itself to another PC and recovering all the data, I still wouldn't be able to do anything with my PC since windows wont even get to the login screen. I can still use the hotkeys at the beggining and get into the BIOS menu and all the other options, but I have no clue how I can recover from this situation from there.

Thanks for even reading all those chunks of text, I can't write that well so sorry for the pain my writing caused you dear friend.

I'm having this weird setup with my PC and somehow I'm not sure what could be the issue here or not, so let me try to explain a bit and maybe someone run into the same issue that I did.

My PC is not the newest (CPU i5-3570k, MB: Gigabyte Z77X-D3H, 16GB DDR3, SSD 120GB from Intel, couple of HDD's, GTX 1050ti) running Windows 10 Pro (version 1909, OS build 18363.72 with update KB4541335) but recently I've spotted weird issues that when I open any audio/video file, my mouse stops reacting and you can't use it. It's not like USB is disabled (as  usb-selective-suspend  is disabled) but the moment I go to youtube, play some music locally via Winamp (I know, I'm that old :) ) or play a movie, mouse stops reacting The moment I close the page like youtube or FB, or close audio/video, it's ok again. I have a mouse from Steelseries Rival 600 so as it has RGB, I can see that colours are on but the mouse is not reacting. Truth be told, sometimes it happened that the mouse and only mouse connected via USB to MB stopped completely as RGB went off. What is strange, other components like USB keyboard was still working fine, only mouse had issues. 

I recently bought new wireless headset (Steelseries Arctis 7 2019 edition) and when I connected it into PC, these issues sort-of occurred where this weird setup is happening.  When I browse sites, news where there's no audio/video files, it's ok. Initially I thought it could be due to web browser and as by using Opera, Firefox &amp; Chrome (latest updates always) and it's happening in all 3, I've skipped this part. 

All drivers to mice, keyboard, audio ... are up to date and for normal work at the moment, it seems to be ok, but as long as I play now song/video, try to watch youtube, FB... my mouse is not reacting. 

I kinda checked the setup in drivers, devices connected, disabled in audio enhancements, restarted PC several times, but it's happening again and again and I might be suspicious, but somehow I have a feeling that it points me to new wireless headset where transmitter is connected to USB if this could be the reason. But strange thing is, that other 6 USB devices before I connected it were ok.

Somehow I was already thinking that I would reinstall Windows but I have ton's of apps already installed there and I'm trying to avoid this at the moment, so any ideas or thoughts are appreciated.

Today I hear they released a HotFix 444.78 so I updated. All was fine but I had the same lighting glitches that I had in 444.75 in Monster hunter. So I go back to the previous driver before 444.75. using ddu.

After doing this my PC started to run insanely slow, windows was fine, still at 144hz but any applications that had anything to do with graphics caused the computer to go at a snails pace.

So I figure I should do a full uninstall of the driver then reinstall but now the computer won't boot. I think it's because I have wallpaper engine to automatically load.

Anyone have suggestions? I was thinking of unplugging my D drive where wallpaper engine is installed and just leaving the C drive in.

fqctpg,awfeel,Im at the end of my rope here,"First some background, built a computer around 6-7 months ago and it was having blue screen errors randomly, sometimes wouldnt happen for days then happen back to back to back to back. Dealt with trying to figure it out myself for like 2-3 weeks before i finally broke down and brought it to Geek Squad. Theyve replaced my mobo for a more expensive one now and I've had it there 3 times. Needless to say, that didn't solve my problem, and in some ways that computer started to feel worse to a point of not starting after I tried to figure the problem out again.  


Okay so fuck that computer, Ill just literally build a new one with tax money. I was about to rip my hair out as it was. Order all new parts. Everything I needed except for a dvd drive which i just used to install windows NBD. Once installed took that out and closed the case. New compute was running fantastic for a few hours once I got it running (few issues in the begining to include psu randomly turning on/off like a revving engine until it started the one time) -- I was thinking loose wire - right? So I reseated everything and pushed all the wires in best I could. Paid extra attn to the PSU wires and the mobo wire was like 96% plugged in. Easy Fix.  


Except now the NEW computer is also blue screening occasionally. Memdiag comes back clean and SFC finds no errors. Im at the end of my rope here and Im really losing it.

I can interact normally with the Internal Storage and when I put the micro SD card in a card adapter and plug it on my PC, everything works fine. 

I'm using and original USB cable, my micro SD card is legitimate (confirmed it on SanDisk's website) and there aren't any other issues. Also, I have root access.

fqcmrc,UziShoulders,Newly built PC gives my mic static.,"Title. I just built a PC like last week and ever since then I’ve been trying to figure out why my mic has a static sound. Here’s the noise I’m talking about: https://youtu.be/d2SrlVWTZ_A

It’s so annoying. I have to use noise suppression to make it tolerable but it also makes my mic sound bad and quieter. I’ve tried 2 headsets and they both have static. I plug my headset directly into my MSI B450 Tomahawk MAX motherboard with a splitter by the way. I’ve tried reinstalling audio drivers, using the front audio/mic combo jack, turned off mic boost, and I’ve tried plugging my PC straight into a grounded outlet to see if it was an electrical problem. I still hear static. Even tested my headset on another PC and there wasn’t static. I’ve noticed that when I was testing my mic in discord, discord still registered the static even when I had just the splitter plugged in with no mic. I’m guessing a part in my PC isn’t grounded properly but I don’t know what it can possibly be. I’m honestly out of ideas and I’m losing my mind here. Can anyone help me with this?

And actually, on average 1 per 20 startups this isnt a thing and the fan doesnt scream, but makes little noises like you would imagine hitting your desk very slowly with a pen and an unborn lion very quietly and indistincly roaring in the background.
Is there any way to fix this, or shut off the fan without actually digging into the case with screwdrivers? I tried to put it on 0% speed in open hardware monitor but it doesnt seem to be a solution, either it doesnt work or the fan is not seen by OHM at all. the case is Zalman Z3

fqc2ep,EllisTheExile,Random BSOD's with different error codes each time Windows 10,"Hi there this has me a bit stumped and to be honest a little afraid to use my computer. So recently my computer has been pretty healthy until 2 days ago when I got my first blue screen of death. I had Twitch on one monitor, playing Black Mesa on the other while listening to Spotify.  SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION was the stop code for the first one. I left my computer on overnight to run various scans and came to find it rebooted in the morning, I can only assume it BSOD'd again. After that I got various different blue screens either SYSTEM\_SERVICE\_EXCEPTION or I would get CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED usually I was doing multiple processes at the time.   


My Windows 10 installation is on an M2 275 GB SSD and I wasn't sure if it was the SSD or Windows itself because I kept getting errors coming up while using several different commands in cmd prompt, so I made back ups of important files and then I reformatted my SSD after which I installed Windows 10 on it. I finished that at roughly at 7 pm. Everything worked fine that night and into tomorrow where I played Control all day. At around almost 24 hours exactly I had another blue screen, but I was just watching youtube at that point. I had a couple more last night, with one new error message MEMORY MANAGEMENT.  Today I've had one CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED but I've had two straight up black screen crashes, with the latest one disappearing both my desktop background &amp; task bar while playing my audio in slow motion and then black screen crashing. I tried running the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool but after it finished I didn't get any results posted there or in Windows, so I'm a bit stumped as to what could be the problem and if it's hardware I don't mind replacing it but I don't want to spend money I don't need to spend without being 100% sure of the problem.  Thank you in advance Reddit.

fqc1kw,coogie,"Monitor: ""DVI no signal"" magically starts working after using HDMI port and switching back","Just trying to understand what might have happened and whether the monitor is on the way out - though I just checked and it's almost 7 years since I bought it so it's had a good run!  Anyway, this is an  ASUS ProArt PA248Q monitor that has a Display Port, HDMI, HDMI, and VGA port...beautiful monitor that I love, but I digress.

Out of the blue when I turned the computer on, I saw the screen was blank even though everything looked on and the monitor would say ""DVI NO SIGNAL"" when I'd push the input selector.  I thought maybe it was my video card since the last time I had this issue, it was the video card so I switched over to the onboard graphics and still nothing. I had another monitor so I tried that and it was working so the computer was ruled out as was the cord but I tried my laptop with an HDMI-DVI cable and the monitor was still not working.  

I have pretty much every cable combination in my cable drawer so I decided to just go straight HDMI to HDMI and voila! the monitor was working.  I thought perhaps the DVI port was bad but just for fun I selected DVI again and put the old cables back and voila! it magically started working again.  

I actually found a DisplayPort cable in my drawer and just switched to that but it was just weird how the DVI port would stop working and nothing would bring it back, even removing the power cable but then it'd start working again like nothing happened...",0,1585364501,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqc1kw/monitor_dvi_no_signal_magically_starts_working/,techsupport,1

For a few months now, me and one specific other friend cannot join each other in literally any game. It started when Halo came out on PC, and we tried to join each other and couldn't, and just chalked it up to a new platform release being buggy. Then later on we tried playing on a Minecraft server and that didn't work, and a few weeks ago we tried playing Black-Ops zombies together and that didn't work either. We can play together if there's other of our friends there though, and it's not just the two of us. Today it came to a head when we could not join each other's GTA lobby. All five of our friends were in but we could not be in the same lobby at the same time, not even a private mission (one of us would keep getting kicked).

I know this sounds crazy but is there some kind of port forward issue where we blocked each other's routers or something? Is that even a thing? Every game has given some tech error.

&amp;#x200B;

Computer would freeze sometimes, usually during heavy usage (game and watching twitch), but would usually be good after I opened it up to give it a good cleaning. So this happens again, and I also decide to check the connections on everything (computer would also freeze if I accidentally bumped the case sometimes). 

Now it will not reboot, but beep four times and have error code '55' on the motherboard's display. Googling that led me to a RAM issue and my friend who had a similar build with similar issues in the past had replaced his RAM with some success. Anyway, I replaced the 8GB RAM with the 16GB  listed in the build but am still getting the beeps and '55.' Swapping in the old ram one at a time and each slot will sometimes get a code of '10' with no beeps, but does nothing else after turning on.

Parts list is best I could find going through Order Histories. Not 100% on the processor since I got it in person from Micro Center

fqbeyy,lauramaetc,Boyfriend’s ps4 not working,"
Hi friends,
I’m trying to cheer up my gamer boyfriend by attempting to fix his ps4. The last week it’s been acting strange, not entering rest mode correctly, and then shut off incorrectly by itself one day. So we knew it was acting strange but then when we restarted it, it would work normally, NBA 2K all day. Today he put it in rest mode and we watched a movie, then during the movie (ugh) noticed it wasn’t in rest mode cause the lights were different than normal I guess. He tries to turn it on and black screen won’t do anything so he unplugs it. What else can you do ya know. 

Well everyone knows it’s bad news bears when you hard shut down. It does the whole loading screen because it’s angry and then the ps4 logo pops up, everything looks good, fans running, blue light is flashing, and then black screen and then black ps4. We tried this multiple times, I tried blowing away the dust (I can’t get into the ps4 cause I don’t have that special screwdriver but the guy has never cleaned it before in his life), and replugged it in and same result.  Can anyone help us?? Any suggestions?",4,1585362035,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fqbeyy/boyfriends_ps4_not_working/,techsupport,1

I know nothing about pc gaming but i wanted to try to play tekken 7 on my laptop. I dont mind sacrificing some graphical quality. However stable 59-60 fps is a must. So i have been trying to run it and i get 60fps for a few minutes then suddenly it drops to 30-40. Then after approx 10 minutes it goes back up to 60 and it repeats the cycle. Lowering the graphics further makes it unplayable. 

When looking at task manager, i see gpu utilization keeps jumping from 100% to 50% and cpu on lei goes as high as 20%. 

Someone told me to go to userbenchmark and so i did and i got cpu 45% and gpu 15%.

fqar9v,OtakuJoness,NVMe SSD not showing up ANYWHERE,"NVMe SSD not showing up ANYWHERE

I've had a 1 TB Intel 660P for a little while now. It worked fine up until this morning. When I started my PC, I got error 0x000000e, which is apparently either a disk failure or it can't get to certain boot files (in my case winload.efi). I couldn't get to advanced startup options or anything. The BIOS didn't even detect it. I reinstalled Windows and chose Disk 0, because that's what my NVMe was. Turns out it was my little SATA SSD that I kept videos and stuff on.

Now my NVMe won't show up in the BIOS, Disk Management, diskpart/list disk, or device management. This SSD has all my data on it and I would prefer not to lose any of it. Please help.

SPECS:

CPU: Ryzen 5 2600X

Motherboard: MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC (yes, it has the latest BIOS on it)

GPU: AORUS 2080 Super

RAM: G.SKILL Trident Z Neo 16 GB DDR4-3600 CL16 (at 3466 because B450 board)

I've also reseated everything (CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD). After reseating everything it all just worked and I could boot from my NVMe again and see it in the BIOS and Disk Management. One restart later and it wasn't working again. Advanced Startup Options seems to detect 2 installations, one with no specified partition and one on partition 4. I think the one with no specified partition might be my NVMe, because in Disk Management, my SATA SSD (the only one that shows up) says Windows is on #4. When I try to boot from the one without a partition from Advanced Startup Options, it throws up the aforementioned 0x000000e BSOD.

fqanmh,ds445,Problem upgrading from GTX 1080 to RTX 2080 Ti,"Hi guys,

I bought my gaming PC back in mid-2016, mostly aimed at VR. The original PC was pre-configured by Alternate (German IT supplier) in cooperation with PC Games Hardware (the pre-eminent German PC Gaming Magazine), with the following specs:

* Core i7-6800K
* Asus Strix X99 Motherboard with pre-configured BIOS
* 1TB SSD + 3TB HDD
* 32GB DDR4 RAM 
* ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1080 AMP! Edition
* PSU Seasonic G-Series 550 SSR-550RM

It has always been running a pre-installed version of Windows 10, and has never had any problems; I barely got to use the PC for gaming these last few years, but used it for work mostly where it never showed any stability problems. I originally tried out a few VR experiences with the Oculus Rift CV1 and the original HTC Vive, which also never showed any problems.

I now decided to upgrade it (mostly for Half-Life Alyx, for which I also purchased a Valve Index headset) with a GTX 2080 Ti, for which I purchased a **ZOTAC RTX 2080 Ti ArcticStorm** graphics card alongside the Valve Index. I replaced the GTX 1080 with the RTX 2080 Ti (not all that easy because of the huge CPU cooler, but I managed...), updated the graphic card drivers to the very latest version (GeForce Game Ready 445.75 WHQL) and installed Half Life Alyx.

Steam VR initially worked just fine, but as soon as I'd launched HL-A for the first time, extreme studder started and within 30 seconds I had no more graphics output, neither on the Valve Index nor on the primary monitor. Rebooting the PC showed no obvious problems, but whenever I tried to launch Steam within minutes all output shut off - the PC didn't just freeze, but both the monitor and the Valve Index apparently were no longer receiving a signal; this happened multiple times as soon as I'd started SteamVR, something was obviously not okay.

I disconnected the Valve Index completely and installed the latest version of 3DMark to check if the system at least worked on a stand-alone basis or if there was anything wrong with the GPU itself; Windows BSODed during the download, but after a restart I could start 3DMark, albeit at a very low frame rate (mostly less than 10fps on a seemingly very low resolution), and could never get the benchmark to even complete, at some point I would always lose all output from the PC to the monitor - the PC seemed to be still running (at least power was still on), but the screen remained black and only a reset would bring back an image at all.

I subsequently reinstalled Windows 10 fresh, rolled back the driver to the previous version before 445.75, tried again... but no change, again extremely low FPS and within a few minutes I'd lose output to the monitor (whether the whole system froze in that situation I obviously don't know, but there was no way of getting back an image).

Frustrated, I replaced the RTX 2080 Ti by the previous GTX 1080, and everything worked just fine - I got about four to five times the FPS on 3DMark (on my 1080 compared to the 2080 Ti, that is!), SteamVR was working again and even Half Life Alyx seems to work just fine (I've only tested the first five minutes, but so far performance is fine and I've observed no crashes).

My question is: is my new RTX 2080 Ti defective and I should replace it, or is there some obvious incompatibility with my system that I'm not aware of? It seems an RTX 2080 Ti formally requires at least a 650W PSU (as compared to my 550W PSU), but there are plenty of opinions online that state that 550W should be fine - I've tried fiddling with my BIOS, resetting everything to default options with the RTX 2080 Ti installed, but that didn't seem to make a difference.

**Right now I see four options:**

1. Reinstall the 2080 Ti I have and fix an obvious problem somewhere that I've been overlooking so far
2. Return the 2080 Ti for an identical model because I should assume it's this specific one that's defective, and everything else is fine
3. Get a more powerful PSU, install that and continue with the 2080 Ti I have
4. Get a different graphics card (maybe a regular 2080 will do?) because for some reason my system isn't compatible with the specific 2080 Ti that I bought; maybe it's something about the water-cooling in this specific model of the 2080 Ti that I'm overlooking?

What do you think, and what would you suggest in terms of next steps in diagnostics here?

So here are my issues:

My Windows 10 PC will not connect to my house internet at all. It doesn't even connect to the network any time I try to connect it says ""Can't Connect To This Network"". My house internet works perfectly fine on my phone and all other devices in the house and worked fine on the PC up until yesterday, seemingly out of nowhere because it worked one minute and not the other. I also made a hotspot on my phone and the computer connected to that one no issues and the internet worked although extremely slowly as I do not get good mobile data signal where I live. However when I tried to connect to a hotspot from a different phone, same problem as with the house internet, it won't connect at all. Here's the thing though every so often it actually lets me connect to the house internet but even then the internet does not work. I can't even decide if it's the router or computers fault but here's a list of everything I have tried thus far without any success:

• Turned the router off and back on
• Reset the router to factory settings
• Forgot connection and reconnected
• Changed router DNS to Google's
• Changed PC DNS to Google's
• Checked for updates on network drivers 
• Uninstalled and reinstalled all network drivers
• Used command prompt to reset winsock and flush DNS
• Ran Network Troubleshooter
• Disabling ipv6

My laptop killed itself a couple of months ago by way of no longer turning on or appearing to charge. However, I was able to get it to do both for about 5 minutes which abruptly stopped when I knocked it. Upon partially removing the back of the laptop (one of the screws is stripped so I can't get it off properly) I've noticed that a lot of the parts are loose and there seems to be many screws missing other than just the main back plate screws.

* PM2.0×2.7

What would the equivalent Philips screws would be for the torx screws (which strip easily and are a pain)? Would buying a generic set of laptop screws work for these? (eg.

fqa4sg,Gaurav252002,Tried Fixing BOOT issue. Now PC wont even power ON.,"I might have broken my PC while trying to fix it.

About a WEEK ago I cleaned my PC with a blower, superficially, to remove dust because my games were crashing after a while of playing. I didnt mess with any wires. It worked great afterwards, no complaints. But the crashes continued. I felt my PC should be strong enough to handle the games without crashes like it used to so I downloaded MSI afterburner. I didnt mess with anything at first then 5 DAYS ago I started increasing the GPU power % to max and it worked the same. Then 4 DAYS ago, I made the GPU fan speed from auto to 100% before launching Overwatch. It worked GREAT all my crashes stopped in Overwatch. Then I launched COD warzone (which was working OK having only a couple crashes between every 3 or 4 games before the afterburner) which was acting weird. PC was not loading stuff properly. I closed the game. Nothing was responding, or it was but after a lot of delay. I couldnt turn the MSI afterburner settings to default. So I think I restarted the PC. And nothing was working anymore. Even chrome wasnt launching properly. I couldnt restart either. So I forced a restart from the button in the front. Now I got the BSOD saying ""BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO"". I have Win 10 so it tried auto repairs etc. Did not work. Still kept giving me the BSOD. So I tried cleaning the RAM as I have done many times before and put it back to no avail. I followed basic online advice for this BSOD from the video "" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt6H-mqF02g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt6H-mqF02g) "". I tried all of the methods. Nothing worked. It wasnt showing my profile like it showed in the video. When I tried to reset everything it said reset failed, no changes made. In the last method of the video, it said I couldnt find the pathway in my C: drive. I dont have a recovery backup or Windows recovery CD. At this point I went into my BIOS and changed the boot options order over and over. It didnt work any of the times. Then I opened my case to check for power supply to hard drives and it was good. Checked BIOS this time it didnt show my SSHD in the boot options. I thought I made some error in the rechecking of the wiring. Checked again. I couldnt find a mistake but I rechecked and rechecked. Could not find the problem. So I went into BIOS and I found something called secure boot. I thought it was like safe mode and I enabled it (This was stupid as I had no research about this). Restarted my PC. Now it wont even power on. Just turns all the lights on and all the fans on and then turns off and on again, and continues this cycle. I tried rechecking the wiring again. Still same ON and OFF.

Nvidia driver settings are set to default. 

When I first noticed the problem I was relying on Nvidia Geforce Experience and at the time it seemed like that software must have been confused about certain game settings. Some games it couldn't tell whether they were full screen or not. Otherwise it incorrectly diagnosed their resolution. This made it impossible to optimize some games, and several games including the two Doom games always changed their resolution when windows restarted, sometimes going higher, sometimes lower. 

I tried reinstalling the drivers. I tried different versions of drivers. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling geforce experience multiple times. I tried unplugging my Rift s to make sure it wasn't causing confusion somehow. Eventually I fully reinstalled windows. This solved the problem temporarily, but then it came back even worse and now the software was basically too laggy and unresponsive to use anymore. 

So finally I decided to just completely uninstall the software and give up on it. This seems to have partially solved the problem. Now only two games seem to change settings on their own, the two doom games. But on the other hand now they change their settings even more drastically. Before they would just change resolution, now they automatically default to the lowest possible aspect ratio. 

I'm absolutely clueless as to what is going on. It feels like my PC is possessed by some kind of trickster demon.

Thanks in advance for helping me out here...  


**Problem:**

When putting my PC under some light/moderate stress, I've been receiving a BSOD with the ""WHEA\_UNCORRECTABLE\_ERROR"" prompt. Initial googling makes me think this is perhaps a driver or hardware issue. The most often occurs when gaming - Tabletop Simulator, GTA, Rust, etc.

To provide some context, I had a similar issue with my last PC build. (Original thread found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/b2kj4v/bsod_whea_uncorrectable_error/).)

On my old PC, I changed my power settings to not let my CPU exceed 99%, per the recommendation of a poster, and that corrected my issue. I've performed the same action on my new PC which hasn't fixed my problem.

The second issue is really what's complicating everything, since I can rarely get the screen to show anything, and when I do, it only works a short time before freezing, forcing me to reboot, which brings me back to the blank screen. I've tried getting out of the blank screen loop by clearing the CMOS/flashing the BIOS which generally works, but of course the freezing comes in soon after and screws everything up. I'm hoping there's a way I can fix this without having to replace my graphics card since it's my most expensive part, but of course if that's what it comes down to, then so be it.

Anyway, so i have a Lenovo Yoga 15  (ThinkPad) Type 20DQ, i got it for free when i bought a few components, the guy said it didn't work. Sure enough there was an issue with the motherboard, didn't go check too much but most likely a power delivery failure somewhere along the line.

I found a used working board on Ebay, got it, tested it and it works fine. The only issue is the gyroscope and the accelerometer. Sometimes windows will think i want to use tablet mode and disables my keyboard, if i rotate the screen, the picture stays where it is, doesn't turn with the screen.

The autorotation is turned on, triple checked, checked for any driver updates, have them all, used Lenovo's system test tool thing and it found issues with those 2, but didn't say what, no surprise there.

I highly doubt the motherboard has the gyroscope and accelerometer on it, my guess is that it's somewhere in the screen area, problem is that it's not exactly an easy way to check since it's glued shut.

My question is, what are my options? has anyone had any similar issues with this laptop or a similar model? I really like the laptop, but getting a new monitor for it seems way too expensive just cause the gyroscope and accelerometer glitched out.

I was trying to install pop_os on my ssd alongside my windows installation to dual boot, but it gave me a warning saying that I was mounting a boot partition to a non-gpt drive. (It wouldnt let me install pop_os without a boot partition)

Being an idiot I used mbr2gpt and broke my windows installation, tried using the system recovery usb stick I had to no avail, and in a small fit of panic I installed pop_os on my drive.

I then tried 4 times to flash a win 10 installation media to my usb stick, but the first 3 times it wouldn't boot. The 4th time it told me that it couldnt find a necessary device or so and told me to use a windows installation media. Which is just. I don't know.

Now, trying to reformat my drive using the pop_os install media, thinking it needed it to be mbr or whatever, I have no idea, it gave me an error (though GParted did report no partitions after I did this) and I just gave up. This whole thing was over the span of ~5 hours.

I don't have another pc here, only macs, and in the past I've had no luck making installation medias with them. I also have no install cd. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, I can't go out to, say, a friend's house or something and use their pc to hopefully properly make an install usb stick (if that's even the problem here) and I'm lost.

I really need someone to help me here. I need my pc for school (especially now, as I have online classes daily) and while I could technically use linux, it would be really unconventional for me. I never wanted to replace windows, only to keep it while I learn.

If I don't respond: I'm in Italy and at the time of writing this it's 1 am. I'm having a breakdown over this and I want to sleep.

Some system specs/info you might need:
MOBO - Asrock Z270 Pro4 (BIOS was flashed about a year ago, I think)
CPU - Intel i5-7600k
I was running my usb sticks off a usb hub (which has never given me problems). One was the windows system repair stick but is now the win 10 installation media, the other is a pop_os 19.04 (iirc) installation media
Before anyone mentions it, I do have backups of my ssd. Sadly they arent .iso's, but I believe .xmt's? Something like that. There's also multiple files in my backup, as well as different folders. I used windows 10's disk image backup tool.

fq98uj,heretosaysomestuff,Internet Connectivity Issues,"Recently, my laptop began to have issues with internet connectivity, or at least retreiving pages. I first noticed this after returning home on Spring Break. After starting and activating Chrome I kept getting the error message of ""DNS Probe Finished No Internet"", despite having a strong connection to the router. Similar issues came up when I tried to use Edge. Occassionally I would be able to reach the sites for a few minutes before the internet seemed to cut out again, but it was always very slow. I figured it was simply an issue with the router, so I unplugged it, waited ten minutes or so, plugged it back in, and nothing had changed.

After that, I used a second laptop that I have (I have it for emergencies, but it does not have the storage space or processing power to be effective for work) to look up how to resolve the issue. I tried blocking, then unblocking my browsers in Windows Firewall, I tried running command prompts (NETSH WINSOCK, IPCONFIG/RESETDNS, etc., etc.) and nothing worked. Finally, I decided that perhaps it was an error with some sort of software, perhaps, and that an image restore was required. That didn't work out, so I moved my necessary files and programs onto an external harddrive and tried to reset my computer. The reset failed at about 15%, and undid all the changes, I tried the internet again, hoping something had worked, and it did seem more responsive, but still abysmally slow, and now there was the added problem that the internet did randomly disconnect. Up until this point I noticed I always had a strong connection, but there were DNS errors. 

So I did a tried to do a reset again, it failed, but allowed me to do a Factory Image Restore from the error page, which worked, I followed the setup, and was greeted with a pristine, clean Windows 10. I downloaded Chrome from Edge, noticed loading webpages was a little slow, but chalked that up to the reset, no cookies, etc. The Chrome download happened quickly, and I eagerly went to logging back into the sites I needed to get work done. Again, it was a little slow, but no cookies, maybe my wifi at home isn't as good as it was at school, etc. Then I got the error messages again.

This time, they included DNS PROBE FINISHED NO INTERNET, DNS PROBE FINSIHED NXDOMAIN, and ERROR NETWORK CHANGE, there may have been a few others, but those are the ones I remember.

Frustrated, I connected to ethernet, and it worked wonderfully, no one was home at this time, so I used it to connect for my online classes. After I disconnected from the ethernet, I noticed that the internet worked better. There were no error messages and it seemed faster, not as fast as it has been in the past, but faster than in more recent days. It stayed that way for a little, then failed again. This seems to keep happening whenever I connect to ethernet, I've tested it out. There is a bit more reliability now, but it is still horribly slow, and the errors keep coming.

A few more details:

*At my school, ther internet worked fine on my computer, there were some issues, but they were with the ISP.
*This has never happened with my home internet before, if anything it was always more reliable than at school.
*I have noticed that everything seems fine when I am close to the router, and stays that way for a short time, similar to what happens with the ethernet.
*It is only my work laptop that is having issues, the small, transportable one I use is fine, but no good for what I need to do, my brother and sister use theirs without issue, and phones work as well as they ever have.
*I am not very intelligent when it comes to using computers to actually find information on the computer that I am using, but the one having issues is a Dell Inspirion 15 3000 Series with a Win 10 Operating System, I do not know how to find out about the RAM or CPU.",0,1585354209,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fq98uj/internet_connectivity_issues/,techsupport,1

I go and check task manager, and my GPU is only at about 20-30% load. It was also sitting at around 100-105 degrees Fahrenheit. My CPU on the other hand, was at around 60% usage and 125 degrees. I don't have anything else open besides Chrome, Discord and Spotify. I don't have either my CPU or GPU boosted. Although I don't really need more frames for Minecraft, I want to fix this issue for the future so that when I play more graphic-intense games, I have good frames. Thanks in advance for the help.

I have a custom built iBuyPower PC from 2013, which I inherited from a friend who moved on to a different build. A few days ago, while on a Google Meet call with a dozen participants, the PC crashed to a BSoD and required a manual reset. The PC booted with no problems at all, and ran great for several days. Then today, when on a similar Google Meet call, the screen flickered for a split second then become black, but audio was still playing. After 10 or 15 seconds with no change, I attempted to reset the computer.

The PC reset originally and allowed me to log in, but after signing in it quickly crashed to a grey screen, with no changes for a full minute. After attempting to reset, there were significant visual glitches with the display, and it was no longer able to complete a boot (examples are here: [https://imgur.com/a/Oy9cddp](https://imgur.com/a/Oy9cddp))

After swapping out HDMI cables and ensuring that everything was fitted properly cable wise, and that the PC had significant time to cool down, there hasn't been any improvement. There's no way to get the PC to boot, even with a Windows Media Tool plugged in as was suggested by the blue Recovery screen you see in the imgur album.

* I believe that my graphics card is dead or dying based on what I've found online. Does this seem like the most likely cause? If not, what else could cause this problem?
* If it is in fact the graphics card, is replacement the only solution?
* Lastly, could the fact that it crashed both times while running the same software (but did not struggle after the first crash when playing games or streaming multiple HD video sources) have anything to do with the problem?

My games open and run a lot better after the upgrade but within 1/2 minutes they act weird. CS:GO will go black, and then the game window will display a blown up version of my desktop. One thing to note is that I use 4:3 resolution on a 16:9 monitor although it never used to cause me issues.

I also wanted to be ready for the PS5 when it launches! I don’t have a PC and don’t have any plans for one at the moment. So cool, I have a neat console gaming setup now, right?

Well, I’m having some problems. As far as I can tell, the LG 27UK650 doesn’t have any hard buttons on the monitor itself. Not having a PC means that I can’t adjust ANYTHING. I can’t calibrate my new monitor, and I’m tired of windows sporadically popping up telling me to make sure and use the included HDMI cables (I can’t close them, and I can’t choose to stop being shown that message).

I can’t even switch between HDMI 1 and 2. Whatever is on 1 seems to be what’s displayed by default.

Is there any way to recover deleted Google Chrome browsing history from an Android phone? I know the date and the time frame on said date for the particular website I'm trying to recover. And I stopped using the phone about a week after because I got a new one, so that history should be relatively fresh. Is there any kind of software I can get or download that could do it? Or are there professional IT / tech support people who can do this (I live near a city)?

Also, I do NOT have a Google account, so no... I cannot go to My Activity and see a copy of it. I learned my lesson and do have an account now tho on my new phone.

Is there anyway to retrieve the history? It's really important that I do.

I've always had FPS issues with it.  
I've sent it in for an RMA, They replaced the board, sent it back and it still had FPS issues.  
(Best part is that they deleted the factory image I had on the computer so I couldn't even factory reset it, didn't know about that until yesterday)  
The battery recently died on it, Zero charge, turns off the second you unplug it.  
I took it in to get it looked at at a local shop to just put a brand new install of windows on it and get the drivers set up, and he replaced the thermal paste.  
It's still having issues with FPS lag, He's still researching into it to see if he can figure out what's up so he's still working with me on the issue, but i'm hoping to find somebody here that might have experience with these laptops and could tell me what to do.  


Apex Legends idles around 100 fps then tanks to 30 fps, Skyrim fluxuates between 150 and 20 fps constantly, Rimworld even has lag spikes, Sims 4 has lag spikes, Fortnite used to have lag spikes(stopped playing).  
I've pretty much resorted to playing Oldschool Runescape \*I don't mind I enjoy the game\*

fq8253,user_guy,"Realtek Microphone Driver ""Device not migrated"" Issue","I have been having issues getting my microphone to work. It worked several months ago but when I went to use it recently it was not working. When I plug it in Windows recognizes it but no sound comes through. It works on another computer so I know it's not the mic. I went through all of the troubleshooting steps from confirming my mic was showing up in the device manager to checking all of the privacy settings in windows. I'll list all of the stuff I have tried below along with my system info. 

I think I found the problem however. When I look at the device events under the device manager screen I see and event saying: ""Device not migrated"" [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/xSXo92C). But when you look at the general tab it says ""This device is working properly."" 

When looking up solutions to the device not migrated it says to try and reinstall the driver to a more current one or to roll back to one that was working before. Well it won't let me roll back and the new driver I installed as part of my other troubleshooting isn't working either. I'm about out of ideas on possible fixes. At this point I am getting close to doing a fresh install of windows to see if that fixes it.

If anyone has any other ideas or possible fixes I would be super grateful!

List of troubleshooting done:
*Confirmed mic is showing up under devices
*Checked windows 10 settings to make sure privacy settings were not changed
*Made sure device was not disabled
*Tried windows auto updating drivers and it said most current drivers were being used
*Manually removed device drivers and installed drivers from Gigabytes website
*Tried both front and rear mic inputs on computer(both allowed windows to see device as a mic but did not pick up any audio)
*No there is no physical mute button on mic so that is not an issue
*Ran windows troubleshooter, said no issues found
*Ran Windows system file checker and it found some issues but did not fix anything with the mic

* I've checked for overheating. Nothing ever gets above 70-75C.

* I tried playing games on very low settings and I still get the same, no change, sometimes it even crashes on start up. I thought it's because of my PSU since it was a 450W 80plus Bronze. I have since then upgraded it to a CorsairTX850M. Unfortunately, this did not fix the issues I'm having. I had a clean windows install, also this does not work.

* I have stress tested my pc using Furmark and everything runs smoothly. No overheating as far as I can see and I get decent FPS.

Is there anything else I can still try? Thanks!

Yesterday whilst I was playing, my aux cable for my earphones literally scrapped it and it caused it to crash . I have attached the image of what the crash looks like.

Hello, I just wanted to get some input from you good people as to what is wrong with my PC. I play a lot of PC games and for a long while my PC has not been performing to its capabilities. I have a 144 Hz monitor and playing games like CS:GO, Overwatch, League of Legends, etc. won't stay consistently above 144 frames while I am playing. I'm also playing these games on the lowest settings and still can not increase performance to where it needs to be. 

I recently realized that my old CPU was bottlenecking my GPU so I replaced it with the one listed above. Even with the replacement of my CPU, I am still getting issues. What really started to make me concerned is my performance in the game Jedi Fallen Order. I am constantly dropping below 60 frames in that game and I meet the recommended requirements that Steam lists on the store page. 

Here is a screenshot of my MSI Afterburner graphs and you will be able to see my issues. https://gyazo.com/4ec8cd2ded49f9d73c2674091f4de755

-Making sure correct drivers are installed
-Closing out any necessary background programs 
-Overclocking both my CPU and GPU
-Cleaning my PC
-Reinstalling Windows
-Power Settings are set to max performance

fq6lrb,puiu2001,RTX 2080Ti Failing,"  

A little back story:

I was boringly cruising the facebook marketplace (because the pandemic had just started and this was the third day in) looking for just about anything, and I stumble on a rtx 2080ti zotac extreme listed for 950$. I shot the guy a pm saying I’d do 850 for it, and he said 860$ and I got a deal, so I accepted and met up with him and picked it up. I bring the card home and install it.

Pc Specs:

Intel Core I7 4790k

Crucial 4g of gddr3 ram X 4

ASrock z97 Extreme 4 mother board

Zotac Rxt2080ti amp triple fan

Corsair 750x power supply

Acer Predator xb252q (240hz,1080p)

Vizo tv 24 inch

After I initially installed the card the first game I launched up was gta v. It ran amazingly getting high 100fps on maxed settings. Later that day my friend had just bought Bo3 and had zombies with all the dlc. Me and my brother wanted to play together so I move my pc closer to our 4k tv so we can do split screen while we wait for my friend to finish downloading and installing the game. We play for about 45 min to an hour until we had died and just decided to wait for my friend. Then I remembered how I used to do split screen with my brother’s screen on the tv and my monitor with my screen. I set that up and we start playing. We played for about 30-40 min no problem until my screen freezes and I get a BSOD saying the VIDEO\_SCHEDULER\_INTERNAL\_ERROR. I chalked it up to nothing rebooted my pc launched cod again and played for another 15-20 min until yet again a crash. And at that point I was like wtf, what going on. I go to unplug my pc because the way I had my graphics card installed it was right above the m.2 card and I thought the heat of the card was causing my m.2 card to fail and cause a blue scree. But when I unplug my power supply (the computer wasn’t all the way off, like windows had shut down but the fans were still spinning) I hear a weird noise, I don’t think much about it and start taking apart my pc. I move my graphics card down one slot right under the m.2 card rather than right over it. I go to start up my pc and nothing, I tried uninstalling everything an reinstalling everything still nothing. It was late at night and I was f this im going to sleep, leave tomorrows problems to nicks tomorrow and I went to sleep. Long story short, I ended firing my psu(which was a 650w) and ended up buying a corsair 750w gold certified one, but not only that, but I originally chalked up the problem to be the motherboard for some reason, and I became careless when taking out the processor and ended up bending a pin on the motherboard (facepalm), and out of stroke of luck(because of the virus the fastest time a 1150 motherboard could have come in was in mid April and my microcenter didn’t have any) my neighbor had built a pc at the same time as me and had a asrock z97 extreme 4 that he no longer used and I bought that off of him. So after that whole problem was fixed I went on to reinstall everything and get the pc running. I launched up csgo to see how it ran, it played great for 20 min until it crashed and gave me the same BSOD as the night before. I then remembered that early in the life of these cards that there had been a problem with the vram, but according to the seller this card was new in September. So, I investigated all my software, using Display Driver uninstaller countless times and updating every driver along with my motherboard bios. Still nothing fixed the crashes. Then I decide to play Shadow of war and the game played fine, which was very weird, no crashed nothing, I played for about an hour. Then I come back later that day to play and launch up the game and I start getting artifacting(not the XD artifacting, but just rgb dots everywhere) and my game would freeze, occasionally after this freeze I’d get the same BSOD as before or id get an instant crash. While resetting my pc many times my monitor started to say no signal. So, I decided to use the hdmi port on the graphics card and monitor, and then my computer finally launched to the log in screen on I got in. But I couldn’t stand this because my monitor was a 240hz monitor but it only had a hdmi 1.4(or 1.2 forgot which one was a legit thing) so it would only support 1080p at 60hz. I test my monitor on many different laptops using a HDMI to diplay port adapter and still the monitor reads no signal and shuts down. I then take apart my monitor to see if there was anything wrong inside of it, but nothing was wrong, I said screw this im done, I went to sleep and the next day I put the monitor back together saying that I’ll get a new one when the time comes and ill just have to use 60hz. But for the shitz and giggles I plugged the display port back into the monitor and the display works, and at that point I thought god was on my side. I launch everything back up and go to play some games, and still get the artifacting. Then this was when I was about to make a forum post about the card to see what was wrong, but right before I was about to make this post I decided to buy 3dmark, it was only like 5 bucks and run it. And of course, it crashed my pc again. This is when I decided to get the other monitor to see if the temps of the card were reading to high right before the crash, so I run 3dmark again and the temps don’t go above 63 before crashing. So then I decided that I was going to record for the form what was happening, but I was going to run 3dmark only on one monitor at a time, and I started with the vizo tv, I started the spy 3dmark and of course knowing my luck everything worked absolutely fine, I launched up Shadow of war and I played for an hour with no actifacting. I was like no way its fixed, but im still going to hook it up to my other monitor because something was wrong with that monitor and ill post that to the forum. Nope I launched up windows and everything worked fine, I go to nvida control panel because for some reason I thought the gsync option the monitor had was causing the blue screens or something along those lines. So, I go to launch up 3dmark The spy and still ready to record if anything crashes, and nope nothing crashes, I launch up shadow of war to see if it was artifacting, it wasn’t. I Played shadow of war for 2-3 hours then shut down my pc. Not more than 2 hours later my brother wants to play zombies again with my friend. I hook up the same split screen we had going before. Before I could even launch the game, the card would fail and I’d get the blue screen. Then the pc wouldn’t even start up in normal mode, it would get to the windows loading screen give me a bunch of pink lines (as shown in this video, although in this video it’s happening when I enable and disable the drivers, it would do the same thing when launching: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdtqOEbH-i85llWRt94YgSz-nKBr-oHU/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdtqOEbH-i85llWRt94YgSz-nKBr-oHU/view?usp=sharing)) and then it would be launch in safe mode. I gave up for that night and started again this morning. This morning I did a clean sweep of windows and reinstalled it, to no avail. I am at this point certain that it has to do with the vram, but if anyone else has any tips for me I’m all ears. I did take the card apart and it does have the micron vram.

**LINK TO SPECCY**: [https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28](https://ufile.io/6gv3ro28)

PC was bought 2 years ago and it already started freezing very rarely from the start.  
I ignored it and hoped it would stop in the future.

When the problem occurs, computer completely hard freezes. The audio and screen stops. I can't even move the mouse or turn on caps/num/scroll lock on the keyboard.  
I thought the problem was in my old HDD from 2007. It was the only old component and I bought a new one. The freeze was STILL there after replacement.

I was not playing games in the first 2 years. The freeze happened sometimes when the movie was playing or when randomly browsing internet.  
Recently, I started gaming and that's when the freezes started occuring more frequently.  
**They are totally random and it can happen when I start the game or hours and hours in playtime.** I use Discord while gaming if that's important.

PC says my Ryzen integrated graphics is not working properly, so it automatically shut it down and I did it manually.

**Things I've tried:**

\- fresh reinstalled Windows

\- installed newest drivers for most of the components

\- tried changing power from balanced to high performance

\- testing RAM on MemTest86, the test lasted for like 2-3 hours and it said everything is fine

\- CrystalDiskInfo and CrystalDiskMark said my HDD and SSD are healthy

\- scanned for malware

\- System file checker - when I typed sfc /scannow, my computer completely froze 2 times and after **chkdsk** finished, the sfc /scannow completed and said there were no errors

\- tested GPU with FurMark - everything was fine with the temperatures

\- **tested CPU with Prime95 - I can't run it for even 15 mins and my CPU temperature quickly rises to more than 85 °C and I shut it down. I disabled AVX. The CPU fan is working normally.**",5,1585344505,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fq67ps/pc_keeps_hard_freezing/,techsupport,1

Games are also not playable as they crash everytime after loading screens. This was not a problem prior to upgrading my PC, this happened once after I tried overclocking my GPU but then reverted after my game crashing after 10 minutes of play time and stopped after that.

I recently upgraded my motherboard, cpu and ram this made these problems a lot more frequent and I feel like it might be one of these componenets causing the issues,

I have tried : reinstalling windows, getting the newest drivers for my GPU, updating all of my windows drivers, removing and reinsterting my GPU, moving my RAM to another slot, checking hard drive for corrupted files, updating BIOS, updating windows to 1909, running memtest86 which showed no errors, running crysteldisk which showed no problems for my hard drive.

The only problem I ecountred was when I was testing my GPU on MSI Afterburner which instantly came up with BSOD as soon as I pressed the test button with the code video\_scheduler\_internal\_error I then ran it again after my PC restarted but it fully ran through the test and came up with safe confidence 90% with no overclocking.

BSOD say video\_scheduler\_internal\_error

Some games such as World of Tanks and Civ 5 come up with an error message saying that my drivers are not updated.

Anything would help as I have been searching for a long time, and Im going to be shit bored for coronavirus without no games.

fq62q3,bbmaster123,"Is my monitor dead, or is it the power cable?","Please let me know if this is not the best subreddit, sorry in advanced if it's not. 

I've got an old Planar PX212m that I had used for about 15 years. I've since replaced it with a decent 4k monitor, but still have the old one laying around.

While in daily use, the power cable, which outputs 12v 6.67a over a 4 pin connector, used to have a degree of coil whine, but it was really no big deal. 

One day I turned on my monitor, the green LED came on, then switched to orange, no display. I had a spare monitor and spare pc, so I swapped the monitors. The planar was dead, my pc was fine. The orange LED stays lit until the power is removed.

When plugged in and the monitor turned off, there is no coil whine. Turn the monitor on, tons of whine, and once it goes into standby, some coil whine but not as bad.

Now today with all the lockdowns going on, my mum is doing her conferences over microsoft teams, and seems to be having a bit of trouble with it all on her laptop. I figured a bigger brighter and higher res screen could help, but the planar is the only thing I have on hand at the moment.

Before I shell out money to buy a replacement power supply, can someone let me know if this sounds like that would work?

One last thing, I did open up the monitor enough the look at the circuit board and caps, and they all visually appear fine, and they don't whine under power, but I don't have a multimeter to actually test them. 

Thanks to anyone who read through all this!

If anyone can help., would be really nice!   


I am not sure what is wrong with my PC and I need somebody who had similar expriences to help me see what is going on.  


It just won't turn on. PSU is working (at least with jump - start), not sure if that method is like 100% sure to diagnose it that it works...  


When I press power button, there is a single beam of flashing light in PSU and you can hear something like CLICK!.   
And that's it...   
Doesn't move from there, I am afraid it COULD be my motherboard ( OC Genie 4 - MSI ), when I perform the power drainage (holding the button without the PSU cabel in for 20 seconds) after 10 seconds there is a blinking light on the motherboard, and it blinks simulteanously for 20 - 30 seconds. In user manual they sad it stands for DEBUG!   
Took out the battery out already, RAM, SSD-s, everything stays the same...still haven't managed to take out my GPU-s out, because I have a water cooling system inside which is directly connected to GPU-s, didn't have time to do that yet...  


  
If anybody would have had any idea what could've cause the problem, please help me...  


I don't want to order anything yet, cause I'm not sure what is causing the problem, if anybody knows anything please comment.

fq5sx9,TGODNeilan,BSOD while playin MW and streaming,"So i've been having an issue with getting blue screens while playing Modern Warfare but only while I am streaming with OBS studio at the same time. Other than when I'm doing these two things specifically, the PC runs perfectly fine with no issues at all. 

The recent BSODs were page fault in non paged area errors, and earlier in November or so when Modern Warfare originally launched, i was receiving Kernal Trap BSODs. I had installed 16gb more RAM right before MW released so was sure the RAM was bad but have taken it out and tried with only the previous 16gb RAM and received the same errors. Also sent the new RAM back just in case and the replacement kit had the same issue happening. So not sure its the RAM now.  


i9 9900k slight OC  
Asus Strix RTX 2080 slight OC  
Asus Strix z390-e Mobo  
Gskill trident z 3200mhz RAM with XMP on (either 16GB or 32GB if i have the new sticks in)  
970 Evo Pro m.2 SSD

i have ran chkdsk and sfc and found no issues and the problem persists. The GPU was slightly OCd as well but ive tried without the OC and that wasn't causing the issue. 

I have not tried getting rid of the OC on the CPU yet, nor have i tried turning XMP off yet for the RAM. Im assuming this should be my next step of testing? Or is there something obvious im just missing. Mobo is on BIOS version 1302 and from ASUS website there is now v1401 with ""Improve Memory overclocking rules"" listed. Will likely wait to try this last unless someone suggests otherwise.

Im also not sure if the problem is just with MW itself as Im sure its not OBS studio or the stream, because i can stream other games just fine. But i can also play MW just fine as long as the stream is not on. Just not sure what to do now. I've included some dump files from the BSODs I could find if they are of any help. Thanks you!

fq5p44,KDA_Eve,ASUS Laptop WiFi problem random high constant ping,"Hello! I've been dealing with a certain problem for a while now, and after trying every single 'fix' possible, i am at a loss. I have an Asus laptop, model x509fa, and i have this weird problem regarding the wireless connection.   


To do a summary, here's what's happening. I've noticed this issue while playing online games (such as League of Legends) so i'll use that as an example. When i get into a game, the ping starts off perfectly fine, at around 50 constant ms. But many times per day, it would **randomly** jump to 500 in a split second, and it would stay like that forever unless i connect to another wifi network (my phone's hotspot) and then switch back to the original one (my router).   


Now, what i tried doing, is i went ahead and tried to ping my network in cmd and did a little test. Firstly, i pinged it as soon as i went into a game and saw that my ping was fine, and the results were perfectly normal. No packet loss, normal ping. And for the other test, i went ahead and pinged it as soon as it jumped to 500 ping (in game) and the results were completely different. Instead of normal ping, it would be a flux between a constant 300-500. So i think it's safe to say it has nothing to do with the specific game, since ANY online game, or call (such as a voice call on discord) would randomly have that ping.  


Before anything, i want to specify i have tried many, many different things. Tried updating my drivers (they were up to date), reinstalled them, did a network reset, cmd commands such as flushdns or net winsock reset / netsh int ipv4 reset etc. I tried doing every single 'easy fix' possible, but with no luck. What bothers me, is that this is my third laptop, and the previous two, which were connected to the exact same router as always, had no problems whatsoever, and i've never had any issues regarding the ping with them. Although today, i finally thought i fixed the problem by following advice from a board, saying that they uninstalled intel PROset wireless. I managed to play many games with perfect ping(something that never happened before, as in so many consecutive games without this problem) but tonight the issue was back.  


What i don't understand, is what's exactly causing it. After trying so many different things, my only thought that's left, is that the laptop has a problem with its network card. Because it's not ping spikes or something like that. It's literally the ping being perfect, and then suddenly jumping to \~500 and staying like that in a **constant** manner, **unlesss** i connect to a new network and then connect back to the original one. And this happens around once/twice per a 40 minute game. Thank you so much in advance, and i'd be extremely grateful if someone could share some light over this, because i haven't been able to find almost anything online.",2,1585343002,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fq5p44/asus_laptop_wifi_problem_random_high_constant_ping/,techsupport,1
fq5ogi,GonzaSpectre,Zimbra Ajax Webmail slow/not loading.,"**The issue:**

We are facing a somewhat strange issue regarding the Zimbra Ajax webmail interface. Sometimes it loads, although most times it won’t (the html one always loads). 

Most of the times it gets stuck at the loading screen or it just displays a white screen. This only happens on windows and macOS, linux clients load flawlessly.

It’s also worth mentioning that if you input a wrong password it won’t get stuck and will refresh the login.

**What we tried:**

We have been checking the different logs on the server either those on /var/log/ and those on /opt/zimbra/log/ to no avail.

We tried almost all the suggestions and fixes found on zimbra's and other's forums, also re-installed not only Zimbra but the whole OS, not only once, but twice, always running into the same issue with Ubuntu Server 16.04LTS, 18.04LTS and CentOS 7 with no luck.

**Our configuration:**

Zimbra version: 8.8.15 GA 3869

DNS configuration:

\-server.domain.com (this server) (A record)

\-subdomain.domain.com (the (sub)domain this server uses, the MX record in this subdomain points to server.domain.com)

IP configuration:

The server has a private IP (192.168.100.11), this being the case we had to install dnsmasq (config. pasted below) and edit the /etc/hosts file (also pasted) so it would work.

**Other:**

During the installation process the installer throws this error, which we solved this way:

    DNS ERROR resolving MX for server.domain.com
    It is suggested that the domain name have an MX record configured in DNS
    Change domain name? [Yes] yes

fq5fqi,YotasAndPolestars,Should removing a CPU delete the data saved on two SSDs configured in RAID0?,"Hey, there. 

I've been experiencing some cooling issues on my desktop that I built a few months back. At the recommendation of some people on /r/buildapc, I took out my CPU, wiped it down and reapplied the thermal compound. All seems to be fine and dandy on the CPU end - no bent pins, no paste where it shouldn't be, the motherboard reads the CPU correctly, etc. The problem arises when I try to boot the system, as it can't seem to find the OS. 

&gt;Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key. 

I had Windows 10 stored on two 1TB Samsung 970 Evos configured in RAID0. I know the risk of data loss by configuring them in this manner, but I only keep a few games, some programs and the OS stored on them (all of my important data is stored on two external HDDs), so I figured it wasn't much of a risk when I'd be teaching myself something new, and gaining a little bit of convenience and performance. 

So here we are now. The BIOS shows that the SSDs are now separate and Windows 10 is apparently gone. Is this normal behavior? How can I prevent this from happening in the future on the off-chance I need to clean my CPU again, or perhaps upgrade when it becomes worthwhile? Is it possible to get my data back?

fq5eah,JMak00,EVGA 2070 Super XC temps + Case Fan configuration help,"I'm experiencing higher than expected temps with my video card since my switch from a XFX RX 580 a few months ago. That card would run around 50-54c when overclocked while playing games. This 2070, though, is running at 60c at stock.

Now, one major difference is that when I was running the 580, I was using a 27"" 1080p display and I have since upgraded to 3 1440p displays, 1 of which is a 34"" ultrawide display.

Is this not surprising given the additional displays and big increase in the number of pixels being driven?

I have a custom fan curve going wherein the fans are set at less than 30% when the temp is 35c and below and once the card hits 50c I have the fans ramping up to 50% and up to 60% when the temps hit 60c. The high pitch whine at 60c is driving me crazy.

I normally wouldn't bothered with it, but I have case fans in case and, despite that, I have to take off the mesh front cover when gaming just to keep overall temps down and, ugh, it gets loud.

Fan layout is as follows: 3 120mm intakes up front; 3 120mm intakes at top, incl 1 blowing directly down on the cpu air cooler); 2 120mm intakes on bottom; and 1 120mm intake at rear. Now, they don't all run at the same speed - the 3 front are turned up and the top rear and rear fans are also turned up, otherwise, the rest are set to run silent.

I'm thinking that the gpu may be heating up because while I have a lot of fans, there may not be a consistent path of airflow moving over the gpu to push out that heat. Although, when I place my hand at the rear of the case, I feel a steady stream of warm coming out right behind the gpu.

I have a Senheiser PXC 550 Headset and am trying to connect it to my ASUS laptop (WIN 10). 

The PC doesn't have bluetooth so I got myself an USB bluetooth adapter which does work without any problems with other devices like my phone or my bluetooth speaker but somehow it just won't recognize the Headset as Audio device but rather as another random device. I can find and connect the Headset normally but instead of showing it as audio device like it does with my speaker it gets listed under ""other devices"" and the Icon is differend to the speaker's too. I can even connect it and it says it is coupled up but as I said not as audio, so it will simply not work.

Oh and the Headser itself can't be the problem either since its working perfectly with my phone.

The first time I inserted the adapter charger plug into the side, I found it really hard to push in, like REALLY hard. I had to be careful not to push too hard or it will slam in instead of glide in.

I assumed over time the clamps holding the plug in place would loosen through regular use but it is still stiff sliding in. I examined the plug and found nothing inside that appears to be blocking it. I wiped the charger tip, used a dustbuster to vacuum any foreign matter out of the side hole, and then gently sprayed compressed air inside the side hole as well. It's still sliding in with some resistance. 

The adapter came with the laptop so I know it's the right one for this laptop. There's no problem with charging the battery either. It's just a pain in the butt to connect the adapter plug to the laptop because I don't want to break it accidentally.

I got everything hooked up, but when I tried to run it my monitor receives no signal, despite it being fine just hours ago.


I restarted the computer a few times and unplugged and replugged the HDMI cable. I tried using the DVI port instead (though admittedly with a Frankenstein setup of vga to dvi adapters), still nothing. I ensured the gpu was in the pci slot, but no good. I swapped into another pci slot after checking that both were free of dust, but still no result. I've opened the case up a few times to see if I forgot to connect something, but I can't see anything amiss. 


I did some searching around and the best I could find on the subject is that Win 10 doesn't play nice with new gpus and I have to re-enable the gpu in device manager. Problem is, since my motherboard has no integrated graphics, I can't see anything to get to the device manager. I don't even know if the computer is booting all the way.


Has anyone had a similar problem, or know how to fix this? At the very least, is there a way to navigate to device manager blind so as to let windows detect the gpu? Or do I have no choice but to get a new motherboard? I'm at my wits end here.

Gpu- GTX 1070 FTW

Psu- EVGA 650W

To preface the event, I had terrible performance while playing COD Warzone so thought that if i overclocked my Cpu a bit I would have better performance. Since this was my first time OC i looked up a guide from a reputable forum, i found a guide on an ROG site that had what I was looking for. To summarize, what I did was turn the OC tuner to manual at 100 then i synced all cores to x43 and disabled Speedstep and C states. The guide did give an approximate voltage setting but it also said that using the Auto function was fine so i did not touch any voltage settings. 

After the OC it was pretty stable, I did not really run any tests aside from just playing Warzone and seeing if i had any better luck. I did have a slight boost in playability but i really  didn't notice it. I left the OC for a few days until recently when i was playing with my group and my PC lagged hard when alt tabbing and took a minute to get back into the game. Then twoards the end of the game my PC made beeping noises. Either 2 short and 1 long or vice versa. First thing i thought was temps but i had been monitoring temps with Open hardware monitior and my temps didn't exceed 60c.  

I rebooted and turned the OC off and played a less taxing game and maybe a few minutes in I had the same beeping noises. As of right now my PC is not under load and is working fine. However, i did notice that my clock speeds are fluctuating from 800mhz back to the stock turbo 3.9ghz depending on the load. 

I am quite confused as to what the issue is, I have checked my cpu fan also and it is indeed working and not an issue also.

fq4o07,plantman828,Mac SSD to Windows Desktop,"I upgraded my wife's Macbook pro from 2011 with an 860 EVO 1tb and after a week or so, the Macbook stopped working. Everything worked fine up until then and I had installed a Time Machine from my 2012 IMac onto the SSD. Once it stopped working, every time I would power up the Macbook it would give me a stop sign and shut down, continually doing this over and over. I was told that there may be something wrong with the hardware on the machine and it would cost too much to fix. I decided to retire the Macbook and we have since purchased a new Macbook air for her.

I removed the 860 EVO from the Macbook pro and I have since installed into my PC that I built. With this said, it is not showing up in Disk Management so I am wondering if perhaps my SATA port is not working or perhaps the SSD is now corrupt? I tried plugging it into two different available SATA ports on my motherboard. I have 5 other SSDs hooked up to the PC that work fine.

I am not sure if I should give up on this SSD or not.

Any suggestions?

A photo is taken every 10 minutes and the project is approaching two months for a total of 7,034 images at 173GB. The flower is beginning to close and I have now begun to consider how I will process the images in Lightroom.

Normally I would sync an edit across all of the images in order to avoid processing the images individually, but because the lighting situation in each image is different across time this wouldn't work. I want to organize the images by the **hour** that they were taken to group them by their lighting situation and edit the groups individually in Lightroom to be processed and exported to Premiere to create the video.

Windows file explorer only lets me sort by date taken, and manually grouping and editing the images in Lightroom would take forever. My google search led me \[here\](https://photo.stackexchange.com/questions/108023/how-to-sort-photos-by-time-while-ignoring-date) which describes the use of ExifTool. This program doesn't have a UI and it'll take me a while to figure it out, a task perhaps more daunting than editing these images individually in Lightroom.

Searching for the file name of one of the still-existing photos in all documents

Searching for \*.jpeg and  IMG in all files and visually scanning 

Ran Windows Protection for malware (I read some malware can eat files, but no threats were found)

Right-clicked on the containing desktop folder and undid actions as far back as it would let me 

Right-clicked on folder AND recycle bin to restore previous versions- non existed

fq47y2,sylentsnyper,Stream video falls exponentially behind audio.,"Hello r/techsupport, if anyone possibly has some suggestions to help me it would be appreciated as I am at my wits end.

The issue:  
What feels like started about 8 months ago now (just a guess), whenever I watch anything online (twitch, amazon prime, youtube, etc) my video slowly starts getting further behind the audio I hear. When first starting, or after refreshing, the two stay in sync for a tiny bit before audio starts getting ahead. This issue happens exponentially, in the beginning being barely noticeable but within minutes it quickly devolves into being full seconds behind. Probably the furthest I've let it fall behind is like about 30 second desync before losing my mind and refreshing. I use my PC mostly for gaming, and as far as I can tell when not using my headset I don't believe the issue happens, or I just haven't noticed. I've tried setting it up for failure while gaming, by going to a firing range in some shooters I play and seeing if the sounds I hear don't line up with the shots I am testing with, but I've never noticed it being out of sync.

Notable thing:  
This issue does not occur if I am using my logitech 430 headset via the USB plug it has, which I am guessing is acting as a sound card and is fixing the issue. However, if I take the headphone wire out of the dongle and put it into my headphone jack then the desync will become an issue again as though coming through my speakers.

PC specs:  
OS: Windows 10 (64 bit)  
GPU: EVGA 1060 6gb  
CPU: i5-7600k  
RAM: 16gb DDR4  
Mobo: Gigabyte Z270

Things I have already attempted/eliminated:  
Multiple browsers, issues is consistent among all of them.
In browsers disable hardware acceleration.  
Sound settings, disabled enhancements and acceleration.  
Uninstalled and reinstall+update GPU drivers (rollback was unavailable).  
Uninstalled and realtek audio drivers (rollback was unavailable).  
Disabled fast boot in both windows and bios.  
Using different ports/wires.  
Updating Windows.  
Unsure if I am forgetting anything else.

If anyone has any other ideas of the issue or of what to try before resorting to completely reinstalling everything it would be super appreciated.

* CPU: Ryzen 2700X
* GPU: 1660 TI
* RAM: 2x8 DDR4-3200
* Windows 10

Lately, I’ve noticed my GPU usage is getting hard-capped at 40%, not going a single percent over. This is leading to fps loss in every game and just general stuttering when in regular use.

It doesn’t appear to be a bottleneck issue, as this happens regardless of the game, even when CPU and ram are at less than 3% and 20% usage respectively. New Nvidia drivers rolled out earlier this week before I noticed the issue, and reverting back to a previous driver didn’t help either.

I was trying to install a new SSD (not replacing my original C drive).

Turned on computer and it started booting but everything was in Japanese or Chinese...  OK, so I unplugged the new SSD and rebooted with everything as it was before this started.

Now, my SSD is not being recognized in the BIOS.  When I go into UEFI setup I see my HDD but not the main boot SSD.  I noticed that the setting changed to RAID enabled.  Could this have damaged my primary boot SSD???

I'm really screwed here if I can't get my primary drive recognized/working.  I've tried resetting the UEFI defaults, resetting CMOS.  Trying to figure out what to do next.

My first question is, would my cpu fan be the issue here? I understand if it is cooked I should replace it, however I don't understand why the CPU would be running at ok temperatures and the GPU is so hot when the fan is only connected to the CPU. 

Also, I tried to troubleshoot myself by putting my brothers Radeon rx 560 in, but when I booted it up this ( https://imgur.com/a/ZEdJDrk ) was all I saw.

fq3ebw,OkGeneral3,Computer only performs wel in games when GPU fans are spinning at higher rates.,"For some reason whatever game i play always stutters and just plays badly despite the fps being high and my pc being able to handle the game. (specs are below) Were talking mainly fps drops and stutters.

After i forced my GPU fans to spin faster using the AMD radeon software my games seemed to run just fine. the stuttering was mostly gone. after setting everything back to normal it started lagging again. This led me to believe perhaps my system/gpu is underperforming and not being utilized properly. My cpu and gpu temps are fine and within safe limits. gpu temps are about 80-90 when playing. 

Perhaps my issue can be solved by tweaking the GPU settings? sadly i dont know much about it and i cant get it right perfectly. and besides this shouldnt be happening in the first place.

fq2mxg,whoshearts,"DPC Latency and ""robotic"" audio playback - cracks, pops, high CPU.","Hello, I've been having an unfortunate problem with my audio for about two months now and I'm looking for any help I can get. I will literally donate money to the person that helps me solve this issue, as it is driving me crazy. 

[Here is a link I posted to my audio interface manufacturer's subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Focusrite/comments/f51ejh/3rd_gen_2i2_playback_becomes_robotic_sounding/)

I don't remember having this problem until I updated my Scarlet 2i2 gen 2 Audio Interface to a gen 3 of the same interface. 

I notice this problem when listening to Lofi Beats to Study and Chill to, on Zoom, and when I'm playing video games. My quick fix is to open the Focusrite Audio Panel and change my sample rate, then change it back. My default sample rate is 48000. Higher buffer sizes, for example 1024, make my audio consistently fuzzy and slightly robotic, so my buffer size is set to 128. 

These are my PC's stats:

* Windows 10 , 10.0, build: 18363 (x64)
* Mobo: Asrock TRX40 Taichi
* Processor: AMD Ryzen 3960x Threadripper
* Video Card: EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 TI
* PSU: Seasonic Focus 750w Gold
* RAM: PCL Premium 16gb 3600Mhz

Here is some LatencyMon screenshots. Please note that the information in my tests often changes, for example, nvlddmkm.sys was a bigger culprit in last nights test than it was here, and the app that has the most frequent hard pagefaults changes from test to test. dxgkrnl.sys always shows up in my LatencyMon reports. wdf01000.sys is the latest culprit.

I notice that it says to disable CPU throttling, but I don't know where that is. My research hasn't led me to anything and I don't know why or if my CPU would be throttling. Also, it says my clock speed is incredibly low. That is not an accurate reading, I don't know what is causing that. 

Here are the solutions I've already explored: 

* Update BIOS
* Try other audio interface
* Try beta drivers for interface
* Check sample rate to make sure aligned in all settings
* Reinstall NVIDIA drivers
* Disable all network devices and update their drivers
* Check for viruses then remove anti-virus software.
* Update all drivers
* Adjust NVIDIA control panel settings
* Turn on all relevant high power settings
* Uninstall all other graphics or audio drivers on the system 

I have also relayed LatencyMon results to the interface manufacturer and /u/tomfocusrite and performed all tasks they've told me to try.

Thank you for all of your time that you contribute to my problem.

I will update this post as I troubleshoot, but I am at a complete loss. Any help is much appreciated, as I am at a loss.

&amp;#x200B;

**System Specifications:**

* CPU: Intel i3-4130 @ 3.40GHz
* GPU: AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB
* RAM: 16gb Corsair Vengeance DDR3
* Gaming Monitor: AOC CQ27G1 27"" Curved @ 2560x1440 144Hz
* Secondary Monitor HP E233 @ 1920 x 1080 60Hz

&amp;#x200B;

**Screen Flickers as if there is a faulty cable when playing the following games**:

* American Truck Simulator (Steam) 
* Hitman 2 (Steam)
* RDR2 (Rockstar Games Launcher)
* theHunter: Call of The Wild (Steam)

&amp;#x200B;

**No issues found in the following games:**

**Games Downloading for Testing:**

* Divinity: Original Sin 2 (GOG)
* WWE 2K20 (Steam)
* Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games Launcher)

&amp;#x200B;

**Troubleshooting done:**

* Swapped cables from DisplayPort to HDMI and back. Unplugged secondary monitor. No discernible difference.
* Ran ATS in OpenGL, Safe Mode, and Direct X. OpenGL provided best results. Still screen flickering, but less frequent. Not playable.
* Ran games in windowed/full screen. Ran games with full screen optimizations disabled. Disabled/enabled VSync. No discernible difference.
* Downloaded Windows Media Creation tool. Formatted HDD and SSD. Reinstalled windows fresh.
* Uninstalled GPU Drivers. Reinstalled.
* Installed monitor drivers after factory resetting monitor.
* Power cycled machine.

**Notes:**

* Screen doesn't flicker when doing anything outside of video games
* There was no flicker prior to the addition of a second monitor. Each of the games listed could run at or near max settings without issue.
* Audio, which is connected to the impacted monitor, cuts out in synchronization with screen flickering.
* I've had this computer and most of these games for a while now. This issue has never occured prior to the addition of the second monitor. Removing the second monitor does not seem to fix the issue, though.
* When launching games through Radeon Adrenalin, Radeon Adrenalin does not recognize any performance issues.
* Nothing seems wrong in Task Manager when the games are open.

fq2boo,MrBobDobolina,Netbook creates new folders and shortcuts while lid is closed overnight.,"I have an ASUS Netbook running Windows 10 Home.

Instead of turning it off, we just closed the lid. When I return, a week later, there are dozens of tabs open in the Edge browser. Many to random Amazon pages. Others to pages of search results for random items. We didn't think anyone was using it, so we ran some virus software (I think Malwarbytes, but not sure. Wasn't me.) Everything came back clean.

So we started shutting the computer down when we were done. Everything seemed normal.

Yesterday I brought the laptop home to do some testing. I forgot to turn it off, instead I closed the lid and set it on a shelf. This morning when I opened it up there were several windows open. Including Advanced Security Settings for Documents windows. The video folder properties window was open. There were 5 shortcuts on the desktop to the C Drive. There were 8 new folders inside the downloads folder. There were other various shortcuts. 

The timestamp on these folders was shortly before I went to bed, it wasn't me, and I live alone. The laptop was not connected to my network. It said no internet connection when I woke it up.

Per the instructions on this sub, I ran [rkill.com](https://rkill.com) and Malwarebytes with rootkit search and everything came back clean...

Any ideas what's going on? We've never seen anything like this.

The unit does have a touch screen... could the keyboard or maybe thermals from the unit be triggering random commands? 

The laptop only seems to do this when closed and left alone. when it's awake and we're working we don't have any issues.",4,1585333134,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fq2boo/netbook_creates_new_folders_and_shortcuts_while/,techsupport,1

8 GB RAM (not sure the specifics here but it's stock)

Everything is stock on the computer, not sure what the motherboard specifics are or anything else hardware related, sorry.


Over the last few weeks, my computer has been exhibiting some strange behavior. Here's a short list:


1. Google Chrome is extremely slow to load web pages. However, Firefox seems to be fine.


2. PDF files will not open in Adobe Acrobat. It only opens them as a background process but will not open the app. Each time I open it, a new background process is created.


3. PowerPoint will not open? It simply loads until I close out the loading screen, and then only runs as a background process. But Word is fine for some reason.


4. Whenever I shut down the computer, it just goes to a black screen but does not turn off unless I hold down the power button to manually boot it down. Once I reboot the computer, everything is fine until I close my laptop for the day (sleep mode) and wake it up the next day. I have to reboot every day essentially. Web pages run fine, PDFs open fine, etc. 


The timing of this is incredibly weird because they all popped up at the same time. I've had this laptop well over a year and everything was fine until now. I have a trial version of Malwarebytes premium (or pro or whatever) and it says everything is fine, no idea how valid that is though. I very rarely torrent on this computer so I don't think there would be some sort of weird virus issue. (Are viruses even a thing anymore? lol. It sounds so 2000s)

Hello there.

today i got my new components and installed everything right away. I've been doing this every now and then for years. My mainboard offered CPU PWR 2, but I only used th bsic PWR1+12PIN. So I turned on the computer for the first time. the cpu and gpu fan moved. However, I got no BIOS screen.

So I tried to turn off the pc with the button on the tower ... in vain. I held the button down for up to 30 seconds. the pc did not respond. the reset button does not work either. I then switched off the pc via the PSU switch, checked the mainboard connector (RESET SW, POWER SW) and tried again. PC turns on, not off. No BIOS.

Last I removed the GPU and tried again. The computer has not started since then. Probably the power supply is now defective. I smelled smoke. But that doesn't explain why the motherboard didn't respond in firsts place.

fq0xhr,SantaWantsYourSoil,Upgraded to new RAM but computer doesn't read both sticks.,"I recently decided to upgrade my memory from 2x4GB to 2x8GB. I purchased 2 sticks of 8gb Hyperx ram off of eBay to replace my current 2 sticks of 4gb Adata RAM. Once it arrived, I took out my old two sticks and put the two new ones in the same slot to be in Dual Channel Mode and attempted to boot up my PC but it didn't even get to the BIOS, it was just in an endless boot loop. According to the website for my B85-G41 Motherboard, the newly purchased RAM should be compatible because it's DDR3 and 1600MHz which is supported by the mobo.

I decided to test just one stick and when I did that, everything booted up perfectly and my computer recognized the one stick of new RAM. The problem occurs when I try to use two new sticks simultaneously. I don't think there's a mobo issue because the old two sticks work as they should and I never had any problems with my old RAM.

I did research online and checked forums for potential fixes and I feel stuck now and I'm not sure how to proceed.

-I updated my BIOS to the latest version and tried enabling XMP in the BIOS when one stick was in but still nothing. 

-I tried removing the CMOS battery and waiting 10 minutes to reset the BIOS, but that didn't help.

-I tried almost every combination with my 4 slots and 2 RAM and none seemed to work. There were also some slots where one stick wouldn't work but the other did leading me to think it might be faulty RAM but I'm not too sure. I bought new RAM off of Newegg that also seems to be compatible and I'm waiting for it to arrive but would like to know if there's an issue in case the Newegg RAM doesn't work either.

-I didn't check for bent pins in my CPU slot because my computer runs perfectly with the old RAM so I don't think there's an issue in that.

So I bought a brand new MacBook Pro 2019 13-inch at a electronic retail store in my country. After a few days the 'h' button broke somehow and I got the MacBook replaced today.

Power Cycle Count says 3. I can't for sure remember if I've had it plugged in two or three times.

The OS is MacOS Mojave and not Catalina. The original one I bought was with a pre-installed Catalina. So why isn't it already installed on the one I got this time?

Bonus: I've talked to customer support and I'm definitely entitled to have a brand new Mac. And even if I wasn't I would just go get my money back and go buy the computer at a different store.

fq0axc,HaveAGreatDecade,Insignia tv showing a still image of a screen from the past behind the current screen,"
I use the tv exclusively for Xbox and Playstation. This has been happening for 4 weeks. The first time I noticed it was when I unplugged the PS4 and plugged in my Xbox One. It showed the last image I had on my ps4 behind the xbox one screen. What happens is that after I stay on a screen for a long time, it stays in the background even when I switch to a different game. I am finding it very hard to describe this so I put an example below.



Example to explain what I mean: https://imgur.com/a/fTogQ1o

You can make put the title Night In the woods in the bottom middle of the screen, under the WZ. Incredibly sorry for having to take a picture of the tv, and I know it’s hard to see, but it wasn’t visible at all when I took an xbox screenshot.

2nd better example: https://imgur.com/a/eHGiVgT

3rd example after a YouTube video was left on pause for a long duration and the screen went dark, and I switched to a game: https://imgur.com/a/e52tE6X

I have said screen so many times and I know someone will probably say I sucked at describing it, but I really can’t figure out a better way to put it.

I’ve posted about this before, and I got a response last time that I thought had fixed it, but it’s still happening.

fq09c6,CreepyBlueBlob,apparently I'm running overclock on my processor?," Ok guys, I'll admit this first - I'm a total rookie when it comes to PC hardware and software as well.  


Long story short, I was playing The Witcher 3 on my PC for some time and it ran completely fine on medium-high settings, stopped playing for a week, came back, and suddenly the game is slow, clunky, stuttering, and takes much longer to react to my keyboard and mouse.  


Now, I tried playing with the graphic settings, tried rolling back the video card driver to the one i used when the game was fine, both, to no avail. So I concluded that it has nothing to do with my video card.  


I opened a thread on steam asking for help, and this guy started helping me, telling me to check if my CPU is overheating. I ran HWmonitor while nothing was open on the PC, and while playing the game. Here are the files I saved from HWmonitor: [https://filebin.net/la23gw0uq602sjop](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://filebin.net/la23gw0uq602sjop)  


The guy said that from what he can see, I'm running a 'big overclock' on it, so he told me to reset my BIOS settings to default, set the right memory settings, and then set my SSD as a boot option. I don't completely know if I did all of this correctly, but here are shots of the changes I did and the BIOS settings: [https://filebin.net/6cgfienw2isx7jn8](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://filebin.net/6cgfienw2isx7jn8)  


If I did it correctly, then it didn't work. I barely noticed any kind of change in the game, it was still running slow and clunky.  


I really don't know what to do next, I've a couple of other things I've seen on the internet, but they are didn't work as well. It will be a great help for me if one of you guys could review this thread and try to solve this problem.

I'm currently having some issues with CPU throttling when I am running newer games (Jedi: Fallen Order and Sekiro) on my machine. As soon as either game loads, my CPU drops down to \~2.7 GHz on all 4 cores and doesn't go back up to full speed until I've exited the game. I've checked temperatures using HWMonitor and Core Temp and the CPU doesn't seem to get any higher than \~40 C. Whenever I run a stress test using Prime95 the CPU gets up to the turbo speed of 3.8 GHz on all cores fine, and even idling the CPU remains at the base 3.5 GHz speed.

I've tried updating Windows 10, updating GPU drivers, dusting the components, and even reapplying thermal paste to the CPU and heatsink to make sure that it's not overheating. Has anyone got any ideas of what is going on, and how I can fix it?

Everything seems to be working fine, but all the visuals on my pc look... deep fried slightly, for lack of a better description.

Its not as crisp and HD as it should be. As if its slightly in the wrong resolution, but i have checked on windows, and through NVIDIA settings that it is on the right resolution (1920\*1080)

Games(RDR2) run fine, but still have the same visual look. almost like they have been put through a slight painting filter on photoshop.

I have unplugged my Video card and plugged the screen directly into the motherboard and had the same problem so i think it isnt my video card that is at fault.

I am using a HDMI cable to connect to my screen(i usually use dvi, so could it be that?) but i have tried another cable and it was the same.

This is a fresh windows install, and i have installed and reinstalled GFX Card drivers twice, though i have installed no other drivers..

fpzqet,Aht1,[Inconsistent] Left-click dragging sometimes randomly releasing,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

When i left-click drag stuff it sometimes randomly releases and auto clicks again. This problem happens often but not the whole time. It is not a hardware issue per se as the issue doesn't happen on other devices. It seems to be some compatibility issue/software issue in combination with my PC and the G903. Online I can't really find solutions apart from the ones mentioned below. What I should add is the fact that it seems to have some coherence with the speed I move my mouse. If I move very slowly it rarely happens, if I use my mouse normally or (for testing) very fast it happens much more frequent.

If you can't fully imagine what I mean here is an example: When I want to select a couple pictures and drag and drop them I can left-click (hold) to draw a border around those pictures. When my problem happens the left click suddenly releases and often even 'auto-clicks' again even tho I never released the button.

Mouse: G903

OS: Win10

Click-Lock: Never ever used

2. Using the same USB tethering with mobile data instead of wifi gives me a much more stable connection in game, implying that the hotel wifi is to blame, not the game's servers. (Unfortunately I have pay-as-you-go data, which makes just relying on mobile data too expensive to be a solution.)

3. The hotel does not have ethernet ports anywhere in the room. (I've checked--both by physically looking and by asking the front desk.)

4. The bandwidth seems reasonable enough for what *does* get through, as I've not had issues watching 1080p youtube videos or downloading multi-GB games/software.

I'm wondering if something like a high gain wifi antenna would potentially help, or if I'd just be getting a stronger connection to an equally unreliable network.

fpzcml,Procrastination_Guru,Power supply surges detected - Asus anti-surge shut down pc when in use,"Hi, 

Twice now my PC has completely shut down while in use and restarted with the message stating ""Power supply surges detected during the previous power on. Asus Anti-Surge was triggered to protect system from unstable power supply unit!"". 

&amp;nbsp;

The first time this happened was 2 days ago while playing Risk of Rain 2 the second was earlier today while I was using 3DS Max both of which I regularly do without facing any problems. I've seen threads suggesting that the cause may be a faulty power supply which may be the case as I've had this PC for 4 years now, however, without a power supply testing kit I can't be sure. I also read that it could be to do with the fans not properly cooling the parts though this has never been a problem before. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't want to jump the gun and buy a new power supply if that isn't what is causing the problem. Is there any way I could test what's causing this issues without needing to buy any external equipment? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

**Background Applications:** Steam or Battle net, Warzone or 3DMark, Radeon Software, GPU-Z

**Description of Original Problem:** My new GPU has been crashing and forcing me to have to hard restart my pc. At first I thought that it was a faulty GPU so I did an RMA and got it back, but the same issue occurred. The crash reliably occurs during COD Warzone and 3DMarks Fire Strike and Time Spy stress tests. There was one time I tweaked the settings and it didn't crash during Fire Strike, but I have not been able to repeat it. The last stress test I ran (Time Spy) crashed after 13 minutes and then I had an error saying that I had no AMD graphics drivers installed or they are not functioning properly; the screen also had several red glitches through out it.

**Troubleshooting:**

I have clean installed the drivers several times using DDU in safe mode, upgraded my operating system to Windows 10 with the latest updates, tweaked the settings in Radeon software following different guidelines:

1. Even though I scanned these files with bitdefender, malwarebytes, hitman pro and virustotal and they all said the files were clean,  is there any chance that they are still infected and could spread and infect other newer files that I have now?
2. Can these files infect external HDDs if I plug them in the computer?
3. Is it better to just delete the files altogether? These are not essential files, but it would take a good chunk of time to replace them accordingly.

fpygpz,almarcTheSun,"CPU at 100% (Windows 10), untrackable in Task Manager.","My CPU is always at a 100%. Idle, during heavy loads, it stays there. All 12 cores are at maximum utilization.

Would seem like an ordinary deal, I ran all the steps from the [Malware Removal Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide/) (Hitman included), found quite a few trojans and what not. Deleted them. But my CPU is still at a 100%.

What I mean by ""Untrackable"", is that the load is [spread out](https://i.imgur.com/jZIOOYB.png) across multiple running applications, and they rapidly switch places. Say, at one point, Brave is taking up 80%, two seconds later Brave is at 2% and the Steam Client is at 40%. The common theme is that no matter how many apps I terminate, the CPU utilization stays at a 100%. Always.

Also may be a useful detail, that when I kill all the heavy processes like Steam, Brave, NZXT/MSI software e.t.c., most often the WMI Provider Host jumps up in the list e.g. is supposedly using up 80% of the CPU. And generally, the WMI Provider Host is seen quite a lot on top of the list by CPU %. Still, not a single time the CPU utilization got down at least a single percent.

It might be malware, it might be some sort of a system error. But I also think that it might have to do with the power supply? Because, for some reason, even the lightest applications have ""Very High"" power usage.

my macbook screen is buggered so until a monitor arrives i am having to use my 42"" tv screen and sit very close to it. the only thing is it's so large it's giving me a headache. putting it further away doesn't improve the experience - what i'd like to do is use a smaller 'square' of the TV monitor. like using only the central 20"" of the 42"" screen.

the 'Underscan' slider under Display settings helps when sliding it to 'More' - as you can see from the black border in [ this image](https://i.imgur.com/orFAlmN.jpg). essentially i'd like to scale it down even more / further increase that black border.

is there any third party software that can help, or any other tricks that could help me out? i've tried the picture size settings on the tv but they are all to do with the resolution/ratio rather than size itself.

I live in a bigger house with a big family

So my aunt (my father's sister) has the internet (router etc) in her flat and we get 1 lan cable in our flat

This works ok most of the time


So now my problem:
I want to attach my Playstation or PC via cable to the internet rather than WLAN
Because its not stable (especially Playstation over WLAN)
Getting another lan-cable from the other flat seems not possible
So I'm stuck with the lan cable we already have in our flat
Our access point router doesn't have an outgoing lan port

So my question is
Is there a possibility to have WLAN AND LAN in my flat at the same time? 
All via this one lan/Ethernet cable? 

Do I need a special router or some kind of other device

fpxnty,bigjoe2019,Help please - router and / or pc hacked!,"Hi Everyone,

As the stereotypical family tech support, I manage my parents pc's remotely via AnyDesk whenever something stops working or when they have any issues / questions. This morning I received an urgent Skype call from my dad asking if I am messing around with my moms pc, because things don't look normal. Not thinking much of it, I connected via AnyDesk from my phone and saw someone furiously opening and closing webpages, and trying to whitelist / unblock a website through the ""HTTPS Anywhere"" extension which I have running on her firefox instance along one or two other recommended extensions.

I went into a flat panic and told them to pull the plug on the pc, got in front of my desktop, and asked them to power my moms back on. This is what I have found so far::

&amp;#x200B;

\- Firefox has no history of any sites being accessed.

\- I can't find a ""custom"" whitelist area for ""HTTPS Anywhere"".

\- AnyDesk shows no connections in it's history logs, online mine, before and after the incident.

\- RealVNC (which I run on the machine as a backup in case something goes wrong with AnyDesk), shows no recent connections. Note, RealVNC is locked down with an online account and 2FA.

&amp;#x200B;

I've loaded full fat McAfee (paid for), and run a full system scan, enabled local firewall etc, but it has come up empty. I suspect the system shutdown stopped the would be intruder before he did anything malicious to the machine. Now I started wondering how they may have gotten in, and upon spot checking the router I noticed a new port forward rule has been created, for AnyDesk, pointing directly at mum's internal IP. Image below:

[https://imgur.com/PtRrCd2](https://imgur.com/PtRrCd2)

I have now prevented connections to AnyDesk directly over port 7070 as this is a configurable option in the AnyDesk UI (and the default port by the looks of it). Now it looks like parents router is also being port scanned, although this may be standard behavior based on google searches...

[https://imgur.com/hsWFaOF](https://imgur.com/hsWFaOF)

I am really not sure how to plug this hole, and fear this may happen again any moment. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Couple things to note:

* The Unifi Video Controller is able to see the NAS and it is able to see the Ram Disk that I setup for the necessary buffer. It also built the initial folders in the Ram Disk and back when I first set everything up it was able to record on the NAS and it had created a handful of folders for some of the cameras' recordings.
* The Controller and the NAS are on the same network but different scopes and I can access the NAS directly within Windows Explorer on the server that houses the Controller.
* The Camera Controller is running on a Virtual Server with 16GB RAM.
* The NAS has \~27TB of storage with currently none of it being utilized (courtesy of the cameras not recording).

I got a dead GTX 580 from a friend that doesn't know anything about the card

Only information i got from him is that the card is dead and thats it

So i installed the card into my pc and it booted in safe mode

Windows didn't recognized the card and it had visual glitches

So i tried to try the oven trick. I dissassembled the card and put it in the oven at 200-250 Celcius for 12 minutes

After about 10 minutes i started hearing a sound like someone is making popcorn

Unfortunately after i take it from the oven the card lost all of its capacitors

I tried installing the card to my pc anyways and the windows recognized the card as GTX 580 and i installed the drivers for it but if i try to open a game the screen turns black and i hear a noise like jet taking off from the pc

So this was 5 months ago and i wanted to tinker with the card again

I installed it and try to monitor its temperature

Turns out the card is getting to 80-90 degrees Celcius in couple of seconds so i tried to underclock/undervolt it

I tested it in the unigine heaven benchmark and finally it finished the benchmark but i didnt tested any games that can test its power

So my question is can i use the card like this? Do i need to replace the capacitors? (I cant find any capacitors that  is the same the only ones  i found was from aliexpress and it didnt came) Why is my card getting so hot in just couple of seconds?

fpx5vm,Kamstkurf,Guide to no monitor signal during a pandemic,"I see there is a lot of similar posts about missing picture, specially during quarantine times. So I'm throwing together a simple monitor checklist i can link to whenever i need and at the same time maybe saving some new post-makers time. These are very often the solutions.

**Step one:**
* Restart computer. If you can't click 'turn off' due to no picture, hold on/off a few seconds.
* Check power cable, monitor cable and monitor source(usually a physical button)
* Run Windows update.
* Make sure you have the correct driver from the *manufacturers* website. Try both the latest and the 2nd latest.
* Trail and error. Replace what you have available while testing, one by one to find the source. Monitor, cable, port, graphics card. What makes sound, give off light or is completely dead etc?
* Make sure everything inside the computer is fastened correctly, there is little to no dust, fans are running and temperatures seem decent.
* Start is safe mode to check if problem is still present.
* Ask IT department at school/work/friend/family. Safe software for remote control, free for personal use: [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/).
* [/r/techsupport Malware guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/33evdi/suggested_reading_official_malware_removal_guide/).

**Jump to what relates to you:**

**Desktop with graphic card.**
Many desktops have internal graphic ports on the motherboard *and* a dedicated graphic card. If the graphic card's drivers are not installed correctly all the ports could stop sending picture. Remove the graphic card before you boot and use the motherboard port to install the drivers.

**Monitor with adapters**(vga-hdmi etc.).
There are active and passive adapters. With active the data is being processed in the adapter while with passive the monitor has to be able to do the work. Not all monitors support passive adapters.

**No signal to other devices** like USB keyboard and mouse.
* Update *all* these drivers from the *manufacturers* website: USB driver, Chipset and graphic card.
* Update Bios.
* Could be related to power consumption. Check power settings, specially 'selective usb', Try lowering amount of devices or replace the Power Supply Unit(PSU).

**Laptop with docking**
* Often the docking needs more power than the laptop, specially to serve two or more monitors. Check the v/a watt on both docking and charger. Example: 19.5v/6.7a
* Check if the docking have numbered monitor slots, you may not be able to use all at once or with the current combination.

**Two or more monitors**
* Can't reach a window on the good monitor because it's on a monitor that's not on: `Alt`+`tab` to make wanted window active. `Shift`+`win-key`+`arrow-key` to move window to next monitor.
* Mouse don't go to next screen or monitors is the wrong side: Right click your desktop background and enter monitor settings, here you can identify what monitor is what by number and simply click and drag in order. Remember to save the new settings.

**Other graphic related problems**
* | Reinstall/Update/Repair[Visual C](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) | Reinstall/Update/Repair[DirectX](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx) |
* Reinstall whatever software you are having problem with.
* Try launching with or without 'as administrator'.
* Temporarily deactivate antivirus software to see if it makes any differences.
* Picture is rotated: `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Arrow-keys` to rotate. On some hardware this don't work and you have to rotate in Display settings. 
* After everything else, but before hardware changes: Reinstall Windows.

* Small dots on monitor: Dead pixels. Return to shop if within warranty and above 5 dots. If not you could carefully tap them and hope for a resurrection.
* Dark or light spots: If Laptop, often pressure damage — if Desktop often fluid damage.
* Dark or no picture on Laptop: Could be defective backlight, replaceable. Do you see anything if using a flashlight while it's on?
* Colors or cracks on monitor: Probably broken glass/panel. See if your travel or home insurance cover some or all of it. Replacement often 50-300usd.
* Stripe on monitor: Sometimes you could tell it's hardware or software related if it's vertical or horizontal but the better solution would be to check if cable is not damaged and tighten correctly. Then try connect another monitor to see if it have the same problem(if not the problem is probably on the first monitor).

**port/cable of choice**
* 1 — HDMI or DisplayPort (HDMI is what you often have to the TV, Displayport is similar but only have one ""sawed off corner"") — Also transmit sound.
* 2 — DVI (white, similar to the blue vga but larger. Keep in mind DVI-I only fit DVI-I, while DVI-D fits both) — Does not transmit sound.
* 3 — VGA (blue) — Does not transmit sound.

There's also variations of mini, micro, thunderbolt and so on. They are all good choices. [See picture](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Ff%2Ffb%2FCommon_Display_Interfaces.png&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1).

**I messed up**
Start over. Here's how you can [download and create a bootable USB](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) to reinstall Windows 10, if you already had Windows 10 it shouldn't require an activation key.

**What now?**
If you are sure you went through *everything* here and you are no closer to isolating or solving your problem i would suggest you bring the computer to a technician when possible.

Remember a lot of online stores are still open and could send products to your home. Choose known ones like Ebay, Amazon etc.

You can still report warranty/RMA to shops online or directly to the manufacturer.

I have a 1.5 TB external USB HD that I purchased \~6 years ago. I'm currently playing movies I'd had stored on it, but the drive is very slow. It takes a long time to load up all of my movies in the Mac finder window (while the drive makes a considerable amount of noise working), and whenever I pause a movie and restart it, the movie stutters for 2-3 seconds before starting playback.

today while i was trying to figure out potential problems, i started getting the ""Select to choose what to do on a removable disk"" notification on my D drive even though it's not a removable drive, if i had the drive folder open it would close by itself and give me this notification, which won't let me access the D folder, then after 30 seconds it would let me access it again.

so currently i have no idea if my hard drive is dying, or if it needs manual adjustment, or if it's a virus.

fpwfn9,kylekornkven,Cloned drive trouble,"TL/DR: Cloned a Windows 10 Pro drive to put in a new machine that was purchased with Win 10 home.  Can I just buy the upgrade key?


So a month ago, a client of mine had me get him a new computer.  He then wanted me to repurpose his old computer for someone else in the office.  I told him it wasn't a good idea, but we proceeded anyways.  I bought a windows 10 pro key to upgrade the old machine and got everything set up.  

Turns out I was right and how we got the second person a new computer to replace the used one.  Instead of going through all the time to reinstall all of his programs, I decided to clone his drive and put it in the new machine.  Everything worked, except activation.  It says it cannot activate because it is 10 pro and supposed to be 10 home.

My question is, is there a way to set things up so that the TV feedback doesn't happen, while still being able to chat and talk to one another during the show? Are there some settings I could change? Or maybe a certain phone positioning/angle/barrier that would help?

Would turning down my TV volume and their TV volume help?

I have no idea what it is! Earlier this week I started to question what it actually is but just left it. Today I looked online and people were talking about ""clicking"" noises of navigating around folders, which is not the noise I hear.

I can only describe it as like a low quality 'dft' or a really fast [it just went off again lol] click, lasting less than half a second. My system sounds are off because I have a usb noise that pings a lot, but the only applications open in the volume mixer is my headset, Firefox and Chrome. I feel like it could be firefox but I'm not sure why it would make the noise. The tabs I have [just made the noise again, that time the volume mixer did not highlight any colour, so I don't believe that they are the source.] are youtube, reddit and a pdf document.

Hi guys and gals, I’m not a tech savvy by any means that’s why I’m asking for your help. As of late, I have been having issues with my my mouse freezing every couple of seconds. I tried everything I could but no solution. And then a thread showed up which suggested to update the chipset driver and that’s what I did but that’s where the problem starts. I went to the motherboard’s BIOS and I clicked on the M-flash option. I waited ten minutes and nothing was popping up. I didn’t ask me to proceed with the installation of anything for that matter. My monitor went dark and my pc still continued running. I panicked and here is where I screwed up as I decided to switch off the PC. I tried different solutions to get my monitor to recognise my PC by turning off the pc completely, I removed the CMOS battery briefly but no results. I don’t think I have bricked the motherboard as I only clicked on the M-flash drive and nothing more.

I am sure its a software fault and can be fixed as it was working fine before the update, 

 Here is what i tried:  


* Used DDU to remove all drivers from safe mode and installed drivers from NVIDIA 381-442 none worked
* Reinstalled windows 10 and repeated step 1
* Installed windows 7 and repeated step 1
* My monitor still shows generic pnp in device manager, but i still went ahead and dumped my EDID from linux
   * Compared the dump with registry edid and a working lcd dump i found on the internet, the edid seems fine to me but you can check the files i maybe wrong, i am no expert. (I found on the internet that an update caused some corrupted LCD EDIDs which stopped the graphics driver, i guess this is not my case)
* Access card with nvflash and i can read the serial number etc, i even flashed a new firmware successfully then downgraded, so nvflash can easily access the card
   * Nvflash prints blank on IRF subsystem section and inforom section
* GPU-Z shows ""unknown"" in some areas but i guess thats because the drivers arnt loaded 
   * When i install new drivers gpu-z shows the bios version and other relevant information until a restart
* Reflashed motherboard bios
* EC wiped the motherboard (CMOS HARDRESET)
* Switched to legacy, Uefi and uefi with csm mode, none made a difference

I knew there was a problem inside so I opened it and check. All components work okay. So I just cleaned my fans and remove the CMOS battery for 30 seconds according to what I search online. I put them back together and proceed to turn it on. The good news is. The computer works well. I can hear the fans. The lights go on which is a relief. The bad news are the Monitor, keyboard, and mouse doesn’t work. The monitor doesn’t pick any signal and display a black screen. The mouse and keyboard are not lighting up so I knew something’s wrong. I remove the plugs and check again inside. Everything is ok so I put it back. I properly plug back all the components behind and turn it on.

It's an Acer aspire, it has a touchscreen. The touchscreen is cracked and therefor registers a touch all the time. I have disabled the 'hid-compliant touch screen' multiple times, but every time it does an update, and sometimes seemingly at random, it reactivates it.

It wouldn't be so bad but because it's registering touches in have to press the screen rather hard to use my mouse to get into device manager, not always the exact same spot, or same amount of pressure, usually takes about 5 minutes to find the correct spot/pressure that minimizes the false touches, and then another 5 to actually open/disable the device.

Yes replacing the screen would ultimately solve the issue but it's just a junk laptop I use for screwing around so not interested in spending any money on it.

My initial idea was to create an web form based html document that they keep on the desktop that has a default format so they can only enter in predefined areas, or this may be something easily done with a programming language like jQuery?

fpv2au,AvatarIII,Is it worth upgrading a cPU in a 10+ year old laptop?,"So I have an old Toshiba Satellite L300D-243 which I have been upgrading, I have upgraded it to Windows 10 64bit and put in 8GB of DDR2-800 RAM, replacing the original 3GB of DDR2-667, I have put in an SSD, and it's running better, but it still overheats sometimes.

I was looking into cleaning out the CPU fan or reapplying the thermal paste, however accessing the CPU is [quite awkward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybhGbX6xaMc) so I figured at that point, why not upgrade the CPU?

It currently has an [AMD Athlon X2 QL-64](http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Athlon%2064%20X2%20QL-64%20-%20AMQL64DAM22GG.html) (2.1GHz Dual Core). The best CPU for the socket (s1g2) that exists is the [Turion Ultra X2 ZM-88](http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Turion%20X2%20Ultra%20ZM-88%20-%20TMZM88DAM23GG.html) (2.5GHz Dual Core) but I cannot find any anywhere, but I found a cheap [ZM-87](http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/K8/AMD-Turion%20X2%20Ultra%20ZM-87%20-%20TMZM87DAM23GG.html) (2.4GHz Dual Core) which according to benchmarks is [over 30% better](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare/AMD-Athlon-64-X2-QL-64-vs-AMD-Turion-X2-Ultra-Dual-Core-Mobile-ZM-87/45vs495)! Which seems a decent improvement to me, but my issue isn't necessarily speed, because the 2.1GHz is good enough for what I use the laptop for (classic gaming, word processing, web surfing), but would the faster CPU run cooler with the same applications? What if I were to underclock the Turion to 2.1GHz?

The question is, is it worth tearing down the whole laptop to get to the CPU, or should I just use compressed air to clean the fan as much as possible without tearing the whole laptop down?",16,1585307194,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpv2au/is_it_worth_upgrading_a_cpu_in_a_10_year_old/,techsupport,1

After swapping the old GPU for the new one and installing the 6-pin power connector the PC booted normally, the GPU was recognized and the new drivers were installed. I tested the GPU in Apex legends and everything was working as expected. The game ran smoothly on the highest settings. 

This morning however, I turned on my PC and did not get any output on my monitor, just a black screen. When plugging in the HDMI cable in the motherboard instead of the GPU, I do get an output. 

As for troubleshooting: In device manager the GPU is not showing up anymore, the fans are still running on the card. Yesterday I restarted the PC two or three times after installation and the card was recognized normally. 

Any idea's as to what might be causing this issue?

The PSU recommendation for this new card is a 350W PSU, could it be that my PSU isn't powerful enough to power the card?

&amp;#x200B;

Link/Register Mobile Number with Aadhar Card Online | Link Your Aadhaar Card With Mobile Number

&amp;#x200B;

The government has made it mandatory to link Aadhaar with a number of documents and financial instruments making Aadhar card as one of the most preferred proof of identity. In case you do not have Aadhaar, you can apply for an Aadhar card and get your mobile number registered in Aadhar card during the enrolment process. Once Aadhaar is linked with these instruments, the government starts transferring subsidies under various schemes such as DBT, Pahal, etc. directly in the bank account of the beneficiary and a confirmation message is sent to the registered mobile number. In case your mobile number is not registered with Aadhaar, you will not receive any such messages and will not be able to track the benefits that you are eligible to receive.

&amp;#x200B;

Steps to Register Your Mobile Number with Aadhar Card

There was an online facility for registering mobile number in Aadhaar through the SSUP. But as of now, the facility has been discontinued and the applicant has to visit the Aadhaar Enrolment/Update centre to register/update mobile number in Aadhaar. The process takes up to 90 days for updation. Here’s what you need to do to register your mobile number in Aadhaar:

&amp;#x200B;

Step 1: Visit the Aadhar Enrolment/Update Centre

Step 2: Fill the Aadhaar Correction Form

Step 3: Mention your current mobile number that has to be updated in Aadhaar

Step 4: Submit the form and provide your biometrics for authentication

Step 5: The executive hands over the acknowledgement slip to you

Step 6: The slip contains an Update Request Number (URN)

Step 7: The URN can be used to track the status of Aadhaar updation

fpumok,DementorAsMyPatronus,Trying to fix the screen on an HP Pavilion.,"I am trying to fix an HP Pavilion. There is no data that I need to save, and I'm comfortable soldering, so I'm flexible on solutions.

The screen stopped showing anything but the backlighting still lights up. I tried hooking up an exterior monitor. That displayed normally as if the only connected monitor, so I decided the problem was the original screen. I ordered and installed a new screen. (This meant unscrewing the lid, separating the two exterior plastic casings of the lid, swapping the inner plasma display, re-attaching the input ribbon, and re-assembling.) The new screen does not display anything either, behaving just like the one that I thought had stopped working.

I'd like a rundown of possible causes, and as many solutions as you can think of.",4,1585304851,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpumok/trying_to_fix_the_screen_on_an_hp_pavilion/,techsupport,1

I have tried running Malware bytes and it finds nothing.

fpuid5,cardstone10,Problem with the latest Windows 10 update (stuck in welcome screen),"Hi so I've been having trouble with the latest update, basically I'm stuck in the login screen. First after the update I got stuck at 100% on the blue screen. After forcing a shutdown, I get to the login screen but after logging in I get stuck in the welcome screen. I don't know what the exact update is since I don't know if I can see it from somewhere.


Previously I have fixed this by uninstalling the latest quality update, but today I used System Restore to restore a point I created before the update, seems like this screwed something up.

Now when I attempt to uninstall the latest quality update I am told ""We couldn't find the latest quality update to uninstall"". Trying to uninstall the latest feature update gives the message ""We ran into a problem and won't be able to uninstall the latest feature update of Windows. Try resetting your PC instead (Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC).


Startup repair didn't work either.


Trying to boot to safe mode doesn't work, it gets stuck in the welcome screen just the same.


As for the command prompt command that I've tried: 

sfc /scannow says ""Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation""

bootrec /fixmbr says The operation completed successfully""

bootrec /fixboot says ""Access in denied""

bootrec /scanos says ""Total identified Windows installations: 0. The operation completed successfully""

bootrec /rebuildbcd says the same as above.

None of the commands had any effect.


I tried to unplug my mouse and keyboard (at the same time after getting stuck, and only plugging mouse when rebooting and same with only the keyboard, I don't suppose you can enter the password with both unplugged) this didn't work either

fpugbz,Bradley_McAulay98,Samsung M3 USB External Hard drive does not appear in Windows 10.,"This used to work just fine, for years, until recently i realised it was nowhere to be seen on file explorer, it used to be under the E: Drive, however, this location no longer exists for some reason. 

The device **appears in Device Manager** under disk drives, however, it does not appear in Disk Management. I've followed most solutions on Windows Support but they all seem to be the same, ""set up new root on disk management"" etc, none of which seem to be offering a solution for me. I dont understand how the device can function amazingly for a long time then just appear. It is a 1TB Ext HD and has around 931GB remaining in space, so i am hopeful my content is still on there, if there is anyway to recover the content please tell me, as thats all i really care about. 

If anyone can advise whats wrong or offer me a solution i would be very grateful, this external hard drive has lots of pictures from throughout the years.

fpufrp,chrisname,Copied an old version of a VeraCrypt/TrueCrypt volume on top of a newer version of the volume in Windows Explorer in Windows 10,"I had a VeraCrypt volume in directory A. I copied the volume to directory B, then modified the version in directory A, and copied the version from directory B back to directory A, meaning the modifications to version A were lost.

I did all of this using Explorer which makes me think there is some hope that the data hasn't been overwritten. I see two possibilities:

1. Explorer copied the file to newly allocated sectors and then just changed the directory entries &amp; file table, in which case the old data is there in unallocated blocks.

2. Alternatively, it might have noticed that the files had the same name and size and just written the new data over the old blocks, in which case I'm screwed.

The data was important and I didn't save it anywhere else so I'm quite desparate to find it.

I've created a PhotoRec signature from the new version and PhotoRec can find a matching file in the unallocated space, and creates the file in the recovery location, but it says that there isn't enough disk space and never writes any data to the file. This happens no matter what location I choose, all of them having tens or hundreds of GB while the volume was 1 GB. The filesystems are all NTFS.

fpubz3,metachen41,Samsung Galaxy S8 suddenly died.,"Hey there.

First of all thanks for any help I'll receive.
This morning i got woken up by my phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) as usually. Turned off the alarm and went back to sleep for about 20 minutes. As i got up I looked at my phone and just saw the LED flashing in blue 3 to 5 times. After that my phone completely died. I won't get a charge notification if i plug in my power cable, neither do any reset/restart button combination, e.g. power and volDown, I could find work.

There are some physical scratches on the surface. But they are relatively old and the phone did work great before. Could overheating be a cause? Because it may be that I somehow slipped the phone beneath my pillow while asleep.

However I'm kinda desperate right now as finding a replace phone or a repair service in times like these could be difficult.

So I put the phone to rest for some time now and afterwards I'll try again. Does anyone have a clue or can give advice what else can be done. I appreciate any help I get.",5,1585303277,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpubz3/samsung_galaxy_s8_suddenly_died/,techsupport,1

However My monitor, keyboard and mouse still didn't work and I found out one of the memory cards was broken. So I removed it and now the computer works fine again (with half of RAM left).

However, I am still a bit concerned because of the behavior of the powerbutton before. I tried to put it back into the same socket again, and it still behaves normal (also my tv and speakers or connected to that socket, and they did not turn on and off.) I will put it back into the normal power socket though. But I was wondering if this could have been the reason for the RAM to break?

As of the last week, playing any game will cause this issue withen 5mins and just idling or utubing will cause it but it can be anywhere between 30mins - 3hours...

any advice would be appreciated",2,1585300604,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fptvju/computer_dies_alot/,techsupport,1

I am having real issues syncing photos to Google Drive (around 10,000). I first realised there was a problem when my computer suddenly shut off twice in one day while trying to sync/upload these photos. I then checked the task manager to see what the issue was and the power usage said 'Very High', so it makes sense why my laptop could not cope (and continues to do this when I try to sync). Also my laptop is a fairly decent laptop with an 8th gen i7, 8gb ram, etc.

I've set the sleep settings on all of them to ""Never"" and have drilled down further into advanced sleep settings and everything checks out. Maintenance are adamant the office has no eco power settings and power shouldn't go down, which I believe because SOME PCs have stayed powered on.

I've had no luck with any Google results, and am now starting to think it may be BIOS related, but am unsure as to where to look for power settings within the BIOS?

fpssvm,ST_1983,USA Samsung laptop not charging in India," 

Hello, 

When I was in USA I had a Samsung laptop which had a lot of wear and tear. I moved to India last year and continued to use my Samsung laptop with a power adapter. Some problem seemed to creep up with the charger/power cord of my Samsung laptiop as it began to charge only when held at a certain angle. I quickly transferred my data to a Dell laptop (bought in the middle east, I also use it with a power adapter in India) through Google drive. Eventually, the American Samsung laptop stopped charging altogether, presumably because the charger/power cord stopped working.  

I just discovered that I did not transfer an important file from my old Samsung computer (which does not charge anymore) to my new Dell computer. What can I do to get my old American Samsung computer working in India? Is there a chance that I could buy a charger for my American Samsung laptop in India? If not, is it possible to transfer files from my old laptop to new without the old computer switching on?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I've had my Dell G5 for about seven months now. I use it for work and of course games, and things have been going smoothly till about a few months ago.

I reset Windows originally 3 months ago after I realized I had installed too much non-virus crap. That fixed performance, but since then I have reset Windows 15 or so times as a few weeks or even days after a reset my performance will dip.

I keep most Windows and nVidia settings to their defaults, and delete all of the usual Dell and Windows bloatware. Drivers are updated, and only a few basic applications are installed.

I install Steam games to secondary, completely empty D drive. 

After about 3 or so installed games my performance will suffer on all of them. Constant stutters, lag etc. when bechmark videos with the exact laptop having much better results.

fps55r,Overclockworked,Mechanical Keyboard Specific Key Malfunctions,"Hi,

So my Logitech G910 Orion Spectrum RGB keyboard seems to have some broken keys suddenly and randomly, I'd love some help figuring it out.

Specs

* Windows 7 Home Premium (6.2.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601)
* 8 GB RAM, i3-2200 CPU, x64 bit
* Logitech G Hub version 2020.1.31155

I was just earlier writing some stuff, did a rather long voice call, and noticed at the end of it that some of the keys on the left hand side of my keyboard are working rather strangely.

Physical Condition

* The keyboard is 3 months old, bought during christmas
* There was no major spillage on the keyboard like water.
* Though I admit a small amount of spit/phlegm got on that area like 4-5 days ago while i was less than sober.  I cleaned up the surface with a q-tip at the time, and just now cleaned the residue that went between the keys.  I didn't notice anything gooey between the keycaps and switches when I pried them off.

&amp;#x200B;

**ISSUE DESCRIPTION**

The problem is hard to explain because it seems to have changed a bit as I've troubleshooted.  But essentially I get mixed up keys

**D** becomes **DX,** or a few times it'd copy paste the system time, and sometimes it'd just be **X**

**C** posts **X**

I've gotten a few symbols even when I type.

Sometimes when I click on any text field it will spam ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd until I close out.

When I took the keys off I stopped having issues with certain keys like Z, F, W, etc... But I definitely still had problems with the D / X / C area specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

I noticed my G Hub was corrupted, so I replaced it.

* Went into safe mode and recycled the folder, then remove from recycle bin too.
* I was told to remove keyboard drivers but all I found after deleting the file was 3 HID Keyboard devices, none of which were logitech.  I left them alone.
* I restarted, then installed the new version of G-Hub with my keyboard unplugged
* Rebooted with keyboard plugged in.
* I did notice then that I had the Logitech HID Keyboard as a 4th option, so I deleted and reinstalled that driver after the whole process.  

This fixed nothing.  

I pried the key caps off every problem key in the area and cleaned it with Q-tips, nothing but a bit of hair and some of the mentioned drunk-residue between keys.

I intended to take care of this keyboard so I will be rather upset if my first mistake busted it like this, especially considering how filthy this current backup keyboard is.  My understanding is that if my spit broke these switches I'll have to do soldering work to replace them?

I bought a pre built gaming pc some years ago. 

Over time I’ve had a few issues with the firmware it boots through (might be putting it wrong, sorry), UEFI, as it seems to not wanna let me issue some of the normal functions I would be allowed with BIOS. 
It has now gotten to a point where my pc will freeze a couple minutes after launch, and will only turn off manually (holding the power button down). I thought to myself that I should probably try and download the windows update I’ve been getting notifications about, but it won’t let me as I get a few different error codes in regards to these different updates respectively. 
Then I went ahead and tried a clean wipe / reset of windows but that fails as well. 

I also have had other issues that I’ve just had to content with over time, a primary one being that I cannot access a lot of functions of the pc: cannot open properties on any program nor administrate stuff like playback and microphone devices. 

Ultimately I would like to just wipe the pc, as it is probably quite needed.

I have a HP Specter that I use for gaming. I also have an external graphics card -- a Nvidia GTX 970 -- that I plug into it so I can run higher-end games. Up until recently, the setup worked great -- I could just plug in the card, hit the ""on"" switch, and boot up any game I liked. I didn't even need to restart my laptop.

Then two things happened, and I'm guessing the issue is due to one of them, but I don't know which one or why:

1. I shipped my graphics card cross-country (in its case, in a box with lots of bubble wrap).
2. I uninstalled my Nvidia drivers and installed new ones.

Now whenever I plug in my graphics card, I get a ""code 43"" error and it tells me the drivers aren't working. At this point I've uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers several times (including using a DDU); I've tried installing an older version, from about a year ago; I've followed a tutorial on how to download drivers without the GeForce Experience app; I've tried plugging in the card before, during, and after startup; I've even reset my Windows software to the state it was a couple weeks ago. Nothing has worked.

It could be the hardware itself got damaged during shipping, but the card is pretty durable and the shippers insulated it pretty well. (Plus the computer tells me it's a software issue.) But if the issue really *is* with the drivers, I don't know what else to do, except maybe sacrifice a goat to whatever's possessing them.

I'm a total noob to building computers so I followed a YouTube tutorial online to build it for the most part, supplementing with the short tutorials provided by the motherboard manual. I finish the build, plug in the PSU to an outlet, turn it on. 

[Here's a video of what happens when I do. ](https://youtu.be/AsxVTGgyHck) Yes my voice is super weird and my cable management sucks, but bear with me here. According to the motherboard manual, the debug LED lights flash red because the motherboard does not recognize a certain component. 

When I first turned it on the issue was DRAM. So I reinstalled the RAM in more firmly and in the correct slots for dual channel support. No issue afterwards. Now, it's the CPU and GPU (the led light for VGA apparently means the GPU isn't working.) and BOOT1?

I have reinstalled the CPU three times. I checked for bent pins, residual thermal paste, hair, what have you. I made sure the triangles aligned and it was secure. That the plastic covering for the socket was removed. Nada. Installed the heat sink securely on top, no dice. Unplugged and replugged the cable for the CPU to the PSU? Nope. It's all wrong!

As for the GPU, I've unplugged the 8-pin connector that connects the GPU to the PSU. As far as I know it needs only one cable. It's in the first PCIE slot, secure, screwed in, yet the Motherboard still doesn't recognize it. 

I've gone out of my way to make sure everything is plugged in securely, neatly, and all the way in. To my knowledge all the cables are in the correct place (but please pardon me if I'm wrong). I've honed down the issue to the CPU and the GPU, and would really appreciate any advice I can get. 

I've also tried plugging the computer directly into an outlet instead of an extension cord. Nope. My tech-savvy friends are kind of scratching their heads so I'd really appreciate any help on this.

How should I go about the clonning process? A step by step solution would be greatly aprecciated. I have a 1TB Hard Drive since late 2013 that I have never restored and I plan on buying a Kingston 480 GB SSD. I would also want to use the old HDD as storage. How would I go about that? Will I have to wipe it clean? If so, how?

I made a post a day ago about my computer not starting right, it had a weird pop up that someone told me meant it was trying to boot from an up address or something? They told me to get into the bios option screen, but neither of the keys that are supposed to work for my computer are working. Anyways I’ve been messing around with it a bit, And I tried to make a window recovery USB, but it’s not helping. The only screen I can get to is the boot manager, and when I select the USB it goes to a screen that black with one line in the top left corner, like it’s saying for me input something. However, I can’t type in it, and nothing I’ve found says I should be able to. I managed to get to the windows troubleshooting menu once, but none of the options there were working (ex the start up repair one said it couldn’t fix it). It didn’t have the factory reset option that it usually has either. I’m not really sure what to do from here, I feel like I’ve gone through all my options. If this were an older computer I’d think that this might be it for the computer, but I got it 2 or 3 months ago, and i was told that since it’s a gaming laptop (Lenovo legion) it could handle pretty much anything. I’m at a loss, so any ideas would  awesome. Feel free to ask for more info, I’m not really sure what kind of stuff is usually helpful here.

fpptzr,PrideoftheAllFather,"Trying to get docs off of my old computer, infected with presumed virus and it's barely able to function.","I've been wanting to get these documents off of a ""childhood"" computer for years, but only recently found my old desktop computer. (I found it today) 

It's an HP a6700y that we bought many years ago, and I'm unable to tell if it is using Windows Vista or if we ever had anything else. I'd truly love to tell you more, but, when I first plugged it in, I didn't hit the ""start windows normally"", but the other option, which was along the lines of system repair or maybe that was what it said. I, foolishly, thought I'd have that repair done, I could open Microsoft word, put the files I wanted onto a flashdrive, then transfer them to my laptop. 

It's.. not frozen? But it's soooooo slow. I can only imagine it would be, especially after being off and unplugged for over 5 years, but this popup is appearing all the time. It says

""PlayPickle32.exe cant start because playpicklelib32.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix the problem.""

I looked it up and it seems from Microsoft's forum that I can download something and get rid of it, but.... I can't even get task manager to run. It was on for about 30 minutes, and I think managed to close one thing, but now task manager has left me for some reason after my screen went black and I'm left with a screen that shows everything not even half loaded in the bottom bar, just partial loading in icons, and that stupid popup in the middle of my screen. 

I can move my mouse, I can seemingly click, but nothing is ever happening, even if I wait 30 minutes between clicks. I've been working on this for hours, but to no avail it seems. I've left it on for a good hour plus now without me doing anything but moving the mouse so it doesn't sleep. 

What can I do to remove this virus if my computer won't let me open anything nor close any of the pre-existing nonresponsive programs? 

I've contemplated using my old laptop as a ferry between this desktop and my new laptop; I'd transfer the files onto a flashdrive, transfer them to the old laptop, clean the old laptop, then transfer things safely to my current laptop, but I can't even get to Microsoft word. It's loaded up, but it switches between not responding and responding continuously behind the popup of the pickle extension error. 

I'll provide any other info I can, but I'm really quite unsure since I haven't used this computer since I was a teenager. Thank you so much for any help. I'm really racking my brain and I'm willing to be patient, but it's bedtime soon so eventually this thing will need to shutdown or sleep, (I Don't even know which one is better for the night), and I don't know if tomorrow will be more of the same. 

Is there *any* hope for me to get these word documents?",2,1585279779,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpptzr/trying_to_get_docs_off_of_my_old_computer/,techsupport,1

When playing games like Apex Legends, Fallout 4, Siege, etc. I get random crashes and cannot seem to find the issue. I can lower my graphics settings and play games in a more stable state that way but it's honestly disappointing to play in 1080p on low settings when I know my setup can handle much more than that. I updated my drivers to the latest version through GeForce Experience to Version: 445.75. I've also tried using Ryzen Master to change to the amount of active cores to 6 through ""game mode"", with no avail. If I watch task manager, there isn't much of an indication on what, if anything, is being overloaded. Yet I still had Fallout 4 crash on me when playing windowed at 1440p on high settings. Someone has recommended doing a bios update on the motherboard, though I am unfamiliar with doing this and I cannot find much help online for the X399 chipset. I have installed the bios update .zip file from Gigabyte but I do not know where to go from there.

Well recently, Windows completely stopped wanting to connect to my WiFi, while it still worked fine on Linux. So I just said fuck it and decided to switch to Linux fully. Which was a mistake, because i quickly realized I was unable to get things like Wine working so I could use windows programs, mostly my graphics tablet (which I did get working, i just cant get used to art programs on linux like Krita now) and clip studio paint. I figured I could just use a Windows VM, but it ended up running so slowly that I knew I wouldn't be able to actually get anything done on it.

So now I decided to just put windows back again as a dual boot. I have unallocated space to use as a partition (outside of the extended partition Linux is in), but whenever i use a flash drive with the windows 10 iso contents to boot from, I get ""Selected boot device not available"" with options to retry. Checked with multiple flash drives and different windows 10 ISO's (64 bit and 32 bit), both official downloads from Microsoft.

Anyone know how I can fix this?

I've taken the bottom off and looked around as best I could. Everything seems in place. No bad soldering as far as I can tell, no loose connections, nothing. I've followed support's instructions and manually reset it using a switch of some sort on the bottom, holding it down for five seconds before trying to reboot again. Nothing has changed, even doing that with and without wall power.

I have since removed the CMOS battery thinking that was an issue, but no dice. The battery is also removed as of late to see if the laptop has issues with dead batteries, but nothing still.

It seems to be worse at night and I already emailed epic games (the creator of fortnite) and they assured me that it is on my end.

Anyone have any experience with this ? The weird thing is my internet cord has always been like this but I only recently started having issues. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

This has happened many times before, but it usually works fine after I warm it up a little, which didn't seem to fix it this time.

So naturally, I looked up how to fix this issue and have tried everything. From soft resetting, to hard resetting (keep in mind this laptop has a non removable battery), to trying to reset the bios, to hooking up to an external monitor, reseating the memory modules, unplugging and plugging back in the hard drive, basically everything listed on the HP site. I have spilled drinks on the laptop on numerous occasions so it doesn't surprise me that would have an effect on it at some point.

I'm considering taking it in to get serviced as this was an $1100 laptop but was wondering if they'll care if it's tampered with.

fpoqtt,FantasyForeigner,Strange sounds from the front of my computer,"Hello guys and gals,

I've spent about 1500$ on a new PC build right before New Year 2020, and I've tried to buy quality parts, but it seems like something is wrong with my PC ever since. There is a cricket-like clicking noise that comes from the front or the middle of my computer, as far as I can tell, and while it's not constant, it's probably there for like 50% of the time the computer is on, clicking every 5-10-30 seconds, a minute etc. the interval varies, it's usually about 5-10 seconds between the sound re-appears. I haven't brought it to the repair guy yet, because of other non-PC related stuff that got in the way, and I'm planning on bringing it for a look in the coming week, but I'd like to know what the potential problem might be earlier, just to prepare myself as to how to deal with the potential delay with the repair, since I'm using the computer for 8-12 hours of my work from home needs every single day.

I've tried to capture the problem on sounds, it's not easy, because the sound isn't always there, and for some reason it tends to dissapear exactly in the times when my mic is plugged in and ready to record... yeah, tell me about it.

Track 1 is the one from today, I've managed to capture 3 repeats of the sound in real time, I haven't edited their frequency.
https://youtu.be/ih7xQXHqoyA

Track 2 is from a week or two ago, where the sound is a bit more subdued:
https://youtu.be/42k97zDFnhE

I'm not great with computers, but my suspicions are that the HDDs might be the problem, due to them sounding too loud when I write something on them anyway. I've been using HDDs from the same brand in the last 3 years and I've never been able to hear them recording data before I bought this computer. The HDDs are 2 x 2TB Seagate Barracuda ST2000DM008, SATA 6Gb/s, 7200rpm, 256MB, 3.5"" (8.89cm)

fpopqn,DarkMain,Calculating power draw for a PSU?,"Ok, so first of all, I know this is NOT ideal but I want to see if I can make the best of a bad situation.  


So here in NZ we have just started a 4 week lock down and on day 1 my one week old GPU decided to kick the bucket. Its completely dead and I have no way of getting it replaced until the lock down is over.  


Luckily I have an old GPU in my parts bin. The catch is its a 295x2. This thing is power hungry.  


My current build is an ITX and only has a 600W Gold (Corsair SF600) PSU in it which is WAY under powered for this card.  


Now I know 80 PLUS Gold should be at least 88% efficiency at 100% load on 230v (The box actually shows it at 91% at 100% load) which is (i think) about 685W from the wall (The only way I can measure power draw unfortunately).  


If I can tune the GPU (under clock / under volt / power limit) what would kind of draw from the wall should I be aiming for?  


I'm thinking if I can get it to hover around 600W from the wall that will be around 530W system draw and I should be all good without stressing the PSU, but I just want to double check.

fpomiy,gunnerajf44,Changed fan speed on GPU and 2 blue screens in under 1 hour.,"As the title says, I used MSI afterburner to change my GPU fan speed so I could have cooler temperatures playing games, I felt that 80 degrees was a bit hot (I was playing star citizen) so I wanted to make sure that it would be cooler. 

I adjusted my fans to turn onto a higher speed at a lower temperature and my idle temps sitting at desktop went from 55 to 38. I thought myself a genius, my temps were lower than ever before, and I was feeling proud. That was until I started to watch a youtube video and half way through, BAM, BSOD. 

My computer rebooted fine, and all was well. I went on to watch a few more youtube videos, and even a bit of netflix. I then wanted to play Star Citizen so I clicked on the launcher and BAM BSOD again. 

I figured me altering the fan speed was the main culprit because I havent had a BSOD in a LOOOONNG time on this PC and I figured with 2 in 1 day, the fan speed had to be the issue. 

I have now set EVERYTHING in MSI afterburner back to default, and I plan to never touch it again, I will only use it to monitor my temperatures. 

I guess this post is me asking anyone out there whether or not this could have been the issue, or am I just going nuts and another part of my PC is dying that I am unaware of.

fpoepx,tlavoie,Sudden drop in laptop battery capacity (Lenovo ThinkPad P50),"Hi all,

I've been using this laptop for a couple years or so. It's often plugged in, but with charging generally limited to 80% to increase battery life. Capacity has remained quite high, until yesterday.

Yesterday, the graphical indicator was showing that it was under half, which just appears wrong.

I have rebooted, both to see if it changes anything, and to see if anything looks different under Windows. (Usual OS is Linux). Anyway, no difference. I would expect a gradual decrease in capacity, not half all at once.

I’ve tried reinstalling audio drivers, using front and back audio ports, plugging my PC directly into a grounded outlet, reseating RAM, and plugging my headset into another PC (no static).

I’ve honestly ran out of ideas and the static is SUPER annoying. The only way I can make it tolerable is by turning noise suppression on but that makes my mic quality bad and quiet.

fpo252,DeRhamCohomology,Event 41 Kernel-Power random crashes,"For the last half a year, my PC has been randomly crashing. No BSOD, just a black screen and an immediate reboot, even though I have automatic reboots after crashing turned off in Windows and BIOS. Not much info in the Event Viewer, only Event 41 Kernel-Power, the EventData is all zeros. It can happen once in a few days or a few times a day, about once a day on average, on any type of PC usage.

Worth noting:

* I dual booted Linux a few weeks ago and have been leaving it on every night since, it has never crashed
* I upgraded my PSU and it stopped happening for two months, and then it started happening again and another PSU upgrade didn't help
* when I wanted to reinstall Windows, it crashed while trying to download some files for install, I tried again after reboot and it happened again. Then I tried running some drive tests on the SSD Windows is installed on and again it crashed while testing twice in a row. Then, the fifth time the diagnostic and the installer just worked no problem for the next few hours Windows was reinstalling
* temperatures are way too low to cause crashes I'd say
* I don't have my GPU or CPU overclocked.

Things I've tried which didn't help:

* Windows 10 clean install, kept the settings though
* Samsung Magician says the SSD is in good health...
* multiple Nvidia driver reinstalls
* GPU underclocking
* CPU test
* stress testing
* sfc /scannow.

fpnz2g,kajidourden,System semi-randomly restarting,"So I've started to notice my system shutting completely down and restarting under certain load conditions.  The weird thing is it's not consistent and doesn't seem to be following much logic in the way that it occurs.  

What I mean is sometimes it will occur in a particularly demanding game, other times I'll play that game for hours with no issue at all.  Sometimes it will happen with less than demanding games, but almost always during the load cycle of the game.  

The full restart as a symptom makes me think CPU overload but I figure if that were the case it would be consistent, and nothing on my rig is overclocked.

I have an 850W power supply, so I don't think it's an issue with current draw (barring any actual defective hardware)

Is there anything else I'm not thinking about that might be causing the system to crash/reset?  Also, my motherboard has a small 7-segment display it uses to print out codes for operation, but with this happening so suddenly obviously I don't have time to jump down and look at it.

My network consists of two routers, a main one (192.168.1.1) and a bridged one for wifi (192.168.1.140). 

I am trying to connect to my desktop on 192.168.1.102 from my Rasp Pi on 192.168.2.2. All requests come in from that device as the second router (.140).

- SOME traffic will go through to the desktop. SSH, ping, and VNC go just fine without custom forwarding rules However the one I need right now is connecting with XDMCP (X server).

- I CAN connect to my desktop from the main router. The desktop is receiving connections from within the network.

- It is NOT a wired or wireless problem -- I have tried both.

- It is NOT a client issue - I tried two devices. They both have the same behavior.

- I have tried default ports for that protocol (177) as well as custom ones.

The main router is a Netgear WNDR3400 flashed with OpenWRT; the bridged one is a Linksys E1000 with stock firmware. All of my devices are on Linux btw if that was not obvious from the X server thing.

fpnoel,theaim9,"Ghost ""Disk Drive Not Found"" UEFI message on startup, both drives still work fine?","It's not really a big deal, and I might have already solved the problem, but it is still a concerning issue. Whenever I start up my PC, it pulls up a message in the UEFI telling me disk drive not found and the only action is to click 'OK.' This closes the UEFI and starts Windows, which still boots and runs fine. Both (C:) and (D:) are also still fine, and all of the files are still intact so I don't think they are the issue. I started looking in the boot load options and of course the BIOS has my (D): drive listed as second in load order if it will not boot from (C:), but removing it from that list entirely seems to have solved the issue. I double checked my BIOS was the most current, since I had updated it myself when I put this PC together. This problem came out of nowhere this morning when I turned it on so I could set up remote desktop capabilities while at work today, it was totally fine last night. I have had this computer for 2 years now, no issues. I'm not a computer wizard or anything, but I have a basic grasp of troubleshooting and cannot figure out what could have caused it.

fpno0d,UOLZEPHYR,"Issues with wifi &amp; wired connection failure, is there a way to track?","Good evening everyone,

I have been having a very strange issue with my internet/wifi intermittingly dropping out and am wondering if there is anyway to log or track and possibly identify what the exact issue is. 

More info: 

I live in a very small town in S. Texas; this particular area I live in only  has a very few options for internet due to it being an apartment complex. We have AT&amp;T as we had it at the other apartment and it was the best option we had coming over. 

We both agree we didnt have this issue at our previous residence which is less than 5 miles from where we reside now. 

Router details: 

Pace model: 4268 FXN

This was a router AT&amp;T provided when we moved into our original location. 

We always seem to have loss of wifi at 7,8 and 11 pm and at 1 am. 

My wired connection will just randomly drop all connection as well at times and then come back up in 5-10 minutes. 

These events will occur when there is only 1 person on the network or 5 people on the network (pc/xbox/netflix etc.)

The only plan offered here is 5/1, sadly. 

We are seeing a normal Pace error indicating router is not getting out to the internet. 

Anyone have any idea?

Thanks in advance !",0,1585271007,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpno0d/issues_with_wifi_wired_connection_failure_is/,techsupport,1

Two days ago, I've installed the latest Nvidia GeForce driver, and ever since, I've noticed that certain programs were getting these freaky glitchy visuals all over the place. Here's what it looks like: https://i.imgur.com/jAe3sv5.png

These glitches only happen occasionally, can be removed by minimalizing and maximizing the window, or opening the Task Manager (though this does not always work), and I've only seen them happen with Firefox &amp; Discord so far, nowhere else.

All my drivers are up to date, I've tried turning off hardware acceleration for both programs, but the glitches still persist. What else can I do to try and fix this?

fpnkg0,boarhonor,Debloater? Virus? Where did I go wrong? Why can't I factory reset?," I've had my Dell Inspiron 7586 for just about a year. Just had our anniversary. I'm not professional when it comes to pcs. I use my computer for digital illustration, web browsing, and gaming. I check every file I download for viruses using VirusTotal. I only download from sources I trust and research. Basic Windows security. \~95% of my ram is completely free. However, as I'm sure you all know quite well, Windows loves to force you to run apps you don't want, and I wasn't a fan of Cortana, Onedrive, and Candy Crush. I found Chris Titus' debloater script, watched all the steps thoroughly, read every comment, made sure I knew what I was going to be doing. I felt confident, from the comments and watching the process happen, that I would just be getting rid of what I don't need. I knew that some files I might not want to lose could be deleted, so I customized the blacklist and got rid of the bloatware.

Well...I guess I missed something. I'm sure I made an error somewhere. Anti virus software doesn't find much, but I haven't completely ruled that out. It's hard to find anything reliable. Factory reset can't be completed. I can't do system restore. I can't download old drivers I need, like WavesAudio, because I'm missing the microsoft store app. Hell, I just wanted it all gone. I got my wish!  I'm not sure what information would be the most useful for you guys, but I'm willing to provide any info that can help.

This is the first occurence of such a regular failure but my gpu has a history of unreliability. the gpu error messages have happened occasionally (once a week with usage of around 4 ish hours a day). i ruled this up to possible instability with my gpu core so i downclocked it by about 100MHz so as not to sacrifice too much performance and maybe increase stability. i feel like i got a bottom bin GPU and im hoping there isnt too much else wrong with my system. the card is evga",1,1585270397,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpniga/regular_frame_drops_and_render_device_lost_errors/,techsupport,1
fpnhyp,SignalWrangler4,"Computer behaves as if overheating, but temps normal","I built my second computer a few days ago, and I'm having a very strange problem. After some power time (it was usually about 6 hours a few days ago, now it seems like about 2 hours or less), programs glitch out or close, new programs won't open (terminal says it segfaulted), and finally the whole thing locks up. When it locks up like this, it won't respond to Magic SysRq commands. Holding power button and rebooting immediately causes debug information to appear on my screen. Sometimes this will include register dumps, a message about CPU #Something (not always the same number, sometimes just 1 CPU, sometimes multiple) being offline, or a message about some process being or not being tainted. Waiting 2-5 minutes before reboot will make the same problem appear in under an hour, waiting longer seems to reduce the problem. Sounds like a thermal issue, right?

Well, my temps are all normal. Going into BIOS shows my CPU in the 30-45 degree (Celsius, obviously) range after this happens and my motherboard never breaks 35 degrees. PSensor didn't report my GPU getting any higher than 39 degrees. I don't have temperature sensors on my RAM, but if touch the heat spreader ASAP after I power off the PC, it's warm but not hot. I've had the same issue after booting into my Windows hard drive, so it's probably not my hard drive overheating. In addition, all but one of these hard drives were harvested from my last build, and the only thing wrong with that machine is that it died in a lightning storm (I had tracked the damage down to either the motherboard or CPU, and decided to just upgrade both).

What's going on here? How do you diagnose and fix a thermal problem when all temperatures are normal?


Computer Type: Desktop, custom

GPU: RX-460 (harvested)

CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700X

Motherboard: MSI x470 Gaming Plus Max

RAM: 4x G-Skill Ripjaws V 4GB (harvested)

PSU: EVGA 750 BQ

Operating System: Dual boot: Linux Mint 18.2 (using a 4.15-series kernel)/Windows 7 (with this driver fix https://www.overclock.net/forum/13-amd-general/1731246-guide-fixing-windows-7-usb-support-matisse-ryzen-3000-zen-2-x370-x470.html) (Both hosted on harvested drives)

**This fix causes bluescreens at boot about 80% of the time, but if it boots it'll work until the thermal issue brings it down.

Background Applications: N/A. Problem occurs across operating systems and without regard to what programs I'm running.

Description of Original Problem: See above. Nothing is overclocked. System is air cooled. Case and fans both harvested from last build.

Troubleshooting: I tried changing the thermal paste and running stress-ng (CPU tests only, 16 threads, cpu-method=all) just to see what would happen. I ran the stress for about an hour and a half, then rebooted (voluntarily) to check my temps in BIOS. It said I was at 79 degrees, which I thought meant I was on to something, but it turned out that I had just forgotten to plug my cooler back in. It was around this time I noticed that it seemed to take less time for the problem to show up, but I can't say for sure if it started before this or another run or two after this.

At some point I reinstalled Linux to fix a different issue I was having. I don't think it fixed that issue, but now I can't get AMDGPU-PRO to install again. I think that's just because I forgot how to trick AMD's shitty install script into treating a very Ubuntu-based distro as Ubuntu. I hope one of the old tarballs I downloaded will install, because I know for a fact that AMD ""fixed"" later versions of their drivers so that you can't trick them into installing on Mint. Wasn't that nice of them?

I haven't yet run a memory tester, but I will soon. I'm currently waiting for whatever part it is that's too hot to cool down again.

fpn46m,Spincrusha,Random Micro-freezes While Gaming,"Hello, a little bit of a wall here. I'm at wit's end and it's driving me nuts.   


I got this computer just about a year ago from cyberpower and this issue started a couple months 

ago. I tried a few fixes and I do not know what else to do. 

I mainly use this computer for gaming. I do not use it for anything else (especially porn, so definitely not from anything like that.)  


A couple months ago I was playing FFXIV and I noticed it started to freeze for fractions of a second, then be fine for a minute or so, and then again, and then again. I started looking into this issue and the first thing I narrowed it down to was a faulty storage. I contacted cyberpower and got a replacement SSD. The issue persisted.   


I contacted a third party support from a discord group I'm in, and after having him mess with the guts of my computer and testing my RAM among other things, he came up with nothing and I contacted cyberpower again. After a very frustrating experience with their customer service, I narrowed it down to a faulty graphics card. I just got a new sent from them, and the issue is still there. The only thing left I can think of is my motherboard, but I decided to ask here as a last string of hope before contacting them again.   


&amp;#x200B;

My build is as follows:   
ASRock Z370 Pro4-CB  
i7-8700k  
Nvidia GTX 1660Ti  
16GB RAM  
Windows 10 Home

Any other info you need please let me know.

Thank you if you are able to help. I'm semi literate with a computer but not an expert. I can answer basic questions but I may need to ask what you mean about certain questions you may have for me.

Hello there! 

I don’t know if this is the right thread but I need some help figuring out something! 

So I recently bought a bundle through the eshop on my Nintendo Switch of Assasins Creed that includes both Dark Flag and Rogue and while playing it I found something that I don’t know if t should be working like this or if it’s a glitch/error

When the main character talks directly with someone on the game I can’t hear it at all, however I’m able to listen to people on town talking or even the whistle that the character makes 

Any suggestions or tips are appreciated!

I just built this computer recently, and I have been having issues with the headphone and mic jacks. I have a Sennheiser GSP300 headset, which I have tested with my Xbox One and my laptop and it works just fine. The issues I have been having are that if I use the front panel jacks, the audio is extremely quiet even with the volume cranked (these are not high impedance headphones, 19 ohms), and the mic will echo my game audio through it. If I use the rear I/O jacks, the volume level is fine, but my mic volume is so low that I have to crank the gain in Windows and Discord all the way up and it is still too quiet, but I get no echo. I tested the volume difference with my Apple earbuds and it is the same issue (couldn't test the mic because separate ports).

Also, if I use the mic in chat on the Xbox companion app, it puts a loud hissing noise over my mic feed that really annoys my friends in chat. It only does this in the Xbox companion app, I do not have this issue in Discord or on my Xbox.

I have made sure my BIOS and all my audio drivers are up to date and nothing changed. If anyone has any ideas of what might be wrong I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",3,1585267730,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpmt3h/multiple_headphone_and_mic_issues/,techsupport,1

Battlefield V, Jedi Fallen Order, Squad and Assassins Creed Odyssey all crash to desktop within 10 - 30 min of playing. Weirdly, I can't recall Rocket League ever crashing. Games look amazing while they run, buttery smooth and impressive graphics.

Temps seem to be good, CPU in the 50s and GPU in the 60s Celsius. I've updated Bios drivers recently, and today used DDU in safe mode to reinstall GPU drivers. I'm super close to calling a local PC repair shop, but I thought I'd give this a shot first. Here's the specs:

Last year I heard a popping sound (just one pop) and then smelled a bit of smoke, and saw that my LED strip wasn't on anymore, and haven't been able to get it to work again. Finally opened it now because I've got nothing else to do in self isolation.

If it's possible to tell that this PCB isn't the problem, am I right in assuming that the power brick that plugs into this thing is what popped and smelled?",0,1585266737,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpmjde/rgb_controller_broken/,techsupport,1

fpmheu,BluBearry,My computer crashes all the time,"My computer shuts down unexpectedly all the god damn time, and it is driving me nuts.

Sometimes it will go a couple of days without crashing, other times it will be on for 2 minutes and then crash - and then repeatedly crash every 2 minutes when I turn it on again.

I have no idea what is causing it. I can rule out the GPU, because it will crash without any programs running. I know it sounds like the PSU, but I think it has something to do with the CPU, because applying thermal paste to it, will usually help a bit for a little while (although it will still immediately crash if I try to run a more performance heavy game like Fortnite or Apex: Legends). But it's still strange that it crashes without anything running, if it's the CPU that's overheating, right?

I also tried switching out the RAM, so I know that's not it either.

It worked fine for a couple of years, and then suddenly this problem started occurring. Do you guys have any ideas for something I could try to narrow what's causing this, or something that might solve it?

Before we get any further let me say that one of the side effects of said virus was about half of my games crashing. I let this slide for a month before I finally decided to really do something about it. Now with a fresh install and everything new I have reinstalled Steam and GOG for testing to make sure I'm not having problems with the launchers. I have since found that I am getting crash to desktops on every single game I own whether it is the most taxing of games or what basically amounts to a flash game. I can play for about 5-15 minutes when it crashes to desktop. I have installed new drivers for audio, MOBO, and GBU. And I've messed with my graphics settings to death. I have also been monitoring my GPU and CPU usage with MSI afterburner and everything seems normal, I have also used that program to underclock my GPU core clock by about 200. Still nothing and I don't know where to go from here I have no idea what is happening.

I own a Satechi USB C hub that provides additional connectivity to my MPB, and I was hoping to use the HDMI port on the adaptor to connect to one of the two HDMI ports on the display. 

For some reason though, after connecting then with an HDMI cable, my Macbook will detect the monitor and appear to be connected, but the display continues to indicate that no signal is detected on the corresponding HDMI channel.

I’ve seen that Dell advises using the DP&gt;mDP cord that comes provided with the monitor, but I’d really prefer not having to buy another dongle (DP&gt;USB C).

PC shut down during Witcher 3 and never turned back on lol. Was running for around a year prior with no issues.

fpmayv,cherry_mx_blue,Problem I've been struggling to fix for a year.,"Ever since I built my pc a problem as been happening often. Sometimes when I am playing a game such as CSGO or escape from tarkov my pc will turn itself off. 

The monitor will go black and the pc's fans will stop spinning. To turn on the pc again I need to unplug it from the wall and plug it back in. The lights on the motherboard stay on. Could the problem be overheating? It only happens in some games, I have never had a problem with other games such as Rainbow Six Siege. Underclocking my gpu to a signifigant amount (1366mhz to 960) seems to reduce the amount of times it happens but does not get rid of the issue. I keep the cpu fan and case fans (2 exhaust no intake, NZXT H500)

It's a Nixeus EDG-34, a 34"" Ultrawide monitor that is supposed to be 1440p @ 144hz refresh rate. However, I am only getting 60hz and 100hz as my options. Things that I have done and tried:

1. Update Drivers and restart
2. Install new AMD Radeon Software and restart
3. Tried both DP ports in the monitor using the DP cable it came with (product states that I can only achieve 144hz with DP, 100hz for HDMI)
4. Tried a different DP cable in both DP ports
5. Tried using an HDMI cable and tried both HDMI ports in the monitor (only got 50hz)
6. Lowered resolution to 1080 and saw option for 144hz. This monitor is advertised to be able to run 144hz at 1440.

I should probably mention that my graphics card is an AMD Radeon HD7950. Yes, I know it's very old (I am looking to upgrade soon when the 3080 cards get announced), however this user appears to have the previous generation variant of my card and seems like he does not have any trouble achieving 144hz @ 1440p.

So I'm trying to help my family out

They just moved in to a new house. They have a router modem combo in their garage that has the Ethernet lines running through the house to the living room, office, and bedroom. Their wifi speeds are terrible though because the router/modem is in the garage in the wall.

I think the best solution for them is to buy a nice router to hard wire in the living room (the middle of the house). I was going to recommend they put an **ASUS AC2900** there and use it for the wifi

They have internet thru Media Com which seems to have very limited compatibility when it comes to modems. They are renting a **Hitron CGNM - 2250**. No other modem that is listed as compatible with Media com has all the Ethernet outputs needed to supply 3 other rooms with hardwired Ethernet connection (just 1 Ethernet to a router on the ones listed as compatible).

So would this set up work well? Or will it actually not work at all? Is there better options than this? Thoughts?",2,1585265312,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpm4q3/can_i_hook_up_a_router_to_a_routermodem_combo/,techsupport,1

I have contacted support and the not very well spoken man was not able to help me.

fplvq1,Yusarow,Only Fortnite has high ping on my PC.,"Hello,

Two days ago my game (Fortnite) started to have a high ping (100) and normally I have 20-30 ping. There is also some packet loss between 4-14%. 
Funny thing is that other games like League of Legends or Apex Legends are totally fine and don't lag at all.
And the even funnier thing is that my boyfriends PC has the normal ping of 20-30 and no packet loss at all! And the PS4 is just fine as well, so it's just my PC..

If anyone could help me with this then I would be so glad because my boyfriend can't find any fix at all.

What has been tried so far without success:
Bitdefender full System Scan.
Router change.
Ethernet cable switched.
Malware scans (different programms).
Registry edit (TCPNoDelay).
Unknown Programms uninstalled.
Closed all unnecessary programms in task manager and adjusted the startup for only necessary things.


If anyone has any ideas, please let me know since I don't really want to reset my PC because my Streamlabs Overlay would be ruined and I would have to make it completely new.",3,1585264401,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fplvq1/only_fortnite_has_high_ping_on_my_pc/,techsupport,1
fpluwn,my_dogs_a_devil,PC Won't Boot After Moving Components,"I bought a new case recently, and moved all of my (previously working) components into it. After hooking everything up and attempting to boot, the PSU fires up, the CPU fan starts to spin, and then in less than a second everything shuts down. Ive tried disconnecting all components (RAM, GPU, hard drives), and just booting with the the motherboard/CPU connected, but still no luck.

I've verified my PSU still works using the paperclip method and it runs by itself fine. From what I've read, seems like it must be the CPU overheating, or I've fried my motherboard somehow. I thought it was likely the CPU overheating given i disconnected the CPU cooler when I moved, and noticed the thermal paste was very old and dried (PC about 6 years old). But I got fresh new thermal paste today, cleaned off the old and applied the new, still same symptom. Is there any way for me to verify if my motherboard is toast or know if it's my CPU causing the shut down, short of bringing it to a repair shop? Might be willing to order some tools to test if necessary and not too expensive. 

Here's some pics w/ RAM attached, but as I said i tried removing that and running as well, still no luck.

New DisplayPort cable: still crackling

Connecting laptop to Monitor via HDMI: no crackle

At this point, should I assume it's a monitor DisplayPort  connection issue? I've tried every possible combination of things I can. Looking online has pointed me towards a possible electrical/grounding issue, but I don't know how to diagnose that.

fploou,OfficerDash,Constant BSODs - only on Windows 10. Likely a driver issue - but can't figure out how to fix.,"Hey, I've been having issues the past few weeks with my new build. I've installed Windows 10 on it - and I seem to always get seemingly random BSODs, with errors that are never consistent.

It's always something like INTERRUPT_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION, or something like this. I read different posts - and many mentioned that it's a possible RAM issue. I ran several passes of memtest86 and had no errors. I recently installed Ubuntu - and suffered no crashing or freezing whatsoever - and returned to Windows 10 after some frustration with Ubuntu.

I'm at my wits end in trying to figure out what's going wrong. I've installed Bluescreenview to read up on my BSODs - [but I can't ever seem to extract any useful information from it.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/384840741265997826/692870074356203572/Screenshot_2.png)
(This is a fresh install of Windows 10 from yesterday. I had many more logs from before with different check strings, but usually the same drivers involved.) 

I'm using a AMD RX580 8Gb, a Asus B450M motherboard, a AMD Ryzen 3 3200G 3.6Ghz CPU, and I'm using 16 GB of 2x8gb DDR4 ram.

I know this is a tall order and there's alot of info - but could anyone here help point me to what driver could be causing the issue? I don't think it's hardware as Ubuntu ran without issues and I've read in different threads on this subreddit that Win 10 seems to have driver issues like this sometimes.

I just built a new pc after old one fried so am downloading all the old drivers and programs I use, and the plug n play usb scanner i have was the least of my worries in all this. The drivers online that are available are the original drivers from 2015. 

However about a year (maybe two now but not long ago) I remember having the same issues as I am now with the old drivers: they just dont work well anymore if they work at all, googled, and clearly remember reading an hp support forum with the same question and a link to the newer hp easy scan being posted. Downloaded that and it solved everything and seemingly made the scans better too. The driver was VERY different looking (more modern) from the old one: the logo was a profile view opened flat vector blue scanner...not a grey and cmyk graphic that looks like it came out of 1998.

Well its 2020, and no matter which way I google and search it seems that hp easy scan doesnt exist for windows anymore. It's like it disappeared from the internet entirely. I even found a similar thread on hp's forum that's really old and has links to what seems to be the right thing...but the links are all dead now.

fplhp2,BKGaming_,Bypass CGNAT to get Open NAT on Xbox Live?,"Hello,

So I live in a rural area and have limited options for internet. I recently got internet through a service that offers unlimited data using AT&amp;T 4G towers. This has, so far, worked great and allowed me to do normal things like use Netflix. The only issue is I can't get an open NAT on Xbox Live. DMZ, port fowarding, UPnP... nothing, due to I assume the CGNAT on AT&amp;T. 

The gateway I have is the MoFi4500-4GXeLTE. The MoFi Network offers basically VPN service called cloud link that supposedly will get you a static ip to get an open nat for $15 /month, that is what is recommended by my ISP. I am considering this but I've sent 2 emails this week to them and have yet to get a response (though I understand due to cronavirus some company's may be having issues providing support right now) and I'm not sure they offer unlimited usage. I've read comments online that it may be capped at 15GB /month, but I am unsure how accurate that is.

Other comments online suggested using a VPN service. My gateway has settings for PureVPN, ExpressVPN, and NordVPN. I contacted PureVPN sales department, asked about using PureVPN to get an open NAT as was flatly told by their rep that it would not work and I would be wasting my money. Which doesn't make sense to me because they advertise using port forwarding and PureVPN to configure CGNAT ( [https://www.purevpn.com/port-forwarding](https://www.purevpn.com/port-forwarding) ).

Can anyone give advise as to what the best option for me might be to get an open nat? Would it be cloud link? Or would using a VPN like PureVPN work, and the rep was wrong? Or some other method that would achieve this?

fpl2n9,bdanning09,Game / PC Crash,"Anyone have any ideas why my games or sometimes the entire pc will crash? I know its GPU hardware / driver related. I was pretty confident it was the physical GPU itself so I sent it back for direct replacement and I'm having the same problem with this 2nd card as I did with the first...

It's the XFX Radeon RX 590 Fatboy. Fresh build, fresh drivers. Load game, GPU heats up, once it reaches mid 70s it crashes. The only solution I've found was to make a custom fan curve. If I keep the temps below 75f I can play for hours. Almost anytime I download a new game, I run into new issues, if the PC crashes it'll reset back to default fan curve then I crash again.

Both AMD and XFX support tickets have gotten me no where. AMD says XFX needs to send me a new card because its a physical defect, XFX says its 100% driver related.

I just switched over from Manjaro to Windows 10, the first boot took well over 20 minutes and I was starting to worry.
Finally it boots up, and the UI is unbearably slow.

I spent the next like 12 hours disabling every possible service, included, but not limited to: Superfetch, Printer Spool, Windows Defender, Customer Experience, Every Diagnostic.

I ran HDTuner on my SSD and the results came back very positive, and the error check returned zero problems.

I looked at resource manager for clues and nothing shows up out of the ordinary.

I've also tried disabled MSI in the StorACHI Intel control driver. I've tried disabling trimming, and I've run the Windows hard drive optimizer.

I went through my BIOS and nothing seems to be different from the last time I ran Windows.

Again, everything was perfectly fine on Manjaro :(


Specs:
i7-4790k
16GB DDR3
Adata SU800 1TB
GTX 980 TI

PS: Disabling trimming solved my problem for about 15 minutes, then the response time spiked back up to between 500 and 30,000ms.

I have restarted multiple times and I also reset and reconfigured my pagefile.

fpklvg,bananarepubliccat,"Random shutdowns - much detail, big mystery inside","The problem is quite simple: every so often, my PC shuts down. Not under load. Nothing running. Just shuts down.

This started on or around 19/03. PC can for 16 hours without failure. Once it happens, it tends to occur again soon after (I have a timestamp of every failure if interested).

Once the computer shuts down, you either get:

1. Attempted restart immediately - this always fails and the computer fails to post properly with fans running on 100%. No error code on mobo (I don't understand this really).
2. Complete shut down - once shut down, it will fail to start once power button is pushed (either externally or on the board) about 50% of the time, 25% of the time it starts fine, and 25% of the time it gets jammed on posting with an error code of 19 on the mobo (Entry to CK505 programming, once I switch off and on again it works).

What you see about the crash inside Windows: no BSOD, no logs dumped for WhoCrashed, and the only error I see in Event Viewer is Kernel Power.

My theories:

Software (despite the nature of the error) - on 19/03 I installed some stuff (Razer mouse software, and some GPU drivers) so...that has to be it. No dice. I have reversed all these changes, and nothing. I have one last program to remove, I am in the process of doing this but it is unlikely to be causing this error as it doesn't interact with hardware.

PSU - obviously, with a sudden loss of power this is also very likely and the fact that the board sometimes just wouldn't switch on at all made me think this has to be it. Tried a known good PSU, same error (so far, it has just switched off completely and thrown the 19 error code on the mobo). I have also tried testing the load with PSU/CPU stress test, it looks fine.

GPU - swapped for a known good GPU, still happens.

Cooling - another likely option given that the error seems to come in phases...but no, have checked temps, and have four internal fans + a fairly hefty CPU + a 3 fan GPU (I have had cooling problems once, never again).

RAM - nope, tested with memtest and it is good.

CPU - I had a mild overclock on this, taken it off, and still throwing.

Mobo - I can't think of anything else at this point. The way it is shutting down and the failure to post makes me think this has to be it (if it isn't the PSU). I have checked all the PSU connections to the Board, they all look fine...is there any way to get confirmation on this? I am uncertain because the behaviour after shutdown is so erratic (one time, the fans that were connected to one header were running, and the others weren't...the connections were fine).

Hardware:

* Chinese PlexHD x79 knockoff (I know, but pls actually try and answer...I have had this running non-stop for about six months with no issues).
* E5 1650v2 - this is a server chip but can be overclocked
* 16GB DDR3 RAM
* GTX 1660 Super
* EVGA W1 80+ 600W - this is pretty budget but I have tested with a 750W 80+ Gold (also EVGA)

Yes, I understand that I seem to have a GPU that's not strong enough for this game, according to the Steam page's recommended GPU. But that doesn't explain why my monitor continues to glitch out even when BL3 has been both closed, and fully uninstalled.

Cleaned old thermal paste with cotton buds and nail polish remover(I know acetone can be controversial but I was advised it’s fine just be extra careful which I was)
Lightly air dusted inside of laptop and fan components

fpk1ht,st1nkymelon,Gaming computer atrociously slow,"As the title indicates, my ASUS ROG STRIX GL503 gaming laptop has suddenly experienced an extreme drop in quality while gaming. 

By no means is this computer extremely high end, but having bought it little over 2 years ago, it should definitely be able to run Fortnite *much* faster than the 20-odd FPS im getting right now on it.

For more background, this computer has always been relatively problematic, and most small problems  I have either been able to fix individually or work around. Only a few months ago I started noticing a slight drop in quality during games, which snowballed until I thought I had fixed it by hard resetting my PC; as I'm sure you can infer, the problem came back with a vengeance. The computer runs *terribly* in games, and I mean terribly. I can usually run the first game upon opening my computer for the day with no problems, but after that, I might as well be playing on a potato. I have tried various drive cleaners and antiviruses, including those in the post pinned to this subreddit, all of which have come back negative or fixing unrelated problems.

Best buy is closed for drop-offs in light of notable recent events, and with spring break coming up, I'm desperate for a way to fix this and play again.

The specs are below, and I'm sure I missed some critical information so feel free to ask questions.

fpjyop,goodsoul123,Complicated tech questions related to online learning,"Hi, everyone, this is new to me and I am not the most tech-savvy (hence I am asking help here in this forum) and hope for some creative solutions.

My brother and I run a education program where we go to preschools and learning centers to teach computer classes to little kiddos.  It started out as franchise business initially (we bought the business from a licensee years ago).  The licensor was small and a family-based (mom and two daughters ran the business with one of the daughter being the programmer).  The program is written in EXE files and installed into the computers and we travel to schools to teach classes.

About 5 years ago or so, the franchiser can't sustain the business and stopped the corporation. Meanwhile, all the licensee like us were told we could still use the program to run our business which we were very grateful and keep it operating (actually we had restructured our program then given more freedom and flexibility).  The problem now is that with all the Coronvirus situations, most of the schools we attend are closed and we know for older children, everything is moving online and that's what I am trying to get help from.

Because for our lessons(the program downloaded inside the computers) to work, we were given a license key to activate each computer and we can't possibly give that out to parents.  I heard I could rent a server (don't know enough about it) but then was told it would come costly (have to pay for bandwidth, how much data people read from your server. More data taking bandwidth, more money).  And then a friend told me even if I can get a VM from Amazon or Microsoft to use, it would be super pricy and also have limitations (one person play or access the VM at a time, etc). 

My brother told me if there is possible to make our EXE files temporary files so it would delete after certain time use and have these files online.  

Hope I am making some sense here.  Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.",3,1585257732,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpjyop/complicated_tech_questions_related_to_online/,techsupport,1

fpjwv7,cryptodynamism,How to fix incompatibility between Qualcomm wifi driver and FIOS router,"I’m currently stuck at home with my family’s wifi, which does not connect well to my Dell Inspiron 5493. The connection speeds are incredibly slow, I get about 1 Mbps download speed and maybe 20 Mbps upload speed based on the speedcheck .org tool. The router is a standard FIOS router. The speed is equally poor whether I am using Windows 10 or Linux Mint (I have them both installed). No one else in the house has this problem, and I’ve never had this connectivity issue anywhere else.

I’ve been reading a ton of threads by people who have had a similar problem (Dell support forums, third party sites, here on reddit), and all signs point to an incompatibility between my Qualcomm driver and the FIOS router. This makes sense, since I’m the only one in the house who is unfortunate enough to have this driver. The only solution that seems to work relatively consistently for people is to go into the router settings and disable WMM/QoS. I tried that, and all of the devices in the house completely lost their connection. Prior to that, I had tried all the other standard fixes such as updating the driver resetting the wifi connections, to no avail.

I was wondering if there’s any other way to solve this problem without disabling WMM/QoS. It’s really important that I get this fixed since I need to access my online classes- right now I have to do everything through my phone, which absolutely sucks.

fpjqbf,Alphacielago,PC keeps restarting with windows and windows installer,"Hello, I have had this problem for almost 2 weeks now. It started with my PC restarting randomly, and I couldnt do much with it, as it kept restarting minutes after the restart. These restarts were just black screens, I do not recall of any BSOD. I did also try going to safe mode, but the password didn't work for whatever reason, I tried to even crack it open but wasn't able to. I did not get any restarts when I was  in the safe mode login screen.

I decided then to wipe windows and reinstall it through a usb with windows media creation tool. 

The problem is that when I tried to do this, it kept restarting when booting windows installer through the usb. It did so both during the installation, where it would either turn completely black or give me a BSOD or a black screen and then proceeded to reboot. The BSOD shows Memory Management as the error.

I have tried changing motherboards, RAM, GPU, PSU and used different hard drive (both SSD and HDD). I have also tried using a different USB and the problem still persisted. I have also tried updating BIOS, and used different BIOS settings numerous times, as well as reverting to default.

I tried installing Manjaro OS (linux based) through one of my usbs. This worked fine, I was able to use this OS and install Manjaro properly on to my SSD without a problem.

I have also tried getting a different ISO Windows Installer file and installed it on my USB. The same problem came up.

I am at my wits end. This problem has made be insane at this point, and has cost me quite a bit of money. The only component I haven't replacing is CPU.

fpjnym,displayissues,Having strange display issues after restart,"I've been having some weird issues with my monitors. Everything was working fine last night but today after booting up my secondary monitor is getting no signal. It occasionally wakes up from sleep just to show a ""no signal"" message.

In my Windows 10 display options I see both monitors but one is shown as smaller for some reason instead of displaying side by side as usual. When I try to change ""Multiple Displays"" to anything besides ""show only on 2"" (my primary) my computer freezes up for a second and then shows an error message - ""The display settings could not be saved. Please try a different combination of settings.""

Both displays are connected to a GeForce RTX 2080 Super via displayport cables. Going to try switching one to an HDMI when I'm done with work and can pull one out from behind my TV (don't have an extra on hand).

So far I've tried a few things:

* Multiple restarts
* Unplugging and replugging everything (power, displayport cables on both ends etc) multiple times including dusting everything off before replugging.
* I've tried swapping the displayport cables and switching inputs - same behavior as described above
* Updating my graphics card driver

One other thing that's really odd - when I turn off/on my second monitor (or plug/unplug it) windows plays the device disconnected/connected sound. It's never done this before - I can turn off my primary working display and unplug and it doesn't have this behavior...

Throttlestop,"It’s been a long day trying to work around the constraints of my mid-range laptop with Throttlestop but there’s one thing which I really can’t work out, something probably dead obvious so a little help would be great...

You set your multipliers, core 0, core 1, etc... but the data read outs show the set ratio appearing on every core when running a stress test - hyperthreading turned off

For example: core 0, core 1 set at 42/41 respectively and 38 set for cores 2/3... but h/w monitoring tools will read a max frequent of ~4.2GHz and a minimum of ~3.8GHz for all cores present

Is this gap between multipliers dynamically managed and applied to different cores depending on workload? Why won’t my 42 core ratio seem to stay on one single core??

fpixue,ProximityZone,PC consistently has micro lag stutters? HELP,"PC Build:  


**MB:** ASUS x470-F 

**Processor:** Ryzen 3800x

**GPU:** ASUS 1080-TI Strix

**Ram:** G.Skill TridentZ Neo (8\*4) (F4-3200C16Q-32GTZN)

**PSU:**  EVGA SuperNOVA G2 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply 

&amp;#x200B;

To explain the issue, every 5 or so minutes, my computer will stutter. I notice that in games the FPS will drop from 300+ to 100 or below. Initially, I thought the issue had to do with my Ram or my processor, though I replaced them a few months ago and I am still struggling with the stutters. When this happens, it makes it almost impossible to play a competitive game. It even does it outside of games when I am using other applications such as Photoshop or Illustrator. Right now, my thoughts is that it could possibly be my SSD as it is nine years old (it also holds my OS). This has been happening for well over a year now though and I am not exactly sure how to run a diagnostic test. Besides that, I'm worried it could be my graphic's card as well due to the frames dropping. I have made sure to update all my drivers, though they did not resolve the issue.  


I can't record the issue through my system as screen recording doesn't capture the lag, though if necessary I could set up a camera to record the screen. I don't mess around with overclocking or any of my bios so I assume nothing could naturally go wrong there, but then again I'm not sure.

fpiuuq,whoshearts,"DPC Latency and ""robotic"" audio playback issue.","Hello, I've been having an unfortunate problem with my audio for about two months now and I'm looking for any help I can get. I will literally donate money to the person that helps me solve this issue, as it is driving me crazy. 

[Here is a link I posted to my audio interface manufacturer's subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Focusrite/comments/f51ejh/3rd_gen_2i2_playback_becomes_robotic_sounding/)

I don't remember having this problem until I updated my Scarlet 2i2 gen 2 Audio Interface to a gen 3 of the same interface. 

I notice this problem when listening to Lofi Beats to Study and Chill to, on Zoom, and when I'm playing video games. My quick fix is to open the Focusrite Audio Panel and change my sample rate, then change it back. My default sample rate is 48000. Higher buffer sizes, for example 1024, make my audio consistently fuzzy and slightly robotic, so my buffer size is set to 128. 

These are my PC's stats:

* Windows 10 , 10.0, build: 18363 (x64)
* Mobo: Asrock TRX40 Taichi
* Processor: AMD Ryzen 3960x Threadripper
* Video Card: EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 TI
* PSU: Seasonic Focus 750w Gold
* RAM: PCL Premium 16gb 3600Mhz

Here is some LatencyMon screenshots. Please note that the information in my tests often changes, for example, nvlddmkm.sys was a bigger culprit in last nights test than it was here, and the app that has the most frequent hard pagefaults changes from test to test. dxgkrnl.sys always shows up in my LatencyMon reports.

I notice that it says to disable CPU throttling, but I don't know where that is. My research hasn't led me to anything and I don't know why or if my CPU would be throttling. Also, it says my clock speed is incredibly low. That is not an accurate reading, I don't know what is causing that. 

Here are the solutions I've already explored: 

* Update BIOS
* Try other audio interface
* Try beta drivers for interface
* Check sample rate to make sure aligned in all settings
* Reinstall NVIDIA drivers
* Disable all network devices and update their drivers
* Check for viruses then remove anti-virus software.
* Update all drivers
* Adjust NVIDIA control panel settings
* Turn on all relevant high power settings
* Uninstall all other graphics or audio drivers on the system 

I have also relayed LatencyMon results to the interface manufacturer and /u/tomfocusrite and performed all tasks they've told me to try.

It was weird because when I did the case swap, I didnt unmount the cpu cooler at all. A note is that I did have the radiator on the top as an exhaust but now I have it positioned in the front.

The pumps seem to be working as one is hot and one is cold, is there any other way to check if its clogged?

GPU: AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series   
Board: Gigabyte	GA-770TA-UD3   
Disk:	WDC 596 GB SSD (WD6400AAKS-65A7B2)
   
   My Windows partition crashed all of a sudden so I started from scratch with a full `format c:` and fresh Win10 install. Ever since, however, the PC seems to randomly ""freeze"" for up to 3 minutes but then again working hours without issues. Oddly enough this also doesn't happen during gaming or when there is high load but e.g. during startup (stuck windows loading wheel), opening a new Chrome tab or even just on the desktop trying to open the Task Manager. When this happens it's not a full lockup (NumLock still reacts, sound from videos keeps playing) but the PC just keeps responding until it eventually catches up and e.g. opens 3 tabs at once.   
  All hardware and drivers show up as working correctly in windows and BIOS and Scandisk can't find any issues with the SSD. However, the machine is obviously a bit out of date and the time when I fiddled around with hardware configs and knew what was going on even more so. This is also the first SSD I built in and I'm not even sure they should be having near [100% active time](https://imgur.com/wiPr2kX) while basically idle in desktop.   
   
   I'm suspecting a problem with the disk or RAM at this point because I figured CPU/GPU problems would be more apparent during load and more consistent.

fpilax,ShabranigdoT,How to solve a possible GPU thermal throtting at only 56C/143F on a laptop (ThinkPad P53s)," 

I have a ThinkPad P53S which I use it for light gaming. The specifications are as below

* Intel i7 - 8565U 1.8GHz /UHD Graphics 620
* 16 GB RAM
* Nvida Quadro P520 Driver versoin 442.74

The gaming I currently play is Divinity Original Sin, which runs on Quadro P520. After a simple research, I beleive P520 has sufficeint power to run this game smoothly. 

I run this game mostly at 1600x900 at graphic setting of High or Ultra. The game alway starts with FPS around 40 - 60, and with the framrate dropping to below 20 FPS after been running for 30 - 60 seconds. From there the framrate varies widly from 60 to single digit FPS. I tried running the game at both lower and higher resolutoin, but this issue presist. 

I used MSI Afterburner and GPU-Z to monitor the Quadro P520 performance during the gaming. It turns out P520 severly downclocks itself when the temperature hit 56C /132F. Sometimes the clock speed is reduced to 100 MHz, making the FPS drop to a single digit range. P520 has a base clock speed of 1300 MHz, and during the game, it rarely hits the speed. 

It seems P520 throttles at 56 C which is way to low for a throttling temperature even for a laptop GPU in my understanding. 

I have it tested under both Power Plans of Balanced and High Performance. And this GPU throtting issue is always there. 

* Here is the [GPU status](http://imgur.com/gallery/XxxqA0d) recored during gaming by GPU-Z. The GPU-Z screen shot during gaming. You can see the GPU clcok speed varies a lot and the PerfCap (Performance Cap) reason is thermal (temperature limit) as indicated by GPU-Z in Magenta bars. 
* HWinfo also indicated that the GPU was throttling due to hitting a tempearature limit which is only [56C](https://imgur.com/gallery/3wbr6e0).
* Here is the [in-game footage](https://youtu.be/rYoaNmH2INw) recorded by MSI Afterburner. You can see how FPS drops synchronize with GPU downclocking when the temperature hit 56 C /132F .

Can someone give me an idea of how to resolve this issue ? Any adivce is highly appreciated.

fpihxw,Keihass,2700x vs 3600 build," Hi

I'm planning to build me a new pc that's gonna be mainly focused on audio production (ableton live) and video editing (premiere and after effects) then to a much lesser degree occasional gaming (if a game runs on medium settings with a 60 fps average on 1080 that's more than great)

For now Ableton works more than perfectly with my current i5 7400, so I'm pretty aware that any modern cpu can handle my audio production workflow. It's the video editing aspect that isn't working well with my current set.

In my country the 2700x and the 3600 are priced equally at 180€ and I know that theoretically the 2700x would be better for video rendering thanks to it's additional 2 cores/ 4 threads. However do you think that there might be an advantage for getting the 3600 with it's new architecture and higher single threaded performance (in after effects for example)?  
It's note worthy that I'm not planning to have any hard overclocking and I'm gonna get an after market super silent cpu cooler (a be quiet for example) because I need the silence for all the audio recording.

For the gpu I have a 200€ max . And I was thinking of getting a rx 580, but do you have any other suggestions in the same price range?

Windows troubleshooting tells me that a peripheral does not appear to be plugged in. Has anyone encountered this or have a solution I haven't tried? Thanks!

-Uninstalled and reinstalled from Device Manager

-Updated all drivers in device manager

-sfc scannow (No integrity issues)

-Windows troubleshooting

-Reformatted computer (Wiped everything and reinstalled Windows)

-Problem was still there before Windows update and after all updates

-Realtek Audio Manager (disabled and enabled jack detection)

-Tried the peripherals on laptop and they work fine (speakers and headphones)

-Opened up computer to check connections or if anything was amiss and everything looked clean. Also reset battery for good measure.


Side Notes: 

-I/O audio jacks in back don't detect and headphone jack in front does not detect (USB slots work)

-I tried to configure in the BIOS but because this is an HP computer, they only allow limited access to the BIOS. Not sure how to work around this.

I've a small issue/doubt with my gpu, which is an MSI RTX 2060 Super Gaming Z, regarding it's temp after playing a game for some time and when it's iddle.


Since the gpu has fan stop, the temperature usually stay between 50-57 degrees in iddle, unless I turn the fans on, then it goes down to roughly 30 degrees. 


During gameplay the temp seems fine  (63-67° C), however when exiting a game after 1 or 2 hours of playing, the gpu temp doesn't go below 59°. (the gpu fans only turn on at 60°)


Is this type of constant temperature bad for the gpu in the long run or nothing to worry about? 


My case is the meshify C with 2 nf-a14 in the front at 800-1000rpm and the stock fractal fan as exhaust. 

I have already added a 120mm fan on top, as suggested on the Nvidia subreddit, but it didn't change the temp.

fphyhw,rupertpupkin1323,Newly Built PC has Boots into Recovery Mode from Cold Start,"Hi All - I will try to give as much background as possible and specs of my rig.  I have been troubleshooting for two months, so I am not sure how to proceed anymore.

Specs:  
CPU: Ryzen 5 3600  
GPU:  GIGABYTE RX5600XT  
MOBO:  Asus Prime X570-P  
Memory: G.Skill 16GB (2 x 8GB) Aegis DDR4 PC4-24000 3000MHz  
Harddrive: SanDisk Ultra 512GB SSD  
PSU:  Thermaltake Smart BX1 RGB 80+ Bronze 750W  
OS: Windows 10 PRO

The issue:  
When I start my PC from a cold start (has been powered off entirely), the PC will boot up and the Asus logo will appear with the spinning dots.  After a few seconds, it black screens.  I power the machine off entirely and power back on.  It does this three times until on the third time is boots into recovery mode.  If I choose ""continue to Windows 10"" it will restart and boot totally fine on the first restart.  If I choose ""startup repair"" it will begin repair and then error out after awhile.

When running, it's totally fine.  CPU/GPU are running cool, even when gaming.  If I restart after being in Windows, it boots back up fine.  It only boot cycles when it has been powered off entirely.

Troubleshooting I have done:

\#1 - Replaced parts one by one:

1. Tried new MOBO  -  ASROCK X570 PHANTOM GAMING 4 ATX
2. Tried new memory - Forget brand, but 2x8GB sticks
3. Tried new PSU - Rosewill 600W
4. Tried new SSD -  IPSG 240GB I PRO SSD DRIVE

\#2 - Reset CMOS to no avail

\#3 - I have done clean installs of Windows 10 Pro, several times.  The same problem happens every time, on both hard drives I have tried and with all combinations of parts.

\#4 - I have updated Bios to the latest version.

\#5 - I have downloaded the AMD chipset drivers and used their recommended power plan.  I also have downloaded latest GPU drivers.

Conclusion:Apart from trying a new CPU/GPU, are there any suggestions on additional troubleshooting I can do?",1,1585251139,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fphyhw/newly_built_pc_has_boots_into_recovery_mode_from/,techsupport,1

Today I cleared chrome browser history on my phone (as usual, I don't enable the clear cookies option because I want my current logins to other sites unaffected). All is good. I checked the history and it was clear. Ok right?  

No. Then when I went to google to search something and when I clicked the search bar, to my horror, it showed all my previous searches! 

Then I thought, I might have not deleted the history somehow. Nope.   

I thought maybe I left my web activity on. Nope.  
  
Then I went to delete history and clicked clear cookies also. Which did delete all the history. But then how do I make it not remember anything. I don't wanna have to clear the search history with all the other login cookies all the time!

fphqx4,Obvcop,"Ram/ Mobo issues, wont post on CH6 Hero","So I bought 2 x 8gb crucial ballitix 3600mhz ram to upgrade my computer from some similar micron ballistix sport 2400mhz. After installing the new ram I was able to boot into the bios and attempt to set the DOCP settings from the ram, it tried to post with these settings but was unable to and booted with 2666 jdec timings, I tried a few more times with different speeds then gave up and booted it at 2666. After using windows for about an hour I wrote down some timings and settings I wanted to try and shut down . Then I powered her up again so I could try some new settings in the bios, wouldn't even POST. Got stuck on post code b0 and wouldn't go past it.

I tried the safe boot button which reboots with last known safe settings but wouldn't post again, I also saw a few other post codes whilst trying to restart it including 15, 05 and d0. I tried putting in the old ram again but still I got similar post codes to last time, usually changing upon restarting it . I then tried various combinations of ram in all the different ram slots but nothing would post.

Also tried the clear CMOS button on the back with the power on and also with the power off and cable unplugged. The only thing I thought I hadn't tried was a bios flashback, so I downloaded the latest bios from the asus web page and put it on the 3 usb drives I had (after renaming with the utility). I then tried each usb in the flashback slot and held the button in for several seconds but it would only turn on hard blue, with an almost pulsing effect when pressed in for a few seconds, but nothing close to the activity I was expecting which would be the button flash on and off blue untill the flashback was completed. Now when I boot with any combo of ram I get error code 8, regardless. I'm at my wits end with this now and I have 2 more sticks of ram ordered incase I somehow destroyed all 4 sticks of ram.

fphky9,Kaddaman701,Notebook overheating during gaming and higher loads,"I have an older Acer Aspire VN7-791G-70M4 from 2014 with an i7 4710HQ and a GTX 850M. Back then, when I used it as my main PC, I upgraded it to 16 GB RAM, added an SSD (Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB) and installed Windows 10, so far so good. I recently unpacked the notebook and wanted to use it as an office PC and for studying and gaming while on travel. It is already 6 years old, but the performance is still very good.

&amp;#x200B;

While gaming, the CPU is constantly at \~90 °C, the GPU is fairly cool sitting at \~80-85 °C. I am aware that notebooks run a bit hotter than fullsize-PCs, but I think this temperature is quite concerning.

I now wanted to crunch a bit using BOINC, working for Rosetta@Home and GPUGRID. As soon as Rosetta starts, the CPU goes up to 95-98 °C and the CPU goes to thermal throttling. When firing up Prime95's small FFTs test, it also bangs into thermal throttling right away.

I experience this problem (the high temps) for some months now, but since I almost never used that notebook, I didn't look further into it and it remained unsolved. 

&amp;#x200B;

I already cleaned the whole notebook of dust and remounted the cooler a few times with new thermal paste. 

After repasting (tried Arctic MX-2 and MX-4), the temps are significantly lower for about two weeks. I don't remember the exact numbers, but they were a lot less concerning than the previously mentioned. After this time, the temps start to rise again and the circle of thermal throttling starts again.

Today, I tried a 0,5 mm thick thermal pad (GELID Solution GP-EXTREME, if that matters) because the copper cooler seems a bit scratched and I also thought the mounting pressure isn't enough. This only made everything worse, the idle loads were much higher and even with smaller loads, the CPU temperature jumped straight up to 95 °C.

I am now back to Arctic MX-2 and the temps are back to normal again, I assume this will last about two weeks again.

&amp;#x200B;

I am out of ideas now, this is not the typical ""Notebook overheats - just clean it""-problem, I think it is a bit more. Is the cooler just messed up, after all those years? I am tired of remounting the cooler every few weeks and almost want to just throw it into the bin (of course I will not, it is my beloved first good notebook and is otherwise working perfectly fine).

fpherc,amazingmrbrock,Windows 10 BSOD during boot loading with error message CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED,"This is a work computer for reference, I have all of our files backed up but I really want to save the install if I can because reinstalling all of the old programs will be a pain (More of a pain than this process).  


Yesterday we opened an email that froze the computer and had a weird attachment. We shut it down and since then I've been working on getting it working. I booted into safe mode with networking and ran malware bytes. While it was running the computer BSOD a bunch of times in a bootloop. 

I pull up the standard lists of troubleshooting options sfc /scannow (finds some errors fixes them), DISM /online (Wont operate unless windows can boot), and a few more.

Additionally I run Dells hardware troubleshooting environment which gives all of my components including the SSD a clean bill of health.

So I boot into the window advanced recovery environment and try to do a system restore. The system restore fails in the middle, and apparently swapped my c:\\(os) and d:\\(work files) drives so now d:(os). So I pull the second drive just to force it to boot off the right one. Back to the BSOD with CRITICAL\_PROCESS\_DIED. That brings me to this morning.  


So I arrive at work with my recovery tools. Pop my (freshly updated) Hirens boot usb in and load up into its environment. First off I run ESAT virus tool, finds some trojans that are living in our email client files. Then I run lazesoft Windows Recovery - Oneclick.

The problem persists.

Now when I run sfc /scannow I get ""Windows resource protection could not perform the requested action

When I run chkdsk /r I get ""The type of fyle system is NTFS.

Cannot lock current drive.

Windows cannot perform run disk check on this volume because it is write protected.""

I cant run  **Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth** because it apparently requires windows to be booted into in order to do an online health check. 

I'm not sure if theres anything else I can try. I feel like my MBR may not be hooking my windows install even with the second drive removed and the main drive forced back to C: (at least hirens says it is).

I bought a pair of cheap-o bluetooth earbuds a while back and they have virtually always been unable to pair with eachother.  I should have returned them but whatever.  I found a work around for using them with my phone (adroid, note 10).  If I want to use them on through my phone's bluetooth I have to do the following:  

1) Connect BT to LB(left bud).  

2) Connect BT to RB (right bud)

3) At this point, \[this is what I see\]([https://imgur.com/a/6t4uPib](https://imgur.com/a/6t4uPib)) but even though they're both individually connected, media will only play from one of them (whichever was most recently connected).  

4) After fucking around with my phone for a week I found out that if you drag from the top down (to see notifications there's a small button labelled ""media"" at the top right.  If I click that I then have an option to choose which, or both, connected devices should be playing media. \[Seen here\]( [https://i.imgur.com/ZPOebB0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZPOebB0.jpg) )  The default is obviously that only one will play media, but when I select both, I get the desired outcome.  

  

My problem is that I have been unable to find any similar option on my PC to allow media to play through multiple connected devices.

I asked her to call me back at the “fake” number she was calling from and I was going to send it to voicemail and then I would call her back.

Startup Failure:

The type initializer for 'MatterHackers.MatterControl.SlicerConfiguration.ProfileManager' threw an exception.

A quick google revealed this is something to do with the JIT Debugger, which is where my knowledge for this stuff falls short. Here are some basic troubleshooting things I've done before posting

* Restarted
* Done a clean boot
* Reinstalled MatterControl
* Tried an older version of MatterControl (the software never launched) 
* Tried to disable JIT Debugger through deleting it in regedit, also through Visual Studio and regular settings, still get the same error. 

I can also copy and paste the details it gives when it comes up with the error if that's any help.

Is the most reasonable/affordable solution to hardwire a 150ft Cat6/7 cable from the router in the main house all the way to the back house? If so, will I need to purchase another access point?

fpgnxi,ubuntutouchpad,Toushpad not working on a Toshiba R700-18Q with Ubuntu,"Hi everyone.

A few days ago I installed Ubuntu on this old Toshiba laptop. Everything was working fine (including an external mouse), except for the touchpad, which does nothing. I looked for some solutions online, but nothing worked.

I've tried enabling it through the FN+F9 combination, and it's not that  (plus, FN+F10 turns the numpad on and off, so I guess FN is  working fine).

I went to ""Ubuntu Software"" and there found something called ""Software &amp; Updates"" and launched  that. There's a tab called ""Additional  Drivers"" but after a few seconds of searching it says there are ""no  additional drivers available"".

On Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse &amp; Touchpad there's also nothing helpful.

fpgn1l,Tolemi959,Error - Insufficient memory resources,"Hey there!

Since a week I've been having issues playing certain games. After a random amount of time (sometimes instantly or sometimes I can play for hours). My game seems to crash and give me the following error message: ""Insufficient memory resources"". When it goes well I can play for an hour or 2, but other times it just crashes right when I start the game. Sometimes it makes my PC also shut off and restart, other times I have gotten a blue screen with the error message BEDAISY.SYS.

My specs:

Windows 10 Home 64-bit

Intel i7 7700K 4.20 GHZ

16(2x8)GB RAM 2400 DDR4

Nvidea Geforce GTX 1070

[My benchmark](https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/25817276)

[My specs + temps](https://puu.sh/FmUNR/09970176a3.png)
​

So far I've tried the following:

* I've checked for overheating. Nothing ever gets above 70-75C.

* I tried playing games on very low settings and I still get the same, no change, sometimes it even crashes on start up. I thought it's because of my PSU since it was a 450W 80plus Bronze. I have since then upgraded it to a CorsairTX850M. Unfortunately, this did not fix the issues I'm having. I had a clean windows install, also this does not work.

* I have stress tested my pc using Furmark and everything runs smoothly. No overheating as far as I can see and I get decent FPS.

Is there anything else I can still try? Thanks!

fpgg5b,dylanarrington01,Issue with high refresh rates on monitor causing bottom portion of screen to blur.,"Hi, for a few months now, I've been having issues where when I turn my computer on, for about the first 30 minutes, the bottom portion of my screen is impossible to look at. I have a 144hz monitor, and like to keep it at that, but the higher the refresh rate, the worse it looks. I can usually just get over it, as it goes away over time, but I'm wanting to know if, and how, to fix this.

I originally thought it was my monitor causing this, and it may still be, but I plugged another computer in via hdmi 2.0 once, and didnt have this issue. It is a 1440p monitor, so it may just looked like it was fine since it was displaying at 60hz due to hdmi limitations (main pc uses display port of course). My pc has a Tian X Pascal and a Ryzen 2700X (all drivers should be up to date) so I'm sure it isn't hardware limitations.

If anyone has any ideas as to what is causing this, I'd really appreciate any help or suggestions I could get. Here's some [pictures ](http://imgur.com/gallery/F6RafcE) to give an idea as to what it looks like.

This noise is a high pitch static but it becomes much worse and loud and deep whenever something is updating my main monitor. even moving my mouse around make a notable noise.  

I made a simple wire diagram to show because I know ground loops can be an issue. 

https://i.imgur.com/nS3O6x6.png

Please note that I had issues with noise before I added the ground that fixed it. there is no option to ground this amp so I soldered a wire on the bottom of the metal. that wire is just plugged into the wall on the ground pin. The noise does not go away when removing this ground.

I have also tried moving my wires around so that my AUX is as far apart from the other wires as possible, this had no effect. 

I'm not using a sound card its just plugged directly into my motherboard.

When I move the same exact AUX cord to my headset(the cord is removable from the earphones) and turn everything up all the way I do not hear any noise.

If anyone has a suggestion about how to better pinpoint the issue or have any solutions it would be much appreciated. Thank you all for supporting the tech community \^-\^

fpg8wm,Milktatoo,"My dad's facebook and chase account was hacked and $12,000 drained. What to make sure he's clean and security up to par? (more in text)","My dad was apparently hacked 2 days ago. It's looking like it originated from his AOL account being compromised. Unfortunately he doesn't really monitor his email box much, so he didn't see it taken and didn't see the chase alerts requesting password resets and withdrawl warnings. 

I don't know what kind of security aol accounts have. He gave me his password and it did require a recovery and password change via text to his phone, so I'm guessing they have some form of 2 factor. When I got in, I discovered the chase account requests and stuff in the spam and recently deleted folder. 

Apparently the hacker created a Venmo account under the email adddress and second chase account. I don't know what the purpose of the second chase account was, but the Venmo is what they apparently drained the money with. 

His Facebook account was hacked a week ago. The only evidence of that one was him sending everyone an offer for sunglasses with a suspicious link. 

Anyway, chase is handling the stuff on their end, but I'm going to drive down there and do a big security session. The problem is, I don't really know the modern day programs since I haven't had to deal with this in over a decade on my end due to all the protections and addons I use on my personal stuff. 

I don't know exactly how the hacker was able to get into his stuff. My original guess was a keylogger, but **he hasn't physically typed his passwords in ages**. He doesn't even know his passwords. They are all just stored on his computer. He originally freaked out because chase didn't automatically log him in after *5 years*. I didn't even know that was a thing. He tells me things have been slower than usual the last few days, but chocked that up to everyone being home due to the quarantine. 

At this point, I'm probably just going to **reformat everything**, **reset his router security**, swap him to **gmail** finally (I've been begging him to switch for ages since his AOL email is a dumpster fire of spam), and hopefully get a few protections in place so it doesn't happen again in the future. Noscript drove him nuts when i had that on his machine a decade ago, so any other browser security ideas would be great.

Also wondering if I should reformat his phone.

fpg5io,Marioaviation,Windows didnt start correctly. Possible SSD corruption?,"Hello r/techsupport! 

So a few months ago, i gave my almost 5 year old “gaming” desktop a few upgrades. I changed the RAM, motherboard, and cpu. This of course caused Microsoft’s servers to no longer identify my computer, and so windows got deactivated. After that, I had been trying to go through the troubleshooter many times in the activation tab of settings. This never worked... until 3 nights ago. Windows had finally been reactivated, and I finally believed all my struggled were over. Untilllllllll the next day. I tried to boot up my computer, but then that terrible blue screen that would haunt be for the next few days appeared. “Windows did not start correctly” hmm I thought to myself. Ive already seen this, so it should be no problem. Somehow i had been able to fix this a few months ago, but i do not Remember how. I tried a whole list of things, and searched the web for hours. Until i had made up my mind to get a bootable usb drive and redownload windows. I was planning to do it on my ssd because thats where it was already in, but it was too low on storage, so i had to do it on my hard drive. After a few minutes of setting up, i finally booted into windows, but it was too slow. By the time this happened, it was the end of the second day. On the third day, i got all my files and put them on onedrive. I redownloaded windows again, now onto my ssd. Again, i booted into windows, i was so happy. Everything was much faster, and i could leave behind all this mess. Nonono not yet. This morning, i tried to boot up, nope, “windows did not load correctly”. Really? Then i thought to myself, it only does this on my ssd, and some other games are also occasionally getting corrupted, and they are also on my ssd. Now i consult you, Im sitting here righting this as i wait for windows to download once again on my hard drive. Please tell me what you think, my theory is that my ssd is corrupted, as it is almost 5 years old.

fpg1b7,schaudhery,Xbox One X Connection Issues,"Not a huge gamer here but Microsoft sold the One X for $200 the other night so I jumped on it because of the quarantine.   Once I got it hooked up in my bedroom (used to game in the living room hardwired but I have a kid now) I noticed I kept getting dropped offline.  I am using the built in Comcast modem/router which supports 5.0/2.4 Ghz  N connections.  During my troubleshooting efforts I decided to set the router to broadcast a separate 5.0 and 2.4 connection. I connected the Xbox to the 2.4 network and noticed I no longer get dropped offline.  No I'm faced with a slow connection and constantly stuttering gameplay.  

From the research I've done it might benefit me to get a faster router, possibly 802.11AC.  I've read that has great range + fast speeds.  I'm not ready to drop hundreds on a Nighthawk and I'm just looking for someone to guide me.

fpfyu6,ExtasyOfficial,Trouble Streaming Modern Warfare on OBS,"Not sure if anyone else has had/is having this issue, everytime I attempt to stream Modern Warfare with Streamlabs OBS the stream starts dropping frames like a mofo. Every other game I've played on stream (Dota, World of Warships, Overwatch, Apex Legends) works perfectly fine and doesn't affect the stream at all, unless my internet starts acting up (screw Spectrum).

When I'm in the game it's silky smooth at 1080p 75 fps and looks amazing, then I look at OBS and it says I'm dropping a buttload of frames and on twitch it skips 5 seconds at a time. 

My PC is by no means high end as it was a value build but it is very new (4 months). This just isn't in issue in other games and I have been searching for a solution. 

Alright some details. Specs:

Ryzen 2600 cpu

RX 580 8gb gpu

16 gb ddr4 ram

1tb kingston ssd

In game I am running 1080p fullscreen with frames capped at 75fps(my monitors frequency) on medium settings. The bar at the top right indicates I'm only using 1.7gb of vram, so I assume that isn't the issue since the card has 8(also shown top right). I have motion blur(weapon and world) and v-sync turned off. Freesync is activated in Radeon control center because my monitor is compatible, haven't tried turning it off yet. 

In streamlabs I'm outputting 1080p 60fps with a target bitrate of 6000. I'm using the AMD encoder with the ""Twitch Streaming"" priority selected. These setting work perfectly fine in all other games, unless of course Spectrum gets in my way again. Now I tried switching back to CPU encoding the other day and not only would the stream lag, but the game became unplayable as well. 

I can try getting logs when I get home if someone could kindly tell me how, but I'm hoping this issue is less complicated and someone has solved the same problem. Is my GPU simply not strong enough to run this game and stream? Because I'm willing to upgrade given the case. Is it my settings in the game? Is it my settings in Streamlabs?

fpfxxq,Wyevy,"PC won't turn on immediately after a powercut/being turned off at the plug, but will months later.","This is an interesting one, and my main question is will this be a simple case of purchasing a new power supply, or is there something else at fault? (before I spend anything)

A while back (going on 2 years now), my PC overheated and wouldn't turn back on after it turned itself off. I tried changing cables, sockets etc. but nothing would work, so I just thought it was a blown power supply (despite it being fairly new at the time) and used my laptop for a while instead.

Rougly 6 months later I plugged it in when I moved house and it miraculously worked again. However, a little while after, we had a powercut in the house and another issue cropped up: my graphics card appeared to not be working. After tinkering around a bit, it seemed that my old card would work but only with one of the power supply cables (the more recent graphics card required two cables so I assume that one of the cables had broken for some reason.)

A little while after that, I unplugged it from the mains and moved the pc, after which it wouldn't turn on again.

Is this likely to be simply a power supply issue, or is there something else at fault here?

I should note, everytime it wouldn't turn back on, I mean it would spin up and the power button would light up, but nothing else would show up. I would force a power off by holding the button and then nothing would happen at all when pressing the button.",4,1585244632,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpfxxq/pc_wont_turn_on_immediately_after_a_powercutbeing/,techsupport,1

Thanks!

I have two ASUS VS239H-P monitors that started having issues a couple months ago. I had been running them off a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon, connected by USB 3.0 to a Plugable USB 3.0 Dual 4k Docking Station, which was connected to the monitors via two Displayport to HDMI cables. This worked fine and was stable. I then tried connecting the monitors to a Macbook Air via a USB-C to HDMI cable. This worked for a time.

However, when I tried reverting to use the Lenovo + Dock setup, both monitors only display in 640x480 resolution, and do not give me the option of changing resolution. When I attempted to plug the Macbook Air back in, both monitors now no longer recognize HDMI inputs *at all*.

I also tried:  
- Plugging an HDMI cable directly into the Lenovo - both monitors do not recognize this input at all, and the laptop does not detect an external monitor.  
- Plugging an HDMI cable directly into a Macbook Pro - both monitors do not recognize this input at all, and the laptop does not detect an external monitor.  

To trouble shoot this, I have tried:  
- Power cycling the monitors and laptops in various combinations of connected / disconnecting.  
- Using the ""reset"" function on the ASUS onscreen menu.  
- Updating onboards graphic drivers on the lenovo.  
- Swapping out laptops and HDMI cables. I have confirmed the laptops and cables all work by connecting them to my TV.  

I was able today to get the monitors to work at a normal resolution by connecting an HDMI out / DVI in cable to the Lenovo. However, this solution only allows me to use one of the monitors, so it is still not a real fix.",0,1585243201,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpfh5q/repost_asus_vs239hp_monitors_do_not_recognize/,techsupport,1
fpfgcr,TheAquaticRaccoon,Adding RAM cause blue screen,"Hi,

I builded a PC this summer and I put 16GB 3200Mhz Corsair RAM. I set my RAM at 3200Mhz and got no problem. This week, I bought another set of 16GB 3200Mhz Corsair RAM, put those in the empty slots and starting to get a lot of blue screen. The blue screen error is never the same, I got:

* DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL
* IRQL\_NOTLESS\_OR\_EQUAL
* MEMOMY\_MANGEMENT (I don't remember if this is the exact name)
* PAGE\_FAULT\_IN\_NONPAGED\_AREA

Lists of things I have tried in order:

* Moved the new RAM inside the old RAM slots and placed the old RAM into the new RAM slots.
* Updated my BIOS to the recent update.
* Set my RAM at 2933Mhz.

I removed the old RAM and keep only the new, didn't get any blue screen within 4-5 days. I read some RAM aren't compatible, does this apply to same brand, same speed, same timing? What can I try? Thanks

fpffqk,GlitchyAF,Messed up overclocking (I think) and need help with getting my screen on again,"Hey r/techsupport

I am one who likes weiting dreadfully long stories but I’ll save myself and you the effort for once. Long story short, got RDR2, wondered if I could run it at higher graphic settings by overclocking (which I have NEVER done before) and now my pc screen is black or my monitor tells me “out of range!”.

Some more info, I was benchmarking while changing the GPU memory. I had already put the fan turning speed at 60% (14-25 was wat was normal before I started overclocking. The temperature lowered from about 60° to 40°. Then I started tweaking the memory. I was looking for visual tearing and glitches but didn’t seem to find any. Then I might have put the slider up way to fast and way too far (I remember to about 300, this was in afterburner and I don’t recall if it was GHz or MHz and it’s probably making me look stupid but honestly I really don’t know much about computers so I don’t know what is really high or not)

Then the sound from the benchmark glitched a little and the screen turned black. I tried to alt + f4 all the open programs (no idea id this was a smart move) but that didn’t seem to work. Having no idea what to do, as the benchmark music was still playing, I pressed the off button of my physical pc. After booting it up again the screen remained black and occasionally I would see the “out of range!” Message flash by. Plugging my hdmi cable into the motherboard didn’t work, as my monitor couldn’t detect any input.

No idea what to do next, gpu still seems fine but I have no idea if that is actually the case so don’t take my word for it maybe I’ve killed mu gtx 1050 ti without knowing it yet. Could use some tips on how to at least get my screen working again so I can reverse the overclocking.",1,1585243069,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpffqk/messed_up_overclocking_i_think_and_need_help_with/,techsupport,1

fpfez2,The_Munchies10,Internet/WiFi issue persisting on formatted PC.,"Hello, I am having internet issues that has plagued my online gaming sessions for months. Initially, I was having a broadband issue when the router would totally go down and all of my devices would be affected. So I called my ISP and they sent their engineer and resolved the matter. Internet has been running perfectly ever since on all of my devices except for my gaming pc. I have tried everything in my ability to resolve this problem by using Google and it still persisted. So I figured there must be some sort of corruption with the registry or files (or whatever it may be, what do I know) so I have formatted my computer today as the final resort and still availed.

The issue is, before and after formatting my pc, internet goes down whilst still being connected to WiFi on full signal strength. Only way I can reconnect is disconnecting my pc from my router on the network settings and reconnect to it again then it would be working perfectly fine again. Also, it seems like no matter how long I wait, this has to be done in order to reconnect to the internet.

I know there is a problem with this PC spefically because I have been gaming online seperately on my laptop many times with no problem whatsoever. Though my laptop is connected to wifi extender, which connected to the same router that my pc is connected to.",0,1585242999,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpfez2/internetwifi_issue_persisting_on_formatted_pc/,techsupport,1

The screen froze, but I could hear the game still happening in the background.  I force quit the game.  
  
I then restarted the game, played for about 20 more minutes, and my PC crashed to a blue screen.  I failed to notice the stop code.  When it was finished collecting data, my pc went to a black screen.  The monitors were on, but there was no display (it was getting a signal from my GPU, but was nothing to show).  
  
I then shut down completely.  Started it back up, and my mobo splash screen flashed for a second, and then it went to 'No operating system found, press ctrl+alt+del to restart.'

I'm trying to reinstall the xbox app, but every time I attempt to run the installer, the installer locks up.  When I go into the Microsoft Store app and go to downloads and updates, nothing will load.  I can go to the Ori store page on the MS app, but again, nothing happens.

I have an HP Pavilion laptop (probably ab-series, similar to [this model] (https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/HP+Pavilion+15-ab165us+Battery+and+Back+Cover+Replacement/99332) if not the same--i5, Nvidia GEforce, 8g RAM) and since the last Windows 10 update that auto-installed (probably the one on 2/11/20, 18486 if I'm correct) it started having serious issues with hanging, freezing, and crashing. Programs, often Firefox, would freeze up, Task Manager and start menu would become totally unresponsive and sometimes the entire system froze up.

I tried to disable AVG to see if it was causing problems in the background, and *that* also froze up my system. I restarted and attempted to uninstall AVG; it would not uninstall, and this led to a total crash. The drive would turn on and run but the screen was totally black. Eventually I got it to run a DST and got a hard drive error. All attempts at recovery resulted in ""boot device not found"" and ""boot configuration data is missing.""

 I made a bootable USB on my working computer yesterday and was able to access Bios/UEFI and change the boot order with no problems. But after getting past this, I have a flashing/flickering display that did not appear in the UEFI menu. With some trouble I managed to read the screen well enough to reach the installation menu where you choose region/etc, and click ""Next"" but while I can move the cursor and use the keyboard, I cannot click ""Next"" to progress any further. 

Making this computer work, per se, isn't my priority. It's a few years old and I've replaced it. I really only wanted to try accessing command prompt to see if I can recover some files before the last resort of taking the HDD out.

Bunch of speakers and it serves as its own blu-ray player, and you plug your devices into the back, we have two devices plugged in, PS4 and a Directtv box. Directtv box has always worked fine.

But man, the PS4 gets super hateful sometimes, it always shows a purple vertical line on the edge of the screen, and i have to switch the PS4 back to 480p, then back to 1080p again to get rid of it. Looking at it you'd think this was a TV issue but it only happens on PS4. This is only minor though...

Starting yesterday, my PS4 stopped displaying blu-ray discs, when booting a blu-ray, the TV displays NO SIGNAL. Opening the PS4 dashboard while the blu-ray is playing immediately returns the picture. It's only blu-ray's, DVDs, games and tv apps all work. it's only blu-ray's. 

Some notes below

""Why not use the LG blu-ray player?"" Because, I like all in one devices, I can do everything from the PS4, and I got my nice PS4 remote for that, pain to switch to the blu-ray player, just to watch a blu-ray. Even if i wasn't OCD and was willing to do that, i'd still wanna know wtf the issue is here. Plus I was just gonna test it as I typed this to see if it works, and the LG player's blu-ray disc tray refuses to open.

""Trash the home theater system"" Oh believe me, if it were up to me, this piece of shit would go in the fire, but I don't pay the bills in this house, so until the people that do decide to replace it, I gotta try to make it work. This thing's given me grief since the day the people who pay the bills in this house bought it. It keeps getting worse.

""Have you tried switching HDMI ports and cables""? Well... that is on my radar, but the way my entertainment center is setup...massive pain. Wanna get other suggestions, might try it while I wait for responses, but have serious doubts that will work.

Oh and while very rare, the LG system has a habit of randomly crashing and restarting.

fperbt,FilthydelphiaAoK,Microphone Not Working -- Device Not Migrated,"I have a Blue Yeti USB microphone (plug and play) that worked flawlessly for many weeks but recently stopped recording audio entirely. With work and classes going remote now, I am desperate for help! I have a custom-built PC with Windows 10 Home Version 10.018362 and an Asus x99-A motherboard with both 3.0 and 3.1 USB ports.

The microphone *is* recognized by Windows 10 (it shows up in Sounds and in Devices and Printers in Control Panel) and its privacy settings are On for all apps. The USB chord connected to the microphone is fine since the light on the microphone turns on. Unplugging the microphone causes the ""Yeti Stereo Microphone"" to disappear from my devices list in Windows and re-plugging causes it to re-appear so Windows evidently recognizes the device. I have attempted to update drivers (no drivers needed) and uninstalled/re-installed the device (Windows even tells me it is installing the device). Windows insists ""This device is working properly"".

When I select the Microphone in Device Manager and click Events, I see ""Device not migrated"" and the error below:

    Device SWD\MMDEVAPI\{0.0.1.00000000}.{043bfe8a-d18d-4614-975b-075d7dacbd34} was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.

I googled this error and found reams of discussion on Windows support going back to 2016 about many other types of peripherals having this error and no solution. I'm hoping there's something I can do.

Steps I have done:  
\- Tried different USB ports (both 3.0 and 3.1)  
\- Tried my microphone on another PC. Did not work, but the only other PC I have is the same Windows version and this is looking more and more like a Windows problem  
\- Uninstalled/Installed device / checked for updated drivers (it's a plug and play mic)  
\- Updated my BIOS

fper6v,rockythedoggy,Very Weird Mouse Issues," Hello fellow pc gamers, I hope you are all doing well. I am having issues with my mouse or pc, idk which is the problem. If I am playing a shooter game, and I hold down m2 to ads (aim down sight) on my Logitech g403, it constantly stutters, makes me keeps aiming and un-aiming. So I would think my mouse button is broken, even though it is only around 6 months old. I switched to a laser mouse and tested it and it works fine, so I would think that my g403 really is broken. But then, I used the g403 on my gaming laptop and it was fine! Only when I use it on my pc the m2 stutters.  
This issue happens in all shooter games (Battlefield, Rainbow 6 Siege, etc). Weird thing is, it frequently happens only when I am shooting at an enemy. So if I ads then fire at a wall lets say, the ads issue rarely happens. But if I get in a firefight with an enemy, or when there is chaos near me in the game (gunfire, explosions, etc.) it happens more frequently. If I shoot directly at an enemy, it happens almost consistently. Again only happens on my pc, on my laptop, or even my brother's pc my g403 works fine. What can I do to fix it?

I recently bought an external CD reader/writer to burn CDs for my Pioneer CDJs. I bought some blank Philips CD-Rs with them. Whenever I insert them it takes a while trying to read them and ultimately ejects them. When I press DVD RW Drive (G:) it instantly tells me to insert a disc while one is inside already. 

Afterwards I ran to the store and bought some Lifetec premium silver edition CD-Rs which worked perfectly. Since they were 1€ a piece though I ordered another batch by another brand to try those, made by MediaRange. These have the same problem as the Philips ones. 

Anyone have an idea why it won’t read some but will read other blank CDs?

Could it be something with the rest of my setup?,"Had a 2080 for about 8 months when it started showing artifacts out of the blue one morning. White horizontal lines.

Replacement arrives one day before Doom Eternal release and as soon as I placed the part in and turned in the PC I get the very same artifacts albeit they are now green instead of white.

Put the 1080 back in and did a second RMA. I am now waiting for the new card to arrive. It is my understanding that these RMAs are all refurbished cards. Also I should note the first replacement came in a torn antistatic bag.

Is there any possibility that something in my PC is damaging the 2080s?

fpeppv,KarmaElite,New webcam's microphone works on laptop but not desktop,"Today I received a Logitech Streamcam that I recently purchased, and I can't get the microphone to work properly on my desktop. The webcam itself works just fine but the audio is best described as glitchy. I've tried troubleshooting using the built-in Win10 voice recorder, Skype, and Google Hangouts and all result in the same choppy audio. When I plug the webcam into my laptop, a Dell Latitude 5285, everything works perfectly.

I've tried using the drivers automatically installed by Windows 10, downloading the Logitech Capture software, disabling the mic on my headset, boosting levels, scouring the BIOS settings, and upgrading the motherboard BIOS firmware.

Afterwards, I ran my PC and could see that the M.2 drive was in via device manager. However, my wifi was no longer working or showing up at all via the device manager.

Afterwards, I removed my M.2 drive, rebooted, and everything continued working perfectly again (with no M.2 drive connected).

Is there any advice on how to handle this? I do have enough drive space via the 1TB M.2 to take either the SSD or Spinning drive and put them all onto the M.2 (Think both in fact, but then my space would be limited again).

I've got a rig, specs below, that has an unusual issue that only occurs at low loads and when spending long periods of time at idle. The screen goes dark, RGB goes to the board default, and the cooling fans go to 100%. After this occurs, no input will bring the system back online. The only way to get the computer back up is to cut power to PSU, wait 10 seconds, and then restart. Holding the power button has no effect.

Anyone have experience with these symptoms? No recent hardware changes, the first occurrence was noticed during a 3D print via a USB connection to my PC from a new 3D printer. The fact that the PC can't be restarted by holding the power button seems to be a critical clue but I do not know what it means.

fped4z,junee-bugg,ASUS zenbook has been giving me so many issues and geek squad only made it worse,"I can’t go back to geek squad because they’re closed due to the pandemic.

A few months ago my computer started doing this odd thing where it would not charge past 67%. If it was plugged in, it would get to 67% and then just stop charging. I should also add that the computer gets INSANELY hot if I use it while it’s charging, so I never did that. If the battery went low while I was using it and it needed a charge I would have to stop using it because it would literally get burning hot within 5 mins of plugging it in to the charger. 

I will note that I primarily was playing games on origin a lot during this time, which seemed to make these issues worse but even when doing non-game things it would still do this.

I took it into geek squad and they fixed the charging issue. I asked them why it was doing that and they said it needed a major update, which was odd to me because I had only had the laptop for about 6 months. I asked them about the laptop getting really hot and they said that it just happens and to just not use it while it is charging... also weird to me because all previous laptops I owned never had this issue.

So I took it home and now it just crashes ALL the time. I’m not even gaming on it anymore (which is frustrating because that was one of the primary reasons I bought it) because it can’t handle the games without crashing. I only do school work on it now and the extent of programs I use on it is Adobe things like photoshop and illustrator. I realized that If I had a lot of stuff going at once it would crash so I had to just basically have one thing open at a time.

I’ve recently noticed that it tends to crash if I am trying to navigate between things too quickly, even though the computer does not lag and loads everything fairly quickly. Today I had 2 tabs on chrome open and a word doc and it crashed while I was typing. I keep having to start over assignments and constantly save and I don’t know what to do.

When it crashes I get the blue screen and it says it ran into a problem and needs to restart. It usually gives me this error code: DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE

but it also gives different codes sometimes too, the only other one I can remember is: VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR

Other possible useful info: 

- Geek squad also downloaded anti-virus software on it (it is called web root I think? I can’t check because it’s currently crashed.)
- I don’t go on any weird websites or have any weird programs on it, and I essentially just use Origin, Adobe, Google, Microsoft, etc. 

I could really use some help as I have a lot of school work to do and this laptop is making it impossible. I really want to love this laptop because I researched before buying and spent $1300 on it.

fpe67a,deviant324,"GPU at high load constantly hovering 82 degrees, should I consider better cooling?","I’ve been on here last week for a different issue that’s been solved (it was indeed the PSU and I just got my replacement in the mail), but because I’m currently still working on a borrowed PSU my case is currently open since I didn’t put the PSU in, just wired everything temporarily and worked with that for two days.

So since I still had Speccy on my PC as part of my search for the issue I figured this morning that I could check what temps my parts are running at, and it seems like Monsterhunter World is really making my machine work to get the performance I paid for two years ago.

I throttled the graphics and all to medium to get a sort of stable 60 FPS at 1440p going a while ago, but I still occasionally get moments where it feels like my PC is having a stroke, with FPS in the 10s (but only on the Iceborne specific snow map). Could that be due to thermal throttling?

I’ve only discovered the wonders of Event Viewer since my other issues arrose so I’ll only get to check on that in time.

A coworker told me that my air flow might also just be gimped right now because it is open (and frankly has 0 cable management done), so I can see what it’s like after I’ve installer the new old PSU tomorrow.


Current cooling would be 2 fans on the front pannel, open top and upper back side as well as bottom (though bottom cloggs with dust very quickly, my PC is positioned on the ground). Other than that I only have a fan on my CPU cooler, and whatever is on my 1080 (facing downward so with me not being home rn I can’t check). There’s space for one more fan on the back of my case, the sides are completely closed when the case is fully assembled, so the back would be my only option to add more.

Edit: I also don’t have any OC going on other than factory OC. Not sure how much I can do on my fan speeds, don’t think I have any software to do that either",2,1585238976,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpe67a/gpu_at_high_load_constantly_hovering_82_degrees/,techsupport,1
fpe58x,FetchTheGuillotine,Unexplained high RAM-usage?,"So i started notice my PC stuttering, turns out, even right after a fresh restart, my PC uses nearly 27GB RAM right of the bat. Obviously my PC launches some programs on startup, but nothing that explains this.  
First thing i thought of was driver causing memory leakage, as i got a warning the other day that a program crashed due to my graphics driver. I updated my driver in geforce experience, but that did nothing.  
The values  taskmanager show of ram usage don't seem to add up to 28 GB of ram either (haven't acutally added them up manually). I'm currently running a malwarebytes scan, but it will take time as i have quite a lot of storage.

fpe1jv,KingSpoon2,Blinking amber light on laptop battery/AC adapter indicator?,"Hi, I have an HP Elitebook 850 G2 that has an amber light that is constantly blinking regardless of whether or not it's on the charger.

I swapped the battery out recently because my old one was dying at \~30ish percent regardless of what I did. This battery does NOT die early like the other, but it seems to have the indicator on nonstop. From what I can tell, nothing is actually wrong like it usually would be with the indicator. If I understand correctly, the indicator would usually blink if the AC adapter wasn't charging or if there were battery issues. However, I have no problem using the laptop itself. Everything works as it should, but the indicator does NOT turn off at any point. I'm concerned that maybe there's an issue I'm overlooking?

I'm almost certain this battery is a knockoff as most are off Amazon. When I run battery check through HP diagnostics it says Logic State: No AC Power and charge state: not available. So, it's definitely not picking up charge cycles as it would with my other battery. I'm ASSUMING that the indicator blinks orange nonstop because the battery is counterfeit/knockoff and it just won't recognize it as a legitimate product, but maybe there's something else I'm overlooking? Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Also, if there's a reputable place where you can get legitimate laptop batteries, I'd greatly appreciate any references.",0,1585238574,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpe1jv/blinking_amber_light_on_laptop_batteryac_adapter/,techsupport,1

I have bought a brand new monitor which works fine with my laptop (MacBook 2018 13"" over USB-C to HDMI adapter), but throws resolution issues with my gf's laptop.

   * connected via HDMI cable (tested several, also the one that I am successfully running 3440x1440 over, so this shouldn't be the issue).

Additional checks performed:

* Drivers --&gt; all up to date, including BIOS update
* HDMI cable --&gt; tried several without success
* Tried all windows builtin menus without success

I could not find any information, which HDMI version the laptop uses. As far as I know the HDMI standard needs to be at least HDMI 1.4 to support the desired resolution. Please correct me if I'm wrong. HDMI 1.4 was introduced in 2009 and the laptop is from 2017, so I suppose it has HDMI 1.4.

I can't think of any reason why it just won't work. Does anyone have an idea? Last option would be to (unfortunately) sell the monitor and try another one.

fpdydj,TheMantis17,"Laptop powers up for about 3 seconds, stops, turns off- screen lights up, but I never receive video","Last night I was using it like normal and it just turned off. After this, it’s exactly what I described, although maybe closer to 1.5-2 seconds.

I have tried removing the battery and just using the AC adapter, no dice there, so it’s not a dead battery.

My current theory is that the AC adapter is actually dead, but the weird thing is the charger light is green, meaning that the computer thinks the battery is full. It’s orange when not full and charging.

I tried booting it up while hooked up to a TV via HDMI, because I had heard of failed displays causing crashes. No change there either.

Thoughts anyone?

Yesterday, I opened it up (it's a DELL Desktop Optiplex 390), switched up the RAMs (2x 2GB DDR3) and removed my video card (NVIDIA GeForce GT710) to remove the battery.  
Did that, closed it and turned it on, and everything was working fine. I was able to work, play ETS2, ATS, Dolphin Emulator, etc.  


Today, had to the same steps, but instead it asked to run the DELL Diagnostics tool. By doing that, I got the following:

**Validation: 115053**  
**Msg: Hard Drive 1 - S/N WD-WX51A61S5682, incorrect status = 3E**  
**SMART Predictive Failure**

My main issue with that is that I got this PC back in 2018, with a 250GB HDD that died. I then got a 128GB SSD with an 500GB HDD, and the HDD is once again giving me issues.  
Back in 2019, I had the same issue of trying to turn on and then the PC turning off by itself (it keeps doing that on a loop until I remove the power cable), that then resulted on the old HDD dying and me getting the current setup I have.

fpdpiy,lIIIllIIIII,WiFi gets disconnected randomly,"I bought an HP pavilion laptop in December this year. The laptop came with a intel wireless ac 9560 160 mhz network adapter. Ever since I opened it up, the WiFi was dropping randomly. No specific intervals. Nothing. I put up with it for a while and then this month, I lost it and since the laptop was under warranty I got them to check it out and had the laptop sent to customer support. To give you a little bit of background:

1. Yes, all other devices connected to the WiFi are operational.

2. Yes, I updated all drivers before sending it in. Uninstalled and installed the driver and all that fun stuff.

3. Power management for the adapter was also adjusted.

4. All windows updates were run and updated.

All of this was before sending the laptop in to Customer Care. I got the laptop back last week and they have replaced the network adapter with realtek rtl8822be 802.11ac pcie adapter. And the problem persists. 

1. My initial reaction was that there was something wrong with my router - I use a super old one - Netgear router WNR1000v4. But here's the thing:

a. My 10 year old laptop and all other devices connected to it seem to work OK.

b. My work laptop which I'm using WFH also connects to the same router just OK. I will have to admit that I have randomly lost WiFi on the work laptop as well but much much much lesser times than I have on my personal one. That is also an HP laptop but with an intel network adapter.

The problem with the current adapter seems to be two fold: the internet will slow down randomly (not shut off) but will shut off and become absolute shit when I disconnect the power supply and run off of a battery. Yes, I have already adjusted the power management to use the max performance on battery for the wifi adapter.

I am considering buying a new router before getting back to the customer support but I was wondering if there is something that I'm missing.",0,1585237425,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpdpiy/wifi_gets_disconnected_randomly/,techsupport,1

fpdjvq,LifeSelector_,"Wanting to decompile an .exe, edit it and compile it again","Hi there,

I've been trying to edit an .exe file.

However I used DotPeek to decompile it, found the part of the code that needed to be edited (in C# btw).

And now ive edited the code via notepad++ and I want to compile it again.

Here's where the fun began, Visual Studio gives me more than 150 errors when trying to build/rebuild and if I try DNspy it also gives me the same errors.  
So I thought maybe it is the way I edited the code, after decomping and then instantly recomping still the same issues occoured.

I would love some help and or suggestions about maybe different tactics or software

fpdjra,Relapsii,High CPU temperatures and RAM usage on idle,"Hello, so lately I've noticed that my ram usage was pretty high, I have 10gb ram and when I just stay on the desktop with no program on, something is consuming +-50% of the ram. I looked into task manager and there's 5gb in use but I can't find anything that's using it. I also noticed my cpu temperatures are really high - 60C also on idle and its spiking all the time. When I turn the pc on it just goes on full 100% usage for a little while. Weirdly though when I game it doesn't go much up, it just sits around 75C. That brings me to another problem that may be caused by this, the computer takes very long time to quit, its staying on the turning off windows screen for like 2 mins, same with restarting, before it took 2 seconds. Also accompanying these problems are pretty frequent freezes, not BSOD I never get any blue screens, the pc just freezes completely and I need to restart it manually. I've tried reseating the heatsink and ram but didn't help, also tried new windows install but without any data removal (don't wanna reinstall my games), also didn't help. If a clean windows install could fix this all then I shall try.

fpdf83,wobbitisping1337,FPS drops and high temps," 

**Before:**

When I'm gaming on my laptop, I experience these weird random FPS drops, the problem is, I know I can run the games I am playing. For example, when I'm playing Morrowind or Enter The Gungeon, the FPS is perfectly fine, and then after about 20-30 minutes in my session, I experience these bad FPS drops that make the game lag insanely. Then after 2-3 minutes the FPS returns to normal, and I keep playing, then the FPS drops come back again, and this keeps on repeating and it makes it really hard to game.

**Here are my Specs:**

**CPU:** AMD Ryzen 3 2200u

**GPU:** AMD Vega 3 Integrated Graphics w/2 GB VRAM

**RAM:** 6 GB (it says 2gb usable tho idk why) (apparently there's also 3 gb of usable virtual RAM)

**OS:** Windows 10

**Storage Space:** 900 GB HDD, with about 100 GB used

**Now:**

I got the Lenovo Ideapad L340 a couple of months ago, and everything went smoothly, then while I was playing Fallout New Vegas, the laptop crashed a bunch of times, and the game started lagging hugely, even Half Life started lagging as well. I updated the BIOS, but the problems still persisted after that. Then, I went to the BIOS and turned to CPU performance down to the most balanced option, to limit how hot it gets. Everything seemed to work fine after that. Fast forward to yesterday, I was playing some Roblox, (don't judge), and it ran at 60 FPS for about 1 hour and 30 min, then the FPS dropped to about 5 -10 FPS, and my ping went to about 500. Then it just went back to normal, the little FPS drops just kept happening for about 30 seconds at a time. I shut down the laptop then started it up again and it was fine, but then I played some more and it started happening again. It only seems to be happening when I'm gaming.

But still, even now when I have 5 tabs open in Google and watch a youtube video, the temps just jump up to about 89 degrees Celsius, so I'm really worried since I don't know what's causing my laptop to heat up so much. Even when I'm not gaming, the temps seem to be really high.

Is there a way to disable thermal throttling or undervolt my CPU, because I think that will help, but I just came to see if there are any other ways to fix this.

Since I first built it, I replaced the GPU, CPU &amp; Motherboard to a MSI GeForce GTX 1070, Gigabyte GA-Z97MX-Gaming 5 (rev. 1.0) &amp;  Intel i7-4790K. Has been working fine for a while, but there's some old components in there.

When I was first playing it, it was fine for about an hour or two, then crashed, rebooted a few times, then fine for another hour. I thought it was a RAM problem so I booted into MemTest and tried different combinations, all of them eventually rebooted after 1-2 hours, or as soon as 5-10 mins.

A few days later, it's doing this:

[https://streamable.com/yn4k8](https://streamable.com/yn4k8)

I took out the GPU and disconnected the hard drives in case it was the power supply, but that's made no difference. I even took out the RAM hoping that it would beep (I remember old mobos doing this, idk if they still do), but it made no difference.

I think it must be the motherboard that's cooked. I'm happy to order a new one, but I was wondering if there's any other test I can do to narrow it down?

As an aside, if I do get a new motherboard, can I get something that's compatible with the current CPU &amp; RAM, or should I just upgrade that as well? Thanks for any help!",0,1585236415,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpdelk/reboot_loop_every_few_seconds/,techsupport,1

fpd93n,matteodream,ryzen 3600 on x370-f strix Motherboard voltage,"Hello, I'll start saying sorry for my english :)  
Anyway, brand new ryzen 5 3600, coming from 2600.

I've got a custom loop with double rads, one 360 and one 240. 1070ti also liquid-cooled.  
My 2600 was running happily at 4.15 with 1.38-1.39 vcore. Idle temp or while browsing was between 30 and 40c° max, load temp on cinebench just under 70c°, perfectly stable with ram at 3600, tight timings.

I was really happy with my results, days at testing results in good performance.  
I swapped my 2600 with 3600 (I'm on the latest bios), cmos reset and I left all on auto except for memory XMP profile.

logging into windows I noticed my fan ramping high ""too much"", temp where 50-55c° loading windows and, in idle condition, they won't go lower than 48-46c°. In hwinfo I noticed vcore and single-core voltages almost constantly at 1.4 or more.

I tried everything, I can get almost the same performance fixing vcore at 1.35 and in that case temperatures are actually better than my 2600. If I set anything lower than 1.35 I can get better all core frequency on cinebench than stock but a substantially lower score (???).

In other threads I saw the vcore on bios set to ""normal"" instead of ""auto"" but I don't have that option and strangely with the 3600 a new page appeared in bios, with ram timings setting and PBO (it's on the secondary settings page, where you change drive settings, pci-ex and usb stuff. If you click on it you must accept the AMD disclaimer for overclocking and then the new page open), if I change something in this section it appears that nothing happens, tried with ram timings, the main page for overclocking works fine but still, I don't get it. I can basically change timings, ram voltages and PBO in two sections with options that are almost the same but literally written in a different manner. very strange.

anyway, I tried also setting s4 and s5 state (I don't have ""amd cool'n'quiet option), high-performance energy profile on windows, balanced, lowering Vcore setting to a negative offset, but nothing changes the high voltages and temp, only fixing the voltage at 1.35 but I don't think this is the right way to have the best overall performance and make PBO works as it should.  
with PBO and ""auto"" vcore my CPU on cinebench requires 180w, with 1.35 and PBO it doesn't go higher than 140w. This is why I'm going crazy trying to understand this.

it's just my motherboard or am I missing something? or is it totally normal? the voltages can go lower yes, but they stay almost constantly at 1.4 or more resulting in very high idle temps and I don't get why I have so much higher idle temps than my stretched overclock on 2600.

and please don't just respond ""leave it all stock"", I've been in pc's world since 1998 and always overclocked stuff, for fun and for science :D",0,1585235891,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpd93n/ryzen_3600_on_x370f_strix_motherboard_voltage/,techsupport,0

fpd1e1,CakeDayOrDeath,Error Message at Startup,"Reposting because I didn't get any replies, probably because I posted in the middle of the night. 

I have a laptop running Windows 10.

Since yesterday, when I've been booting up the laptop, I get a blue screen that says ""ERROR Verification Failed (15) Access Denied"" with an ""OK"" button below. When I click the ""OK"" button, my computer continues to boot up and otherwise behaves normally.

I have tried the advice from Microsoft to do a hard restart; it didn't help. The other piece of advice I have found is to turn off Secure Boot.

My questions:

1. What does this error mean?
2. Do I need to address it? As in, will anything happen down the line that's worse than a scary-looking message at startup?
3. My SO recently helped me turn on virtualization in BIOS, and I started getting this error message when I booted up the computer after he did that. Is it a coincidence?
4. I recently started and didn't complete an installation of an Android Emulator that was supposed to dual boot Android. Could *this* be related to the error message?
5. My hard drive is getting close to the end of its lifespan. Could *that* be related to the error message?

The problems started at first with the battery dying faster and faster, then started to die on me randomly. It would be at any percent and die on me. When it wouldn't randomly die, it would restart itself over and over without me being able to do anything about it until it stopped acting up. What really caused me to get a new one, was when the phone started to play audio for no reason. Strangely, this would only happen at night, and only happened for a few nights and then it stopped. What the phone would do was this: It would be working fine, but then the screen would just randomly turn balc despite what it was or wasn't doing. Then audio would play, and it could be anything. The audio would last for a few minutes then stop, and when it stopped, my phone would die as if it had no more battery life, despite it being connected to a charger. I only have memories of what the audio was (these events happened a bit over a year ago), but one I do remember was 2 men talking. I thought it was my dream at first, but when I woke up I realized that it was coming from my phone, but by the time I got to it it already died. When I checked it the next morning, there were no records of anything being played, not youtube, netflix, or any new google searches. I didn't have spotify the either, so I know it wasn't that.

Recently, my graphics card started making weird noises. While using the pc, noises just start randomly, not just while gaming. I thought it is the fan, because it can't be nothing else. I opened the card, cleaned it, reasembled it and started the pc. After that the noises appeared the moment I turned on the pc. I separated the fan and in it put an appliance oil that is also used for shavers. After that the fan didn't start spinning at all. There wasn't any noise so it was confirmed it was the fan.
Does someone have an advice for how to start the fan spinning and fix the noise if it continues? Could it be the oil I put bothering the contacts between the fan and the rotor or something? Should I dry it and put something else in it?

Things I've tried.

• Switched the RAMs around.
• Had my tech buddy to see if anything came lose (although I'm not sure if me moving the PC has anything to do with the problem but my friend said nothing is lose and is stumped with what the problem could be).

So I have been stumped lately as I cannot seem to get any microphones working on my desktop device. I've been working from home and have to switch over to my laptop everytime I need to take a call so its been a little more annoying lately.

I have tried everything that I can think of:

\- Re-installing Realtek Audio Software/Driver

\- Changing settings inside Realtek Audio Software

\- Front AND Back panel inputs (for the headset)

\- Bluetooth headset

\- USB microphone

\- Updating BIOS

\- Updating ALL drivers

I cannot think of another step that I can troubleshoot and I cant really seem to find any information online that pertains to my situation, and the only information or posts I have found have solutions that don't fix the problem.

All 3 of these devices work and have been tested working on other devices. The weird thing is that windows DOES recognize that a microphone is plugged in, and the device is ENABLED. For the headset, sound even does play through so I am just honestly stumped on what could have happened.

I did re-image windows a little over a year ago and I don't remember if microphone inputs were working previously, but I don't understand how windows sees the microphone (all 3 I have tried), has them enabled, lets me select them, but they just, don't work.

The current setup of my machine:

\- MSI Z270 A Pro Motherboard

\- Intel i7 7700k

\- Windows 10 Pro 64-bit

fpcs3x,VikkiSims,My Lenovo AC adapter makes a buzzing sound every 1-2 seconds when it's plugged in into my laptop. Is this something to worry about?,"Before I say anything more I want to say (and apologise) in advance, English is my 3rd language. I'm sorry if I say something wrong! 

So I have this 2 years old laptop (Lenovo Legion Y530-15ICH) that has always had a noisy charger (135W, Output: 20V 6.75A), it can get very loud if it's plugged in and my laptop runs some heavy program - like photoshop or a game. It also gets quite hot when plugged in, and makes a long buzz when I unplug it that gradually becomes higher and higher in pitch, then it goes silent after a few seconds. I always found it odd but it worked fine, I assumed it's just what it's like.

Now I noticed that every few seconds it makes a buzz. It's like a sparkle of electricity. It's very short and very quiet, I have to hold my ear close to hear it, but I'm pretty sure it gets louder and louder the longer it's been plugged in and the hotter it gets. I don't know if it did this before and I just didn't notice it, but it's quite new to me. I don't even have to run any heavy programs, it just happens. It only happens when it's plugged in and charging my laptop - it can be plugged in into an outlet but not be plugged into my laptop and it'll be completely silent. 

I tried to unplug the wire that connects to the box (brick? the body of the charger?) thinking that it might be loose and it doesn't connect properly, but nope, it's still making the sound after I plug it back in.

I'm worried that this is dangerous but I'm not sure if I can get anyone to look at it because of the pandemic, and I don't know much about elecricity and electronics. Can anyone help me with this?

fpc9ux,ShabranigdoT,How to resolve a possible GPU thorttling issue at low temp on laptop,"I have a ThinkPad P53S which I use it for light gaming. The specifications are as below

Intel i7 - [8565U@1.8GHz](mailto:8565U@1.8GHz)

16 GB RAM

Nvida Quadro P520/Intel UHD Graphics 620

The gaming I currently play is Divinity Original Sin, which runs on Quadro P520. After a simple research, I beleive P520 has sufficeint power to run this game smoothly. 

I run this game mostly at 1600x900 at graphic setting of High or Ultra. The game alway starts with FPS around 40 - 60, and with the framrate dropping to below 20 FPS after been running for 30 - 60 seconds. From there the framrate varies widly from 60 to single digit FPS. I tried running the game at both lower and higher resolutoin, but this issue presist. 

I used MSI Afterburner and GPU-Z to monitor the Quadro P520 performance during the gaming. It turns out P520 severly downclocks itself when the temperature hit 56C /132F. Sometimes the clock speed is reduced to 100 MHz, making the FPS drop to a single digit range. P520 has a base clock speed of 1300 MHz, and during the game, it rarely hits the speed. 

It seems P520 throttles at 56 C which is way to low for a throttling temperature even for a laptop GPU in my understanding. 

I have it tested under both Power Plans of Balanced and High Performance. And this GPU throtting issue is always there. 

Can someone give me an idea of how to resolve this issue ?Any adivce is highly appreciated. 

Here is the \[GPU status\]( [https://imgur.com/gallery/XxxqA0d](https://imgur.com/gallery/XxxqA0d) ) recored during gaming by GPU-Z.  The GPU-Z screen shot during gaming. You can see the GPU clcok speed varies a lot and the PerfCap (Performance Cap) reason is thermal (temperature limit) as indicated by GPU-Z in Magenta bars. 

 Here are \[in-game footage\]( [**https://youtu.be/rYoaNmH2INw**](https://youtu.be/rYoaNmH2INw) ) recorded by MSI Afterburner. You can see how FPS drops synchronize with GPU downclocking when the temperature hit 56 C /132F .",0,1585232382,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpc9ux/how_to_resolve_a_possible_gpu_thorttling_issue_at/,techsupport,1

fpbrme,iamnotreallytheop,It seems that some of my drivers disappeared?,"The sequence of events that happened to me today is kind off weird but here it goes...

When I first opened my computer, I noticed that the GPU is not working. I'm using a TV as my monitor with an HDMI connection connected to my GPU. What happened is a blank screen with a ""no signal"" message on my TV, I quickly fixed it by switching the HDMI connection from my GPU to the Motherboard.

So then it worked! But noticeably in my desktop, the NVIDIA drivers were missing. My initial thought is that the GPU might not have worked for some reason? So I shutdown my computer, opened the case, and made sure that the GPU is connected in my Motherboard.

After that, I connected my HDMI to my GPU and opened the computer again, the weird thing happened. The BIOS said that it is corrupted and started (at least attempted) to update the corrupted files, fine by me. However, while updating the files which has a warning message ""Do not shut down your computer"", the computer shutted down by itself at around 17%. I started the computer again, and it did booted up, however, I noticed that I do not have internet connection and the Intel Graphics option (when you right click on desktop) is missing!

So I started looking for the drivers on the Device Manager and found out that the drivers seems to be missing. Tried to click View&gt;Show Hidden Devices, and I found them, however when you open the driver, it shows a Code 45: Hardware not connected to the computer.

What I did after the problem:

1. Do a sfc /scannow, which found some corrupted problems, rebooted it, still the same problem.
2. I can't update the driver because my Network Adapter driver is missing, so I have no internet connection on my computer. There is also noticeably no light coming at the back where you plug in the adapter for the network.
3. I did a Windows Reset, where it would reset your settings without touching your personal files. It did not work. However!! When I checked the Device Manager, even viewing with Hidden Devices, the drivers for my Intel Graphics and Network Adapter is now gone.
4. I can't find an option in BIOS about network adapters or graphics. I did reset everything to default, but there's no noticeable change.
5. I did tried to reformat, but as far as I can remember, it tells me that the driver is locked for some reason, and I can't proceed. I might check again tomorrow.

Really hoping that this is not a faulty hardware...",1,1585230447,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpbrme/it_seems_that_some_of_my_drivers_disappeared/,techsupport,1
fpbqq9,itisaBIGsecret,Samsung Smart TV with sound but only blue screen on HDMI,"Hi Helpful Redditors!

After logging into Netflix for the first time in who knows how long to watch Tiger King, I tried getting back to normal cable, which is my HDMI source and it gives me sounds but no video. I can only see a blue screen. I’m convinced I pushed a button when I sat on my remote.

It is worth saying that I have my cable box hooked to a transmitter so that I can have the cable box hidden across the room from the TV. 

I have done so many things to try to fix this. Including:
- Self Picture Test (all good)
- Unplugging and replugging all cords I can reach 
- Resetting my cable box
- Resetting the entire TV

Any other ideas? I can see picture and hear sound totally fine on the other inputs, it’s just this one.",0,1585230350,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpbqq9/samsung_smart_tv_with_sound_but_only_blue_screen/,techsupport,1

fpbqlu,zigtuary,WFH - Computer Extremely Slow Intermittently,"Hello, I'm requesting your expertise in helping me solve this.

I began working from home for the first time last week. Since then, I have noticed extreme lagginess intermittently. This slowness will affect even my local computer, such as moving or minimizing a window, opening a file, etc., not just Internet-related tasks. I am using a VPN to connect to a work server, but I have tried disabling the VPN as well as even my internet connection, and it seems the lagginess will still occur, though less frequently. On the VPN, it occurs every few minutes and lasts for a couple of minutes. I have a wired Internet connection; my IPS markets speeds of 75 mbps.

Can you help me troubleshoot this? I've played around in perfmon and event viewer but haven't found any good leads. My guess is it's related to antivirus software or some other background task. However, task manager shows no spikes in CPU or Network when these lagging episodes occur. I would probably not be able to download any software to diagnose the problem as this is a work computer unfortunately. Also wondering if upgrading my Internet speed would help at all.

I built a computer around christmas with the following parts:
Ryzen 5 3600x (200$)
Asus TUF X570 plus motherboard (180$)
Trindent z neo 3600mhz 2x8 gb (120$)

EVGA rtx 2070 super xc (530$)
Corsair rm750 blacklabel psu (130$)
TP-link gigabit pci express network adapter (10$)
Razer mouse and keyboard
Msi monitor
Some things have happened since putting it together so ill describe everything as much as i can. Everything went together correctly except i had to move my ram sticks to slots 2 and 4 and the gpu to the second bottom slot for my air cooler was massive. I also tried turning it on a few times without the atx cables plugged into the motherbee (face palmed) fixed it and it ran to boot fine, friend whos been pc gaming for over 15 years was over and helped me get os running with starter essentials apps and everything was ok, until i dimwittedly opened my bios one day to see what the oc features of it were and notices that my ram was only running at 2133 mhz default setting. So I manually switched it to 3600 mhz thinking that was all it would take, stupidly, without changing the dram voltages or fclck. It wouldnt run to boot after just the orange light on the motherboard and all the fans roaring, so i had to take out the gpu the hit the CMOS reset switch to fix. Ran everything on normal and let bios update through internet and then reset my computer and tried downloading everything again through armoury crate and ai suite 3, along with the drivers online for gpu and X570. Then every worked well again for a month or so till my fps for all my games dropped dramatically, friend said to look at my bios so i did and hit save and exit without changing anything then it HAPPENED AGAIN, the orange light with roaring fans, I was stuck on boot. Took out gpu again hit the switch updated bios from internet and got it to os screen again but it was fucked, i had to reset pc all over again. I changed my air cooler to a water recently so i could move my gpu to slot 1 (out of the way of the reset switch) and my ram sticks to slots 1 and 3, and saw immediate improvement in pc, no crashes for 24 hours all games full fps. The next morning my pc now crashes right after os loads and i cant even open start tab. Like a big grey square pops up were all the options should be but its blank. And theres always a loading circle around the mouse so i cant troubleshoot. Is it that I did damage to my dram or could it be something worse? What do you guys think?

fpbjh4,somedifferentguy,Can't start Windows 10 anymore: PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA,"Hey,

**Current situation:**

so right now I cannot boot up my Windows 10 anymore on my Desktop PC since it always shows up this BSOD. What I can do, however, is using the blue rescue windows 10 thingy to get into command line or I can also successfully boot into safe mode and do stuff there.

**What I did before getting this BSOD:**

Yesterday I switched the cables from one of my HDDs to my bluray drive as I wanted to watch a BR movie again. Now, this HDD is also the one where I stored my windows page file and when rebooting, windows mentioned that in a popup window. I cannot remember what it said as I closed it instantly (thought it wouldn't be that important).

After switching back and forth between the bluray drive and the HDD, at one point I could not boot anymore and since then I'm getting this BSOD with this ""PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA"" message.

Like I said, I can boot into safe mode but I don't really know what to do there. Right now my HDD is plugged in again and the page file is also set to this HDD, nowhere else. I mean, I'm not even sure this is about the page file but a little Google search suggested that this might be a good candidate to try since my RAM should work perfectly and I did absolutely nothing about them memory chips.

**Stuff I tried:**

* chkdsk /f in safe mode with reboot but did not change anything
* sfc /scannow stopped at 37% and then it said that it found damaged files which could not be repaired partly. The CBS protocole file is here: https://pastebin.com/6Gmjrtq7

Some of the keys I use the most are starting to show problems. The biggest one is the W key. When I press it, it goes too low and usually stays there. I tried removing the keycap but didn't find the problem and don't want to remove the rubber underneath for fear of making things worse.

The keyboard I have is the MK Plus Ultra Compact.

fpb8k9,mofloo,Oddly behaving GPU,"Hello!

So since, about 6 months, back my GPU has been acting up in the most irritating ways I must say.   
*(so bad that I will have a ritual to destroy it once replaced, making sure every molecule of it has left this world)*  


Either way, my problem is simple. I want to play one single game, and that game alone. CS:GO  
Launching the game works absolutely fine, menus and everything. But once a match is found and the loading screen is finished my GPU crashes and I have to manually restart my PC. Somtimes, if the moon is high and the wind is still, I can play a full 90min match without any FPS issues or something like that. I used to play this game frequently, but ever so often it started crashing the GPU. Nowdays it's a 99% certain the GPU will crash once the loading screen is done.  


This is an ancient game, and the **FRUSTRATING** part is that I can play MORE demanding titles - without any problems at all.

So down to business, this is a quick peak over my system:

* **i3-4170 @ 3.7GHz**
* **GTX 660 Ti**
* **8GB DDR3 1033MHz**

What I've tried to solve this issue:

* Dismantle and clean the GPU out of dust
* Re-install numerous amount of drivers (different versions, from the latest to the oldest, some in the middle etc etc)
* Launch CSGO with different settings, from my native resolution to 800x600 with every setting at the lowest possible. I tried launching it in OpenGL.
* Re-installed the game

I've done most things I can do during these past 6 months to make this game work.

*CSGO has the following system requirements:*

* *Intel C2D E6600 / AMD Phenom X3 8750*
* *2GB ram*
* *256MB DirectX 9 supported GPU with Pixelshader 3.0 (they do not list any card)*

# To add insult to injure, 

As I mentioned briefly in the start, I can run more demanding games without experiecing any issue with FPS or crashing at all - over play periods as long as 6 hours non-stop. Some examples of these games are; DOTA2, Apex Legends, Path of Exile, Quake Champions *(this one can cause FPS drops at times though, nothing but expected)*

[Apex Legends System requirements](https://i.imgur.com/kDbFLbK.png)

[Quake Champions System requirements](https://i.imgur.com/iGuBzkk.png)

[Path of Exile System requirements](https://i.imgur.com/Xhw13G6.png)

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm wondering, do anyone out there, actually have the slighest idea to why CS:GO alone would trigger this crash on an almost permanent basis? I understand, that to some degree my GPU is faulty. But why is this game alone the one suffering from it?

Do I just have to give up and buy a new GPU to be able to play CS:GO while all my other games currently work?",2,1585228253,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fpb8k9/oddly_behaving_gpu/,techsupport,1

I like to try and help out on here when I have the time, but today I need to get to the bottom of this issue I am having and I hope someone here has come across this before.

I have a Blue Snowball mic plugged in to my machine via USB and have adjusted the level to about 50 percent in Windows and ensured that under the advanced tab of the device I unchecked the box that allows applications exclusive access.

Now if I save this and talk into it a bit everything is fine and the levels remain the same. However. If I jump into a call with the softphone provided by work (it has no way of adjusting mic sensitivity) or alternatively if I jump in a discord call it increases the microphone volume.

My end goal is to have this set at 50 percent and if I see fit I can adjust for a particular application as I see fit.

I have also gone to the communication tab on the sound control panel and selected 'Do nothing'.

The closest I got to fixing the issue was by running the AMD auto detect program. The program removed my current AMD Radeon R5 graphic driver, then before it reinstalled it, the screen didn't stutter at all. After it had reinstalled the driver, the stutter began again.

I opened the Radeon Software, and clicked on the performance tab, and every time I move the mouse, the screen stutters and the GPU spikes up to 100%.

As mentioned in the title, I booted up into safe mode, and the stuttering stops completely.

Any ideas on what could be causing this? I'm bored in isolation and in need of a working laptop!

fpa7pd,TrueBuckeye,Help! My PC isn't putting out video. I've replaced the video card and still nothing. (details and specs inside),"My background: I used to be into PC building, gaming, and overclocking a lot some 15 years ago, but have become a filthy casual over the years. I still build a new PC every few years, but generally go mid-range and stay away from anything that risks stability for performance.

This issue has been growing for some time. When playing games like Civ VI, Pillars of Eternity II, or Rocksmith 2014 (none of them are crazy graphics) the computer would lock up, video would go out, and it would give out a single loud tone that would go on for about 30 seconds unless the system was hard rebooted first. This would happen once a week, then once a day, then hourly. 

Event logs showed no errors other than an unexpected reboot. Looking at system temps nothing seemed to be out of the norms. 
System specs:

OS is Windows 10

Motherboard is an ASRock H97 Pro 4

CPU is an Intel i5 4590

Video card is XFX Radeon RX 570

PSU is SeaSonic 650w

Then Tuesday the computer video wouldn't turn on. Troubleshooting steps:

 -- Hard reboot, no help

-- Tried a different monitor, no help (also tried the existing monitor on another system, it worked)

-- Tried a different HDMI cable, no help

-- Tried a VDI cable, no video

-- Tried the built in HDMI on the motherboard, nothing

-- Tried the built in VDI on the motherboard, nothing

-- Tried the VGA video on the motherboard with an ancient monitor... IT WORKED

-- With this information, I figured the video card was bad. Time for an upgrade! I picked up a Radeon RX 5600 XT yesterday, but it isn't helping at all. 

So what's next? I guess the motherboard could have died, but I'm not looking forward to dropping cash on a motherboard/cpu combo which may also involve needing new compatible RAM. Is there anything else I should investigate before the motherboard?

fp9x9g,Skip2k,Wrecked two Mainboards and CPUs,"I probably need help to understand what happened.

The story:

Yesterday I got a customers PC for a hardware upgrade to make it run Windows 10 together with our companies software. We do not have any pc techs, so I got the job because I felt comfortable with it. 

We remove the old hardware and only reuse the case. The hardware we use is nothing special. We need RAM, CPU,  Mainboard and a SSD. PSU if it's necessary. 

I already did this a lot so I thought this time would work just fine too.

We get the parts from a local pc repair shop after we tell him what the hardware should be capable of.


I assembled everything, put it in the case, plugged in the psu on the Mainboard and the CPU and the power switch cable. 

Pressed the button to see if it would boot. I smelled something immediately and turned it off. Now I was worried. I removed the cables and searched for the mistake I made. 

But I did not found anything. I took out the CPU and already saw the pins of the socket. They where not exactly bent but not in place anymore because it looks like something melted a bit in the socket. 

The backside of the CPU had burn marks on the pins on the same spot where the pins of the socket where burned. 


I tried the CPU on another Mainboard for testing and it turned off immediately after turning it on. So the CPU is shorted I guess. I cannot use the Mainboard like this anymore and put the parts away. 


When I used another Mainboard with CPU that would be thrown away in the customers casing, it booted just fine. 

To be sure I changed the PSU. I took the new parts and started anew. I put everything together, put it in the case, plugged in the PSU to the Mainboard and CPU again. 

Pressed the power button and smelled it again. Something burned... 

And like the CPU before, the new one had burn marks on the very same pins. The new Mainboard had burned pins on the exact same spot like the one before. 


I do not want to trash another set of parts before I haven't figured out what's going on there. 


Tested another Mainboard in the casing and everything worked just fine. 


For reference, the parts I used;

Biostar H110MHV3 
Intel Pentium G5400 Gold
Corsair DDR3 RAM 4GB 1333


Like I mentioned before, I'm not a trained PC technician, so I might not understand if I made a mistake. 

But it's also not my first time doing this. It went fine everytime. 

I can understand why I would make a mistake once. But it happened twice, and it turned out the exact same way like the first try I did with this parts. 


Does somebody recognise this kind of behaviour? I mean the way those pins where burned, could it be something specific? 

I am thankful for every suggestion. We cannot bring the parts to a pc tech right now because of the corona virus. Those stores are closed right now.",0,1585222079,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp9x9g/wrecked_two_mainboards_and_cpus/,techsupport,1

fp9wxk,Necrogamer6389,"Computer has started stuttering frequently. After more than 2 weeks of troubleshooting, I believe I've narrowed the issue down to my GPU. I have some questions regarding this.","Main point of this post at bottom.

This is a Skytech Shadow II gaming desktop. I've only had it for about a month and a half now, I've had the issue for over two weeks, coming up on 3.

Specs
OS - Windows 10
RAM - 16gbs
Processor - AMD Ryzen 7 2700 8 core 3.2ghz
64 bit system
Graphics - Nvidia RTX 2060 6gb GDDR6
Motherboard - B450M
SSD - 500gb ssd2

I noticed while playing Divinity OS2, that every 5-10 seconds, my game would freeze for about 2-3 seconds, then would resume like normal until it froze again. I initially did the basic things; restart the game, then the computer, cleared up some memory, ran troubleshooter and antivirus programs, and none of these worked. After that, I turned to Google for help, and proceeded to try every bit of advice I could find. This includes, uninstalling GPU drivers and reinstalling them up to date, soft and hard format of the hard drive, command prompt chkdsk, disabled the dynamic tick, disabled the diagnostic policy service, disabled the windows game bar,  uninstalled the two most recent Windows updates, and I know there's more I tried but that's all I can remember.

The last thing I've done, is emailed Skytech about the situation, and told them I thought it was an SSD issue, to which they agreed and sent a replacement. I received the replacement and installed it yesterday. After installing and setting up everything, the problem was still present. I used a hardware monitor to check everything, and the only that stood out as odd was the GPU, it had a considerably high spike in the memory usage, and was the only thing to do so. After a quick Google search of how do I know if my GPU is failing, the number one issue stated was frequent lagging or stuttering. So at this point, with near all other options exhausted, I believe I've found the culprit.

This got me wondering, what could've caused this? The obvious answers I found were, overheating, excessive dirt and dust, over-clocking, poor ventilation, and a bad power supply. Now, I don't know if any of these are the reason, and I'm not saying none of them are, but the power supply is the one that came with the computer, I haven't over-clocked my hard drive, it came with several fans already installed, it's in a ventilated area, and it's not even two months old so I doubt the amount dust on there was enough to suffocate it.

The questions I have are related to potential reasons that could've caused the GPU to fail in the first place. 

1. I have my desktop plugged into an inexpensive (aka cheap) power strip. It's only a power strip, and I don't believe it is a surge protector at all. Could this be a reason?

2. Due to my house, living room, and general life situation (read as, I have a two year old,) I play my desktop on 48 inch 4k tv, and not a monitor. Could this be an issue?

3. Last question. The only standard reason I feel could be responsible, is overheating. I don't feel as if it is, but if I had to pick a reason, it would be this one. What are some things I can do to reduce the heat further, and also monitor the temperature constantly?

fp9rbd,FPS_Warex,Can I add another wifi throught a new router / switch?,"**TL;DR: Can I connect the router to another router/swich to create a new wifi in the same house?**

&amp;#x200B;

Hey! I just moved to an apartment building, where there is one router in the basement which supplies wifi to about 3-4 apartments if im not mistaken.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm a bit unsure of the connection on the router (he said it was the lowest fiber plan they had, so either 40/40 or 80/80) 

[Speedtest](https://i.imgur.com/L5EbQUl.png)

The problem is that the wifi signal seems to be quite weak and I cant even load up 1080p videos on youtube consistently. And I'm a gamer, so being able to download games is kinda nice (a must)

Had to relocate my PC to parents house multiple times just to update games (fucking R6 with their 80gb update)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the landlord is friend of dad's and quite a nice guy, we also had a deal to draw a cable up to my apartment (has a tube running through the center of the house)

&amp;#x200B;

But my question is, what can I do with that cable?

First thought was just a simple switch and lay down some cables for my PC, potentially even my TV (but that would make it too stationary, not able to move it closer to couch for gaming)

But is there a way I can either get a swich which is able to create a new wifi for my apartment (so my TV, phone, tablets will be ""working"") or a router to do the same? Heard there might be some issues with the IP adress of the ""new"" wifi or somthing?

&amp;#x200B;

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated :)

I came back to it on but no signal on monitor and no power to keyboard and mouse. I've tried going back to a restore point before following the youtube video and still not working so I don't think that's the problem.

Video Card #2NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970

Operating SystemWindows 10

But it had been working fine, the only thing I could think of is if I had a pre-existing virus or something that was causing this but surely that would've done this sooner. Anyway, right now when I turn my pc off it does the above again, power to the pc but no keyboard or mouse power and no signal to keyboard. I have figured out that if I take one stick of RAM out (I have two 8gb RAM) and start it up on just one it all boots up and powers everything fine. I then it off, insert the other stick of RAM and start it up again and it works. But then I power it off at the end of the day and have to repeat those steps again the next morning. This has been happening for a week-ish now and it's just getting time consuming and annoying to do everyday.

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

fp9iy7,TheCrimsonJin,My Laptop is Overheating in a very strange way.,"Laptop Model: Acer Predator Helios 300, 2017 edition.

CPU: 7700HQ

GPU: Nvidia 1060 6GB

RAM: 16BG

STORAGE: 256 GB SSD, 2 TB HDD (expanded)

**My core issues are these:** 

Whenever a program uses my GPU, my temps skyrocket to 95C-100C on both the CPU and GPU (as shown by Acer Predator Sense, MSI Afterburner, and Throttlestop), **even it's just 10% usage** happening. In addition to this, I cannot really play games with this GPU anymore because every time I use it, it **frequently throttles** and games stutter heavily, due to the thermals I believe. 

Things to note: The cooling on this laptop has always been bad, ever since I got it in 2017. That being said, I rarely had **throttling** issues and only when the load on the CPU/GPU was nearing 100%. Yes, I know using it like this has been bad. 

**I have tried repasting it** and cleaning the fans very recently, to no avail. Same temps, same issues. No worse, no better.  I have also **tried undervolting** to the max I can.

I am beginning to suspect I have a **bitcoin miner** on my PC. Any guides to checking that possibility/getting rid of it would be much appreciated.

fp94iw,akshat1235,Got a new FibreOptic Connection.,"And got into some problems. My previous connection was a wireless one with promised speeds of 16MBps and now we have upgraded to a Fibre To The Home which boasts speeds upto 50MBps.

We weren't facing the following problem with our previous 16MBps Connection:

So we are getting the speeds as promised i.e. 6Mbps down. But the issue is that this speed is only achievable on my desktop which is connected to the router through a LAN wire. On our mobile phones and laptops the speeds are intolerable at 20-50Kbps which isn't even sufficient to load a webpage or download an image.

Now the Facts:-

1.) When connecting my laptop with the LAN wire I am getting the same 6Mbps as the desktop.

2.) While watching a youtube video or downloading a big file I am getting the promised speeds on my laptop even when it is connected wireless through WiFi.

3.) Even on my desktop (connected through LAN) the web pages aren't loading and require clicking the reload button 5-6 times.

So all in all the events requiring huge and continuous usage of the internet like downloading a Game or watching a video are running good but that involves only like 10% of our time and the other 90% is involved in social media, scrolling through the wall, chatting, sharing images, surfing the internet and all that has become really quite frustrating.

The problem can't be device specific because I have tried on a laptop, a desktop and 5 different smartphones.

My Router is a Dlink DIR-615 updated to the latest firmware version.

My connection is a broadband fibre to the home connection connected via an old dysfunctional landline.

Are there any router settings which may resolve this issue. Or any other solution.

Help would be really appreciated as in this lockdown period all our work and daily life requires the internet.

Dusted off a friends PC from 2012 yesterday to see if it still worked. Turned on okay, restarted a few times and managed to log in. Only problem is it probably only lasts 5 minutes max before it completely freezes. It's only made it to a blue screen once and the error was CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT.

The processor is not overclocked.

First thing I did was try two completely different boot drives. Another on Windows 10 and one of Linux, both freeze. I tried running with 1 stick of ram, tried reseating both sticks, fiddled all the power connections to the mobo, booted without GPU (GTX 660) etc. I ran a memtest on the sticks and they're both fine.

With this issue people normally suggest upping your core voltage or reducing your overclock. The chip is not overclocked and the motherboard, Gigabyte Z77-DS3H has no facility for changing processor Vcore manually (This is not fixable with a BIOS update). I can change the clock multiplier but if he has to run underclocked to 3GHz with no turbo then he may as well buy a new PC.

Is the mobo/cpu/PSU just busted? CPU temp reads 40C in the BIOS, 38C when underclocked by half. There are no obvious problems at a glance with the board or any of the components. I dusted the insides just to be sure it wasn't thermals.

fp8l5m,HopefullyVirusFree,Creating a Windows 1909 install USB from Ubuntu,"Hi, I've been having issues booting the Windows installer from a USB key. I downloaded the Windows ISO yesterday, and I tried:

* Creating an MBR and a FAT32 partition, copying the contents of the ISO on the key. This fails because `sources/install.wim` is 4.6GB large, too large for FAT32.
* Doing the same with exFAT: key not detected by the UEFI.
* Doing the same with a GPT partition table: key not detected.
* `dd`ing the ISO to the key (`/dev/sda` or `/dev/sda1`): key not detected.
* Using [WoeUSB](https://github.com/slacka/WoeUSB): fails in FAT32 because of the large file. In NTFS, took a crazy amount of time (several hours), got detected by the UEFI, but when I try to boot it, it seems to fail and fall back to the next valid UEFI boot entry (Dell diagnostics).

I don't know what to do. Ideally, I'd like to do it the simple way: format the key, mount the ISO, copy the ISO's files on the key manually, so that the partition stays usable.

fp865m,BeardlyFunny,Issue with ping after installing WI-FI repeater?,"So due to the quarantine my mom has to work from home, in a room where the wifi from our router just doesn't cut it (Location: from right to left it's: the living room with the router, my room and the room she works in where the wifi keeps cutting out). Deciding to help her out I set up a wifi repeater in my room, so that she has strong reliable wifi, and I assumed it would not affect me as my PC uses an ethernet cable with around 13 mb/s download.

After deciding to play some smite I noticed all of a sudden my ping now doesn't want to go below 100 and likes to spike up to 300, which as you can imagine makes the game unplayable. At first I didn't even suspect the repeater because I forgot I set it up. So I tried out WTFast thinking it was the shitty smite routing from servers, and it did indeed reduce my ping to 45-65 but really not that stable. I was okay with this but my ping seems to sometimes spike up to the 100-120 range (so far twice in 2 days). 

Naturally this pissed me off and I got a blitz of realization that it could be the wifi repeater I installed for my mom. So I plugged it out of it's socket, checked my ping and low and behold my ping dropped down to it's normal amount 50 (this is a smite thing, other games I have about 20).

I'm pretty sure buying a new and better router would fix the need for the repeater and naturally my issue, but since all shops are closed for at least 1 more month that just wont work right now.

Is there any way I can troubleshoot this from home?",2,1585212598,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp865m/issue_with_ping_after_installing_wifi_repeater/,techsupport,1

I am like you. Removed from the comforts of work and propped up at my kitchen table with books for monitor stands. Hope you are all keeping safe and well considering.

So my issue is we use a piece of software which I have a license for. However every time I want to boot up this software, I need to plug the laptop in to an Ethernet connection. ANY ethernet connection. It's just how the license works. So I am at the kitchen table, I need to go downstairs 2 floors to the router ( big building ) and plug it in. Then boot the software.

Why this doesn't seem like a big issue? True but the nature of this program is extremely heavy on resources. Dozens of times a day I need to close it to open a 3D drawing program and communications programs etc.

I will procure a second laptop but in the meantime, is there anyway at all I can trick this laptop in to thinking I have it plugged in to an ethernet connection?

fp7o0c,SHIV3RR,Strange FPS issue on new laptop.,"I recently bought a new gaming laptop, Acer Triton 500 running intel core i7-8750 and nvidia geforce rtx 2060 with 144hz.

I installed games such as overwatch and rainbow six siege for the first time and they were running normal FPS, 190-200FPS for overwatch, and around 120-150FPS for rainbow six siege. A few hours later i launched overwatch again, and i was getting only an average of 120FPS with a lot of screen tearing in overwatch. I then enabled V-sync and it fixed the screen tearing but i only got 60FPS.I read some reddit posts and disabled full screen optimisations on overwatch.exe, while that fixed the screen tearing i now only get around 90FPS for overwatch, and i know that my laptop can run it at a much higher fps, thus i found it strange.

Next is rainbow six siege, today i noticed it ran at 60-70FPS when i was in game, and it confused me as it should be running at 120-150FPS. 

Does anyone know what issues im having and possibly how to fix them? Thanks again for taking time to read on my issues.",0,1585209696,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp7o0c/strange_fps_issue_on_new_laptop/,techsupport,1

fp79ac,FrazAFC94,Stuck in the automatic repair loop / system drive too small,"This is my first time posting and I’m at my wits end with this laptop so I would be forever in your debt if someone could solve this.

A few weeks ago I was being hassled to update Windows on my HP Laptop Model 14-cm0983na however I kept putting it off as it requires additional storage space and I only have 32 GB on the laptop (I know, absolutely nothing).

Eventually I caved and borrowed a hard drive to allow me to undertake the update. It downloaded and took ages to begin installing however it crashed at 16% and now my laptop has been stuck in the dreaded “automatic repair loop.”

I’ve tried multiple solutions including YouTube tutorials to try and get out of this but none some to have worked. The only option that has given me some progress is using a 64GB USB drive as a recovery drive. This lets me choose my keyboard layout and then when I click the “Recover from a drive” option it thinks about starting before informing me, “unable to recover your PC. The system drive is too small.”

Does this mean my laptop is now completely redundant? Is there anything that can be done to fix this?

It’s quite urgent this is sorted as with COVID-19, I’m required to work from home and usually I would have taken this to a repair shop but with the UK in lockdown, that’s not an option. 

Once again, I appreciate any assistance I can receive with this.

TLDR: Windows update crashed, stuck in the repair loop. Only option that lets me progress is using recovery drive but that flags up as being “system drive too small”",6,1585207399,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp79ac/stuck_in_the_automatic_repair_loop_system_drive/,techsupport,1

When I install the card, I get POST code beeps and it won’t boot. 3 low 3 high repeated 5 times. This is an HP Odense 2-s so I believe this code means bios timed out waiting for graphics card.. The graphics card is a Radeon hd 7970.  The fan for the gpu comes on along with the other fans. After the post beeps the pc seems to stay “on” but there is no image on the monitor.  I did see a brief flash of a distorted image of the Linux splash screen appear for a moment one time after the beeps were done.  It’s running 19.3 Linux mint. I am not super tech savvy, especially with terminal and grub on Linux. So my question is the graphics card bad? Could this maybe be solved by trying the nomodeset or compatibility mode in Linux to try to get the built in drivers to work?  Does the BIOS need to be updated? It is AMI F.03 revision 5.11.  I tried the bios jumper reset. Could it be a power issue?

fp6xsh,GorgeShrinks,Cannot register front line-in and rear line-in audio devices as two different devices,"Desktop build, Windows 10 v1909, ASUS B450F-strix mobo. I recently switched over from a USB headset to a pair with separate line-in and mic-in jacks. The rear panel has a speaker system occupying the green line-in port, so this headset must use the case's front port. The issue is now that whenever the headset is plugged in, SupremeFX (Realtek HD audio manager) prompts for selection between ""Headphone"" and ""Front Speaker Out"". Selecting headphone, the audio switches to the headset, but playback devices only shows ""Speaker (Realtek Audio)"", with no ability to change to the speakers in the rear port. The latest Realtek drivers have been downloaded from Asus' site. I uninstalled all drivers to do a sanity check, wherein both headphones and speakers became playback devices, but this unsurprisingly disabled some of the levels options I need for mic monitoring.

Reinstalled latest drivers to no avail. If the headset is unplugged while music is playing the speakers will play, thus ruling out any loose connections. HD audio manager is showing both front line-in and rear line-in ports as occupied. I wouldn't mind just unplugging and replugging in the headset everytime I wanted to switch except the herculean grip the front panel has on these jacks really ups frustration levels to the red zone.",4,1585205669,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp6xsh/cannot_register_front_linein_and_rear_linein/,techsupport,1

fp6ucd,ascendocatto,Nintendo Switch booting up into an error screen,"After a couple days of Animal Crossing fun, one morning my Switch suddenly wouldn't boot up. It shows the Nintendo and the Switch logos like normal, but after that it goes into an error screen, simply saying an ""Error has occured"", giving instructions on how to soft reset the console, a link to the Nintendo Support website, and the Switch's serial code and software version. This Switch is around 1 year and 3 months old, fully updated, and never had this error screen before. It has had problems with Joy-con drift a few months ago (which was fixed), and the speakers not working due to something weird in the settings, which actually occured shortly before this current problem. But, I'm not sure if either of these would stop the console from booting up entirely. As far as I know, this Switch wasn't dropped, stepped on, or otherwise damaged in recent times. Also, when I said I was playing Animal Crossing, I don't mean for days on end without giving the console a break, I was playing it reasonably.

I looked on the Nintendo Switch support site along with several forums, me and my brother tried:

-Simply turning off and turning back on (just clicking the power button)

-Soft resetting as the error screen instructed

-Plugging in the AC adapter directly and soft resetting

-Letting the console charge then turning it on

-Unplugging the AC adapter and leaving it for 30 seconds, plugging it directly into the console and resetting

It still ends up the same way. The only option we found that we haven't tried is a factory reset. Now, I know how to enter maintenence mode and initialize the system, and understand that the game data wouldn't be deleted. But, it would render anything in the microSD unusuable, which I have a lot of stuff on there, so I'm trying to avoid that, but I will still consider it if there is no alternative. My brother is willing to bring it into a shop for repairs, but I'd feel guilty spending his money. Is there anything else I could try to get it working?

After that, I ran two virus scans, one with my preferred MalwareBytes and one with McAfee (only use bc dad pays for it.)

fp6ezk,Paukward,"Facebook &amp; Messenger App (Android) ""Please confirm your identity"" loop","Good day,

I think this is a rare problem but I hope someone can help me and resolve this. I've reformatted my phone (Samsung s7) then I tried to log in on my facebook account. Everytime I log in, facebook asks me for identity confirmation. Once completed, it just go back to the identity confirmation again like a loop until I wait again for 2-3 hours before I go back and sign in. (Because I reached the limit of getting security codes on email.) I cannot access my FB + MESSENGER on **my phone** now because of this. I think it has something to do with authorized devices settings? I googled this issue for days now and haven't found same problem as mine.

**-Already tried clearing data and cache of all Facebook and Messenger related apps but still nothing. I also installed CC Cleaner.**

**-Uninstalled Facebook and re-install. Still nothing.**

**-Tried logging in on messenger. Still on loop.**

**-Used data mode to login. Failed. Still on loop.**

**-FYI. My facebook app is the latest version.**

**-I can open my facebook on mac. But when I try to log in on my android, it locks my fb acct. on ALL devices and go on loop.**

**-Tried logging in on chrome browser and friendly for facebook on android, it worked but it is so hard to use especially with messenger.**

**-I am not using VPN.**

**-Already did factory reset twice, still on loop.**

\-Here's the image that show whats on the loop: [SAMPLE](https://i.imgur.com/qdK37Ec.jpg)

fp6ea9,SkyFire4-13,Is there any way to recover deleted Google Chrome browsing history from an Android phone?,"Is there any way to recover deleted browsing history from Google Chrome on an android phone? I know the date and time frame on said date for the particular website in question and it was right before I stopped using that phone and got a new one, so the history I want should be relatively fresh.. I do not have a google account, so no, I can't go to the My Activity and see it, so that option is out. Is there any kind of software that I can download that can recover the history?  This is really important. I don't want to go into details, but I really need to recover it. If there's no software available, are there any kind of professional technical or IT services who can do it (I live near a city)?

I'm not a tech person, but I'm honestly surprised that it's so hard to recover deleted browsing history...

Any help on this issue would be appreciated! For some details in the issue/situation:

- I’ve been having this issue for about a week and it occurs when I watch anything and in games.
- I have updated my graphics driver and checked for any updates on other drivers. 
- I have windows 10, an intel cpu, nvidia graphics card, and integrated graphics (not sure if you need the specifics)
- The laptop is about 2-3 years old.

I’ve been getting warned that the battery cannot supply enough power to the system, however, the laptop is always plugged in and it’s given me this warning for quite some time and there’s been no issue previously.
I believe the issue is potentially unrelated to the battery and if anyone has any idea what it might be that would be appreciated! (It may just be the battery lol)

fp604c,VampyricKing,Kernel Error 41. PC restarts when playing certain games.,"Alright, I'll try my best to describe everything in as much detail as possible.

**What is my issue?**

My issue is when playing certain games my PC seems to reboot itself like it would if you would just press the restart option. I've had this issue in the past where it just happens randomly. I got rewarded a new PC case so then I switched cases. and when I did that my issue somehow resolved itself for about a month. Now it restarts when playing games. I did research on these games and they both seem to be CPU intensive. (Games in question are Escape From Tarkov - uses a lot of real-time physics, and Rainbow Six Siege - guessing from physics as well.) Both games are set on low graphic settings and it usually happens when I'm trying to load into a game. I can leave it in the main menu and nothing would happen but the second I look for a game my system restarts.

**Computer Specs**

CPU: Ryzen 5 3600(Using stock cooler with no Overclock)

MOBO: MSI B450 M-2 MAX

RAM: VulcanZ 2x8GB 3200MHZ

GPU: EVGA RTX 2060 SC(No overclock)

PSU: Seasonic S12III 500w 80+ Bronze

I'm currently running 4 fans 3 which are Corsair's LL120 RGB fans and 1 NZXT fan that came with the case. Heard sometimes the number of connected devices could be an issue so what I have connected are My KB, Mouse, and Printer.

**What have I done to attempt to resolve this?**

* ran sfc /scannow on admin cmd and once that finished it said it repaired some corrupted files.
* ran chkdsk /f /r
* Edited the following settings in my power plan(AMD Ryzen Balance)
   * Turned off Fast Startup
   * set ""Turn off hard disk after"" to 0
   * set the following to never ""Sleep After"", ""Allow Hybrid Sleep"", ""Allow Wake Timers""
* Checked for any duplicated audio drivers. The only drivers I have are
   * High Definition Audio Device
   * NVIDIA High Definition Audio
   * NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible) (WDM)
* Flashed my bios to the current version(Latest is in Beta so I did not install that one but the one below it)
* Reset Bio settings to default
* Looked at the event viewer. Kernel Error 41 - BugCheckCode is 0
* Checked if my PSU cables were loose
* Ran Windows RAM Diagnostics - Got no errors.
* Ran a drivers updater program and said everything was up to date, even went into device manager and all said were up to date.",7,1585200747,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp604c/kernel_error_41_pc_restarts_when_playing_certain/,techsupport,1

fp5t4e,xAndRaxiusx,Infrequent yet very annoying lag spikes/stutters with a RTX2070 Super,"Hello! I've been trying to solve this issue for the better part of a week now, all the threads I've found on similar issues seem to just drag on and not get resolved, so I decided I'd write a new one and see what happens.

The Issue : At seemingly random intervals when gaming, my fps will go to 0 for several milliseconds, and the GPU usage will drop to 0% (not sure if this is correlational or causational). Other than that the framerates are absolutely stellar, but when playing a competitive game or VR it is really aggrivating. This occurs on every game I've played.

The Stats : Ryzen 7 3700x OC'd to around 4.0Ghz, temps are around 59C at max load

EVGA RTX2070 Super Black Gaming, max load is around 60-65 depending on the title

G.Skill Trident DDR4 @ 3600 (yes XMP is enabled)

I have an SSD running my OS, games are stored on a Seagate 7200 2TB HDD

Corsair 750w Gold Rated PSU 

Asus TUF Gaming x570 MOBO

Things I've Already Tried : 

* Removing OC/Underclocking CPU and GPU
* Using DDU in Safe Mode to clean install latest drivers
* Clean Windows Installation
* Disabling Game Bar and Xbox DVR crap
* Updating/Checking for driver issues
* Fiddling with power settings and Nvidia Control Panel, everything's optimized there
* Enabling G-SYNC
* Disabling Dynamic Tick

At this point I'm not really sure what to do. I really don't want to RMA the card (or whatever's causing the problem), and I honestly don't think it's a hardware fault, everything else about my system exceeds my expectations. Any starting advice on things I haven't tried yet? Thank you &lt;3",1,1585199786,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp5t4e/infrequent_yet_very_annoying_lag_spikesstutters/,techsupport,1

I have a desktop running Windows 10 that was using two monitors; one was an ASUS monitor and the other was a DELL 1704FPT. Both worked fine and I had no issues setting it up at all.

I took the Dell monitor and tried to use it with my laptop in my room, but when I plug it in (using a HDMI to DVI cord)  sometimes Windows does not detect it and I have to restart for it to show up. Once it shows up in Display Settings, I'll be able to drag tabs off of my main laptop screen (so Windows detects that a monitor exists and lets me use a second display; I can move my mouse offscreen and all that) but my monitor does not show anything.

The monitor knows that its supposed to receive some sort of input, as when I unplug the cable from my laptop it shows the default floating box, but when I plug the wire in it just says 

""2: Digital Input 

In Power Save Mode

Press Any Key on keyboard or mouse""

Nothing I do from my laptop affects this. After displaying this message for a second, it goes into sleep mode (and the power button turns orange instead of green).

I tested the monitor and cable by plugging said cable into my Nintendo Switch, where it worked perfectly fine and without any hassle. But when it's plugged into my laptop the monitor shows nothing.

This seems like some kind of driver issue but poking around in Windows settings and Google has gotten me nowhere. Does anyone have any ideas? Thanks in advance.",0,1585198572,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp5k50/dell_1704fpt_monitor_issue_with_windows_10/,techsupport,1

I was going to build a whole new pc, but the COVID-19 hit us hard and money can't be spend as much as I wanted to. So the question - which to upgrade now and use later in the new setup (in a year probably).

Q1: Is it better if I buy ""Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER 8 GB AORUS"" only right now and use it with my new build later?

Q2: Is it better if I buy ""Intel Core i7-9700K"" and ""Gigabyte Z390 AORUS ULTRA ATX LGA1151"" and use it for ""core"" for a later upgrade?

Q3: Which bottleneck is worse (or less worse) - i7-9700k with GTX 1060 6B or i5-6500 with Gigabyte GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER? !!! 144hz 1440p !!!

fp5ih8,CakeDayOrDeath,Error Message at Startup,"I have a laptop running Windows 10.

Since yesterday, when I've been booting up the laptop, I get a blue screen that says ""ERROR Verification Failed (15) Access Denied"" with an ""OK"" button below. When I click the ""OK"" button, my computer continues to boot up and otherwise behaves normally.

I have tried the advice from Microsoft to do a hard restart; it didn't help. The other piece of advice I have found is to turn off Secure Boot.

My questions:

1) What does this error mean?

2) Do I need to address it? As in, will anything happen down the line that's worse than a scary-looking message at startup?

3) My SO recently helped me turn on virtualization in BIOS, and I started getting this error message when I booted up the computer after he did that. Is it a coincidence?

4) I recently started and didn't complete an installation of an Android Emulator that was supposed to dual boot Android. Could *this* be related to the error message?

5) My hard drive is getting close to the end of its lifespan. Could *that* be related to the error message?

fp5f7x,KoopaTryhard,Second Wifi with the same name as mine,"Hello all,

So I don't know what exactly this is, but I've got a second wifi access point that has the same name as My own. I've got a router with two networks set up on it already; ""IP sitting down""(2.4 gHz), and ""The Year 5000X""(5 gHz). Looking at \[this image\]([https://imgur.com/gallery/teA4MRW](https://imgur.com/gallery/teA4MRW)), you can see that there is an ""IP sitting down 2"" in the list of accessible networks. I can connect to this network and it functions just the same as the original network, but I'm wondering why it's there. The router is a Linksys EA3500 and I have a VPN to help conceal my data, but something about this seems suspicious. I've looked at my router settings and it only shows the one ""IP sitting down"". If anyone has any ideas as to what this might be I would be very grateful.

fp52le,_A_Nerd,"PC crashed idly and now I can't boot Windows, can't troubleshoot through blue screen"," 

Hey everyone. 

First time poster here. I would say I’m more computer literate than the average person but I’m a noob compared to you guys.

I bought a custom built PC from IBUYPOWER a couple years ago, and this is the first problem I’ve had like this. Here are the specs listed on the amazon product page, I haven’t made any changes to it. If you need more info let me know.

Intel Core i7-8700K Six-Core Processor 3.7 GHz (4.7 GHz Max Turbo) | 16GB DDR4 RAM | 1TB   
HDD | 240GB SSD | Genuine Windows 10 Home 64-bit

I should mention that although I have an SSD I hadn’t configured to boot from it, I just use it for a some game data storage.

Two nights ago I left my computer for a few minutes and when I came back it had crashed. Now, when I turn it on the screen I see my motherboard brand (MSI Z370) and it trying to automatic repair. When that doesn’t work, it eventually sends me to the windows blue screen. This blue screen menu is a little different than the menus I’ve seen in some youtube videos because there is no “reset this PC” option. The options on the blue screen that I see are : 

Startup repair, System restore, Command Prompt, Uninstall Updates, UEFI Firmware Settings,   
System Image Recovery

Startup repair and System restore don’t do anything. 

When I use System Image Recovery I get error message: STATUS\_WAIT\_2(0x80070002)

When I use command prompt to look up the directory of my C drive, (my main hard drive), instead I see the contents of my SSD. I would think this is some kind of clue but I don’t know what it means fully.

Is this enough information to diagnose the problem or at least start? Any idea if this is a hardware or software issue? If my data is lost?

One troubleshooting option that was suggested to me was using a boot drive and reinstalling windows from a USB. If thats the way I should go, how does that work with respect to keeping old data?

I very much appreciate any help and feedback.

fp4seh,Leonsilverleaf,Samsung Galaxy S8 shutting off in my pocket.,"My sister had this phone for about a year, then gave it to me. I've had it for maybe 5-6 months. The other day, I pulled it out of my pocket, and realized it was restarting. Thought it might've automatically updated, so I ignored it. Happened again just 5 minutes later when I pulled it out again. Then, it shut off while I was using it. I knew I had fully charged it from the night before, but I tried charging it assuming that it might've been displaying the battery's power level incorrectly, or maybe I didn't plug it in all the way. Didn't work. I did remember feeling, what I assumed was, the battery shifting around a couple times before this when I'd pick it up, move it, etc. I couldn't get it to turn on again, so I held it upside down, gave it a little yank, felt the piece move inside, and then it turned on when I held the button. I'd open it up and try to figure it out, but upon watching a video about taking one apart... I realize that you're really not supposed to. I don't know if the battery is just shifting out of place somehow and can't power the phone without being in a specific spot, if it's just bad, or what... but I need this phone, of course, for calls from work, alarms, all that stuff. Not sure what I can do to fix the issue. I'd rather not buy a new phone as I'm not in a great spot to do that right now. I'm also not sure it's worth taking somewhere to fix... the only place I know of nearby charged me $80 to replace an iPhone screen, which I had done 3 different times, and each time the screen had problems within a few days.

fp4nz4,909xj,Wireless Headset issues,"So I received a brand new Steelseries Arctis Wireless Pro headset in the mail today, awesome headset all around and amazing features btw. I do have the transmitter USB connected straight to my PC and that's how I'm hearing through the headset. I do have a slight problem with the headphones that hopefully some of you can help me figure out...

As the headset audio is ON and connected, the headset disconnects then reconnects almost every 10 seconds. It's almost as if the device unpairs then repairs on its own pretty much. When the headset disconnects it disconnects for about 3 seconds and then reconnects on its own. (I've tried restarting both devices and un/repairing, nothing worked.

Do any of you who are familiar with Steelseries headsets know how I can solve this issue? I've contacted Steelseries earlier but I won't be hearing from them for at least another day or two. If anybody can help me out that'd be very much appreciated.

fp4d77,XOR042,Are RESET/POWER switches on Corsair 760T case easy to accidentally trigger?,"I run my current aging workstation 24/7 with a myriad tasks like multiple home office backups, system monitoring, media creation, and an endless list of other apps. I plan to replace it with a 760T holding a 8-12 core I9.  

When I reach down to my current tower case for any reason, such as to insert headphones, mics, USB sticks, or optical disks, it's RESET switch is right on the front panel near the top but not right on top edge like the 760T.  Even so, it is VERY easy to accidentally trigger a devastating reset than can days of nitty-gritty backup or workflow rebuilds - not to mention possible disk corruption. 

With the 760T's reset and power switches being right on the very top edge of the front panel, it looks DANGEROUSLY easily to blow your system with an accidental reset or power down.

Does anyone have any experience with this case and the ease with which the RESET and/or POWER switch are triggered?  That is, does do they require a long press, press with extra pressure, or both?  If not, is there a safety cover or latch for it?  

For my current PC case, I had to tape a piece of plastic over the RESET switch with gaffer's tape.  It's kludgy, falls off after a while, and looks rinky-dink.  Yes, I could disconnect the wires but I need the RESET for those infrequent times when the system locks, I need a soft restart, and don't want to wait 5-8 minutes for my mobo's BIOS boot sequence to run which can also trigger a possible MBR corruption issue on a full power cycle.  You see, I have 10+ drives and 16+ USB connections so the BIOS cold start's device and memory scans take forever!

Any thoughts would be appreciated.",1,1585193206,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp4d77/are_resetpower_switches_on_corsair_760t_case_easy/,techsupport,1

fp3zs1,distorted_doggo,GPU cutting out when bumped and getting slightly warm,"Got a free GPU with some issues. The GPU in qestion is an MSI Armor RX 570 with 8gb of vram. Was in my cousins PC for about a year and he decided to reuse it for his new custom pc that I built for him. In the old PC this problem happened rarely and could be managed. But now it is impossible to play games for more than 10 minutes without the thing crashing. When it crashes it goes to whatever color on the screen was most prominent. Its not an overheating issue, the card rarely reaches 60 degrees celcius when in a game. It doesnt just crash when it gets warm, it also crashes when it is moved bumped or even just tapped lightly. The interesting thing is, it doesnt react to bumps when its idling at temps of 30 degrees celcius, only when it reaches higher temps. Another interesting thing is it is much harder to make it crash when moving it upwards, when I press downwards on it it crashes much more easily. Thought it may have only been a problem with the  ports so i tried with all 3 DP ports, the hdmi and the DVI port, all had the same issues. Tried it in 3 different PCs and all had the same problem. I even connected a second display to my integrated gpu and played games with the card while afterburner was running on the second screen. When the card crashed it took the other display with it, freezing it. Luckily I was able to take a picture of the temps and utilization while the screen was frozen. Any Ideas on why this was happening? I thought it may have been a broken capacitor or there were fractures on the pcb, but i found nothing.

Sadly, it started disconnecting and the quickest fix I figured was to jiggle the USB connection to make it reconnect. This somewhat worked, but I knew I needed a better fix. Figured it was likely the USB as it was many years old at this point. 

Proceed to me getting a new one and it doesn't do much of anything. The connection continues to connect then later just drop and requiring a jiggle routine to make reconnect. I've checked drivers, checked the properties and mingled what I can in it, but nothing seems to work. As of now, it just won't connect at all despite clearly detecting the network and it's previous times of connecting.

My only theory at this point is that the wifi port is somehow utterly fucked at this point, but I know not how to check that or how to even fix it if it even is the issue.

fp3hll,levider4444,I get Blackouts of my PC while playing on my Valve Index," 

Howdy,

Ok, so I, more recently, have been lucky enough to get a hold of a Valve Index, and I really enjoy it! but, usually while playing, and almost at seemingly random times my PC 'blackouts'. What I mean by that is that the screens on my headset pause suddenly, usually with either solid color lines or no color at all, and then go black. My screens follow a similar routine during the blackout. The one RGB strip on my pc seems to not be affected, and the fans still run. I know that my hardware should be suitable- I have a Sapphire brand Rx-590, a AMD Ryzen 5 2400G with the internal graphics disabled (as far as I can tell) and I am running it off of a standard SSD. I have a couple of other components that I really don't think are necessary to mention, other than maybe that I have 3 mismatch monitors that I picked up from various thrift stores. All of this is running windows 10 (though I lost my key so rip).

My original thought is that the powersupply could be a bit flaky or just a tad bit underpowered. I just bought a new PSU 100W over my last one (it now being a 750W), but the problem has persisted, and while it could be paranoia, it almost seems worse.

It happens for every VR game I own, save for beat saber, and the only Non-Vr game that it occurs in is KSP.

On a final note, i've watched my CPU and GPU in the games where the blackout happens and I don't think I'm maxing out either part in most cases. In Vr there are spikes of usage, but both parts seem to rest somewhere around 50-70% use. In KSP, I somehow max out my CPU on the menus and hub overlooking the space center. As soon as I start to actually play the game portion, there is barely any usage over 50%.

To say I'm at a loss would be an understatement. I'd really appreciate any suggestions y'all have. Thank",3,1585189502,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp3hll/i_get_blackouts_of_my_pc_while_playing_on_my/,techsupport,1

All machines are using Office 2019 on Windows 10, and they all have the same issue.",0,1585188958,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp3cno/can_you_share_outlook_2019_calendars_without/,techsupport,1

I have an early 2013 Macbok Pro (Thunderbolt V1 I believe). I am looking to get some new HD enclosures but EVERYWHERE online sells TB3 everything and few sites have the older obsolete stuff.

fp35ni,Zireael1253,PC Shuts down when gaming,"So this doesn't happen often and usually only happens with newer games for example when I was playing Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order I got to the Zeffo Planet and when the landing scene started playing and we got close to the planet the game not only crashed but made my entire PC shut down as well now I was looking around and realized you can fix it by going all medium settings and windowed mode I played the game on ultra and didn't have any lag issues so that weirded me out but I thought it was only that game but now when I was playing Black Mesa I got to the Xen planet and jumped over a live fence and saw steam coming out of a hole which I thought was where I was supposed to go and the game crashed and shutdown my pc just like star wars did,and it's another game I play on ultra with no lag issues after it shuts down my pc just like starwars the same thing happens my PC turns on automatically and the gpu fans kick in and start doing insane RPM and it goes back to working like normal it also happened on Shadow of the tomb raider at one random part of the game idk what it is and am seriously worried I need help.",7,1585188174,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp35ni/pc_shuts_down_when_gaming/,techsupport,1
fp34g7,You_Stealthy_Bastard,"So many new parts, still no life","Hi, 

I recently built a PC. I've built several, and never had an issue like this. The build: 

[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/phtRCL](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/phtRCL)

Issue 1: My dumbass ordered a micro ATX board, there wasn't room for both the GPU (extra thicc) and the wifi card. However, it booted up right away and I installed Windows 10 on the SSD. No issues. I unassembled, shipped back the Mobo and ordered a new one.

New Mobo comes,  [MSI Performance Gaming AMD X470 Ryzen 2 AM4 DDR4 Onboard Graphics CFX ATX Motherboard (X470 Gaming Plus)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CF31C1Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 

I set everything up, no life to the board at all. Not even the debug lights. Triple checked every single connection, not even so much as a spinning fan. I took it to a computer repair place with just the CPU/cooler, mobo, case, PSU, and Ram. They said the Mobo wasn't responsive. I order a new one:

I put everything back together, still absolutely nothing. I called a different repair place, they said it could be the PSU since the one I had was only 500w. I order one and pick it up today: 

 [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/corsair-cx-series-modular-cx750m-750w-80-plus-bronze-atx-power-supply-black/8324202.p?skuId=8324202](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/corsair-cx-series-modular-cx750m-750w-80-plus-bronze-atx-power-supply-black/8324202.p?skuId=8324202) 

I plug the PSU in, connect everything...and I'll bet you fine readers can guess what happened next. 

Absolutely. Freaking. Nothing. 

No lights, no sounds, the entire thing is completely unresponsive. My guess (and I'm betting that they'll tell me this when I take it to the 2nd repair place tomorrow morning) is that there's something wrong with the case. It has lots of various RGB cords and the whole setup seemed very fragile.

Any help/assurances/advice to bring back my sanity would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",1,1585188051,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fp34g7/so_many_new_parts_still_no_life/,techsupport,1
