Dual monitors used to work fine no problem until i took one of the monitors and cpu home for a bit to work from home. 

I dont know what happened. 

Both monitors work fine, the computer runs fine so it doesnt seem to be a damage issue. 

It just wont connect dual monitors. Ive tried multiple combinations with the HDMI and vba cables",13,1585699082,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsoffs/cant_connect_dual_monitors_any_more_more_details/,techsupport,1
fsoel9,Ur_Species_Fecies,Audio drivers specifically for beats?,"I've been having this problem for a while where I can hear stuff through the beats but can't use the mic to, let's say, talk in a game.

I am using an adapter, that's not the problem.

For me to be able to use the mic I gotta reinstall the audio driver on my PC after every shutdown or restart. 

I looked online and I came across something about audio drivers for beats, but it was for an HP system. My computer is custom built and I am using Win 10 64 bit. 

Do I need a specific audio driver for me to be able to use the beats normally? If so, where can I find it?",4,1585698994,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsoel9/audio_drivers_specifically_for_beats/,techsupport,1
fsodju,UniqueMemoir,"GPU being disabled after BSOD, Error 43","Hello everyone!So I've been having issues with my laptop lately (Lenovo Y50-70, GTX 960M, +5 years old). Ever since a few days ago, I've been getting a BSOD.

Today, I've been getting it more frequently, and when I check my device manager, Windows disables my GPU and says it's ""Error 43"". So I do a clean install of my GPU drivers, but it still does it.

The way it goes, more specifically, is that when I Alt-Tab from a game, my computer freezes for a bit (can still move my mouse though) and then I get a BSOD. After that, same thing, disabled GPU. So again, I do a clean install, I got to game for a couple of hours, but again, when I alt-tabbed, freezes, crashes, and then disabled GPU.

When I go into Reliability History, it says : Hardware Error, Live Kernel Event, Code 141 (or 1b0 sometimes)

Would it be worth trying to do clean reinstallation of Windows?

Is this the sign of a dying GPU?

fsocq5,stay-zen,Has anyone used “Intel Performance Maximizer” for overclocking their CPU?,"Their marketing claims it will automatically overclock your 9th gen chip based on your actual processor’s response to testing from this software. 

Even if the diagnostics were accurate, this would be extremely valuable. 

Obviously, it would also be great if we could just click a button after that as the marketing claims.",0,1585698805,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsocq5/has_anyone_used_intel_performance_maximizer_for/,techsupport,1
fsocps,tragiikx,USB tethering to my desktop suddenly stopped working.,"I moved recently and won't have internet for awhile, so yesterday I tried using my phones data for internet via USB tethering, and it worked pretty well. It was fast, and was even able to play some online games. However, after I got off work today it doesn't seem to work. On the bottom right corner of the taskbar it has the network connection icon, but nothing will load, and acts as if it's not connected. I didn't do anything differently, and can't figure this out. If anyone can help please let me know.",0,1585698804,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsocps/usb_tethering_to_my_desktop_suddenly_stopped/,techsupport,1
fsock1,Kiru4444,PC will not turn on at all,"Hey guys, my friend's PC will not turn on at all. To give a little bit of context, we were switching the components over from an old case to a new case that he bought. When we tried to turn it on, it didn't turn on. No boot, no fans spinning for a second and then turning off, nothing. I tried checking to see if it's the power supply that had died by doing the paperclip test, but the PSU actually turned on and was working fine. Then I tried to check if the wires were the problem by plugging everything in firmly. Nothing. 

I'm thinking the motherboard is the culprit cause I've seen a leak and I did smell something burning, but it was near the bottom of the motherboard/near the PSU. I don't know how to confirm that it is in fact the motherboard that is at fault. Even if it is, ASUS support won't pick up (thanks COVID-19) and their website, for some reason, won't let me submit an RMA. 

I'm completely lost on what to do. 

His build (if it matters):

AMD Ryzen 7 2700X

MSI Aero GTX 1070 Ti 

ASUS ROG STRIX B450-F Motherboard (Possibly the culprit)

Some no-name 500W PSU (Will get changed soon) 

WD 4 TB HDD  
Samsung 970 Evo 250 GB NvMe SSD

4 x Corsair LL120 

Cooler Master MasterBox MB511",5,1585698790,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsock1/pc_will_not_turn_on_at_all/,techsupport,1
fsoarc,chickenfoot4less,"My wifi signal has been slow for a few weeks now, resetting doesnt help.","I'm curious to see if there are any other ways to get my wifi to work as before? For example my house is 2 stories. Master bedroom is where I do my gaming on my ps4. It used to run fine with my wifi while playing multiplayer. Presently my wifi will suddenly lose strength off and on making it impossible to enjoy any multiplayer. 

I have the same router same internet package. It doesnt seem to do anything with the increased use of wifi from all the people quarantine atm since it started weeks before this. 

Will getting a product like the Netgear AC750 WiFi Range Extender (EX3110) help me at all?

fsoabr,AlyricalWhyisitTaken,My keyboard and mouse both decide to stop working at the same random time and I have to turn the computer off and on again to make them work,"Unplugging and plugging them again doesn't do anything, I have to restart the computer. This started happening 2 days ago, but it would only occur 1 time a day. Today, for some unknown reason it is the third time it happened.  
I've had a similar problem to this before: after some years that I had my computer, my mouse and keyboard started turn off at a presumably random time and I had to restart the computer. There were only 2 differences: They made the disconnecting noise when they decided to turn off and there was a clear correlation between playing heavier, more demanding games. Although the  turning off was inevitable, playing those more demanding games seemed to accelerate it. I could spend hours on Terraria or watching YouTube videos before the turn off happened but could only play 20 minutes of GTA.  
I fixed this problem by buying a new set of keyboard and mouse, which seemed to fix the problem and lead me to believe that it was only a hardware problem.
About a year has passed, and the problem started occuring again 2 days ago. This time, though, there is no disconnecting sound when the turn off happens (the mouse cursor disappears but that is the only sign that it happened besides me not being able to use the keyboard and mouse) and there seems to be no correlation between how demanding the game I'm playing is, and the time the turn of happens seems more random. It used to happen less frequently though.  
I don't know what to do, please help. If this is a hardware problem I can change the flair.",0,1585698572,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fsoabr/my_keyboard_and_mouse_both_decide_to_stop_working/,techsupport,1
